2882,0,t3_1u5qt9,What else can support TRP?This is actually the most important question in your entire post. See the problem with the PurplePill onthefenceuntilSciencetellsmedifferently perspective is in a fundamental misunderstanding. Were talking about human nature in general and intergender dynamics in particular which are things that have been thought about and written about and debated and most importantly experienced since forever. And see theres nothing wrong with reading up on science but when youre talking about the scientists behind the scienceA Most scientists are BetaOmega. You can argue this all day long but its a fact. Their bookishness and quiet dedication to cerebral pursuits admirable as those traits may be did not dispose them to developing social competence. So when they study sexual or social dynamics they are already operating at the deficit of being outsiders looking in.B Science is overwhelmingly influenced by political correctness. Even the few courageous studies which break PC conventions are then widely denounced upon publication. And since reality is decidedly unPC the meaningful stuff is far less likely to be taken seriously and believed than the bullshit.What supports TRP? The real life experiences of those whove actually lived life.,TheRedPill,ceerla5,4,t5_2ve1u

Again youve missed the point differing culture from race their concepts of being a man are universal in some areas being in shape for instance but also differ based on social aspects some which differ significantly from the western one. Few people outside corporate recruiters in the west give a shit what college you went to  there it can be a big big elevation of status. In fact a lot of those aspects that we in the west deride as being beta traits  the work hard go to a good school then be a provider  are admired there. Do not underestimate the power of those status symbols in those countries. Again those are the cultural aspects of those specific societies.And dont automatically assume those countries are without outside influence just because they are racially homgeneous.

I can see now that his action comes from a different place than I thought it did. He was accepting this monumental risk and did it alone because he could protect and care for his family even after his death by shouldering that responsibility even when nobody would have blamed him if he didnt.

But thats just what TRP means to me.We might not have any control over whether our message gets diluted but in the end the absolute gold that Ive absorbed here will be with me forever.And with spreading TRP outward?Some people can be told not touch a hot stove.

They love me for it but ultimately it doesnt help with any sexual strategy.Edit Just want to add after thinking about it youre right about have a natural knack for passing the shit tests I can be funny rude to women without feeling bad if that makes sense.

145704,0,t1_cev0g9z,I personally wouldnt go after a pity date like that. You should leave it at rejection for both your frame and inner game. It probably isnt good for your esteem if you have to resort to that kind of tactic to get the date on the regular. Besides if you run into the girl later after leaving it as is she will probably view you as higher value because of it. By this time you might have reconsidered giving her another shot.The point being made even in the article is that she isnt going on the date with you because you improved your value shes doing it because she doesnt want to seem like a bitch. That will do little to nothing for your own chances when you actually get on the date. Youre going to start at an attraction deficit compared to other guys in her life as soon as you sit down with her.,TheRedPill,cev0z2y,10,t5_2ve1u

She did it the first night we spent together and I just told her using kind words that that was bullshit. And because I was developing feelings for her I explained to her why did I think it was bullshit.I used to read girls palm in order to nail them reading their past and telling them very profound things about their psyche. One of the things that I ALWAYS included in my reading was this onegt When you were younger maybe a kid or a teenager someone forced you to act as an adult when you werent ready for it pause. Yes I know it was hard long pause but you have to think that everything that have happened to you made you what youre know and if you like yourself you can thank that event for making you who you are.I must have read those lines like to a thousand girls and the vast majority of them could relate to them.I now think that having a sexual encounter too early or what they think was sexual even if it wasnt really sex is something very common to women and most of them doesnt give a shit about it nor it affects their emotional and sexual life.If you find a woman who put forward this argument when she needs it either shes a manipulative bitch or her brain doesnt work properly. Either way distance yourself from her.Or if you too like to live dangerously call her bullshit and keep her around you.

The goal was to give direction to our lives by becoming like our parents grandparents adult people in a functional family. To take our place in the chain of being.As for respect what you say is one possible scenario maybe you are projecting your experiences into others. If a relationship is very sexual to begin with so one of these weird kinds of marriages that are like a hookup and not an adult thing where sex is much less important than doing our duty and providing grandkids for our parents this can happen that it can be a result of resentment and disrespect.Our case is more like everything else having higher priority for me too. If I wanted to have sex I would have never married. What would be the point? As long as a woman is hot enough for you to want to have sex with her she is too dangerous to marry anyway. Once you grow beyond that phase and simply desire being normal like your parents grandparents who takes more joy in planning the baby room than in carnal desires that is marriage time.So in our case it never had anything to do with respect or resentment because we never had that hookup type of weird modern marriage to begin with.

For some reason she gave me the impression that she didnt like me before she even offered me up . . . her left hand!Now I just happened to have heard that in the Muslim world offering the left hand for a handshake is considered an insult so right there in front of three or four people I called her out on it.The look on her face stunned like I had slapped her really hard.She then said Well I was holding a beer in my right hand and it was wet.I replied I dont care.  You put the beer in your left hand and you wipe your right hand off.Didnt get me added to her Facebook but damn did it feel good.Another time I methodically dissected a hambeasts taking of psychiatric medication to help her with her depression . . . yet drinking at a bar even though it was counterindicated both substances having sideeffect of making her fat thus contributing to the misery she was medicating for.  She broke down and started crying at one point I think it was after I suggested that her therapist was only in it for the money.,TheRedPill,cf0s2ir,28,t5_2ve1u

Its pretty asinine because blue pill thinking is where all the Nice Guys come from. Its like running a crappy martial arts school teaching your students really bad ideas like blocking punches with their face and then shaming and mocking all of your students for being really bad at karate.Nice guys try to act nice to attract women because thats all that they were taught to do. Be nice be yourself be confident and always be caring! Its hypocritical for them to shame nice guys for just wanting sex. If every woman that exists on this planet told their boyfriends that sex is no longer an option in the relationship how long do you think their boyfriends will stick around?Oh right its almost as if the boyfriend is also just in it for the sex.,TheRedPill,cf0t2be,3,t5_2ve1u

198507,0,t3_1wd617,gtI think its relevent to the women who lash out RedPill is not only because of ignorance exaggerateddistorted miconceptions or a few distasteful posts of a minority but also becuase they are in denial of some of the truths that hit hard very homeThey would hate to lose their beta orbiters and by proxy their Reddit White Knight workforce. So of course they shun any ideas that elucidate the actuality of the situation. Consequently you dont see them actually critique anything TRP is about rather they set up strawmen and hyperbolized bullshit and attack it on insane grounds. IE They advocate throwing a pregnant woman down a flight of stairs. As a result TRP is considered some sort of insane subreddit and youd have to be insane to come here. Something fundamentally wrong with you. So the detractors prop this banner up and right on money the beta orbiters omegas and White Knight stomp their feet and raise their hands in honor deriding TRP and demonstrating to mlady that they are the special caring kind of guy who gets them.People tend to shatter the mirror that remind them of their ugliness. So if TRP detractors are actualized enough to realize the shit here is often truth they shun it because they dont want to believe that they function along simple biological paths heavily influenced by evolutionary trends. They want to maintain the importance of their free will and how they are special little butterflies and deserve to have their asses kissed. If they lack that actualization they simply see it is some sort of lunacy because it opposes their Statusquo and stands antithetical to the spoonfed Disney bullshit that love triumphs all and that by being a pushover youll eventually get the lady.

238255,0,t1_cf5eg0r,I am sorry but I do have to disagree with you. I know TRP advocates strongly that this is one of the reasons that men fail with women but I dont believe it is the reason in my case. Ive never been a doormat. Ive never had a problem with people using me. In fact my problem has been some what opposite. I can get very emotional when a person mistreats me even in the slightest ways and I am prone to telling them off quickly in very detailed ways. Ive been actually working in being less angry in this sense. I think the problem is that my behaviors and body language seem to be more accommodating than they actually are. What seems to happen is that I lack the confident appeal of someone alpha and at the same time the super accommodating nature of beta. So I believe people think of me generally as someone that can be pushed over but when they find out I am not they are off put and add on top of that the lack of alpha appeal and there is nothing for them to get from me either way so they just become indifferent and see no reason to interact with me. And I think indifferent is how most people feel about me.To answer your specific questions Im not sure Ive ever done those in the most explicit ways simply because Ive never had the opportunity. Ive never really had a girl like me and need to reject her. What usually happens in that vein is I may sense someone is somewhat interested at first and if I dont like them I generally just pretend to not realize they are flirting or interested. The girl gets tired and generally stops soon after. So I avoid hurting her feelings and she is no longer pursuing me. Its a win win. I would reject an attractive girl with a bad personality. Perhaps not a few years ago but I would now. I have told attractive girls in the past what I disapprove about them or just stopped talking to them because of the way they were treating me. I always try to be kind though which I think goes back to me seeming less firm than I am. Though Ive noticed that by being a bit softer in some ways I get people to like me more in a genuine respectful and fair way.I wouldnt say I am a master at maintaining frame but I genuinely believe I am better than the average bloke. I have lapses and moments of desperation like writing this story and weakness like any human but I think by and large I have had integrity to my beliefs in dealing with people. So maybe people are leading me to the water but maybe my problem isnt thirst to extend the metaphor. Im trying to find out what the problem is though. ,TheRedPill,cf5g1ov,1,t5_2ve1u

There are many frames to be had.ltYou should expect women to want you.  It should be a given that a woman wants you.  That is the frame you get pussy with.gtIf that is true then obviously that behavior will continue into a relationship of any sort. And since my problem is relationships with women not women as coworkers or friends or classmates I think it makes sense to talk about romance and in that have ideas about the nature of women included.ltI think youre are using romance and getting women want to fuck you interchangably.  That may be why we are having difficulty communicating.  Women are emotional beings.  They are generally not selfaware....aka they dont know what they want.  They generally let life happen to them.  You have to be mindful of this while chasing women and in an LTR with women.  If you know that women let life happen to them then that means that you know that you can put yourself in the drivers seat by your own force of will.  Women want to be driven.  Drive them.gtI know that. Again I have no idea what you mean about it being a frame problem. I think you are assuming I do because thats what TRP thinks is usually the problem or something like that.ltNo Im telling you its a frame problem because you have a frame problem.  Just by reading your words I can tell that you dont think youre worthy of a woman.  You have the gender on a pedestal.  Just imagine theyre a female version Tom Hanks from Big and a little girl was placed in the body of a chick.  Theyre nothing special.  I get depressed sometimes now when I realize just how shallow many women are.gtIsnt anyone who is totally rational the same? Isnt being selfish and Machiavellian a kind of rational thing?ltExactly. When a man acts rationally its to be expected.  When a woman acts rationally its going against her normal way of thinking.  Remember they follow their feelings.  Thats why you need to watch out.  They will default back to their feelings at the first chance they get.  AKA leave your beta ass for some alpha cock.Bro I gotta work but heres my advice for you....some of it is cliche hit the gym approach women read TRP improve yourself learn a language martial art sport go back to school dont obsess over women dont get in an LTR for a long fucking time....spin plates,TheRedPill,cf7p3ru,1,t5_2ve1u

She is aware of whats happening she is aware youve tried to sleep with her. She knows you want the poon and she is aware that she is denying it to you.My immediate suggestion is cut ties with her. In the event that you dont want to cut ties with her then remove her from the pedestal. Start seeing other girls. Make sure she knows youre seeing other women as well. Talk about them show her pics of other girls on your phone. Focus on letting this bird brain that she isnt the only monkey in the jungle. Another thing id like to tell you is  make sure that next time she says I love you to you stop her dead in her tracks. Let her know that love is not a one way avenue.

265600,0,t1_cf8312c,Im not going to disagree with you on the motives women have for getting married. Im sure a lot of them do get married because its expected of them in the same way men have expectations upon them.The problem is that if the relationship does not work we all know who will be worse off than before he got into it. We men are bitter because when a divorce is engaged  we are blamed for working so hard to provide a good living to our wives and children i.e. she deserves alimony because YOU made her stay homeearn less. Note that all the time we spent at work instead of doing what we wanted to do or spend time with our children is never taken into consideration. we have to continue to provide for our ex and our children a standard of living equivalent to the one they already had even when it makes it impossible for us to have a decent standard of living afterwards. Most guys probably have nothing against the basic concept of child support only that the amounts are insane at the moment. we are expected to not complain and start a new relationship again with another woman if we have enough money still maybe have more kids all the while paying child support and alimony to our ex. we see our ex using our children as pawns to obtain child support defacto alimony. She will live with her new boyfriend both will work and their combined income will probably far surpass yours and the law will never take this into consideration. visitation rights are never enforced. we know deep down in our hearts most women would give away their children to the father if it was the only way for them to get alimony.,TheRedPill,cf8afea,5,t5_2ve1u

They had fun passed jokes. She tried to pickup girls and was surprised to see what a man has to go through just to get a number. Or how no women would give a second look to guys.

296684,0,t3_1xhqrj,There are two fallacies in this argument . That logic was an invention. . That it was invented for the purpose of arguing with women.Logic wasnt invented. Its an ability that evolved in the human species and was culturally developed and is now the basis of the modern world. Science technology and law are all based on logic. Without the ability for high levels of logical thought the human race wouldnt have evolved beyond being just another smart ape. The reason that women hate logic is not because they are incapable of it  I believe they have the capacity for it  its because their emotional drives are so much stronger than their ability to reason. If youve ever argued with a woman and maintained your frame you will have seen the recognition of your logic in her eyes. Shortly followed by confusion caused by the cognitive dissonance of the logical part of her brain being overwhelmed by the emotional part. Or you may have had the experience of convincing a woman of your view point using calm logical reasoning only to have her completely regress to her emotional view at a later date.

You didnt have to go through his High School Yearbook and find out if he had been one of the  natural who get all this stuff naturally you didnt interview all his exgirlfriends to see if he had ever had his heart broken and learned from it you didnt question what mentors male influences or writers had shaped his views he acted and you reacted. gtHigherquality women  the ones you would actually want for LTRs are more discriminating. They can see through game and windowdressing.What is window dressing about busting your ass in the gym and making yourself a stronger person mentally and physically?

311185,0,t1_cfd0jj5,I dont know why exactly. But this is how I perceive it. If I say it beforehand its no longer natural and it feels forced like a chore like something we have to do. It doesnt only put pressure on her but also on me and I hate it. Its like that anticipation that now we must do it because I said it. It should never resort to must but should always be want. And the second I said that she wasnt in the mood while I was and for her it was a must instead of a want. I dont know if my words make sense but thats how I view it. Lets put it this way. Sex should not be rationalized it should only be felt driven by emotions and arousal. When that arousal is not there in the moment saying that you want sex sounds and feels like shit to her. Thats why I always pursue a fake natural approach to sex where it just happens like magic hamstering logic using several techniques which I ignored in this interaction for fuck knows why... maybe I was too horny.

This is a result in the differences in educational levels as well as womens and governments mutual preference for each other. The result in couples living together means that men dont give women control over their money because there isnt a common household budget anymore. This means advertising has to start targeting men directly and not byproxy though women. The consequence of this is that content has to be maledriven. Thus TV will try and go after us men.

Just reading your post I get a really blue pill vibe. Dont get me wrong glad youre here best of luck etc. etc but youre still plugged in. Youre still trying to lean on her for strength. This will not work. You need to be the source of your own strength. When you get there shell respect you more. Think about it your attractiveness as a man is based largely on your strength mental and physical when you break that illusion its analogous to a chick showing up  pounds overweight with a bad haircut. I dont care how empathetic you are in that situation you would probably be nonplussed. You might love her still... but all the same you didnt sign up to be with a fat chick with a pixie cut. Same for this girl. You showed up mentally weak. Thats not what she signed up for.  Thats not the guy she married. In her mind. Shes making fun of you not because shes evil or whatever but because she needs you to get it.Thing is she cant tell you that. If strength is what youre attracted to you cant just say be a stronger man because the existence of that signal turns it into a contradiction. If youre just being strong to impress her if you need to be told to be strong then youre not really being strong youre being supplicating right? And thats the opposite of strength. So its not really her fault youre acting poorly and its being reflected in her behavior. Its like cesar milan training dogs. If a dog is acting out its not usually the dog its the owner.

347683,0,t3_1y0l0d,I actually started processing this question about a week ago when I saw this Lifetime original movie dont judge me The girl I met online.They paint her actions like shes a psychopath but the reality is these are behaviors that Ive seen in more women than not.  Her stats  years old no education beyond high school lives at home with her mom.  ShopliftsAnecdote serious ex gf turned out to be serial shoplifter. Shoplifting clothes from the mall with her best friend on the weekends. I didnt find out about this until she was arrested and needed my help.   Shops for guys online by pay grade instead of who they are is doing this while at work instead of doing her job My two cents this is par for the course.  Physically assaults ex boyfriend for an indiscretion then blames the resulting financial legal mess it brings her for her current life lives with her mom and is of little means also constantly  berating her mom for their living conditions. anecdote I have been bitten pinched punched in and about the face pushed attacked with knives scissors shoes various knickknackery and all manner of tchotchke had my tires deflated my rear view mirror torn off shirts torn at the neck one pair of shorts slashed down the leg with an   Exacto knife while wearing them and while driving having a testicle squeezed and other less memorable incidents. I would also like to note this was in my more passive bp days. Further every incident was one sided. Occurring while I slept while on the toilet driving multiple times while playing video games while walking away while accepting a break up with a shrug her dont ever come back here! I stop turn and shrugI wasnt planning to then continue walking only to find my self embroiled in ashirt pulled over headhockey fight. And this young lady was private schooled. Oh and this gem Dropping gf off decided to break it off because she was proving to be a shitstain on my soul.  Tell her as much and to have a nice life. She gets behind my car so I cant exit the drive. I promptly call the police. She tries to wrest the phone from me and tell her version of events. When she is unable she nearly bites my nipple off thru my shirt. I strike her reflexively that bite was in the top five of most painful experiences of my life and has left a nasty and disfiguring scar in a very sensitive place and she pulls out her phone to call the police no longer interested in keeping me there. I leave but am pulled over and arrested six blocks from my home.  Vandalizes another ex boyfriends home while hes at work because he said they should go their separate ways. She pours water in the hifi throws cologne bottles in the toilet cuts up clothing and spray paints art pieces and furniture When confronted she says she was emotionally abused.  Lies about her station to the man shes trying to lure claims to be a business manager for a doctor is actually a secretary and fucking her boss for the use of a car she pretends to own also uses her sisters nicer home to get picked up at by men so they dont see that shes actually a peasant   Fakes sudden illness to draw her man away from his circle of friends. Anecdote Ive seen this happen several times to others  The entire time she is hostile towards anyone she feels is threatening her winning ticket that this new love interest represents her mom for wanting to meet him  because it would reveal her actual lifestyle the shopkeeper who confronts her for shoplifting her new beaus sister for catching her at a hotel with her boss.

422072,0,t1_cfoif6l,Youre going to find that this is incorrect within our framework please reread the sidebar.Edit Read gtThe problem that confounds hypergamy is that the arousing Alpha and the attractive Beta rarely exist in the same male at the same time and at the most opportune time for women to appreciate and capitalize on it. By this I mean that as women proceed through their peak SMV years they place higher priorities and higher mating value upon predominately Alpha traits. These are the fuck me now party years and Alpha seed far outvalues Beta need. As I wrote in Schedules of Mating on a macro level this translates into a proactive form of cuckoldry. Even if it doesnt result in a pregnancy the latent urgency in a womans peak is to get the seed first find the provider later i.e. protracted cuckoldry.gtThe fantasy for women of course is to tame the savage Alpha and convert him into a parentally invested partner by encouraging Beta traits in him as he matures and hopefully prospers. Many a thwarted single mommy knows the unfortunate outcome of attempting to fix their Bad Boy Alpha into the Good Dad Father but this is the emphasis assuming a woman pauses long enough to invest in one particular Alpha during her peak years. The base schema is to maintain that hot Alpha arousal while developing him into a more attractive Beta provider.,TheRedPill,cfoihao,3,t5_2ve1u

Theyre basically racing to conform to an ideal set by other people.Ive been shaving my head for awhile now.  I save money on going to the barber.  I do this because I know people with gray thinning hair are judged to be unattractive but not because I think look particularly unattractive with gray thinning hair.  I could have taken Propecia and colored my hair but I refuse to put any chemicals on my body to pollute it for the sake of pleasing shallow cunts.Another thing to remember plenty of women are turned on by bald men.  They actually like it.Just work out stay fit stop taking that crap shave your head and act like you dont give a fuck.

This too gives her an edge in verbal combat.  From my experience the best way to handle this is to ignore the  missiles only  or  of them should be taken seriously assuming this is a longterm relationship you actually care about otherwise dont bother.  If you try to defend against each one youre in for a long sleepless and fruitless night.  When I see those  missiles coming my way for the  that are bullshit I just listen and ignore.  I never discuss them.  I dont defend myself against them because they arent worth my time and to defend means I have to discussI dont discuss I just ignore.  I do listen though so she feels shes being heard and not simply dismissed again assuming this is a longterm relationship.  Also a line of questioning so invasive so interrogative and so unreasonable that a man feeling like he is on the defense will yield his logic.

554390,0,t1_cg39vag,Sorry my comment was a bit harsh and reactionary.  Saying less can work in your favor especially if you have a tendency to be verbose.  I know this from experience because Ive been oververbose and it has turned people off.  I just dont want to see people take this too literally and think they have to keep their mouths shut.  It just smacks to much of a stifling of free expression.  Can you imagine how women would react if you told them theyd be more attractive if they kept their mouths shut?  Why would we want to encourage men to be silent on here?  When I was verbose I had the mistaken impression that it would make more charming or interesting and that this would make me attractive.  Instead I came off as a boor or a bore.  One of things I learned from a period of depression was the power of silence not talking too much and listening more.  I learned a lot.  I learned to ask people questions about themselves.  Obviously there needs to be a balance but some people read stuff like this and think Oh I should never say anything because it might get me unlaid.

People want different things and opening up to one another takes time and work  more often than not you wont fully understand what your partner wants in a given situation and viceversa. Talking about such things is productive. It is absolutely true that some women will use conversation as a euphemism for lets talk about what I want. But this is conditional. Myself Im a very talkative and sharp guy and conversation is my element. I dont lose debate. Unsurprisingly I have never had a longterm partner pull the conversation card  instead shell bring up her emotions and feelings if she wants a little dose of relationship power because I obviously have no direct control over those things.And thats the rub sometimes partners want more control.

611098,0,t1_cg9q33u,Until  years ago almost all wars where fought by mercenaries men whose primary purpose for fighting was monetary. A warriors equipment was expensive so you needed a highly trained warrior. The exception are warriors like bowmen and slingers. Every bowmen usually made his own bow it was not complicated. But it required  to  years of training to use effectively. A British bowman could draw a lb plus bow behind his ear. Try and lift  pounds with your finger tips. Firearms are not as effective as bows but anyone could be trained how to use a musket in a few weeks. Bows unlike muskets are silent and and do not produce smoke. They also have a higher rate of fire.The industrial revolution allowed massive amounts of weapons to be produced at a low cost. So having a large army was just the cost of the weapon which was cheap. Mercenaries where expensive governments figured out with cheap weapons that quantity is better then quality.You can find this sort of accounts of shaming as early as the Napoleonic wars. There are accounts of this happening in the US civil war etc. Women are generally speaking very blood thirsty when they face no personal risk. And they rarely respect their enemy. During WW is German or British bomber crews had to bailout if the military did not get to the bomber crews first usually women would beat them to death with shovels. During all wars women would always encourage men to get war trophies as in ears skulls etc of the enemy. This occured even with the US against the Japs during WW. A true warrior respects his enemy. That does not mean you agree with his beliefs etc. but respect of his abilities.

626794,0,t3_219u5q,Exceptional post.  War Brides also explains some of this purely solopsistic biochemical behavior.  Women are simply programmed to bond to whoever is fucking them the hardest at the time.Carousal riders have less ability to strongly pair bond and are more likely to decide Im not haaaaaapppy later.  The more Alpha cocks in their past the less they can pair bond permanently with their new man.  This is why so many advocate only virgins for LTRs and why virginity was such a big deal for all of human history until oh about  years ago.  More lies from the Matrix.OP is entirely correct this is from the Oxytocin rush following sex.Note this process is incredibly breathtakingly fast.  A man may pine for years over a woman.  A woman will pine until she gets the Oxytocin rush from somebody else and then she will swing with hardly a tear or a micron of sympathy for the man she promised to love forever.

648035,0,t1_cgdv0oy,While feminism does allow for women to show their dissatisfaction with cooking it has also made them ignorant about it because they consider it a gender role instead of a selfsustaining skill. I agree with you that taboo might not be the right word for woman not cooking but you have to admit that less and less girls know or are trying to learn how to cook. You may be right that the pursuit of the American dream and Fast Food joints might take away the capability and need of learning how to cook but cooking is something that everybody should try to do. Even on the busiest of days there is still time to cook something. If not then on the day that is not the busiest people can do what bodybuilders do and make food for the whole week put that shit on tupperwares and store in the fridge.

Most logical paradoxes are known to be invalid arguments but are still valuable in promoting critical thinkingSubsitute the word women for human behaviour. The difference is men and women generally speaking operate on a difference set of paradoxes. A paradox indicates that the theory is flawed in certain areas. But a flawed theory can still be useful if it is correct in the majority of the cases.The best example of a paradox is light. Is light a wave or a particle ? Originally light was thought to be a particle the particle theory explains why light bounces off mirrors etc. But the particle theory failed in certain areas like defraction and when it travels through different medium. So the best explanation is light is a wave. But then as wave this theory will not explain certain experiments in this case it is acting like a particle.The best explanation is light is niether a particle or a wave and it indicates lack of understanding.There are some threads which are attempting to expand things.,TheRedPill,cge0u3c,2,t5_2ve1u

Ill admit that I am a beta although I was major alpha until about  when I developed PTSD. I used to have crowds of hot women begging me to date them and that is no lie or exaggerationa natural without knowing anything about alphabeta.

665014,0,t1_cgflh8n,Spin? Its actually more about tapping into desires and insecurities and building a story that resonates.People buy symbolism and props to confirm who they are... They buy to demonstrate the values and personality traits that they deem valuable. They align themselves with brands and products that are positioned around values BMW for performance Volvo for safety etc. reflective of who they believe themselves to be and who they aspire to be. A woman buys yoga clothing from Lululemon not just for functional yoga wear. She may never join a yoga class. Her purchase supports her sense of being fit hip stylish sophisticated and part of the IN crowd... Whatever human values that particular brand has come to represent.She could also go buy similar noname gear at a cheaper price that offers the same functional benefit. But the logo on the clothing is a symbol that carries meaning. The symbol becomes an important part of affirming who she is as a person and can signify membership within an exclusive group. People want to belong to the cool kids club or the savethewhales team or whatever. And they want to be seen wearingdrivingowning the appropriate symbols that signify membership. Nike Apple Toms Shoes... the list is endless. This ability to flaunt a message of belonging and to confirm status to others is a major appeal of brand names. That brand piece becomes a key prop in a storyline that you broadcast to everyone you meet... Your clothing your jewelry your car all silently announce to everyone who you are and what you value.

672635,0,t3_21t898,She lays down a ton of words without writing a substantial argument anywhere in her needlessly lengthy diatribe.  Her entire essay is an emotional outburst without one lick of intellectual discourse.  Look at her opening counterpointgtThis is why liberal dudes were licking it up since it was a purportedly antisexist piece but it still had a soothing message that men still somehow are more than women because they are more alive you know. They have more desire. They really like sex in a way that you women can never understand. gtDo you guys know how offensive this is? Not examples of how its inaccurate pointing out the flaws in the argument not demonstrating anything which could serve as a rebuttal.  No she merely states how shes offended.  Which in a womans world is enough to dictate how reality works apparently.  TRPers know that this is par for the course for feminists.  Feminism and logic are mutually exclusive.Theres an enormous amount of evidence showing how men are innately hornier than women including several examples from the Cracked article.  I could also point to how porn for both heterosexual and homosexual men far eclipse that for women.  Or how there are far more heterohomo men going to strip clubs and seeing prostitutes than women. But the author ignores all that and continues with false indignationgtI appreciate that he agrees men shouldnt hold women responsible for this but still embedded in this is the idea that men and only men have these remarkable will to live to screw to really enjoy life that comes out even in in the face of death. Women certainly arent interesting enough to have inappropriate urges you know. Shes butthurt at losing the horniness competition.  Until she writes past a high school level shes not worth taking seriously.,TheRedPill,cggq8ig,1,t5_2ve1u

722454,0,t1_cglkhkc,Its only that she is worried that you loved someone else more than her.  Youll see a woman especially worried about this if the guy says hes been hurt by a woman.  She knows if you are still hurt by someone then you still think about them.  The hardest part to remember is that falling in love is terrifying for a woman.  The same way that we have an innate fear of investing our time into  trustingopening up to someone and being made a fool or being taken advantage of or breaking that trust by leaving for someone else most women have an extremely high fear of being vulnerable to anyone.  Youll see most women react out with fear or anger when they feel like they are worried they are more invested in the relationship.  It also can come when the relationship is at its end and shes leaving whether its because someone is giving her more affection or the guy is emotionally hollow or how many ever reasons.  I wrote it below a little but what youll usually see is that men are good at being happy if they are doing their discipline or are in their environment whether thats a place or certain people. Those two things comfort a man.  A woman is different in a fundamental way she needs affection first before she can be comfortable.  Thats why shell wonder what youre thinking or why youre doing something or why you havent done something important to you yet because she isnt feeling enough affection from you yet.  I guess its easier to do it this way.   Men Discipline than affection Were psycological first then emotional Women Affection before discipline Needs emotion first to move forwardIts also why men have to lead.  Think about it you will always follow someone who is discplined better than anyone before youll follow somone who has no disciplline but is loving of everyone.  The leader though is also responsible for everyones needs. He must be disciplined but when hes disciplined then he has to show affection or shell think hes going without her or will leave her or is simply putting up with her.  Im obviously repeating myself so hopefully this all makes sense.  Its kinda weird how suddenly some things click.  Just remember if shes being rude and you know youre doing well then she probably just wants more of your love.  ,TheRedPill,cgmea8a,4,t5_2ve1u

But people who behave in that manner often bend the truth. You will be put into an awkward position where your friendship obligates you to give some amount of trust but you dont actually trust her. For example if she says that someone is a liar would you believe her? Or is she just making up dramatic stories for attention and validation? The white knights would throw the dudes reputation under the bus because she said it.Even if you are socially intelligent enough to navigate through this mess you should not introduce such a person into your social network because you are exposing your friends to this risk too.

Being able to identify shit tests keeping your guard up and ALSO knowing how to play the game are all tools every man should know... and most of these things could also be learnt by women. But make no mistake we are not equals and not acknowledging our differences is simply put stupid and can only lead to getting burnt. Most of us have been burnt at some point for ignoring these differences and because as modern men weve been taught since childhood that we should not only cool down many of our manly features being aggressive competitive but to treat women as if they are inherently more special than us. So in the dating game they already have the upper hand. Marriagedivorce laws are still more beneficial to women the law in general is tougher with men than with women and feminism simply expects men to give women respect for the mere fact that they have a vagina.

760067,0,t1_cgqng40,There is a big difference between what is portrayed as black culture BETWeezyDrakeFuBu and actual innercity black culture. Perhaps its my fault for not specifying. But it is a fact that black urban citizens are predominantly of low SES and poverty and hardship is the genesis of hatred and animosity. Then add in liberal political activists who for years have been instilling indignation into poor black people and guilt into middleclass white people for the sole purpose of getting them to vote democrat and you have a perfect recipe for cultivating racist hatred. I mean hell we even have welleducated professors of African American studies in universities across the country trying to tell people that its ok for black people to hate white people because racism  power  prejudice so because the black community has no power never defined any hatred they express towards whites doesnt count as racism.The really fucked part is that most black people of low SES dont even seem to legitimately hate white people although walk the streets of NYC and you cant help but run into the ones that do. Na most of them seem to act as if they are being pushed and guilted into hating white people by both the aforementioned liberals and the angriest crabs of their own communities. Maybe hate and animosity are even too strong for terms to describe their attitudes but there is a palpable level of distancing observable among inner city blacks when confronted with whites. Im not saying I blame them but Im not going to pretend it doesnt exist. And that attitude understandably makes it really difficult for black women to admit that they are attracted to white men. From what I hear they catch a lot of shit for that. Black men are free to fuck white women because of the power dynamics at play in malefemale sexual relations. If you fuck a white girl youre dominating her. If I fuck a black girl Im dominating her. Our larger communities see both situations as distinctly different. And if you need more proof besides my anecdotal evidence that black chicks are attracted to the top  of white guys just look at those stats floating around on their online dating messages. When they arent surrounded by people who will judge them negatively and shame them they feel free to express their true interests.And white people dont really have culture. Just watch white guys interact with each other in predominantly black spaces. We dont fuckin trust each other and we are not brothers unless we wind up in prison where we have to band up out of necessity. Otherwise its every white guy for himself. I mean just think of how much geographical difference there is between Russia and Ireland. We may have the same skin color and look similar to you but culturally and genetically we are nothing alike. But in America due to backlash against the naziesque racial purists of the early th century white people are publicly discouraged from being proud of our heritage. Im of GermanicIrish descent. My people have a proud and ancient history. But any trace of that culture has long since been stamped out in this country by those who are afraid of a return to white supremacism.

Dante Nero explains this perfectly in his podcast the Beige Philip show. You cant get mad at a fish for swimming. Women will always shit test they will alway look for the better option they will always try to rationalize their ridiculous behavior. You have to accept the women for the creature that they are. Once you can come to terms with what women are and not what they say they are you can start to rationalize why women do what they do. Focusing on yourself is the best move you can make. Of all the shit test a women throws at you nothing will change the fact that youre amazing and you know it. Girls will always try to rationalize why they are special but nothing beats the cold hard facts. You need to put numbers on the boards.,TheRedPill,cgt8df2,2,t5_2ve1u

Coming from one of the top areas in my state for football competition was intense. Teams we played would win state championships.

Why didnt hard work put me at the top of her list?Still who the fuck takes the tweet buy me Starbucks tomorrow and Ill love you forever seriously? Me. Who volunteered to help with projects for hours? Me. Who fixed her car when she needed help she lived down the street? Me. Who made her a birthday card? Me. And then she went to prom with some dick from our rival schools team? And I had to see them grinding while my own date left me in the cold to dance with other guys?No more. I use this experience as a reminder as to why I wont ever see women past sex objects ever again.

I dont think Louis is by any stretch of the imagination dumb like some people  have suggested however. Like most people his rationale is extrapolated from whatever experiences he has had up to that point. Hes always been a loser therefore he cant help being one... might as well enjoy it! Hes a dude that could go in the exact opposite direction. If he taught himself the value of selfdiscipline and brashness. As it stands however he appeals to the jaded soccermom crowd who have had enough of their kids interfering with their lives all the time and the disenfranchised males who have given into sleaze because they rule themselves out of a healthy sexlife.

And finally d the pussy decides alpha is what gets the greatest quantity and quality of girls. All of these behaviorscharacteristics arecan be construed as heuristics or cognitive shortcuts for fitness whatever that means to her limbic system at the timeBeta is NOT simply someone who is not alpha or alpha enough. Beta is its own positive quality. Simply put beta is provisioning behavior. If a man cannot provision he is not beta. Although on this sub many men are derided for being beta this is a false disparagement. A man that cannot provision and is not alpha is ... I dont know an omega? And given that about  of men born NEVER reproduced I would guess that provisioning isnt that common either. Provisioning beta is a GOOD thing. Women are very attracted to rich guys for around  weeks out of their cycle. Women orgasm more more easily and stronger when being sexed by a man she perceives as wealthy. Alpha is called such because it is the FIRST not only priority of a womans reproductive drive. Get the good genes FIRST NEXT or second beta get some provisioning ideally for her find both traitsbehaviors in one man otherwise get the DNA and then find Mr. Nice Guy to help out in exchange for a shot or three at the cervix.,TheRedPill,ch0eqi3,2,t5_2ve1u

851985,0,t3_23tzro,To me swallowing the pill not only means you understand the mechanism but that you accept the biological necessity of it as well. People who display much anger about how women behave havent really swallowed the pill yet. They know its there and they know what it looks like but they havent taken the step.Thats perfectly fine though. Thats why they and we are here in this subreddit  to make the transition easier for people. Neo was hurting all over and he was really scared when he woke up. Anger is pretty much the most natural reaction and of course we see a lot of that because those who transcend anger dont really need us any more. Those who stay do it to help the rest of us.I used to dream about a woman that I could hold to the highest standards and demand as much of as I do of myself. One of the hardest things Ive done is let go of that idea but once I do the struggle is still daily the relief is immense.A new problem is that the woman in my life knows. She senses Ive stopped holding her to that standard and it pains her even though she knows fully well I was never satisfied. ,TheRedPill,ch14j1h,1,t5_2ve1u

857038,0,t3_23xxsu,He was blue pill. Rather he was an idealist. He had a view of what marriage should be and I grew up in a very traditional household stay at home mom. It wasnt because he lead her that way but because both him and my mom wanted me to be raised how they saw fit and made the decision together.However after I was a bit more grown up he had a health scare and realized that he wasnt in as ideal of a marriage as he wanted. He sort of woke up to some piece of the red pill.He started putting his foot down more and actually calling my mom out on things what werent making him happy.However it was too late by that point after many years in one direction and they ended up getting divorced.Despite me being a young bluepiller who didnt understand he told me that at some point you have to draw a line in the stand and stick by your ideals.But waking up did not last. He spent the rest of his life searching for that ideal relationship vision and I dont think he was never truly happy with his own life.He saw the red pill. He identified with it. He woke up. But he never got to the acceptance stage and spent too much energy being frustrated and looking for some ideal view.Shameless blogspam What Would My Father ThinkAs an aside I feel many of the newbies and even some more experienced are carrying around a lot of anger and baggage from the redpill being angry frustrated or sad at the world for how it is. You have to move past that stage if you every want to be happy. Life is shorter than you think and dont waste time being angry be strong and tough not angry.Eventually you have to get to a point where TRP frees you. You have to see the world how it is and realize that you know the rules that few do! This is a freeing powerful mentality. You can do whatever the fuck you want. You can be in the top  when it comes to sex. You can have a redpill relationship see uoccamsusernames guide if you want.But knowing what you know you can leave that relationship or platespinning and not have any negative emotions attached to it because you are so confident you can have another! When you truly depedastalize women you can move in and out of plates andor relationships with no fear that you can get another if you want and without needing one you can want one but dont need it. You wont be scared of marriage either because youll realize that spending  on the top law firm to get an ironclad prenup is a worthy investment and youll also be confident that you can lead the relationshipmarriage in the direction you want.Dont be an idealist redpill like my father because one day youll be dead and realize you spent your life chasing a unicorn relationship view which is time better spent figuring out how to make yourself happy in the given world.We are rtheredpill not rmensrights and we thrive in this world we dont try to change it.,TheRedPill,ch1p7sa,1,t5_2ve1u
858054,0,t3_23x9fo,In a LTR you NEED to communicate and talk. Not everything is bullshit drama sometimes women just like men need to vent. If youre not going to listen to this even if its just kinda tuning out and saying oh! or uh huh every so often women are going to feel emotionally distant. Sure the sex may be great but women need to feel comfortable and respected to a degree. Its not putting them on a pedestal its the Captain First Mate model. Sure youre the captain but you need to treat her like the first mate. If she has concerns LISTEN to them. You dont need to act on them but listen and discuss. There is nothing wrong with talking about someones concerns. Sometimes their advice will be good sometimes not. But dont be ashamed to admit when theyre right.

921661,0,t3_24o6g1,I find that theres a lot of misconception here about frame and weakness. Theres a huge difference in a womans eyes between being weak and a moment of weakness. Moments of weakness are very acceptable to women. It is OK for these to happen on occasion. Things like a loved pet dying. A loved one dying. Youloved one being diagnosed with an illness. Emotionally charged situations yes on occasion its ok to shed a tear or get choked up by a movie. These are MOMENTS of weakness. They let women know that while youre a strong man but are also capable of empathy. Being weak is very different. Youre constantly complaining. You get mad at the slightest infraction. Youre constantly crying in front of her. Youre constantly sad. Its pretty much just negatives that are continuous instead of occasional. You are allowed times of weakness especially when you are alone. You do not need to keep everything bottled up all the time. ,TheRedPill,ch91rhh,3,t5_2ve1u

Extreme feminism demonizes what is traditionally seen as feminine and its so sad. Its now looked down upon by young people to want to be an ideal housewife. With all this talk about allowing women to choose their own paths you have to let some people choose to stick to tradition. As long as its not harming another person it should be fine. Now its almost a point of pride that young women cant cook sew dress themselves dont wear makeup or dresses etc etc. We are demonizing the traditionally feminine and that is as harmful as blatant misogyny. Also the radfems are the ones who have no concern for legitimate mens issues. Its a problem when men are taken to the cleaners in divorces they didnt want then get a prenup is what some say...victim blaming much? and people assume they are pedophiles for liking kids. The fact that male teachers have to constantly be on edge for stupid teen girls crying wolfrape often because the teacher WONT give them the attention they want and turn them down or when its completely fabricated and they havent even spoken to the teacher is sickening and it hurts the real victims of rape on top of it all!Thanks for understanding and keeping an open mind.

Yeah sure there are plenty of stories of women acting like that but the planet has  billion or so people on it so of course you can find enough examples to justify any view. Look at everyone as an individual and judge them based on that you will be surprised at the results.  I have never been shocked at someones actions once I have gotten to know them.  For examples partners who cheat every single time that has happened I wasnt surprised as I could already tell they were capable of that.  People need to choose their partners better rather than crying when something that most people could see happening occurs.The mentality that TRP has unlocked some supreme understanding of women is just laughable.  You could ask the most beta of betas what women are looking for in a partner and they will most likely answer confident fit and successful.

They generally think they are above sports and think they are far too cool for them to the point where they are insufferable to talk to.  Having played football soccer baseball and basketball as a kid growing up I can easily say that most former jocks watch sports.  Why?  Because they like watching incredible feats of athleticism and can appreciate the hard work that goes into becoming that good and dont really feel intimidated by them.  Not surprising that this view would be espoused on a nerdy website like Reddit though.  Go to any college football message board to see the difference in mentality from this place.

Entitlement mentality is one of the first things that need to be abandoned when taking the red pill. It teaches that money success power is not going to magically fall into your lap. It teaches that you are nothing specials and that if you want attention you have to earn it through strategy and work.If you want physical attention TRP teaches you to work out and do something about it instead of just whining like Elliot did.TRP is about self improvement and the realization that you as a man are nothing special if you want to be special you have to work for it. All Elliot did was play videogames play the lottery and waste his life and parents money. Had he discovered this subreddit I highly doubt that this tragedy would have happened in the first place.

A woman can get away with it and plenty of other women LOVE playing the Rescuer role. But whenever a man whines like this he loses all respect.  . Dodging.

1187606,0,t3_27pep3,This happed about two months into taking the Red Pill otherwise I would have said nothing.  So the family and I are at XX amusement park in line for a ride which takes about twenty people at a time. We had cycled through the line two times and were at the very front.  A woman and her child walks though the line to the front and stands by my family. She asks my daughter a question and then resumes talking to her child just standing there. So she had just cut in front of  people. We have to wait about  minutes for the ride to finish so I wait till the last people are exiting the ride. I then ask her in a loud voice if she knew this was a line and she had just cut to the front??  She starts going on about how she is not cutting just looking at something. I tell her how it does not matter to me I am getting on the ride I literally point back to about the twentieth person who is now looking at us while stating those are the people who have to wait longer not me the ride is now vacated and the family and I walk to it. I could still hear the woman in the back ground at the gate stating how she was not cutting as everyone walked by her.. It wasnt much but it was IRL and I had done something seemingly Alpha.

The fact that women have a weaker sex drive than men and tend to use sex as a currency to buy commitment doesnt mean that they dont like it per se. If the guy is right they actually love it otherwise they would probably be a lot more prudent when it comes to granting sexual favors  its just that most of them arent that much into giving sex but not getting commitment. Ill try it with a comparison Nice GuysTM give commitment but dont get sex. These poor schlubs actually want to be in a committed relationship that includes intimacy and of course sex and dont just see commitment as a means to an end. In fact I guess many actually want to worship their GF and dont just do it out of fear of losing her if they dont. However when they give commitment but receive nothing in return theyre left frustrated feminists of course spin this in a way that theyre the bad guys by insinuating that it was all about sex since no man can be capable of romanticism without a hidden agenda.,TheRedPill,ci3ajtz,14,t5_2ve1u

Money is running out and your lifestyle has to shift downward to match.gtNow theres no way for you to make that kind of money so your only hope is fervently wishing theres another trust fund secretly stashed away for when you turn  or .gtThats the thing about looks  they are a depreciating asset and theres nothing you can do about it. Only bandaids and temporary measures to prolong the downward slide.gtFor a woman the amount she can improve her appearance is like a trust fund kid working at McDonalds for spending money. It doesnt even touch the principal.gtHer genes stick her with an absolute ceiling and that ceiling slowly falls every day.gtMen on the other hand get to make MORE money and increase their standing power fame success you name it.gtFor men the advantage comes in EMBRACING reality. Theres no hard ceiling determined by nature.gtBlue pill males are the ones rejecting reality thinking SHES THE ONE and things can only get worse without her.gtFeminism has offloaded the female false reality onto unsuspecting males as a burden that they dont even know they dont have to carry. They are dragging a cross on their back that they can dump onto the dust at any point. They dont even realize that they dont have to carry it all the way until theyre strung up and nailed to Holy Matrimony by the state.gtWomen just luck into a winning lottery ticket when they turn  without having to have done anything for it so they dont understand why good fortune doesnt just keep falling out of the sky and landing on them.However note that the SMV maturation curve for ugly women and beautiful women is very different.Ugly womens SMV curve is the absolute worst among everybody because they are invisible during their teens and s AND THEN THEY HIT THE WALL. Its a FLATLINE rather than a curve. This is why they really need to get plastic surgery and go to the gym so they can be competitive.Mother Nature gave men a pretty good deal  blue pill brainwashing notwithstanding.The disadvantage a beautiful woman has compared to a man is that she usually never experiences the pain and determination it takes for the average man to climb the SMV ladder without Godgiven talent or good looks.

All of those people I know that were overweight in high school were overweight because they were lacking proper support systems parents who ate poorly and did not exercise emotional issues from childhood that were never dealt with. If someone loses weight for attention from others and not in order to improve their selfimage then it would make sense that they might treat those who were rude to them poorly. If they lose weight for their self then surely they would not harbor hatred for anyone because they achieved their goal out of love selflove. ,TheRedPill,cidj335,1,t5_2ve1u

1300372,1,t3_28yo8l,I should also mention the voice pattern used by the women in these meetings.  Its definitely a higher more shrill octave than normal female voice.  I would love to put the audio on an oscilloscope and isolate the specific frequencies being used. I can almost visualize the vocal chords vibrating at high pitch almost like the highpitched whine of a mosquito or insect.  I often hear the exact same vocal pattern when I hear little children begging their parents to buy them a toy or ice cream at the store.It also reminds me of the control voice used by the BeneGesserit witches in Frank Herberts Dune trilogy.  These witches modulate their speech patterns and intonation in order to command others to carry out their bidding.  what is thy bidding my master.    Basically if you arent immune to their bossy voice you will find yourself complying or going insane trying to resist their shrill high pitched whiny voice.   Same with parents eventually they cave in and buy the ice cream because the alternative is too awful listening to the whiny voices ad naseum.TLDR  Women in positions of authority  use whiny vocal patterns to instruct their subordinates or  drive them insane.,TheRedPill,cifwpvz,0,t5_2ve1u

I have since decided to open up my mind and ask questions since it isnt fair to judge a group based only on what others say about them. Especially on reddit where groupthink seems to be the trend. also I mean honestly I get what youre saying. And.... I mean Ive been told I have the aura of a succubus. So its something Ive learned to live with. I try to put out signals that say taken at every turn but I would judge myself as someone of high SMV with incredibly dorktastic personality traits. I honestly think even though I try to put out the taken vibe I always seem approachable. So men persist because of that openness to me. Its not something I can really change about myself so its something Ive just personally learned to live with. It doesnt make it less uncomfortable. The men also dont have to be people of lower SMV. For example an incredibly attractive doctor asked me out....while I was getting blood work done for a miscarriage. Super awkward. I dont know if this has much relevance since its anecdotal evidence but its just an example.

1305294,0,t1_cifcptb,The story of the woman at the well exists in the Byzantine tradition dating back at least as far as the th century probably further  lots of fragments still exist. The scribal tradition of Byzantine monks was heavily influenced by their Jewish predecessors evidenced by the startling correlation between the oldest preserved manuscripts and the more recent Greek texts. They would almost certainly have noticed and eradicated a new story.Further the text fits stylistically and thematically with the Gospel of John indicating the probability that the content is original.The reason it is called into question is that the  earliest texts do not contain these passages. Considering that they came into existence in areas filled with Gnostics and false prophets and that these texts were not referenced for centuries DESPITE the fact that they were known to exist it is quite likely that these sources are more questionable. Fun Fact the lost gospels were known to be written by Gnostics hundreds of years after the death of the Christ. This is why they were not included in the BibleJust my two cents on the offtopic.PS. The Apocrypha have been carried by the Jewish faith for millenia but they have never been considered as Scripture by the Jewish faith.

The issue lies with as you said firms suffering losses if it becomes particularly weak. This is how so many relationships play out with men getting screwed in the beta bux paradigm. the problem is a disproportionate power dynamic between men and women in LTRs and especially marriages. In divorce women come out on top across the board but men often have to stay unhappy because the consequences of separation are catastrophic. This is inefficient.

Easy just send some men to save them problem solved. Reality next to impossible. Liberal ideas are like this. They sound so nice and feel goody but at the end of the day there is no substance and those men are dead. Pandering.As for that graph. It shows the basic correlation between birth and feminism. This has been discussed a bit. Its a very solid assumption that women would rather only give birth once than multiple times and an organization that tries to empower women would help towards those ends. The basic points Im making can be seen by wikibirth control. The economist Thomas Malthus argued in An Essay on the Principle of Population  that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress. Malthusians were in favour of limiting population growth and began actively promoting birth control through a variety of groups. The term voluntary motherhood was coined by feminists in the s as a political critique of involuntary motherhood and as expressing a desire for womens emancipation.Anyway. I think you have a good track with your ideas but you need more research and backup material to find the real answers you want. Honestly... you probably wont have much fun that route and could get more by lifting and simply having more social interactions. What Im saying is that even though I can look smart telling you all this shit at the end of the day it doesnt give me shit. This is just who I am as very well rounded individual and I excel at detailed research.  Until theres a dire reason for people to have babies most people wont have as many as they used to. Women want to be selfish and have the most fun and excitement they can while theyre young. Respect by old people is nothing compared to a night of well earned shame and fun for most of these hoes.

1333744,0,t3_29cpy5,gt The goal of feminism is to make a society where men and women are as Equal as possible.Why do people keep saying this? This is not nor ever was the intention of feminists. See e.g.The author quotes from the Declaration of Sentiments from the Seneca Falls convention and observesgt The resolutions quoted above make it clear that firstwave feminism was not entirely or even primarily an equal rights  movement. Although an equal right to vote was part of the platform the ultimate objective seems to have been to ensure womens primacy in the law not mere equality. Hence the resolution quoted above that the obligation of the law to make women happy was superior not merely equal to all others. The declaration that asserted that custody should always be decided in a way that makes a woman happy was contrary to the judicially developed principle that the custody of children should be decided solely on the basis of a determination of what was in a childs best interests.gt Taken together with the resolution that the superior obligation of the law was to ensure the happiness of women it is clear that the prevailing belief among these early feminists was that judges when making custody decisions should dedicate themselves to making women happy not protecting childrens best interests. That would be consistent with Stantons supremacist views about women and men. According to her We Women are as a sex infinitely superior to men and if we were free and developed healthy in body and mind as we should be under natural conditions our motherhood would be our glory. gt Feminists made no effort to extend the maleonly childsupport obligation to women. Rather they were committed to advancing and promoting sexbased stereotypes according to which womens naturally superior and proper role was that of childraiser while mens only legitimate function was to provide material sustenance for women and children. This kind of supremacism was congruent with the sexist  judicial philosophies that had spawned the tender years and maternal preference doctrines and it helped cement those doctrines more firmly in the law than they already were.Edit Added some paragraph breaks in the quotation.,TheRedPill,cijnuw7,21,t5_2ve1u

1349256,0,t1_cileudw,gtEquality is a flawed concept because it insinuates both partners have equal skillsets which is not true men and women compliment each other gracefully.True  very true in fact. But to assume women lack the ability to sort out problems and only men can bear the responsibility of power is just as flawed.Here on the Red Pill the better of you address the world in absolutes. People however  and the world  vary drastically depending on who youre speaking to or where you are.The ideal relationship isnt one that abides by the black and white expectations of gender roles but allows both partners to introduce their input and their skills. This is exactly because as you say there is no equality. The man may be better suited to approach some situations and in those times hell take control. But woman are better than their SO in some respects and theyll take lead when the time comes. This way youre leading a healthy caring and productive life with your partner.,TheRedPill,cilf5yj,2,t5_2ve1u
1349631,0,t3_29j3v3,I do capoeira. Not a typical martial art. In fact its really more of a game like sumo in that you enter the ring and dont focus on just wiping the floor with the other guy.It gave me a hell of a lot of body control. Improved my posture. Made me a lot better at reading peoples bodies. Gave me a boost of confidence and discipline. All those combined kinda made me a better dancer as well since I like going salsa dancing. And since its a game I learned to treat life a bit more like a game. I could get knocked down kicked in the chest slip and fall but Ill get up laughing and seeing what I could have done differently and heading straight back into play. Its a bit of joyful stoic mentality. The music in capoeira has messages of win some lose some respect towards the great men who developed all this being cleverwily malandragem or malicia In Portuguese and how even the strongest trees get knocked down but at least a man can get back up. And frankly the physical workout kept me sane in times when life was tough. If your head is tired tiring out the body seems to reset the system.All those things? Yeah it raised it for me. I even had a few girls come try it out and they enjoyed it. It didnt necessarily raise it in the same way lifting would because Im not sure how much physically I developed but more being able to practically use what I had. Im starting to lift more so I can develop further in capoeira. Im gonna look into boxing or BJj or judo soon.Frankly Id say work out and lift but if you take one day a week or two to train a martial art even in place of working out youll still be working out during the sessions probably youll probably feel more like a man than just lifting would. Like sure there are some guys out there who can physically lift more but Muhammad Ali won most of his fights by dancing around the other guy for a while. Spartans won from training and their reliance on each other not necessarily because any one soldier could beat another. Even gladiators were paired in ways that tactics and weaponry was more of a factor than who had the most musclein fact many were fat. Just lifting might make you look and feel better but its nice learning how to use what you get.,TheRedPill,cilgutx,1,t5_2ve1u

You hopefully vet any partner before you commit to them. And if we say that what a TRP man is doing is overcoming his basic instincts then its pretty clear hes going to want a woman who can do the same. But TRP goes farther and so much of the comments in this sub are women arent just unable to control themselves. Theyre effectively children and the current culture encourages this instead of suppressing it like in the past when they knew their place. Theres lots of women WANT to be raped they just dont say it out loud etc. Its silly. Like Im supposed to take advice about female intelligence from some dude who lays drywall or drives a truck for a living?

1395909,0,t1_cir8mdq,Theres a lot of reason Im sure and I know it really had nothing to do with me.  I know that because the last time I saw her she was really happy to see me demanded that I kiss her and hug her when I got there. I cooked her dinner while she worked because I had my life in order and she was working in her thesis.  I love her still and I know she still loves me the way she can probably but its true that love is not a two way street.  I learned that.I also learned relationships are complicated.  Things I learned about them. Never date someone that has no direction.  Without direction they probably wont land in the same spot as you.  My ex was and English major with a German minor .  What are you going to do with that?  Almost nothing.  When push came to shove I think her parents told her she has to get a job because they wont pay for grad school they were cold hearted rich mother fuckers who wanted to retire even though she had to go to grad school if she wanted any kind of future payout with her degree so the only thing she could do is go back to Germany.  She basically abandoned me and when the tables were turned she told me she didnt want me to go to Seattle to work at amazon.  Big slap in the face but a good lesson.. Never be the secret boyfriend.  Her parents didnt know about me  years on because she broke up with me once and came back and never told them.  She said they were the main reason for her leaving the first time since they didnt like me because we got in a fight one time in front of them.  We rarely fought believe it or not.  Who knows though.  I dont really care because I sowed my oats throughout the land in a month.  Anyways This is a big red flag.  I deluded myself into thinking that after all I had done for us she would have the courage to say something eventually to stand up for me.  Wrong.  Women dont have courage in my opinion.  . Notice how her parents are.  They werent good people to say.  Her mom was a cold hearted VP of a huge company like one of the big .  It was like emotions didnt exist to her.  She was also the breadwinner and ran shit in the household.  Felt bad for her dad who seemed like a cool guy just quiet and frustrated probably.  .  If shes rich stop sinking money into the relationship.  Wont impress them. I wish I had spent less on her but I didnt really spend it on her but us.  You know nice dates and shit every so often.  I tried to pay most of the time because after so long I saw a future and wanted to provide for her.  In an LTRmarriage at some point you have to provide.  Dont think you wont have to its not inherently beta unless you do it at the wrong time.  I would say mine was the wrong time I started about  years years in.All in all our relationship was pretty awesome.  I know Im an ill dude because girls always want to date me.  Im not like a hit and drop it kind of guy for girls.  One of my plates has really been pushing for a relationship and Im only gt months out the one I just described.  She had to burn the bridges the way she did scorched earth style because it was a defense mechanism.  I landed in therapy after the breakup before I found the red pill and thats what this guy said because how else can someone turn into this a week after callin someone constantly just to tell them you are Panda Express and see how your day was?  Its ok.  Im  and Im only getting better over time.  Being an adult changes a lot of the game so Im trying to become a master.  My SMV has shot through the roof after gaining  pounds in that time dressing better and starting my own business.  Girls eat that shit up.One day shell regret it.  I will admit most of my actions right now are to ensure she will.  Thats ok for now but Im just waiting for the day when I can honestly say Im doing it for me and not for revenge.  Either way my life has been way better since shes been gone.  That doesnt mean I dont miss her every day or love what we have.  Ill never not remember them fondly.  I just wish that she hadnt put this negativity over our memories.  She had so many times to end it gracefully as I pointed to the future that is insulting to think she played along.  I think deep down I knew though she didnt want anyone else to have me so she held on as long as she could.To think if I had found the red pill sooner.,TheRedPill,cir9atl,2,t5_2ve1u

Thats definitely all changed and you can CLEARLY see the reflection. However thats how pendullums work and we are starting to see it now. On one hand most moderates are begining to dislike feminism because they are seeing it going to far and all this rape culture type hysteria is discrediting them. There is a growing backlash against feminism in general. Not only that but look at how large seduction is growing it started out as an internet forum just  years ago and now its a multibillion dollar industry. However I dont think the taboo roots from women and feminism I really just think its cultural and I think that taboo will be around for a long while at the very least.,TheRedPill,cis35d0,3,t5_2ve1u

1452804,0,t3_2aplsh,Hip hop is full of RP messages because the programs lobbied for by feminists were marketed to and adopted by black communities two decades before they became common in white and middleclass communities.The current wave of singlemotherhood started in the s in black communities when feminists and their lackeys glamorized the strong independent black woman meme while demonizing black men as criminals and deadbeat fathers. This when combined with a massive increase in government programs that offer a financial safetynet to women willing to cut fathers out of families welfare wic food stamps subsidized housing state medical insurance singlemother scholarships affirmative action jobs caused an epidemic of fatherless children and alienated men in black communities.My theory is that white culture and music will increasingly adopt RP points in time but they are already prevalent in hip hop and other black culture because blacks have been under siege by feminist political and social policy for two decades longer.,TheRedPill,ciyduci,1,t5_2ve1u

I was never unattractive or a nolife slob in any way. The important part that redpill taught me is that women only want noncommittal SEX from the top  of men and there is no way of going around this other then getting into that top . Im not reminding myself to have a life. I have a life. Im simply coming to terms with the fact that my life needs to be BETTER top status in every category so that it is attractive to the benefitseeking female mind. Having an okay life doesnt get you sex at beck and call. Being a winner an alpha in every manner gets you sex at beck and call. This is what redpill teaches and you guy have  grasp of even the basics.gt Is that how a friend behaves? Is it friendship to hide your sexual interest? I didnt hide my sexual interest. I had made several advances towards this girl in the past only to be shut down and moved to the friendzone. And while it is  fine that a girl doesnt want anything to do with me the thing that made me angry was that as soon as I displayed what I thought back then to be douchiness she would suddenly turn around completely. Even though they had been feeding me bullshit about how women like nice guys for ages.gt Nobody made you do those things. Nobody told you to do those things. You didnt do them because you are a nice guy you did them because you thought that women owe you sex. No one owes you anything anymore than you owed them those favors.I didnt do them EXPECTING sex as a reward  I thought that it would better their perception of me and hence make it easier to make advances on them. As you can see doing favours for a woman only LOWERS their respect towards you as it shows weakness and submission which are not qualities that women are looking for in a man they want to have sex with.gt Nobody made you do those things. Nobody told you to do those things.Uhh... what ? They DID ask me. Thats how favors work. They would ASK me to drive them around at am and lend them money etc and I would comply being the doormat beta I was expecting them to respect me for being a nice guy.Look dude women arent stupid. Being a nice guy ALWAYS ends up with you being the waterboy for a woman if you dont hold frame. Thats what it naturally leads to even without the girl thinking much of it. This girl knew more than well of my interest in her but seeing as she was extracting value from keeping me as an orbiter she wanted to maintain that state for as long as possible by keeping me in the edge. And there is nothing wrong with this! Its how the female mind works. Its evolutionary psychology. You just need to identify it for what it is and adapt.gt Lending money is not a way to express that interest. Thats friendship and you shouldnt expect anything back.Im not a retard. Of course I knew even then that lending money doesnt show interest. I simply thought it would build me up as a guy who is genuinely nice which I was.Also since when are women not supposed to pay back their debts? Im not talking    for cancer treatment for a kid with broke parents here Im talking rich suburban girls loaning like  for a meal that they AGREED to pay back at some point. Where do you live that lending money equals giving money ? Under a rock perhaps ?gt You dont get to have sex you plain old have sex with people that you express sexual interest to who are also interested.This is absolutely right. Expecting a woman to think better of you because you did things for her is a very toxic mindset indeed. Yet any dipshit can see that it is prevalent in modern western culture and has been for years. And for some reason you give me shit for abandoning that mindset?gt attempts manipulationIn what way is striving to become the top male manipulation ?gt The sad thing and I think the thing people get mad about is that most guys figure that side bar stuff out and implement it just by going about their lives.The thing is I am NOT just going about my life. I am making radical changes RIGHT NOW. Thats what this entire post is about  I have changed my mindset and will change my life. That would be THE OPPOSITE of going about their lives.gt Try to take a step back step away from this echo chamber and think about your attitude towards people in general not just women. Dont use self improvement as a way to bend women to your will or whatever just improve because its good.I dont think you know what an echo chamber is if you think this thread is one. I got great feedback. Also I did that exact thing you suggested  I took a step back and thought about my attitude towards people. And I determined I was wrong and that I wasnt working towards my goals at all. But now I am.I know redpill truths might be a bit cold to swallow at first but its the truth. just rock solid truth and there is no way around it. Redpill doesnt sugarcoat anything or sell you the illusion that Some women are simply bad just keep being a nice guy the right girl is out there for you!. It flat out states that if you dont get laid you are a dipshit. And its your fault. And it gives me a great foundation to build on to become the alpha male that women ACTUALLY want. And once youre there why settle for  ? Why not  or or ? Women will rather share an alpha than have a beta all for themselves this has been proven time and time again. Bending women to your will is simply the welcome side product of becoming the absolute best version of yourself. And thats an awesome message that stomp anything that pussywhipped bluepills like you have to offer.,TheRedPill,cj0rpvg,2,t5_2ve1u

I did keep track on a calendar for proof and it was bad times.  However I dont believe the correct solution is confront wife with meticulously gathered data and graphs.  The correct solution is to start working out improve your diet start going out alone and offer no explanation for your absence etc.  Maybe casually work into dinner conversation how the intern at work or one of the moms at your kids tball practice keeps flirting with you etc.  Make your dissatisfaction apparent increase your own value and then demonstrate subtly that other options are available to you.  If you have done all three of these things your wife will be fucking you constantly. If she still isnt your relationship probably has even bigger problems.,TheRedPill,cj0z8m3,34,t5_2ve1u

She saw that as me being weak and never in charge. I always gave into her whims and she resented me for it. I learned here how to take control back and she immediately responded.The funny thing is that women want a naturally dominant man and men want a naturally submissive woman. Most women suck at being naturally submissive and most men suck at being dominant. Its almost like we project what we want in our partners into ourselves. Men try to appease the woman because they think thats what makes a relationship work and women seek to control because thats what they feel is attractive.I am going to share your post with my wife later on.

This applies not only to women but also male friends work associations etc.  If you are not gaining satisfaction from any interaction there is no point in engaging in it save for altruistic charity.

1522165,0,t3_2blu7c,I am basically one of the newcomers here.  Let me begin by saying that in my nearly  years Ive seen the decline of manhood or at least the manhood I learned from my father happen gradually.  It seems to have hit the point of critical mass though.  There is a marked lack of a transition from child to man in many western cultures.  I am talking about things like ordeals that native american men endure or even natives from central american  tribes as well.  Television commercials are rife with the portrayal of men as bumbling stupid sportsobsessed manchildren.  Now I guess let me chime in a bit.  There seems to be a very vocal set that advocates being a loud obnoxious peacock and call it alpha and I dig where they are coming from but thats not how I like to frame things.  I think there is as much room here for quiet gravitas as there is for firebrands.  I am in no way suggesting anyone moderating their tone herebecause I can respect someone passionately driving their point home with whatever is needed to do so.  Ive done it but these days I identify with the old story of the young bull and the old bull  One day a young bull was standing next to his dad the old bull surveying the pasture below crowded with cows.  The young bull says Hey dad lets run down there and fuck one of those cows  The old bull pauses a second looks semireproachfully at his son and says  No son.

Its usual conditioning random rewards are more efficacious as evidenced by research in gambling addiction.Look up bdsm stuff about organ denial. Teach her to tell you when shes reaching orgasm and keep her on edge from time to time when she orgasm not only will it be much stronger but she wont be able to take it for granted. See in rdeadbedrooms plenty of guys complaining that their low libido wife only wants sex once a month but the seed is great when we do it! Well duh if shes guaranteed an orgasm every time she gets it automatically every time she wants one this its no big deal to her.,TheRedPill,cj7d37j,1,t5_2ve1u

My point is that this doesnt happen in good RP relationships. gt He hadnt met the guy before why should I trust his judgement?Because a man that claims to only be your friend touches you too much. Why wouldnt you tell your friend that they need to mind your boundaries? Why would you let another man be so casual with touching you? gt I have so few friends is something thats really hard to ask of me. . Your friends are more important than your SO. Your ability to say no to your SO is more important than respecting his concernsgt but we havent been dating long enough for me to drop my life and go with him or for him to give up on his dreams for me.How long is long enough for that to be a decision youre comfortable making? If youre aim is to build a lifelong relationship then the only way to do that is to jump in with both feet. Provided you respect trust and love a good man  its not an issue. You have these walls and conditions put in place and they limit your relationship in ways you arent aware of because youre stuck on this equal power thing. If youre happy thats great  and while youre relationship may be many things it certainly doesnt sound RP. ,TheRedPill,cj7rmbd,1,t5_2ve1u

1541651,0,t1_cj9hi8w,Good question actually...OK IRL you are going to meet women of varying stripes and up front you arent going to know these issues exist.You are going to undergo a discovery process when talking with a girl and often that happens when you are out and about in social situations.  As things come to light you make definite judgment calls.A single man needs a release here and there or else hes going to encounter dry spells.  In your pursuit of female companionship you are going to encounter women that you deem unworthy or undesirable for anything more than a casual fling.  In many cases before the light of day fully shines on a situation you might already have some time and energy invested  and if the table is already set  fuck it might as well sit down and have a meal. Its nice to have sex on a regular basis and enjoy bachelorhood.  Why not?Of course NEXTING some annoying obtuse narcissistic dipshit is gratifying but so is seeing some pernicious little brat gobble your cock like its the cure to cancer right before you NEXT her.You wouldnt target a woman like this knowing the whole story and say I hate this bitch I think Ill try to game her and fuck her for sport.I dunno maybe you might want to do that.  Some dudes do.  That certainly isnt the suggestion here.  Most times I think discovery of these issues occur while you are gauging a chick you just met or whatever.  If you are doing it right then its not much work to begin with and youre just opting out before the drama hits.  Whether that is pre or post coitus depends on the individual situation.EDIT  Id like to add that man does not live on bread alone.  Youre going to end up jerking to a shitload of internet porn if every single women you deemed suitable for sex needed to be a critical thinker.By all means be very selective when it comes to LTRs but dont be afraid to taste a variety of fruits in the meantime.,TheRedPill,cj9iqda,24,t5_2ve1u

Leaving your wife would reduce access to your children and expose them to the increased risk factors associated with single parent households. A common theme I have heard from my divorced father friends is abuse of their children at the hands of exwives boyfriends which sadly has had little impact on family court decisions.I fell for its not a good time yet for two decades before my wife declared that she was too old to have children.

The way this relationship ended actually made me seek TRP funny isnt it?.Ive also had flings with girls where I slept with them on the first night and they wouldve been good LTR however things just didnt work out.The point is that you will learn what girls are suitable for LTRs and what girls arent. Its contextual you cant fit humans perfectly into a criterion and deduce which are best. Eventually youll learn how to read people men as well and make judgement based on that. FYI At  I wouldnt recommend getting into a serious LTR anytime soon.

1600308,0,t3_2cmcyq,Great great great post. Thank  alot! Epic quote to whet peoples appetitegtBut since it is difficult for a ruler to be both feared and loved it is much safer to be feared than loved if one of the two must be lacking. For this can generally be said of men that they are ungrateful fickle liars and deceivers avoiders of danger greedy for profit and as long as you serve their welfare they are entirely yours offering you their blood possessions life and childrenwhen the occasion to do so is not in sight but when you are faced with it they turn against you. And that prince who lays his foundations on their promises alone finding himself stripped of other preparations falls to ruin For men are less concerned with hurting someone who makes himself loved than one who makes himself feared because love is held by a link of obligation which since men are wretched creatures is broken every time their own interests are at stake but fear is held by a dread of punishment which will never leave you.I also like your added insights such as thisgtBeta males and alpha males by the way  both types of men are purely selfish but whereas alphas are selfish in the Ayn Rand rational self interest way betas are selfish in that they just want to extract a little security a little love a pat on the head from the hand that feeds them and so on. Never think that because a man is alpha or successful that he is magnanimous  he is as selfish as the beta who will sell you out for a little female approval just in a different way.

A couple of my female friends who married earlier than normal have also lamented not having fucked more guys before they got married.Regarding the  I think that nearly all of them who said that they wouldnt forgive their partners cheating would stay with the man if his social status were high enough. What I think the  statistic actually represents is women in relationships with men that are more less in the average range whom they could feel comfortable and secure with because they see themselves as more physically attractive than their men. Or women who envision themselves being in relationships with such men. And that the reason that  of them couldnt forgive those men is because they feel that it would be an insult to their selfesteem i.e. you dont cheat on me I cheat on you.

You could change me.Were NOT having sex tonight. Hot girls do this so much when you run fastpaced club game and keep pushing the boundary. Ill tell were heading back to my place for the afterparty because the club is dying down and shell say that. Of course not I have a girlfriend lets go.The drama factor makes it fun for her. This way you arent doing this pushpull overnegging stuff when shes ALREADY attracted. If shes giving you the manwhore type of shit tests you have already gotten her attraction piqued now you just have to get her in a more emotional frenzy type of state. With girls who use the I have a boyfriend shit test especially the ones who actually have boyfriends escalating drama is the best way. I like to get these girls thinking that I am cheating even though I might not be. When they say shit like NO I actually dooo have a BF that is not all the time. It not only makes them validate their own behavior and makes me feel higher value it creates this competitive challenge. They get off on the fact that they just must be so desirable because they are making a guy like me cheat on his GF. When in doubt escalate the drama create a scandal with you two at the  center.

They may have to face a reduction in male attention as they age but this is often replaced by their relationships with their children families and community. Men who do not select mates are shut out of this community the older they get. Few characters raise more alarm than the creepy old guy at the family reunion especially if he is ogling the young girls. What begins as the natural appetite of a young man itself problematic enough as any man with a daughter can attest only evolves into lechery.The feminazi nature of biology is unyielding. If a males actions do not serve the greater good of the society then they are a liability. As the vessels of life women can essentially do no wrong.Edit Spelling,TheRedPill,cjml8zt,13,t5_2ve1u

That said.It is thought that at least a majority of formally educated clergy do not privately hold to their faith. Factors that go into it is that formal education opens eyes however even after the soon to be clergy loses his faith he can not simply cease his taken path. It means being in considerable debt or having to refund scholarships loss of ability to get a job or being fired and abandonment by everyone that person knows and loves.So it is my belief on this matter that because the upper echelons of most churches comprises of atheists and agnostics they fall back to the social logic that was indoctrinated into them through their mothers and society at large. Why else would a devout simply choose to ignore what his holy book says? A priest or pastor who says loans are ok as are divorce and allowing women to lead men would certainly not believe in his holy book  which is supposed to be the infallible word of god.

I cant remember how often IVe read but but but a rape victim wouldnt make up a rape claim  no shit Sherlock thats probably because she actually is a rape victim which on the other hand doesnt apply to all people who claim having been raped.

When you seek permission you place yourself below a person. How you can be respected if you are permission seeking? What is the current Mens Rights Movement?In many ways PERMISSION SEEKING.We can talk all we want about life the philosophic challenges that come with taking TRP or concepts of honor respect and rights but I will NEVER sit here and talk to you or anybody esle about validating my rights. They are nonnegotiable. MRM brings awareness to injustices and says because they happen we need respect. NO. Theyve happened to the extent weve allowed them to. We need to gain respect back. Take action. I am a man and I dont demand respect I act already assuming its given. If I run into a situation where Im not I evaluate why and correct it. If its because I fucked up I fix it. If its because someone else fucked up I tell them to fix it. I dont budge I dont supplicate and I dont give a fuck about your entitlement. I walk and see everyone at eyelevel and if you dont theres lots of ways to deal with it. ,TheRedPill,ck1nqvz,1,t5_2ve1u

This bill has nothing to do with sexual assault because it is actually creating a new crime out of thin air. Heres how it goesTheft is a crime conning people out of their money is a crime. We have laws against those things. On college campuses a lot of dumb students are falling prey to clever advertising that make them buy stuff they may not need. A lot of them say it feels like being conned or worse like being robbed. In fact when researchers conducted surveys probing the spending habits of students they found that they are buying stuff that they regret buying afterwards. About  in  student admits to have experienced buyers remorse at some point which clearly shows there is a theft epidemic on college campuses especially when they get stupidly drunk and then browse ebay. Now no judge wants to admit this is theft because they have stupid outdated beliefs about free market and enterprise so we need to make changes on college campuses. Our new law will make it illegal for sellers to complete a transaction with a person if they had some alcohol beforehand and these merchants will be required to draft a full contract when selling something as simple as a blended fruit juice.

1818384,0,t3_2fausb,I got a lot of TRP understanding with gay and lesbian couples I knew.I have hung out with gay male and female couples. This drove home the differences between men and women more than anything else.I saw two gay guys spend about  minutes hashing out a pretty huge financial matter the joint purchase of a new home. They pretty easily figured out a way to do it when one guy had about k less than the other guy with no drama and I mean none. It went like thisGuy  How about I pay an extra  for a few years until we are even? It can go towards the principleGuy  OKI watched two women fight stay pissed for the whole weekend over who should pay for a new Christmas tree. It was a public fight and even the next day still pissed off. Later found out they had a together bedroom and one had a separate bedroom with another having a sleeping area downstairs when there was fighting. For a while they both worked in the office with me and it was quite common to see one or both pissed. Even with the malefemale relationship dynamic removed there I still see a pretty big difference between the way men and women get along.,TheRedPill,ck8asgt,1,t5_2ve1u

I never had much of a weight or confidence problem to begin with but it does wonders if you just feel like an awesome motherfucker even more instead of pretending to be one knowing how small your biceps is.Lifting isnt only about physical health and the attraction it creates its also and IMO thats even more important! good for your mental health makes you happier overall and more efficient at work.

1825621,0,t3_2fgm79,I agree with  of what you said. However I believe TRP philosophy isnt about treating women like dirt so that they stick to you like mud. I believe TRP promotes a more egalitarian relationship between men and women based on the scientific and evolutionary realities facing the different sexes. Men want pussy women want love. They give us pussy for the most part because we talk our way into it. Men have to be charming intelligent and financially stable for a woman to want to give them pussy. Women just have a pussy. They dont have to do extra stuff to get a guy. This is why Men begin to despise women that they are in a relationship with. Because they fall in love with our personalities first and we just like their pussies first. Back when I was more of a Beta I was fucking a girl that had a boyfriend but we were in love. She admitted to me that she hated being with him because he would verbally abuse her and he wasnt as good in bed as me but for some reason she just couldnt stop loving him. He was verbally and emotionally abusive and I was just a typical beta. You can use TRP like that guy and treat women like shit but that is an abuse of our power. It will work but she will probably cheat on you unless you are also physically abusive. We as men have to realize it is up to us to set the tone of any relationship we are in because women dont know what they want from a relationship. The Red Pill says stand up for yourself speak your mind and dont let pussy control you. It doesnt advocate treating women like shit so that you feel good it advocates acting like a man even in the face overwhelming pussy force.,TheRedPill,ck96exb,15,t5_2ve1u

The behaviours and strategies that worked for the long term success of a group were encoded as traditions and became the religion over time.No conscious awareness is required for this. The ancients didnt actually have the wisdom its simply that the behaviours that worked resulted in the next generation being successful and the behaviours that didnt lead to the downfall of the groups that held them.Consider the requirements religions put for birth rate purposes no sex before marriage no masturbation no birth control  its all to help increase population because the religion with more adherents is the one that survives. Couple that with indoctrination from birth and you have a strong recipe for longevity right or wrong.This wasnt designed by someone that sat down to think about it.

The only problem Shes a terrible bowler.But the men didnt boot her off the team. Its an amazing thing because I think that shows you the generosity that they had she said.Her experience with these men turned some of her longheld perceptions about men being harsh and rejecting and women being warm and welcoming upside down.I mean it was just the most wonderful rush to get these guys handshakes and I felt comfortable I mean as comfortable as I could feel right away. They just took me in ... no questions asked she said.The team bowled together for nine months and gradually Vincent gained entrance to their inner sanctum. She found that all the cussing and goodnatured ribbing is just how men often show affection for one another. gt We dont have to do the part where you cross the room and you go up to a stranger that youve never met in the middle of a room full of people and say the first words. And those first words are so hard to say without sounding like a cheeseball or sounding like a jerk.Vincent encountered some pretty cold shoulders in her attempts at the bar but she did manage to go on about  dates with women as Ned mostly arranging them on the Internet.Vincent said the dates were rarely fun and that the pressure of Ned having to prove himself was grueling. She was surprised that many women had no interest in a soft vulnerable man.My prejudice was that the ideal man is a woman in a mans body. And I learned no thats really not. There are a lot of women out there who really want a manly man and they want his stoicism she said.And probably the best of allgt Men are suffering. They have different problems than women have but they dont have it better she said. They need our sympathy. They need our love and maybe they need each other more than anything else.

My dad is a hateful bastard that bailed on me for another family he started once my parents split my mother is a drug addictalcoholic sociopath who attempted suicide in her room during my th birthday party that was going on in the next room the first time cops showed up to one of my parties hahaAnyway the point is people in life are always trying to look for things to blame their failures on its a mental battle we all struggle with. This mentality can manifest itself in people who look at someone successful like myself and their insecure egos will start coming up with reasons that you have succeeded in places that they have failed. This tends to happen most with minorities women and short men.I tried for years explaining this concept to people and in the end it made me more enemies than anything else. So the best thing you can do is take the high road. People will hate you for just being you and what it really comes down to is jealousy.

That applies both within and without monogamy....gt The best gauge of determining a womans perception of you as either an Alpha or Beta type is examining yourself and you feeling a need to mate guard her. I agree that alphas dont realy give two shits if a woman cheats because shell quickly be replaced hence the abundance mentality and benefits inherent in not getting tied down.

You win  she begrudgingly gives you sex which isnt very fun for either party and starts relating like you are just insensitive to her have no respect for her and cannot control your animal urges which provides a lot of sustenance to a negativelyinclined hamster.

1928929,0,t3_2gpwcn,The approach to physical force from both female officers is quite telling.  Theyve both obviously been through training without being trained. Both female officers are struggling with the guy around center mass. Theyre basically just holding on to him hoping that their weight will work for them which it doesnt. They dont understand his strength as even an average guy.  The teenage guy goes straight for headneck. That dude knows whats up. He knows whats effective. Neither woman does.  I didnt see either female officer actually run. They kind of shuffled along at a slow jog when shit goes down. Id bet everything I own that during their training they were the ones who followed the group of men during group exercises and simply showed up at the end to receive credit. Old habits die hard.  If any further proof was needed both female officers simply wait for men to arrive. The men dont wait for backup but the women do. Classic.  Women vs men in any physical capacity simple do not measure up. They are inadequate. Theres nothing wrong with being physically inadequate. Its natural. But when the weaker sex goes around thinking theyre not weaker it becomes pathetic and I do have a problem with that.  Strength is a difficult thing to explain to a woman. Its like telling them there is another color that only men see. Its a dimension they never see and thus always underestimate. They think we both have muscles his might be bigger but I still have them we cant be that dissimilar. Wrong. Most of them learn the hard way at some time or another. Not necessarily through violence. Hopefully its a lesson those officers learned.  ,TheRedPill,cklmebt,23,t5_2ve1u

Ironically once youre that rich women will flock to you without you having to spend a penny and if youre a psychopath you can degrade them via your influence alone.The fact that this billionaire is spending loads of money to get celebrities to go to a ball with him as well as the fact that hes getting married indicates that he is still solidly in beta bucks mode  hes acting like a beta bucks guy who suddenly inherited a billion dollars and doesnt realize that hes now one of the elite so hes basically paying the amount of money it would take for these celebrities to go out with the former beta version of himself without any money.Edit to give you some idea of the influence a billionaire can have look at AIPAC which has an annual budget of  million.

For the majority of men traditionally its been ltr resulting in marriage. The majority of men still do not get to choose about marriage because the available partners are limited. If women want marriage then they will be getting married. The reality is that its just as much perhaps even more a case of women not wanting to get married. Girls in their twenties simply dont want to get married. And certainly not to the provider guys who want to marry them. Basically a whole generation of women have raised their standards for what they expect in a partner let alone a husband and the majority of guys dont stack up.

I also think thats why mothers are so adamant about controlling media uptake of their children because they become selfaware of their own manipulation.

Told her that if she wanted to talk to me we should go out tomorrow to talk and ill not talk over the phone. She told me that she would not go out tomorrow with me blah blah. I stopped her and told her exactly like ill tell this to a little child  I will call you tomorrow to let you know when ill come to get you. She simply said OK.

Next is probably my style my clothes hair bears etc. but MOST women will not be interested. The VAST VAST majority are not interested  or if they are they are not available.

2005090,0,t1_ckujxtt,gtThe source of the data was household interviews people lie. Yes they absolutely do. This has been studied. Here is a study that asked a series of questions on sexual attitudes and experiences in three different situations. In one of these situations the participant was connected to a fake lie detector test bogus pipeline condition. This was compared to a situation in which the questions were asked in front of an interviewer exposure threat condition and asked anonymously. Here was the results see page .gtNumber of sexual partners. The twoway ANOVA on selfreports of the number of sexual partners yielded no significant effects F lt  but the data did strongly favor the predicted pattern see Figure . That is men reported more sexual partners than did women in the exposure threat condition . vs. . where gender expectations are most salient. The magnitude of the sex difference decreased in the anonymity condition . vs. . and the direction of the difference actually reversed in the bogus pipeline condition . vs. .The conclusion made from these results is that expected gender behaviors or stereotypes acts to increase the reported differences in the sexes. If we applied this trend to the data given in National Health Statistics Report then the number of sexual partners for men and women would be expected to converge in a similar fashion not diverge to anything close to . In short accounting for dishonesty in self reports would not likely skew the data towards an  model.  gtThe  model has been proven using genetic studies. First of all Im not sure why you are defining mating success to be equivalent to reproductive success. If this is your justification for the  model then shouldnt the rule be restated as  of women have children with  of men?  Secondly I couldnt find a source on the genetic proof do you have it? I found plenty that suggested a higher variance in male reproductive success but nothing that suggested an  model. Are you referring to Batemans theory or something else?gtThe best way to determine how much sex people have is by DNA tests for parentage of children and how STDs spread.I addressed the DNA above I would like to see your source on this. As far as STDs this would only be a good measure if the STD was guaranteed to be transmitted as a result of sexual intercourse.

Is that really what you are intending?   The sex ratio at birth is commonly thought to be  boys to  girls though this value is subject to debate in the scientific community. The sex ratio for the entire world population is  males to  females.What is your thesis? It is unclear. Is your main point that feminism is the biggest problem in the world today? Do you know that countries where women are treated more equally to men have better measures of overall happiness and economic prosperity?   Are you also aware that companies with more women on their board of directors outperform their peers? If you believe your thesis to be correct read. Read a lot and by a lot I do not mean TRP MRA or other forums where people offer opinions. Read scientific peer reviewed studies. Does the data support your hypothesis?

You dont inherit any rights to your child as a father here unless youre married. Took me  years to get mostly full custody of mine and she can still show up and take him from me with the cops any time she wants because we were never married.Of course talk to a lawyer first.

Well for any rational progressiveminded individual how could you possibly accept that kind of rule? That makes no sense at all.I had a pastor once who was had a gay brother and was sympathetic towards homosexuality. I asked him about this. He had a great response. This law wasnt directed towards mankind as a whole  it was a Mosaic law meaning that it was directed specifically for the Jews liberated from Egypt wandering the desert. If youre wandering the desert and the number of your people is limited reproduction is vital for their survival. So it makes sense that they every orgasm would have to go towards that purpose  their continued existence literally depended on it. But why stone them? Isnt that a bit harsh? Well if youre wandering the desert and you have to punish someone what do you do? Imprison them? They were nomadic. They couldnt waste time building jails for all lawbreakers. Marooning?

Stalin Hitler etc. These men stole control.

They are free to do as they want as it is still a free countryIm a U.S. citizen. Based on their value and actions however I choose not to waste copious amounts of time money effort etc. to interact with them. The total value of a slut is in her pussy. Im not going to buy drinks pay for dates invest precious time etc. for just a pussy. Likewise the total value of a PUA is his sexual ability with girls. That is all he brings to the table. I will not spend copious amounts of my time with someone whose sum total of existence is all about getting the pussy. I will spend my resources and time on myself and those that bring value and happiness to my life. Sidenote I do have friends who are very good at picking up women.

Regardless you may begin to casually engage people out of the frustration of not talking you may find this to be the case if you keep going out and make it your goal to not talk to peoplethats right overemphasize the bad behaviour and see how benign or even silly it can be. Dont expect that nagging feeling to come right away though. Remember you still suck at this.After a while of doing this youre familiar with everything just stick yourself near people and make it a goal to not talk. Again this is after a while not at the start. Your main goal at the start is to just exist and see how you feel getting acclimated. You may find heres the teaser that people open you and want to know your story. If you get the common question why are you alone? Be honest with them. Your experience is unique but Ive told people that I like going out alone because I get out of my comfort zone and meet new people most guys are afraid to do it. Guess what this does if youre being genuine suddenly youre different from everyone else and arent afraid to go out alone. This is just something unique you do and its not a big deal.

Whilst your post clearly lays that out indoctrination and confirmation bias means that taking the information of your post to a feminist or white knight would be near useless.Having a resource that lays out simply the logical fallacies and negative effects of feminism means that a guys who cant be bothered reading big blocks of text with big words can be reached and b more people outside this sub can be challenged with simple questions or statements that dont get them defensive but get them thinking.Cheers mate.,TheRedPill,cl62y4i,1,t5_2ve1u

It was the first time I was cheated on although technically not cheated on because we werent in a relationship.It still hurts to top it off her ex was her first so I know how girls can be attached to them. I just knew that sleazy fuck would try and get her back I cant believe he did. I want to kill him.At the same time it is a beautiful thing to love to have your heart broken. I wouldnt be feeling this way if a nice feeling wasnt there in the first place. But its so painful. So painful it almost makes you wish you never fell in love in the first place.Not to mention Im alone in another country that all my friends are back home that the friends I made last year dont want to be friends with me anymore because admittedly I acted very arrogantly and assholish last year because I was trying to be something I wasnt.Life is being tough on me right now Its lonely my love isnt as pure as I thought it was my friends are gone all I feel I have right now is the internet and video games. To top it off Im also fucking broke. All my life all I ever did was hide my emotions because I had a shitty childhood whenever something bad happened to me I simply could not be bothered feeling anything  about it because I was hurt so much before.

OP here needs to make sure hes got X Y and Z that he can point to for his inner frame to put him into prize position. OP does not currently have the frame necessary to pull it off and I agree this will lead to divorce if he does not change. OP you need to be able to sit down list the reasons you are better more desirable smarter etc.  than your wife and you need to believe them all. Then you need to take action every single day that is congruent with you being that high quality of a person whether she sees it or not.OP Lift. Stop making excuses. Not being fat naturally is not an excuse. Youll just end up being a skinny fat unimpressive looking AFC. Bulk up and get big  muscular but not fat. It will take time and it will be difficult.

Its not for your protection. Its so they can have that box ticked that they did their due dilligence if you go wearing the coffee machine as a hat and get electrocuted. Why is there a health and safety briefing? Simply if you burn in a fire they have that box checked that they told you what to do your dumb ass didnt follow guidance.If a newspaper reporter happens upon a company  staffed with white males its going on the front page. These dynamics are in place so claims of companies being institutionally racist sexist or ageist cant happen. I dont like it. This whole drive for more women in tech or this that and the other is just an organizations way of tooting their liberal love trumpet and scoring brownie points about how diverse they are. People by in large dont like reality. They dont want to hear that the average computer science graduate applying for a C role is usually going to be male who most likely spent most of his younger years playing around with his tech at home learning how to develop tools and games and finally arrives into the working world with a lifetime of knowledge spawned from genuine interest. They dont want to hear that if youre recruiting for roles in deepest rural Essex you shouldnt be surprised if every person that turns up for an interview is white simply because if you walked around the town there just arent many nonwhite people! These perfectly sound reasons mean nothing and if you call a thing somethingist long enough it becomes true regardless of the reality.When a HR person suggested that I need to revise my team dynamic come recruitment it isnt because theyre full of womyn love its simply them doing their job and covering the companys ass! Thats it! It just so happens that being pro women in tech is very much invogue at the moment and thus most corporations are shouting that message high and loud as much as they can screech. If suddenly serious health issue sufferers were invogue theyd be screaming We need to teach people with MS how to code and departments would be signing up cancer patients left right and center! I dont agree with any of this. I am a cog in the same machine! But I get paid for work I do and when I walk out of the office the work stays in the office! I fully agree with all your sentiments in that its strange how there are no campaigns to get more women into coal mining or bricklaying. Its strange how there are no campaigns to reassure men that a career in primary education wont be ended simply because a student who got an F cries rape or that there are no Stop Rape campaigns by these same feminists in war torn Africa or Middle East nor are they extending their social justice swords to draw attention to atrocities in Syria. Nope apparently teaching women how to code is how we solve all the problems. Bear in mind this is teach women how to code. Not actually become developers who know how to design solutions think logically and creatively and assimilate that into a well defined algorithms that they know how to properly formally document and test. Nope apparently cramming syntax down their throats and giving them k pa positions will level up the score.So while I agree with the injustices of all what youre saying HR arent the beast behind this madness. They are simply the enforcers of it!,TheRedPill,clbiui8,7,t5_2ve1u

You cant educate these women on indian culture its just not going to work the media buttfucks their minds with the most unsexy stereotypes of Indians. Youll never see shit Indian equivalent of Olympia Bodybuilding or welldressed muscular Indian hunks on TV. We live in a culture that also makes the THINGS indians tend to like engineering CS etc low value nerdy things despite our society needing them. Just forget it I downplay it. I groom well and have decent muscle and I look like a north Indian light punjabi type and most of these girls dont even know Im indian. Rock the damn what race is he? intrigue  because we are so used to seeing short skinny Indians dressed a certain way when you just look so different these Americans do not even recognize you as Indian. This is the best way to get Indian chicks too because they want to fuck anything that feels western and counterculture.When you are dating them that is when you can introduce them to Indian culture. Teach them how to cook teach them about the real idea behind a lot of our negative stereotypes like sati or our misogyny. A lot of Indian cultures have a lot of respect and reverance for women and a lot of our mythology  symbols are FAR more empowered than some biblical figure. Teach them about your indian culture because different zones in India are incredibly different there is no indian culture in a specific way. Dont watch Bollywood movies fuck that shit youll give your brain AIDS. Its a boatload of BP nonsense where the nerd always gets the supermodel chick western shit is fetishized and the sap  hero always pedestalizes some chick. Bollywood is basically the LCD of indian culture. Ill tell you whats alpha about Indian culture. We have a shit ton of selfmade billionaires Pakistan too who came up in this sort of wild west by any means sort of way. The culture is hard status is everything EVERYTHING and the caste system is real. Humans are not equal. This leads to Indian culture emphasizing that as a kid you start doing WHATEVER it takes to make it into the top universities so that you can crack into the elite or alpha caste if you will. Mental discipline. Indian culture like Asian  Korean culture traditionally was be stoic dont show emotion keep a poker face and dont embody feminine qualities. Indian guys from the poorer areas of India who managed to come up are RP as fuck. Its the sons of these selfmade men who tend to be soft spoiled losers waited on hand and knee by the servant. Punjabi culture is pretty alpha too heavy emphasis on fitness and strength sword fights traditional roles for women and very high expectations for men to adhere to a strong masculine role. ,TheRedPill,clef5gm,13,t5_2ve1u

Life isnt handed to them so they resent men who make it look easy and give resources to hotties willy nilly. They drop out and get pissed rather than trying to improve herself. Eventually they will be seen for what they actually are bitter unattractive hags with no redeeming qualities and a lack of effort put forth to have a beneficial quality.I know large women who work hard at making up for their less than subtle looks. They are anti feminist because they realize they have to work to get somewhere. However these women are a minority on a large scale. No pun intended. Most want the handouts rather than putting forth the effort. Once that is recognized due to them having zero value towards beta and omega men who jerk off to a video game that for all intents and purposes is better than any  or  they have orbited the feminist delusion will drop. Once that happens like you said the attractive girls will try harder the ugly ones will quit and the quality of men will be forced lower so the attractive girls can get some. If they want to fuck me it sure as hell isnt how dead sexy I am its how brutal dominant and forceful they want me to be while I rearrange her internal organs.

Women have a genetic disposition to secure the best possible genetic material for reproduction on a subconscious level as reproduction is a much bigger investment for them. If a mans looks actions and persona are able to convince a girl he is a higher value man than her current partner and she does not actively resist that feeling with logic good traits about her man etc. shell probably cheat.

I know you didnt do anything but a lawyer can talk you through what to do now to keep yourself out of trouble.  Also if her hamster gets so wound up that she decides to press charges you already know who to call. You need to contain any damage that shes causing you. Past that if you actually enjoy college beyond the bar scene throw yourself into your work for a bit.  Do your readings for once. If that doesnt suit you start thinking seriously about your career. Talk to older relatives and friends who have already started their career.  Ask them about how they got their first postcollege job etc. Go get yourself a part time job somewhere or try to get more hours if you already have one. It took me almost a year of bumming off my parents for me to figure out my career plan after finishing college.  Wasted fucking year. Im happy with where I am now career wise but that doesnt mean I couldnt be a year further ahead. Theres no excuse for not figuring shit out ahead of time.Set a fitness goal for yourself. You want to be able to bench a certain amount? Run a certain distance? Set a training regimen and stick with it. Youre on the right mental path you just need to commit to a direction. You need to find something besides women to occupy your head space.  Im not saying you need to go full monk mode just that you need to start striking a balance.

This is probably a better way to meet men than women but having guy friends is very important anyway. I know this sounds lame but a lot of fit attractive interesting women go to contra Irish square dancing and very few dudes.  If you want a good fm ratio I have seen almost no better activity out there.  See if they have that in your city.  They do in the NE and NW.  It isnt like Salsa dancing where you have to be good at it. Pick up a musical instrument.  Talent is the only thing men can acquire that completely trumps physical attractiveness.  I know in this sub lots of people consider alpha males to be tall and fit but talent is better.  Most people would consider me very attractive but I have been envious of several ugly dudes in my life that were talented musicians. Dont put aside your hobbies when you meet a girl.  Thats what girls do when they meet guys and most find it unattractive when men do it.,TheRedPill,clinw3r,1,t5_2ve1u

2205257,0,t3_2kd5px,Great theory and all but the crux of this is to take action as a man.  To put the video games down stop watching porn hit the gym and better yourself.  Women dont find that many men attractive because in reality they arent.  Compare the average skinny guys body to that of a physique competitor and there is simply no comparison.  The average skinny girl however DOES have a body that compares to the bodies of fitness models.  Women ARE more attractive to men while men are less attractive to women.Thats why its so important to have a great physique among other things.  Sure you can act all alpha and have money but woman will never look at you with the same lust they would with guys that are yoked.

Yes every adult know that the Disney fantasy of Erostinged happilyeverafter BS is an utterly empty illusion.  But that doesnt invalidate the concept of  Agapeinfused relationship based on hard work and mutual respect.  I can point to a number of successful long term relationships  years in some cases where both partners are reasonably content.  These relationships are based on mutual respect mutual compassion and division of labor according to temperament and ability.  Problems arise when one partner is disrespectful lacks compassion andor refuses to do any work.The major problem I see is that our culture and more importantly our laws create perverse incentives for women to behave badly treat their male partners with total lack of respect and compassion and drain them of every last dollar and drop of energy.  Of course I dont see this changing any time soon without some kind of cultural collapse which is surely coming due to the escalating viciousness of thirdwave feminism.

However I remember the polite child I was thanking her for all our cooked meals and making some comment about how good it tasted with the exception of some vegetables my parents allowed me to be picky about.Once I moved out on my own I quickly discovered that most of my favorite homecooked meals were pretty damn easy and quick to make. I fairly quickly became proficient in the kitchen and even still plugged in recognized the overblown nature of my mothers rants about Slaving Over the Stove. I made mention of how easy to prepare my favorite meals were some point after this and it was like Id slapped her. I got an ear full about how cooking for a whole family was SO MUCH more work.My monthly expenses are always the lowest when Im cooking for myself rather than eating outobviously or being lazy and eating preprepared meals. Buying your meat and veggies raw and putting in the prep work is healthier AND cheaper. Most of the people that tell you healthy is more expensive either havent tried or are going the yuppie expensive organic everything route. Apples to oranges or something like that.,TheRedPill,clnl0ov,42,t5_2ve1u

2233523,0,t1_clnomm6,gt How were you going to feed them? Buy takeout every single meal? If you cant cook for them you cant nourish them.No silly Rabbit not every meal.. Breakfast is easy  cold sugarloaded cereal or poptarts.. Lunch  thats the governmentschools problem.. Supper  take away or take amp bake or frozen dinner or restaurant or something from the deli or probably just let them have chips amp soda as a special treat.See... women dont need to cook for their kids and takeout would only be about once a week.S And make no mistake this was a collusion of not only industry and media sustained by advertising but also of government.  Remember all the shit about meat especially bacon or sausages and eggs being evil? Well that plays right into the cereal amp juice i.e. sugarcoated carbs amp HFCS laden drinks are better for you... Industry Kellogs et al want that promoted and so does media how much advertising does the Egg council do? versus how much will be done by the various different brandsflavors of cereal and other similar breakfast foods? Eggs are basically just eggs... they are generally speaking pretty much locally grown  there is little than can be done to them in the way of branding  and thus little that can enhance profit margins cereal on the other hand can be extruded and molded into countless thousands of different shapes have almost endless color and artificial flavor introduced as well as being puffed in ways that give the illusion of bulkvolume even though the actual foodcontent amp nutritional value is decreased.  And then of course government also colluded on the back end via farm amp so called price support i.e. market manipulation policies the natural free market even with all of its advertising was only able to get consumers to eat a small amount of such processed breakfast foods the preference even after DECADES of effort by Kellogg et al of most people was still for an eggs amp bacon meal in the morning in part because it was factually CHEAPER and more readily accessible had dozens of variations in form amp flavors ... so the government had to step in regulate basically END local eggproduction making them far more expensive increase the pricing of chicken feed... and conversely subsidize the production of highvolume corn amp grain amp artificial HFCS sweetener production to provide the literal grist for the cereal mill companies who then had lower indeed trivial product costs and could instead focus on packaging amp advertising which is also subsidized in the sense of being allowed to be written offexpensed from tax accounting something that is taken for granted but is FAR from obvious  ask yourself why YOU cant deduct your basic necessity expenses food rent clothing and only be taxed on the profit but that industry can deduct whatever the fuck it spends no matter how ridiculous to promote its product sales... that too is a policy choice not some law of nature.,TheRedPill,clnqgad,84,t5_2ve1u

2241722,0,t3_2kt9rl,Someone in my family came out as lesbian after years of struggle. She had a husband and  kids and a moderately religious upbringing and shes around  now so it was back when homosexuality really wasnt discussed much in society. It was rough on the husband obviously and the kids and on her and her parents but what was the alternative? That she spend her life pretending to be straight for them? You only live once. The painful realisation that she was gay came slowly. She honestly didnt know when she married a nice guy with whom she had a lot of common interests including a desire to have kids she thought that was love. Shed had crushes on older girls in school but she thought that was normal in a girls school. Being gay was utterly outside of all terms of reference for her.  Then she fell in love the penny dropped and after trying to ignore it for a long time she gave up and talked to her husband family and kids. The husband was amazing massively hurt emotionally of course and disappointed but intellectually he could understand it. Personally she seemed awkward to me before her revelation and as soon as I heard and thought about it I thought to myself Of course Anna is gay its so obvious.  She and her husband separated but lived near each other so the kids could move between the houses easily. When the husband had to move a long way away for work Anna uprooted herself and the kids leaving her girlfriend and friends behind to again find a house near him so the kids could switch between the houses and a new job for herself. I know a friends brother who came out to his wife just a few years ago again with kids in the mix and again a huge shock. The last I heard he was still publically the good straight husband and father. Hes pretending hes not gay for the sake of his family but should he have to? As in my relatives case the kids would cope and better to have  happy parents than miserable ones in a privately broken marriage. And the wife she should be out finding a straight man to love her and the husband a partner. My point in this ramble is that it does happen and its not an easy situation in any way and there really isnt a bad guy.,TheRedPill,cloryjx,2,t5_2ve1u

2352769,0,t3_2magu9,Wish I had read this forum before I let this happen to me.I was transferring into a college away from the CC in my hometown. I had a bad case of pussy addiction the sex was amazing and told my girlfriend I wanted to maintain a long distance relationship.After about  months this conversation took place over the phone nearly word for word. I wasnt worried because picking up women has never been difficult for me. In the next year and a half I slept with  women. I used protection every time. I made sure the relationships were as close to purely sexual as I could and I cut off the girls whenever I felt they were becoming emotionally involved.During this entire time I still felt love for my girlfriend back home and called her a few times a week just because I enjoyed her voice sense of humor and discourse shouldve realized there are a million fish with sexy voices funny ideas and stimulating opinions.She told me that she had fucked a few other guys which I didnt mind because she was still paying for  bus tickets to come see me  miles away every month.Fast forward to the end of our relationship. She disappears. I have no idea where she went her phone does not work and her friends play dumb. Two months later she calls me crying. She says that she made a horrible mistake and got pregnant with one of the men she was fucking on the sides children. She says she eloped with him to Mexico and it is too late to get an abortion now. She says that she is getting married to him for the future of the child. She says she wants to remain my friend. She tries to lead me on by saying that she wont be with him forever and that if I can wait I will get another chance.Suddenly after realizing that she had been feeding me milkshakes with bluepill blended into them TRP was in front of my face without ever seeing this forum. Some instinct from deep inside of me compelled me to respond with thisYou broke our agreement. You had unprotected sex. You are emotionally engaged with a fuck buddy.  And you expect me to be friends with you after you bear this mans child?Fuck you I will not ever lay eyes upon your spawn. It is a reminder of a time when I was weak. Polyamorous relationships do not work and you are proof of that. My brother will come by your house to pick up all of my items this Sunday.

Because thats the cognitive dissonance youre suggesting here.  If a woman is a slut at  years old shes still a slut at  years old.  The dick history doesnt go away just like a rape history doesnt go away.You could apply this with any action.  Ask any alcoholic.  Even a chronic alcoholic who quits drinking with treatment will STILL have an urge to drink    years later.  I know because my uncle was one until it killed him.  Sorry but taking  or  cocks by the age of  is not normal behavior.  Its indicative of an addiction at worst or poor decision making at best.  Whether you want to admit it or not your past has consequences on who you will be in the future.When a woman wants to show off her school achievements she will point to her college history and degree.  When she wants to prove how career oriented she is she will point to her work history and accolades.  When she wants to show what a good person she is she will point to her history as a volunteer at soup kitchens and charitable events.But when we are trying to determine a womans worth as a faithful sexual partner were just supposed to ignore the last  years of hopping on cocks and just take her word for it that shes not like that anymore?If you dont understand what Im saying come back and talk when the hamster tires out a little bit.edit shes not gonna have the chance looked at some post history just discovered she was here to concern troll and lecture.

2391241,0,t3_2ms6z7,ObservanceGrowing up my dad told me the importance of this. I was raised pretty bluepill and awkward but this means the neighbors admire my politeness and good behavior. I lived in a quiet middleclass subdivision. I always played sports outside with the other kids in my yard and my dad hangs out with the parents and uses his handyman skills to fix things.. By the way out of the small group of neighbors that do know each other my parents are the only ones not divorced Im the only kid thats at or headed to a university and the other kids are going down bad or mediocre paths. So our reputation is like an oasis of levelheadedness intelligence and downtoearthness. Were not that bright of a shining light its just a pretty dark room.One time my neighbor who was a year younger than me who is now fat and slutty brought a few of her friends over to wreak some havoc. Shit like driving recklessly stealing a garden gnome ding dong ditching suburban hooligan bullshit. Her dad catches us all. We woke him up. Hes pissed. He starts to yell at her like fat Italian dads do. She notes in conversation that Im present  in a subtle way and soon enough he calms down. Later he explicitly told me that he knew things were okay because I was there. They werent.Theres an extra lesson in this. If you were raised bluepill and nice guy that means people may very well think highly of you. People say they want politicians who get things done dammit. But they still end up voting for the politicians who look and sound niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiceeeee.

Remember that not only do men and women have different criteria for a mate they also look for and demonstrate love differently. We feel sympathy for the beta enamored with a girl because hes still looking for the love of a mother. The RP man understands that thats not something that she will ever be able to provide. Its that understanding that focuses a man into the best version of himself so he can rechannel his love from a beta provider into an alpha provider gifting giving fatherly love to a potential mate rather than taking searching for motherly love.gt Its almost like you guys are angry that women need to be physically attracted to their partners.Tingles do more for women than physical attractiveness.

2510113,0,t3_2odeaf,I was in a  month LTR with one of those blondes. That blonde that wears yoga pants and UGGs drinks at starbucks and thinks shes a princess that is entitled to everything. You know the kind.This is how I got her by not giving a fuck about her and her beauty. She is part of my social circle so it wasnt a cold approach. First time I met her I attracted all attention on me from.everyone at the table. As expected she tried to get it back. With every intreruption I would call her on it neg her playfully teasing her ans generally making fun of her  for the amusement of the group. After a few more drinks I moved to a chair next to her and started talking one on one never complimenting her looks or being phasef by it.Basically treated her like any other female. LTR ended when she bacame batshit crazy. Honestly she was crazy from the beginning but I was so infatuated by her beauty that I ignored the crazy. Jealous possesive demanding of all my attention and so on. She was acting like I was her only option...which sais a lot about her considering her looks which reinforces the idea that AWALT and you should treat them as such.,TheRedPill,cmm7kl0,1,t5_2ve1u
2510118,0,t3_2ods8n,My daughter only child is nearing one year old and its a bit conflicting thinking how I want her to grow up. On one hand Ive been on the losing end of hypergamy and know how it feels so I want her to have a respect for men and treat people fairly. On the other hand she is my daughter the only child I will have and I want her to have everything she can. When other women are playing by their own rules how can I set her up for success by confining her options?I remember a story from a while ago about a false rape accusation. The guys mother was a prominent feminist lawyer or some shit and she was shocked and appalled that something like that could happen to her son. Feminist solipsism was working great for her until it affected her progeny.To me the question of how to raise a boy is answered easily by a man who has swallowed the pill. But how to raise a girl? To avoid hypocrisy I should teach her how to take everything she can and if some poor betas sons get hurt in the process tough shit.

2511037,0,t3_2ob2qx,My wife and I have been together  years and have been married for  months now.  TRP helped me solidify her attraction to me and most importantly has given me the tools to keep her attracted and loyal for the rest of our lives.She was cute and chubby with a low Ncount I have a thing for cute faces and full asses with a fairlyalpha father who showed her the importance of independence and seeing through bullshit.  She was teased a lot during middle school and puberty and never developed the entitled bitch mentality which helped lead her to be academically and professionally motivated.  Since weve met shes graduated with multiple degrees gotten started on a promising career and has dropped  lbs. mostly due to following my lead she started about  months after I hit PX hard.Loyalty from women comes from her being biochemically addicted to you which is remarkably easy to do if she has a low Ncount.  Multiple orgasms Sex God Method learn that shit release floods of dopamine and oxytocin into her system.  Talking dirty or emotionally during orgasms lets you almost speak to her subconscious due to a hypnosislike effect present when shes cumming her brains out which can further her obsession with you.  I also learned some interesting things from the Seduction Science website which goes into sexual hypnosis effects and changing her subconscious programming... YMMV though with that site.As far as DHVs and dread go I am very fit and much better looking now than when we started dating which is only a good thing.  Shes told me on many occasions that her husband is fucking hot.  I have a stable position within a rapidly evolving engineering career and have told her I want kids before we hit  that she also agrees to thus solidifying my role as the providerprotectorfather figure women love.  Per MMSLP Ive upped my good Alpha with physical and emotional dominance especially during sex and upped my good Beta by proving Im reliable and stable.  This week Ive been building all the new pieces of furniture for our living room we got as a wedding present example of good beta nest management.We go to ballroom dancing lessons or group classes  times per week which is essentially hacking your marriage.  Youre literally leading her around the floor for hours.  Dancing with hot instructors learning quickly and gaining a reputation as a good dancer and then dancing with every woman there instills deep dread as she sees you enjoying yourself with many different beautiful women in a short amount of time.  Some of the best sexual experiences weve had were after getting home from dancing.Just last night she made steak and potatoes for dinner we went to a group dance class where I made a point of dancing a tango with  different instructors when we got home she initiated on me.  During sex she got to a point where she was cumming very hard so I started telling her I love fucking my wifes tight pussy I love you so much etc.  All true of course but saying these things and having her repeat them back to you during orgasm especially makes them sink in further always remember dopamine  learning.  After sex I went back to building furniture while she cleaned up the kitchen and continued decorating for Christmas.  Just a daily example of a good Alpha and good Beta mashup.TLDR SGM seduction science MMSLP low Ncount decent father dance classes keep building value FUCK HER GOOD it catalyzes and solidifies the addiction keep frame and pass shit tests.EDIT If shes a bit sexually reserved which many nonCC riders can be buy her a Kindle wait a few months then buy her a surprise present of erotic fiction because all women have those books on their ereaders I figured you should have one too.  You have to act like you dont give a shit and never mention the book to her again shell probably bring it up to you.  I recommend Sylvia Days Crossfire series as it gives women a vivid description of being dominated and opens her mind to it.

2515633,0,t3_2ogm1a,Valid points were brought up in that article but theyre missing a huge part of hypergamy. A woman over  has lower SMV than a younger woman. Her hypergamy is on the down slide. She is now forced to prove her worth when she sees that you recognize your attractiveness in the eyes of younger women because her attractiveness is fading and she knows that you are perfectly capable of getting younger tighter vaginas. This can be but does not have to be directly related to how you look. Celebrities bang women constantly. How? Not just because of their money but because they know they have the confidence to bang whoever they want and women are driven by jealousy and value. ,TheRedPill,cmmxj6w,3,t5_2ve1u

You still havent and I can imagine he has got his hopes set high I can imagine its hard for a gay guy to find other gay guys. Most guys are a bit homophobic and are quick to show disinterest when confronted with possibly gay behaviour so he probably is used to getting rejected in an early and straight forward manner.Up until this point from reading your story it seems you have still not shown him any signs that you are uninterested.

It doesnt take much of a drop in self confidence for a girl to seek greener pastures or what appear to be greener. The only thing keeping her around is your attractiveness and if it wanes slightly its pure luck if she stays because all the risk is yours the benefits all hers. Society pushes the you go girl mentality and they follow it its female natureeven if they cant see the precipice in that direction. They will run headlong to it like lemmings then rationalize the fall as being your fault for being terrible abusive small dick etc. With kids and marriage comes cash and prizes for her if she jumps the fence. That means less incentive to stay with you. Anything can wreck your attractiveness  illness economic downturn loss of job simple boredom her friends getting divorced or just a loser who appears to be higher value and it doesnt matter if he is or not.Go ahead do the LTR but protect yourself and always be ready to take the L and punt her ass to the curb.

Two people pool resources and have children further expanding their wealth at least back when adult children would contribute to the household.  It is much more cost effective to pay for the living expenses of two or more people in one household than it is when everyone is living alone.

A farmer goes We have all this technology to make food faster and cheaper  payday for the big corps right? Sure! But none of these smart rich guys stop to think or ask the questionSHOULD we be feeding corn to cows? DO cows have  stomachs to digest tiny little pieces of maize? Cows ARE an ecosystem unto themselves like many other herbivores taken for food.But when the lawmakers sold out to the big corps they didnt forsee the domino  ripple  domino effect it would have on the medical industry food safety regulations the EPA etc.Now there are lawmakers who have people and kids in their families with diabetes mad cow etc because mommy or daddy signed a law that deregulates the food industry like how the recession came about by the massive deregulations of the banks.Fast food burgers are made in the same vats and in the same way as ice cream is made. When you bite into a burger youre eating bits and pieces of roughly  different cows many of which died from infection by standing in their own fecal matter. Cows end up literally shitting themselves to death diarrhea from  stomachs digesting liquid corn for half their lives. And this is a risk that the governemnt and corporations deem acceptable solely because its profitable for themHumans are geared to for  things in nature because they USED to be rare and hard to attainSUGAR SALT and FAT.We used to have to hunt and gather to get them all in the same day. Now we can roll into the drive through between bouts of gas and get all  for under  bucks but a head of lettuce is . alone.This is no coincidence.

Everybody is vein. By appealing to his own ego and sense of self youre likely to make a lot further a lot quicker.  The key is to find one topic which you can strongly connect with.

2761284,0,t3_2rkz4s,Early s but will chime in anyway. Regret the things you do not the things you dont do. Getting shut down by a girl is far better than realizing you pussed out on a sure thing when its too late. Looking back I have to accept that because of my BP behavior Ive Betad myself out of far more pussy and sexual adventures including a three way with sisters than I will likely ever get in the future no matter how RP I become. Master yourself. Study your own weaknesses and learn to maneuver around them. Look inward more than outward. Abundance mentality is for real. Leaving yourself thirsty and scared nearly guarantees failure in many things in life. Lifting heavy and consistently does so much more than simply make you look better. It improves all aspects of your life. No girl is worth sacrificing your self respect for.  When entering an LTR make sure you are doing it for the right reasons. I.e. Not just to be not aloneBefore giving up on an LTR or allowing yourself to fuck it up by going Beta make sure you are certain you will be happier without her and arent sacrificing a very good partner for a phantom perfect one. Dont underestimate the power of porn to induce complacency. Value moderation. I would add that it is to not sacrifice your humanity. The ability to empathize with people different from you is important if you arent going to walk around angry all the time.   This is a potential pitfall of becoming too obsessed with RP thinking. Everybody  everything can start to seem like an enemy that needs to be defeated. ,TheRedPill,cnhy4bn,2,t5_2ve1u

And where its not the road to home schooling is quite difficult and its socially ostracized to home school your kids.. Which means that literally the VERY BEST years of your life are UTTERLY WASTED. When youre young you learn so fast. But they keep drilling the same propaganda bullshit into your head over and over instead of teaching you the skills you need. Who cares that you have all this technology now if by the time you get home from school youre too fucking exhausted from being psychically raped for  hours to do anything but zonk out in front of the tv or youtube.. The most important things we learn in life isnt information its skills and perspective. These are best taught through human interaction. Oftentimes that is the only way to teach them.. Free thought or critical thinking as they like to call it now you can also call it creativity isnt something thats taught. Its something that everyone is born with. The education system is a means to drill it and shame it out of you. People wouldnt choose shitty tv over the excitement thrill and awe of learning something new IF.... they hadnt already come to the conclusion that learning  bad experience because school  bad experience and school  learning. In other words school indoctrinate people to believe that learning is awful and difficult when in reality its the most exciting thing there is.

My suggestion would be not to include a neg and a number request in the same group of text.  Im not a fan of the neg via text I think it nearly always comes across as rudeness stemming from insecurity.  But if you want to neg keep in mind that a neg stands on its own and you need to watch for her response before plowing too far ahead.

2822824,0,t1_cnot9db,Your points here are fantastic.gt a good king often behaves like a bad man would only with an army to back him up.Id say a bad man is only bad because the king has the law on his side. Bad men have armies and when the law is viewed as unjust the bad men are seen as revolutionaries. Which makes me wonder if the  years of lack of brutality is this way because of the rise of feminism and technology. Feminism is so pervasive right now and everyone is on video all the time it makes a revolution of brutality near impossible until the numbers are large enough. Im not sure if feminism will be overthrown through brutality and an awakening of women realizing they had it better being second place to a man with average value for a lifetime rather than independent and trying to be with only the alphas and CCing their value so low that men would rather die alone than marry them. Perhaps a brutal revolution will be one where MGTOW crash the marriage market and women will feel more desperate to get married because most guys dont want to. Its a soulless act according to society that is actually men finally realizing that doing what is best for them is the best way to improve society pursue greatness regardless of brutality like Khan. Trying to get some thoughts down there but perhaps you have some commentary on this questionIf the demise of feminism is a fast one will it be out of brutality similar to Khan or perhaps a brutality of a crash in the sexual market of marriage? Or do you suppose it would be one of gradual change? My own answer would be that tyranny feminism is usually a slow development and the revolution gets a bit of ground in the shadows but strikes hard and fast before the current power realizes whats happening. But Im not a history buff. ,TheRedPill,cnoy606,1,t5_2ve1u

If it was financially irresponsible for mom to leave than the dad should be the DE facto custodial  parent. You want the benefits of having the kid full time than you should bear the biggest burden of support.  You hit the nail right on the head with that statement. My dad is the only man I know who actually won full custody and child support after a divorce. My parents got divorced when I was in kindergarten I believe. At the time my mom was a total nut job and completely irresponsible with her money actions etc etc. My dad gathered all evidence against my mom during their marriage in case they would get divorced one day.

Red pill to the core.Im in my early s now  I suppose which might put me somewhere between younger and older but I digress...Taking the red pill has done countless things to me for me. I have a tendency to be overly wordy and verbose  I love expounding on my thoughts for sure  but if I could condense what the red pill stands for me in an attempt to be as concise as possible as to what the red pill is all about in my eyes Id boil it down to these four words  ..MAN..THE..FVCK..UP..Thats right  embrace your masculinity. Become hard. Become resilient. Take pride in your tenacity. Impress yourself. Set out to do something special with your life i.e. your life mission. Gravitate towards those who want to do something unique with their own lives. Push each other to become the best versions of yourselves. Challenge yourself. Dont waste time feeling pitiful for blue pillers or arguing with them  let them come on their own accord. Focus on YOU. Become conscious of your thoughts eliminate those which do not strengthen you. Make your happiness become one with your constant selfimprovement. Seek resistance. Push through hardships but embrace those too as they are nourishment for your own personal development look at what crushing breakupsdivorces did to many us. And finally do NOT hate women  understand them. Push through the angerresentment phase if you find yourself caught in it. Dont take them seriously. Dont run from them  enjoy them. Show them that with you they are dealing with a MAN who values and respects himself enough to demand the best and who has zero problem walking away from a raw deal and youll be fine.  ,TheRedPill,cnunztd,20,t5_2ve1u

2895176,0,t3_2t96t4,Ive read the comments here and they pretty much follow the same advice thats always been given in communities like this which is Never get back with an ex they are exes for a reason.  Better yet use her as a plate.I would agree with this to some extent except in the case that you are ABSOLUTELY certain that this is the woman you are going to end up marrying.  Let me explainI have never ever under any circumstances ever reinitiated a relationship with an ex girlfriend because I know that the problems will exist and in order to me to maintain my frame SHE must change who she is.  Unfortunately women are selfish and will not change.  They are persistent creatures leaving you to constantly have to establish dominance and work extra to maintain your new frame which will lead you to become stale and bored.In your responses you claim that you were being a beta the entire time and she got bored this is a perfect opportunity to maintain alpha frame and dominate her but if there are problems with the nuts and bolts ie your personalities to match up well she wants to control you etc. then you might run into some issues regardless of frame.  An argument can be said that if youre maintaining frame she will essentially bend to your will but this is not always the case my man it is for plates but not for LTR that end up lasting.I speak from experience as I have broken my own rule about getting back together with an LTR because after sleeping and dating around for a few months after our break up I realized what madness I was putting myself through and wanted some stability.  Luckily for me the girl I love and I have reconciled and she is everything I couldve asked for.  She is red pill as fuck in her own regard and she is truly my equal in every way.  We play off each other share the same goals many of the same interests and actively live the red pill lifestyle.  She is truly a dream come true for me.  But it took me dating the status quo to realize how great she was and sometimes thats just how it is.You have to make a decision for yourself man.  If you get back with her make sure that you can see yourself marrying her and maintain frame forever.  If even one thing is out of place in your assessment I wouldnt recommend retrying.,TheRedPill,cnx6okb,1,t5_2ve1u

2899265,0,t3_2tbhbv,Ok Im going to be the devils advocate here.Obviously you had a very high level of initial attraction built up even before you met   once you do that it is easymode. You can just sit there and stand tall while she talks and talks and then just go for it. Its not hard to mess that up. How physically attractive are you? I think it is extremely easy to get a lay on tinder if she has a very high level of initial attraction built it. What I am saying is  most men would not be able to say or do the things you did to her. The dynamic would not be in their favor. a dynamic based on physical attraction. When a girl is physically attracted to me I literally can say whatever I want to her including bold statements as you mentioned and even stupid stupid beta stuff and still get her. I think its maybe unfair to attribute all the success to game. My point is  work on your looks looks looks looks looks. Get big if you are skinny dress well hold your head up high.

Secondly  be yourself IS good advice  assuming your true self is desirable towards women. Better advice would be change yourself but even though women know they themselves arent attracted to a beta they DO absolutely still believe the blue pill idea that there are many other women that will find betas as desirable.  Being yourself generally implies confidence and comfort in your own skin. That is an essential part of getting with women. You can certainly not be yourself and gain for short term hookups but in the context of LTR women are biologically designed to sniff out and test men. So if you are yourself from the beginning it will last longer.

For us instead of telling genetically disadvantaged men look you might not ever be able to achieve that but still try to be your best we just instill this false hope that they can actually achieve it if only they lift enough dress well enough have enough charisma etc. Sometimes even that doesnt get them what they want.

3043499,0,t3_2v0pmi,Let me paint you a picture dude everything will make perfect sense if you think on this.Picture a shelf in a pharmacy. Different feminine products are on sale therein. Woman after woman walks up to the shelf picks something she wants leaves for the checkout. You are going to be cast in the role of the feminine product sitting on the shelf.Nobodys picking you so you wonder what the fuck is wrong with these women? Or with you? Your package isnt the best but its alright. You have decent femaleacceptable bluish colours and the product inside is pretty good  it really does the job the woman who buys you is not going to be disappointed. So whats going on?You start from the assumption that youre going to get picked by passively sitting on the shelf or by improving the product quality. Thats the entire problem dude.  You think you can package yourself up all nice and then women will come and buy it. Or you envision becoming the best product you can be and then women will come and choose you because youre genuinely the best available choice. You may truly work fucking hard on the packaging and the quality of the product. It doesnt matter. If you dont understand how to actively sell yourself how to conquer the markets desires and subjugate them to your will you pretty much already lost.Around here selling yourself is known as Game. A vast field of nuance and strategy to contemplate and adapt for your own purposes. The key paradigm shift you will gain from it has to do with no longer being a passive product on the shelf available to any woman. You actively make yourself mysterious and exclusive you hide the true nature of the product youre selling you frustrate women on purpose in their search. This stops the women their tracks being the kittycats they are they are instantly curious excited the chase turns them on. Nobody cares about the product its the thrill you give her by making her chase that she wants! Then you turn most of the comers away and work hard to vet the few you decide to keep around to make sure youre giving yourself away into good hands.,TheRedPill,codghuu,6,t5_2ve1u

3081911,0,t1_coeyg14,You sound like a copy of me lol.I have always had a bit of machiavellanism in me. But most of my interactions with people were exhausting because when queueing up explanations in my brain during a discussion not able to dissect one topic before the one I am talking to switches over to the next. So I just added up on things to say but never got to say more than  of what I was thinking and never got the point. Beaten by idiots all the freaking time! PBut post  I started developing my machiavellianism before I even knew the term. It was part of me starting to swallow small doses of redpill. I am slowly starting to drop the urge fully explain my standpoint in a discussion. I still do and it feels great when I do get the opportunity. Last time I did it was today actually but i realized it was somewhat of a waste. It was a sweet female colleague who is intent on listening when I speak because she appreciates me in certain regards and seem to respect me. But I realized about  into the discussion she was just nodding and agreeing to be polite towards me she put up with my boring behaviour because it was me. I was only stroking my ego by continuing at that point. Nowadays I at least notice when I am more rational than needed and I rarely use much logic when interacting with people any longer. Switching to social mode is a skill I have developed at least fold or so the last  years. Still need a lot of practice but I reap the benefits so far. Its a weird sense of accomplishment when you suddenly start to predict and control some people when in the past almost everyone could control you.I never really wanted to control people but didnt realize that this is how most of the world works and it explains peoples behaviour. After this disillusionment I want to play the game too. Luckily I am mentally gifted and can use that to train myself up to average social level already done in various areas and then strive beyond.Sadly I have very few peers that I can connect with in rational discussion. A select few online contacts. The rest of my needs for rational discussions is spent online on forums like this.,TheRedPill,cohfs6n,1,t5_2ve1u

3102008,0,t3_2vlluj,Frankly it is a difficult world for men despite some of the talk about how we should forge our own destiny and be men.  According to some statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor there were more women employed within the U.S. and more women graduating from college.  Of course women tend to not work as competitively as men but with feelgood laws and hiring practices many men are left out in the cold.Government jobs generally provide vastly higher income and benefits than the private sector equivalents but women and minorities tend to enjoy preferential hiring policies further allowing women to outearn men.This is disastrous since the social factors are often ignored because the world does not give one shit about us.  If a woman is say unemployed and living in her parents basement she can still find sympathy and support and can still easily find sexual relief which is important for a mans well being in my opinion.  A man in a similar situation is considered to be lower than dirt.  Men dont care if a woman earns a low income but the inverse is not true.  Add in divorce rape and unless the man makes well above the average income he will likely be in terrible shape financially and therefore ostracized by society and women in particular.,TheRedPill,cojispz,7,t5_2ve1u

3107827,0,t1_cojk3l3,gt No it was not as grand as mens role but it was still necessary. I kind of disagree.  I think women had the grander career in traditional gender roles.  Indeed if women failed at their role raising children and making a home then mens role would be rendered difficult or impossible.G K Chesterton said it bestgt But when people begin to talk about this domestic duty as not merely difficult but trivial and dreary I simply give up the question. For I cannot with the utmost energy of imagination conceive what they mean. When domesticity for instance is called drudgery all the difficulty arises from a double meaning in the word. If drudgery only means dreadfully hard work I admit the woman drudges in the home as a man might drudge at the Cathedral of Amiens or drudge behind a gun at Trafalgar. But if it means that the hard work is more heavy because it is trifling colorless and of small import to the soul then as I say I give it up I do not know what the words mean. To be Queen Elizabeth within a definite area deciding sales banquets labors and holidays to be Whiteley within a certain area providing toys boots sheets cakes. and books to be Aristotle within a certain area teaching morals manners theology and hygiene I can understand how this might exhaust the mind but I cannot imagine how it could narrow it. How can it be a large career to tell other peoples children about the Rule of Three and a small career to tell ones own children about the universe? How can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone and narrow to be everything to someone? No a womans function is laborious but because it is gigantic not because it is minute.

Its an advanced form of communication and interaction ahead of the opposing poles of aggressivepassive it offers winwin outcomes instead of winlose.  The assertive person is chronically successful in his social interactions and this shows in his demeanor even upon first approach to others.   Contrast it to the person who never asks for what they want and are chronically unhappy from passively letting others have their way and LOOKING unhappy too.   Then they abruptly blow up and have an aggressive outburst shaking out a gunny sack of pentup social losses and having a moment of I wineveryone around me loses before settling back to I lose everyone else wins.Assertiveness training is one of the best things a nice guyunfortunate doormat type can do as an early step away from this beta pattern.

3130064,0,t1_combsdx,Day game is not worth the effort for those who are weak and lack self confidence. To do Daygame effectively you must embrace Rejection.You must also already be happy internally and not insecure with yourself as I have seen many of my students give up because they cannot handle how emotionally hard getting rejected can be and take it personally.If you arent getting rejected alot then you are not approaching alot. Eat Rejection for Breakfast and Success for Dinner.Yes it is true there is a low success rate for getting laid through cold approach and I will not lie to people and tell them it is easy to get laid.To get laid through cold approach takes good strategy and hard work. It takes time as you cannot learn these skills overnight or in less than a month. It takes time and patients and alot of cold approaches to gain experience that will push you to your limits.I sent you a private youtube video through private message so that you could see how I can easily approach a girl even when with a group of friends and still ask if she is single and get her number.Also in regards to your questions about the most recent  day approaches lay rate.I have got a bunch of make outs and several blowjobs and  same day lay from my last  approaches. This shit is tough and drains you energy but it has never drained my confidence and I still have a lot of fun doing it because I know I am good at what I do and other guys arent on my level yet.My last same day lay was after I was on campus and went to one of the campus buildings to take a dump. After using the restroom I was walking down the hallway and saw some girl walking slowly so I decided to give her a hi . Then as I did that I asked her whats her name and told her shes cute and if she was single and ready to mingle. She said she was single but not looking for anything and she tried to friend zone me right there on the spot. I told her Im not looking for new friends and she then still offered me her number saying that we can still talk tho. After seeing that I quickly changed the subject to where she was going right now and that we should goto the beach. She declined as expected due to Last Minute Resistance her reason being she needed to go across town to pick up a relative before traffic in LA started. So I said it was nice meeting her. I asked her for a hug by and while hugging her I held on for longer than usual and asked for a kiss by. She gave me a kiss and then from that moment on I knew she was DTF I just have to figure out how to get her into adventure mode and a nice private place to fuck. So I had some useless chatting while making out back and forth with me lifting her up because she was petite and then I offered to escort her to her car. Fortunately for me while walking to her car she was parked in the same area as me. So I stopped her and made out some more and asked her if she could stay a bit longer to chill but she gave me a lot of last minute resistance due to not wanting to be late cause of LA traffic. I persisted and she finally gave in and was shocked my car was nearby so we made out in the back seat of my car. She gave me some good head deep throating me and stuff and then I proceeded to fuck her in my car. Quick Player Tip have a fresh pack of condoms in a heat protected lunch bag underneath your drivers side seat for protection when you finally find DTF chicks to fuck.

Initially demand goes up. Price inflates insanely as hitmen realize how much money divorced men would lose otherwise. Soon it becomes a nation wide issue like school shootings have and women slowly stop divorcing due to fear. Demand goes down. Price goes down a bit. Police step in and go undercover trying to catch guys hiring hitmen. Demand drops even more as guys dont want to get caught. Supply drops. Divorces go up.

3266287,0,t1_cp0k4vk,I am writing as a former Canadian divorce attorney. Even there there are differences from province to province. Not just any relationship will do it has to be marriage like and there are a whole series of factors that judges will look at as they parse through the evidence where one or both people are lying through their teeth because some significant money is on the line. Playing house is a big indicator. Two years tends to be the hurdle but you can get nailed for child support for kids from the previous relationship in as little as a year.My understanding is that California set the stage for palimony with our good friend Lee Marvin but New York doesnt recognize common law marriages.This is just a summary and not legal advice. But the practical advice is to look up the laws in your jurisdiction and perhaps lay down a bit of money for a lawyer to walk you through what sort of obligations the state might impose on you without your knowledge or explicit consent.

Her Part  post makes it clear she receives plenty of messages online and its also clear shes meeting guys working day game and meeting guys through friends.  This allows us to put a concrete number on what we already know that women have guys thrown at them all the time.  All that attention converts to  guy shed actually consider fucking per month not counting any ONS action on the side.  .  Over half of her first dates take place in a bar.  If you want to stand out find something more interesting to do when you first meet.  .  She classifies her relationships with these men as hang outs  this terminology reflects how she has no desire for anything long term at least not right now.

Gaming economically is a superior return on investment compared to a woman in terms of hard cash theyre cheaper convenient and posit a sense of achievement when compared to the economic furnace of a woman.

3310129,0,t1_cp4zoi8,gt Life has been here for billions of years. If the earths climate were to go haywire at the slightest disturbance I doubt life would have gotten as far as it has.I havent read all the replies to your comment but this ignores the realities of complex systems. Firstly its a logical fallacy to say that because something has been true for billions of years it still has to be true now. Sure that can be a reason to be skeptical about it but we have evidence of the climate changing plenty during those billions of years so theres no reason to be skeptical about the fact of climate change. Secondly no mainstream scientist claims that global warming will end all lifefar from it many species will thrive. It will just make our current human lifestyles a lot harder. Climate change has the potential to threaten modern human life not all life on the planet. Thirdly your skepticism about the impact of slight disturbances is unwarranted. Our influence on the environmentspecifically on CO levels in the atmosphereis not a slight disturbance. Though CO levels may be low that does not mean that the effect of it is slight. A few grains of ricin powder is enough to kill a person would you feel it is safe to eat a few milligrams of ricin just because small things cant have large effects? So even though we are not pumping a large amount of CO into the atmosphere relative to how much atmosphere there is we are pumping a lot of CO into the atmosphere relative to how much CO there is. Scientific American reports today that atmospheric CO has reached levels of  parts per million a level not seen in some  million years. Yes  out of a million is not a lot but comparing  to a million is not the right standard to judge by. Comparing  to the CO concentration of the last  million yearswhich ranged from about  to  parts per millionis the right one.,TheRedPill,cp5kz0x,1,t5_2ve1u

A court ruling in  also compelled Eric to also give her a car and to pay for a chauffeur a cook and two nannies. He also buys plane tickets for the children and nannies for two trips a year as well as a daily allowance of up to  for the holidays.Quebec Justice Minister Bertrand StArnaud said after the decision that even though the court ruled Quebecs family law wasnt unconstitutional his government wasnt ruling out reforming the law.He said it may be time to consider changing the law to grant better income support protection to unmarried women who leave a commonlaw relationship.It is true in the last decades our social and family reality has evolved. Is it time for us to start to think again about our family regime in our civil code? Maybe. Today the door is certainly open to a general reflection about our family regime StArnaud said.He said he would consult cabinet colleagues as well as legal and family experts before committing to a major reform of the laws.So even without common law the bitch still got a HUGE payoff.

When theyre actively pursuing the other sex women message the most attractive men x more frequently than they message the least attractive men.  If that sounds unbalanced consider that men message the most attractive women x more frequently than they message the least attractive.  Assuming the average attractiveness of the men and women doing the messaging is the same men are aiming higher far more often than women.

Theopaulson this isnt a knock on you  it just is what it is.  years and a few kids in yours has weight I hope it lasts amp at that point good odds that it does.gt But marriage can be the most red pill thing to do possible.I strongly believe that being a father and patriarch of an intact functional family is the highest position for a man to strive towards even despite that this statement is just not true. Again not a knock on you  RP is about knowledge that increases your SMV amp gets you the most out of it  whatever your end goal. For those wanting a family myself included here is some knowledge the vast majority of marriages end in divorce and  of kids do not belong to papa. They odds arent favorable and while only the weak are detracted by such odds we must be aware of them.gt why get married other than kids? ..share a really fun life with someone who kicks ass and supportsYou dont need to gamble half your shit alimony for the rest of your life and utter financial slavery for  years for a shot at happiness and its about time the role of patriarch became unlinked from the cancerous piece of shit that is Marriage .. For those of you already married  or choosing to get married  those are your choices. But dont go around senselessly advocating or evangelizing them to others or you may deprive them of the possibility of being a father with a happy family and longlife partner without the risk of all that you yourselves have already irreversibly risked.

3432818,0,t3_2zidlt,Theres nothing wrong or beta with having insecurities. Insecurities wash away with time and patience if youre constantly working toward what you want out of life. I think that more people should learn to just say fuck it when it comes to things like this. Insecure about making that goal winning shot? Just say fuck it and let the shot happen. Insecure about asking that cute girl in class out or chatting her up? Just say fuck it and do it. Insecure about getting up in front of the class and giving a presentation? Just say fuck it and DO IT. Pure and simple throw yourself into the fire. Let yourself fail get up and do it again. You gotta stop comparing yourself to others too and thinking hes more alpha than me and shit.. If youre constantly working toward your goals have a good pleasant attitude people are gonna like you..  Sure some people may try to use you for your good nature but its your responsibility to weed those types out of your life cause god knows theyre not going to just stop using you because its not nice. I feel strange saying this and Im not religious by any means.. But thinking what would jesus do or a similar religious figurehead type I guess Buddha maybe? Or Moses? IDK.. Not too knowledgable with that stuff... Because all those guys were generally HONESTLY liked by a lot of people and a lot of folks hold those ideas of companionship love and community true to themselves.

Given the statistics it honestly seems like deceptive mating is a typical mating strategy for women.Also note the theory of how this was possible because children may have been considered a communal responsibility allowing for sexually top tier men to impregnate as many women as they want with financial impunity.

At the time I was only joking but after swallowing the red pill right around the time my final ex and I broke up I realized how unintentionally accurate my quip was.And now after studying RP theory it has all come together what I thought I knew in shadow form has become a clear perception and I see RP truths everywhere and I cannot unsee them.Recently for example I was in one of my usual neighborhood bars but one where most of the patrons were in their mids to mids. Some chick in her mids was there  fit petite brunette solid  just my type seated at the end of the bar between a couple of smiling betas who were buddies of mine and I was standing adjacent to them at the corner of the service area. She was loud and childish basking in their attention and at one point she tried to extract flattery from them by asking how old they thought she was. Naturally they underestimated it but that wasnt enough for her.I wasnt part of that conversation but my quiet detachment attracted her attention. She latched on to me and insisted I take a guess. I said You dont look a day over  she screeched OMG youre such an asshole  and I knew I had her. Right from in between my buddies. She kept it up I had a hard time keeping my words to a minimum and my facial expression limited to an amused smirk and the situation escalated to the point she was forcefully yanking my arm trying to get me to flatter her but I didnt budge and kept on making slightly uncomplementary nonsequitur wisecracks that drove her bonkers.This incident is reviewed in another post of mine in light of a blogpost by Chateau Heartiste at rTheRedPillcommentssfuyufishingforflatterychateauheartisteThe rest of the story is beyond my point  no I didnt leave with her  but this never could have happened before RP. I would have joined in the flattery. But RP enabled me to read directly from the script she was following and anticipate her every move.Looking back Im somewhat disgusted by her overt emotional immaturity. But I see through it now. Im also disgusted that at one time a girl like that would have been a serious prospect. And I would have convinced myself that the inevitable insane drama in the relationship would have been nothing more than the normal vicissitudes of a relationship. I see through that now too. All told it is a turnoff for me.Now that I am serenely free of womandrama in my life I have a real choice. I can get a girlfriend and keep her in line with learned RP skills or I can save myself the effort altogether and stay volcel. I have chosen the latter. Its a tradeoff to be sure but on the whole Im happier without the burden of having to stay on top of things.Youre not alone uleftajar brother.,TheRedPill,cpvc7e0,3,t5_2ve1u

3538038,0,t3_30r8kw,If you think about it a relationship is nothing more than an extended negotiation about the price of a womans vagina. Observe a man and a woman talking. If you froze time and asked the man hey bro when would you ideally like to have sex with this woman? the answer would ALWAYS be uhhh right now.But if you asked the woman she would have a different answer. So the man and the woman keep talking in order to negotiate the price. Betas dont understand value because if they did then they would realize that EVERY MAN IS PAYING FOR PUSSY EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY HAVE SEX. EVERY MAN is fundamentally a john and every woman is fundamentally a whore. Money isnt the only thing that has value  a mans time and attention also has value and men are ALWAYS required to exchange it in order to obtain sex.  The only difference between a normal relationship and a prostituteJohn relationship is that the latter is honest. ,TheRedPill,cpvk4my,11,t5_2ve1u

I know that doesnt mean that marriage cant work at all Im aware of good marriages as well but those are becoming fewer and fewer each year. Check out the side bar here at TRP and read a few posts. There are far more women out there that would make you believe you fathered a kid who isnt actually yours than ones who have ever picked up a philosophy book.And there is no reason why it must fail it just is more likely to fail than not. Considering you can have a female confidant without being married why do it? You can have a gun it doesnt mean you must play Russian roulette with it. Most people that own guns dont because they see it as a . chance to harm themselves with no upside to it. Marriage is the same but instead of gambling with your life you gamble with your financial well being and the well being of your family. And the risk is much higher than when playing Russian roulette. Why not be like most gun owners? Have a good woman in your life but dont turn her into an unnecessary risk.

3690114,0,t1_cqcmmom,every single person in a position of leadership will get shit tested. if the leader can diffuse the shit test he proves he is still a capable leader.a shit test is a Test of PowerThe vast majority of people are passive by virtue of being unable to lead invent create or be aware of how to maintain complex things without a checklist. They shit test their leaders to see if the leaders are still in a position of power because if the leaders are weak the majority will seize what the leaders have created and take it for themselves.This was the wisdom of the ancients social rank is everything. Those who are lower will unless oppressed always attempt to subvert the higher and they will do it cleverly because they invest their intelligence in dissimulation instead of logical futureoriented planning.Perhaps there was a trigger incident  the Black Plague the Mongol Invasions or even simply a population boom  that set off the testing but once it started the masses confronted their leaders with a choice beat us down or be beaten down. Their leaders too full of heart and sympathy to do what was needed began a gradual retreat that continues to this day.At some point the shit test will get the response that every passive person secretly desires which is to be dominated. A leader will line the horizons with heads on poles and tell everyone what to do. This will acknowledge the basic tendency of humanity which is that unless given purpose the average person becomes a clever agent of destruction and nothing more. Oppression is freedom.,TheRedPill,cqcwbbq,6,t5_2ve1u

Meaning there is a financial incentive for women to behave in accord with AWALT. I think that was your take home point and I think its powerful.Personally I bristled at the idea of not being able to train a woman. I can train a dog. I can train a cat. I can train my mom my cousins my friends. Of course I can train a woman. Do lion tamers get attacked occasionally? Of course they do. Is it worth the rush? For me yes.I dont believe in sexually exclusive read committed relationships but I do believe in caring mutually beneficial relationships with women and all the hullaboo about AWALT can be a bit grating.I absolutely agree with AWALT. All women have those biological tendencies and inclinations. And as youre pointing out they even have a financial incentive for following AWALT scary really.And if someone comes inside the walls of this forum and tries to say I dont believe in AWALT then we ought to rightly smack him upside the head.But Im reaching the end of my rope with anecdotes which say See? AWALT! because the illogically drawn next conclusion is Women are untrustworthy always in all circumstances no matter what. Thats simply not true. They have urges. Like we do. Some would argue that our sexual urges are in fact stronger than womens. AWALT and there is something we can do about it. Women are not the devil.

She was basically shopping for someone to tell her what she wanted to hear and she eventually found it in a male white knight religious counselor with no formal training at a local church. This fucking schmuck... The ex had done her typical rant about how I control her with money and wont let her have nice things. Truth of the matter is she wanted dressage horses and acres of land with stables and a big truck and horse trailer with built in camper to take them to shows and on and on and yours truly didnt have a quarter mil just laying the fuck around to blow on that dumb shit. Do you know what this prick told me? Buy it anyway. Borrow the money at any cost. Your wife isnt happy.

Math and engineering did. Not feelings.Actually I am familiar with the type of intelligence that is wrongfully called emotional intelligence. Its defined as the ability to be empathetic to tolerate to trust to function in stress and so on. Calling it emotional intelligence sound like a bit of an agenda to me.I am trying to tell you that this type of intelligence does not come from feeling emotions. It comes from realizing them and managing them. Emotions are a chemical process that is managed by logical people so they can perform intellectually on a higher level. The word emotional intelligence stinks of feminist bullshit because its pushing the idea that emotions are somehow like a kind of wisdom. Like I said maybe biowise as in a nature knows best macro kind of intelligence. But not momentarily wise as in my GF freaked the fuck out when she saw a puppy and I told her she cant have it because it will pee on the carpet. How did that kind of emotional reasoning or wallowing in uncontrolled emotions puppy  cute  must possess close to me to experience more of same feelings get us to the moon?I think youve made your point clear enough and I dont accept it as simply as you do.,TheRedPill,cql093a,2,t5_2ve1u
3761586,0,t3_33hz61,Its not the most important thing and it very well can be looked over if you have other attributes but it matters. The main thing TRP teaches you is that it doesnt matter as much to women as it does to men. Lots of average looking guys slay s and s on a regular basis but the worse looking you are the better you have to be at everything else. Sure the reason for that is that youre aesthetically pleasing but more importantly it means you will be desired by other women. Thats the main reason. Plus one thing evryone has to remember even if a woman likes you and youre not attractive you have to be someone her friends will be jealous ofapprove of other wise that outweights her attraction to you  fold.

Actually Im Catholic so Id point to Original Sin and say APeopleALT just different genders and even different cultures and social strata display different immoral proclivities.  However in the past society which is to say religion politics and culture broadly reigned in the worst impulses of men and women.   Were there sluts and cads throughout history?  Undoubtedly and there probably always will.  The difference between just about every other era and culture and now though is that they were examples of failures to live up to the standard.   Nowadays we just dont have a standard to fail generally.  Our main standard seems to be dont rape but of course in true Orwellian fashion rape can mean anything from brutal sexual assault to an ugly guy politely expressed romantic interest in me in a welllit public place.  I dont think it is pessimistic.   I think its realistic.  Humanity is capable of great beauty and good but also we have being shitty to one another down to a science too.  Again Im religious so I dont expect secular or atheist folks to find these words as comforting but I always go back to Mother Teresas poem on this.  Its actually kind of RP if you think about itgt People are often unreasonable illogical and self centeredForgive them anyway.gt If you are kind people may accuse you of selfish ulterior motivesBe kind anyway.gt If you are successful you will win some false friends and some true enemiesSucceed anyway.gt If you are honest and frank people may cheat youBe honest and frank anyway.gt What you spend years building someone could destroy overnightBuild anyway.gt If you find serenity and happiness they may be jealousBe happy anyway.gt The good you do today people will often forget tomorrowDo good anyway.gt Give the world the best you have and it may never be enoughGive the world the best youve got anyway.gt You see in the final analysis it is between you and GodIt was never between you and them anyway.Now this doesnt mean be an idiot and bend over and take everything.  It just means Hey people will suck.  Expect it.  Dont let it shatter your world when it happens.  Truck on anyway. At the end of the day though people generally get the culture they want and deserve.  We sort of point to our grandparents as demigods the greatest generation.  But rather than honour them I find it often gives us a subconscious excuse to settle for mediocrity which IMHO is what RPers do when they settle for spinning plates and nihilistic pleasureseeking but thats just my subjective opinion.  ,TheRedPill,cqpv7cf,1,t5_2ve1u

Honestly I can believe that because in the last decade I was finding out how much she is actually fucked up and crazy Im . She comes from a fucked up household that is completely amoral and had an alcoholic father that beat the shit out of her till the point of blood when she was a childteenager. She had no parental skills and because of her mistakes at age of  I near died before I was saved by my father.She has immesurable amounts of respect for this abusive asshole that also kicked us on the street when we needed a place to stay in a catastrophic event which affected my country a year ago and an immesurable hatred towards my father which married her when he was  she was ish and the only reason he married her was.. you guessed it.. because her father forced her out of his home with a fucking cleaver and he took her in to save her.. while completely fucking himself over.

I was probably  points higher than my wife although she was a  at the time and she has maintained very well. I have always advanced my career which evens out the lows in physical fitness. Yes her lower SMV was part of my decision but she also had the type of looks that age very well.Hypergammy has never been a real issue in our relationship. However shit tests were always a problem in our relationship. I gave her too much comfort and not enough alpha. She became spoiled and entitled. I have been fixing this since finding TRP.Honestly my best advice regardless of her SMV is learn to fuck your or any womans brains out. I am talking continuous orgasms for  minutes that leave her forgetting her name and incapable of moving for  minutes after your done. Once you have that down learn to fuck her for  minutes with her having continuous orgasms the whole time. Make the  minute sessions your target for everyday sex as she needs some sexuality left for the next day. Then occasionally unleash the earthshaking sex when she can relax for a day or two. I use to unleash all the time and frankly after she had a night with  orgasms she was satisfied for too many days. My wife has told me repeatably that none of her friends ever wish to discuss our sex life with her anymore. They either dont believe her or start drooling at the thought of me doing that to them. That right there will keep hypergammy at bay more than anything else.,TheRedPill,cqqthut,4,t5_2ve1u

Its cheaper than a vasectomy while data isnt  out there that its just as effective as one.   a hormonal pill would be the bees knees to male birth control. Unfortunately mens reproductive system isnt nearly as hormonal as a womans. A hormone pill would work great its easy its effective and can be turned on and off like a switch all from your own pharmacist.  An invasive procedure such as injecting gel into your scrotum may equally be effective but also requires a rd party to implement.   Theres a reason why high school men are not lining up in droves to to get vasectomies nor will we probably be seeing men line up in droves to get their scrotum injected with vasagel.   I do however foresee droves of men lining up to take a pill.,TheRedPill,cqsok04,-7,t5_2ve1u

3839226,0,t1_cqtijzu,Its to do with their sense of identity.These people have folded opposition into their core identity. A part of who they perceive themselves to be is their opposition to various things.Be it the feminist opposition to the patriarchy the marxist opposition to the upper class the SRS opposition to bad things on redditTM  the actual item it doesnt matter coincidentally all of the things they are oppposed to are somewhat nebulous concepts. What matters is that they oppose it. TRP is easy for people to mischaracterise flanderise and slander as this horrible misogynist monstrosity that just hates women so much and this concept is an easy thing to oppose in fact most RPers oppose it too!.When you do something a lot it becomes easier for you. The more you define yourself as what you arent the easier it becomes to do it for other things that you disagree with particularly if you are working off your perception of the thing rather than what it actually is. The more you make your opposition a part of your identity the easier it becomes to make new things you oppose a piece of your identity. This causes trouble later because once something is part of your identity its very difficult to remove it.The problem with defining yourself this way is that should the thing you oppose disappear you will have lost a section of your identity an experience that is often quite traumatic even if the lost section appears trivial its still forcing you to confront yourself. Due to how humans work the thing itself does not have to disappear for you to perceive it as disappearing  it just has to drop out of your perception. Thus these people are compelled to obsess over things such as TRP lest they lose sight of it and with it a part of themselves.Thus you see why these people despite their continued and vocal disavowal of the things they ostensibly oppose in fact rely on them to form their identity and would be troubled if they disappeared.

Someone whos worked in a factory for fifty years and gets laid off in his fifties cant suddenly turn himself into an engineer and get back to work. Education is ridiculously expensive takes multiple years and the payoff becomes less and less certain.Education is ridiculously expensive because of the governmet.  Aside from that point there are other ways for one to improve their skill set aside from formal education.  And as I said before lower levels of employment is not a bad thing if its being caused by improvement in productivity and technology.  Saying otherwise is like arguing that the invention of the automobile was bad because it put down the horse and buggy industry.gtAutomation does in fact tend to cause lower levels of employment. This isnt the s where unskilled labour was still possible even with its value shrinking. People dont work less hours because of automation we just have less people working. If the amount of man hours a week to keep a factory working drops from  to  the result isnt everyone working  hour work weeks its  people getting laid off and the remaining  continuing to work as long as they did before.I see no evidence that on average automation leads to a reduction in employment rather than people working less hours.

Theyd now decided  mutually she thought  just to be friends. When he ended up falling asleep on her bed she changed into pajamas and climbed in next to him. Soon he was putting his arm around her and taking off her clothes. I basically said No I dont want to have sex with you. And then he said OK thats fine and stopped. ... And then he started again a few minutes later taking off my panties taking off his boxers. I just kind of laid there and didnt do anything  I had already said no. I was just tired and wanted to go to bed. I let him finish. I pulled my panties back on and went to sleep.gt Six weeks later the woman reported that she had been raped.When George Will wrote a piece stating the obvious  that its clearly not sexual assault because a girl could ask to guy to leave but decides shed rather have sex so she can go to sleep soonerYou saw an outpouring of stuff like this from feminists heres one from Time magazine where apparently he got fired  gt  In his June  columnwhich has gotten him fired from the St. Louis PostDispatchhe recounts a story from Swarthmore College in which a woman experienced date rape. The woman had been hooking up with a guy but then decided to just be platonic friends a decision she thought was mutual. One night he fell asleep in her bed and she put on her pajamas and climbed in as well thinking nothing of it. However he began to pull off her clothes. She said no but he persisted and she relented and let him do his thing. Six weeks later she filed rape charges.This was typical of what feminists were claiming    gt When he does use terms like sexual assault or rape survivors he puts them in scare quotes to remind us that those are terms used by supposed victims. In George Wills arrogant little head those victims do not have the intellectual capacity he does to really understand how to distinguish a legitimate rape from just boys being boys I guess...Mr. Wills views are all too prevalent in our blame the victim rape culture.They got colleges to set up tribunals where they would try and kick out accussed rapists like this one  because of stories like this girls. That was around the time when finally people started to wake up and say this doesnt make sense.Not having the fear this could happen is nieve because they already pushed it into law only being forced into backing down when they got unlucky and several high publicity rape accussations proved to be completely false after that and they lost momentum. ,TheRedPill,cqzt2z7,1,t5_2ve1u

3902296,0,t1_cr0opjx,True it wasnt really what OP was asking but I think people place too much on the idea of purposemission. I would say focus on accomplishing goals not finding your purpose in life. For example my purpose in life isnt to have a good career lift weights be well read travel the world or spin plates. I wasnt put on this earth to do those things I saw the benefits and choose to do them. I made goals and accomplished them. To me finding your purpose or mission seems to place things outside of your control as if you were born to do something and If you dont find it then thats a problem. I guess what I am saying is maybe there isnt some thing you are meant to do and instead you should rationally weigh the benefits and drawbacks of actions and make decisions accordingly. How many people decide there life calling is in journalism psychology or the many other majors that dont get jobs? Yes some people are amazing at these things and hit it big but beyond them is a wasteland of failed dreams and poor decisions all based on the idea of life purpose. So for some they never find a life purpose and will forever feel as if they failed and for others they will find it and still fail. Focus on tangible and realistic goals that improve your life not some higher calling or purpose. Maybe its just semantics goals or purpose but I think there is enough difference people get sidetracked on one. ,TheRedPill,cr13h1b,2,t5_2ve1u

We walked up with a big group and as my friends were distracting the guy I pulled her aside and kissed her. She looked me straight in the eyes and said I think youre so hot I want to fuck you.

3917174,0,t1_cr2nggs,This is on point and missed by the cool kid new TRPers omg you so angry brah.Fundamentally it is the masculine extreme to murder rape destroy. We were the gender designed to utilize force and dominance to get what we wanted. It was the feminine extreme to unabashedly hypergame lie cheat manipulate sabotage steal.Society has done everything it can to neuter any kind of natural expression of sexual violence and aggressiveness from men whilst encouraging or permitting the extreme natures of women.Boys banned from full contact sports in schools school fights broken up and  tolerance approach to violence even in self defence any male making a move or asking a girl how her day is going is now liable for Street Harrassment and creeperdom. It is politically incorrect to suggest that anger is a normal emotion for... well... everyone. It always has to be meditated out smoothed away with counselling conditioning pills and societal programming or shame.Well it wont go away because it is fundamental core of humanity and a necessary one of Masculinity.Women respond to all the related themes of murder and rape strength sexual dominance disregard for other peoples opinions whilst society seeks to wholly nullify it. Anger and rage is not only  normal it is a healthy aspect of male nature.That leads a lot of people to incorrectly believe I advocate a tweaking lunatic in day to day life. If men were allowed to get more outwardly angry when they get fucked over at work home the playground without every mangina and female trying to shame him or label him a danger to children we wouldnt be in half as much mess as we are already.Mastery of thyself is real.

I never told my friend that it was my mom that left those messages.. Later on down the line in high school she came out about her dad being listed as a sex offender and told me that he was just at a party when he was young and the girl accused one of his friends of raping her he just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. She then told me that a lot of her teachers just assumed that he had raped her even though he still had custody of her? WTF?! Some people are fucking crazy.

Some ideas A lot of space means that its easier for her to sit away from you. I have an upscale place but kept it low on the furniture so basically they have no choice but to sit next to me on the couch. Alternatively you could rearrange the furniture of the room youre taking her to to allow for some dancing or whatever else you can think of that gets some kino going. Your surroundings trigger different behaviors in you. You might be inadvertedly betaing it up in your place. Read some of the FRs and see if youre doing anything different than these guys. Review your own actions and behavior. If youre certain that your impressive housing arrangement is triggering their nesting instincts you can counteract this with the words you say. Make it understood you dont date women you havent slept with. You can communicate this indirectly but also say it directly.

3993051,0,t1_crbcir9,I agree. Women like to claim that theyre involved in something for the experience but almost always what theyre really after is the status and social benefits resulting from it. A good litmus test for this is whether they tell others about what theyve done. Many men never share many of their experiences and achievements because the reward is intrinsic and not dependent on others approving and validating those experiences and achievements. Women on the other hand will tell others about something almost immediately after beginning it without even finishing it first and in many cases before theyve even started whatever theyre working on. If theres no one to tell theyll take to social media. Thats because what theyre after is to have others think theyre great rather than actually being great. Its the same reason we constantly hear women proclaim how strong and independent they are when in reality a lion does not need to roar for the rest of us to know how powerful it is. This constant attentionseeking behavior from women reeks of desperation and belies how little strength they truly have. ,TheRedPill,crbfwel,10,t5_2ve1u

She will leave you and rationalize that she never loved you in the first place because she has someone better than you in her eyes. How could she love you when she now has a new and improved man?Hypergamy isnt just looking for someone better than her. It is her ability to branch swing and keep climbing the tree to new heights.

4005213,0,t1_crcd4at,Indeed we are motivated to have sex because this is what feels good  having offspring is really just a byproduct. Thats the nature of the selfish gene we are but only their vessel. Women are definitely not big picture thinkers  this is one of our biggest gender differentiators. And lastly yes women are comparatively irrational  again a significant gender differentiator.The female being vindictive is however not accidental. I would suggest that it does serve a real purpose in our species social organisation. It is too predictable as an outcome and too strong in its social consequences for it to be merely a side effect of mere female irrationality or if you want a mere biological artefact. Sure the vindictiveness does not come from bigpicture thinking. It isnt necessarily calculated or even conscious or organised but similarly to sex it does serve a very specific purpose evolutionarily. When you were in grade school you probably noticed how when girls started to sprout titties they also started to assemble in castes and start having little secrets amongst themselves. The highest rated girls mean girls  influenced the entire social calendar. They could ostracise anyone at will using their weapon of choice which is social shaming leading to outcasting. What you observed then was the unhidden naive beginnings of what is essentially hardwired into women first is the need to position for social influence to gain a sexual advantage within their own gender and second the need to rid the palaeolithic tribal band of all genetic undesirables. Remember when the  year old girls would shamelessly point their fingers in unison at the undesirable lowranking boy and scream Euwww gross!!? First and foremost they were starting to learn how to deal with their feelings of innate revulsion for having beta splooge touch their ovaries and secondly they served the palaeolithic tribal bands need to rid itself of the weak. It is this second mechanism which I believe is at work when the female loses all interest and any appreciation of value in an exmate  the level of vindictiveness the level of selfdisgust are the necessary precursors to expunging the male from the tribe for being a low value deformed blind and deaf cripple.,TheRedPill,crctpl8,2,t5_2ve1u

4007842,0,t3_36dhaj,We are reward machines. Morality is a bargaining tool a way we can psychologically reward ourselves for having selfrestraint for gesturing towards altruism. If someone finds more reward for being killed by an axewielding psycho than for killing him in selfdefense because they find fighting immoral  such a person might have more utility and reward for martyring themselves than for harming another person. An extreme case yes but not far from what many moral people do and rationalize as just action.Far better is to examine sociology to determine the kind of action you can take that minimizes your selfish footprint without allowing others to step on you and this is what many TRPers are in fact trying to do. My blue pill friend recently relayed a story to me of how hell spend time with a woman go over to her house to watch movies grab dinner play cards talk about life fix stuff for her sleep at her house but not fuck her  because shes been hurt too many times when a friendship turned into a relationship and he doesnt want to put her in that position. For my buddy hes getting a psychic charge from feeling like a gentleman for having selfrestraint for being moral but in reality hes misreading the fact that hes being exploited and used by this woman who is getting his time and energy for free.Morality is about our relationship with other people in the context of our personal desires. TRP recognizes that women often want men to treat them immorally they prove this repeatedly with how they reward men with what kind of men get pussy. You can choose to be moral and pass up on what women want but you are deluding yourself in the process and thus decidedly bluepill.,TheRedPill,crd4hme,-2,t5_2ve1u
4007883,0,t3_36dhaj,Great read. I would argue against your interpretation of Neitche. In Beyond Good and Evil he goes into great depth on the moral perceptions of man an oversimplification of the master morality would lead the unprepared to believe their ability can overcome the consequences of immoral actions. In the modern context this brlief is the incarnation of Nitches last man a pleasure seeking idiot but a confident idiot. The idea of the master morality forging principles beyond the subjective chains of good and evil are cemented in motivations beyond the scope of that primitive foundation and sure as shit beyond getting your dick wet.The common moral framework that until very recently ubiquitous in the West  is centered around the advancement of society as a whole. Its cooperative game theory where participants agree to a mutually beneficial strategy for best outcomes. This social contract IS civilization. A self interested person can take a dominate strategy at others expense in legal circumstances. In a culturally homogenous environment this persons behaviour is deemed immoral and heshe suffers from a loss of reputation avoidence and eventually exclusion. When thus framework breaks down everyone is forced to adopt a protective strategy at considerable cost both direct cost and opportunity cost. Civil discource has lost its enforcement mechanism and the multicult reigns supreme. Unless and until there is a dramatic shift nothing is going to change.At an individual level however ingroup reputation is still paramount. Shit behaviour is still shit behaviour itll catch up to you in unexpected ways. ,TheRedPill,crd4nnu,1,t5_2ve1u

I will just add one bit you say that a man modifies his behaviour according to who he is interacting with the level of trust etc. Ok but there is one man that I always interact with  myself. So there are some moral behaviours that dont change no matter the external circumstance because in the end I still need to live with myself even if others come and go. Marcus Aurelius I think it was talked about circles with yourself in the centre then your family then fellow citizens then your countrymen then all of humanity. He acknowledged that there were differences in how we interact with these different rings but also decided to pull each inward  ie to treat your family as yourself your fellow citizens as your family etc.As for sleeping with another mans wife I admit that I did that although I didnt know she was married at the time she didnt wear a ring and never mentioned him.

Try to resist the calls of your ego in setting these up. . If youre anal about people following an equitable living DO NOT GET ROOMMATES.

Remember that if these people dont really care about these things you cannot enforce anything really. You have no threat to make them do things. Fortunately with most men you CAN talk it out. If theyre not unreasonable theyll listen.    . Make this an agreement before you move in. Convey your expectations. If they dont stick to them harsh way to find out who is a bad friend.    . At any point if you think this is straining your relationship with these people determine which one you want more  the friendship or the structure youre trying to get them to stick to.

Were much smarter then generations of past thanks to the internet and the sheer amount of information were absorbing on a daily basis. New ideals and a new collective male perspective are forming not just here on TRP but all around things inherent to the male perspective are becoming reality in the physical world. That means this ideation that we shouldnt economically castrate our relationships personal economy for pussy from degenerate females whore severely intellectually deficient is becoming a new thing. However this is still a minority opinion as most men are still plugged into Gynocentrism pussy worship etc. Doesnt help societys given most men a false framework of the world one where we here  are jail breaked however there is still much work to be done to unplug the rest of the slaves whore plugged into Gynocentrism. ,TheRedPill,cri4ezh,1,t5_2ve1u

I offer low paying internships where women can fuck me and spend a few hours at my place displaying her traits a few days out of the week.  If they complain about that or perform poorly then they are not fit for the full time position.  I would rather have the full time position open anyways since many interns can fulfill the duties of that job for a much lower pay. This is much more lucrative for my company and beats having to go through all of the paperwork of creating monogamous contracts.Me Enterprise is always growing acquiring new skills developing  and catching the interest of more and more people.  The value of Me Enterprise is always increasing. Should a woman display motivation and traits that would help this company progress forward  then she may be a good candidate for the LTR position.  This position is not permanent however as any sign of a feeble attempt to stray away from the companys mission will result in a demotion or at worst being fired permanently.  LTRs are not something that you should be seeking.  They are nothing but maintenance of a plate that has proved herself worthy of an LTR.  Women date up. Women need men.  Finding an LTR is about being a high enough value man but dont waste time and energy trying to negotiate to her that you are worth more than sex because it should ultimately be vice versa.  ,TheRedPill,crno3lg,7,t5_2ve1u

Its real easy to say I did not have my phenibut so I wasnt in the zone. Thats why I couldnt pull that girl from the bar and start making excuses. The ONLY thing required to get laid is your cock. People who rely on external substances to overcome their doubts or internal inhibitors are weakening their will power muscles and will have a harder time learning game when they dont have access to their phenibut or whatever they take. Its like a body builder not being able to achieve his pump as well when he doesnt have access to steroids.

They HATE it when that is said so baldly but once theyve gotten sexually empowered they hate the idea of any kind of sexual relationship with the sort of beta men that their feminism demands men be.I can say the most misogynistic things to them but because of amused mastery the result is typically an immediate and evident increase in attraction such as literally jumping me for sex or simply planting a promising wet kiss on me. Just the other night I explained to a plate in a couple short sentences womens dualistic sexual strategy AFBB. She thought for a second and just said huh yeah. You think so?  not in a challenging way  but in that confirm this for me sort of way. Then she snuggled up and basically asked if I was going to fuck her now. But shell get all up on The Patriarchy if given a chance  and once I told her I am your Patriarchy  Getting her to call me Daddy? Well thats standard now. Note I know explaining anything RP to a woman is risky. Hell its bad enough talking with a BP man about it.

In fact newly married women who were found to not be virgins were stoned to death in the old testament. Whats truly valuable to an individual man is that an individual woman will have HIS children.A good growing society values women for reproduction and chastity as a whole but thats because society needs growth and production. If you stop valuing the reproduction that stems from women our numbers dwindle and start dieing out If you stop valuing chastity the production that stems from men ends and society collapses in upon itself.Im thinking that is where your confusion stems from.

It is a concept about motivation about what makes a person keep going. It can be summarized in one picture however Id like to give an explanation.If you never let your son win he will give up. There should be a tangible goal to aim for not some random to beat my father especially if there isnt the slightest of understanding how to and where to even start. This is where good teaching comes into play a decent mentor can keep a person in the flow so his scholar will be incredibly motivated without even noticing.When the best leaders work is done the people say We did it ourselves.  Lao TzuIm not saying you should let your pupil win continuously or occasionally but he should see the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. There should be smaller tasks to achieve. Understanding the Why is the reason one can rearrange his own knowledge bits into new patterns. It is the difference between mindless operating like a machine and being an intelligent human being. Understanding the whys is difficult for any task and requires some kind of mentor.,TheRedPill,crxw152,17,t5_2ve1u

Its like having the library of Alexandria in your house yes theres sand and gravel to sift through to find the gold but information can be found on any topic without having centralized institutions filtering out what you can and cannot learnreadhear. I can get a college degree right now without leaving my house.This sub is a testament to the benefits of the internets group consciousness. Its taken the fragments of observations from thousands of people and banded them together to create one big picture which everyone can see. No matter the topic everything is being exposed to more and more sunlight fewer shadows and places to hide. The music sucksis great from every era. Films today suckare great. If you dont like todays music you can listen to yesterdays. If you dont like that listen to last weeks. You can have it all wherever and whenever you want. In the s I saw Star Wars in the theatre. Then it was gone and didnt show up again until almost a decade later when VHS technology put a movie rental store in my neighbourhood. Thats how it was then most films disappeared forever once they were out of the theatres. Occasional flicks ended up on television years after their release. Back then if you wanted to hear a song you could phone your radio station and request it or you could by it in a record store. There were no iPods no cell phones no way to carry around what you wanted when you wanted it. Did the s music suck? Great then rip a bunch of s tunes and carry a thousand of them around in your pocket. Todays civilization may seem like its going down the toilet but its not. Its a temporary lapse due to the overwhelming technological leaps were dealing with. The technology jumps from late s to now far surpass the Industrial Revolution and echo flourishes of mass production and radio and television broadcasting. Most cant see that right now because theyre in the middle of it. Carefree behaviour is unconscious behaviour. Its doing things probably fun but without selfawareness.

They are damaged goods and we refuse to associate with them or with their families. Most of these woman prostitutes simply do not realize that their value in their line of work decreases day by day and most get knocked up by some low life loser with a similarly nauseating upbringing and rotten heredity.

It is not men who enforced the sexual mores of patriacharchies it was always women.The difference between a traditionalist matriarch and a feminista is that the former carefully instructed her daughters how to properly snare a drafthorse and how to properly feed it and keep it in good health whereas feministas will first deny that they need a drafthorse and then get the state to whip it bloody so that it still pulls the plough.

4322497,0,t3_3af9cz,apparently the mods of TRP are so sensitive that one cannot question orthodoxy even when it is done by the positing of a philosophical question based on observations of Marcus Aurelius. Instead what I regarded as stimulating debate on an important issue which seems to have interested a considerable number of TRP was branded trolling and punished with a day ban.MODS are trigger happy no denying it but its for a purpose TRP is the only island of sanity for men in an insane world. If someone lands here and reads too many dissenting opinions they might think this place is also hit by the storm when in fact its a tropical paradise for the mind. See what Im getting to ? Theres value in orthodoxy theres a reason for it.Now as for morals.You seem to adopt the point of view that sleeping with another mans wive is inherently BAD then argue around that. Why is that ? Homosexuality used to be a crime and a disease and now its perfectly acceptable even encouraged. Why ? How could it go from BAD to GOOD if its inherently ANYTHING ? As a child I invented a thought experiment to destroy my vision of good and evil.Two soldiers from opposing towns during antiquity are fighting over a river. Whoever gets the river can cut off his enemys water supply and prosper at the same time. The other town will suffer and die.They are both good men both married both have two kids a boy and a girl. Yet one of them is going to kill the other and then cause his family to starve or be sold as slaves. Evil ? Or good for saving his own family from the same fate ? What you got to understand is that as NOBLE as this notion of do no harm and the intellectual mish mash that grew out of it which we call doing good or morality is it is an illusion. A negotiated code of behavior among people who peragree to follow it. It has no basis in anything unless you make up a magic man in the sky to be enforcer of the rules YOU came up with.

4364295,0,t3_3ayldh,I can agree with everything you said for most games. But games that you cant beat require an immense amount of effort to be one of the best. Games like CSGO TF Starcraft DOTA. When I say these games cant be beat I mean there is ALWAYS something you can improve on and the multiplayer aspect introduces actual opponents which dramatically increases the skill ceiling. If you play single player games yeah eventually the game becomes easy because you get good enough to beat the bots but you will NEVER reach the point of being so good that there is no one near your level if you want to be the best you have to constantly be sharpening yourself. These games also have leagues that have huge prize pots huge tournament finals with massive crowds. Being good at the game isnt enough you need to be able to communicate and work well with  or  other people in a stressful environment. Theres a whole world out there and you seem to be ignorant either that or youve grown sour from your inability to game responsibly. Instead of campaigning against gaming perhaps you should start campaigning for not being a fat slob. And if you think being a pro gamer doesnt get your dick sucked youd be sorely mistaken.

4417543,0,t3_3bmr5l,Your argument is flawed. If you believe in a higher being who sets your destiny then that same higher being can set your destiny to not have the one. That same higher being can set your destiny to be mowed down mindlessly together with another million people. I think the idea of the one true love is an impossibility for a different reason. Love is an emotion a very fickle emotion. If your entire worth is dependant on some fickle emotion of your spouse..... I guess you get a very high divorce rate as a result. The marriages of yesteryear were about commitment family finances parenting and a host of other practical things. If all worked out well you hoped to have that fuelled by some love as well. If the love aspect didnt pan out there was always a discreet affair to have.The idea of having an other half is something discussed and debated in religious texts. My understanding of these debates is that it has nothing at all to do with love. Of course different religions will preach different things. So if you came across a religion which places love as the foundation for a marriage I wouldnt be at all surprised to find a high divorce rate within that religious community for the reasons mentioned above. ,TheRedPill,csnlb9a,3,t5_2ve1u

They have more expensive taste than marrying Larry the cable guy or plumber Joe there was a section on this in The Manipulated Man by Esther Villar. Its a great readIve had an ex openly tell me that she would not work if I met my goal of making k a year. You can bet she was fully supportive of everything I have done with regard to professional development.If your end game is that why push yourself until you contemplate suicide for a STEM degree when you can take something easy where you just puke up the last chapter on exam day?Women do not want a career they want a man with a career. They want a beta provider to buy them all the expensive clothes fancy cars and new tits after they hit the wall so they can keep cheating on you with Chad Thundercock. Either that or divorce your ass and take everything she can from what you spent your life building. If she could take your education she would probably take that too.Its not that men are smarter we just want the good life for ourselves and we are willing to work for it. There are women who are in fact willing to take on a changing career. My mother and sister are both engineers who did better in school than I did.Its quite common to see educated couples where the male makes a shit ton more than the woman.

4435569,0,t3_3br1ix,Awesome post! Thank you Id definitely like to point out that attention is actually in this case a service. Limited non repeat but a paid transaction for a service. To the old man this is like paying for the super bowl.Completely agree with you I dislike strip clubs unlike many of my acquaintances but Ive also been close friends with few strippers female and male.I would also like to add male strip clubs are just the same only instead of paying for female attention and a fake abundance rush its women paying for alpha only attention and their alpha fix. Question what are your thoughts on the escorts bracket? Instead of many youre only paying for one and often times not getting laid. Is it an amplification of the old guy in the story? Im curious as to your thoughts had an international escort as a plate at one time. I noticed her and her friends were all incredibly intelligent well versed in a multitude of topics able to converse in at least an adept level in almost anything you could think of. Maybe paying for attention without the boredom of idiocy? Additionally they rarely if ever screwed a client. The most RP women ive known in that regard it was a job and from what I heard screwing reduced comeback. It may be a going away gift when someone was getting married and their services would no longer be demanded but for someone whose a good client sex usually caused either problems attachment and the nasty things that followed or caused the client to leave looking for a newer fresher experience quickly.

Stayed away from girls and thought i would achieve something. I got moderate success.  Now i am desperate i cannot find girls that easily. I dont know where to. I am already average if i lose my age i am down to nothing. I cant even get girls who look average if not good.

Women do not care about male weakness and neither does society. If you are weak depressed small poor uneducated unconfident essentially anything which stops you from being powerful then nobody cares. People only care about you when youre powerful or a beautiful woman. You have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and rely on yourself because nobody else gives a fuck about you. Youre given a dichotomy sink or swim you sink then you end up drowning yourself in failure and selfpity. When you swim and start riding tidal waves thats when people start taking notice. Society will always have a safety net for women white knights will charge in other women will side with her because they share a gender and the state will provide welfare etc. As a man you have no such luxury your propensity and ability to gain power is much higher than a womans but your ability to hit rock bottom is far more pronounced too. As men we are more extreme than women are. Women are typically average and dont move much either side of the bell curve as men we are either highly successful geniuses of repute that feminists can but scoff and be jealous of the poster boys for their esteemed patriarchy or were the invisible voiceless povertystricken peasant class that nobody gives a flying fuck about.good article on this summary A plothole in your theory that if you were born a woman you would have so many passionate individuals trying to fulfull your fantasies is what if you were born an ugly female? Although most women can breeze through life on easy mode when they hit the wall age  there looks will fade and  of the benefits they once reached stop as a man your looks can always be offset by your status and your power and you can be the ugliest mofo but still marry a supermodel if you become successful.

Women need men more than men need women. Men generally speaking want sex and at some point in their lives perhaps a family so that they continue their genetic lineage. Women however need men for their rational minds and stoic consistency. Women need men to emotionally stabilise them and be the rock in her storm as well as serve as a conduit which allows her to feel complete.

4534978,0,t1_ct27dlj,Thats a good point for us to consider.   But how is it shallow?  Its about being able to be proud of who you are and what you are in the community.  If youre a member of a  community you already occupy a position in the community.  Youre already the guy who lives there on that street who does that as a profession has that as a hobby and has those as his skills.  Youre the guy who went to that school has those friends took that program traveled to those locations and made those accomplishments. So its just a question of whether youre proud of yourself or embarrassed.  If youre not happy with it you could just say fuck the community but that would be going your own way from the community.You already probably have a lot of things from the list above that you could announce about yourself to the community.  So I guess what Im saying is women are sort of community refs that help keep score of the game of life.  But having your own ref will help you win at the game because they help remind you that youre still in it.Otherwise we men tend to forget there is a game and if we dont have someone to remind us we run the risk of getting run over and run off the road by all the other people who are still in the game.,TheRedPill,ct29lpm,1,t5_2ve1u

4615569,0,t3_3e7o76,. If you intend to just fuck her casually then its not necessary save for STDs and stuff.. If you want a relationship then its important. Think of each one of her notches as an extra dick you have to fight your way into her pussy which sucks. To top that she being solipsistic will construct her reality to favor her which also means that all ex chads were so much more exciting and youre just a weaselly dweeb who barely knows how to stick his dick inside her. Im not saying this is true but she will interpret it as such no matter how alpha you are. Your degree of alphaness can only curtail her alpha widowness It cant eliminate it.What youre trying to do here is most probably find a glimmer of hope for your own desires and fulfillment in terms of female intimacy. But first that is just an illusion  She cant love you the way you love her and hers is contingent on opportunity and her own schedules and compulsions. Second you will have to confront this and face your own nihilistic demons. My take on this differs from a lot of guys here  I think emotional fulfillment with women is possible just not in the way we were indoctrinated and so we should go about this in a more realistic way.So to summarize use redpill to do  things a Cleanse yourself of your old beliefs which are false and limiting eg . NAWALTb Build new beliefs and life paradigms which allow you more freedom and choice Plate spinningc Recreate your emotional system as to have expectations within the red pill context Such as accepting that any LTR will more likely have a higher notch count than you and until her late wall years will have more options  So peacekeeping and negotiating desire are poor strategies to manage something which is already volatile. So you can never find a permanent solution to this aka  the one and youll have to live with this.So the answer to your question is  Yes you should screen for the the girl not because you want to know if she has a high notch count but to determine if shes willing to make that long commitment and stick around when she hits her late years and pines for a missing alpha. A high notch count indicates that sex never was a big deal for her and is unlikely to be such in the future as well. And thus gt NEXT DAnd if you can dont marry. Prefer an MTR to an LTR. And fuck a lot of ugly girls as well  helps to reprogram yourself. Best of luck to you.,TheRedPill,ctcde69,1,t5_2ve1u

4672835,1,t3_3eyern,The hardest problem for many men is accepting that there is a pronounced and irreparable intellectual divide between ALL men and ALL women there are no exceptions. Women are capable of rote memorization but they lack the capacity to digest and comprehend ANY of the words and concepts that they memorize. There are an infinite amount of studies that attest that women arent capable of any kind of spatial relationship mastery  which is indicative that they possess no substantive depth of thought and that they can only grasp things in two dimensions.  It is only after swallowing the red pill that a man truly knows what hes up against which is sadly a retarded vagina.  Secretly all men understand how dangerous it is to arm a retarded vagina with any modicum of power or responsibility but only redpill men have the courage to brave the backlash that comes from publicly standing against the grain of feminism.  It sounds hateful to the uninitiated to hold females down to their lowered designated roles but its the kindest gesture a man can do. Most men refuse to see the forest for the trees and continue to ascribe all of the rights and expectations of human personhood and agency to the retarded vagina and then slowly simmer with rage when the retarded orifice inevitably lets them down. Time for your medicine bloopers. Reality is quite literally a stupid bitch but willful blindness will surely be your demise.  You dont have to insult your own intelligence any longer by treating females like men. Theyre so tired of pretending to keep up and they so desperately want the security of hiding under your boot heel.

I live in a pretty liberal city and am currently on a trip across the mid west. OMG the wonder that is conservative white culture when it comes to resisting feminism. The women arent as attractive but you can just tell they all approach their men in a mature respectful manner. I am considering moving south for weather reasons but this trip is making mind up. Conservative culture is great for men and when men are happy they make their women happy. I am one of those guys who is suicidal because of all the feminism I was exposed to as a kid the fact my dad got bitched up by my mom because of predatory divorce laws and domestic violence laws and finally when my dad broke mentally and he got entrapped into an fbi sting and was sent to jail for  years for meeting a minor its usually  years but he was a community leader and it was an election year so they threw the book at him. I am not condoning what he did I am just showing how feminism has destroyed my life and I dont really see any other options than getting as far away from it as possible. Feminism is the death of the stoic male and ultimately will end our culture. The Midwest might be vanilla and boring but atleast the fuckin feminist havent destroyed it yet,TheRedPill,cts1hd1,4,t5_2ve1u

Otherwise the relationship stays open. The second that the relationship changes and Im not being fulfilled by it it is open again and if mistakes were made possibly ended altogether. As for traditional open relationships I just dont believe that you can be intimate with others while still being committed to someone. Those two ideas are just at opposite ends of the spectrum for me. The only thing that I can say about TRP for sure is that it boils down to do what makes you truly happiest.

4782420,0,t1_ctxbxlt,If they nonchalantly swatted down the challenge verbally while making you laugh your opinion of them would go up ie they would pass your shit test.  Like I said the shit test is an instinctual social interaction utilized by humans to establish and reinforce social hierarchies they also serve as tests to demonstrate competence under stress something that is necessary for survival in a leader.  You cant avoid them they are part of how we interact shit tests are hard wired behaviors that have evolved because they work and help the functioning of the group.Where I think our disagreement originates is our philosophical understanding of man.  To be blunt I have concluded most people are delusional about how humans operate they have a mystical view of humanity that is divorced from our current understanding of reality science.  Humans are not a logical computers constantly thinking about all the stimulus their brain receives in order to make conscious decisions based on reason.  Humans are animals and primarily operate based on their instincts most of a humans decision making is done unconsciously it needs to be done this way because we need to operate efficiently nor could the past K years suddenly wipe out the vast majority of evolved nervous system functionality that has been over  million years in the making when it comes to the tetrapod brain.Now clearly we arent all instincts we clearly have mental properties making us very special and separable from other animals.  I argue humans have two amazing abilities  First we have language which allows us to compartmentalize and associatively understand concepts and observations and share these ideas with other humans secondly we are capable of meta cognition we can think about thinking and think about possible actions themselves on a very deep level.  The combined use of an organized language and meta cognition allows our conscious minds to take over our actions and supersede reflexive and instinctive behaviors but make no mistake Your conscious mind is the disassociated observer your instincts have a much larger impact on what you do moment to moment.  Moment to moment you are compelled to shit test other humans you interact with again to establish and reinforce the social hierarchy as well as to test for competency  especially in leaders unless you are socially retarded in some aspect such as autism your hard wired neurology will compel you to do so and your conscious mind will not even notice.  Shit testing is part of healthy human behavior.,TheRedPill,ctxd4hc,1,t5_2ve1u

4800630,0,t1_ctzm7o2,It matters because it is a faulty strategy and the majority of posts in this thread are defending his good action but overlooking months of bad ones. I completely agree his response to being rejected is the best response. Im not saying hes an asshole for ending the friendship Im saying hes an asshole because the evidence points to him only ending the relationship because he didnt get what he wanted out of it which means he used friendship as a camouflage for his real intentions. If a man did this to another man we would call him a manipulative bitch or an asshole.We can see from the post that the friendship seemed to be massively one sided. Why didnt he end it sooner? If cutting her off was simply a response to realizing how one sided the relationship was he wouldve done it a lot sooner and in that case we wouldnt be discussing it because he wouldve handled the situation like a man from beginning to end. That isnt what happened though. He continued the friendship in hopes to win her over despite the fact that it was one sided. In the end he made the best move possible but it likely did not occur for the right reasons considering he only made this move after he was rejected. Hes an asshole unintentionally or not. Not because he stopped giving this entitled girl the special treatment that she feels she deserves but because he gave her special treatment under the guise of friendship. Hopefully this situation wakes him up and clues him into the fact that doing favors for people will not get you what you want and that he should be upfront with his desires so as to not waste his resources on dead ends.,TheRedPill,ctznqkj,0,t5_2ve1u

This seems more like your opinion on Nazism the merit of which has nothing to do with my point.Heres what I think Being alpha has nothing to do with ethics that would be moralistic. It has nothing to do with how your fellow men perceive you that would be second handing. It has everything to do with fulfilling your personal potential to paint your will on the fabric of the world if you must.

When walking into people avoid changing your path stand your ground and make the person who didnt pay attention to change their path. I love doing this. No more shuffling between me and another person about who makes way for who. . My favorite practice biting your lower lip in a seductive yet fun fashion. Get over your shyness and look in the mirror and PRACTICE! Dont overbite I would say only  of your lower lip should be bit. Biting your whole damn lower lip looks ridiculous...ANYWAYS This helps you demonstrate that you are sexual and know how to have fun. I love doing this right after I say something suggestive or has a double entendre she will be so turned on. BONUS POINTS If youre feeling extra ALPHA raise your eye brows after the suggestion.

4920434,0,t3_3i9k4t,The article theyre debating is a JOKE.gtAccording to the surveys married women reported they were less satisfied with the quality of their relationships than married men were. In contrast women and men in nonmarital relationships reported similar levels of relationship quality Rosenfeld found.gtIts possible that women report lower levels because they experience heterosexual marriage as constraining oppressive uncomfortable and controlling Rosenfeld said.gtResearchers have examined the unequal power dynamic present in many American heterosexual marriages. For instance American women are usually younger than their husbands earn less money and often take their husbands last name Rosenfeld said.Again with the feminist crap.  Men being more attracted to younger women and vice versa is basic biology that is the most fundamentally important type of attraction for the survival of our species. No amount of feminism government regulations or shaming can ever override that fact.  If making less money was one of the reasons then why is it that the rate at which women initiate divorces shoot up from  to  when we start talking about college educated couples? Source  So that leaves  taking your last name as the only possible valid reason listed. And even that makes little sense. Apparently voluntarily changing her last name to yours is constraining oppressive uncomfortable and controlling and is why women initiate upwards of  of divorces.  I dont think so.  Here are what some of the women from the survey said about why they initiated divorcegtI wasnt in love with him anymore he was selfish immature. I was ready to move on and find better love.Translation He reminded me of a little boy instead of a man.  Little boys dont give me tingles alphas do.gtI used to be a very happy optimistic person and it was like he was slowly starving my soul. I didnt like the way he treated me and finally realized that he was abusive. I didnt know that such a thing existed until I researched it. Once I realized what was going on was abuse I started the proceedings for a divorce.Translation He would break frame constantly and men who break frame dry me up faster than the Sahara Desert.gtThe reasons behind each breakup are intriguing but it will take a study with far greater depth of information than this one to fully understand why women are less satisfied in marriage than men are Rosenfeld said in the study.No it wont someone tell this guy to read the sidebar bruh.

4959892,0,t3_3ip7vv,Something I learned is that its not about the particular women. Its about the feelings you have of hooking up with her. That is what a man needs to focus on. Because if you focus on her then its a very narrow view point. You trick your mind into believing only her can provide those feelings. Well when you start hooking up with more and more women you begin to see that it was not a particular women but how it felt to be hooking up with women. It feels good and should be a motivator to find more women who you can hook up with. It stops being about the women who arent helping you achieve these good feelings but the ones who are and willing to do so repeatedly. So it helps when your out looking for women because your only looking for ones who you are attracted to and are willing to provide these feelings that you love about hooking up. It makes it so much easier to walk away when its not happening. Focusing on one particular women is the Disney fantasy. Focusing on how hooking up makes you feel is the fantasy that is possible. You just need to find women who make it possible. ,TheRedPill,cujqfci,3,t5_2ve1u

You want to convince of that. It is kind of like how you would pass a shittest in that you would dismiss the worries of a girl who might be afraid that having sex on the first date makes her a slut.  ,TheRedPill,cukj55t,130,t5_2ve1u

So rather then diet why not get educated on nutrition?Processed foods sugars wheat dairy etc its all having negative effects on you internally aswell as on the outside.Cant sleep? Cant shit? Low energy etc? Its the food youre eating.I started dieting to get cut in AprilMay I was doing x  hour fasts a week. And I trained on it. I felt like shit. I came to the conclusion diets do not work.I read a book about the power of visualization and the power of your brain etc. To transform.Since then my diet and body has changed.I pretty much eatBreakfastLunch Midday A green juicesmoothie with mixed organic vegetables e.g.  bean chili sweet potato greek salad and supergeen salad. I eat this x a week.Snacks BananamangoDinner Mixed salad with avocado and a lean piece of meat e.g. steak chicken etc. Late snacks More fruit e.g. grapes and a probiotic.Now I do cheat. But whenever I want.  Not to be too graphic here but I am going to the toilet ALOT. Like when I was a kid I had a fast mentabolism.So essentially I need to cheat because I am human however I dont crave it as much but if I do I dont feel guilty about it as  I know  of my diet is absolutely clean and healthy.I should note that I do train and lift weights aswell. So just do what works for you. I even go vegeterian  days a week just for my digestion. But thats just what works for me.,TheRedPill,cumxzp4,0,t5_2ve1u

Once they have their armies in place theyll probably finish the job.Youre confusing society and genetics.Hypergamy is part of the genetic programming for sexually dimorphic species. Its part of natural selection and is determined by your genes not by whatever society you live in.Secondly a great number of societies  particularly large successful empires  have passed laws to force the creation of pair bonds and to punish hypergamy and branch swinging.For instance in several countries in the Middle East there are special branches of religious police who are there to enforce religious law.Things like adultery or premaritalsex are very harshly punished in those countries. Women have been lashed in public stoned to death by crowds with rocks been beheaded in the central square or been thrown in really nasty prisons.In some cases womens own families will murder them at home after finding out they were having premaritalsex in order to keep the blow to the family honor secret.These arent isolated incidents. Theyve happened hundreds of thousands of times over the past few decades.So the moral of the story is even if you had religious police patrolling the streets and arresting suspected adulterers and women suspected of hypergamy and branchswinging you would still have hundreds of thousands of women getting ready to be hypergamous.Why? Because its genetically hardcoded into our species. Its not a bug or a mistake. Its a feature and it isnt going away. Ever.So if youre really interested in sexual strategy  like this subreddit is supposed to be about  then youll realize that whining about hypergamy is pointless and counterproductive.,TheRedPill,cuvvlkr,1,t5_2ve1u

His words will carry more weight because of this respect and people will listen. His power and potential success within society will far outshine the criminal alpha. This power and success acquired with the approval of the group will put him in a position to enjoy the finest of females.Its up to you to calibrate your own moral compass.

I love the conversations I have with these girls that are trying to reach for career success and all they talk about is money and social gatherings the ingroup gatherings of other wealthy recent college grads. The entitlement and arrogance is so astounding. You would think they were born royalty yet they got a betterthanaverage job out of school and are on the hunt for guys in the same boat. The problem is most of those guys just studied their asses off in school and didnt develop a well rounded character. They werent risk takers and they landed good jobs through following the grove and trusting it would provide them a solid future. It did but most arent super RP.

Of course there are some skillsets and talents women CAN acquire that would boost their value and not place it almost exclusively on their vagina but beta orbiters and the feminist propaganda perpetuated by the media and SJW run society have caused for women western in particular to be extremely over entitled to the point where they believe their very presence not even sex alone is enough for them to be worthy of receiving attention validation and a comfortable lifestyle at the expense of someone else.     This is an extremely pathetic way to live life women are essentially parasites if you think about it and the advent of sexbots will significantly undermine the amount of control their vaginas have on society.

5157801,0,t1_cv72rxi,Thanks for this post it really highlights a lot of the communication issues I have with other men. I was raised to be a supplicating chump byfor women so I have their social communcation style down pat unfortunately.A question about the final paragraphs of your postgtProblems arise between the sexes when people seek bonding across the gender divide. When a man asks a woman for advice she tries to empathize that sucks... and begins to see him as weak when he becomes more frustrated why isnt she helping?. When he tries to challenge her opinions in order to understand her values she becomes defensive because she considers it an attack and he considers her too sensitive.gtWhen a woman shares her problems with a man she is looking for support and is instead given advice to fix the problem why wont he just listen! while the man is confused because his version of supportive advice was rejected why did she even ask?.For the first Is this to say that men simply ought not to ask a woman for advice? Or should we just outwardly appreciate what little women have to offer if we do ask and they got nothing for us?For the second I think most men who have needed TRP are already very skilled at listening and supporting when a woman talks about her problems. Providing comfort is necessary to maintain a relationship but how do you make sure not to do it too much like most of us have done before? That is how do you decide when to choose not to provide the feminine support that women unknowingly seek? Or do you just condition her not to ask?,TheRedPill,cv7ph2d,3,t5_2ve1u

5165563,0,t1_cv8miq9,Well it works for us. The ability and willingness to communicate. Often not communicating makes other problems in a relationship worse. This is a fundamental thing that my uncle who is a psychiatrist often comes across whether he is dealing with couples children and their parents or whatever the inability to calmly communicate. Now sometimes communication is not enough sometimes there will be other issues like infidelity or alcoholism but again problems that can be helped or prevented by communication. Infidelity often occurs because a couple grow distant from one another because communication that is why my parents became divorced and something my dad learned when he remarried my dad and stepmom.have had a strong marriage for more than a decade. If course he will tell you that he never stopped courting my stepmom they make an effort to always do something new each Sunday evening whether its a movie or going to a museum or an art gallery. Most problems in a relationship whether it is between a couple or a parent and their child can begin to be solved through communication and then the willingness to solve the issue through action.

I suffer quite badly when running or playing sports on hard surfaces and my brother dislocated his knees almost  times. Yet I have never had any problems squatting. It is a mechanically efficient movement for the knees.Obviously its impossible to diagnose whats wrong remotely but I would suggest looking at the angle of your knees when you squat. They should be pointing outwards slightly as should your feet rather than straight forward. Starting Strength covers this well. Failing that perhaps you are triggering the upward phase of the squat incorrectly by pushing down against the floor from the knees when you should rather be pulling yourself upwards by your arse as if there were a pulley attached to your coccyx pulling directly upwards again read Starting Strength.

5170983,0,t3_3lm9uj,I think I can explain this a little better now that Ive had time to think about it. Think of the poet e.e. cummings. He knows the rules of grammar and punctuation. He learned the rules and internalized them. Once he learned the rules he practiced. He had natural talent and improved on what God gave him. After a while he decided to break the rules and write poetry the way he wanted to. He stopped using capital letters and he started doing weird shit with punctuation. He became a famous poet successful in his own time still read today and taught in school. Most of his contemporaries followed the generally accepted rules of poetry at the time and few of them are remembered as well as cummings. He was such a badass that he changed poetry to fit what he wanted  and didnt change himself to fit the rules of poetry. The divide I see developing in TRP is between the guys who believe that the rules themselves are God. They are like Autistic robots  input goes in sex comes out. But for the best of us we slowly learn that there is an art to all of this. The best of us arent nice guys but we are good men. There is a huge difference between those two things in that good men dont take shit but nice guys do. The robotic method of inputting certain behaviors and getting pussy back as an output  that works. But my method similar to OPs method works too and I believe it is superior. I believe it is superior because I feel better about myself Im friends with most of my exes and I can still get plenty of high quality women. I dont have any crazy bitch drama ever. OP offers a method that works. If you choose an alternate method more power to you but there is no need to pick apart the OPs method in a nonconstructive way or start calling people pussies. ,TheRedPill,cv9al3n,3,t5_2ve1u

5208377,0,t3_3lnrnv,I agree with a lot of the things on TRP but not this.  I like video games.  I have been playing video games for a long time.  When my cousins were out joining gangs and selling dope I was inside playing video games having a great time.  When my cousins got arrested for selling dope I was inside playing video games.  When my cousins met girls who liked bad boys I was inside playing video games.  When my cousins got these girls pregnant and now had more kids than they could take care of I was inside playing video games.  Now I am working towards finishing my degree while playing video games while enjoying single life without kids or any other serious obligations.  I like playing video games and it has been decent motivation to not get inoto any serious trouble.Some guys like to watch sports read or go drinking.  I dont drink or watch sports but those two activities fall into the same category as video games theyre time wasters.  Playing video games requires focus and its thrilling.  Watching sports is a passive activity.  Youre watching someone else put in effort.  In a family of very overweight men I am the only one who doesnt watch sports but is in good shape due to eating right and exercising.  Drinking is active but it has no benefits.  I understand people drink for various reasons but I see no point in going to a bar to dull my senses and listen to someone talk that I dont even enjoy being around. Every now and then Ill go to a bar to meet women with no end goal in mind. Sometimes I meet nice women sometimes I dont.  Some times I have a great laugh and others time I dont get to talk to anyone.  Whatever happens I have a glass of water in my hand.Before anyone says Im blind to the realities of life due to playing video games Im not.  I work in a hospital and see the realities very clearly on a daily basis.  I see the realities when I read the news see how people are treated depending on their social standing myself included.I used to be extremely overweight with no direcion in life then I cleaned up my act and then I became more selfaware about life.  I am a high status male because I play video games and dont care what other people think about my video game habits.  Im a high status male because I have sharp focus with a good goal in mind.  I am a high status male because I dont worry about whether or not shell like me.  I love who I am and thats all that matters. Thats high status. ,TheRedPill,cvdsvdk,1,t5_2ve1u

5230742,0,t1_cvg64sp,No problem.That sentence wasnt very well crafted.gt In the end Heidegger believed that the Third Reich failed to free itself and Europe from the pincers of Soviet and AngloSaxon materialism. The necessities of rearmament and war forced a rapprochement with big business and heavy industry thus Germany fell into the trammels of global technological materialism even as she tried to resist it.gt Heidegger was not however a Luddite. He was not opposed to technology per se but to what he called the essence of technology which is not technology itself but a way of seeing ourselves and the world the world as a stockpile of resources available for human use a world in which there are no limits in principle to human knowledge or power. This worldview is incompatible with any sort of mystery including the mystery of our origins or destiny. It is a denial of human differentiation  the differentiation that comes from multiple roots and multiple destinies.gt Yet as Heidegger slyly pointed out the very idea we can understand and control everything is not something we can understand or control. We dont understand why we think we can understand everything. And we are literally enthralled by the idea that we can control everything. But once we recognize this the spell is broken we are free to return to who we alwaysalready are and destined to be.gt But on Heideggers own terms it is still possible to combine a technological civilization with an archaic value system to reject the essence of technology and affirm rootedness and differentiation. This is what Guillaume Faye calls archeofuturism..Abstract concepts like controlling climate changes through mankinds intervention is this idea that man can rule nature simply by having good intentions towards a favorable outcome.  In the mythical progressive world its more important to feel good about your intentions about control than to actually have objective control.Progressives erase mystery and substitute myth as a placeholder. climate change obsessionsThe climate cycles through Ice Ages and warm periods naturally and it has done so for millions of years.  Based on past climate cycles we are on comfortable territory as far as temperature but CO is slightly higher than average for past cycles. trueDuring the age of the dinosaurs the CO levels were ten times higher than today.So objectively CO is a nonissue...  but for virtue signalling progressives they erase mystery and substitute myth so we are to believe the myth of impending doom if we dont limit CO.Thats pretty much how things operate these days myth pushes out mystery.  Genuine seeking of the mysteries of existence is replaced by prepackaged emotional indoctrination myths.  The progressive might sayWhy treat things as a mystery when we can declare our version of reality through myth?Why bother with the Scientific Method that elevates the importance of mystery and uncertainty when we can manufacture myths that make us feel good?.,TheRedPill,cvghumv,1,t5_2ve1u

Had a girl flirt with me for weeks I asked her out and she turned me down almost as if she wanted to see if she could pull my interest.  Throughout the weeks I never displayed any amount of interest in her and pretty much ignored her causing her to escalate her methods to even touching me and talking about wanting a boyfriend and so on.  But everything shattered when I asked her out it makes me think that if I approached her with an opportunity without making her think I actually liked her then she wouldve accepted the offer just for confirmation on the date and if I still manage to go through the date without showing too much interest she would probably try to get me in the bed to see if thats enough to win me over.Theres a difference between going nuclear and dread game.  Going nuclear would be Hey babe Im going out to fuck someone else.  and Dread game would be her indirectly finding out that youre going out to hang with some chick.  But she doesnt know if youre cheating she just knows you havent been giving her much attention and have been seeing other women.

5291128,1,t1_cvnzeuy,That simply is not true. Attorneys cant keep clients from settling. On the other hand they cant make them settle either.It is an attorneys job to make sure a client understands all of hisher options even those that are costly to pursue or not likely to have good results. An attorney is also required to advise what is the likely outcome but clients dont have to follow advice.It is true judges wont conserve property i.e. will force sales of property if the parties refuse to settle but wont pay to go forward but again thats on the husbandwife not the Court. They absolutely act in good faith. If they did not they are subject to malpractice and can be sued for actual damages and at times triple the damages as punitive measures. If attorneys were  as greedy as that movie suggests there would be an industry in suing divorce attorneys because it would have  the profits.That movie either intentionally or out of complete ignorance misallocates the source of the problems. The problems comes from one parties ability to abuse the others at the others expense. That is allowed by statute put into place by legislatures and not by attorneys or judges.As for your friends are attorneys expensive? Yes they are doctorate level professionals who bring a lot of expertise to serious issues. However most divorces could be resolved for a fraction of the total estate if the legislatures would address the issue i identified above or if both parties would be reasonable. This can admittedly be a problem as so many people live well beyond their means. If you have a home that is triple mortgaged and you are only paying interest youre likely to loose it all in paying at attorney to sort everything out so you dont loose everything in bankruptcy. But guess what if youre in triple mortgage you were never going to be able to keep it anyway.Unfortunately most divorces arent caused by feelings of goodwill. On maybe both are pissed at the other and perfectly ok in doing all in his or her power to make the other pay. ,TheRedPill,cvo04v7,-3,t5_2ve1u

You dont need to strengthen your neck  it holds your head up all day just fine. This frees the body up to fully express your internal state so even if youve done the work if youre fearful youre going to express fear. Get that abundance mentality down boys. Breathing is as easy as breathing into your ballstaintlegs  whatever image works for you. Your chest and shoulders dont really move when you breathe deeply like a baby.STRETCHMajor tension zones are hips shoulders neck and jaw. Always breathe into the places youre relaxing. . Standing allow your chin to fall to your chest then roll down your spine all the way to the waist one vertebrae at a time curling your spine like a cinnamon roll. Roll it back up stacking your vertebrae on top of each other one at a time so that your chin is the last thing to come up.. Sit crosslegged and stretch out over the center and then each knee. Put your feet together and grab your ankles not toes  keep breathing and allow your knees to sink to the floor. . Standing give yourself a big hug and breathe into your back  times. Reset the hug if your grip slips and do the same flopped over at the waist and again squatted down in between your haunches.. Allow your chin to fall to your chest breatherelax roll it to one side then the other. If you like to roll your hear all the way around LIFT IT IN THE BACK  DO NOT CRUNCH YOUR NECK. Think of lifting your chin rather than crunching your neck in the back.. Massage your jaw. You can find the sweet spot the socket where the lower mandible connects  its where we salivate or take the heels of your hand and run them down your face with your jaw open like the scream painting or your face is melting. When your jaw is fully relaxed you should be able to clasp your hands and do the shakeweight motion in front of you and have your jaw flop around loosely this can take weeks or months for some folks.RESONATORSYour voices resonates in your bones and cavities. Do these breathing deeply and without tensing up. As you move from low to high in your body the pitch will rise.

5323202,0,t1_cvr9b4t,gtIf Oprah ordered the assassination of all women who are higher on the SMV scale than she is would you all of a sudden get a raging hard on for Oprah? I hope not. You probably would get a boner for fat black cunts just not instantly. Its rather counterintuitive but there are real world examples to use as evidence. Prisons naval and merchant ships landbased army installations and oil rigs are all places where the local sexual market is highly skewed compared to the national or international sexual market. These are places where what we might agree are biologically straight men engage in gay sex engage in rape of male or female fuck way below their normal standards and engage in prostitution when normally they wouldnt.So no you wouldnt instantly get a hard on for Oprah. But after many years in prison guys start to turn fag. Maybe not their hardwired orientation but their behavior. They would still prefer to fuck a woman but without one available they will still get some release from gay sex.There are hundreds of years of jokes about sailors its not gay if youre underway. Likewise army guys stuck on installations in the middle of nowhere are known for fucking disgusting female creatures that normal respectable men in good shape with a full time job would never consider. How are they getting their dick hard if not by their lack of access to something better? Truckers lead lonely lives but are willing to put their dick into lot lizards. Even the name gives me the creeps. Again a guy located in a normal market wouldnt be able to get his dick hard for a lot lizard but truckers arent located in a normal market.In your hypothetical situation Oprah is the highest SMV around. Every other woman is fatter uglier disfigured etc. In this scenario some guys would turn inward and just become autoerotic chronic masturbators and porn users does porn exist in your hypothetical world?. Some guys would go gay or bend toward bisexual over time because it might be better for them to be with an attractive male than an obese cow. The beta followers would fall in line and fuck the fatties. How long do we have to live in this hell? Two weeks? Two months? Twenty years? Eventually there will be some movement between the groups. Guys who at first stuck to themselves and masturbation might turn gay for the sake of human affection. Some might start to find Oprah bangable though not LTR worthy.Over time there will be a new normal when the mental landscape experiences a reset. I have personally experienced this reset when I moved to Thailand. Most white guys that move to Asia and stay long term find that they are no longer attracted to white women. They are too fat entitled fat age poorly too sexually aggressive and too fat. But mostly fat.gtThe parameters on a scale were set by examples record holders. If Marylin Monroe was an  and in the future a mutation makes all women homelier would you argue that the hottest woman in the future with disfigurements is hotter than Marylin simply because the disfigured girl is the hottest of her kind? The standards have been set and all the women who come after either break that standard or fall somewhere under it.Standards dont get your dick wet. A guy can either act and react to the real world and its physical realities or he can stay in mental fantasy land. Hence why so many guys prefer porn to real women.

Remove women as a voting block and no liberal ever again wins office. It would literally be that simple. Ann Coulter did a piece on it a few years ago where she said shed give up her right to vote if all American women did the same just to keep republicans in office. This is not an endorsement of Coulter. Shes a hackfaced shrew who mindlessly votes for anything with an R after it.TRP is a sciencebased community that openly states more or less constantly that women are controlled by their feels rather than logic. Do we want wars because our representatives are feeling peevish? Do we want economic decisions based on what gives the best tingles? I certainly do not. One of my single largest complaints about liberalism is that it all falls to shit on one simple statement its not your fucking money. I dont care what it makes you feel to increase welfare spending you dont have the right to steal from me to do it. Women dont earn anything. Theyre given it by men. Thats why they embrace liberalism. Removing them from the voter rolls would be a net boon to society. Women voters are what is driving this nonsense about equality in the armed forces. Two women just faked their way into earning Ranger tabs. Women destroy morale in the military and get men good men killed as a result. And why are they there? Because leftists think theyll get more women votes if they push for making our combat arms into gender study experiments.

5370520,0,t1_cvxzsis,gt Why bother with realistic forms and personalities when you can literally create the girl of your dreams in VR or robot form?This is the insight this thread is looking for.When you take automation and a basic income and then grant everyone perfect virtual worlds they will step out of this one willingly.Real relationships between real people will become a rarity. Reproduction will decline and become a scientific endeavor. People who actually meet up and fuck will become a minority a kink a fetish a group of Luddites. A grossmessy affair.For those who dont think this is possible watch the movie Her and understand that AI will be that convincing in a very short amount of time.I think this will be devastating for women. Right now any man whos not a  needs to work on improving himself and learning to draw in the most attractive women or settling for suboptimal women who arent at their best and wont ever be.When the same guy can just collect a basic income sit at home lost in a fantasy world and have nonstop  action with any variable he wants in a convincing manner its over for women.Most men are beta including many who thump their chest here and work on TRP to land more pussy. Deep down they are lazy bastards who are only doing this to get laid. They arent in it for themselves.When they can plug their dick into a virtual reality theyll have enough to be happy. A perfect partner whos got none of the bullshit that a human partner brings along as baggage.Maybe women will be happy in VR too but its a bigger stretch. Their emotionalsexual needs are not sated in the same way that mens are and when the bulk of men step away and go Nah bitches. its going to shake the female culture to its foundations.Maybe they will get lucky and the AI will be an emotive responsive partner who can give all they want but its going to be rougher than what men need and will come after the male sexual revolution with AI has happened.

5378351,0,t1_cvyxru5,I dont think thats quite true. At least most of the children of school age I have met have had varying degrees of solidarity in terms of where they want to go. I have done  of these types of things in life. A lot of schoolkids are guided by their parents and an astounding amount of Indian kids want to be solicitors. It was like that when I was in school too. What you think an  year old is going to wake up one morning and suddenly know he wants to work in conveyancing just like that? Nope that would be Mummy and Daddy.Despite that a lot of schoolkids do actively get discouraged by their schools and parents. Boys moreover. I remember talking to one boy about session musician work as I did a lot of this in university years. Despite the fact I was meant to be talking about tech to him he was interested in that work and I knew a bit about it. He was eating up every word I said until he eventually said his parents would never let him get that good that any time he would practice his guitar his Dad would get pissed usually on the behest of his Mom that he wasnt doing more schoolwork. I just left it with I used to just practice after school in the school music room... Maybe it planted an idea. Most of the male kids who have seen me at these things are pretty receptive to advice. The ones that are initially shy eventually speak up when they see others doing so. I always try and get things in like you dont have to be a maths genius to make it in IT overall. There are DBAs out there that wouldnt know set theory even if Starbucks decided to put snippets on every cake. Shit my DBA doesnt even know how to do clustering we do it for her.Girls also have a good idea. And it really is not engineering. Ergo why most of the boutique stalls were totally flooded. While it strikes me a lot of the thinner girls made blines for the fashion and arty types. Im not trying to be creepy but these were the girls who you could see will be stunners when theyre .

5379567,0,t3_3olxxg,gt Growing up in an environment where being a black male made people look at me hostile and parents telling me not to act niggerish sagging cussing out adults playing roughfighting I grew up very passive like.

5379735,0,t1_cvz59t8,Alright a couple of things. Pay close attention. What women want doesnt matter. Let me tell you a story I like to tell people. When I got together with my girl I had a lot of things about me that kept her on the fence. Once we stayed together for long enough she told me that those very things are what she started to find attractive in other men she saw on the street. Dont worry about what a woman wants. Worry about what you want and worry about what is effective.Next point Women are not complicated. PreTRP... yeah of course theyre super complicated. You need to lose that belief before you have a lot of success in this arena.  times of out  post TRP I can usually give a reasoning as to why a woman did something. Women ex facto rationalize based on their feelings or emotions and most of them are completely unaware of it there is a video about arguing in the RedPill Nuke post on the top all time posts in this sub. So when you think a girl is complicated when she displays interest but makes it hard for you... or wants to hang out with you and then disses you shit tests its incredible see through. If you stay here long enough and read every story they all pretty much go the exact same way. A rubix cube is also complicated until you learn how to solve it in  seconds and see enough people deal with it that you understand that its not complicated its just not in your scope of understanding.though she genuinely seems like a good girl at heart lt this is both true and not true. Women are naturally Machevellian and solipsistic. If you put your good girl in a place like this she will demonstrate that. Ultimately whats key for you to understand is that an animal is a victim of their desire. If you buy a deadly pet name anything and you feed it and take care of it it can STILL attack you. The its not their fault its in their nature response is a hamster because youre failing to see reality for what it should be.  The same way a vicious dog sometimes has to be put down even though youre sad for it is the same idea with women they are slaves to their machevellian solipsistic ruthless nature. You take pity for them however you treat them as the dangerous animal that they are! Would you keep a dangerous dog thats about to be put down? No. If thats the case then why let a women who you know is a victim of their biology take advantage of you? Go ahead and feel bad for them being created the way they were but ultimately you need to worry about your well being. Thats going to be a hard pill for you to swallow but basically youre letting your softness and love for your girl get in the way of logic. Even if you own a dog... you have to have a strong frame with them and discipline them in order to have the type of well behaved dog that everyone wants.And as far as where I learn this shit from? A lot of different things. Unfortunately I was in a relationship with a unicorn... a woman who was far beyond intellectually and maturity than most the woman who in my eyes is still my sweetheart and still a good girl. She really showed me that AWALT is true. Constant interaction with females in an enviroment that was conducive to it... you get a lot of different reference experience that you start to understand about females... because things happening once or twice are one offs but things happening hundreds of times are not coincidences. Just a lot of experience with women in many different capacities. Finally.... stay here and lurk a bit. Read stores from a lot of different men. Ive been here more than a year... and the central theme of most posts across the board is pretty much the same fucking thing every time whether its in failure or success.Youre no different than any other guy that would come here. Youre too focused internally to see whats really going on. You can achieve success but you have to work hard at it mentally and physically just like I did. Read the sidebar start lifting start talking to a lot of different women and pursue them lurk here more. Itll change your mind. But ultimately just like in that matrix scene you can choose to take the blue pill and fight against it stay with your good girl and hope everything works out. But if current life seems wrong to you if you are truly unhappy at hard then swallow that redpill. I left my sweetheart... I think about her every other day. However as time passes... I realize that I was better than that and its the hardest and best decision that I ever fucking made.,TheRedPill,cvzbl8t,8,t5_2ve1u

5415523,0,t3_3p5z1n,This a very old debate thats been hashed out a long time ago.it goes like this a womens subconscious is whats measuring everything.  It does this based on perception not on objective evidence.  It doesnt wrap a tape measure around your arm and claim ok its X inches so shes attracted instead it weights all available information and grants each guy a value.  That value is then compared how her subconscious perceives herself and if its higher she wants to fuck if its lower then you dont exist.Looks is a huge ass category.  Height is one component as is facial symmetry and musculature.  But dont fall into the trap of thinking BIG MUSCLES YAY! because her subconscious cant tell the difference between a gym bro and someone who does modest exercise and is healthy.  Jacked  Ripped  ect.. is all for impressing other guys or feeding your own self confidence it has very little effect on the female.  Muscles are nice but there is a point you arrive at where the effect just stops that point is usually immediately after the noob gains.The  biggest factor in attraction is status.  Status is absolute king in the mating market everything comes from it.  Physical appearance is just a form of status.  Seduction Game is just bullshiting a females subconscious into perceiving you as higher status then you were otherwise.  Clothing and grooming is just a way to show off status.  How other people talk to you is status if you walk into a room do people notice you?  Do people in your social group defer to you when deciding what to do?  This type of leadership status is really important.  Another source of status is ability.  The ability to do shit.  Being a man of action so to speak where you are capable of getting what you want and she can see it.When we put all this together we can see how womens subconscious will observe how a man is treated how he is spoken to what he does and how he carries himself.  His physique tone of voice and mannerisms will reflect what he thinks of himself.  A womens mind does this interesting thing where she absorbs the judgement of other people and makes it her own.  So if the male thinks highly of himself and projects a confident aura and demeanor then shell judge him to be confident and attractive.So ultimately no LOOKS!!! is not the single most important thing.  Its only one of the easiest to change and creates a snowball effect.  You start lifting getting decent clothing and grooming and you feel more confident.  That self confidence is real and will display itself in how you walk how you talk and how people treat you.  That then snowballs into even more confidence and status suddenly your getting girls left and right.,TheRedPill,cw3w46u,34,t5_2ve1u

This is why this subreddit exists... not to sit here like the mensrights subreddit and get mad at all the constant examples of unequality... but to simply just BE BETTER. There is a saying that goes.... change comes from within. How can we expect things to change if we dont change ourselves first? You know what would make women change irrevocably? If for a couple of generations some of us started working out setting boundaries... then having kids and repeating the process... and then all of a sudden we get to a generation where the men that are valued are those of a RedPill mindset. Its like another poster said before women dont respect a non valuable mans opinion. No one is saying anything about accepting or not accepting behavior evolution has spoken in terms of how women operate. BE BETTER. Women pick the best and we have to BE our best. This is how it works. The best we can do is teach our sons and other men how to be their best. Men are better than women in terms of the value we bring and women born into value get to choose the men fit enough to bear his children.

The blood and sacrifice of their male and female forbears.Damn right. In societies where men do not pander to women women have nothing. Every single scrap of power every single freedom and right ever given to a woman came as a gift from men. They have forgotten that they didnt even have the right to vote in America in the beginning. Our Founding Fathers were some damn smart people and there was a reason they chose not to allow women a say in the government. They knew precisely how it would turn out. Look at the damage that has been done to American society in the brief period since they achieved suffrage. Hell it was women who drove the Temperance Movement and its not really a goddamn coincidence that immediately after they got the right to vote in June  their first official act as a demographic was to establish Prohibition. Note Congress passed Prohibition in January and the states were set to vote against it until a flood of female Temperance voters hit the polls after they were suddenly given suffrage in June. Had the states failed to ratify the th Amendment Prohibition would have been stillborn. and the net result of that was the rise of the Chicago Mob and the Mafia. Great ladies your single most notable accomplishment of the th century is organized crime. Well done and stop fucking voting please. Women put FDR in office and gave him the ability to prolong the Depression and illegally incarcerate millions of Japanese Americans in concentration camps with Executive Order  They put JFK in office and got us embroiled in Vietnam and oh look one of the largest democrat voting blocks to pick both Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama were women.

I would worry more about learning an actual programming language like Python or Ruby.If youre more into data analysis and manipulation Id go with Python. Big Data is going to or is already getting huge. I think there will be lots of money in this field in the near future.If youre into web or app development which is all the craze lately Id go with Javascript amp NodeJS or Ruby amp Rails for web app development or Swift for iOS app development. Rails is the route I went and the job market seems to still be holding strong.However you should note that although the job market is great everyone is trying to be a Junior Developer nowadays. Trying to set yourself apart from everyone else is difficult. Id suggest contributing to open source projects and having your own small projects to show. Basically build up a portfolio of code to show employers that you know what youre doing.And learning programming with no background is quite difficult.. I wouldnt recommend going into it if you know for a fact that youre bad at math theres a strong correlation between competence in mathematics and being a good programmer.

The main problem and one that is unsolvable is that even if you find a legit unicorn you cant be sure that the unicorn will last. In fact female personalities change wildly throughout their adult years. The brain changes in the response to their hormones.

Of course by this time the cultures were so far removed from the Roman Empire as we thnk of it that it was nonexistent.Western culture seems hellbent on its own selfdestruction.  Eventually this weak culture will be overtaken by a stronger one but it will be over an extended period of time and will come about through a combination of things such as low fertility cultural shift and possibly wars or the negative effects of losing proxy wars.

They will just create nothing out of thin air and just make drama for no reason because they want those feelz attention or potential validation they will receive even if theyre ones starting shit. Sometimes women are so use to doing that shit with guys and nothing bad happening to them they just do it with anyone because theyre always thinking Well wtf are you gonna do?! The other  guys Ive done this shit too havent done shit and your less of a man than majority of them so WTF YOU GONNA DO?!!!Thats why you see so many comedians like Kevin Hart talk about that or you see videos on the internet with that exact thing happening because often times when a girl does that to the wrong guy or pushes him far enough and gets hit or dropped...then the hysteria and water works coming pouring down with the quickness as they go into victimgirl mode because they honestly thought that no guy would hit them and couldnt possibly fathom how it could happen to them.Women are also quick to do some bullshit to a guy who has done time or has a record because they know that if a convict does something back to them theyre automatically going to jail so they use that against guys like you and that dude she was bitching at. My brother has a record and lives with a chick who knows about it and often times will egg him on to hit her or do something to cause  she knows that he wont do it because he doesnt want the cops to get involved because of the possibility of going jail no questions asked and getting charged. There has been times when he has snatched the bitch by her collar and got physical enough with her to the point where she snapped back to reality and scaled down her hysteria extremely quick because she realize she was about to get fucked up. Most girls dont think that far ahead until they get fucked up or the situation hits the climax.Fat girl felt comfy enough to do this crazy shit because she was on a mission in wanting to fuck up everyones evening cock blocking to the extreme challenging you on some shit because you wouldnt back down and knowing that she had white knight or someone to protect her in case if shit got real.

If you were out here in the trenches more you would see what I mean. Ive just turned  and in my admittedly limited experience of all the women Ive been with in any romanticsexual manner I would say  in  are dateable. And every single one of those had cheated on a previous boyfriend. Of course that might be as much a statement of the betatude of the average male as much as a critique of these women.Of those  that are marriage material? Sounds like unicorn hunting to me.

I dont want kids never have never will and Im mid s... fuck those little balls of life sucking money draining fun destroying parasites.  All my friends have kids and none of them have done jack shit with their lives other then that.  Ive travelled with my wife and weve done and seen amazing things becauses we can afford to no kids and because we are not tied down to other schedules school day care etc.As a man you do not need to be held hostage to her biological imperative any more then you need to be held hostage to he pussy.  Find a woman that is not interested in kids and wants to have a career and you can skip most of the worries about being divorce raped.  And if you do split there is a good chance that you wont be paying her much for alimony if anything.. and forget child support.  ,TheRedPill,cwpfgnd,8,t5_2ve1u
5585594,0,t3_3rl47b,Your post is self indulgent denial. In the modern world families and kids belong to WOMEN. Do you know where you rank insofar as society is concerned? Youre the Third Officer. The leader of the household is women following that her friends and female relatives THEN the males. You have no command authority over your family at all in the modern schema and every female alive under the age of  knows this well.  The reason modern women mock displays of masculinity is because those macho expressions arent backed up by authority. Go ahead and commit to a modern woman. One day shell put you to the test and when you call her bluff as a proper man should be she will drop the hammer on you via a literal Legion of bluepill enablers in modern government. Modern cops and government functionaries absolutely LOVE teaching a delusional man such as yourself who really runs the family household. Argue so much as one time with a female and you can end up in front of a judge on DV charges .Go ahead and attend a local circuit court session if you think Im full of it.  Passing on your genetic legacy is only ensured by spinning plates perpetually. This aint  bud. Commitment to a woman nowadays means Awesome. I have his money and his house in my pocket.  Im gonna go fuck my friends hunky drug dealer  because now I have a nest for my brood. Your counter is  of course that you have some secret crystal ball process which vets unicorns so well this will never happen to you. Besides  the studies state it only happens to  in ten guys anyways and youre way too cool to get cuckd.Lets roll with that. What the studies to date dont control for are multiple kids.In America if  of families are genetically cucked that translates to millions of people who are raising someone elses kids and many of them are likely mixed families where out of three kids only one genetically belongs to the nominal fatherthats YOU OP. Which means youll be toiling two score and change raising your weed dealers genetic legacy not yours. Even if half your kids belong to you thats still a very shitty proposition considering some Alpha is balls deep in a hotter piece of tail then your unicorn.His legacy is secure. Yours is limited.Another distressing point for the Unicorn Hunters the more unstable the Alpha the less likely the woman will pursue him for money. Girls know the devil may care ex con with a drug habit and felony record aint father material. Wont stop her from fucking him or wanting to have his kid. Ive seen too many harrowing cases of proper society women truly scraping the pond scum of Society for a side fuck. Oh look  your unicorn fell pregnant. But why is this kid of yours so impulsive and violent when the first one wasnt? Hope you like paying for rehab trips and lawyers bud.Women  BTWhave no moral qualms lying to their entire male family members for DECADES about cucolding.I wish you luck accomplishing a way to find The Honest Woman  a task men have tried and failed to do since the fucking Old Testament was in first edition published scroll.

Odds are shell back away from filing charges once her emotions cool down and her logical side informs her that the video is going to show enthusiastic consent. Though if the sex was rough she may think that she could make the accusation stick. It just haaaaaapend! She knows shes caught deadtorights. She falls on her sword with apologies and promises that itll never happen again but will never ever admit that her misdeed was a conscious decision on her part.Those two are possible responses but I think the probable response is thisShe breaks up with you and immediately begins socializing to her network that throughout the relationship youve been an abusive asshole. Weeks ago she found that you had placed CCTV cameras in the house. Shed tried to be understanding but when she found the cameras she knew that that was the final straw.She was scared to leave you but once you went on vacation she knew she had her chance to finally get out without you murdering her.

Its good at the beginning but its best to hit some harder shit once the OTC stuff loses its effectiveness. I like sandman and stardusk videos on youtube. I believe their pill is harder and more effective in knocking you out of the nonesense that is modern women and courting. You are not the problem in the general sense. Society is and all the forces acting on you. But its only you that can turn it all off and truly be free. After absorbing some of the MGTOW videos my TRP game is much better. When I say I dont really give a fuck about what some plate is doing its closer to the truth than Ive ever been. A sociopathic disconnection to their manipulation is truly what you need to be happy imo. Im not about to give up women like some of the hardcore MGTOW but the truth for me is somewhere between trp and mgtow.

If a man came into your life buddy up with you to start a corp then jumps ship to a fortune  company taking the whole company secret with him. Would you make up with him and start another company together  years down the road? It does not make sense when the gender is your own and that is how you should treat woman. Ask yourself what would you do if its a man and all things in your relationship can be equated to similar relationship as a business cofounder.You either use her as a fuck toy or you get amusement out of destroying her life.

It is a very directly biblicalbased denomination so the minister doesnt really muddy the waters by spinning yarn we just go straight to the holy book for our lessons.Not to pick on Catholics but in some congregations I have been to the Bible is not read in the service. You just sit there and listen to the priest and assume hes telling the truth and then do a bunch of weird stuff like pray to the Virgin Mary which the Bible never says to do.There are Christian priests that still propagate an atmosphere of mystery and secrets around the religion and there are others that are the complete opposite.

Its religious leaders forcing their own myopic belief onto others that has been the reason for retardation of knowledge and discovery. Interesting thing. Muslims are arguably the most populous religion on the planet yet only two Nobel prizes in a century. Jews make up a tiny fraction of the world population yet they have won the lions share of Nobel prizes for science and technology. Its cant possibly be that such a wide range of races are all less intelligent than Jews but it is very possible that the religion they follow which is based on ignorance fear and keeps them from achieving the greatness of their intellect. I grew up Lutheran being forced to attend parochial school reading the bible in class rather than learning something useful. Then at  I met an Arab girl from Dubai and to marry her I needed to learn the religion. I did spent months living in a mosque in Dubai learning from the men there. Ended up we didnt get married long story but neither her fault nor mine but I now know two religions quite well. By comparing the two and then each to science which I was forced to be ignorant of in church school I came to realize both are celebrating ignorance hatred and are divisive while offering little in the way of self advancement. This is the nutshell version of why Im not only atheistic but anti theism as well.

5791640,0,t1_cxf013s,I know. Agree . Hence I call him not a total beta. Hes somewhere in between his transformation from blue to red now. If he was red he wouldnt have gotten married in the first place second he wouldnt commit third he wouldnt waste his energy on a revenge dump video wouldnt bother making her feel guilty about her behaviour etc.Edit Oh wait a comment on the main thread says the same thing just slightly better.gtI think the only negative I can see in this approach is the assumption that she cares. Like....at all. In my experience someone that cheats in the way she cheats doesnt give a shit about the other person at this point. This is the type of person who has a boo a secret man AND bangs rando guys at the barclub. Will she be embarrassed that her face and the video are pasted all over the internet? Sure. Are there going to be inconveniences as a result of the break? Maybe. Will she be ashamed? Fuck no. And in the end shell be sucking this other dudes dick by pm tonight without a care in the world.gtStill  Its entertaining.gtI was dating a girl for about six months who cheated on me. I found out and wasnt profoundly affected until I confronted her and she denied it for six hours. For six hours she lied to my face and at the end of those six hours I had devised a plan. I spent the next six months romancing her like nobody has ever been romanced. She was head over heels in love with me. And in those six months I plowed about six other women. Then one night I told her and watched her crumble. That was ten years ago. She still calls and texts me randomly. Cunt fucked with the wrong sociopath.,TheRedPill,cxf0ad0,107,t5_2ve1u

5795348,0,t1_cxf84mh,This is going to be a short response.Its not him being nonstoic its everything about him as a whole. The same way girls can scream red flags for me he screams a guy that will get cheated on. Ive been on his side before and now Im on the other side. Theres no doubt in my mind that theres a pattern in the type of men women cheat on. The women really dont give a shit. They laugh about their guy they know they are using the guy I laugh with them. doctorlw had some points but I see it differently. The short version of what I see is that shes already given up with him you can see how she carries herself around him. Obviously hes not trying to game her but he has  charm. Girls tear up all the time she forgets about chad while reading the letter is touched by it tears up no one mentions the next step which is she can fuck chad the same day Im not kidding try it yourself. So what if she teared up. I look at how both of them are and I cant remember the last time my interaction with a woman felt like that. When I look at him I see what women are trying to run away from while still extracting what value they can get. This is why they cheat and dont give a shit. Because they lost nothing of value.Personally I recommend going out there and trying it. Fuck a girl who has a bf or fiance. ,TheRedPill,cxfgui3,5,t5_2ve1u

Meaning that the equality of sexes means women losing out when they refuse to participate and suffer like equals. Women who are willing to love men in the same station and situation as them will win and women who cant will simply lose.That is something that most women find disagreeable as they want more and more value heaped on their quickly decreasing value to men. If women were to go on strike today most men wouldnt even notice unlike fifty years ago when most men would be thrown for a complete loop with no one caring for their kids no one teaching in the schools no one making dinner and no one grocery shopping.

Not sex just pure romance. There was the question written in rose petals. There was more but that would be too much detail.She comes out and at first her face was filled with joy and it Sours to disappointment. It was so cliche I said to her you dont like it do you.No ... I.. I do. Its just...No you dont... And I walk away a little and we talk about it. Exactly what is said above.It was just not what I expected.When you fucking love someone you shouldnt expect anything more than their fucking love. Love is not some game where we play to win.

Every time he got knocked on his ass he got up and went after the guy and ended up connecting with a few good punches. After the fight the two of them had a mutual respect simply because neither pussied out. Something Ive learned is that it doesnt matter if you get your ass kicked in a fight.

Keyword here is HAPPY.Now that youve discovered true female nature theres no going back. Deal with it. It is what it is. I know it seems like we have to play the game but remember the guys who dont play any games go for what they want without hesitation and WOMEN CHASE HIM. There are natural alphas who havent heard of game and quite frankly cant be bothered to give a shit about it either.Again like rollo tomassi says To BE a man IS to perform. Dont look at it like its something you have to do to get girls. Your natural state SHOULD be that of performing not so you can impress women but you do it because you are a Man who is becoming the kind of guy who likes what he sees. If you dont youll come across as a fantastic beta bucks since you werent doing it for you anyways. Women do have something called intuition. The man who is concerned with himself is the man women wanna be around. They are masters in figuring this stuff out. Like patrice oneal says They dont wanna win they want a winnerWhen i look in the mirror i wanted a women by my side.

The people who think hes great are wrong. Im sure hes a nice person but he did it wrong and he paid the price. Its only through good luck and a lot of work and the mothers unabashed viciousness that hes in such a good position at this point. I still think he could have gotten here earlier with less effort and risk.

I feel that its best to confide in someone you truly trust someone who wont judge you mostly family even friends will judge you if you show too much emotion imo. Be true to yourself. Lie to everyone else. I believe that he who can control his emotions is a strong person.

The ones who were a bit too arrogant and burned too many bridges while they were on top will also be abandoned.I read a story once about a guy who lost his job and became homeless.  Pretty much everyone abandoned him even his friends and family.  His church a very prominent one I think Ronald Reagan used to attend said that he didnt pay his membership dues so they couldnt help him out.  He survived and eventually crawled back out of homelessness but he learned a hard lesson about being alone in the world.Edit found the story  gtI was not and am not now a drug addict or an alcoholic. The fact is workingsober people can become homeless too. Indiana Congresswoman Julia Carson knows this to be true. A member of her staff found my web site and wrote me an email informing me that  of the homeless in America are employed.gtIll be honest before I became homeless I knew very little about homeless people. While I gave them money occasionally I was really ignorant about their situation. Why were they homeless? Didnt they have any friends or family to help them? Well I had friends and I was homeless.gtThe worst part about being homeless wasnt living on the streets or being hungry it was having my friends or the people I thought were my friends turn their backs on me.gtWhen I called these people they treated my situation with absolutely no urgency.

However this is probably just more bad habits and fear mentality where I assume that my behavior will be perceiveda as having the worse possible intentions.  When I was dancing earlier at the end of the dance plenty of dudes would come up and try to get the next dance probably because they figured that if they didnt some other guy would.All of these rules are just trying to bring order to chaos.  In my mind I was taking a reasonable approach but I may have just across as cowardly and therefore low value.In the social dance world there are all these rules of etiquette but they are mostly directed at the men.  Anyone interested in how women keep lower value men at a distance should study social dance rules and see how they all are designed to keep the creeps from making unwanted advances.

6032168,0,t1_cy9y74d,I agree mostly.Theres a distinction. Men are logical based on an attempted objective  view of reality and their place in it. This leads men to philosophize about their own principals and how they believe the world should work. Men are idealistic. They will do things based on trying to prove validate or ascertain some greater truth that is bigger than them. This is how men are corrupted and manipulated. They are deluded into believing that whatever actions they take are serving some greater truth. This is the danger in men they are led astray not by emotions but by idealism that causes them to commit atrocities for a greater purpose. Apart from the twisted sadistic fucks in the deepest reaches of most men who are corrupted lies a sense of justice or wish for goodness that has become warped gradually. That is my belief.Women are highly logical in the absolute most solipsistic manner possible. They are highly logical in that actions are prioritized based on how they serve the self. It is the complete opposite of men. You are correct in saying that they are completely mercenary. I believe the distinction I referred to is how we view the basis of logic our fundamental world view.Men observe they are a piece in the world and they want to explore it and manipulate it. They manipulate the external in most cases. That is why we prize information and objectivity about externalities. We want to know how we stand in relation to things outside of us. Our place.Women ARE the world to themselves everything happens TO them. Things interact with them they dont interact with things. They are the greater not the lesserin their minds anyways. This is why they are much more skilled than men in manipulating the internal they are completely at home with living in a fluctuating chaotic internal environment or should I say fluidly changing? Chaos has a negative connotation to me in this regard so there is my male bias. For a man a womans internal state is chaotic and bad but for women it is natural. Thats why hamstering is so damn easy for them whereas a guy would feel ill at ease just rearranging the facts like that it gives me a headache just thinking about it.Because of this emotional and solipsistic fluidity women are totally shit at jobs that require them to think for a greater entity like leadership roles. They can maintain a rational and logical state only as long as emotions dont run high. When they do they lose all objectivity and are as RedSinecure stated easily emotionally manipulated and lead astray.,TheRedPill,cyac1f2,5,t5_2ve1u

Theyre angry at women theyre angry at themselves theyre angry that nature made women into lying cheating sluts and that society doesnt accept men to be masculine or for men to be able to be victims or whatever...Eventually all that general anger needs to be shed. When you have anger directed at specific injustices THAT is when anger becomes most useful to men and drives them in the right direction for fixing their lives.Being pissed off at the world does jack shit for fixing your own life or the world as a whole. Do I get angry? Sure. I get angry every time I hear about some dude getting divorce raped. Even blue pill beta dudes really dont deserve the amount of fucking over they get in divorcefamily court.

If you dont then youre ignoring her and thus not committed to the relationship and its obvious that shes the only one who cares.And I have the perfect example from last night .So the wife is out babysitting for some close friends of hers and I have the house to myself. Ive already put in a  hour day since she wont get a real job so Im happy to have the time alone. I do a few things around the house then fire up some fallout and relax for a bit. Id rather be out in the garage woodworking but it is near freezing in there so fallout it is.Later on she calls five times on the  minute ride home and I dont see the phone go off. She gets home so I save and exit the game to go hang out with her. Shes obviously pissed because I dont care about her and blah blah. Im being selfish and how are we going to have kids if I get so wrapped up in my game that I miss her calls. So its obvious Im not putting in any effort and I dont care about her otherwise Id be waiting with baited breath for her to call and never miss one either. This despite the fact that I called her on the way home for a nice little chat and then I cleaned up the house some before starting my game. All that is meaningless though because right now she feels like I dont care and thus everything that happened before is meaningless.

As long as you feel that anger it means you still havent changed.To be angry at unfairness inequality machiavelianism hypocrisy or uneven power structures simply shows that part of you still wants to believe in a fantasy world where fairness equality morality and truth are values that are rewarded.They arent now they werent in the past and they wont be in the future.Once you realize that  to  of men are simply useful animals  beasts of burden like horses or mules  then watching women ride the little beta animals is simply watching nature in action.Lions eat gazelles. Wolves eat sheep. Women eat betas alive.Once you swallow that pill all sorts of shit finally comes into focus.For example there was a very powerful U.S. Secrerary of State named Henry Kissinger.

Soldiers are big dumb animals that are trained to do what theyre told... and so are  of people in the world.Men are the big dumb animals who lift heavy shit and do difficult things like engineering and women are the small dumbbutcunning animals who pump out babies and trick the big animals into providing for them and Chads kids.Thats not a bug or a mistake.

They may even find that women will say things like  I enjoy talking to you.   This is a comfort first approach that kills sexual attraction.

Thats the difference between someone driven by ideology and someone driven by reason. People wonder why leftists are so often atheists  its because their ideology is itself a religious force there is no room for any other note I am an atheist myself. They start with an ideology  that all people are born completely equal all races and both genders. Of course when you start with such a flawed assumption and project it to the real world where people are completely different a factor must be invented to explain this. That factor is always an illusory oppression whether its Hitlers Jews the marxists capitalists or the feminists patriarchy. Since collectivists always view people as part of a collective rather than as individuals the individual must be punished for the amount of privlege their collective enjoys or benefit from the supposed oppression of their collective.

If you want to further sour you idea of women and rip the forcefully down of the pedestal read some rock star biographies. They always eventually get bored of regular sex and start doing the me debasing shit imaginable to these women and the women are not only okay with it but eat it up. I recommend The Dirt. By The Motley Crew. Hilarious.As for the three situations I can explain Beta males or dirt balls. These guys cant get a certain level of hot woman even lets say an  or even a . Now here comes this disgusting skank that may very well be an . Now she wants to get used like a filthy whore but she cant find two alphas to do it because alphas dont share pussy. Now this chick wants it so bad she finally gives up and settles for two dirt ballsbetas so she can fulfill her fantasy. The guys go for it because they know this is pretty much the only chance they will ever get to fuck a girl this hot. This is disgusting period.  The typical beta bucks and bulls. This is your usual cucking and the normal setup that TRP talks about all the time. A beta due to his bucks manages to get into an LTR or even marriage with a hottie. However he knows he is not blowing her mind in the sack like Chad used to. Now the girl can either divorce rape him and go fuck Chad or just leave him and go fuck Chad. Now he certainly doesnt want to get divorce raped and he may think correctly no doubt that this is the best he is ever going to do. So he agrees to let her fuck Chad on the side so she is satisfied but at least he still gets to fuck her and keep his money. Like I said a total cuck and again fucking disgusting. The guy is secretly gay or bisexual and basically wants a dick in his ass or mouth and is just hoping that just like in the porn he watches the wife is going to force him to blow or get fucked by the other guy.. Now I dont really care about this last one if youre gay or bi all the more power to you. I dont give a shit. However unlike women very very few men are true bisexuals. So the probability of finding two bisexual men that want to fuck each other AND share a woman at the same time AND have the woman be down with that most women find male on male sex pretty off putting is fucking astronomical. It has to be like  million to one at a minimum. This is is stark contrast to a threesome with two women and a man because the majority of women are a least a little bit gay so when you share a woman with your LTR or plate or whatever both parties are getting something out of it. This is why this is the far more common type of the threesomes. ,TheRedPill,cz0re8b,1,t5_2ve1u

6281640,0,t3_41hpzw,Procedure cost me  due to my insurance coverage. I got the snip and not the laser. It didnt really feel like it set me free. I already have children. I still have protected sex because of STDs. I did it because my ex kept forgetting to take her BC. She left me before my I was completely healed. I dont tell any of the women I sleep with that Ive had it done. Ive heard many guys having the procedure done and back to work like nothing happened in three days. That was not my case.The nurse checked my vitals and had me sign some papers. She verified I had compression shorts and told me to remove my pants and underwear and lay on the table after she leaves. I recommend wearing basketball shorts or track pants and a t shirt. I lay on the table and the doctor told me this wouldnt hurt at all he does about  a year while he gently shaves my balls. Id only feel a little pin prick and some tugging and hed be done. That was complete bullshit. I was awake for the procedure sweating bullets and staring at the ceiling trying not to puke or flinch. I did feel a pin prick and then a burning sensation in my right testicle. Some tugging as he cut open my sack and pulled out vas deferens through the hole. I then felt something like a mule kick in my stomach on the right side of my belly button and a white light enter my vision. This was the doctor clipping the vas deferens. Some more tugging as he clipped the cut ends of my vas deferens. This is where I tried not to vomit and sweat was rolling out of my forehead. I then watched his hand go up in the air with some string coming from the bottom of his fist. This was the doctor sewing up my sack.The whole procedure that happened on my right was mirrored on my left  mule kicks and all. The doctor used some glue then some gauze and said he was done. After the procedure I very carefully put on the compression shorts. Then the rest of my clothes and hobbled out to the lobby to sign more papers. It was embarrassing to walkhobble from the office to my car but at this point I didnt care I just wanted to get home.I get in the car and place a bag of frozen peas on my crotch. Get home and stay on the couch for the day swapping bags of frozen peas. I stayed that way for the weekend and fended for myself as my loving wife who was also a nurse berated me for asking her to make me some food while I was resting on the couch.The moving around was how I ended up pulling apart a suture and getting it infected. It hurt for weeks and I had to take some antibiotics for a week and for the infection to clear. My sack never really did swell up to an unmanageable size but I swapped compression shorts for  days straight. I still feel shocks of pain if I sit just right and can feel about an inch gap between the vas deferens ends inside each testicle. Id do it again but would do laser. I cant really tell the difference and I rarely feel any pain. There are some real horror stories out there but luckily my story was tame compared to others. If you get it done try to go for a Friday and take the Monday off. Get someone to take care of you or get a small refrigerator near your couchbed and fill it with food. Dont lift weights run or ride a bike for a couple weeks just to be safe. If you think you may want children in the future then freeze your sperm for future use. ,TheRedPill,cz3nhk0,1,t5_2ve1u

6327508,0,t3_429un6,Weve all been through worse brother. This is as good of a starting point as any. I just have a few notes that should help you in the future. That you think youre smarter than me test is tricky because it SEEMS like a shit test but its more likely a comfort test. The whole issue probably cuts really deep to the HB  Blonde with a Masters Degree probably gets disrespected intellectually an awful lot and she was hoping youd be different the goal of any test. Next time it comes up and it will  a lot of smart women feel disrespected intellectually your response should be to agree and amplify I also think Im prettier than you but you dont seem as mad about that. That will clue her in that youre fucking with her because clearly shes prettier than you. Shell be smart enough to put two and two together. I think missing this one is where your night derailed.. However you still PROBABLY pull her if you offer YOUR place instead of hers during the buy her a drink situation. The feminist line was pretty funny but if they insist on breaking your balls about it that means theyre not buying it. My read on the situation here is that the couple is TRYING to get you laid albeit with conventional tactics like drinkbuying. Id have probably called them out as a clever way to escalate at the same time Alright since your new best friends are clearly intent on breaking my balls about buying you a drink Ill make you a deal If we get to the end of the evening and I still think youre cool Ill buy you and hb friend a drink back at my place. Its ok to recognize social queues  dont make the mistake that most guys make and think of this as breaking frame. Youre allowed to be observant! You can also agree and amplify if you get stumped here See? This is how it happens. First they want you to buy them a drink and before you know it they want a house.. Next time take it slow on the drinks. A Masters Degree holder might not let a dude whos been pounding brewskis all night drive her home if it seems like hes not handling his liquor well. Some advice from a bar veteran start with one hard drink and switch to water. Lower calories and youre still sober enough to drive and game perfectly.,TheRedPill,cz8v9z6,13,t5_2ve1u

6337697,0,t3_42eri3,gtBut as I discussed earlier when people are asked what sex is for they dont say anything about it being a test of adequacy or a performance. They say that sex is for procreation release or the expression of love and closeness. Yet these are the same people who when they are not being asked what sex is for will unapologetically speak of sexual prowessThis to me is a crucial passage but the author is missing something.  of course SexAsTest is still about procreation.   Whether you reproduce or not and whether your offspring reproduce or not etc.  How prolific each generation is and how capable they are in their lifetimes of guarding that is a test.Reproductive success or failure is the test of any species.  The difference is that the Sexual Revolution and the pill and open hypergamy mark the near total splitting of sex as procreation from sex as bonding and sex as test and sex as possession.  No more is it so that young men must prove their virility young women prove their warmth young men win sex young women win commitment young men own a particular woman by taking her virginity young women harness the man by having his young etc.  All the civilization built rituals  no matter how much they deviate from this ever anticipated a broadly distributed near perfectly operating and female controlled chemical break of the reproductive act and the bonding act and the sexualtest act.  No Muria sex hut style culture anticipated the childs play of sexual exploration to last from the  and  year olds so given to it.....into a persons s much less childless persons who are unmarried and produce no wealth beyond that for themselves!  No Abrahamic culture so keen on the carnal knowledge could fathom a world where sex wasnt the marriage itself.  For them premarital sex was as an impossibility as premeal eating any food you ate was the meal with significant penalty in attempting to eat elsewhere or eat anothers food or leave a meal half eaten etc. But yet the pill much more perfect than anything which came before enabled the societal break That of completely unrestrained female sexuality  which still doesnt accomplish the objectives of female sexuality  but which still constrains male sexuality trapped in the physical ritual or else trapped in the social constructs around it Hypergamy is inbuilt into women because sex is bonding procreation and test.  But it isnt supposed to be unchecked or mismatched to male sexual drive.  That to me is crucial   and why I support any kind of male birth control and tell men never to marry not succumb to oneitis to never provide commitment to sluts but enjoy many of them to jealously guard their wealth from the State etc. Until the male sexuality is just as unbound from sex as bonding Sex as test and sex as procreation as it has come unbound for women the mismatch will only destroy civilization.Otherwise the SMV is one of totally different currencies and a garbage exchange rate.  ,TheRedPill,cza0xxr,10,t5_2ve1u

NaziRussia was Socialist USSR in  and Germany was terrified of them.  The Germans were actually being ruled by a Conservative Traditional government with a president named HindenburgObjectively his leadership is the closest thing to truth they had and would be the right relative to the other two options which were  Communists  National Socialists...but thats not how it was portrayed.Rather than one to the right and two to the left instead the Nazi party claimed to be more right than the right.Which was absurd...  a sort of cosmic joke.So the practical genius of seeing history based in core truths is that you can base your evaluation on whether there is significant mythology or not.Communism and National Socialism are mythological ideologies.Hopefully you understand now.ampnbsp,TheRedPill,czfnyy5,1,t5_2ve1u

6411112,0,t3_43ashk,What I have learned in political discussion is to let people hang themselves with the rope they provide. Start off by asking questions and innocuous statements and sooner or later you will come around full circle to make their argument look foolish. I did this the other day with a guy that said that people think Trump would launch nukes if he becomes President. I questioned him on his reasoning behind it and then with his own answers nullified his statement. He got very pissed but its the best way to handle it because they basically fucked themselves with it and are either forced to admit they are wrong or break frame.

6496601,0,t3_4467cn,gtMany here participate on a subreddit dedicated to the supposed rational debate of these very accusations. purplepilldebate To argue it misses the point entirely.Allow me to shed light on why a red piller would choose to visit that sub despite knowing PPD is designed to perpetuate the arguments without ever coming to any objectively mutually beneficial resolutions.In a word its practice. There is no better way to test your own knowledge of TRP than to experience all the little tricks and tactics the trolls will use in an attempt to shame you into submission. In my mind if you have not been banned from PPD yet it probably wouldnt hurt to read up on the basics again. Its one thing to debate in good faith there but if youre sufficiently red pilled when making your own submissions the trolls and mods will shit bricks stifling your messages with completely bogus accusations to justify deleting your threads while threatening to ban you if you challenge the status quo again. It doesnt take long for a red piller who stays on point to get banned is what Im saying and I know I dont really care if I ever get the chance to post there again. Fun as it was while it lasted I couldnt have asked for a better send off. Getting banned from that sub is like graduating from a college that specializes in teaching you how to effectively call people on their bullshit. The real world benefits were more than worth the effort for me.Despite how ignorant and hateful almost everyone is against you there so many things can be taken away from the experience. One of the most interesting aspects of arguing with these people is that once you have seen and heard all of their arguments predicting them and responding by trumping an SJWs talking points with logic is where the real challenge begins. The thing is SJWs do not respond to logic head on. They simply do not acknowledge logic and rationality that comes from you. The last thing an SJW wants to do is validate any aspect of what you have to say not because youre wrong but because the SJWs true goal is to invalidate you. Once it really hits you just how rigged the debates are against red pillers you start to see how all the dots connect together. They attempt to rile you up get you emotional with their smug bullshit and shaming tactics. Thats because they want to escalate the argument with you. They want you to lose your cool so they have an easier time quoting you out of context on other subreddits forming brigades and then coordinating tactical vote manipulations while continuing to project their bullshit onto you even through PMs until you finally snap. A red piller isnt going to snap of course. A red piller is for the most part completely unphased if not thoroughly amused by these hypocritical cowards. A red piller sees the tactics being employed and learns how the SJWs operate what SJWs believe and what SJWs actually believe. A red piller processes this information on a person by person basis then uses that knowledge to cuntsmash the whole sub. The point isnt to win the arguments. The point is to get good at owning the SJWs and their disingenuous backhanded accusations so that you can focus on learning how SJWs will respond once they have been checkmated. They dont engage your logic in good faith what they look for is anything they can grab hold of to shift the focus on anything they can plausibly get away with shaming you over so that you must stay firmly on the defensive. They know either way they have you where they want you if they convince you its necessary to justify your existence. Youll either get worn down while they continue further derailing the topic or youll get frustrated and theyll use that anger to perpetuate the notion that you are the troll and a bad person for agreeing with anything on TRP. It will click with you sooner or later that this is whats really happening and thats why its fun to rock the whole sub once you get it. TRP could easily dominate PPD with just a handful of dedicated red pillers who refuse to deviate from whatever the topic at hand is. Naturally such an effective lot of red pillers would vanish from the sub without a trace. A well documented record of such an effort would make for interesting study material on TRP I would imagine.This lesson alone was but one valuable insight I took away from PPD that benefited me in the real world. Im very good at picking up on liars and calling them on it in person now. A lot of strategies blue pillers use to attack TRP dont mean shit in the real world where I can debunk and suss out the true intent behind the deceitful language a curious number of people use to influence the reactions they want right there on the spot. ,TheRedPill,czraor3,1,t5_2ve1u

6503220,0,t1_czrzbgr,GENDER  shaming is identified with of homosexuality.Some boys get the message that it is not acceptable for them to be male or that they are very bad at being male. This can come from a mother communicating to her son in blatant or subtle ways that she wishes he were a girl that she sees him as a girl or that she doesnt want him to be or act like a boy. It can develop when sisters or other girls tease or humiliate him for acting like a boy. Boys in this situation may try to please those around them by abandoning their maleness. This message can also come from boys or men ridiculing or insulting his male traits such as his body voice mannerisms or lack of athleticism. This may cause the boy to resent fear or avoid other males.MODERN LEFT breeds HOMOSEXUALS.And most significantly gender shame can come from a boys harsh judgments about his own male attributes particularly related to his body and athleticism.

While it might save a guy from a rape type felony charge it still could result in a voyeurism type charge.  The severity would depend on the state and even the local DAprosecutor.  Some would feel the guy had enough dealing with the false rape accusation and give a pass on the lesser charge.  Others might offer a slap on the wrist.  While the criminal stuff might pan out you could still be sued civilly though one would be wise to counter sue over the false rape allegation.

So I couldnt understand when she would be confused as to if she finds me attractive anymore or not and then when she ultimately broke up with me. Its cause I was too nice. I was a beta bitch. The first night I met her I banged her out in the back of my car.  months in I couldnt even bang her after a  date night. But I still am thankful for that relationship. Because it taught me so much and brought me here. And she was deeply honest for a girl so I was able to learn exactly about the female mindset after it was all said and done. She would share her feelings with me and tell me all the shit that she was feeling and now I can look back on it and see why she was confused or why she wanted drama or why she couldnt figure out why she would go through periods where she questioned my attractiveness to her. I still remember months in when we were barely having sex...she was getting on my nerves and wanted to leave some place in public. So I turned her around and said Shut the fuck up. We are staying. Later that night she told me she had never been so turned on with me before than when I told her to shut the fuck up.

It also shows that beta behavior is more than just a reproductive strategy it is a biological imperative to favor women and protect the species.,TheRedPill,czzuhwr,27,t5_2ve1u
6579701,0,t1_czzupcl,Your bodys hormone levels are constantly in flux. The hormones you should be paying attention to and educating yourself on are dopamine estrogen testosterone and cortisol. Dopamine releases make you feel good cocaine releases dopamine inhibits reuptake causing levels to rise thanks uflatturbo cortisol is released when youre stressed testosterone is released when youre lifting and during sex. However our body is constantly balancing testosterone and estrogen. If your testosterone shoots up your estrogen follows soon after. Basically bad things happen when cortisol and estrogen levels shoot up and generally testosterone and dopamine releases are good even desired.Imbalanced hormonal levels make you do crazy shit. Women experience imbalanced hormonal levels ALL the fucking time whereas men can keep their hormones in check most of the time if they take care of their bodies. This is why men can be more logical more stoic etc than women. Like a lot of physical activities jacking off sex causes a temporary hormonal imbalance. I like to call it going on tilt. Go on tilt regularly and well then you start acting like a womanbeta. Nothing wrong with it once in a while especially when you get distracted by your drive easily and you need to focus on something like studying or work. But its a situational thing a tool.

Theyll dox you and your family for targeted harassment in real life send letters to your employers and school and plaster your name on television and online articles before your trial has been concluded. They will milk it for all its worth squeezing every last drop of victimhood validation they can. Any other SJW listening doesnt care if the claim is true only that it smears the reputation of the enemy framed by the narrative.I would know Ive been falsely accussed of abuse by an sjw in my family someone who I rarely interacted with unless absolutely necessary. After making several power moves to smear my social standing for no reason whatsoever she started telling my coworkers I was regularly abusive then came running back  mins later trying to reconcile. I ignored her  showed no emotion never explained myself to anyone. She was so pissed I didnt give her validation she kept looking back at me to see my reaction.  Apparently I hurt her feelz and this was a justified response. Fuck her. Thank goodness no one took it seriously. I no longer live with her.Recently a blue piller ThalestoAristotle falsely accused me of sending them death threats on the blue pill sub. When people started inquiring them on the subject they took the lie full force I told him to present archived image evidence of this claim and none was presented. The response was a downvote brigade on much of my post history insults and circle jerking. None of them cared if it was false only that my image was smeared. Google and Redirecting Search ResultsWhat they are doing is literally the first step to reeducation camps. Google has long been compromised. They are one of the top biggest data collectors in the entire world. Of course they sold out to the government especially in Germany along with other media outlets relating to antiimmigration opinions. Google has huge market share in the search engine race along with a monopoly on several other technologies and they seek to take advantage of that to shape the narrative for Big Daddy Government. Vote with your money. Choose a different search engine. I use DuckDuckgo.com much prettier collects less data but requires you to turn off the safe search if you delete your cookies.

I also caution you to watch the heavy weight.  I have a high ape index very long arms and in my s I kept going heavier and heavier.  In the end I cooked my shoulders.  You only get one set of joints and heavy weights do take a toll on them.  The good news is you dont need to go super heavy to look good.  As others have mentioned here  diet.  You can have a Porsche but its not going anywhere without good fuel.  Ive lost count on how many guys Id see in the gym working out day after day and not gain a ounce of muscle.  You do hit your genetic limit but at the beginning its almost always diet keeping you back.  Its really amazing how little work you need to put in to look better than  of the dudes out there.  Again Im  and granted my genetics for this stuff is probably better than most guys but I only work out  times per week less than  minutes each time and Im in far better shape than most  years olds I know.  I dont go near a bench press anymore shoulders again and my workouts still consists of  sets of increasing weight for each exercise just like it did  years ago.  Yes its work to look good but not nearly as much as you think.  This is not investment banking where you need to work  hours a week to be good at it.  For just  hours youll be far ahead of  of the dudes out there and you dont need to cook your joints and connective tissue to do it.Work out keep disciplined and be safe.,TheRedPill,d0ga3gd,14,t5_2ve1u

6804383,0,t3_48y6wb,Genesis  is a very common tool used to beat husbands over the head.  The truth is that Christian men cant lead because they are not permitted to by the Christian subculture.I have been to many a bible study and listened to many a teaching on the topic.  Ive heard many pastors rebuke and exhort men at retreats and mens bible studies that they needed to man up!  take the lead! as well as exposit on their opinion of what a real man is.  Ive even seen pastors shame men for failing to meet a standard.  This is common.In the USA the blame is always assigned to the man.  Little to no attention is paid to the behavior of the wife.  For some reason the husband is responsible for the behavior of his wife if you didnt do this she wouldnt have done that its YOUR fault.This leads to a cycle of shame degradation self loathing and depression in the psyche of the husband.What is not well understood is that Christian women in our society are unwilling to follow.  As a Christian man putting your foot down is considered to be sinful because youre not showing proper compassion and care for your wife.  Or youll be accused of not listening.The wife will complain to the pastor and the pastor will side with the wife and blame the husband.  Even in your post you assign total and complete blame to the husband.  In my opinion youve been brainwashed to do this as I once was.Christian men are all to often told to get a grip and man up and lead and yet the very tools that they would use to do so are being withheld from them.Its like being told to change a tire so you reach for your wrench and someone says no its not right to use that So you keep trying to loosen the nuts by hand.  It just doesnt work.The majority of pastors and teachers when it comes to the subject are doing damage.

6940365,1,t1_d12szp9,What does any of this have to do with TRP?This looks like nothing but a trumpcirclejerk.What Trump has done is very simple hes created a cultofpersonality and instead of you guys opposing him as leaders you are following his lead like women and manginas.Very antitrp to be a follower of someone just because they can effectively use bullying skills.TRP isnt here to teach you how to manipulate voters in politics. And no one should ever praise someone for using TRPprinciples to control voters in politics and get results. You know why?  Because you have no idea what Trump truly believes.  What Trump believes and what he will do is essential to the office of the presidency. Not ... HOW he gets there. If you have no idea what Trump believes and youre not talking about his beliefs positions ideas... Then you are not discussing politics. You are expressing your cult attraction to him and showing your weakness as a man attraction to a confident leader despite not knowing anything about his beliefs.The very idea of a presidential campaign is about choosing someone WORTH following not someone who can manipulate people or attack people effectively. Yes we all know Trump can attack Hillary effectively.... so fucking what??? Politics is not a video game. Politics is real life and decisions have consequences. We choose a leader in this country as our founding fathers intended on ideas beliefs positions trustworthiness.We dont elect leaders based on their charisma their attractive qualities their effectiveness at bullying their effectiveness at inventing insults like little marco oh wow so genius! its like marco is little and he chose that adjective! wow lets applaud him!.The founding fathers put in the electoral collage to stop a candidate that might use the powers of bullying or corruption to get to the presidency. In fact the electoral college prevented Andrew Jackson a very dictatoresque character once in . But then they failed... Andrew Jackson became president... And do you remember what he was infamous for? For bullying people and his critics for getting what he wants despite it being bad for the country for dressing in a red cape and for the trail of tears and the Indian Removal Act for land... yes ethnic cleansing legal definition for land...Even if you hate hillarys guts at least you know generally what she probably believes liberalism leftist policies. Trump is unpredictable one day he changes his mind the next day he changes it again. We have no idea how he will behave as president other than be a narcissistic bully. Its like giving a stranger the keys to your home because of how effective he is at insulting people and how that made you laugh.If were having a discussion about presidency or politics without discussing ideas positions beliefs rational reasons and morality.

6973254,0,t1_d16pf29,gt So politically its an untenable position.Only since womens suffrage.  Its only since we gave women  control of suffrage that this has been the case.gtThe truth is they dont care about the children. If they did they would have been far more careful when choosing a mate. Instead theyre following their own selfish base impulses and then using their kids as pawns to exploit the altruism of a society unwilling to see children bear the burden of their mothers bad decisions.Heres a repost from me on that subjectWomen have always been attracted to the leader the alpha and even the rogue bad guy. Always.Its just that before womens suffrage changed our government to the point where women could get mens resources from men without having to keep the mans commitment by pleasing him these men were big risks for the woman to pursue. Sure the alpha guy would fuck her but would he stick around to support her children? As such the womans rational brains would temper these drives and impulses such that only women with poor impulse control would actively pursue these men.The rules have changed now and the boundary case is the majority of women boundary case those who change behavior due to change of rules. Now the majority of women are seeking these previously alpha men because even if they dont please him enough to secure his commitment government will secure his resources for her. Only women who think they have no chance of attracting an alpha man or those with extremely high levels of impulse control are those who go after the provider men.So the women of our society stop rewarding men who protect and provide and instead reward men who are not contributing to society who are less stable and who are more rebel like antiestablishment. Men of course react by becoming those types of men to be rewarded. Social stability takes a nosedive and well welcome to the deaththroes of western civilization.

6993827,0,t1_d18raiu,Maybe I have a different view on this whole thing but if my gf wants to take me to the mall it will only be if I want to go. Also I dont just disagree to do things that I dont want to do. Being an asshole and not accommodating at times on purpose isnt maintaining frame. I expect my gf to be receptive and want to do things that I want to do even if they arent her favorite. I will also do the same to a degree. If she wants to go to the mall and is taking too long I have no problem going to a store I enjoy or grabbing a drink at a restaurant bar. But straight up making the experience miserable by acting like a child is in no way maintaining frame. As a man sometimes you do things you dont necessarily want to do or arent really excited to do. You dont go whining about it. You do what you need to do and stand your ground when you feel you are being taken advantage of. If your girl never wants to do the things you want to do and is always giving you trouble when you bring it up you have a few choices. You can act like a child and make the experience harder which she will see right through. You could be receptive to the idea as long as she is receptive to yours. Or you should dump her because you shouldnt be with someone where you have to constantly change what you like and do things that you dont like if she isnt willing to do that. In my opinion if you have to act like a child with your girl to get her to do the things you want to do you need to leave her and start brushing up on the sidebar material right away because you did something wrong. She should want to do those things she doesnt like with you because that means she is with you. She should long to be with you. In turn you should do those things every now and then.

The risks involved the obligations and responsibilities and weighting them against the payout. And the simple truth is marriage is an INSANELY rotten deal for men nowadays. Theres a reason  of men arent getting married anymore. Because its a game immensely stacked at them which is still made worse by the day. Most of the laws usually read for mother and child this includes laws where they outlawed paternity tests around here on threat of incarceration. Laws where they try to rope you in for alimony simply for having lived with the women in question because man increasingly refuse to marry. This is very much an ongoing process with them constantly coming up with new ways to screw the husband over.

7062044,0,t1_d1gq75u,Speaking as a high functioning autist who has been involved in autistic communities before Next to nil. As the link in the OP points out autism is harder to detect in women than men so diagnosis rates are lower.Because autism includes a lack of social skills its easy for autistic women and men to get lost in the confusing mess of signals and unspoken words so its easier for us to not try than integrate. And when we try its easier to fuck up and figure its not worth it. This leads to autistic women to often looking worse not due to genetics but due to the lack of understanding how to improve the SMV with makeup and the like. This feeds into itself as their chances of getting a guy and adjusting decreases leading them to not knowing further lowering their chances.Then there is the matter of not knowing how to speak those unspoken words. We tend to speak literally and focus on little things that arent interested. A normal girl is going to shit test you and talk about girl stuff partying and the like. Autistic girls will struggle making shit tests and will likely not talk about normal shit.I have met HB autism spectrum women before. Ive met adjusted autistic women before. Ive even met a mix of both before they exist. But the chances are very slim and finding them in social situations that can stress them out and break their frames like clubs is unlikely.TLDR A mix of social unawareness and self feeding cycles that contribute to that mixed with similarities between autistic and female behavior leads to the amount of good looking autistic girls to be extremely small.

Single phone call all of  min and she was out.Stayed gone for  months I dont I even gotten off the couch in the meantime I was so devastated and then one day she came back Sorry I was crazy but now Im better lets try again. I took her back. Soulmates once more. We even got sober together I brought her into AA her sober birthday was  days after mine.  months of bliss. And then like clockwork exact same thing ghosted. Gone. Not even a call this time just a text Youll never hear from me again good luck with your life.and that was it. No fight the relationship was going perfectly fine we were totally in love didnt matter she just vanished. No explanation.

Now that Ive found the Red Pill I can perhaps explain her behavior somewhat but the bottom line is when she told me every day I love you and were gonna be together forever what she really meant was Right now I feel like I love you and were gonna be together forever however my feelings could change tomorrow or even in the next  minutes... This post only cements what I already knewinvesting in these women in ANY woman is like investing in a stock which can spontaneously implode at any moment. Generations ago there were checks and balances in place to keep this from happening. Nowadays not only is it not frowned upon by society its actively encouraged. Go on girl do it! Who cares if youre destroying another human being so what? Its YOUR happiness that counts YOLO!!!! Besides this new guy is like onetenth of a point cuter than the last one and thats the most important thing right?Great post OPlooking back I dont know what sort of story my exfiancee invented which justified her ghosting me but Im sure it was an elaborate sweeping epic inner monologue which painted me as the evil villain and her as the longsuffering heroine. I wonder what the trigger was for the light switch flip though... New cute guy at work? Friend suggesting she can do better? In the end I guess it doesnt really matter.Gents enjoy your time with them but dont get attached they can and will walk at any time and you will get no warning. The switch WILL flip eventually and when it doesyoure done.,TheRedPill,d1hegkj,8,t5_2ve1u

That doesnt happen by accident.Long before the trial began the defense team had combed through thousands of text messages emails social media messages statements to the police and media interviews. The defense culled them into a narrative and the narrative explained simply and understandably that the complainants were lying. It sounds simple but it is not. It takes countless hours of preparation. It takes good story telling. It also takes good legal work all that preparation could have been for naught if they werent able to shepherd the facts into evidence due to Canadas Rape Shield Law.The fact that the complainants attorneys turned over some additional evidence at the th hour certainly didnt hurt Ghomeshi but it shows a complete lack of understanding of legal work to pretend like Marie Heinlein and the defense team didnt know what they were doing.,TheRedPill,d1j48j9,16,t5_2ve1u

7082689,0,t1_d1j4vew,gt  How do you build discipline?Ill tell you right now its fucking hard.You have to become comfortable with discomfort and find something that you can repeat every day or every other day. Slowly as in months your level of discipline will compound itself.What is something repeatable you should be doing? You probably guessed it.ampnbspLiftingampnbspalmost a year ago i got a gym membership and for the first six months i religiously did monwedfri. Every week never missed a workout.ampnbsphere is where becoming comfortable with discomfort comes in.Going to the gym when you are motivated is easy. Its the days you dont want to go that tests you. This is the moment you build discipline. And it all comes down to an easy problem to answer.If i skip today Im indulging in my desires now but ill suffer tomorrow. If i go today Ill suffer now but tomorrow I will be better.Its the classic easy road or the hard road.There will be days when you arent motivated. When you want to just go home and pass out. When you say Ill lift tomorrow.Let me make it clear your excuse for not going isnt about lifting. Lifting weights is fucking easy. Getting there is the hard part. You arent skipping the gym because lifting is hard. You are skipping because you lack the discipline to follow through with your goals. You are indulging in short term satisfaction at the expense of lose of discipline and long term damage.Heres the thing though. When you revel in discomfort. When you go to the gym when all you want is to pass the fuck out in your bed. You start to realize your other weaknesses. You start to hold yourself accountable for your fuck ups.What fuck ups?You not going to be early and sleeping.Every day you force yourself to go to the gym when you sleep is one more reminder that it fucking sucks being tired and you should probably do something about that also.Over time this creates discipline and it will spill over to other areas of your life. You can apply this line of thought to anything. Once you hold yourself accountable for your actions you can then see your weaknesses and fix them.ampnbspFucking up attendance?ampnbsp Why?ampnbspWhat am i doing that is making me late?ampnbspdo i need to wake up  minute earlier?ampnbspDo i need to stop hitting the snooze button and just get the fuck up? I bet disipline would help thereampnbspCan I improve my sleep quality?ampnbspIs there an app for that? there is!ampnbspWhat causes sleep problems?ampnbspI should google sleep improvementampnbspLate for a meeting?ampnbspWhy?ampnbspwas i not paying attention to the time?ampnbspWas I on the internet fucking around?ampnbspMaybe i need to set alarms or create a schedule?ampnbspampnbspIt all comes down to holding yourself accountable. Something our society doesnt teach us anymore. Something we take for granted in k because we have an adult telling us every move to make.Then we get out into the real world and realize no one but ourselves is going to fix these things or help us. Its up to you to figure it out. And that cant be done if you lack discipline and accountability.So how do you build discipline? By reveling in the pain discomfort and struggles of life and being human. And then taking accountability for your shortcomings and fixing them.Once you have the mentality right everything else just falls into place.,TheRedPill,d1j6sqe,3,t5_2ve1u

7085775,0,t1_d1jhzaz,I understand what youre trying to say but the misapprehension you are labouring under is that there are good and bad women good women behave well bad women behave badly good women like nice courteous considerate men bad women like jerks etc. There arent good and bad women. Women are submissive if you want to be PC you can say conformist. They do what is expected of them by whoever they look to as the arbiter of values. This tends to be either a man they are with a religious community or authority or the group of women they socialize with. Theyre like water. They take the shape of the container they are in. What you call skanks are simply women whose natural urges are encouraged rather than channeled and restrained by their social environment. Everyone has urges to behave in antisocial ways. The difference is that men can be instilled with principles which causes them to restrain their own behaviour sometimes too much. But women cannot. So they can only behave in prosocial ways if there is a structure in place that rewards good behaviour and punishes bad behaviour.This means that sluts arent a particular type of woman who occurs at random as a percentage of a larger population. Sluts are ordinary women who were raised in an environment without slutshaming. And what you mistake for complaining about sluts is actually a strategy guide. We run down sluts constantly so that men who read will not feel protective of them or obligated towards them. Because sluts will use these feelings to lure men into committing to them. Theres nothing wrong with fucking sluts but committing to sluts is a bad idea. And men dont want to do it even before theyre taught why its a bad idea. Men only commit to sluts for two reasons They have few or no other sexual options and are attempting to secure a more regular supply of sex beggars cannot be choosers.  They feel obligated because the slut has played upon their feelings of protectiveness or because they think of sex as a favour to them and now they owe her. One of our goals as a subreddit is to protect men from these. ,TheRedPill,d1jjfok,3,t5_2ve1u

7089896,0,t1_d1js7i5,I promise it isnt magic and even your own body is full of elastic tissue. Im assuming youve been with a girl before and also assuming that she used a tampon at some point in her life after being with you without it falling out. Either her vagina is elastic and wasnt permanently stretched out by you or you have a dick the size of a tampon. A mother may be looser after having a kid but her vagina doesnt stay full baby sized either.And honestly regarding your anecdotal evidence the girls in Asia sound like they got tired of sleeping with you. When a woman is excitedorgasming her vagina will contracthug your wiener. Not super excited not so much wiener hugging. It probably goes against TRP but if you want to fuck a girl and feel her squeeze you from the inside you need to get her to climax.

7090847,0,t1_d1k3puy,Nah I aint white dude... Im first gen west African. Theres no way I got Euro blood in me. And thats still way different. If I was an American black with a random white dude here or there on my family tree who probably owned one of my ancestors in the first place I still wouldnt vibe with that shit.And before you tell me this aint my country in the first place I was born here and I served  years in the armed forces so I think I earned the right to call myself an American. But I have no love lost for the European white man. The more I learn about history the more angry I get. I used to think along the same lines as you. That we should unite against our common enemy. But at this point Im equally prepared to just watch everything burn. You just dont get it. My people are a conquered people from America to Jamaica to Brazil to Nigeria. Im not looking forward to some giant race war in the future. The race war has been happening for the past  years and your side continues to win. The Europeans raped Africa with guns and the Bible. Genocide slavery and the stealing of its natural resources. They redrew the borders and divvied it up among themselves. They committed genocide again and again and set up colonial rule that still affects those nations to this day. European decided borders that result in civil wars because warring tribes all of a sudden shared the same national identity. Oil companies and foreign banks that still in  are stealing oil and capital from the continent by empowering a small group of elites who steal the money from their nations and live like fat cats while the people suffer. All so European and US companies can continue taking oil and minerals.The Europeans pretty much wiped out the native populations of both the Americas and interbred to create the HispanicLatino race and also imported black African slaves. But even there the Latinos drink from the cup of white superiority and black Africans and sometimes tainos in SouthCentral America are looked at like total shit despite sharing culture history and language with their more EuropeanMestizo counterparts.So no we dont share ancestors and even if we did I wouldnt identify with European just because  out of  of my most previous direct ancestors was a European. Its easy to talk all that kumbaya shit when your group is the group in power. Its easy to say we should be color blind when your race hasnt shaped your experiences to nearly the same extent as that of a minority group. Your side won. Youre the default race. You dont have to think about racism and prejudice because it doesnt really affect you yet youre on your soapbox telling me what to think and how to feel.Imagine if Muslims conquered all of Europe killing or enslaving most Europeans then  years later told the remaining Europeans that they need to forget about the past and get along.

On the other hand Tim Cook is gay and isnt married doesnt have kids and he is a winner.Females are defined on their ability to be a mother. Since less women marry now due to hypergamy they are far less happy. By many objective measures the lives of women in the United States have improved over the past years yet we show that measures of subjective wellbeing indicate that womens happiness hasdeclined both absolutely and relative to men. The paradox of womens declining relative wellbeingis found across various datasets measures of subjective wellbeing and is pervasive across demographicgroups and industrialized countries. Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gapin happiness in which women in the s typically reported higher subjective wellbeing than didmen. These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emergingone with higher subjectivewellbeing for men,TheRedPill,d1obz8l,4,t5_2ve1u

Ill be happier if I just spend a quick  minutes touching myself. All these justifications are bullshit and I know that now... but when I get home from work on Tuesday and I know I have the house to myself for  hours... my retarded brain starts to beat out the smart one and that shitty shitty logic makes a whole lot of sense.We have to remove the idea that when we maturbate its a vitimless crime. Back when I was a kid and Catholic I remember a Priest talking to the boys about why masturbation was a sin. I was lucky and had a really cool young priest that was willing to talk to us about whatever. He equated masturbation to a sin of selfishness. It was a sin of only thinking of yourself.This might be going all over the place but I sort of feel the same way about weed and alcohol. These things arent inherently bad but can become destructive habits if left unchecked. So following that logic I have to start a new way of thinking. Masturbation Weed and Alcohol are not evilbad. They can be enjoyed occasionally by most people in a healthy way. I unfortunately am not like most people. I am likely addicted to masturbation. So I am not able to simply rub one out and go on. Im an addict and I need to act accordingly. One little session for me is as damaging as one little drink for my alcoholic uncle. ,TheRedPill,d1vu9g3,12,t5_2ve1u

7237844,0,t1_d20u9ui,Its not an unfair stigma. You were already married. That means some other guy was inside you regularly and likely did everything in the playbook with you that alone can bug many men when they think of it. It can be hard for a guy especially bluepills to accept a woman that had a few onenightstands let alone a woman that was with a particular person for years. Here at TRP I learned to inquire about past relationships a woman who only sleeps with one guy at a time but has a high turnover rate is barely above the woman who just outright sleeps around. But a woman who was faithful to a single partner for a long time thats just a notch below getting a woman who hasnt dated ever at all and is a fairly good sign. Think of it from the perspective of a man. A woman is a risk. Many are going MGTOW simply because false rape accusations and financial burdens are fairly high risk in the current environment. Some men literally give up because interactions with women do not pass the costbenefit analysis. Make yourself worth it for the man that is the best advice I can give if you want to attract one. All women know how to make men happy many just refuse to. I point out to single mothers who give the craziest kinkiest and most abundant sex a man will ever experience all while cooking his meals and massaging him etc. She does this because she is attempting to lock him down and many examples exist how those women cut off all that good stuff once the guy is locked down.

Yes Im abstaining now until marriage. Just like the entrepreneurial catch phrasefollow the money go places that are breeding grounds for this kind of upbringing or go to places they gather. Rural areas catholic chapels theyre the heaviest on virginity. The best place is university sororities moreover christian uni sororities. Although they have a feminist aura nowadays with their stupid activism and sisterhood Ive encountered more virgins than a dead suicide bomber because of the social circle of my LTR. Dont give up hope men. They are out there and they want families. Mine wants to be a stay at home mom despite having the most impressive resume of any college sophomore at her uni. Theyre much easier to game than your average bitch as long as you can adjust to their different pace. Do not treat them like normal plates but keep the dominance and proof strong. They are fragile naive and will clam up if youre too aggressive on them. Give them time.Ill be making a more in depth and instructive post on this in the future.

Are you worried about someone researching your post history or something?gt There is a difference between fantasy and reality.Yes quite correct however the current Accepted Narrative about sexual politics is fantasy as well.  Thus while Ezra Klein wants you to feel a spike of fear when youre undressing a girl the greater reality is that a lot of LMR is just for show  under a strict definition its all for show but one imagines a situation where a man might take genuine resistance for LMR.Politically Incorrect Statement of the Day No very often means keep going and at the moment where she is letting you remove her panties it means Dont give up now!While the Accepted Narrative demands that a man summon at Uber for the woman at the very first moment he senses a psychic vibration of a no or even a hint of reluctance thats not how men and women relate on a sexual level.  It will leave a lot of guys with blue balls and a lot of women wondering why they didnt get fucked especially after they let a guy buy them drinks and the take her back to his room for the express purpose of...getting fucked.Guys who understand the difference between no means no and LMR are going to be much happier and have much happier  and wellfucked  girlfriendsplatesLTRS.VZ Klein is to sex as Tim Wise is to race a horrific fraud.

7292942,0,t3_4f8ruk,In theory the prosecution still must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. In practice if a girls says he raped me that is it then the burden shifts to unprove what she said.  There is even a specific section in the Canadian Criminal Code that says a single witness without corroboration can be enough to prove a point beyond a reasonable doubt. That was inserted specifically so that a lone female could get a guy convicted on her word alone with no additional evidence and judges have to inform the jury of that.The other thing about affirmative consent is that it is so awkward it is basically unbelievable to listen to a guy explain how he asked for it and received it at every stage. . .even if he did in fact do so. Its such a mood killer outside of some BDSM scenarios that nobody does it ergo all sexual encounters are rape and it is just a matter of whether the girl pursues it or not after the fact.As far as the standard of proof is concerned balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence is the civil standard. Assault including sexual assault is a tort and therefore can be pursued in civil court using that standard think OJ who was not convicted of murder but found liable for unlawful death.The thing is kangaroo courts have a whacked out concept of evidence and probabilities. They have biases that lead them to all sorts of stupid decisions.  Not all administrative tribunals are macropodine.  Housing tribunals tend to be ok although the laws themselves are usually slanted against landlords as are employment tribunals but labour tribunals tend to be prounion.

From an outside perspective and someone who has had a shitty hand in life as well I really recommend you get a professional. Does not have to be someone to hand you medicine but you need to talk to someone that will help give you strategies to unfuck your inner self. I had to have a ton of help to unfuck my inner self redpill helps but a professional will expedite the process. You have to create a positive mentality despite all you have been subject to and it will be rough and you will need someone to be there to hear it give you objective feedback as to whether your thouhhs are irrational or not and wont get fed up with you dumping all your heavy shit on them. They will also give you ways to filter your internal monologue that helps give you a foothold while rebuilding yourself.Thanks for the post. Please dont dismiss this comment I am certain a therapist will help you and you dont need to feel any sort of bad for seeing one. Make the effort. You shared your experience here with this post here and I learned a bit from it.  Please take my post that comes from my experience and give it some honest thought.Trying to figure out everything bouncing around in you is going to be tough and it will take a long time but it can be smoothed out by just talking to someone who is trained to give you objective feedback.Sometimes our thoughts and reactions to bad events are completely rational at the time.but sometimes the experiences linger and create in us thoughts and assumptionsthat becomeirrational during new experiences.

Im advocating masturbation but I dont masturbate anymore. I feel more in control though for most people its good to release tension instead of getting desperately horny.gtgt If youre intelligent and say intelligent things shell pick up on it and recognize your intellectual superiority without you needing to do anything else. She may even say something about it Nope never happened. They dont respond to intelligent things. If they reply its in a dumb way. Without interpunction. You cant imagine how many times conversations went to shit because they wrote  sentences in one and expected me to understand what they mean. And the grammer. Unbelievable how little effort they make and they know its unattractive! Having that said most girls Ive met or chatted with waited for me to start conversations. Its frustrating but Ive come to terms with the fact thats how things are with women. But then again my SMV is probably not high enough. Despite giving up drinking smoking running a lot and lifting nothing has changed in all these years. Waiting for the great white buffalo now  Im in the acceptance stage now. gtgtStandards are different for men and women because men and women are different. A man that sleeps with many women is following a biological imperative and if his standards are high and his SMV is as well women will respect rather than revile him for it see George Clooney. The reverse is not true. Slut behavior is not social proof its the opposite.The classic example. Yes its true and it shows how fucked some men are. Facial aesthetics play a huge role in this.In the end women make the choice men have to present themselves at their best. Hell even a fat whale thinks she deserves Brad Pitt and wont settle for an average or subaverage which would be her match male. Sickening statistics when you look at dating site survey results.Ive got to go maybe Ill reply more later. Thanks anyway you wrote a lot. Maybe I shouldve said that Im aware of all TRP theory its just that Im distancing myself more and more. Yes Ive had some sex and Id like to say its thanks to TRP but looking back it was more because of a logical development which was the result of negative experiences. ,TheRedPill,d2ht9w0,0,t5_2ve1u

7424119,0,t3_4gy1ud,Hypergamy ruins relationships more so than the male strategy of having sex with everyone even if neither are acted upon.  The reason is that men can be around women that they find more attractive than their wife yet still find their wife as attractive as they always did and still want to be with her.  It is more easily compartmentalized.   However let a woman leave her husband and go to work each day with a much more attractive man and see how her feelings change toward her husband.  It is because they are not wired to have a harem that they sex.  I am on my break at work now.  A younger woman that is married is obviously very attracted to me here.

Each time my chosen career came under fire I learned that I could not define myself by it. Each job is just a learning opportunity and stepping stone for the next job.  I started off as a graphic artist right when that job was dying. I quickly switched over to a D animator.  From there I became an editor the a marketing producer and videographer.  Im currently transitioning to digital marketing and Im starting to get paid to edit short films.   I learned that I cannot stay married to one job title.

Mini golf bowling arts festival gallery stroll go to the arcade whatever. Stuff like this frames the date as fun. If the conversation goes stale you can focus on the activity as opposed to sitting in awkward silence as youve found out on your food date. Activities also makes Kino much easier. When you first see her start with the easiest one a hug. The next easiest one I like is when you open a door for her guide her in with your hand on the small of her back. After that touch her leg or arm when you are about to say something. Playful bumps shoves get creative and keep escalating to the kiss thats bound to happen. One other big thing is to be relaxed and comfortable even if youre not. This is effective not just on dates but any social situations. It will help put everyone at ease yourself included and help the convo flow. Keep at it and youll be slaying in no time. ,TheRedPill,d2s987r,1,t5_2ve1u
7478647,0,t3_4hsqvc,Great post OP! I want to add something complementarygt I started lifting eating and bulking not for them and their whimsical desires but for the disdain I had for myselfPsychological research suggests that hardworking people arent the ones who can postpone gratification for the future like they used to believe. Hardworking and conscientious people are the ones who work hard because they hate going down their perceived image of a loser.Since youre reading Illimitable Men he basically admitted it in the post called How to be happygtAmbition is useless if it serves to depress you for not achieving it. Ambition goals need incentive to avoid being a loser.The reason why people like TRP and are sticking in the longterm is because the body of knowledge they acquire from here translates into action that improves them. Therefore its necessary to at least have the concept of how someone you dont want to be behaves. In our case this is what a blue pill man is who puts women as a priority bends to their whims and needs opts to avoid working out and taking care of his body and has no money influx to be financial  independent.People learn and adapt out of necessity. They learn when they realize that what they know and what they do doesnt produce the desired results.

7482863,0,t1_d2snr8h,The best Podcast are the ones that started as a hobby or out of passion. I love podcast and also started my own. I felt somewhat confused about the process when I fist started so let me know if you need any help or have any questions. I am curious next time you have the Dr on. Ask him of he read Sex at Dawn by Dr. Christopher Ryan. Its an extremely interesting book and I think it has intelligible arguments against some accepted theory regarding female sexual behavior and desire. For example the bill balls theory size determines sexual proclivity. Bonobos are a matriarchal society. Males and females sleep around with everyone. They use sex to dissolve tensions and ease social conflicts. So even thought the females are in charge they still sleep around. The book is really good and has lots and lots of great scientifically based arguments about female sexuality. One strong point that really made me ponder. Why would a female not want to increase the success chances of her offspring with genetic diversity? Should she also want to have offspring with various males to get a nice genetic mix? Isnt it assumptions to say that in a tribal culture with no property no money nothing but food and maybe basic shelter that the burden of children is not that much more for females then males? The tribe would assist and take care of the children. They dont have much to do anyway besides hunt eat explore and fuck. If a female is in a tribe and has no fear of abandonment or denial of resources why would she choose just one make to copulate with? Males would actually have no idea who fathered any individual child. This concealment would actually benefit the children through group cooperation. You need to protect your brother and your brothers children because if you die at least half your genes spread through your brothers genetic line. If sex is plentiful resources not restricted then shared group work and sexual genetic diversity works well for both men and woman. We must assume that working in group was superior to working individually. And human love to be in groups we fear being ostracized from the group because that could mean death for the individual. An over assertive alpha male could be rejected if they were out of control. But without a sense of property what would there be a need to control? Im not doing the book any justice but I would like to hear his thoughts if he has read the book.  ,TheRedPill,d2srd78,2,t5_2ve1u

Seems like pretty big privilege to me.   So if she is capable of working but decides not to or is capable of working full time but decides it is more fun to teach zumba or some goofy shit  times a week instead of working full time. The judge will invalidate your prenuptual and force you to pay her alimony.  If you are lucky your non severability clause in the prenup is written well and the rest of the prenup stays valid if it isnt they invalidate the whole thing and she gets half your assets that you came into the marriage with.

7569005,0,t3_4izba9,Let me explain TRP is apolitical and amoral for good reason if we want to understand whats really going on in interactions and understand the social dynamics of attraction and relationships we need to look at it objectively. We try to see past things in order to see the reality beneath.Political ideologies and morality are intangible man made constructs that you apply to reality. They do not make up reality but they can indirectly influence reality. To understand reality we must strip these things away. This is why when political topics come up we have to tread a reasonably fine line to avoid allowing political ideology to creep in ahead of objectivity. It is the same reason we demand moralising of actions be left at the door.Note that while we demand this on the sub were happy for you to hold whatever political views you like outside of the sub. Same goes for morality. I actually encourage people to have some moral standard or code that they adhere to. I dont care specifically what it is but Im a believer that the act of rationalising right or wrong of your behaviour according to your circumstances is a very feminine trait. The masculine equivalent is to decide how you will conduct yourself and then stick to it. Men are like rocks but women are merely water their actions swayed by their feels.Thats a little by the by but its relevant to the point Im building to. The reality is that as TRP grows it becomes a more prominent subculture. Specifically a part of the counterculture. Both the sub and the leaders have no control over this if they wish the sub to grow and more men to be able to become men through the help and advice the sub provides. Once we reach a critical mass whether the members of TRP or the ECs or the Mods like it or not... we become a part of the current culture war.Cultural changes have impacts upon the success levels of political ideologies. Its why socialism became flavour of the month for a number of years and then things swing back to conservativism and then liberalism and so on and so forth. Essentially as TRP grows we will have an indirect political impact whether we like it or not.Now look at the way the sub is led and moderated. Theres a strong belief in keeping things ontopic and a careful hand preventing blue pill ideas from starting to infiltrate the sub. As things change the sub adapts. New rules are put in place. New methods of enforcement are used. Additional flairs are added. A new offreddit site is created as a backup. These are guys who adapt and solve problems as they present themselves.Now my third and final basis. The current political movement for change in this regard MRAs. Basically the MRA badge is poison. I have nothing against them all personally. I am of the opinion that I dont care about them. I agree with GLOs assessment that theyll never achieve anything because theyre not attractive enough. The reality is half the electorate is women and women follow their feefees everywhere including selfdestruction. Theyll literally just vote for pretty men for being pretty and theyll vote against unattractive men because theyre unattractive. Obviously therell be specific exceptions but for the most part the typical airheaded woman will follow what Ive suggested. So the MRA movement is basically doomed from the outset. The only time they get support is when they phrase things well enough to do with equality that people want to virtue signal so theyll side with them. But the MRAs are very bad at doing this. Their argumental style is too logicbased and not emotive enough. They lack  parts of the perfect argument.Put all of this together and you have a situation where TRP will eventually adapt get involved in the culture war then have political influence. However it will be on TRP terms. Were not likely to go searching for it or team up with the MRAs... but if our cultural influence continues to grow well get it whether we want it or not. Once that happens or maybe before well adapt as needed. For now though were staying neutral.,TheRedPill,d32k4r9,9,t5_2ve1u

It was one of the things he taught me even though all I had of a relationship was letterwriting that took months round trip.My grandfather on my fathers side lived in an occupied country as well and he did well for himself.  Not millionaire status but enough to pay for a home for his  kids and educations for all of them and a tiny bit of assistance in setting them up once they moved out.  Neither of my parents grew up wealthy but they had consistency and came to the US to try something different.gt You are able to lead the standard of life you do because you live in a country that is based on somewhat democratic values has had  years of voting and so on.Ive worked in the Middle East since the s off and on under dictatorships and made money.

Granted the people that go are NOT your bombshells or anything like that. Some super slut I had a ONS with was telling me about how she went the prior weekend and had like  married dudes run train on her since she was the youngest one there at . But if it happens publicly you can bet your sweet ass it happens privately. I still remember the stories of my sophomore year at a small private liberal arts school of  freshman girls who banged often all at once countless guys in their triple including one another. They were responsible for spreading a huge chlamydia outbreak singlehandedly too. I remember when I got the offer at some party I threw EARLY on before it was out of hand but turned it down because by that point I was happily fucking my second girl ever who was light years hotter than my first girlfriend. If it happened at my school you better believe it was happening somewhere at yours. Best part is they all have boyfriends now who have NO idea. One is new but settled down by junior year one has been around as some military guy since like her sophomore year and the third didnt settle down and fucked freshman guys until she graduated but recently snuggled up to some alpha guy by lying her ass off and playing the innocent card.

You may pull the occasional new age hippie chick who believes bathing and tampons arent natural and survives on a steady diet of ditch weed and tofu but thats pretty much it.  TRP is about ambition.  This post implies that somehow men who strive to win and achieve somehow lose in the long run.  This is fallacious.  If you need to rough it to get a foothold in a new career while training great.  I should settle for a twin bed with  Indian roommates?  Fuck you.  Im better than that.  Ive owned  vehicles outright in my life at .  I lived comfortably in a nice apartment with a ghost of a roommate for two years before my seizures started.  I take pride in my existence and my lifestyle.  Why?

7770053,0,t3_4lqahq,I dont think you got the point. The point of the OP from the relationships subreddit is that women trickle truth sexual history.  This is why you ask about relationship history directly when you are considering LTRing a girl.  Its also why you double or triple the number of sex partners she admits to. You are never going to get an accurate report from any women even the best ones on sexual history.  Its also why in addition to asking directly you just get with your girl and you talk about sex and sexual history over drinks.  You will get a lot more information by making her very comfortable and by lubricating her with alcohol.   You dont interrogate you just have a back and forth a conversation about sex and sexual history.  Youll be astonished at the info you get when you go at it this way.   When she feels comfortable with you shell divulge much.   When youre interrogating her under klieg lights shell clam up.  Asking todays modern American woman to take responsibility for  her sexual history and to be honest and forthcoming about it is ridiculous.   That is not going to happen mostly because most women were never trained and taught to take responsibility for them.  Some expressly encourage women to lie about their sexual histories to men for the specific purpose of getting men into LTRs and marriages.  To these people sexual history is unimportant it doesnt matter when it comes to relationships.   And its funny  these are the same people who say that when it comes to sexual choice and the threat of sexual violence sex is the most important thing ever and we must never ever denigrate or downplay these things.  We must not do anything to interfere with womens sexual choices.   We must always support women in reporting and standing against sexual violence and sexual assault.  I wouldnt have so much of a problem with her sexual history as I do with her dishonesty about it.   Its not the sex honey its your lying.   She lied by omission to a potential husband about her sexual history.  She led him to believe she was a virgin when that was not the case.   Thats the real problem here.  The lying and dishonesty and lying by omission are the things that prevent and preclude a real relationship at least the kind of relationship a long term malefemale relationship implies.   There is supposed to be a level of honesty trust disclosure and intimacy that would cause a woman to divulge a history like this.  Her failure to disclose it honestly indicates she doesnt care about him doesnt love him and doesnt respect him.   Men most women dont care about you dont love you and dont respect you enough to be honest about their pasts with you.   They are either too afraid to disclose it because of their fears of judgment and rejection or they just dont respect most men enough to come clean about it.   Thats the real problem here and the real takeaway.  ,TheRedPill,d3pe5ce,39,t5_2ve1u

Game and manipulation are only minor parts of the redblue pill sexual dynamic. A massive part of TRP beyond learning game is striving to better ones self working out reading socializing nofap etc... in such a way to become a greater masculine force.In other words while the psychological aspects of TRP oriented towards courting game i.e. are integral to TRP itself they are not the sole substance there of.

The final straw was when she wanted me to come away to her home country for Christmas and when I refused she booked tickets for herself and the kid without telling me until it was too late.I was lucky in that we didnt marry and after ending it I had a rent free year in my uncles house. Also I didnt burn our relationship to the ground so we are still on good terms share the parenting burden and do each other favours not sexual. I have to pay child support but it is not a lot because I have custody two or three nights a week.Still I think it was a great decision. For starters our kid is not going to grow up in a house with people who hate each other like the two of us had in our respective childhoods.

He was abnormally tall something like . There are women out there who basically look for the tallest guy in the room and just try to make sure hes not autistic. He fit a fetish for many women so by putting himself out there he was bound to run into one by the end of the night. He was distinctive due to his style and stature. A lot of the time the only thing a guy needs to do is distinguish himself. To his credit he did a good job characterizing this.

Anywhere from a few weeks to a few years after its creation assuming its given ample resources for growth and development and doesnt want to destroy us all either maliciously or innocently we will have the worlds first artificial superintelligence.From that point mankind becomes more or less irrelevant.  The best chess player has been a computer for  years.  The best Go player is now a computer.  In  years the best scientist doctor writer filmmaker video game developer car designer rocket scientist will be a computer.  Either a single one or many multiple artificial intelligences.Fusion power if possible will be available.  If not solar power efficiency will be boosted by orders of magnitude.  Essentially just go watch Transcendence with Johnny Depp because thats whatll happen.  Transcendence is probably best case scenario.  He was a benign unguided superintelligence that was genuinely working to make the world better.  The people plugged into him were free to go at any time and not held hostage they just actually realized likely because he took the time to explain to them how much better humanity could become if they would assist him.Fusion of man and machine in that way will almost certainly happen.Mars will be the first colonized planet where humans did not originate and the ASI artificial superintelligence will help us colonize it.  From there theres really no telling just how wild things get.At age  Im hoping Ill be alive to see all this.  I suspect I will be since all my elderly aunts and uncles are living to   etc. and my oldest living relative just passed away at .  Someone in this thread quoted Michael Crichton.

I like myself better i like taking pictures for the first time in my life i can dance  and jump and move my body like..a normal human being which i was previously too heavy to do. I get the idea that certain people in your life should value and love you for who you are at your core but...that kind of thinking is exactly what this sub is about changing right? You are a person with an ascribed value in society like it or not . The more attractive sociable and successful you are the better ALL people will respond to you and in fact the better YOU will respond to yourself.I was big most of my life so for me people treating me nicely women maintaining eye contact and getting real IOIs is new.

It does not want you to go to the gym because it will hurt. It does not want you to spend countless hours learning a skill because you could spend all that time eating cake and jacking off instead. It doesnt think about the longterm because obviously in the long term it is much more useful for you to learn a skill instead of eating cake and jacking off but it doesnt piece all that together. All it says is you are wasting your time doing something you are bad at when you could be eating cake and jacking off.Your id isnt necessarily a bad guy its just not a long term thinker.

8090751,0,t3_4py59u,For the record i love the frankfurt school and while this may go against what the agenda of the subreddit is generally about i dont really see this as a bad thing. In the grand scheme complacency is both a saving grace and a bit of an existential crisis. That was the whole point of Clockwork Orange taking something organic like a human and making them into a machine that served societys interest. I for one think humans are horrible to each other. I get that aggression is what wins in nature raw power all that jazz. But for all the good weve done weve done a lot worse. Im pessimistic about the future i think its going to be a Brave New World sorta future it already is in terms of intimate relationships between people. As someone who did go to college and experience all that the article mentioned i think the only difference with me is that the liberals i was around were into all these topics for the sole purpose of raising their SMV and getting laid. God forbid i remind a SJW of something they said that was extremely rascist when we were out drunk in downtown. If theres anything to take away from this its that its not just the liberal agenda or whatever that you should worry about. Its the flipside as well everyone tells you how you should think and just because one person uses big dick politics and sounds all hoo fucking rah to you doesnt make you any less of a beta that you pretend youre not.

LGBT oppression politics are cancer.   White guilt politics are cancer.We are seeing the destruction of western white civilization.You guys need to fight the cancer.  We need men to stand up and set the narrative again.  We need rationality to make a comeback.Stop the destruction of our society.Frankly what you are all witnessing is the fabled beta uprising.  Yes thats right.  Beta uprising will not take the form of angry eliot rogers types shooting girls.  It will take the form of pathetic betas ya I know ironic I say this idc its whatever I put myself in a different class altogether trying to destroy western civilziation.  Trying to undermine the masculine pillars that our society is built on that made our society great in the first place.  They will socially conform to the new narratives and destroy everything because hating masculinity hating white people white culture hating the west hating strong men with beauitful families and normal children this makes them feel  slightly less worthless.  This goes for those who do all these things simply to conform to our new social media virtue signalling world as well.  Also I am mostly talking about white betas.Nonwhites will do all this in general on a mass trend not everyone everywhere as well but they will do it because they dont care what happens to western civilzation because they did not build it.  They are like a millenial living off his parents while going to protests to tear down the system that enriched his parents. But lots of gay guys are pretty chill and hate pride and all this bs.  They arent rare but they are quiet.  And guess what they happen to be masculine  of the time.  Masculinity  rationality  stability  prosperity.,TheRedPill,d4ukzbs,1,t5_2ve1u

8155645,0,t1_d4wyl78,Makes sense.  Look I get where youre coming from and probably  of people trying to swallow the pill are right where you are.  The following is what you and they all must at one point accomplishYou need to INTERNALIZE that acting with abundance mentality is what works BEST for keeping women you like around.  INTERNALIZE this.  And keep beating your brain with this.  And you still wont believe it.  No matter how hard you try.  Not subconsciously at least.  Youll still be afraid of ignoring her telling her to fuck off etc. etc. because you fear of losing her.  Youll only start believing it ONCE youve already been Alpha with  chicks and its gone great each time.  Your brain only accepts it once its seen anecdotal evidence of the fact.  INSTEAD just come to peace with the fact that you WILL do it regardless of what your brain tells you.  You will follow TRP guidelines regardless of the fact that at the moment you feel like its the inferior choice.  Once youve done this then its basically easy mode.  You no longer have a choice you just act.  And whenever anything resembling a shit test comes along ask yourself WWCD or What Would Chad Do?.  The answer is usually nexting her.  So next her and if she comes back apologizing WHICH SHE WILL YOU WILL BE SHOCKED then reanalyze if you want to give her another chance.  I dont mean to next her for any small shit test but for when she does unacceptable things like not complying with your way of leading over and over for shit tests there are other posts that detail how to handle them.So in essense just act Red Pill because youve promised yourself you will.  If every time a shit test comes around you have to think is TRP really the way I want to handle this... what if she gets upset and never comes back what if... what if... you will fail.  And this has to be done FROM DAY ONE.  Because if youve been beta for  months turning Red Pill means shit to her because her concept of you WILL NOT CHANGE EASILY.  It will not.  She has her first second third and thirtieth impression of you.  She will see through it.In essence its  million times easier starting from scratch with a new girl.  And when you do MAKE SURE you force yourself to be AF  of the time. ,TheRedPill,d4x054n,1,t5_2ve1u

8162322,0,t1_d4xttp7,honestly it comes down to your pallet. what do you want. think of basic geography when you buy something where is it from?A very common cheap bottle of wine is Malbec. Now in about  of restaurants it will come from Mendoza Argentina and be a fairly cheap glass.Malbec is dry tart and slightly sweet. It tastes this way as its massively produced and argentina is the largest producer of Malbec in the world. So they quickly grow it in a hot climate which leads to fast fermentation of the grapes and the natural heat drys it out. it becomes tart as most wine makers will let the skins sit in the pressed grapes to give color flavor and the bite your cheeks feel having the moisture taken out.when it comes to brand there are millions. more than likely you just need to figure out where your wine is from and that should give you the basic characteristics. if you are in the USA total wine does wine tastings on the weekend have classes as well. those are free. overall you need to just taste taste taste and figure it out.price does not mean amazing wine.,TheRedPill,d4xu6my,3,t5_2ve1u

8164907,0,t3_4qsx2f,I get it theres allot of women around. Honestly the glass is already broken and Im breaking it on purpose all the time.Recently an old girl from school contacted me making small talk we all know whats up. Shes been single for a long time became a waitress parties allot nowadays. Shes pretty decent looking honestly most betas would be excited. Obviously shes interested in giving me a shot and if I were to play my game right its easy prey.And yet I couldnt give a flying fuck. Ive considered downright ignoring her responses four times already. Which results in me staying silent for about half the day until part of me says should at least say something bro. Then I groan and type some half assed response. Figuring that this line will be the one where shell finally flake on hopingpraying. But no predictably my uncaring game seems to be working flawless and Im getting great responses. I really couldnt care two shits if this girl walked up and left or stayed. And of course this is the exact reason why shes been orbiting around me. This has happened dozens of times in the years. It was prevalent in my single period prior to finding the sub yet it magnified postTRP. Im even guilty of this with plates and short term relationships. When a girl starts to bore me and it often does I just flip a switch in my head and become an automatic reply robot. Ill begin making every so evasive attempts to put distance and more time in between dates and messages. Often times I try to make her blow up so I can Wiley Coyote out of there. It has worked a grand total of two times up till now. For comparison in my past relationship I appeared to have a natural talent for agitating the girl and making her go all Pompeii on my ass. Took me zero effort I averaged about twenty eruptions per week and I still didnt ditch her. Ive almost reached the point where Id begin dropping platesbench warmers who honestly havent done anything wrong except for showing high interest in me.Sure allot of them act hurtangryconfusedtearfulsurprised etc. And you now what I really couldnt give a shit. Every seat I empty can be replaced with a minimum of effort. Right now I dont even know what Im looking for or why Im doing this. Its not even about the sex anymore.  Women have left me completely empty and devoid of any significance. After fucking theres really no other level Id like to reach with any of them. Even if I begin to date them or turn them into a short term fling I still view them like some nameless girl. Perhaps relationships are a product of the st century and there werent any back in the old amp ancient days. That this is just the default mode where a man and woman would function in.Ah Cypher you were right. Ignorance is bliss. ,TheRedPill,d4y5uqf,1,t5_2ve1u

However what ever I give is to get a return. What you called cooperation I call selfishness. You are actually playing by the very same rules that I am. That is true because you wouldnt have stated the law unless you were doing it for yourself. This is the point that youre missing. You call it doing for the group when the eventual outcome is in fact selfish. You know you must do whatever it is to win how is it not a game? There are strategies and rules no? There is an eventually winner and a loser no? Thus you are not doing for the group all youre doing is playing the game to their tune to maximize your prize. You are gaming them when you understand the efforts put in. When you understand how to play them and the proportion at which youve done something compared to what theyve done.The entire world is a game. Everything. It is when people become so involved in these games that they forget that theyre playing and take it too seriously.Youre just looking at it different than me.

There are broke losers with game drowning in pussy. Money has utility and money can provide freedom and options. However each man needs to decide what kind of life style he wants to live and what he is willing to do to live that lifestyle. It sounds to me that the philosophy prof didnt manage money well. Its possible to earn k a year live comfortably and accumulate at least  million dollars in  years. Making kyr and hating your life is not worth it. There is more to life than money. Follow your passion is bad advice if you cant utilize your passion to support yourself. Follow and pursue the money just so you can have a lambo is bad advice as well. There are many things that make life rich fulfilling and meaningful. Ferraris and mansions are great to have but one can have those things and still be miserable and shit with women. To have anything requires sacrifice  timeeffortbloodsweat tears. We all have to make the judgement as to what pursuits are worthy of our time and what results we can expect. Most men will not be millionaire bad asses so the pursuit of being a millionaire worth it if you dont have what it takes? I think this can be foolish advice. Btw can we ask what your net worth iswhat your financial condition looks like? Heres a snapshot from my mint   yr old engineer who Lives internationally for work Earns k  Saves  of his income annually I work as a contractor  for self employment tax  for health insurance  for other insurances mostly business related the other  is for living expenses travel etc  Has traveled to thirty different countries  Has meaningful and fulfilling relationships with close friends mostly other men a few married couples. You can have a job and accumulate wealth. You can have a job you dont like and still live well. You can have a job that isnt fulfilling and yet find fulfillment in other places. Here is some pragmatic resources on how to accumulate wealth. Given enough time anyone can do it. Common advice is that you saveinvest  of your income for thirty years. I suggest going even higher than that  On assets that generate cash. About a janitor who died with  million in investments. Granted he lived a bit miserly but it is possible to accumulate wealth into old age even with a less than stellar salary. On index funds being the best option for investing for the average person.

We are all taught not to rape both by implication which is the most powerful as anyone capable of moral reasoning beyond the level of childhood can figure out that rape is wrong and sometimes explicitly.What it really is an attack on male sexuality. It is often paired with statements expanding the concept of rape and sexual misconduct to absurd limits and claims that the rapepositive aspects of our culture are implicit so no Johnny its okay to screw a passed out girl if she isnt a virgin but more a societallevel implication that its okay to take advantage of girls in ways it would not be considered by society okay to take advantage of boys because society allegedly sees women as lesser and that girls are groomed to be easily manipulated into sex because you know sex in the English speaking world is bad and like an evil force that comes from outside making you less pure.You are correct it is absurd. At best hatefilled misandrists and their unwitting accomplices are claiming that we have a society that normalises exploitation of women. Nevermind that their concept of exploitation is problematic in the extreme or that it takes culpability away from women themselves for participating in the natural formation of the sexual marketplace.They hate and fear male sexuality. It is incredibly easy to teach men not to rape given a reasonable definition of rape and sexual assault. If fact we in the West do it without even trying. Bad apples will always exist and no amount of Dont you rape no girls Johnnyboy will change them. We teach men not to rape quite naturally as an extension of respecting others  their bodies their property  and the fact that our culture punishes violence and blatant exploitation that harms the exploited when done by an individual.The myth of Rape Culture is a form of hate speech. Im not against hate speech mostly to avoid the slippery slope that the concept represents but Ill call a spade a spade. Normal healthy male sexuality is demonised. A hashtag like the one you described is an expression of hate and fear not of rapists but of the natural order.

The point is is that youre taking stupid things like crossing legs and applying a gender label to it.  Is it masculine? Or is it feminine?  Who gives a fuck?  If you believe its masculine then so will everyone else.Edit To add more context to the situation I am Polish living in America.  My entire family is from Poland.  Whenever we meet up for lunch or a get together you will notice that the majority of men sit with the legs crossed.

If you tell a depressed person just to stop being such a downer no doubt theyll flip shit at you but as Marcus Aurelius put it The obstacle is the way.

The red pill opened my eyes to the realities of the sexual marketplace so I hit the gym every day because I understand attraction is necessary for me to satiate my primitive desires fucking HBs. Outside of this I am a slave to nothing but my scientific goals. I will work toward those goals until I die so if youre an alpha male who hits the club every week good for you but get the fuck out of my way because your social status is worth next to nothing in my mind. I understand that in terms of social market value my scientific work means nothing to societyothers until I monetize it. But I judge my quality of life by my legacy and not my social status or even my happiness for that matter.

8544820,0,t3_4wsivh,Excellent post.gt Hey hows it going?  Thats it. Simple right? This approach has a high success rate.Bland openers are the best.  You dont feel like a dumbass using them so its easy for beginners to hold frameremain confident.  They require no special delivery or timing.  No one is going to mishear the key part and ask you WHAT? sucking the humor out of the line.  And most importantly it lets you know right away if she finds you physically attractive.  If a Louis CK clone starts talking to a woman shes probably going to laugh her ass off and keep the conversation going but that initial interest is a false positive  at the end of the night she probably still doesnt want to go home with him because hes a lumpy balding redhead.  His game was good enough to get a foot in the door but hes fighting a losing battle.  If he started with a bland opener the woman would have rejected him early and saved his time.  On the flipside if he started with a bland opener and she did want to keep talking to him he could be pretty certain that shes interested in him physically as hes given her no other reason to stick around.  One other thought  a lot of guys will be asking OK so once Ive said hello and started the conversation then what do I say?  Whats worked for me is.  Whatever the topic is get into the details and.  Never miss an opportunity to pursue a new topic.First getting into the details add what you know and take a few guesses so it doesnt turn into an interrogation produces a less superficial conversation can produce opportunities for humor either topical injokes or just comments about the absurdity of diving so far into the topic during casual conversation and can help isolate her from the group.  The idea is to turn it into a memorable conversation with just you not a vague discussion she had with a bunch of her friends and this one guy who also jumped in.  Second jumping into new topics  even if you think youre having a good conversation at the moment  is almost always a good idea.  It keeps her on her toes it keeps the conversation from getting stagnant more topics mean a greater chance at finding something she gets really excited about and each old topic can be revisited if the conversation stalls.  Obviously you dont want to throw out  random questions in the first  seconds of talking to her you dont want to come across as ADD.  The idea is to keep your ears open and mix it up semiregularly.  ,TheRedPill,d69o8lw,37,t5_2ve1u

I would wake up at  in the morning to go running. Whenever I thought about what I was getting dressed for it would make it so much harder. So instead I would do it in steps. As soon as the alarm rang next step was to sit up easy enoupgh. Once I was up it was time to put on some shorts a socks and short easy peasy. Next step was to do some light stretching nothing hard about that. Next step was to go outside and walk to the park. Next step was to start jogging into a run. Hopefully you see what Im trying to say because I cant think of any way to say it other than listing my thought process but that made things so much easier.

There were too many boomers for the WWII generation to control them. Theyre still fucking things up. The boomers raised my generation based on many flawed assumptions from the hippies. A few feminist types went after the idea of encouragement for everyone empty platitudes as motivation amd the school system followed that bullshit.  My generation took the wheel and pushed even deeper into that myth because they wrongly assumed it would work... Same with abstinence only sex ex. Doesnt work. Far too many of us Xers bubble wrapped or kids trying to shield them from reality keeping them safe because theyre so precious and helpless thinking kids are fragile or something. My generation fucked up Iraq twice the first time in  hours. So there are a few of us who can still kick ass but many are mangina losers who have wives that control their lives.

Currently Im fucking a  year old who looks late s her native American heritage is still working for her and she makes more than I do. She lives  hours away from me and that is perfect because she isnt all up in my shit all the time demanding my attention. She had earned my time and she offers herself to me for anything I wish. The Sandberg chick hell I seriously doubt she would do the same. She can enjoy her money and cats. The thing about her is she is fun wants a man with rough hands who can lead capable of handling anything and isnt a fucking wimp. She has a man fucking her who is exactly like that and since she has her own money I dont have to pay her way. That is a nice bonus since nearly every girl around here needs a man to pay for her. Id still fuck the other girls who look better provided they arent addicts dont have a plethora of kids and test me like a man should be treated not shit tested hourly as they try to milk money from me. I regularly fuck girls half my age its easy and they dont want anything more than getting fucked by a dominant wild animal held down choked told what to do as I make a playground out of their orifices.

All the drivers so accused were sent to prison with long sentences.It was later discovered by an investigative journalists that the girls stories were a pure fabrication and that all the girls belonged to a sort of gang which would hitchhike and then demand large sums of money from the driver who gave them a ride.  They would threaten the driver with going to the police with a rape story if he didnt pay up.So those who didnt pay up went to jail the girls all got off without any charges being brought against them.Fortunately when the story broke the innocent men were all released most having suffered terribly in prison some for very many years.This is why it is now so difficult to bring a charge of rape in the UK!!!  ,TheRedPill,d6zxnb0,1,t5_2ve1u

8765974,0,t1_d70ipp6,OK so some RL examples from LTRs.Yesterday my friend asked me for advice on this one so it is a fresh one. He just started a LTR relationship with a woman and several days ago he visited his children from his previous marriage. When she found out about it she first pulled the dread game on him.And then accused him of seeing his children.Her rationalization his visit was an equivalent of her seeing her exboyfriend.This is a example of woman chipping away power from man. Visiting your children is not an equivalent of visiting your ex if he admits it is an equivalent then there are two possible outcomes.. He cant see his children anymore he loses.. He can see his children but she can see her exboyfriend again he loses.Only good outcome is cases like this is to point out that those two things are not equivalent stand your ground and refuse to compromise.From RL experiences there are also compromises where man is on the losing side however he should still compromise.For instance once my LTR asked me to make a detour to pick up some of her stuff. In this situation Im on the losing side I lose like  minutes of my time. However  minutes are like... not big of a deal and she gains a lot by picking up her stuff.This is a part of functional LTR Im going to sacrifice a bit of value so she can gain something even more valuable.However it is important that she reciprocates.So there those are two examples of when to compromise and when not to compromise. Its important to analyse the costbenefit factor for yourself her and you as a couple. Its also important to figure out when she just wants freestuff and tries to trick you into compromising.Again all of this is important only for LTR.When it comes to plates you shouldnt compromise at all. Simply use the image of commitment as a carrot.,TheRedPill,d71eqs3,2,t5_2ve1u

Its really about just being a cool dude cool as in chill not uptight and keeping the pressure low so she doesnt associate you with any negative emotions only happysexual tension emotions. It subconsciously shows the woman hey this guy knows how to handle a finicky woman so he probably has lots of experience. In a way I cannot describe it subconsciously transmits a strong preselection SMV. Preselection is the most powerful form of SMV even more than looksmoneygame.The flaking thing I have down to a formula really just based on doublebooking and leaving an out. The out is being vague in a plan leaving an escape window. Eg I know a great cocktail lounge I get out of work at  I can be there . Notice the construction of the logistics..... I mentioned work so that I could use it as an excuse. If she stands me up I can just text after  mins and say Hey work is running late so I cant make it babe will make it up to you! and then do date  or just meet some buddies and hunt for more women. Other example Im going to an event with my boys after work but Ill be free after to meet at XYZ... and the reverse flake will be Hey babe Im still with my boys and I wont make it on time lets raincheck etc etc.  times out of  the woman will say Ok!!! See u next week !!Almost NO guys are good at this and typically say stuff like Im at the bar by the front or Im running  minutes late. Well he now blew his escape plan and the girl feels guilty because she knows the hapless chump is waiting all alone which ruins the guys SMV and associates his name with negative emotion.,TheRedPill,d7b7vq3,1,t5_2ve1u

Remember that finger banging is rarely fun but there are few women who cant be brought off by stimulating the clitoris dont railroad it! If you trust her enough eat pussy bonus tip ask her to shower first....more pleasant for you and they like guys who are aware that she might not feel so fresh....not talking about a first night lay of courseAnd remember her most important sex organ is between her ears not her legs.

8902735,0,t3_525e8p,gt Imagine instead a carpenter who builds houses he is driven by his greed and lust for success such that he builds these houses as quickly as possible. The carpenter spends the least amount of time possible on the design and planning just enough to get by such that the house doesnt fall down from a stiff breeze. Furthermore the carpenter is so wrapped up in his mental fantasy of riches to come that he is unfocused on what he does as he does it and HOW he builds. He is hunched over trolllike and slowly as the greed takes deeper and deeper hold in his mind his hunch progresses gradually to the point that he resembles a little goblin. After a decade of building houses he has amassed some small fortune and in doing so he has managed to ruin his health to the point where he is unable to actually build houses anymore. His health bills begin to amass greater than his fortune and his lifestyle comes to fruition and like all that is false it has moved to destroy itself. Dont be a troll. Instead be the carpenter that focuses on his form on his planning and in doing so actually ELEVATES his health such that he slowly becomes more productive and by eschewing riches for doing it the right way he is not only earning more than he ever has in the past but he has developed himself further than he ever has in the past. This carpenter has begun elevating himself from man towards the next step to that which is beyond. My friend suffering from constant injuries and chronic pain. Upon this attempt of recovery I have realized naturally this is the best way. My productivity levels have declined extremely but if I made that effort a year ago then wouldnt have been this bad. Example body weight workouts still better than no workout. I try to keep this analogy deep in my heart. Specifically my back due to herniated discs. Growth without going past limit that causes decline. It requires constant self awareness and calibration to ensure optimal conditions.Edit Pertaining to women its the same reason I didnt pick up. I found embodying TRP much more difficult but applying game naturally to all aspects of life felt like the right way. It was not cheating for the lay. I want growth not gratification.

Somehow raising kids is the worst thing that can happen.  No.  It is the single most important job.  It is the survival of the human race.  gt That its unnatural for a woman to be in the workforceI wrote this yesterdaywomen are miserable in the workforce.  That is not to say that women cant be happy doing work for compensation particularly if it is their own industrial or aesthetic art.  Sure woman can work and be happy.  And I think it is a good thing for all women over a certain age to find some sort of employmentit is healthy.The workforce is a different beast.  Chasing a career is not natural for women.  It is brutal competition that can be years and years of stress and exposure.  Nurturing and growing has no place there.That said Im not advocating throwing women out of the workforce.  They are free souls that can make their choices.  This is America after all.  I just think its a poor choice for them.,TheRedPill,d7xrnaa,7,t5_2ve1u

9161437,0,t3_55qzwx,You havent really gone into the specifics that much so I thought I might add on the following points in regards to how to get a dead certain pay rise.. Keep your resume crisp onpoint and uptodate.It is much easier to edit your resume once every  months. You should be doing this on a regular basis not once you start looking for another job. A good resume should be  pages long max. An excellent resume is  pages long uses readable fonts lots of white space google white space amp marketing relevant information amp has a nice photo of you looking smug in a suit..  Do everything you can to get promoted then fucking bail.Getting promoted internally is not an easy feat. The best way is to keep doing everything to achieve this objective and please your bosses. Casually hint that youll do a managers job at  lesser rate. When you seal the deal start job hunting with the benefits of your new title amp position..   If you are being headhunted by recruiters let the whole fucking world know.Recruiters are full of lies and bullshit. If you think HR is bad recruiters make them look like seasoned professionals who actually know their stuff. That doesnt mean you cant capitalize on this. Tell your boss your colleagues HR everyone in the fucking building. Your mum even if you want to give her false hopes that you are actually worth a shit. This does multiple things. It tells your boss that you are wanted he better buck the fuck up and give you the payrise or promotion soon. It makes your colleagues feel like a sad sack of shit that they are unwanted. Always good to make them feel like that. It builds the all important abundance mentality. If you are not getting headhunted you need to update your linkedin and get other forms of online presence that these lazy recruiters go fishing in..   Consider contract work. The ultimate fuck you money.Once you have gained some experience in your field of choice you  should consider this route as an option. I know independent contractors who make a KILLING and are treated like royalty. The fact is corporate only value whom they pay the most. Besides contract work is awesome and never stale think of management consultants independent contractors are like that but with less reasons to tie you down. It really is the big pay me upfront or I walk kind of job..   Start your own business. Why the fuck are you working for someone else? Are you fucking slave or master of your own destiny? Look once you graduate the world is literally your oyster. You shouldnt be doing what everyone else is. That is a surefire way to median and AVERAGE. Sure go work a few years in corporate world and gain the experience. But dont get sucked in and stay in that blackhole. Always have an exit strategy. Starting a side business that generates passive income is ideal and you can do anything you want in business.And look earning a shitload of money is just one part of the equation. The other and more important part is what the fuck do you intend to do with that money? If you want to live a high networth lifestyle then youd be spending alot of time making money. Its a never ending cycle. However if you just want to get out of corporate graveyard and not have your soul literally sucked the shit out of you and you stare at the mirror in  years time look at how much youve aged and grown fat.. No fuck that.. retire early and truth be told its very easy. Save  of your current income and you can retire in  years time on current spending.    ,TheRedPill,d8da2lh,10,t5_2ve1u

Personally if you got your shit together and know where you stand theres no need for you to organize. The strong will survive regardless and the weak will perish regardless. Organization is helpless against these feminist fucks because a higher percentage of men are bluepilled and support feminism inherently than the percentage that actually wishes to organize and revolt against the bullshit that is going on. Divide and conquer? It doesnt matter if the enemy is already divided by politics race and ideals.

After reading all the stuff here on TRP that shuns marriage I personally still see marriage a possibility but I acknowledge it will be difficult and risky. Does that mean I am not Red Pill? Nope Red Pill is pretty much seeing the truth and the world for how it really is Hence the reference to the Matrix. As to how we should reactchange after seeing that truth not everything is set in stone. In fact the opinions differ greatly. Shit you should see the circle jerks about MGTOW vs. Party Lifestlye at  vs Marriage vs Morality vs Dating married girlsAdultery and whatever other views pop up. Hek like your post mentions even the importance of Game is often debated upon. The Redpill is a toolbox. Use it how you like. Contribute your experiences and insights once you have them.

9297435,0,t1_d8u2fj9,gt So good looking guys still have trouble getting what they really want they have a lot easier time with the s and s who of course they mostly settle for which is one of the reasons that men who are s and s have to date down because of the amp girls hypergamy from getting attention from the amp men but not commitment which is why they always say where have the good men gone.This is why if I meet a  or  chick that is social and flirty and likes male attention I just assume her notch count is huge.  Most really promiscuous women are in this range good enough to attract an alpha for sex but nothing more.  Its amazing it takes them years to figure this out.  I suppose it has to do with the break down of the family and changes in society.  It used to be a standard trope in movies that a plain girl has a slick guy come on too strong and she falls for it and gets left abruptly.  The story plot was a type of lesson and I also imagined grandmas telling their granddaughters something similar to watch for.  Come to think of it have you seen this expressed in popular media in the last several years?  I dont think I have.  In fact we have the opposite more likely something along the lines of the movie Pretty Woman which admittedly is not about looks but still involves a huge mismatch.,TheRedPill,d8uilt5,1,t5_2ve1u

9324356,0,t1_d8xwbjh,I think the common ground we might agree on is that fucking women should primarily be hobby but no more than that. Its not a goal.When you want to partake in that particular hobby you go out you do the behaviors necessary to fuck a woman then when youre done you go back to doing shit that actually matters.Thing is fucking women is a particularly difficult hobby with a lot of ins and outs primarily because you have to convince a woman who is usually quite shitty to do something you want while thinking that its something she wants. The Red Pill and the preceding PUA ideas were born from those difficulties. Most men dont know how to be a part of this hobby. Not well anyway.But as youve noted like any hobby a lot of guys who are new to fucking women get really into it and overdo it at first then burn out and get sick of it. And they would strongly benefit from a real goal in life.Youve gone a step farther in a direction we completely disagree about and have declared that the real reason men delve into getting laid isnt even about the sex but about the supreme validation of becoming Chad the superalpha and recognized as an awesome badass throughout the universe.Admittedly becoming an awesome badass throughout the universe is a much better goal than fucking women but youre just making the tired old argument that men who are trying to get laid are really just validationseeking. My counter is that no they really really actually want to have sex and theyre just doing the behaviors necessary to get it. Whatever they choose to do after theyre done getting laid is up to them. If they enjoy living out their Chad fantasy thats great. If they go home sit in front of the TV and play video games while farting in their boxers thats fine too.,TheRedPill,d8xxiuu,3,t5_2ve1u

9327818,0,t3_57wbgb,Youre reference to the Peloponnesian War is especially salient in TRP. During the war Athens took over the alliance Delian league using alpha aggressive strategies and throwing her weight around. Athens became the first among equals and dictated what the League did making the league in effect an Athenian Empire. Sparta and its allies came together to put a stop to it and we get something akin to the Cold War except instead of capitalism vs. communism you had democracy Athens vs. oligarchy Sparta. Im rambling a bit but its an interesting subject.Unfortunately I think youre playing into too many of the myths about the Lycurgus reforms metal ingots for money... etc.. The Spartans did go Spartan as we like to call it but they also still traded and were a presence in the Peloponnese. Also its important to note that the Peloponnese was kind of like a playground when we compare the citystates to the Persian Empire or the later Roman Empire. I think your message of being open to outside forces and rising above selfsufficiency is a good strategy but do not become a big fish in a small pond.Be the Empire not the citystate.,TheRedPill,d8ydb05,2,t5_2ve1u

Born to a single mother in a college dorm room his father was absent in his life until adolescence.Forget avoiding borderline women avoid all borderline people at all costs.For a while I considered him my best friend. We came from the same metro area we both enjoyed the same hobbies and even shared vices. We reacted to physical hardship similarly.As we became closer his borderline tendencies began to show. I wont give examples but believe me when I say he exhibited  of GarbageCollectors criteria. He was a walking catastrophe and probably still is but the worst of his antics by far was the suicide attempts. It took us all by surprise at first. Then it became routine. In the four years in which Ive had the dubious honor of his acquaintance he attempted suicide no fewer than eight times. Each time he was stopped by concerned friends. Whether those attempts were genuine or merely a cry for attention only he will know though I suspect the latter.After thousands of dollars of property damage which I covered in order to prevent legal action which would have impacted me directly and years of babysitting he began to show genuine emotional progress. One night he came to me twelve shots of rum deep and made the most credible suicide threat Ive heard from him. Im so happy. Im so happy to be here. Tonights gonna be it the best day of my life. Oh yeah hot bitch coming to suck your dick?Better! Im going to take a nice hot shower. Im going to take a shower and slit my throat with my straight razor. Thank you for being such a good friend.Let him kill himself or ruin his career and potentially mine once they start investigating... Cue three infantrymen throwing him into a duty van headed for the nearest psych ward. Three weeks of investigation.

I didnt find them attractive but I gather they were pretty attractive by black standards as I havent ever seen any more attractive than they. Anyway the mildly humorous part is that one of them was apparently so interested she spent the better part of a year wearing those fake blue contacts as though she thought she could fool my piercing Aryan icegrey eyes powered by the brain situated beneath my head of lustrous Aryan goldenblonde hair.Needless to say I didnt so much as touch any one of them.

9621549,0,t1_d9xccms,At time of writing the other replies to your question seem to take the stance that depression is an ideological failing or a philosophical error that gets you into a bad head space. While this could certainly be true for some people I am but a sample size of one this was certainly not the case for me.I would go so far as to venture that thinking depression is a problem in mindset is an incredibly harmful idea for someone with my particular strain of depression.In my experience depression is entirely a chemical glitch and cannot be fixed by any amount of pondering about the nature of discipline or the virtues of stoic man. I would recommend seeking medical attention as soon as possible to acquire a suitable prescription of Fluoxetine and use the return to normal mood as your chance to improve your diet and exercise. This advice is based entirely of my successful solution and my solution alone as of such I cannot guarantee its success. For me however my depression ruined an entire year of my high school grades and totally alienated all of my friends irreparably changing my life. though it turned out to be for the better The drugs cured the depression in one week with no side effects and no addiction. This allowed me to go from couch potato who had never kicked a ball successfully to an active healthy lifestyle which holds off the depression with no drugs necessary.As you can see philosophy did nothing to help and in my case wasting time reading books just gives your life longer to fuck itself in the ass while you postpone proper treatment.It should be noted that my depression is chronic and heredity. If I stop exercising and dont restart my drugs the depression returns as strong as ever. Secondarily I got it from my dad who due to heart problems cant exercise and thus has depression pretty much all the time. I hope this control group lends credence to my advice.Now I am a New Zealander and as of such have a pretty stellar health care system. A month supply of Fluoxetine costs me  NZD. I cannot speak to international medical standards. If you are American I would not trust your doctors as far as I could throw them. Also a number of my peers report no success with their depression meds and also claim the side effects are terrible and addictive. However they are using different chemical cocktails and may just be drama queen over sensitive buttboys. God speed you son of a bitch. Hit me up if you want to chat.,TheRedPill,d9z1yaj,1,t5_2ve1u

So you have parties thrown by a group of guys where a lot of hot girls show up or a group of guys helping each other out in the game.If we arent getting married we might as well find other bachelors with similar interests as us and help each other out.,TheRedPill,da92o4f,1,t5_2ve1u
9704958,0,t1_da9676n,Agreed. Im often purposely disinterested depending on the HB level of the woman. Attractive chicks are used to getting attention when where and how they want...from who they want. So the idea that some guy has no interest in them baits them into getting your attention. Its at that point in the game that you start planting seeds to essentially get her to spread dem legs for ya. Your task then is to fuck her til shes dick drunk...Rocco style. Thatll have her coming back to YOU.Congratulations...youve added a new one to your harem.,TheRedPill,da9cehs,3,t5_2ve1u

9797617,0,t1_dakqw2v,gtI know youre trying to help but this is sounding a lot like NAWALT. The idea that there is a load of quality women out there just waiting to meet me and all Ive got to do is look in the right places to find them.Youre right that its never that simple. However its not like there isnt a significant number of single nonterrible women.gtIm skeptical about this because all women have been basically the same so far and Ive seen a wide range of them. Its easy to say youre not meeting the right women but where are you suggesting I meet them exactly? Where are all these quality women? Unless you can say where they are I fear youre just handwaving and finding a subtle way to blame me for female behaviour. ie its my fault for not having found the quality ones by looking in the wrong place. Im very wary of this advice unless you can provide a concrete actionable suggestion of where to find them.It definitely takes a lot of effort. There are probably plenty of single women who just arent looking definitely more than men. Where to find those women or how to interest those women isnt exactly something Ive figured out yet. As far as Ive heard the advice is always to look within your groups of friends and such so maybe making the right friends especially female could make it far easier to find single women. I have no clear advice though other than not treating them in an overly cynical way that is.gtRight but Im not dating men. And there is a big difference between men and women in an exclusive relationship  the man is making a much bigger sacrifice and paying a higher price to maintain the relationship than the women.Thats to make up for the relatively lower interest women have in men sexual dynamics you know. ,TheRedPill,dakrnox,1,t5_2ve1u

Fact is though they do need a modicum of interest shown in them before theyll allow themselves to be fully attracted.  Thats the case with me and my looks anyway.Thing is with you... you have New Relationship Energy with a new woman.  So you believe women are just great and relationships are just wonderful if you do them right.  Men in new relationships are always sooooooooo positive about women.  Just apply a little dread and women and relationships are awesome!.  No they arent they really arent.  Youre just enjoying the honeymoon period before the demands and the drama starts.Ive been round this loop so many times that Im sceptical and bored of the whole process.  Sex is a psychological need but beyond that I cant see the point.  Women dont offer me anything so my response is to offer them the absolute minimum I can get away with and still have sex.The thing that maximises this strategy of course is not offering any form of commitment whatsoever.  I dont even commit to going on another date with her ifuntil it happens.  This maintains attraction and drives them crazy and its actually very hard for me to do but its the only way Ive found to run things where she will put in even a tiny shred of effort.  And by tiny shred of effort I mean a text saying hey to test the waters to see if the conversation will escalate into a date.  Nothing more than that is offered no more effort than that is made.Id honestly prefer to do an awful lot more for women I see.  Id prefer to put more effort in.  Id prefer to do more commit more be there for them help them and so on.  But whenever I try that it just flips her into beta  sex denying  passive  entitled mode so I dont do it anymore.

9812624,0,t1_damg0ui,I think the majority of men are normal and tend to want similar things out of a relationship that women do  partners in life. The red pill methodology just appeals to those only seeking sex and who tend to lack empathy and dont wantrequire emotional fulfillment from relationships. But there are lots of great guys who want to get to know you and dont only want sex. There are even some who can provide great sex and emotional support. Id say not even  of men agree and follow this methodology if that. So just define what YOU want out of a relationship and be honest with yourself  thats the one thing Ive taken to heart from this sub. And dont accept less than that. Its your life and you deserve to be in whatever type of relationship you want no matter how strange narcissistic normal or however it may be defined by society.

I didnt want to get into it because there is a difference between normal hair playing which is a comforting behavior vs. grooming.  You can imagine grooming being disrespectful depending on context if you imagined she was brushing her teeth or flossing instead of combing her hair.  If she flosses before she sees you shes trying to look as sexy as possible.  If she does it while shes talking to you then clearly your opinion matters very little.

9858187,0,t1_dasie9v,Men did deny women certain liberties for partially selfish reasons and also for the greater good of society.Guess what?  Men of yesteryear denied women they were married to the ability to be alone with other men.  They were afraid that their wife would fuck said men eventually.  Well that changed and guess what?  The women were alone with men and they did indeed fuck.Without pair bonding and a reasonable certainty of paternity then men do not pair up with women and do not contribute as much to society.  Hence you are seeing the decline of the institution of marriage and the entire culture as well.Further it was once very taboo for women to dress provocatively in public.  It made them look easy and they were likely to be approached by men.   Guess what?  Women now a days dress the way prostitutes did a few decades ago.  I personally cant taken them seriously because they all look like a woman that is DTF.When women are given free reign they fuck everything up.  The main reason I believe is that they cannot think abstractly as well as men and view things outside of themselves.  Everything is processed through their emotional filters in terms of how it affects them.They are not able to contribute the same amount to society on either a physical or intellectual basis.  Therefore on what grounds aside from being nice and fair do they deserve what men have?EDIT  The argument goes that reason women contributed much less is because they were oppressed.  But it is a chickenegg thing I feel they were given less freedoms because they can do less and handle less which probably made them produce even less than they would otherwise.  For instance the more liberal countries have fewer women going into STEM fields than do countries that are comparatively regressive like the middle east.,TheRedPill,dasjmi2,5,t5_2ve1u

But he never treats the child as equal or above.An intellectual man knows by his intellectuality as intellectuality means knowledge and wisdom such debate is folly. An intellectual adult considers an insipid child as below him and thus unworthy of being a judge to his intellectuality. He doesnt even consider proving himself to the child.

9870135,0,t1_datv4sa,Yes I tried HEAVY lifting for  months when I weighed around  and then again at . Honestly... both times I felt like it was just too frustrating. When you are that fat you do not see the results as well as a dude who is skinny fat. When you go to weigh yourself your weight loss is slower then cardio especially in the early months when you are getting noob gains and putting on muscle quick. Not only that but it made me SO HUNGRY. I found myself stuffing down  calories in a meal and still hungry. This is pretty hard to control when you got work school social life and hobbies  and now you are super hungry a lot. That all being said. IN THE LONG RUN it is better for you for sure. If you are ok without seeing the scale move hardly for a month or two and are in this for the long haul you should heavy lift But if you are a scale addict and love seeing progress every week shown on the scale heavy lifting will indeed stall you for weeks or months. Getting depressed easily and losing motivation was a big issue for me back then. I am at  right now and I started heavy lifting seriously since the start of summer. Since I am low enough to see my own body finally looking more athletic I HIGHLY recommend lifting if you are just overweightchubby... obese people need to drop that body fat as quick as possible and cardio really is better for that in the short term. What I would recommend for you is a middle ground. You really do just need to get to the gym and if someone WHOS IN SHAPE wants to give you free lessons you should do it. Follow what he says word for word when you are with him. Then while you are by yourself do higher reps at a faster speed. This will be more of a cardio workout. Instead of doing sets of  do sets of  with lighter weight.This will get you exercise you need satisfy your bro and you will better off in the long run knowing how to lift properly. My own cousin actually showed me how to lift properly over the summer and theres a lot of small stuff he really helped me on that I still use constantly. I have since very much enjoyed lifting way more then I ever have and do it  times a week happily. So I say go a couple times a week with your bro then do high reps lose that fat down below  then lift heavy and enjoy your results!!,TheRedPill,dau3nvl,3,t5_2ve1u

Frequent ejaculation may ward off the potential for prostate cancer but this is best done with a partner than by yourself.Its based off more than that as you could see if youd read it again. It you need more heres two from mens health and daily mail that also jerking it helps with cystitis cancer and tenetively with diabetes. The fact is acking offs good for you and no amount of a meme or believing you get superpowers from not touching your dick is going to change that.gtDopamine is necessary for stimulating testosterone production.And sexual activity increases dopaminegtHigher serum testosterone levels are seen after  weeks of abstinence.And when no faps done long term it drops. This is ther same study that always gets bandied about for no fap but that somehow fails to understand when you stop fapping nothing goes anywhere else. It just shuts down. gtAs for immune system function I would hazard a guess this has to do with the parasympathetic nervous system and cortisol as ejaculation requires being calm but ejaculation affects neurotransmitters and hormones that are implicated in immune system function. I havent read enough into that area yet but I dont think jerking off frequently is going to make your immune system stronger because of how it affects hormones and neurotransmitters.A study in Mexico showed that serum testosterone levels in rats rose markedly after two consecutive orgasms and even further after four.  Hernandez  Additionally frequent sex improves sex hormone regulation in men and women and boosts blood vessel health.... and Frequent ejaculation reduces the risk of prostate enlargement and cancer.JSM On top of that studies have shown that in addition to those positive hormonal fluctuations cumming has positive effects on your endocrine system and causes your body to produce more adrenaline prolactin and killer cells which in turn improves immune system function.BB.com,TheRedPill,dau6ip5,1,t5_2ve1u

Start w low doses and do it w a close friend you trust who is sober or at least have a third person whos sober.Look up psychedelics and depressionmental healthptsd etc. Just google it. All sorts of studies are coming out on the effectiveness. Put it this way its like reintroducing color into your world metaphorically speaking. Youll realize youve been walking around in black and white. Depression tends to just grey things out and it can build very slowly over years. Psychedelics remind you of what vitality feels like. So the trick is to use them to help you clear the fog and remember what a clear and vital mentality is. Then after the comedown theres not a hangover but rather an afterglow. This is where you write down your insights and make a plan for integrating them into your life. Then after youve integrated  months later or so you take psychs again and level up again.You cant walk around high all the time obviously.

9957181,0,t1_db4ltc5,Bullshit.You dont need success to have an abundance mentality. Thats the whole point  adopting the mentality intentionally when you dont believe you already have abundance.The key to changing your mindset about abundance is to compare your state of living in the modern world to the life a human  years ago would have lived. Or hell if you have a hard time imagining that imagine yourself to be a poor starving child in the deserts of Africa. Quickly you will realize that you already have abundance coming out of your ass. Everything you could ever want or need in life is available to you and its simple to acquire. All the material needs you have can be met with very little effort and you never need to worry about starving. Not like that poor African child.Quickly you will come to realize that your anxieties are prisons you create for your mind not real things. Your incessant striving for something greater which you will never find is because you have failed to appreciate what you already have.Adopting the same mentality with women is just as easy.

9972797,0,t3_5idhp8,Here are some factors that make cohabiting so difficult today Couples dont have children who would take the womans attention and make her appreciate the man more. Communities have disintegrated by modern life which means most women dont have a group of friends in stable relationships with whom she could unload so she needs to take it out on her man. Modern women are too dumb to understand they also need some alone time and ask for it so she will act like a bitch to her man instead not even understanding herself why. Modern comfort and living standard means men dont have much to do outside work besides lounging in the house. Doing hobby things that are not needed will be interrupted by the woman. Pubs have become venues for hooking up and for alcoholics instead of places for men of the community to socialize. Property rights for women and madeup jobs for women means they own half of the place or pay half of rent. This lowers her respect for the man. Women despise a man who spends much more time with them than for sex. Keeping her missing you by working onoff schedules is more difficult because  since no community exists anymore she will cheat on you without anybody finding out.So what can you do if you want to cohabitate with a woman or are already doing it? Start ridiculous bullshit drama before she does so she can have something to be emotional about. Go visit friends for drinking and gambling in the nights. More difficult today since many jobs require you to be sober and many people have driving commutes. Get a job that is a week onoff or even a month onoff. Difficult because the lack of community means she can cheat on you without you knowing. Then again depending on job you increase your own opportunities to chase women. Build a man cave or work on another hobby like millions of other losers who cant even be in their own house because of their woman.Solid post OP but you could go easier on the Drill Sergeant Hardass writing style too many contributors here use it already its getting tiresome and it hinders your message.,TheRedPill,db7hdsm,25,t5_2ve1u

Any attractive man that has ever had work with women knows what Im talking about . Ill give you an example at my job Im a server at an Italian restaurant. Anybody that works in the restaurant biz knows your surrounded by women. Well one of my coworkers was having trouble slicing lemons. I poked fun at her by asking if she never cut a lemon before. She proceeded to tell my to suck her dick. I responded with you dont have one. She then retorted with Then Ill just have to suck yours with that devilish grin women get when they want to fuck the shit out of you.  I didnt think anything about it until moments later. If I as a man said to her that I wanted to stick my tongue down her pussy I would have been fired on the spot. I started to analyze all the interactions Ive had with women. I realized in many cases they were sexually harassing me well at least if I were a women it would be harassment.  If you are attractive its almost like a daily occurrence. I would never consider any of these things harassment because I never saw it as that but through the feminist female lens it was. Will I report it? No because Im not a pussy and Im definitely going to take her on her proposal. Sexual harassment is just another way of handing women the power of who they should come in contact with at the workplace.

What about the fact that for the majority of Americans for the majority of the past  years you went to work for the town factory. Thats a monopsonist if Ive ever seen one. The labor market is extremely competitive at the highskilled end of things. But for lowskilled workers there are increasingly fewer buyers every year and the vast majority of those buyers are nationalglobal corporations. gtit would be absolutely idiotic to try and fix that with minimum wages which wont have a net positive benefitVery smart and very well respected economists disagree with you on that point. Until you are out publishing in the JAE Im going to treat your opinion as the trash that it is.gtdirectly address the problem by massively reducing the regulatory hurdle to new business formation.New business formation isnt going to solve the power imbalance between national corporations and lowskilled workers. Even if they got rid of all the tailored unionkilling laws at this point the damage is done. The minimum wage is the least worst option for preventing widespread abuse.

10056220,0,t1_dbhrna3,Have a work wife HB  who I am decent friends with. I work with her department often so we have to communicate all the time but I enjoy her company. Not that attracted to her but she serves well as good natural dread for current LTR and I can tell she wants to fuck my brains out. She recently went on a break with her boyfriend and admitted to me that if we werent co workers we would have already slept with each other. I get a front seat to see AWALT in action as well as see the hamster turn often as shes slept with one coworker and flirted her way with another. I call her out on BS all the time and she likes it since no one else in the office calls her out for anything. She tells me details of whats going on between her and her ex as well as they go from saying they cant be together right now how she wants to settle down with him one day in the future and just how BPcucked her ex is.Its like having a nice daily reminder that the hamster turns to justify anything how women would rather ride the CC prewall and settle for the betas they trap later for security reasons postwall and the basic principle of AFBB. I think male to female friendships work very well when you hold the power dynamic in your hands vs the other way around. Men can have the power to flirt be a friend and escalate to a critical point while not ending the night inside her while women are ruled by emotion and will sleep with a man if the man was just willing to do so.TBH female friends are great so long as they arent a part of the inner circle you keep.

They are going thru the anger phase and come from a place of abject scarcity mentality and the constant blowback of living with a low SMV. This means the are angry at women and this is hamstered into spite towards them. Suddenly women are only good for pumping and dumping. As the red pill man matures and rises in SMV the anger and All the other BS disappeare. In the end many red pill men transition into LTRs because its generally quite nice even though it does entail many pitfalls. Shit I love sitting on the couch watching series with my wife. Especially if Ive just shoot a load onto her. Its nice. Shes a good cook and a great fuck. I love her.

Glyphosate will only decompose at the level of fire...  above Farenheit  degrees.ampnbsp What does it do?ampnbspWell it sterilizes your gut bacteria killing off healthy organisms that have taken thousands of years to adapt to your human internal ecosystem.The net effect is the weak tired skinny fat body.Your intenstines become inflamed by invasive bacterias that adapted to the Glyphosate but your immune system sees this new invader as a problem and activates an immune response.  For some this is severe and it gets classified as Crohns Disease but thats just because they dont want to call it Glyphosate Poisoning which would alert Monsanto to have to spew out more fake propaganda to cover up their crimes.ampnbsp The answer?ampnbspYou will get hit by Glyphosate...  no avoiding it entirely.But you can reduce exposure by avoiding soy corn and wheat products.  Hard to do?Yes.  You need to steer towards organic  foods to reduce the poisons.ampnbsp ProBiotics and IodineampnbspIodine seems to do a decent job of knocking down the invasive bacterias. they hate it  Get something like Iodine tablets from Sea Kelp. the Japanese eat a lot of Sea KelpA good ProBiotic will have  or more strains of good bacteria to restock your gut and get it growing back to a healthy condition.ampnbsp Long term effectampnbspYou will feel better and your gains in working out will be better.Glyphosate effectively starves your intenstines and means you consume foods but dont get much nutrition from them.

The government is in place in part to enforce the law. Knowing the massive fuckup they did last year means they should do everything in their power to prevent this from happening again and they seem to have done a great job this year by protecting the citizens. Saying to people not to go somewhere because the government refuses to provide protection is in my view saying its your own fault for then getting harassed if you are female and go to these places.Sticking your hand in a fire and then getting burned is a very different situation as it involves no other people and just the laws of nature.

Typically a warmup set followed by four sets of increasing weight.

10272382,0,t3_5myhdy,Im just gonna post something that one of my friends wrote on Facebook. Gives a different opinion on the whole issue.This video has been going around so let me get some things straightTLDR  This is a well dressed pile of bs.  There is no evidence that millennials are less productive happy or satisfied with their professional life and if its true its probably more related to a development in existential thinking about the purpose of work since a smaller percentage of the workforce belongs to life sustaining production. Also Suicide and unhappiness are not necessarily related. the dopamine pathway is one of the fundamental drivers of our pleasure and motivation. Literally everything from eating to taking a nice poop involves dopamine so suggesting that social media is bad because it feels good is a huge and useless leap. theres nothing that suggests that people are more or less beholden to social cues and pressure its just that this takes place online more. Sure we dont know the implications but Im tired of this doomsday bullshit. Zero connection between the premise of how millennials function in the workplace and social media.The guy made some important mostly obvious points about how too much of anything is harmful. There is a great deal of importance to facetoface interaction. But on the other side plenty of friendships that would otherwise disintegrate exist only because of the internet. Technology is changing how we interact for better and for worse but lets chill with the our brains our melting shit and the smug white guys that get paid to muse about an untested age group that just dipped into adulthood.Edit grammar,TheRedPill,dc8fiki,3,t5_2ve1u

I would argue that this is the case because the hood is the blacks default culture or at least the general perception of the black default culture is hood this bleeds over to areas outside the USA by the way  due to Eagleland Osmosis the idea nonAmericans have of US blacks also tends to reflect this image. Whites on the other hand dont really have such a default culture and if they do its mostly reflected by the opinions of those whites who are in charge in culture politics economics the media....

10362759,0,t1_dchc6l1,Just an expansion on the point made below.  I think many posters are alone annoyed with the cut and paste boiler plate responses over and over again with masculine feminine polarity and often times at semi offtopic times.But more recently he seems to be pivoting to really hammer home on the family alpha concept.He is very much skirting the line IMO and fluffing the blue pill users on here calling themselves red pill.  I was a HUUUGE offender of this and at the time I could not understand when I saw TRP clamp down on these posts but they get a lot of attention.Why?  Because purple pill posts ignite the hope that blue pill users hold onto that they can make their blue pill ideals a reality with the red pill.Hey I really dont have to worry about plates because I can just boot up the Family Alpha program . and then I can live happily ever after.  This is the worst kind of false hope and idealism.It is served to the users in a way where they get to indulge their hamster at the highest level.Is he outright saying this?  No.  Hes saying things that are technically possible and skirting what I think most can agree are core TRP tenants.  That relationships have an expiration date that date is more or less when the womans body stops pumping out dopamine in a males company. This process is more or less irreversible.  It is manageable but she will never get the same pump she got from you.  And all attempts to change that are likely feeble or as Rollo points out better suited investments in the self or to find a new relationship. TRP vets are up to task with both the lightswitch effect and rewriting history SMV is external and not always entirely rationalThere in my opinion should never be a badged user on TRP who is doing anything but the hard work of informing blue pill users of how it is and why theyre still not getting it.TRPs design its system is from an engineering standpoint solid.  It is supported by a lot of anecdotal evidence that is easy to figure out when youve had a couple of serious LTRs.  But lots of the guys on here do not and will not have that experience to realize just how large the forces are that youre up against.  And you dont want to be fully swallowing finally after your first divorce with kids.To be talking about as he puts it lifelong or lifetime attraction goes against studies that essentially hardcap that around  months.  This is where it gets weasel wordy.  If you held frame for  years straight and never slipped up once your relationship in terms of attraction would still be on fumes.Another user put it best once shes seen a shit stain in your underwear its over and if I have to explain to you why its not about the shit stain youll never get it.The systemic pedestalization of women has made an LTR with kids a setup not where you wonder if it will fail but judge the degree of failure.Blue pill users cling on desperately with all of their might to the notion that they can simplySMVgtSMV  Hold frame      This  page algorithm called the purple pill formula neglects a couple immutable facts.  All it takes is one Chad to destroy everything and women are logical but irrational.  That being Alpha Bucks does not mean she wouldnt fuck a heroin dealer given the chance then blame it all on you and take the cash and prizes golden parachute.If youre TRP you dont go into marriage with anything other than an expectation of failure.  But these posts inspire hope in those that need the wakeup call the most.They need to understand truly underneath it all there is NO none zero lifelong attraction.  That is chemically impossible.  There are lots of women from an absolute standpoint who running just on oxytocin will remain in a relationship for family for money BB or validation BB etc etc.  That is not attraction.  Relationships have an expiration point period.Relationships have expiration dates and being proltr with this user base is really being covert promarriage.I get it guys want families. We all do.  But the message has to be realistic.  That you need to be going in with the expectation of down the road managing some degree of relationship failure.  That we are simply not built that way.And these guys that are talking about SMV disparity and red flags vetting etc.  They are clinging on to that last bit of hope desperate that they can game the system to support the blue pill dream.That to me is the largest failure of the red pill.  Not systemically radically day in and day out dropping the hammer on that hope.  Because that hope is the hardest hurdle to overcome but the reasoning is there.She is built to move to greater pastures even if they are to him objectively worse.  And her mind will do whatever necessary to make that feeling a reality.Everything else is blue pill fantasy.So no Im not just attention whoring.,TheRedPill,dciohs6,5,t5_2ve1u

Im going to quit wasting my time after this but in case it is of use to somebody Ive been that hardworking super driven guy all my life. I have a masters degree Ive made a lot of money and now I run my own IT business. The red pill coupled with my own life experience made me realize that none of that really matters very much to women. Certainly didnt get me anywhere. And to the guys that say pussy doesnt matter...you need to get your T levels checked.Money and success as conventionally defined dont get women horny. Confidence entitlement and social proof do. Having a low paying job isnt sexy but neither is having a high paying job. I know guys that make a lot of money who intentionally dont show it to women because it gets them put in the provider box. Obviously having more money is better than having less money but you dont get something for nothing and that bigger paycheck is going to come at a cost. The best PUA I ever met got that way because his parents paid all his bills and he focused on nothing but game for several years. In my experience freedom is far more valuable than money as long as your basic needs are met. To quote Fight Club You are not your job. You are not how much money you have in the bank. I took me a long time to learn this lesson. To me its just astounding that guys will spend  hours a week working in some shitty office management job and have no time or energy to do anything else just so that maybe in  years they can be promoted to a higher paying shitty office management job. If thats a purpose count me out. That same guy could be teaching surfing lessons in Costa Rica part time living on minimal income and becoming a musician on the side. While getting tons of quality pussy of course. Thats what the red pill is about. Go read the sidebar again. I dont know how you guys manage to get it so ass backward. Having discipline and hard work so you can be a good little cubicle drone so that maybe one day youll get rewarded with a used up thirty year old wife who has been getting fucked by losers for the last ten years is exactly the opposite of red pill. Maybe youve spent a lot of time and effort to get where you are in your career. So have I. Get over it. Its a sunk cost.

I had a conversation with an unemployed marxist photographer just the other day we were talking about the job market for the arts and so I brought up things like Instagram Prisma and digitalization to show her how photography is actually one of the hottest assets around. Of couse she says its all commercial she shows me pictures she has done. All bad a  year old could do a technically better job with lighting exposure etc. So the conversation turns to objective quality in art. And no fucking shit she shows me a swedish arab artist who has collected random pubic hair in filing cabinet as an art project and a bunch of other stupid shit.  Eventually I say well then if everything is subjective is pedophilia then also just an art if you say so? Ding ding ding turns out there are allready several artists who have done art projects where pedophilia is committed. If you look at Lars Vilks while i support his freedom of Speech and like that he challenges Islam and other hardcore lunatics his art is also just a bunch of gay dudes fucking eachother in a depraved way and then calling it art.

They dont have the same motivation to hurt you and often want to just get from point A back to the hive with their pollen and not get squashed.  Therefore they are easily batted away and are typically not aggressive unless you step right into a hive of them.  Wasps and hornets can sting over and over again.  And they are aggressive and will come after you if you piss them off often joining forces together with several of them in order to bring down their prey.  You ever want to see something nasty watch a swarm of hornets bring down a small animal  and then leave it for dead.

Actually women fuck men with muscles over skinny fatauschwitz ab fucks all the damn time  but people like yourself look at the ole brad pitt fightclub physique and say well women prefer that over this guyinsert popular bodybuilder here. But its not because they like the physique more its because they attach the SMV of Brad Pitt to that physique. Your body only plays a part in your overall SMV its doesnt make up the bulk of it you can even be so high in some parts that make up your SMV that others dont really matter. Look at rich old men with young gold digging hotties. If youre already struggling dating women dont hamster yourself into thinking you can skip out on going to the gym and have a mediocre physique you need to use every avenue possible to raise your SMV and one of the easiest way to do so is getting jacked.

Congratulations youre going to be sucking your bosss dick for as long as he wants to keep you around.  You NEED that job to maintain your lifestyle and if you are laid off youll be in foreclosure city and your wife will probably leave you.  Note that this situation can happen for someone at almost any salary level  look at Johnny Depp and his  millionmonth lifestyleNow lets say you stayed at a small but classy flat near your job and decided that you could walk or take public transit to work.  You also maxed out your pretax retirement contributions and saved  of your income.  A few years later youve built up a huge fuckyou fund.Lets say at this point youre laid off or even better you actually do say Fuck you! to your boss and walk out.  Thanks to the asset base that youve built up you now have a runway from which you can launch.  Launch what?  Anything you want.  Depending on how many monthsyears of runway you have you can find a new job in another country switch career tracks go back to school write a book start a band set up a yoga studio or finally expand that sidegig youve been working on into a full business which is what Id recommend.Heres the best part if youre expenses are less than  of your savingsinvestments then your runway is basically infinite.  Congratulations youve achieved financial independence and you never have to take a job that you dont enjoy ever again.

Neither approach is wrong. It is about the net value you create not who receive that value.Now you touch on an important point in your second last paragraph. What you are describing is essentially one of the key differences between two ancient philosophies Stoicism and Zen Buddhism. StoicismBeing a social animal and contributing to the world in some way or the other. A Stoic person would do as OP did and like you would do. It doesnt matter that the work is lost eventually or that people eventually forget you consider your relationships as work in this case. As long as you did whatever was in your power to make the work as worthwhile as possible for the society as a whole you did your duty as a virtuous man.  Zen BuddhismEmbracing the current moment and nothing else. The buddhist would likely meditate and come to some sort of realization. The realization could lead to laughter or to making a few phone calls like the stoic would. He does not feel obliged to contribute to society because society is ultimately an illusion but he may choose to contribute anyway because that is in his nature.   ,TheRedPill,ddd5puo,1,t5_2ve1u

My Tinder game is pretty good now. Its fairly concise and naturally filters out the time hos . Initial text about how its a match and we should get to know each other before racing off to Vegas together. This sets up a togetherness vibe of uswe doing stuff in an imagined way. This already has us off on the right foot and creates an imaginary commonality something she can imaginefantasize about.. They respond or they dont. Do NOT get butthurt if they dont reply. You have no idea how many accounts are inactive bots and generally fake.. Light banter followed by me stating how the app kills my battery and I give them my number and to text me. Those who text me are game and already hooked so I dont need to do a song and dance to get them to meet up. Those who dont text just disqualified themselves as time hos.. A couple texts exchanged setting up logistics. This one is optional but if the pics look too good to be true then youll want to get a picture from her that avoids being catfishedAll that being said younger women are harder to pull. Women  are the easiest but I dont prefer them so for me its a crapshoot. Id say about half of the younger women  who do match with me are wannabe sugar babies. Only they never actually want to do the things sugar babies are supposed to do lowgrade escorts. The other half are spammersscams. Maybe once in a blue moon are they legit daddy issues and wants to date someone with a big age gap.Something else Ill add is that I lack any real escalation or edginess which is something Im working on. I need to figure out a way of giving it a sexual subtextundertone so when we meet theres already a sexual tension. Escalating in person isnt so much an issue but Id like to be able to hit the ground running.

10704493,0,t3_5szrjj,Youre wrong on the first part.For the rest I believe it is simply the beginning of transcendance.You have some misunderstanding of money. Sure money can buy almost everything but Ill just go brief with this exempleGive everyone on earth a million dollars what happens?Well now most people are way more poor than before nobody wants that million anymore theyll want more and those who had saved a bit to the low quarter of people who are millionaires are not fortunate anymore. Thats what brings me to the rest. These people doesnt own more theyve lost something they dont have infinite money. But even if they did that doesnt mean they own everything because money is a tool like a hammer. Give a hammer  a man hell build stuff. Give him more hammer he may start to trade them. Give him infinite hammer... well he could hold all those hammers so people would crave for these but he could have gave everyone a hammer so nobody wants some anymore so hammers is worth nothing anymore. But in reality anyone is kinda free to make his own hammer in some case those whove got infinite hammer are just exceptionally good at getting these.Check out Warren Buffet he used to buy two different shoes at the thrift shop to have a better price on them. He is not some sort of crazy weirdo who wants to see chaos on earth he did what he wanted to do buy stuff sell them higher make business run he is the game changer because thats what hes good at.Bear in mind that everyone cant be alpha. And I think some equal stuff happening is the result of too much beta around who just want to pull down successful people as they are kinda right to do so they are betas they also want a taste of success. Everyone wants to matter but we are so many.,TheRedPill,ddk37j0,1,t5_2ve1u

10718201,0,t1_ddleq7t,Ah  gotcha.Well I think its just how were defining terms here. Roark was completely focused on his work and didnt seek female companionship outside of Dominique but he was unquestionably alpha in that relationship  she offered herself up as a slave to him but he refused to rescue her or even order her around outside of sex until she eventually stopped being a little bitch and whining about the world. So while Roark didnt go around maximizing his bed usage he eventually got everything he wanted and got it on his own terms. Thats pretty RP.Meanwhile Wynand was to all appearances completely RP  he was the unquestioned alpha in command of anything he choose to take command of including women. But his main drive was for power over the masses who he had nearly complete disdain for  and at the end he realized that all his power over hordes of betas was worthless as they added nothing to anything he actually valued in life.It really kinda depends on how you want to view your RP goals if its about selfactualization achievement and inalienable selfworth then Roarks your guy. Hes the one who demands uncompromising excellence of himself and takes the world and redefines it around his vision. If to you RP means money social dominance and women then Wynands who you want to be. But hes also the one who ignores everything he actually wants and dedicates his energy and ability to serving up piles of mediocrity in exchange for money and the illusion of power  but once he tries to use that power for what he actually wants it dissolves completely. He realizes that they were not his servants he was theirs.And in the end Roark cucks Wynand.In retrospect its really quite an exploration on many RP principles.,TheRedPill,ddli48i,2,t5_2ve1u

10814776,0,t1_ddvbagv,Read the sidebar. All of your questions are answered in great depth. Anyways the problem is you are still wanting the easy answer. The problem there is an easy answer doesnt exist. You wanted to come here ask your question and get some magic advice that fixes everything. It simply doesnt work like that. Are you lifting? You didnt mention that you are. If you arent thats step one. Go on a strength training linear progression program. Youre wrong that plutonic friendships exist between genders. Generally one of the people involved wants more than a friendship. You even contradicted yourself on that topic. You say plutonic friendships like that exist but whenever you get to that point with a woman you end up with feelings. You are friendzoning yourself and then wondering why you are in the friendzone. Its because these women arent seeing you as a sexual being but rather a simple source to use for validation when Chad isnt around. They dont see you as a sexual being because you arent doing anything to make them see you that way. Action in this case lifting and dressing nice equals reaction having more women want to sleep with you. If you are out of shape and fat and not willing to do anything to fix it you might as well just get use to a lifetime absent of sex and attraction from women. At least until you turn  and can be some whores beta provider. Ask yourself this question. What am I doing to make these women notice and like me? If it is nothing theres the answer. You are putting the horse in front of the carriage so to speak. Worry about you first make money get in shape dress nice and be social. After you do that it just comes with the territory. Youre either out of shape suck at being social with people are so thirsty women find it creepy or dress like shit. If you do those things women notice. Seriously ask yourself that question.

However what makes you a man is your steadfastness your view on the world. We can teach you the ropes but how you climb them is up to you. Yes sometimes women can be annoying can catch you offguard. This happens. I dont overthink it. If she acts against my principles I will say something  stoically. If it happens again. I will hand out consequences beta or not. A pimp is never considered beta if he is nice childishly angry or aggressive when he has a strong hand on his hoes and enemies and keeps problems at bay. Imagine Chad in a relationship. Jane is giving him the silent treatment. Chad will ask her once maybe twice whats wrong  that is perhaps considered beta by some.

Theyve killed the needy little slug inside and girls can still feel that they are outcome dependent.Biggest regret this last weekend occurred while I was going out with a group of attractive female friends and my bro. I hadnt been out in a while but had no difficulty at all generating selfamusement laughing teasing my friends and getting strong IOIs from strange femmes in the crowd.  The regret is I didnt do anything about it.  One of the girls in the group started coming on to me so that was like table scraps but there was one fine femme in the crowd that stopped in her tracks and pushed her friend out of the way to ogle me... I just smiled while walking through and played it safe like a bitch. Another late s postwall hb stopped me square and put her hands on me and tried to get me to acquiesce to some sort of joke...I couldnt understand her so I made some humorous rebut as I smoothly turned her and walked away I should have bantered with her for a bit since I wasnt talking to people outside of my friend group.

That is exactly why there are so many Indian guys who are out of shape. They blame it on the bad genes whereas the reality is bad diet and no exercise. To top that most of them buy cheap clothes and do not clean up well. OP is right on about ear and nose hair. I know this because I was that loser until I was . I lost weight started working out and Running. Bought nice clothes and started getting haircuts regularly from an Italian hairstylist since I live in Europe. I could feel the difference in the way people interacted with me before and after my weight loss. I could also notice the difference in my attitude after the weight loss. I definitely recommend following things to fellow Indians who really want to improve their lifestyle Get in shape  Good workout plan   Good diet  Have a good hobby Running Dancing Hiking Horse Riding etc. other than watching movies TV series and playing video games.

11071931,0,t1_demzivj,A caloric deficit on low carb will result in Much faster weight loss because of a chronically low insulin level and therefore high HGH and glucagon level allowing free release of free fatty acids from lipase tissue. Also the longer a person goes without carbohydrates the more efficient they become at burning fat. So when on a calorie deficit while eating carbs your body is always switching between fuel sources and never adapts leaving you craving carbs and feeling shit when you dont eat. However a calorie deficit on LOW carb HIGH fat means your body gets better and better at making ketones and releasing fatty acids becoming fat adapted so you still feel great in between meals even though you are in a deficit burning the same fuel source. Not eating carbs keeps blood sugars stable so is is a very good way for easy goodfeeling weight loss. ,TheRedPill,demzrfc,23,t5_2ve1u

Its all about context. Had you lived a nondegenerate traditional life youd want to follow the patriarchal order. There is no original thought... Its all learned adaptations. But the thing is the patriarchal system where men are incharge is sustainable and efficient. Your woman isnt your friend shes your woman. She shouldnt be boring you because you should be busy working on projects or not getting bored because your male friends are there to entertain you.You got bored of her because you expected too much of her and that is your weakness as a man that you expected so much out of a woman. That negativity was a result of your own lack of self grounding and failing to be the masculine polarity in the relationship. Tell me... Do you have friends? If you do invite them over sometime. The traditional minded woman would be happy to cook for you and your friends and serve drinks. You are now entertained.The day seems banal? Well make it so that its not banal.

Being a skeptic is the basis for success.You build your belief system on layers  much like Euclidian geometry builds on certain basic truths and expands logically. This is much like the scientific method.TRP is the scientific method applied to life.Start with Physical facts based on experience. You observe gravity and physical laws. Then you adjust to take advantage of them by aligning them with your goals. Example You WANT to fly but you live within the framework of observations.Then you look at yourself and your abilities. Recognize your shortcomings and then address them. You want to bench  lbs but you cannot. So you put in place a diet and workout regimen that you have seen work for others and start lifting.Then you look at behaviors of people around you.  Observation is key to understanding. Theory even TRP is useless unless backed up by observation which is why people call out AWALT in field reports it validates the theory. And then once you understand the rules of the game you can align your actions within the observed rules to maximize your benefit regardless of your goal. Date women? Be successful in the work place?

Been losing a pound a week steadily. However I get an allotment for each day to eat. I get to keep anything I dont spend.So far Ive gone to vitamin shoppe locally and purchased a case of Isopure protein drinks g F g C g P to keep protein up. Aiming for a gram of protein per body weight. bought a  dollar crock pot at Walmart to make hard boiled eggs and chicken each evening in the room. go on  minute elliptical runs at  am and more running and lifting hotel has dumbells up to  lbs in the evening. typically get some grilled chicken nuggets from chikfila for quick protein for dinner. Lunch is kind of a stickler because the only thing within  miles is a Wendys. There I just get a garden salad and a grilled chicken sandwich.I do all this because I also have coworkers who want to go out and get dinner together. As is expected most of them eat like shit. And since Im a small dude thats overweight I need a calorie intake of like  calories. Ill order something off the value menu and will drink water or the shittiest lightest beer they got available.Granted I work about  hours a day currently but anything else I can do to cut on the road?

The issue whether fair or not is that women have to take time off to start and have families. For unknown reasons no one likes to acknowledge averages. On average women work fewer hours than men. This is because the burden of children and families fall on them. There are plenty of females who work more than men and get paid more and plenty of men who work less and get paid less. No one wants to acknowledge the huge middle of the bell curve but only the extremes. At the end of the day pay is about productivity and what you can bring to the company not about gender.

She might not cheat or dump you for the first dick but even if she doesnt the fact that another dick came along will make her feel trapped. Shell start resenting you treating you like shit dry up the sex and blow up your relationship. When a woman needs space and feels trapped what she really wants to feel isnt freedom. She wants to feel available for the next man.When youre an attractive man whos spinning her rather than the other way around she isnt motivated to keep you by love. Shes motivated by fear.

My MBA wife hadnt worked in  years so they calcd her potential income to be  and I was making well into the six figures. From judges view point its my choice not to go out and make all that money again. So my salary minus her  divide by two and thats what I had to come up with  out of my assets. Weird.

11363965,0,t1_dfk13wu,gtClassic male shaming.  Interest in sex and maintaining freedom is redefined as childish because it doesnt suit what women want from men.  Were not going to change just because you disapprove.Obsession with sex at the expense of other things is addiction. Addiction isnt about what you do its about what you give up. Classic TRP nonsense you are not interested in sex you are obsessed with it. You are not maintaining freedom you just dont want to get married. Im fine with you not wanting to get married. Thats your choice. Your obsession with the context of marriage and how it plays out in society is completely ridiculous and it narrows your world view. All the things youve given up to join this group are what bothers me. Ironically its exactly the things youre looking for. Independence self respect and truth. Monogamy has been a part of human life since the beginning. Marriage is not monogamy. Marriage is a legal contract. Monogamy is totally different. Once again for the tenth time Im still not clear if your against marriage or monogamy. Im beginning to think you dont understand the difference. Please enlighten me.gtThe difference in motivations is massive and it cant be made insignificant just because you say so.The girls in my life have exactly the same motivations as I do. Successful fulfilling career fulfilling hobbies fulfilling relationships. If your motivations are fuck everything until I die than yeah women tend to have different motivations but so do the vast majority of us men. Your conflating normal motivations with female specific motivation. gtIn fact a lot of your points are men are completely obsessed with sex and easily controlled by women which is rather at odds with your view that the differences in motivation are insignificant.Foolish men and young men ill equipped to deal with their libido are obsessed with sex. Most of us grow up. gtDenying your own nature is not being an adultYeah it pretty much is. Not denying thats unhealthy but controlling it harnessing it and redirecting it to productive things. Same with being a parent. Its about putting off things you just kinda want for things for things your going to really need and prioritizing problems. Its in most peoples nature to blow their lottery winnings. Surely youd concede they should have controlled themselves instead.gtIgnoring the hypocrisy behind you blame others which is blaming others yourself....Im not blaming you for my problems that would be hypocrisy. Im blaming you for your problems. Which is perfectly consistent.gtSo whats your story.... whats your alternative?  Opting out of women or settling into a mostlysexless longterm relationship?Its quite sex filled actually  years strong and still fucking  or  nights a week. I really dont want any more than that thats plenty. gtI think youve made a choice and you think others should make the same choice to justify yours.  You have settled into a tedious rut and you are upset that others have not done the same thing.Im upset that your going to pay a steep price for this later in your life. And that Ill have to volunteer and help pay for young people to hang out with you when youre old because no one else will. I hope you have a strong group of friends who also choose not to get married because despite your close minded misogyny and tragic lack of self reflection youre a human being who feels pain and sadness like everyone else and I dont think you deserve to be shunned and ignored no matter how much everyone agrees youre insufferable and did it to yourself.  ,TheRedPill,dfk3110,1,t5_2ve1u

They go full on oneitis and worship the girl. They do anything for her. She cheats on him. He forgives her. She does it again. He forgives her. She cucks him. He accepts it. He will do anything for her he wants to chase that feeling of love chemical release and she gives him that like no one else. But everyday hes dying. Hes growing weaker. He feels he cant live without her. But to her hes pathetic. He grows unhappier the more time that passes on. If only shed just return the affection he has for her.

Their movementsideologies have grown by controlling a narrative  vilifying one side Muslims are all Terrorists Men are all sexist whites are all racist while sanctifying the opposite view while inoculating it from criticism Jews are Gods chosen people and hence racially and spiritually superior Women are powerful  yet victims etc to the point that one dares not even question these things.Look at Rachel Dolezal or Bruce Jenner for just two perfect example of how controlling the narrative can lead to the emperors new clothes. THAT is how powerful narrative control can be and they know this.They also know that if you let a seemingly innocuous opposing narrative fester because ha ha look at those little weak fools over there it can grow to become an uncontrollable and dangerous mess like they themselves have become. So any slight insult like wolf whistling or cat calling MUST be immediately and harshly slapped down and widely vilified. Gamergate is yet another example.  It gets people to back off and think twice about questioning even more serious issues like false rape allegations or genocide.So rape culture is yet another facet of the feminist control over narrative.  The more we argue about rape culture the less we spend time paying attention to our elected leaders. Entertainment in all its forms is an opiate of the masses  just like religion. This folks is entertainment. ,TheRedPill,dg0013y,3,t5_2ve1u

While men on average still earn more than women the gap between them has narrowed considerably particularly among more recent entrants to the labor force.For all Americans it has become much harder to make a living without a college degree for intertwined reasons including foreign competition advancements in technology and the decline of unions. Over the same period the earnings of college graduates have increased. Women have responded exactly as economists would have predicted by going to college in record numbers. Men mysteriously have not.Among people who were  years old in  for example women were  percent more likely to have attended college and  percent more likely to hold an undergraduate degree.I think the greatest most astonishing fact that I am aware of in social science right now is that women have been able to hear the labor market screaming out You need more education and have been able to respond to that and men have not said Michael Greenstone an M.I.T. economics professor who was not involved in Professor Autors work. And its very very scary for economists because people should be responding to price signals. And men are not. Its a fact in need of an explanation.Most economists agree that men have suffered disproportionately from economic changes like the decline of manufacturing.

A relationship involves two people and doesnt always fall apart when one or both party does something unacceptable to the other but often its what people dont do thats causing the problems like talking openly about your feelings and issues and finding ways to resolve these. It doesnt sound like you did this at all. It sounds like you are treating her badly to punish her for what she supposedly did to you. I do not think thats the right way to treat a loved one and its unproductive too. Why not just break up with her? Sounds like shell be better off without you and this behaviour.Flirting with stripperswaitresses at a strip club? They likely have  interest in you and just want your money so dont take these experiences as any sort of info on how well youll do with women whom you dont have to pay for their timeattention.It sounds like you are too wrapped up in calling certain behaviours alpha or beta and that only alpha behaviour is the way to go. I think thats a mistake.I dont think you should lie to your partner about where you are and what you are doing. If you think she wont approve maybe talk to her about it. Find out why you feel the need to go to strip clubs ask her ifwhy she has a problem with it and take it from there. Would you be happy if she goes to see male strippers?It sounds like shes looking for a committed relationship and looking to marry soon perhaps start a family. It sounds like you are not at all looking for this as you come across as selfish and unsure about what you want. Its not uncommon for people who start dating at such a young age to find out that years later they really no longer have much in common andor want very different things. I think you are wasting her time by still being with her and you are wasting your own time too. I dont think you are doing her any favours by being with her. She could be single now and looking for a man with more similar views and ambitions and so can you maybe you dont want to be seeing anyone at the moment and just want to work on yourself?.I think you should ask yourself if you want what she wants and if those arent the same if you could find a middle ground or perhaps just go your own ways. I honestly do not think you are bringing anything to her and it sounds like shes a bad match for you. Just break up so she can still find a better match and you are free to find out who you are and what you want.,TheRedPill,dg9x19i,2,t5_2ve1u

11643581,0,t1_dgfpy6u,its funny cuz the idea of forming your own opinion first sounds almost intuitive yet so many people have theirs given to them by someone else. its like those people who hear gossip about someone and from that point on theyve made up their mind about said person despite not having a single conversation with them. blue pill women ive realized have a great problem in that they are generally incapable of forming opinions on their own they need the herd to collectively decide what their opinions are going to be. it means if their circle is full of blue pill sickness theyre pretty much fucked for life. its night and day what a woman like that will think of you based on what her friends think of you vs meeting you as a total stranger id like to think its a sick joke but its not.but youre basically saying that having confidence in oneself is paramount if you dont believe in your own thought processes then who the fuck will. it takes both strength and humility to be able to both assert yourself in that way but at the same time be open to change. in that sense a strong frame should be considered both fluid and solid depending on the situation. i remember you once telling me that ego is good as it provides a base of frame but at the same time its important not to let the ego rule you. its that  lifestyle you talk about.i honestly see some parts skeptic in me. i dont think i bully anyone into believing or not believing anything but when someone is bullshitting i dont like to sit there and watch them spew nonsense. on the other hand them shooting themselves in the foot is probably one of their life lessons and the right people will see through it while the wrong people were lost anyway sound about right? theres a lot of different ways to do things but why not save others the trouble of finding some things out the hard way. what are some of these blinding traps to avoid?that trust no one rings true at the end of the day. most people have some sort of agenda either their own or someone elses that they are carrying in their blue pill background program. its weird how many of these concepts seem intuitive when you think about them a lot of them a lot of us probably followed before we knew what they were. ive always gotten crap from my friends about how instead of listening to them i always had to see for myself yet how can it possibly be wrong to do it that way. society just trains people to turn their head off and follow everyone else straight into the meat grinder.,TheRedPill,dgftaqx,1,t5_2ve1u

Ive been with a few women since we broke up. Im not much of a player so its just been steady things with three girls. Two of them already had plans to leave town before we stared hooking up so they left and I went incel for awhile. Most recently started seeing a girl from high school but she lives six hours south so it was long distance. It fizzled out after awhile because I became aware that she was probably hooking up with other guys. That would have been fine had I been hooking up with other girls but I wasnt. I discovered RedPill two days ago and am working through the sidebar and Mystery Method. Sounds like I should read No More Mr. Nice guy as well.
