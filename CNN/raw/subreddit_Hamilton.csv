155600,0,t1_cew4neo,They have been at varying times. This one was actually AM. We caught one guy trying around pm another around am. I got my GPS back and could prove it was mine since I had the serial number on file. They guy had reset the GPS but it didnt full reset my recent locations were all still in the GPS. They had reprogrammed the home button and I gave that address to the cops but they said it was useless information. The address programmed in was about  blocks from where I met the guy we picked a public place downtown where I had a few friends working at the same time so he was beyond outnumbered.I gave the police multiple other Ads the guy had posted on Kijiji as well as his cell phone number. No idea if they actually followed up on anything though.The guy I got my GPS back from didnt even have a car he was riding around a bike. He was also totally retarded. it was stolen over night that morning I found the GPS on kijiji and met with him around PM so probably within  hours of it being stolen. Not much time for the GPS to remember any new places haha.Edit The police have been involved before. We had one of the video tapes on the news and it was passed around the police department. An officer recognized the guy they went and picked him up and arrested him. Weve attempted to contact police again but they were not interested as much this time since nothing was stolen from the drive way the video watches. Eventhough in the video you can see the guy go up the next driveway for a good  minutes while he was going through the neighbours car.,Hamilton,cew5kg2,3,t5_2reuj

Its not that stories involving guns are more common events its that the media highlights and repeats them more.  Or from here Only about two per cent of violent crime in Canada involved firearms the report shows. And the rate of firearmrelated violent crimes are decreasing faster than other crimes although gunrelated homicides increased slightly from  in  to  in .Gun crime while a concern tends to be exaggerated in Canada.  Were not the US we simply dont have that big a problem here.  Not enough to necessitate an armoured vehicle.Again Im not against them having this I just think we need to keep things in perspective and based on data not just what the media likes to overplay.

2875388,0,t3_2szvl4,You sound exactly like me about . years ago.  My fiance and I also lived in the same area of Toronto CollegeDufferin and moved to Hamilton in March .Anyways we moved close to CannonVictoria and we love it.  Our  bedroom bath house with a huge yard was under k and were still less than a  minute walk to JamesWaterfront as well as  min walk from International Village and about a minute from Barton Village which has crazy potential.  Theres a collection of other creative people all close by that weve been able to meet.Some of those listings seem decent.  Id stay west of Wentworth personally otherwise youre getting a little far from downtown if you want to avoid using your car.  You should be able to find something between James and Wentworth that should fit within your budget.The only truly bad areas would be north of Barton between Wentworth and Ottawa but even then its still not too bad assuming you do your research and have decent neighbors.  Id say Ive got pretty vast knowledge of the city already so If you wanted to speak outside of reddit or had any more questions let me know.  Ive generally found that advice from people who have been in Hamilton more than  years is largely useless as their opinions tend to be skewed fuck the east end downtown sucks dont go out at night etc etc.  My real estate agent was a great guy but fucking clueless about a lot of things.  He also had virtually no knowledge of Toronto so when we described things we liked in our old neighborhood and asked about similar things in Hamilton he couldnt help.You dont want to live on the mountain unless you like driving everywhere and get excited by big box stores.

The data originally compiled by the gang leader to aid in managing the organization contain detailed information on both the sources of revenues e.g. drug sales extortion and expenditrues e.g. costs of drugs sold weapons tribute to the central gang organization wages paid to various levels of the gang. Streetlevel drug dealing appears to be less lucrative than is generally though. We estimate the average wage in the organization to rise from roughly  per hour to  per hour over the time period studied. The distribution of wages however is extremely skewed. Gang leaders earn far more than they could in the legitimate sector but the actual streetlevel dealers appear to earn less than the minimum wage throughout most of our sample in spite of the substantial risks associated with such activities the annual violent death rate in our sample is . There is some evidence consistent both with compensating differentials and efficiency wages.So I dont know dude maybe you ought to just not comment on things you dont understand or something?

5315988,0,t3_3nscte,Pretty good size actually. Theres a unique mechanic of the course that Ive not seen before playing there.  During colour coordinated team matches there are three bases in the map. Destroying the base gives you a couple thousand points but it takes I think  shots to do so with a cooldown of s between hits received. The vulnerable points are on the ceiling of the base hut structure so you need to be inside to pull that off. Unless youre an absolute monster at scoring hits its very difficult to come out on top without making use of those. ,Hamilton,cvr6hn4,2,t5_2reuj

Roaches are very hard go get rid of but not impossible. Seal cracks baseboards walls counters. Leave no food out or water. Clean under your stove top daily. From what I remember the landlord has to at least attempt to rectify the situation to avoid getting in trouble. You should call the landlord and tenant board to ask what they can do to help you and what you can do to get out of your lease. If you choose to move be warned that you can still bring them with you so make sure youre prepared to replace things like your toaster or microwave if needed.,Hamilton,cwx29ek,5,t5_2reuj

I dont think Canada has such decentralized power that it is as likely to become an issue. But Im wondering if there is any kernel in it. I hope the speed of roads is determined with more than just a gut feeling and seeing records of those justifications would be cool. Anyways thanks for answering this stuff.

7032310,0,t3_4bw8rt,Hey GuysI work closely with these stores. Heres my understanding of the situation. Big Bee was attempting to be a franchise much like Hasty Market or Avondale. They then found they were paying franchise fees but not receiving adequate supportbuying powermarketing. Franchisees ditched the franchise but kept the stores altering the name slightly hence Big Bee Busy Bee Big Bear etc. Big Bee descended to a bit more of a buying power attempt much like the Korean Businessmens Association KBA.  It was to help them get better deals on things like Coke Frito etc and a better shot at gaining full lottery in store immediately which as you probably know is one very big key for a successful store cigarette license being the other and hopefully one day alcohol like in Quebec. Store owners stuck around kept the name and as they gained new stores or had family members come to town they would open new stores incorporated to a version of the name. Big Bee Food Markets Big Bee Foods Busy Bee etc. All of that said at the end of the day theres a lot of stores owned by people who were rather successful in their home countries typically Middle East for these locations but apply this statement to KBA and most other stores run by immigrants as a way to come to Canada have a business which is an easy reason to be allowed to immigrate and better their own lives but more commonly make a better place for their children to succeed in. They will then sell the business if they can to other family members or country mates so they can join in the cycle when they go to retire. Its an easy job to come to Canada where you dont need much English and often their home is attached to their workplace. Plus they have a network of people who are familiar with their culture or are even direct family members. After all this I hope when you think about going to the store now you choose the independent location where theres a trusting familiar face at the counter over the corporate Macs or PetroCanada. I work closely with corporate stores too theyre great I just have a soft spot for people who are doing their best to make money to pay for their kids education and better their familys lives for generations down the line all while sacrificing their own livelihood in their home country and comfort zoneTLDR Stores were once related had a break up and adjusted names to not infringe on franchise names. Big Bee is the main one out there still remaining. Support your local store owner when you have a choice. ,Hamilton,d1dgtw9,26,t5_2reuj

8194051,0,t3_4q98r0,This is basically the Raise the Hammer stance on vehicle and bicycle traffic in a nutshell. Its just wrong Cyclists are frequently just fine when it comes to rules of the road  theyre cautious they obey traffic laws and they dont do things like ride to the front of a queue or cross on the sidewalk when its convenient. The issue as far as I can tell is that these are the cyclists who are a silent majority the ones who arent riding in packs  wide occupying an entire lane of traffic instead of riding single file and sharing the road. Cyclists in my view are much more of a problem for Hamiltons view on cyclists. Whether its the violations above or sites like RTH that so obviously slant the truth and blast it through an echo chamber the problem is much bigger than just vehicle traffic. Bicycle users need to demonstrate the same level or courtesy as everyone else on the road before drivers get blasted in articles like this. ,Hamilton,d51t3tx,1,t5_2reuj

He hadnt stolen anything but had a knife in his hand as the cops had come up to him while he was filleting a fish for his lunch.  The officers werent charged with anything because the SIU didnt even get their notes until a week after his death  and only after the cops had colluded with their lawyer to make sure their stories matched.His mother spent her entire life savings and then some to take a case to the Supreme Court.  She won and police officers in Canada are no longer allowed to consult lawyers before turning in their notesWhich is great but it doesnt change the fact that my friend was killed and his death went unpunished despite the SIU.So I dont share your confidence that were doing ok in Ontario just because the SIU exists nor because their stats  would have you believe officers are rarely wrong.,Hamilton,d89pwwf,16,t5_2reuj

As far as our judge goes  the statement made is cleaaaarly political regardless of whether or not it is a Canadian party.
