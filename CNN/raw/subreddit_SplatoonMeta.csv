4217722,0,t1_cs0z356,oh yeah jungle hat my bad.no for real. its a fucking camo fedora. What am I  years old and on ratheism?I kind of like tenacity because Id have a period of time where Id do no painting and all of a sudden I have a charge and it occurs frequently enough that I think that the effect is not as miniscule. it might be useful to rubberband your team into a victory as a failsave so to say. It does seem that the more teammates are out simultanously the more charge you get.One kind of assholish way of testing it could be joining turf wars and only stay at spawn and let your team suffer FOR SCIENCE. recording the main screen and the gamepad and then compare how much your special meter goes up in what time when teammates are down.,SplatoonMeta,cs104yl,0,t5_38exn

4567698,0,t1_ct6658i,Hmm didnt look at how many I lost. Certainly not just  points because the other aspect is that the matchmaking doesnt seem to change. My rule these days is to lose  in a row and then quit and join a new lobby. Once Im on a losing team Im seem to get stuck with the same people.,SplatoonMeta,ct6ddkx,1,t5_38exn

It might be worth having swim speed ups to avoid confrontation as well? Dunno. would love to theorycraft things if you want. message me,SplatoonMeta,ctclj17,1,t5_38exn

4782729,0,t1_ctxdbdv,If it does then I didnt know that. I remember testing that out for roller run speed back in May and it didnt affect it so I assumed it was the same for other classes. I also had no idea until you brought it up that falling shots did less damage.I really appreciate the new information but I think I would deserve more respect than ad hominem attacks. ,SplatoonMeta,ctxeiyl,1,t5_38exn
4915099,0,t3_3i42nr,So if Im using the calculator correctly the best odds possible for getting the exact  subs you want is .? Thats with selecting  of the most probably subs.Thats rough.....,SplatoonMeta,cue33hv,1,t5_38exn
4985563,0,t3_3i8ndw,It can help to think like the players who are pinning you in based on your knowledge of how their weapons play.  If youre pinned in by chargers for example they cant fire too rapidly and eliters consume lots of ink so try going out with other teammates so each can only get one of you at a time.  For rollers theyll be working on hiding and sharking you from ink so focus on eliminating places where they can hide and preparing for ambushes from around corners.  If they counter by reinking the areas you ink theyre helping you build your special weapon which can often be used to break out of traps.If theyre in range of spawn never forget you are completely invulnerable while standing on the spawn point.  And also the further away they are from their own spawn the more costly it is to get back without superjumping and superjumping can be risky.,SplatoonMeta,cumy0sf,1,t5_38exn
5018336,0,t3_3jnucz,A general set Im working towards is Tenacity x  Ink Recovery Up Cold Blooded x  Special Charge Up Ink Resistance x  Swim Speed Up. Or thats what Im trying to get at least. It depends on your playstyle though.,SplatoonMeta,cuqwfco,1,t5_38exn
5043301,0,t3_3k0zoq,I learned to enjoy more turf wars after I got rank S and just wanted to take the game more lightly but what I see sometimes is a very nice strategic territorial war.People normally dont care about it because its not worth rank points and its not as fierce as ranked modes. ,SplatoonMeta,cutwqbx,2,t5_38exn
5062400,0,t3_3k9zf9,No wonder Ive seen so many strange things happening after I did reach S. Didnt know it was possible to get all ips on wii u. Whats that? Microsoft network monitor?,SplatoonMeta,cuw7leu,2,t5_38exn
5382050,0,t1_cvzleiw,Usually my strategy is to play much more conservatively knowing that what would normally be  in my favor will now trade  of the time. I play longerrange weapons try to play support focus on keeping our ink lines open from safe distance and I only engage if the situation is  in my favor or better. And yeah I bail under pressure most of the time. Alternatively I can load myself with quick respawnquick jump accept a bad KD as a cost of doing business and play Kraken Roller. I may die a lot but Im back in business quickly and the moment theres a hole in the enemy line Im in their base inking turf and planting beacons. ,SplatoonMeta,cvzm8sb,1,t5_38exn
