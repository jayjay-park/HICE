You have the right rhythm usually the right stressintonation and you pronounce most of the sounds perfectly.Probably the biggest things that give you away are your pronunciation of th it sounds almost like an f when you say it and your stress I think its the stress on some of your words namely the words native which your pronounced with too stronglong of a first syllable judge my accent which you very beautifully pronounced almost like one word with unfortunately too much stress on the a in accent and lastly on the word here which you pronounced more like hair.Overall though really well done especially considering you learned by talking to yourself.,JudgeMyAccent,d2qfcw5,1,t5_2ufiq

In spring the garden urns casually filled with windblown plants were gay as ever. Violets came and daffodils.

8464301,0,t1_d5zfoe8,I think your pronunciation was good but you can still clearly hear some kind of accent. Do you speak brazilian portuguese maybe? Working on an accent is pretty hard but not impossible. When you say a word look at how a native speaker would say it and if the way you say it doesnt sound exactly like their way of saying it then work on that until it does. Sometimes it comes down to very minor differences in how we produce sounds like for example in the japanese alphabet there is no real L sound the closest thing to an L is some form of R combined with a vowel. So often when theyre trying to pronounce a word in another language they are using some form of R to pronounce L. It might sound close for them but you can hear the difference. Or for example for V they use a weird form of B. Anyways my point is that you might have to learn some completely new sounds and relearn the way you pronounce certain letters and sounds. ,JudgeMyAccent,d5zkoqm,2,t5_2ufiq

I didnt know we aspirated our consonants at the beginning of words.You were assuming Im American probably because we dont have the O sound in words like I think the English accent has. Like its the difference between cot and caught right? I realize that the sound is different in Spanish I didnt catch myself when I said certain words but its good to know.
