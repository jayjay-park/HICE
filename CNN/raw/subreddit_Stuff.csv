4233477,0,t1_cs2srrd,Well out of the k subs were still only seeing a fraction of the user base the assholes making comments about Pao. But being my last comment for the night before bed the victims were never from reddit unless they actually willingly came into the sub looking to stir shit up. That is the truth by which I know it. May not be absolute but thats what I learned.The content that came from else where disregarding the imgurreddit staff shit storm came from facebooktumblryoutube posts from proobesity groups and theyre more popular members. Most of the harassment that people use as leverage was really a LOT of bantering between the sub and people like Tess Munster and various other tumblr probesity preachers.  It wasnt one way. Tess shot a lot of threats at the sub. A lot of the bantering included brigading by nonreddit users getting reddit account to storm the sub. And so then it happened the other way around.The only time Ive witnessed anything that crossed the line was when the mods posted the imgurreddit staff pictures. That was in the last few days. Its only speculation but there was talk that people knew the sub was getting banned soon so they decided to play the last remaining cards.  But thats only speculation.However remember how I said that SOME reddit users got harassed if they stirred shit up in the sub? That is true but remember most of them Ive seen come into the sub and get their smack on. That includes the HAES sub mod that you linked earlier.  Reddit users were left alone for the most part. But again some extreme assholes liked to be autistic and party on their own. ,Stuff,cs2sy4d,-2,t5_2qh28
