19171,0,t1_cebdaz8,A lot you have to make the most of those points. It is best to have a use for them in mind before hand. The more years you dont use them and if you dont get the most from them the value of the bonus goes down because you pay the fee. If you dont have a plan for the points start with a different card. The fact that it looks cool should have nothing to do with it. Get cards clear bonuses repeat. I have a Sapphire and I only spend dining on it. There are other cards much better for unbonused spend than the CSP. And there is no way I would ever spend enough on it to justify that fee. But I have an Ink so I dont need it to transfer the points. Even so your earning potential with the CSP are so limited I dont think it is great beyond the bonus.,churning,cegm6cz,1,t5_2vrf0

30174,0,t1_cehnpbv,Thats great. You should be paying every card in full every month before you think about utilizing sign up bonuses. The downside to this card is the annual fee. If youre just starting out with cards its best to start with ones you can keep open forever. Paying a  annual fee year after year will get old quick.

31302,0,t3_1u9prx,Imho I would avoid using Chase for the prepaid side of a MS equation especially if you are using their cards for the CC side of it.  Chase has arguably some of the best and varied offers in the game.  Being blacklisted by them is a serious setback for any churner.  Trying to utilize a product of theirs for both sides of MS might be risky.However YMMV and everyones comfort level differs.  If you are comfortable with it do some research and play around. Make sure you report back Also in regards to VRBB I think it is preferred at least by me due to having no fees and being the easiest to unload billpaywithdraw is what I normally use.  I just started playing with a moneypak card and have had a good time just doing multiple transactions with  cash back at the supermarket.  Only tried it once for  separate transactions so I dont know if continued use will arouse suspicion at the supermarket or my prepaid cards end.,churning,cehzuk8,1,t5_2vrf0

942459,0,t3_24vxyf,put this in another thread but I feel like it might answer your question All I can say is over last year Ive noticed Chase getting a bit more picky with their business applications. Not sure if you have an actual business or if you stated a sole prop. but be ready to be questioned about it. I had Chase go as far as to check my ebay ID in hopes of finding history of my sales. Luckily I did have a few posts left in my history which is enough to convince the guy.Definitely do Amazon payments though. Its a free k per month. The rest of your apps sound like a solid plan but depending on where you are you might get hit with  Experian inquiries. I know in southern california where im from all  of these apps would hit EXP.If thats the case consider a barclay card Arrival US airways etc or US bank Club Carlson Visa  This hit Transunion for me but others have reported it as EXP instead of one of the chase ones. I believe the Club Carlson to be a good substitute for the IHG since card members can book  nights for .,churning,chbewsk,2,t5_2vrf0

That having been said there are no fee cards that are pretty good general spend cards I.e. Fidelity Amex is  cash back on all transactions no cap no annual fee Sallie Mae MasterCard has back in gas and groceries up to a limit. Some annual fee cards will give you a points bonus on your anniversary if you threaten to cancel.CSP and Arrival are pretty decent cards. You can use CSP to transfer points to an airline like United to use for flights with them if they travel your route. Arrival is more like a cash back card that will pay for travel expenses.

1581013,0,t3_2cd9rf,It depends on how you redeem the rewards. If you are into quantity i.e. ok with staying at cheap motels want a lot of domestic travel in coach over quality staying in  star luxury resorts first class international travel.For arrival you get a . return on what you spend. Period end of discussion. For every  spent you get  dollars in free travel.For UR if you transfer to some of the partners and want to redeem for quality luxury vacations you can get significantly more than  centsUR point. That makes  UR points spent equal to significantly more than  in free travel.However if you are ok with low cost hotels and want quantity i.e. flying coach then Arrival may be better. Personally I am not a fan of resort hotels since the only thing I plan to do in my hotel room is sex sleep shower and shit. I couldntt care less what the pool is like I will probably never use it. As long as the room is clean and has a comfie mattress Im good. So I like the fact that I can use Arrival to pay for AirBnB you can get a weeks stay in a studio apartment for the cost of one night in a nice hotel.Like others have said is they complement each other.

BUT it may be a decent card to hold on to because depending on the one you received you may actually be able earn  ThankYou Points to the dollar on restaurants books music and movies. Keep in mind Amazon.com classifies itself as a bookstore! That card is not offered anymore so you may want to hold on to it. The highest amount of ThankYou points one can now get comes from the TY Premier  ppds  dining and entertainment and that card has a  AMF.The Citi Diamond preferred card may or may not be eligible for conversion depending on many factors thing is the Diamond preferred card is not really a rewards card granted I would always recommend converting out of this card.And the Simplicity card has a very unique structure of terms in that you have a fixed APR in that you can not request or receive an APR reduction but in exchange you have no late fees or penalty rate hikes if you happen to be late. So for the same reason as the Forward card the difference in term structure may prevent a conversion. ,churning,cn7gqbh,3,t5_2vrf0

2798074,0,t1_cnkinl4,Honestly youre over thinking it. Neural scoring models change or should constantly depending on general fraud trends being seen by financial institutions. There is no way for you to know consistently because there is no way for you to know national trends. There are some general points... Merchant Category Code  Standard Industrial Classification code  grocery stores including Walmart are by far the most common location for counterfeit fraud and therefore will ultimately be subjected to the most scrutiny.  Retail Department Store is an often used backup for stores like Walmart and Target as well and will likewise be similarly scored. Following that places like  CVSWalgreens   Macys  Home Depot  inside gas  payatthepump  Dollar General  Best Buy  Toys R Us  liquor stores will all be given much more scrutiny in fraud scoring to varying degrees. Holiday models were recently in place with that likewise being the busiest time of the year for fraud. Even dollar amounts prepaid giftcard amounts . etc. and the like will similarly be scored higher. The biggest financial institutions ultimately had the toughest time keeping up with all the various merchant breaches. This left them exposed to literally millions of atrisk cards. It is incredibly difficult to manage and track all cards that are atrisk at this point and subjecting them to unique scoring  scrutiny  while possible  is definitely a challenge. Many for practical reasons simply turned up the authorization screening on their entire portfolio. Meaning more situations like this. ,churning,cnm4pwd,1,t5_2vrf0

3438481,0,t1_cpk744u,To be honest I dont know. I dont think it matters for Barclays as we have many people me included churning them with no product change. Citi Hhonors is easily churned without closing also. With chase most cards cant be PCed the only two that come to mind are the United Personal to the United no fee card and the CSP to a cashback card. Personally I have closed them because there are so many other Chase cards to apply for that I dont want credit wasted on them. There is potential in the idea that by doing a product change you convert a card from unchurnable into churnable. Essentially youre trying to get the bank to think you never had the original card by changing the name in their system. I have not heard of this working yet but if it does presumably Amex would be where it is most useful based on their one bonus per lifetime rules.,churning,cpk7nve,2,t5_2vrf0

Id wager that youd come out ahead with the Citi Prestige on the current  AF offer going on rather than the silver depending on how much you value business redemptions of miles.The Prestige will have an effective AF of  after the  air credit. Youll be earning x points on ALL airfare AND hotels as well as x on entertainment. At the . cents a point when redeemed for USAA flights thats . back on all flights and hotels. That goes up to . if youre citigold.Now your valuation of miles may vary but considering the hassle of finding award space at the times and rates you want along with the EQMs and RDMs you DONT get by booking awards the Citis earnings are at least on par.Oh but my k EQMs for k spend baaaaaw!! Well suck it up private. If you spend over k youll be able to fly over k miles you wouldnt get EQMs for with the Silver.Oh and its got AA lounge access and Priority Pass.At the end of the day  net fee with admirals club access and EQMs on rewards is absolutely going to trump the  silver for elite AA flyers.,churning,cpnfe4q,1,t5_2vrf0

But theres absolutely no difference to the bank between someone doing  is MS spend and sockdrawing the card vs. someone who does the same after doing a natural  spend. Banks are fully aware that part of the cost of acquiring new profitable customers includes picking up some unprofitable ones on the way. Luckily this hobby requires diligence that most arent willing to endure and theyre arent enough of us yet to make it worth the expense of purging the unprofitable. In the crazy world of Wall Street you may even be more valuable as a statistic in the annual report than your contribution to the bottom line.gtIf enough idiots take to the streets hard and banks notice that pattern gravy train will end in no time.Ive been churning since . I have had a good share of fraud alerts. Every time I call the bank say it was me verify my identity and Im free to try again. One time Barclays gave me trouble on a reasonable  first charge attempt and didnt clear the card. Said Id have to do that weird cash advance attempt thing at a bank to prove my identity.

Although you would technically get more rewards by paying Netflix from gift cards bought at grocery stores you would also need to spend time making a transaction on your BBR card every month.Assuming a  monthly Netflix subscription and a  cashback rate on the gift card that gives you less than  back every year. In my eyes that is a small price to pay for automation.

As other commenters have pointed out splitting a single purchase onto  cards will vary based on the specific cards that you are using. But if you buy a flight with one card and a hotel with a different card in  separate transactions then each transaction would be protected by the card that paid for that transaction. i.e. If your flight was delayed you could contact the card that you used to pay for your flight to get reimbursement. If you have a problem with your hotel room you would contact the card that you used to pay for the room not the card that paid for the flight.,churning,csdth8h,1,t5_2vrf0

Lets start here. Flights from chicago to anywhere in the country are max k each. Flights under  miles are only .k each. Thats incredible frankly. Where else can you get flights for k roundtrip?. This means as long as you can find a direct american airlines flight they are at least as valuable as AA miles. The downside is that youll pay more for adding connections. At least in most cases?

5237684,0,t3_3mqxpq,To answer your questions So the  annual fee would be hard to justify next year and Im not sure itd be good to close the card?Yes its hard to justify the  fee unless you use the companion ticket. Would it be a good idea to sign up get the bonus and then next year request to downgrade to the standard Delta Amex?You can certainly downgrade to the gold version after the first year. But still that card has  fee. Also if you use amex offers a lot you can simply offset the  fee. keep in mind that amex has  per life bonus restriction meaning you can only get the bonus once on each card. If you downgrade to the gold you would burn that potential k bonus on that card. There is a lower grade card Options card which I think has a  fee. You might be able to downgrade the card to some nondelta card. I changed my gold to hhonors nofee card. You probably want to keep your rd card for longevity of your credit report.

Dont use the points for cashback though of course let them sit in your account and try for a CSP in a year after some of your accounts age so they dont count for the  rule anymore and do not apply for anything for at least a year after getting the freedom hard I know but if you want a CSP youll need to.

It also will only give those estimated scores for your EQ and TU reports.Given that Experian is the hardest hit bureau for most people it makes sense that your score is slightly lower if you have a lot of inquiries. Also the FAKO scores can vary widely from actual scores because theyre estimates. You can get your report not score from each bureau for free once a year. You can see if there are any errors there. If they give you a lower APR because of your score or took any other negative action based on your score then that also entitles you to a free report from Experian. You can also pay Experian a dollar for a trial membership in their monitoring service which would give you your score. ,churning,cx2ax2u,4,t5_2vrf0

Generally speaking if you find availability on BA it will be bookable with AA. I say generally speaking because BAs site has a known glitch where it will show phantom award availability if you are not searching segment by segment. So when you search BA look for BWIMIA then MIASCL then SCLEZE and vice versa. Since these are partner award flights they would be at the discounted saaver rates.,churning,cx4rg33,1,t5_2vrf0

5731098,0,t3_3tlyb3,I am one of the administrators for my companys corporate credit card account.  We held our annual companywide meeting at one of the hotels on this list in early March during the window where this occurred.  While I cant prove the cause of course I can say that we had a SIGNIFICANT jump in fraud issues on our corporate cardholders this summer.  We went from having maybe one fraud alert per week to having closer to  per week for a period that lasted a couple months.  We had to close and reissue several dozen cards and dispute a LOT of unauthorized transactions.  Now that Ive seen this Id bet good money this is the reason why.  Almost every one of our cardholders bought food and drinks at the restaurant and bar inside the hotel because we were there for the better part of a week and barely left the property.In the end our bank made us whole but it caused a LOT of extra work for our finance team.,churning,cx7hyrz,8,t5_2vrf0

5839552,0,t3_3v5897,The problem with this strategy is that you have only one so many opportunities for credit card signups. This forum and flyertalk is full of people who post their initial entrance into the miles game  which we all have had. We walk away with kmn points right?A better test if you ask me is to see how you are doing  or  years down the road. You will have exhausted the signup opportunities and you will be earning points from the little promos and stays that you do have.The problem with people who are only burning  and not earning is that yeah  they never replace the milespoints that they burn because they really dont travel every week. And then finally  you have no status. So unless you book premium travel  you dont get the benefits like a weekly traveler.,churning,cxl3buo,5,t5_2vrf0

5880315,0,t1_cxpwphg,It really depends what kind of points... I MS british airways currently because of the high spend bonus.  I do light MS on my PRG because x at grocery stores.  After the BA spend is over I think Ill start to split it between that and the Hyatt card.  I figure that it costs me about . to MS k depends on the exact fees.  I also do NW Buxx at way less than that only  per k.  So I just figure out what I think the points are worth based on redemptions I actually use not just a random cpm somebody else came up with.  For example for me domestic flights are rarely worth it  I live near KC so there are no long haul flights.  I only use avios or SW for domestic redemptions or pay cash.  Coast to coast flights can be great for .k points though.For me to do it the k MS must translate into at least  doubling the money.  For BA currently I get about . miles per dollar spent  total points for spending k more.   avios is easily worth .  For the PRG I try to wait for a bonus on either skymiles or avios.  even without a bonus though  skymiles is usually worth  for me. as someone already said SPG points are valuable.   ,churning,cxqfwvh,1,t5_2vrf0

Their savings account and money market rates are similarly pathetic.I think the only sensible way its worthwhile is if you hold investments with Merrill Edge. You get  free stock trades per month so you should be able to hold your typical Vanguard or whatever ETFs there without ever paying Merrill any fees. Otherwise if you put k in a BoA deposit account with their pathetic rates it would take a significant amount of MS to breakeven let alone meaningfully exceed considering the opportunity cost of depositing funds there.

They took my details opened a case for me and emailed me the details phone number to contact and email  physical address to send documents to.  After I returned the car and got the damage report from the rental agency Thrifty IIRC I scanned and emailed everything to them.  A month or so later the rental company sent me an email asking for my insurance details where they could send the bills for the repairs.  I gave them the benefit providers contact details and my case number.  Those guys sorted it out among themselves.  A month or so later I got an email from the benefit provider detailing the cost before and after negotiations between the two parties and closing the case.Simple efficient and not a cent out of my pocket.  The repairs were worth the annual fees four times over.  Comprehensive insurance from the rental company covering the period I had the car was half of the annual fees.Any questions ask away.  Im on my phone but will get to my computer in a bit. ,churning,cz7azl6,16,t5_2vrf0

Even the newest Softserve accounts are almost a year old already. On the other hand it does seem that the recently opened accounts have been mostly untouched and there are a lot of data points on those since a lot of people switched back to Serve a few months ago when Redbird truly died.Im not saying that the age is a factor in the shutdown decision its probably just because the longer youve held an account the more chances youve had of doing the things that triggered the shutdowns.,churning,czafq9f,2,t5_2vrf0

6423320,0,t3_43jcas,I know nothing scientific about how AA does partner availability  but anecdotally the evidence for this is pretty strong STL to ORD is a great example of a  avios flight.  If you look out  months many most flights show either no award availability or some with  or  seats.  If you wait until the last minute less than  weeks those same flights will almost all show  award seats available.  That was the best value for me with Avios on AA.  Those last minute flights in cash would be over k rt or just k avios and you were guaranteed to have plenty of last minute award availability.  So with tomorrows devaluation I would love to book some summer flights but there isnt any good availability.

If you dont do any MS you should be OK.If you do MS keep in mind that if you go too hard and get shut down it may prevent your parents from doing business with Chase in the future.,churning,cztg0es,6,t5_2vrf0

6529285,0,t3_451pg9,It is a decent good deal. Let me throw some numbers AF of Prestige is  since   apply in branch   refund ticket.  AF of ATampT is . However you earn k TYP annually for spending k a year and that easily offsets the AF. In fact k TYP is  towards AA ticket. If you spend .... every month youll reach that limit of k a year. So the question is  is your monthly rent with . radpad fee around that value? Assume your monthly rent is . a month in other words k a year without radpad fee. So youll pay  in radpad fee annually. However youll earn k TYP. If you redeem k towards AA that is  value. In other words a net  profit annually. It also earns x on atnt but you should have chase ink for that and x on amazon there are plenty of better options. theres also the signup bonus.edit couple of you are asking me if I can do the math for you. I would be happy to but at the same time here is a quick way to figure it out yourself. a The dude in   is paying k annually.     b How much are you paying annually?   c How much do you have to multiply k by to get your annual rent? For example if you are paying k annually then the you need to multiply by . because k x .  k  d Do you have this scaling factor . in above example? Now multiply the profit or points earned of dude in   with this scaling factor and bam that is your profit or points earned.  ,churning,czuohbo,9,t5_2vrf0

The only exception would be someone who actually wantshas ATampT already and especially someone who wants a new retail price phone.The real value of the card is the x on some internet retailers and the k bonus which means its a x card on k of spending for which there is no category bonus elsewhere. Its not that hard to MS and get this benefit.   TYP are at least worth  and the  opportunity cost is .   So its a  a year card which is worth it as a downgrade.,churning,czuwxmc,8,t5_2vrf0

6620087,0,t3_46cmoh,Im flying my parents RT to Turkey this summer on TK business class. They are older and really get a lot of benefit out of lieflat seats. Plus the marginal difference between that and economy was k Aeroplan miles each before their last devaluation in December so it was a large upgrade in their comfort and their ability to enjoy the first couple days of their trip for a less than  increase in cost. Plus it felt nice to be able to do that for them. Im flying my wife and I one way business and the other way economy. Eastbound travel tends to take me and most people I think longer to adjust to jetlagwise so being more comfortable on the way over should be a plus. Also weve never flown an international premium cabin so it will be nice to experience. Going forward however I dont forsee a lot of premium class travel for me in the near future. Points and miles are not free. They have an opportunity cost. Someone who just used k UR to book a one way A business class flight just paid  for that flight. A bargain for that flight perhaps but still  cash that could have gone towards student loans a mortgage craft beer or a few car payments. And with issuers always clamping down further on opportunities to easily and repeatedly get points from signup bonuses  Amex  per lifetime Citi  month rule and shutting the WE loophole etc and airlines devaluing miles more for premium cabin space Id rather stretch what I have. Sure Im not getting  cpm or whatever dumb valuation from those points if I were to get Singapore Suites also fuel surcharges much?. But Im saving the  that I most definitely would have paid anything to go visit my wifes family during peak season by using  UA miles to book those tickets. Outsized value? No. But with the manufactured spend cost and the opportunity cost of getting new cards Im still coming out ahead enough for my tastes. ,churning,d042ofa,52,t5_2vrf0

If you want to be aggressive could try for  Apps soon and try to get  more in next month before the change.   All being Chase this is unlikely to work well but could be worth the risk.  In terms of what  cards that you should focus on if you want Chase Companion Pass then next  are both Southwest Cards.  Otherwise Ink is probably first choice with nd choice being any of the better options SW Prem Hyatt IHG United.,churning,d0tmul3,2,t5_2vrf0

There is also the ability to get another k annually through spend at grocery stores. People go ham over the PRG but its points structure is much less appealing than the EDP IMO.

6907992,0,t3_45mosa,I have been trying to get the Chase IHG for a while and decided to apply for it on . I got the pending screen and saying that will be notified in writing within  days or  days. I got impatient and sent a secure message. Someone replied saying they will forward the message to the appropriate department. I waited again and nothing. So I decided to call the CSP number I have a CSP so I can speak to a live person right away they checked and it is still pending. I finally called Chase lending services and he took some info put me on hold told me again it was pending. I checked this morning and I see it on my account online which means I was approved and the card is well on its way.    Take home message      Secured message is still a viable way of communicating but they have to forward to the right department. Which takes time.      If you have CSP you can quickly check the status of your application using the number but they do not have the approving power.      I applied  and approved . If I had waited I might not have been approved because my application is just sitting there and they needed more information to approve me.    Interesting Data point     I just checked credit karma. I know it is not a  reliable source but sometimes is useful for ball park estimates. I monitor all my Hard Pulls and I am expecting to this one in. However I saw that my recent HP was from April   and it is from CHASE. According to my records I never applied for anything on April . Heck from  alone I never applied. I just an apporama on  and on recovery mode in . So I was wondering if it has something to do with the leap year?

If you travel a lot and routinely make good redemptions with your UR points typically first class international flights then you may be coming out ahead vs a  card although probably not by a huge amount.The advantage of the DC is the simple  cash with no worrying about what  you redeem it for. Pure  which is a great value for daily spending and you can do what you want with it. If the UR programs redemptions change you may be sitting on a bunch of points that suddenly become less valuable and you could have been using DC the whole time. Not to dissuade you from the UR program of course plenty of people love it. But I think its best suited for someone who is traveling very often. One or two trips a year...probably better off with cash back. So it just depends. Of course you can redeem the FU points for cash but thats still only . not . ,churning,d15mlpj,2,t5_2vrf0

My fiance just got approved for the Marriott k offer and now were looking at what other Chase card to get her before this  rule hits the cobranded cards. I think its between either the Fairmont card or the IHG card. Fairmont  free nights would give us a great weekend getaway to a really nice property. The IHG card would get us k points   statement credit at the very least if I cant also get her matched to the k offer.IHG card is awesome because of the annual free night but who knows if that will get nerfed or removed at some point in the near future. Fairmont properties are obviously few and far between compared to IHG properties but there are some really nice ones that we would love to stay at.Someone tip the scales for me help me make this decision easier!!   firstworldproblems churningproblems,churning,d1jyd8i,2,t5_2vrf0

7217396,0,t3_4e8jcq,Sorry for your loss. We arent in quite the same boat yet but similar. My husbands grandma is done with chemo. Not healed but just done. Doctors give her anywhere from one day to one year. He really wanted to go see her asap they live in Ohio but we had a planned vacation to Jamaica next week flying out of Baltimore. He didnt want to skip the trip but knew hed regret it if he didnt go see her and something happened. So I shifted the dates slightly and moved the flight from Baltimore RT to Pittsburg RT about an hour from where they live. Not only will he get to see his grandma before we go but the entire change only cost us  more in taxesfees and we managed to save k rapid rewards points just by switching airports. Flexibility in the face of family health problems makes this whole thing worth it. Glad you had that cost burden lifted off your shoulders. ,churning,d1yk8wt,3,t5_2vrf0

7221302,0,t3_4ecr5t,I think there is a red herring of churning rarely spoken about. That is the incidentals of travelling to exotic places that you would never of dreamed you would be able to visit. Every Trip Report post you see just talks about the free flights and hotels never how much other stuff cost and was spent while there.The temptation of a night on town in Japan or an uber fancy dinner in France because I saved X on flights and X on hotels so while I am here why not really experience it mentality and the fact that MS allows you to float your money back and forth between credit cards so you dont have to incur interest charges gets people into a world of trouble.News flash folks  just because you are floating K of debt between  credit cards and not getting hit with interest does not mean it is not still debt.I have over K in total credit line amoungst all my cards and the reason why I owe  dollars on them is because it scares me to think how easy it would be to do fall that deep into debt that you will never get out of.Be Careful and Good Luck!,churning,d1z09m3,50,t5_2vrf0

7242144,0,t1_d21d42u,Not even a little bit churning related butPenske offered to upgrade me to a larger  truck for no cost over the  one. What could go wrong? I thought. So we did that. Our new place was in an area where the streets are already narrow and many people park on the side anyway. So here I am driving this giant ass truck thinking Im doing a remarkable job. I park nearby and get out to go talk to my roommate about our plan for where were going to unload. While Im doing that this biker pulls up and tells me I side swiped his buddys car with the giant truck. I had no idea didnt feel a thing. I apologized and gave him insurance info and he rode off. Later we looked for the busted car but didnt actually see anything.So we get the giant truck into the new apartments tiny parking lot and unload. The trick is getting the giant truck back out. There isnt enough space to turn it around easily. Thankfully the lot is just about empty. Theres just one other car so we think we can carefully maneuver around it and get out of the lot via an alleyway without having to back the truck back out of the driveway. So my roommate and I are trying to communicate to turn the giant truck maybe  degrees to get it lined up into the alleyway without hitting a nearby dumpster. Its a big loud diesel truck so were having trouble communicating. My roommate gets frustrated Im nervous as hell driving that thing and wont ever back up as far as he tells me to so he decides to take the wheel. Hes a bit overzealous and backs up without hearing me to stop and takes out the entire driver side of that one unfortunate car in the lot. Oops. Not a scratch on the truck though.What happened? Well Penske called me and said the biker dude reported the first accident. I had bought the insurance for the truck but hadnt  bought liability insurance because MN law requires the rental price to include that. I called later to report the second accident but the office wanted me to pay out of pocket in spite of the law I quoted. I asked to talk to someone in corporate and I got their voicemail. She didnt call me back an hour later so I reported it to State Farm. As a matter of fact she never called me back at all actually. State Farm instructed me to return the truck refuse to pay any additional costs to Penske and theyd take care of it. I figured at some point Id get a bill for a deductible from them but  months later the incident was switched to closed and I learned my agent had fought the issue on my behalf. They did report one accident on my record probably never proved the second one but my insurance went up a whole . a month so I was ok with it. The whole thing was really stressful at the time so I went to the state fair and gorged on poutine after the truck was returned. And then I refused to drive and took the bus to work for a couple of weeks.tldr Dont take a free upgraded moving truck and no insurance but the rental companys or your personal auto insurance will cover box trucks.,churning,d21dnt8,20,t5_2vrf0

Citibanks Double Cash card is also pretty good.  cash back on all purchases and another  on all payments assuming you pay every statement balance in full. You may also want to check out U.S. Banks Cash card. Every quarter you choose I think one  and two  cash back categories every quarter.I also suggest diversifying card networks i.e. Visa and issuers i.e. Chase.

If you get credit for the flight and thus are not invoiced for it then it wouldnt make sense to submit an expense report.Likewise what if you were to receive say  miles for your inconvenience which I would imagine is the more common scenario.

Are you able to cover using some MS or pure organic spending?If you can swing it CSP should be the one to go because at the worst it can be used for  cashback when you hit the min spend and AU. AF waived first year so you should be paying nothing out of pocket.MR is not really cashable unless you have Schwab so I recommend flexible points that can be cashed out as signup bonuses are what makes this hobby worth it.Ink too if you can get it k when you hit min spend which would equal to  in statement credit but with AF the first year unless applied in branch.It may be good to start with Chase cards at early stages not only because they are lucrative but because they cant be obtained later down the road unless you go slow.,churning,d40sstb,2,t5_2vrf0

The DoubleCash earns  on everything so its a better cashback card than the Citi ThankYou.  The advantage to requesting a product change is that Citi wont pull your credit report and your average age of accounts wont go down like it would if you just opened a new DoubleCash card.  The Chase Freedom has a signup bonus equal to about  as straight cash plus it has rotating  categories like Discover including  on restaurants for July August and September.  In general the signup bonuses from credit cards are better than the ongoing rewards.  As long as you can be organized and always pay everything on time try open a couple or more! new cards per year with good signup bonuses.,churning,d4tg6ao,1,t5_2vrf0

For that it would really help to fly TK since obviously TK has the most flights into IST.. The ease of booking as you say is dramatically different. Booking KE flights is like from another world. . There will be fees on KE. From ATL this might be doable with reasonable fees since there will be DL flights into Europe and intraeurope fees will be a lot less than if OP needed to travel Air FranceKLM across the atlantic. . KE awards on partners are round trip only. So all the above have to work both waysAll in all I think my recommendation would be the same get an Ink or a CSP. But you are right in that KE might be worth exploring. IF there is availability on the dates needed AND the OP is willing to go through the KE process and the fees end up being reasonable it would save K miles.,churning,d522jfr,2,t5_2vrf0

I had the exact same scenario   transfers in the same day.  Contact Hyatt at the guest services number .  In the end I had to escalate by emailing a Hyatt executive that I located on linkedin.  Magically they figured out their mistake the next day.  The people from the guest services number called back and apologized for the issue and made sure the points were issued properly. Edit  I should add that while the Southwest reps are great to work with there is nothing they can see or do in this matter.  Also if the names in the Hyatt and Southwest systems do not match exactly the points get rejected on the Southwest side.

You can get anywhere from  to  off a new car to basically just above dealer invoice levels.Normally a person couldnt join this but a few years ago someone figured out that just joining the online forum Mustang Club of America gave you access.Sign up for an account on mustang.org then go to  and use MC as the code.

8411184,0,t1_d5swysg,The standard suggestions here would be to get the Ink or the sapphire preferred. The signup bonus on the csp is K  K UR points when adding an authorized user. There is also a referral bonus so if your SO has a csp they can refer you. If not consider using a referral link from our sub. The signup bonus on the Ink is K with annual fee waived if you apply in branch right now highest ever. I would encourage you to do that if you have an established business. They will likely grill you on how old your business is and what it does.If you dont have an established business you can apply for the ink online use a referral link from our sub! for K  AF not waived and hopefully still get matched to K although youll still have to pay the AF.The problem with the Ink is that it might not ship in time. So I would go for csp first for you and then if you wanna gamble go for Ink larger bonus or if not get a Southwest card. The alternative would be to get BOTH southwest cards. You need to spend  cumulatively on both and you will get the southwest companion pass for all of  and  but you must make all the spend and have the statement cut by end of .

My recommendation is price out the trip and see what is the cheapest to transfer from MR.  Tools like awardhacker would help with this.  Also getting to Scotland and then flying around Europe is going to be on two different tickets so it makes sense to price them out separately.

8717956,0,t3_4zexwa,When we launched our promotion with Stripe and Android Pay a little over two weeks ago allowing Android users to pay rent with a credit card through Android Pay for no fee we had no idea just how many people would sign up. Within days of the announcement the promotion spread like wildfire across social media blogs Reddit and other news outlets.Prior to the promotion Android Pay users represented less than  of all rent payments on RadPad. Six days after the promotion Android Pay users represented  and the number continues to climb. Thousands of renters have signed up in the last two weeks to pay their rent using Android Pay equating to more than M in rents.Although we are overwhelmed that the promotion has gained so much traction we drastically underestimated just how many people would sign up to pay their rent with Android Pay and within only a few weeks weve surpassed the budget for the entire year that was allocated to subsidize the credit card fee.That is why we regret to inform everyone that beginning today August th  we will no longer be able to offer the Android Pay promotion.Anyone who signed up and qualified for the promotion prior to August th  will still enjoy free credit card fees as long as their rent is charged on or before August  . However we will not be able to offer the promotion through the end of the year. After August   the regular . fee will apply if you choose to continue using your credit card through Android Pay.As an alternative to credit you can also utilize one of the following payment optionsSwitch to ACH on RadPads website freeSwitch to Debit . feeWe want to apologize to all of our users that were hoping to utilize this promotion through the end of the year. We understand the confusion amp anger this has caused many of you and rightfully so.

8798185,0,t1_d74xpva,Do you have a prechip CSP?  Prechip CSP is much heavier.    My wife and I just received our cards the other day and we actually got  shipments of cards so  total.  Its very obvious that Chase is scrambling to meet demand and are totally rushing and cutting corners to just get cards out.  Of the  cards received the placement of the printing of the actual design doesnt match up on any of the cards. The design and CSR branding are crooked and dont align properly on any of the  cards.  Also the embossing is crooked and doesnt align properly on any of the cards.  On one card my name on the back is embossed on top of the Not valid without Authorized Signature disclaimer and on one card the subscript first  digits of the card number are embossed over the Good Thru text.  Also a couple of the cards are rough around the edges and werent smoothed out properly.I know its primarily about the bonus and benefits but I have to say the design overall of this card is a huge disappointment especially when compared side by side with the CSP.  I know black with credit cards is associated with exclusivity but the royal blue of the CSP was just so nice.  Also the design on the top right corner looks very low resolution.  In addition the card already in just a couple of days is showing wear from being swiped.  ,churning,d75f6v4,3,t5_2vrf0

Then CP the CSP to CSR and Ill have two CSR.  In August the annual fee for the first CSR will be due and Ill CP that to the FU.  Then Ill keep the second CSR for a long time.

8949860,0,t1_d7lhfaj,Opinions are like noses...everyone has one.  MW defines windfall as follows an unexpected amount of money that you get as a gift prize etc.The   UR points we will receive in the next  months or so from  CSRs and  CSP and the required spends are not windfalls at all to us.  Rather they are part of a very strategic plan I developed and have executed over the last couple of years.  We had specific travel plans and goals with associated budgets.  My goal was to use our excellent credit income and low credit utilization as leverage for acquiring credit cards that would earn the biggest bonuses possible with a goal of a minimum of  in travel value.  My wife and I travel a lot.  it is a passion of ours.  We spemd monry on experiences not things.  We live frugally drive  year old cars have a modest home with a very small mortgage payment.No my friend...this is no windfall for us.  It is part of a well executed plan that has reduced the cost of some quite expensive travel we planned to South Africa Antarctica and Peru.  You are correct that we would not spend an average of  per night to stay at  and  hotels without these points  Since we DO have the points however this becomes possible.  These points have effectively reduced our travel cost for  different trips by  .  You may not agree with our choices but please dont tell me I am blowing our money.

We also liked the Asiana business lounge quite a bit in ICN massage chairs!  The Lounges were really the highlight of the trip. I was sorely disappointed in the SEA Centurion lounge. The workers there seemed to know very little english and it was jam packed with people. Good luck finding a seat if its mildly busy especially since half the lounge was closed due to construction.

9169083,0,t1_d8e52jb,The only time you really have to worry about a clawback when youre following the rules is when you return something that counted toward your minimum spend to get your sign up bonus.For example You buy a  TV when you get your card.  That  counted for  of your min spend.  You spend another  within the first three months of opening your card.  Six months later the TV breaks.  You contact the merchant instead of the manufacturer to see if they will help you out.  The merchant wants you to be happy so they offer you a refund.  Your card is refunded .  You dont think much about it but a month later you see that your point balance is significantly reduced by the amount of your sign up bonus.  In this scenario you technically did not meet your minimum spend.  You might have luck explaining your situation and the card issuer will reverse the clawback or give you additional time to complete your minimum spend but you might also be SOL.Thats really the only scenario where you have to worry about clawbacks when youre not MSing.,churning,d8e8zj6,3,t5_2vrf0

You can indeed recon in this situation but it is my understanding that success hinges on you having established good credit since the BK.

So I dont spend a lot on gas phone department stores or any of the places that Plenti seems to work with. I love to travel though. I use points as an excuse to go places and do things I normally wouldnt do due to cost of the plane ticket.

Have you examined your monthly statement? Some calendar months  days in the month may impact what I said.gtIf you are still confused call the number on the back of your card.

9354854,0,t1_d91eugh,Prestige and CSR are completely different breeds bc of their th annual night and golf perk. Those are perks that can bleed cash an institution ongoing. CSR doesnt have such perks. Their biggest perks may be signup bonus and ongoing x points. However those arent hard cash loss. There are strict limitations on it making it much favorable to the bank. Like redeeming award is much harder than earning for an average joe. Unless customers transfer them to travel partners they arent strictly recorded as cost. In the worst event they can devalue.In fact if you see how long they let their Ink Cash and Plus to continue to exist CSR isnt such a big deal esp. considering that the target is high income spender and thus could potentially bring high income customers.,churning,d91smfp,2,t5_2vrf0

9676068,0,t3_5dlumb,Barclays really frustrated me this week. Ive never had a Barclays card before and received a mailer for the Arrival. Since I plan on going for either the Ameriprise Plat AA Plat second one using mailer SPG Delta Plat or any combo of those cards soon I wanted to snag the A while I was still under  inquiries in the past  months.I used the invite code from the mailer and my app went pending. I checked on Tuesday and it was still pending. I updated CK and EX apps and find I had a HP from Barclays on both TU and EX one day apart. TU was showing  HPs and EX had . Thinking they now saw  HPs instead of gt I call them up to see if Ive been denied or what. I go through their process and Im approved!but with a  CL. Ive had no other Barclays cards before and I knew Barclays was stingy with CLs but I was not expecting something that low.I even asked if there was any way to raise the CL and their reply was essentially because of all the recent cards I had opened they wanted to see how I handled this limit. I meanI guess a year isnt a long time but none of those new cards have ever had super high balances and all of them have been paid on time.I still really frustrated that for a HP on EX and TU I got a  CL.Does anyone know if Barclays cares about cycling your CL once or twice a month?,churning,da5s1c4,4,t5_2vrf0

They also said account becomes dormant after  months and then turned over to the state  months after that.  They said you cant fund an account through a credit card told me some BS that its so much easier to visit a branch.  They require picture of your licence originally they said they also require SSN card but later backed out of such claim  I wonder whether the reps themselves bank with their own CU?.Called RBFCU.  Was told you can put up to k on a VISAMC in total for account opening coded as purchase hold of about a week or so they confirmed thanks uTravelingTrex you can deposit MO online said you dont even need to install an app can just use the website w a scanner but you do need to wait  days prior to online deposit.  However they confirmed multiple times that even if you decline overdraft protection they still do a hard pull which also appears to be somewhat documented in their TampC too.  They claim they use TU.Is TU hard pull worth RBFCU membership?  I specifically asked them if there is any way to avoid it and that I dont want overdraft protection they said that their system is limited and its always done.  What do you guys think?  Is there any way to dispute it with TU without upsetting RBFCU?  Is that even legal to do a hard pull of a credit report if no credit is being sought or extended?P.S. For completeness I also asked RBFCU about inactivity  they have a mo fee after mo in their Fee Schedule.  They said its independent in each account.  If you have above  in your share savings  minimum and dont use it for  mo theyll start taking out mo until  even if you do use other accounts but I think the rep may have been guesstimating...,churning,db8wqq5,2,t5_2vrf0

10004128,0,t1_dbbgjjf,Its almost impossible to compare the two items. Cars not only have very different expectations they are significantly more susceptible to user damage. It is reasonable to assume little to no user damage on a  month old laptop outside of cosmetic issues. The same cannot necessarily be said for a car that has been driven  miles. However as far as car chargebacks are concerned.If you bought that car using a credit card you may very well be entitled to a chargeback. It depends on the specific situation.If you buy from a dealership not an individual you may be protected by the UCC Uniform Commercial Code which requires that goods be fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used. Now you can use a disclaimer to get around that in some states but not all. However even if they do that does not wholly protect them from a chargeback. If as an example they state that there is no warranty but the car is represented to be in good working order and yet the car develops major issues within a month youre perfectly entitled to do a charge back on your credit card.,churning,dbbkelb,1,t5_2vrf0

If you had K SPG points and K UR points the SPG points would be more valuable no matter how you looked at it. The biggest difference IMO is the earning opportunities between SPG and UR.

The bank bonuses were fortuitous timing and further validated my travel.I felt confident that Id get an inbranch approval for the CCs due to the fact that my  is comprised as follows  cards in Jan and the other  cards were in Feb. So I have no apps since February  aside from an inbranch and prequalified Ink that occurred in Aug. My credit score is good ish and my gut tells me Chase really dislikes lots of recent apps in the past  months but they seem to favor good candidates who are modestly over  and who dont have too many apps in the past  months.Edit to add I definitely got the CSR it shows in my Chase online profile but the CSP went to  day pending and while the banker seemed  confident that its normal some redditors have suggested that I will end up denied for CSP. My gut again tells me that I will have the CSP withain a few weeks although it may take a call to the banker and have him help me talk the CC reviewers into approving me.,churning,dch0rl1,2,t5_2vrf0

My questions are as follows I will be looking to purchase my first home within the next year so please try to keep that in mind as it relates to my credit score for any of the questions below Am I even eligible for the Blue Cash Preferred since I already have the Blue Cash? If I am should I go ahead and cancel my Every Day Preferred considering the impact if any to my credit score? If I am not eligible should I go with the Amazon card or something else?  I use my CSR for all things travel and restaurant and my Every Day for pretty much everything else. Is it time to say goodbye to my Starwood card?  Ive already achieved lifetime status with Starwood not to mention the changes to come with the merger.  I dont think theres any reason to keep this but will it have a detrimental effect on my credit score due to the history? Any other thoughts or potential changes I could make?

Go to Flyertalk and the specific Amex forum and theres threads on each airline showing what counts for the credit.  You have to select what airline you want to use the credit for in your Amex profile first.For instance you can purchase a  gift card to various airlines AA Alaska etc and then do another  gift card the next day.

10403325,0,t1_dcn9fia,If it makes you feel better I ran the numbers and the k points youll get on the Preferred k signup bonus and k spend assuming you only spend at the x rate to hit the minimum spend is equivalent to what youd get from the Pluss k signup bonus and only hitting the x category for the minimum spend. So its probably actually less hassle and the different categories doesnt matter if you were only going to get the signup bonus and then stop.From there you can PC the Preferred to the Cash which has all the same categories as the Plus except x on restaurants instead of x on hotels. Except if you have a CSR youre funneling the points onto it doesnt matter because you should be putting hotels and restaurants on the CSR anyhow for the x on dining and travel hotels count as travel and its a wash if you have the CSP for the x on dining and travel. The only remaining difference would be if you were serious about doing MS to max out the k x and k x limits the limit on the Cash for each one is k but even k of MS just on the x is a lot of MS.Personally if I get denied on the Plus Im seriously considering just waiting and apply for the Preferred instead of risking getting grilled by recon. Running the numbers I provided in my first paragraph is actually what made me decide to risk pulling the trigger earlyI probably would have done some light MS on the Plus even after hitting the minimum spend on stuff like Whole Foods gift cards but thats not even really MS...I shop at Whole Foods so itd be more just frontloading my Whole Foods spending but it made me feel a lot better that I was getting k either way and that its not wasting minspendwindow points to just do PNC funding with a Preferred.,churning,dcna8bp,2,t5_2vrf0

YOW or YUL are best for me I know this isnt Churning Canada but it is what it is I am looking for US cards but would tend to fly out of Canada. CDG BOD or LON is useful alternatively hotel rooms across the USALooks like I have a driving trip down the East Coast next month and getting some hotel rooms would be awesome. Thinking about the free Hilton Amex.

10440743,0,t1_dcriujl,gt I will not spend enough to cover the CSR AF.Do you mean that you wont spend enough to get the  travel credit which makes the effective AF ? If not do you fly enough that buying a gift card for  through your preferred airline would be worth it? If not could you take a localish staycation and use the  travel credit toward a hotel within driving distance?Are you close enough to a Chase branch to apply in branch? If so the bonus of k UR versus k UR for the CSP is absolutely worth it unless you legitimately see no way to use the  travel credit. The .cpp value of booking with a CSR through the UR portal versus .cpp with the CSP is also a huge perk. If you really think you cant use the  travel credit for the CSR the CSP is your next best bet especially with the current offer waiving the  annual fee for the first year. Youll need to keep it open to use your UR after the first year as you must have a UR earning card to access the UR portal... but you can always transfer them out to a preferred hotel or airline program to get around that at the expense of sacrificing the flexibility of UR points. ,churning,dcrjaxq,2,t5_2vrf0

Were located in NYC so JFKEWR will work. My original plan was to use my MR to book us two RTs on ANA but with my points frozen and with availability decreasing everyday I doubt I can book in time. Were playing with the idea of transferring UR to United to fly Asiana and ANA but were not sure if we can justify using k UR. Any other cheaper alternatives?And another question. Will AirBNB giftcards count toward the CSR  travel reimbursement or does it have to be an actual booking. My SO and I both have the CSR and we would rather not split our AirBNB reservation in two just to have the travel reimbursement kick in.We haveMe k UR k frozen MR k AA Hoping to save these for our honeymoon k Alaska Also hoping to save for honeymoonHim k UR k AlaskaCrossposted to awardtravel.

If you have found an exception then youve broken the encryption scheme forever because youve successfully performed a collision attack. A more likely  scenario is that the databases are mapped according to name expiration and last  and contain an encrypted entry which is the full credit card number. When a new card that matches the previous name last  and expiration the old card is probably overwritten.,churning,ddil7os,1,t5_2vrf0

10785733,0,t1_ddsah0w,Yeah you can get any combination of the Premier Plus and Business Southwest cards.  If its not that useful that you have a companion pass theres nothing wrong with that.  Its just something to consider nabbing while youre still under .  Honestly the companion pass is icing on the cake even just the normal points can be pretty nice!  Ive done some random trips with friends for birthdays and stuff of that sort though this past year and its been really fun Im single so usually my trips are just friendsmy roommates!  So even if you dont have someone to tag along every time it might be really fun to go places with random friends.  Even using it a few times a year can be really worth it and the value can really add up quick For example a tag along to a Caribbean location can be hundreds saved.  Otherwise as stated above if you dont plan on a lot of cards or a large amount of spend on your cards you really need to pick one transferable program  Chase UR AMEX MR etc. based on the partners youd use as having small amounts of points in multiple currencies is pretty useless.  If you do chose to apply dont forget to use a Reddit referral link if you can!  ,churning,ddsgxl6,2,t5_2vrf0

10977314,0,t1_dec8sj4,A number of ways to go about it they all take some time and manual looking on your own.  You can google Best redemptions for XYZ Point and get some ideas and try to manually recreate.  Whats good about these articles is they will get you thinking about how the partners work because an article explaining how to best use UR MR or TYP will discuss transferring to say Air France and book on Delta or to Aeroplan to book Star Alliance including United.  An article about best use of Avios or transfering to Avios will highlight the ability to book Alaska flights to HI a great option for SEA origin.     I personally pick destinations and work from there researching what options can get you there and which reward porgrams can I actually find award space.  SEA AMS for example you can check a ton of airlines to try and book on Delta Metal Alitalia is one you can find most of this info in a how to use MR guide.  I cant find crap for space on Alitalia some people can.  So I instead chose to book with Air FranceFlying Blue for a few more points.  I can tell you that Asia is a lot easier to get to than Europe from SEA.  TYO is a very easy bizst redemption on ANA and direct plenty of availability.  Both my trips Ive booked to Europe the availability is a huge pain but you can make it work by booking  months out.  Sorry long ramble let me know if more questions.,churning,dec9ce9,2,t5_2vrf0

I mostly use public transport and Im not sure if that would be reimbursed and I never use ubereats cause I walk to every place that I order from.Why you should not begin churningI would like to say one thing that I learnt. People who are here do not pay interest. To me if you are paying interest you are not fit for applying new cards. Also if this card is not up for you and you dont travel or eat outside CSP will not also be right fit for you. See if some other credit cards will be of use to you. If not dont apply for credit cards.If you think savings is the way to go nothing wrong. But as a counter argument you are effectively losing money to those who are reaping rewards.There is another thread on the economics of churning. As much as we are trying to master our finances it is essential to understand how banks make money and also the reward system.I have had similar argument  with a friend who is totally against credit cards.

11471023,0,t1_dfvyu9t,Are you transferring to an airline? If so as soon as you see availability.While cash fares will fluctuate and youll always feel like youre gambling when paying a cash fare Will it go up? Will it go down? most airlines have an award chart  a flight from one region to another is X points regardless of the cash price. If anything is going to happen between now and your date of travel it would likely be a devaluation resulting in award prices going up. So booking now is a safe bet.The one major exception is Southwest  the amount of points required is based off the current cash price of the fare so those do go up and down. The good thing about Southwest is if the price of a flight goes down after booking you can get the difference in points refunded to your SW account. Cant transfer them back to UR but theyll be in your account next time you fly Southwest.Hotels are also usually the same. If its X points today for a room on your dates its likely still going to be X points if you book a week before your travel dates. The variable will be availability not price.Of course everything I just said goes out the window if youre not transferring but instead redeeming URs through the Chase travel portal. Then youre back to consulting the magic  ball of airline fares.,churning,dfw8gt1,1,t5_2vrf0

11597811,0,t3_65ik8d,Going on a little mini vacation that doesnt reap any of the benefits of churning feels weird! Driving up to Boston where my wife will be running the marathon her dream since she started running  years ago and staying at an AirBNB. We opted to drive because I was supposed to play on a hockey tournament next weekend but it ended up being moved anyways. Oh well!This trip has really soured me on AirBNB though. We had to book x because hosts kept canceling which is very frustrating! I just heard from someone I know who is also running and he was woken up by a text saying their place was cancelled  less than  hours from their arrival!Edit Oops I lied. I used my CSR travel credit to book this AirBNB. It slipped my mind because the first place I booked was canceled several weeks after the Chase credit posted but they dont claw back that money. ,churning,dgamcdo,2,t5_2vrf0

Following up on what duffcalifornia said there are times where you will have to eat multiple AFs from multiple cards you have but it is worthwhile due to the rewards you gain at the end. That cost is part of the game yknow?Also I would keep the CSP around after you get the signup bonus as you can generate CSP referral links and post it in one of the referral threads here which then gets picked up by Rankt our subs semiofficial referral site. Each referral you get via your referral link nets you K UR which is worth  effectively covering one years AF.

11778464,0,t1_dfzlsvp,Hey I just called Nelnet to try to pay with my Amex SPG. When asked what type of credit card it was what did you say? Because their options are only Visa or MC. I lied and told the rep Visa and then gave my info but it wasnt working on their end. Amex is only  digits so that may be why but I dont know how to bypass that if their drop down menu only has Visa or MC,churning,dgv4k4l,1,t5_2vrf0
11778831,0,t1_dgv2y9m, The last time this was asked the consensus seemed to be that it would be pretty douche baggy to try...  the waived annual fees are a great deal  no need to bite the hand that feeds us. ,churning,dgv621h,5,t5_2vrf0
11779381,0,t1_dgv621h,Yeah thats why I havent done it or checked in the last four years. I was definitely unhappy that all the people getting Gold Cards ruined Barclaycard for us. Just wondering if anyone actually did it or what Amexs stance on it was. Thanks!,churning,dgv8axq,1,t5_2vrf0
11779461,0,t1_dgv5zt1,Hold out some hope. I got my first offer about a month ago CSP and had gotten the bonus within the last . Checked again today I saw they added the Slate whcih doesnt help me and a  offer on the Freedom! So offers can change and develop over time.,churning,dgv8mor,2,t5_2vrf0
11779798,0,t3_6834vr,Bummer. Only a matter of time. Ill scratch this card off my wish list now. ,churning,dgva07l,14,t5_2vrf0
11782689,0,t1_dgvde06,You can also load the GC with something less than the full  if you want to mix it up.,churning,dgvltor,0,t5_2vrf0
11783366,0,t1_dgvl2w5,Hmmm wonder if it will apply to the business version too. Im still below  so cant do the personal quite yet.,churning,dgvolb2,1,t5_2vrf0
11783677,0,t1_dejg7h6,Im very new to churning and the eventual redemption of my accumulating Chase UR points and I was curious if you could expand on what an extremely cheap economy flight looks like as far as UR value? Like what amount of points would you consider a great deal? k or lessmore? And whats a more medium amount of points for a ticket in your opinion? Talking roundtrip.,churning,dgvpv2p,1,t5_2vrf0

11785237,0,t1_dgvqscd,Dont know if it helps but when I was meeting my IHG spend I messaged them right after a purchase of k in AGCs. They even replied that theyll match it after the k purchase of American Express Gift Cards posts. They definitely know its a GC but dont really care I guess? I got the points too ,churning,dgvw8zx,0,t5_2vrf0

11788473,0,t3_685ekg,I did this the last time there was a  added bonus for transferring SPG to AA.. I have tried to use the AA points I really tried.. I was flexible with airports and dates.. Im still sitting on those miles. I got rid of my Citi AA I keep the Barclay solely for the yearly  bonus and put only one charge per month on the card. Ill churn AA miles but I wont give them any more organic spend or convert points that may actually have a use until they produce some better options for the miles I have piling up.,churning,dgw9h1a,6,t5_2vrf0

11791536,0,t1_dgwehel,The  vouchers the original cost of the ticket come with a  redemption fee each and can only be used for the person originally ticketed  hence why its definitely best to just let them expire and get reimbursed for them.,churning,dgwlzem,2,t5_2vrf0

11796126,0,t1_dgx055g,Id go for  more Chase cards once youre back to  apply for both on the same day ideally.  Probably MPE and one of the SW cards if CIP is off the table.  But only if those cards are appealing to you. Otherwise go for AMEX. AMEX business charge not credit cards are a good bet too because they wont count toward .  So you can do those anytime. ,churning,dgx4q7g,-2,t5_2vrf0
11797112,0,t1_dgx8jxi,I see. Why not just get both or all ? You can just canceldowngrade after a year if you dont want to pay the AF,churning,dgx8r7n,2,t5_2vrf0
11797154,0,t1_dgx8lz0,Nope unfortunately you lose all progress at the end of the year. You keep the points obviously but the progress to k starts again at  on Jan st.Thats why the recommended advice is sign up for the cards and complete minimum spend as early in the year as possible so you can max out the amount of time you have with the companion pass.,churning,dgx8xef,3,t5_2vrf0

11806688,0,t1_dgyagxz,I started out the same way I did with churning by checking out couponing blogs online. There are tons. Some are better than others but most gave all the basics spelled out while a few even have posts specifically for a newbie so you can learn all the inandout. Its much like churning as in each store has their own rules. ,churning,dgybugs,2,t5_2vrf0

11809138,0,t1_dgyldyh,I see that but the cost of the FTF while using those cards in another country to reach minimum spend will still be offset by the bonuses.,churning,dgylusl,0,t5_2vrf0
