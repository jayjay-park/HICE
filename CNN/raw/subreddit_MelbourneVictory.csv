6980406,0,t3_4b72yp,Celeski should be nowhere near our hit list.I think Bozanic stays the rest probably go. Valeri the question mark too.Id like to see us poach good HAL talent. Castro would be a good replacement for Finkler. Rumour that we are looking at Castelen to replace Barbarouses. Would give anything for MDP to go round another year too.,MelbourneVictory,d17kg7z,3,t5_2ut7a
