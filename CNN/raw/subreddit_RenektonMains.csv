8515405,0,t3_4vz69b,I tried it a bit. I wasnt a huge fan because its pretty expensive. You really mow down towers with it though. I dont think TF rush is that good. The components individually aside from Phage feel pretty bleh in lane. You end up spending a lot of gold on components that dont help you that much in the first few levels of laning. GB into TF felt ok when I tried it but I preferred cleaver most of the time. If you are splitpushing against a nontank its pretty nice because you mow down towers with it though.I dont like building TF after BC at all because its so expensive and you were already wasting the mana stat and now youre wasting the Rage passive too. ,RenektonMains,d65zgcg,1,t5_39cxm

9100777,0,t3_54x3ah,Those matchups arent comparitively hard the hardest matchups in the game are Kayle and Teemo not even because of the lane which isnt easy by any means but because in midlategame they can cockblock you super hard teemo with slows and blind Kayle with ult on the squishy you target. People are picking him a lot recently actually since hes a counter to every melee carrybruiser in the game his playrate and winrate are respectable.,RenektonMains,d85rmp4,4,t5_39cxm

9324494,0,t1_d8xqov4,Hmm I think assuming youre rushing an AD item like cleaver tiamat or ghostblade you really should be starting longsword vs darius. Avoid his cheese and stay out of his Q heal and its a renekton sided matchup.,RenektonMains,d8xy5jd,3,t5_39cxm

9896923,0,t3_5h5h8e,Uh.. Ok so first of all I agree. Renekton isnt a good pick. The only thing I can imagine about his winrate is that he is reasonably strong early and good at utilizing advantages power spikes in early teamfightsskirmishes can lock people down to make picks etcAs for the Nasus matchup  Nasus outscales everyone in a v. If he gets a reasonable amount of stacks and FH in any AD matchup hell kick their ass if he hasnt fed or is very far behind in CS.To play the Nasus matchup as Renekton you need to Know wave management very well Have GOOD map awareness because  gank and youre screwedI generally dont like Renekton into Nasus because if the junglers engage in the matchup you can lose your advantage very fast. Enemy jungler pressuring is enough for him to freestack if you fall to a gank he gets a kill at which point your window has probably closed. Since this sub is for Renekton mains I guess you want to pick Renekton into Nasus... So my recommendation is thisYou have two ways of dealing with Nasus run up and hold his lane at lvl  so your wave goes into his side of the map which makes him push faster. This way you get lvl  with the lane around your tower giving you more time to chase him down and damage him making you safe from the lvl  gank. slow push until the wave is approaching his tower if it stops right outside of it just shove it into his tower. At this point he wont have enough CDR to pick up everything in Q stacks so he loses a lot on this. Just back when the wave crashes dont bother stick around trying to harass him way too risky unless you know where enemy jg is. The other way of doing this is pushing first waves into tower and hope he loses as many stacks as possible then from lvl  give him more space and manage the wave so he has to come up in the lane and take them at which point you beat him. Just understand that at one point or another unless you are very fed Nasus will beat you v. Renekton isnt really a duelist Nasus is an incredible duelist. ,RenektonMains,daxlckz,2,t5_39cxm

9977835,0,t3_5ieiyu,I dont get it. All you did was run around the map and pop blasting cones. I dont even see a juke in the whole clip.,RenektonMains,db851n3,3,t5_39cxm
10086732,0,t3_5k9ksq,Its my favorite lane because its entirely dictated by your ability to dodge her Q and E. I always take Ghost in the matchup. I like doing quick trades and positioning myself behind a minion with my E out to negate her followup with E. Even if she hits a Q on you on your way out youll have won the trade. Other than that just dont underestimate her ult and always have a way to disengage it.,RenektonMains,dbmbhu6,1,t5_39cxm
10130371,0,t3_5l08d1,dont trade when shes got her shield. Dont get trapped against walls and dont stand in her Q. I bring ignite vs her for extra kill pressure.,RenektonMains,dbrzqzi,3,t5_39cxm

11262572,0,t3_60qhxv,Honestly Im gonna buy it because its a renekton skin. I have every one ever made yes even rune wars and galactic. I hate that it doesnt have any cool spell animations though. It feels like renekton really got the short end of the stick with the skins that came out with this set in terms of coolness and thought input.,RenektonMains,df8lgr9,3,t5_39cxm

11515590,0,t1_dg0rs0a,Yes If I want to burst while maximizing damage I use E into Q as fast as possible aa and w as soon as aa dmg comes and r as soon as w animation starts. Then you can use aa into tiamat and nd e. If you dont need r replace it with tiamat. Also you can test aawtiamatr.,RenektonMains,dg1akxp,1,t5_39cxm
