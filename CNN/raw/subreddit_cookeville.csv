6360495,0,t1_czboz16,Ive been to the Coliseum several times! My boyfriend plays in the Super Smash Bros. weekly tournament that they host every once in a while. I was also pretty bad at the trivia the one night I went.  I would love to start going again though!Do you andor your husband like to play board games? Weve started getting into modern board games. They are different than the classic games like Monopoly and Scrabble but a ton of fun! Weve been thinking about making a weekly board game night at the Coliseum!I dont work in town I actually work in Nashville which most people think is a crazy commute but Im alright with it. During college I would do all sorts of stuff around town with my buddies. We would go to Cummins Falls or Burgess Falls to chill or make the short drive to Bee Rock or even Center Hill Lake. We also liked playing disc golf at Cane Creek Park.I also LOVE movies and games so I try to invite people over for a hang out as often as I can.Nowadays I mainly just invite people over for games or a movie. Or occasionally go out somewhere for drinks. Things I would like to start doing more are camping going to the lake active things so I can get in better shape day trips to Nashville or somewhere like that etc.Anyway! Yeah let me know if you guys decide to go to Trivia night and maybe we can introduce ourselves.,cookeville,czcm8jz,1,t5_2sa2f
