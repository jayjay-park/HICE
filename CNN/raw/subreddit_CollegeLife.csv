Nuke this for about  seconds on high  watt microwave. Now prepare a box of Jiffy Yellow Cake Mix or any cheap yellow cake mix according to package directions. Add just enough cake batter to fill the mug about  full.  Now comes the surprising finale  nuke the cup for exactly one minute on high. The cake bakes just like it would in an oven rising sufficiently to fill the mug. You now have a freshly baked generous portion of Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Refrigerate the remaining batter for when you want to bake another serving of cake.  ,CollegeLife,chg9f7p,1,t5_2qsii
