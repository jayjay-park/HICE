9387968,0,t3_596hc3,This is not my furniture.  I want to repaint with a warm offwhite color and keep the wood trim as is.  Im a little more uncertain about the kitchen. I want to put a floating butcher block breakfast bar in the kitchen.  What ki d of color would go with the black counters and wood?,interiordecorating,d95zp30,1,t5_2t8dh
9395450,0,t3_596hc3,I really think a leafy olivey green with teal and gold accents would look nice. Adding earthy greens and blues would make all that honey wood look so sunny and cheerful.,interiordecorating,d96xtqd,1,t5_2t8dh
10001925,0,t3_5iu1ow,Have you thought about recovering it in a neutral like a burlap or gray? Find someone in your life that can sew and have a cover amp skirt made for the entire piece amp hide Etsy or local seamstress. Warm up the space with layers. Throw a mirror or a pic collage behind it. Add a chair on one side and making it a readingcraft nook. Or add a runner amp tray layer some candles real or electricsome framed photos. Easy to care for plants like a pony tail palm pothos succulents. Ideally Id put a floor plant on one side. Is this near an entrance? Could pop a coat rack amp some baskets for hats gloves stuffTV stand? Do both of those tables on either side have to be there? ,interiordecorating,dbba2k1,3,t5_2t8dh
10432568,0,t3_5pc33j,What a beautiful room!  I wonder if you could put a bench by the window to give you a window seat.  I love the idea of a small rug.  You might consider some pillows on the chairs.  That could add a pop of color.  Maybe a small table between the chairs.  I dont know what the art work looks like but I agree the frame could use a different color. Spray paint is a cheap fix.  Feel free to play around with the furniture arrangement.  I have been amazed sometimes when I think something wont look great but I try it just to see and it surprisingly works well.  Look at some pictures online to get more ideas.  Looks like you have a great theme started with the chess.  Maybe you could put some giant chess pieces on the shelves.  Just do a google image search for rooms with chess themes. ,interiordecorating,dcqln88,2,t5_2t8dh

10503054,0,t3_5qcrlm,oklove the walls and floor.  IF and only if there is no other spot in the room for the tv be creative and really think about thisthen I agree that the stand needs to b white and as minimal as possibleYou can put the speakers and such in a large dark wicker basket on on side and bring in a tall potted plant think fig tree on the other.  You can leave your hula girl photo there IF you add a matted and framed photo above and below it,interiordecorating,dcyms0f,3,t5_2t8dh
10678501,0,t3_5so5rb,I would probably just treat the space like a rectangle and not consider the nook as part of the livable space. I feel like anything you put in that corner would just block the view and access to your balcony.Maybe set up your couch on the wall across from it and your TV on the wall backing the bedroom so you can see the lake out the nook window.,interiordecorating,ddhen93,2,t5_2t8dh

11517128,0,t3_64eds7,Any comments would be appreciated I got this really nice MidCentury bedroom set but I dont have a lot of space in my master bedroom to place all the pieces. Im thinking about using two chests like this one as nightstands but I fear they might be too big. I have a matching headboard though.    Ive seen in Houzz some images of folks using chests as nightstands but they typically look smaller than this. ,interiordecorating,dg1guvq,2,t5_2t8dh
