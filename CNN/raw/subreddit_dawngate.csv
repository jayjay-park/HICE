3778,0,t3_1u62z7,Started playing Dawngate due to looking for a new game to play after getting bored of WoW and not enjoying LoL lt     Favourite moments are probably playing with close friends Ive made through the dawngate community!    Ive enjoyed all the shapers guild songs and creations as theyre really unique and inspiring.    I hope dawngates player population continues to grow and develop which will lead to a more accurate mmrrated xD    Positive? Went sub seconds on a Pyraminx solve?,dawngate,ceev8z2,4,t5_2x9kd
5012,0,t1_ceezyf5,yes i read that. and it essentially tells me to carry the game. if their solution for the time being is to turn a v teambased game into a individual skill who can carry the hardest game then what kind of matchmaking is that... as i said before. i love the site. i love the game. i love the features that the folks over at dawnscout have created. but the game just isnt ready for a ranking system yet. ,dawngate,cef0aa7,0,t5_2x9kd
40622,0,t3_1ukiwv,So do you even proof read anything or do you just type it up and go with it? The spelling mistakes are real. Ill give you a hint I didnt make it past the third sentence.,dawngate,cej20m4,2,t5_2x9kd
45629,0,t1_cejlmmn,Considering how accurate win rates are in comparison to rating should this even be done? A lot of people lost a lot of rating before the changes to the algorithm hopefully the system will be out for a while before leaderboards sort via rating.,dawngate,cejmjb0,1,t5_2x9kd

61267,0,t1_cel6gxw,loving this idea and its almost in line with my general idea Once you become a shaper you must build an amulet ill call it that for now so that you may further connect with your vitality upon entering the Dawngate. You further that bond the more time you spend in the Dawngate. Loot plays in because sometimes the other base vitalities haste power armor etc all feel more connected to you so they leave you gifts parts of themselves sparks in order to bond with your own vitality even more by finishing your Amulet. It ends up becoming a sort of tuning fork between you and your vitality!,dawngate,celeluk,1,t5_2x9kd

125070,0,t3_1vip32,My best guess is the texture is somehow corrupted. Id try a Validate andor reinstall of the client The gear icon in the top left of the launcher.I dont work in that area of the code so I dont know the details but I do know the one system draws the icons camera rect and the minimap texture so it seems strange to me the one would be off while the others look correct. ,dawngate,ceso9sx,1,t5_2x9kd

145232,0,t3_1vqqvb,I mentioned it in another thread last week but the short answer is that different people work on different things.  If you go back  weeks dodging was not considered a big issue it happened but it was rare enough that very few people were concerned with it.  We start working on features a long time before the community gets to see them in game so before dodging was an issue many people were hard at work implementing Leaderboards.    Work is in progress to improve the dodging situation beyond the Shaper Select change made to not show player names.  Hope that helps!,dawngate,ceuz1cv,6,t5_2x9kd

153326,0,t3_1vuh6k,there is not a hard cap but there are significant diminishing returns. For example if you use the item builder on  and set up an adc with  fates highest haste item you have . attacks per second.It will always have an effect on your AS however the real question is if it would be worth giving up early game power for this late game loadout.,dawngate,cevw8ou,1,t5_2x9kd

189382,0,t3_1w9x7e,Are you joking? the damage output in this game is ridiculously high. It is significantly higher than most other MOBAs and damage dealers late game are much much stronger than tanks melting them almost instantly if you have a good build.If you are not doing a lot of damage you are not playing damage shapers or you are building poorly.

233858,0,t3_1wpocx,Im not sure. When I first started playing it I really enjoyed it. It felt like a breath of fresh air compared to how stagnant League has become in the past year but the more I play the less I like it. I love the music I adore the art I like the Shaper design for the most part but balance wise it feels like a nightmare.Moya changes still feel like they did absolutely fuckall to her Kindra is an utter nightmare Cerulean is like fucking Jarvan and Singed all in one Faris is a horrific pain in the ass etc etc.Then on the other side of things youve got tons of characters who just feel underwhelming. Viyana Nissa Mikella none of them feel like they contribute all that much. Zeri is super fun and does deceptively high damage but she still doesnt feel like as a supportcarry she offers much actual support compared to how insanely stacked this game is with hard CC everyfuckingwhere.Zeri can silence. Meanwhile youve got Shapers with multiple stuns flips complete removal gap closers more stuns snares its ridiculous. I feel like Dawngate suffers from serious power imbalance with few Shapers that feel like theyre middle of the road. But I see not too many balance patches that change much.I love the fact that the game loads instantly I love the fact that this startup can somehow give me lt  ping while the biggest MOBA in the world atm cant somehow do better than a hundred and fucking thirty and I love how much effort is going into the lore and setting. I just think the balance is absolutely atrocious and more needs done about it than is. Oh and fuck the random reward system still.But yeah. My real main complaint is how prevalent hard CC is EVERYWHERE. It makes Shapers without it feel underpowered and out of place. I know Im going to get downvoted to oblivion because everyone seems to think this is the greatest game ever but this is how I feel. Like whoever zones in with the most hard CC is going to win. ,dawngate,cf4zm30,1,t5_2x9kd

Try to upgrade.,dawngate,cf6syk6,3,t5_2x9kd
257843,0,t1_cf7fph6,I did some quick calculations of my own. New Rage only catches up to old Rage when someone has  times as much bonus armorMR as base armorMR. For tanks thats . bonus armor and  bonus MR at level . That means somewhere around  tier resist items.Now compared to Destruction assuming it hasnt been changed new Rage gives more penetration once someone has  bonus armor or MR which is only  or  items. Obviously this isnt taking into account the fact Destruction gives almost twice as much power.,dawngate,cf7hctg,1,t5_2x9kd
261452,0,t1_cf7u9tj,The thing about Faris is that you want to be jumping in and nabbing low health targets. Chunking people down in lane with a max W is the safest and most reliable way to get people into the kill zone. Getting to the same point with a q max requires a lot more auto attacks which requires you to walk up to auto them and aggros minions to you. Maxing q also gives you a lot less burst when you do decide to go for a kill. ,dawngate,cf7ux1h,2,t5_2x9kd

292229,0,t1_cfaze6z,I meant dont overdue it more aimed at the thread in general. I actually like some of the lore ideas. For examplegtSpells  Ah sorcery my favorite element of Fantasy. Spells are clearly a kind of sorcery again NOTHING was said on the spells. Does being close to the Dawngate allows Shapers to shape vim into spells but how do they use it and chose them? How do they know Well its time to blink. Need more spells lore maybe those are some kind of physical marks maybe those are some ancient words.Im all for giving a lore explanation for things as long as the regular nomenclature and accessibility is simple. I think renaming things for the sake of uniqueness is bad design. Its essentially trumpeting look how clever and unique our game is we have fancy words for everything!

487964,0,t1_cfvmizs,Your treating the game like its not in beta at all and has million concurrent users.The game is playable sure but its not finished in Waystones eyes by a mile and your defending littering their servers with bullshit accounts that could be space used for real people.How dare you speak from nobility even after youve been on their podcast and they even spoke about smurfing and wanting something to circumvent it but they are busy designing and fleshing out other parts of the game that are higher on their agenda.The point of the beta is not to have a main or get attached because things change drastically all the time. Your single account was chosen for you to provide data and feedback but instead here you are creating multiple accounts. I guess their account creation process works flawlessly amirite?Imagine if the multiuse code TwitchDG didnt exist and you had to get a key everytime you smurfed. The game would never grow because there is no way for anyone else to get access in that retrospec.The entire League of Legends community and the way it continues to build stigmas and metas are whats wrong with ARTS. Thats where the Toxic bs comes from the meta the talk everything other games want to not be and they flood other games and infect their communities with the same like minded bullshit.Every game of Dawngate where I see people use Lingo from League it always ends up with people flaming or wanting to surrender to yelling at either lane because they arent up to their standards.Just because you may have been in high elo once upon a time in League doesnt mean shit in any other game.It makes you by no way an Authority to go by. League is easier than most ARTS out their as well. Lets see you take on HoN as terrible as their community maybe or Dota if you want learning curve.Smurfs make it more viable because you bring your own skill level down when trying new things to match those that you are playing with Complete False. You still know items and mechanics and generals plays and ideas. All your doing is reading the characters abilities and working them in real situations which can be done on any account smurf or not.

679209,0,t1_cggw7e0,They should steal the souls of the dead workers which ether spawn an extra worker at one of their spirit wells for a set period or gives them a buff that continues them getting VIM over a long period of time. So there is more objective to do actually harass the spirit well. Ether that or the opposite. The spirit well gets semi locked and you cant spawn worker for say  second after a predator kill something at the well. I think predator should be about roaming and controlling the opponents objective. Like for instance maybe if they attack a buff minion the buff is locked for  seconds so the enemy team does it get it if they kill the minion. Or maybe even  strike steal the buff for a smaller period of time so they can use it in lane.Maybe it could be like Tactician but its more Vim over a longer period of time for doing a set amount of damage. So youd get more Vim if you just constantly harassed in lane with Tactician but youd be able to roam between lanes more often.,dawngate,cghh61p,1,t5_2x9kd

734396,0,t3_22kbz4,Secretony I never for a second meant that sparks and spirit stones should be purchasable with real money however I completely and respectfully disagree with your evaluation.This is an issue that people have complained at Riot about for a VERY long time  something that effects your in game stats should NOT be so difficult to gain access to. You say that the game could be arguably seen as pay to win but with the extremely high costs that sparks and spirit stones have right now the game could be seen as PLAY to win  that is people that have had more time invested into the game and therefore more destiny with which to build their loadouts will have a significant advantage over newer players who havent had a chance to build their loadouts yet.Dawngate circumvents this problem slightly by providing all players with a basic if somewhat mediocre loadout that they can use until they can purchase spirit stones and sparks but that doesnt change the fact that a tank using the default loadout is at an inherent disadvantage against a tank that is using a warden   brawler loadout or that most nonauto attack based junglers are at a serious disadvantage until they get the destiny to purchase all of the pieces for their loadouts.Honestly I would actually prefer that they set the cost of new pages REALLY high but only provide access to one or two pages for free and have the cost of spirit stones and sparks be fairly low even somewhere around the price point they were using previously would probably work. That way people would have the chance to quickly purchase the pieces for their loadouts but if they wanted to have a number of unique loadouts at once they would have to grind destiny or pay up front for them.Also Im ok with a price increase on shapers  I really am but I dont think that jacking the price of all of them as far up as they did is the right answer. Even in League Riot has had very low IP cost champions since release I have no idea if they were  in beta as well as I wasnt playing then since they realized that people especially new players are going to want to be able to have some amount of consistency fairly quickly.And that I think is where my issue really comes in Fine those of us that were playing previously got a free  destiny that we could spend on a couple of shapers or a loadout page but what about the people that start afterwards? Theyre going to see those high price points and wonder if its really worth investing all that time into the game.TLDR I have  problem with the monetization model simply a small issue with the pricing choices. Over all Im super excited to buy things that I think are worth it Skin prices are perfect and Im excited for more announcer packs! but that doesnt mean that those of us that think that things are slightly over priced shouldnt say anything about it.,dawngate,cgnr6it,10,t5_2x9kd

739260,0,t3_22mpbj,I like Icons.  Theyre clearly going to offer some ward skins as well.However Im also afraid if they do name color changes and if theyre too obvious and flashy well just have another system of LoLs Border Syndrome  Where people judge each other based upon the pregame loading screen because of their rewards from previous time played.  I think profile icons based upon number of games played in Beta tier system is a good reward.  Not skill level or ranking but just number. People who finish on the saltyboards by the time they do the end of Beta wipe or whatever should probably get another one but that would be the exception.Boosts and advanced access to things are less of rewards to be proud of and seem more competitiveadvantagey if not a bit of the natural sour grapes people have to those that seemingly show up late to the party.Tldr  I like icons I do not like boostsearly access name colors could be cool but I dont like LoL Border Syndrome from load screens.  ,dawngate,cgob3qr,3,t5_2x9kd
741960,0,t3_22nbpk,I actually rather like the over all idea of this rework. There are a few things Im a little confused about or believe that people would be confused by based on wording. Im personally confused what this meansgtThe damageovertime is only  as effective with Duskmantles cooldown reduction.and I could see some confusion arise from some of the less readable empowered effects like shadow razes blinking to the projectile also would that make the projectile just poof? or nightstrikes blades all damaging a target but only in empowered mode.The one big thing that I would say is a big nono is having the max rank of nightstrike be that low of cooldown. In theory BEFORE any cooldown reduction if you land your q and w on the entire enemy team you can reduce the cooldown to just  second. Add in the possibility of cooldown reduction and it could theoretically be up before you even finish casting it.While thats clearly a situation where the enemy team was way too grouped up against her it just shouldnt be able to happen.Also one of the bigger issues that I have with her kit as it stands right now yours still kind of has this issue but to a much lesser extent since her w just gives her damage in an AoE instead of rewarding her with an enormous shield is how hard it is for newer players to understand how to react to her. Even once you understand how it works her kit still causes the enemy team to use counter intuitive counter play to deal with her.Her Q and W encourage everyone on your team to split up since if you all stick close together itll just lead to her being nigh impossible to kill from her heals and shields thats assuming she gets a reset of course but her ultimate encourages the exact opposite If youre split up and she ults the carry the carry is taking ENORMOUS damage from her ult.  On another note they need to change the skill shot indicator on her Q  its shown as a straight line despite working as a cone.,dawngate,cgom6lb,3,t5_2x9kd

I never actually afk and have actually started trying not to say this because Ill have team mates freak out about it. On league people say it legitimately as like well I screwed up and in a joking manner and on this game I guess people take it seriously. Something else that people overlook is that you can always improve even the best players in the world and players in tournaments if you think they go home and say well you know I could just start a new game but this one is pretty good Ill stick with it youre crazy. The professional players play like  hours a day and always try to improve if nothing more than a new experience or following what other players are doing. No matter what you can always improve so instead of trying to say that other people are terrible just look at your play because unless you have a flawless score no deaths full kill participation and were a member of every team fight then you can look at something you can improve from that game. Thats why I said you learn more from losing because you made more mistakes in the games that you did bad and can look at how to do better next time.,dawngate,cgqotsd,2,t5_2x9kd

799175,0,t3_23aexe, The past week their small development team has been preparing for and has been at PAX East. Thats a significant chunk of time.   The CONSTANTLY in this subreddit. They are constantly in various twitch streams. Ive talked to a few numerous times about balance issue suggested features etc and Im not even a big deal. This is one of the best companies out there about listening to the players.   Really? Youre devolving to insulting the development team? Do you think you can do better?   You didnt mention this in the OP but in one of the comments. That some items give everything so theres no sacrificing stats. As someone who has done significant statistical analysis of the items I can tell you that you are plain wrong. Yes there are items that give  stats but they do so at a significantly reduced capacity. Some of the multistat items are quite inefficient and only work very late game on certain shapers and builds.   ADCs should not v Bruisers. Thats a design fact. Their job is to be able to dive through an entire team to get on you and disrupt you and if they are ahead kill you. All of a sudden you remove the rest of your team and expect to fair any better? Many people will agree that Salous is a little strong right now but the only times I have ever seen him do anything unreasonable is when he is significantly ahead. My point is dont try and v him. On the v subject it depends entirely on your build. There are ADC builds that are meant for vs and builds that are meant for teamfights. Same thing with bruisers. Did you build to shred an entire team? Did he build to burst out one player? Did he build armorhealth specifically against you? You cant look at this is a bubble and say that you should always be able to v a bruiser when youre even thats a unreasonable statement thats missing a lot of crucial information.,dawngate,cgv4aov,3,t5_2x9kd

Of course being a Blizzard game just naturally gives you a giant head start. Also the way they did the beta even if people like me were pissed they didnt get a head start just made those that didnt get in the closed beta want to play it more. Old marketing strategy.

I killed the Petrus early in his jungle and he quit after I secured my second kill down bot.  After inquiring whether he had left without saying anything I told my team I would AFK and make it an even v and they were okay with it.  Granted we lost the game after that because of Dougs sweet King plays I think the game was better overall because of the even playing field.I stayed around in the base and pinged some things for my team to do trying to help them out but we were out matched!  It was still a very good game between the teams! The way I see it either I stay and the enemy team has a terrible time in a v or I idle and at least they have a chance.

1006386,0,t1_chiodx4,It absolutely shouldnt. There should never be any kind of reward or punishment system in a MOBA that changes the way people play the game even for a split second.Maybe your team isnt doing all that well but you as an individual did alright in your lane. Rather than actually try to fight comeback and win there WILL be players who would rather preserve their KDA keep farming and padding their numbers in the hopes of maybe getting Grand instead of Common or Astral instead of Grand.You can reward things like Play  consecutive games without leaving and get a small bonus to your roll but you should never reward someone for their performance in the game.,dawngate,chiomom,0,t5_2x9kd
1007955,0,t3_25mfip,I tend to like shapers that offer major harass options early as those can really set the flow of the game.

In fact it seems pretty intuitive to me having played a couple games against Nissa and seeing the squirrel hotwheeling it across the map let me know roughly the direction she was in. Therefore I know that when Im playing Nissa I should be conscious of my squirrel and what hes up to as he can reveal my position.Maybe Im wrong could you explain why you think its counter intuitive?If its because most people associate bush with safe recall then perhaps they need to reconsider what safe is. ,dawngate,chlmrey,1,t5_2x9kd

1037297,0,t3_25czsb,how i got into this game was pretty simple. I got entirely bored of League of Legends. I was in gold  and simply dropped to gold  in a matter of days. Way too much toxicity and bad mannered people there. I was cruising through origins and i saw Dawngate. I played Smite and Dota and didnt get into it. I was hesitant at first but then thought might as well give it a shot. downloaded the game and first had no clue. Could not find a bots game or even a normal. None of my friends play this game so i jumped into Solo que. I played Jungle Voluc my first game and it was exhilarating. Need to say it was by far the best experience i have ever played on a MOBA. LoL was not even close. In the three beginner games i played with Voluc I stole the para every single time! this caused us to win a few games! After my first wingame i got the rolling system and went to the highest one! I got the free champ raina and loved the reward system. The shaper I want the most is moya as the character looks awesome and the play style is sick.This is my experience with My first game and how i got into Dawngate hope you liked reading through this wall of text! ,dawngate,chm720z,0,t5_2x9kd

Id rather they reduce the range of that but give her some actual armor so she has a little more of an ability to survive. She doesnt want to be in close fights she wants to get out she doesnt have armor which the above may actually let her stay in a team fight a little bit longer and stick with her team. ,dawngate,chrp0l1,0,t5_2x9kd

1133134,0,t3_273nvq, Might edit more if Ill remember something. Feel free to ask for more if you want.Heyo so as you know LoL and Dawngate are more similar to each other than Dota and Dawngate.Lets start with the basic No turn speed all characters turn in the same speed. No Denying. There is no hidden shops and runes. You dont have to kill creeps to earn gold. No stash.The more complex stuff There is a height factor here but its not related to vision. There isnt a high and low ground here. The height here is referred as zaxis and its the position of the character on the zaxisthe d axis the position of the character on the axis. Some abilities are at ground level and cant hit people who are in the air. The shop works differently. There are no component items that build others. In Dawngate you get one basic item and you upgrade it till you reach a final tier. Most characters dont have a resource. Characters are based on an archetype. This system dictates how those characters scale from item stats.  Stats are also different    . Power  Auto Attacks and abilities scale of this stat  . Haste  Attack SpeedMovement SpeedCooldown Reduction scale from this stat  . Armor  Mitigation from physical damage  . Magic Resist  Mitigation from magical damage  . Mastery  Crit rate and spell overload. Crit rate gives a chance to deal double damage on auto attack and spell overload deals extra  damage of the abilitys damage. The creature who is similar to Roshan is called Parasite. He doesnt drop items like Aegis or Cheese. He has  evolutions. Evolution spawn is at  minutes. Evolution  is at  minutes. Evolution  is at . Parasite can not evolve mid fight. On Evolution  and Evolution  the parasite grants a buff.  Role system. This system affects how you earn vimgold. There are  roles.  . Gladiator  Killing creeps grants extra gold  . Tactician  Grants extra gold when harassing enemies. Also grants gold when you stay near a dead creep.  . Hunter  Grants extra gold when killing jungle creeps. Heals when you kill a jungle creep. Random chance to give extra gold when you use a vanquish role.  . Predator  Grants extra EXPGold when you killassist enemies. Spell system.  There are no active abilities on items. Everything moved to to the spell systems. You get  spells.  spell at level   spell at level  and last spell at level . You can sell spells ay your base. Spirit Wells. Its a mechanic similar to RTS games. There are  wells. Each minute a worker spawnsup to  workers. Each team starts with  wells and it unlocks at  minutes. Each worker generates one gold per minute per person.,dawngate,chx35ad,5,t5_2x9kd

1161491,0,t3_27ff4m,Yes the monetization system is extremely similar to LoL the person who invented it works for Waystone now I think but you can earn Shapers aka Champions in endgame loot rolls after each game if youre lucky enough. You can purchase skins announcer packs and ward skins for cosmetics. There are no activateable items however you get  spells similar to Summoner spells but you choose them ingame at levels   and  level cap this allows you to choose them along with how the game is going and you can even switch them out with  Vim aka Gold. There is a runelike system except its useful the moment you start unlike wait until Tier only runes. There is no minion denial like Dota but you can harass enemy economy in the form of Spirit Wells which you can harass or capture. A big thing to know that many Shapers do not have a resource that binds them besides cooldowns. Two lane map dont have more than  gladiators on  team blah blah theres a lot more.

1204583,0,t3_27wbw0,Dont overlook a seemingly simple change from a  lane map to a  lane map with more jungle space.  This change alone has contributed to the current meta being more flexible than what Riot is basically stuck with.  They would have to rework their entire map layout at this point in order to make a dent in their very strict meta and then rebalance every champ in the game ESPECIALLY those more recent champs that they have just been shoehorning into said meta.Riot designs their game around the existing meta right now instead of making efforts to change it beyond nerfing one champ and buffing another.  Waystone is making specific design choices to ensure that they dont go down that same road.  Maybe they fail at it after  champs are released idk.  But right now theyre on the right track.  Mina alone screws with the entire way top players were building their team comps and more unique characters are on the way.,dawngate,ci54tln,1,t5_2x9kd

She takes damage in her host so its double effective when you harass her plus her host. It may be deterring when you see that minashield on the carry but she will still take damage!

Right now youd just use all  points as single points to ban out specific roles for Shapers.  So it depends on how the game balance shakes up with a larger cast.Personally Id prefer DotA style but less bans until we get a large enough roster.  Just one ban at a time.  Once the roster approaches DotA or even LoL size we can start adding bans.  Even for people that play a lot as I do it takes a while to earn idk lets say  Shapers total if its  bans  if theres DotA style  bans.  Thats still a grind atm even with the occasional free Shaper from Divine.  Maybe crafting currency will fix that maybe it wont.

1385423,0,t1_cipxkrm,Thats the wrong way to look at it. The biggest threat you have as an adc is bruisers diving you and what you need is either damage or utility to deal with them.  Inevitably you will need both but theres no item that gives more damage than Rage so long as the enemy has at least  bonus armor.mathsAssumption you can do the maths based on formulas from wiki  power   def pen for adcRage gives Passive    P   DP  P  Destruction gives  P   DP  Judgement gives Passive    P   DP  P  In other words for Rage to be better than Destruction the passive needs to be worth at least  points   x .   bonus armor needed. For Rage vs Judgement assume a lvl Kahgen with default loadout Adamance Resolve and Equilibrium he has  Armor  bonus. In that case P   x .   points for the sake of argument Im not going to count the downside of having to actually get all stacks up. P   x .   points. In that case P is . points better than P which means that actually for rage to be equivalent to judgement damage wise you only need to face someone that has  bonus armor.Of course there are other considerations to be taken into account such as the extra hp judgement being a debuff etc. but from a pure damage standpoint rage is the best and it only gets better as the game goes on which it inevitably does in most pubs.,dawngate,cipy1g9,1,t5_2x9kd

1441615,0,t1_ciwqt0l,My point is that the post presented itself as an analysis of the current state of Basko then didnt do a very academically rigorous job of analyzing that state and it deserves to be heavily criticized for the oversight. Namely it overrepresents his mobility which is something that he has a lot of but he only has an overwhelming amount of it when hes within  range of an opponent and can stay that close. His only substantial nonult gapcloser is the second cast of an ability so he cant jump on you without you knowing that its coming unless he jumps over a wall. Basko is heavily abusive against less mobile squishies but if Im playing Moya or Varion or King of Masks I can absolutely juke his stuff and avoid most of his damage when Im playing better than the Basko player.Saying oh he has four dashes and one has a threesecond cooldown while absolutely true is also absolutely misleading and the only purpose to presenting such a limited view of his kit is to bias readers in favor of the authors position without having to put forth the effort of actually providing solid evidence.,dawngate,ciwzdus,1,t5_2x9kd

How many games have you played?The issue with Dawngate currently for new players is because people from other games are trying this one they dont care about player experience. Its a new game they may or may not like especially when they dont they troll rage afk leave etc. and dont care because odds are they wont play again.

1535442,0,t3_2btecx,People just dont know how to play from behind.Its funny this thread is here because Ive just come from a game that was perfectly winnable but people just kept running into the lanes or the jungle for no reason and dying. When youre losing you turtle. You stay in base ward the surrounding area and let things come to you. With bindings and the guardian you have a much greater chance of winning a teamfight that would have otherwise been lost out in the open.Sadly my teammates wouldnt see the benefit of doing this went out and got massacred. Then I get reported for being toxic and no karma. Its sorta sad to see games thrown away because people dont understand that creeps march towards you in base and overvalue wells at the  minute mark and die trying to take them.You should count yourself lucky youre in diamond.

1540383,0,t1_cj99f5y,Ah my bad wanted to say Smite fixed it now. Strife I feel is pretty much bottom tier it really has nothing good in its favor except a couple characters I like. Their crafting system is an annoying unfair clusterfuck I heard its getting fixed though and its not even a good contender for the casual entry in the genre because HotS pulls it out better and at least has some interesting mechanics like the talent system and unique maps.As for League not being there its because Riots massive lack of professionality all over. They rejected several features for years and only added them when the competition Dota  did their art style is a mess spanning  different iterations of the map and several champion reworks towards each iteration never really completely reworking the game to the same stage fully. Its like they dont even know what game they want to make and change their mind every couple of years never finishing the reworks  before moving on to the next one leaving stuff haphazardly around. And not sure hows League right now in the beta server but theres at least  unfulfilled promises that have been hanging since the dawn of time. Replays new client new engine that doesnt suck ass Sion rework and many more that were already either denied or replaced by an inferior choice such as the amazing magma chamber being stripped down to a dumbass mid v map. A few years ago Id have said League was the best it was cohesive had good lore and design but right now its just a frankenstein monster not even Riot can control and thats why its not my top  its probably th or th if only because of nostalgia from when it was great.,dawngate,cj9d0rb,1,t5_2x9kd

When we deviate from a good match and can ALSO not balance we would just throw that match out and wait for something better.In the meantime I am ratcheting up our definition of good in tuning as our numbers grow.

1548484,0,t1_cjad4hz,Some of the coolest mechanics in both Dawngate and LoL are passives tied to resources. One of the things that drew me to this game initially was that everybody who had a resource was designed in the same vein as Rumble Renekton or Ryze. I generally prefer resourcelimited characters to resourceless characters but when its just a limiter on what you can do and doesnt have any gameplay implications its kind of boring. When your resource limits what you can do sometimes but also rewards playing in a certain way then you have a tangible reward for skilled play and its inherently more fun.,dawngate,cjadjkx,4,t5_2x9kd

1556592,0,t1_cjbc29r,Were in a beta where massive changes are made somewhat regularly so balance arguments are missing the point of topics like this. If we made one large change to all the spells would they be unbalanced? Probably yes but thats not the point. The point is to identify gameplay.It doesnt matter if Blink Dagger is an item. It doesnt matter if its using a slot. It doesnt matter if you get a spell at level . What matter in the context of my post you quoted is the gameplay implications of being able to use once per  minutes versus being able to use multiple times in a fight. The point I was trying to make was being able to use multiple times in a fight is a stronger decision. The spell system is very much like LoLs to boot and compared to the item system in DawnGate the DawnGate spells feel really tacked on.The spell system in DawnGate is its least notable feature it pales in comparison to other features DawnGate has to offer. Literally the fact that everyone has a ward is a much stronger decision than to add the spells. What OP and myself are saying is the system could be better.

EG Phantom lancer gets . agility per level one of the most expensive items in the game and the biggest agility item you can buy is the butterfly and it only has  agility on it. When theres  levels you can see that getting over  agility based off levelling up is pretty massive. To balance things out melee heroes in general have better stat growth than ranged heroes. In addition you gain  skill point for each level but with only  primary abilities  levels and an ult  levels you see theres alot left over.

1753499,0,t3_2ejs7r,I think a more objective based role that focuses on bindings and such is a good idea but Id make some adjustments.. The extra ward would be crazy in games. Have  defenders instead of  tacts in lane and you shut down ganks a LOT easier just because of extra vision. . I think you would need to make something more active about it. Every role that exists encourages you to make a play against the enemy somehow. Actively kill minions for extra gold harass kills or jungle camps. They want you to move against the enemy. This would kind of make turtleing a viable tactic which just slows down already long games. Something that maybe gave them an extra boost to vim when theyre nearby to destroy an enemy binding or vim when you take the guardian cores would probably be a little nicer than just defending YOUR binding. Maybe give them extra vim when a binding kills minions or you get a kill with the bindings assistance so you can still hug yours once in a while but it wants you to take others bindings as well. idk. ,dawngate,ck06q4p,2,t5_2x9kd

I loved Dawngates items at a certain stage where no matter what I would never go two games in a row with the same build Unless playing against the same team of shapers potentially and even then most of the times it will be different because of different game pacing and players.I think it does mitigate the snowball to a small extent but I dont think its moving away from that core issue.I wish I had a solution to propose at this stage but I struggle when I look at what the progression system is atm.  Considering I was one of a lucky few who got to play it.,dawngate,ck130q8,2,t5_2x9kd
1764596,0,t1_ck1ko5a,Well have to agree to disagree then. Nothing about the turn rates ever felt out of place or awkward for me. They were just a feature of the game like six damage types or three attributes or mana.If anything being able to turn on a dime in DG felt weird when I first started playing.Different strokes for different folks I guess.,dawngate,ck1l0ux,1,t5_2x9kd

They trilaned viyanavexKoM and got stomped by ZalgusViridian due to Viyana feeding earlyevident by her being lv  and having  deaths which indicates she fed  deaths then went AFK.,dawngate,ck36jzv,1,t5_2x9kd

1824866,0,t3_2fgpvi,Dota is a very special beast and its economics are drastically different for  reasons.A Steam is essentially a massive acquisition network for Valve games.  No seriously someone put together the stats a few months ago and the vast majority of all money and time spent on Steam are spent on Dota TF and CSGO  All those  off Steam sales are largely for leveraging other devs titles to get people on to Steam any money that rd parties make is a bonus. So theres a much larger pipeline of people trying Dota.B The majority of the money from Dota is made by monetizing players time either by playing the game and getting items to trade or by having players make content themselves and taking a cut.  Which means Dota can have a much smaller Dev team for the amount of content they have to sell.  So the cost base is much smaller.Neither of those apply to Waystone.  At this stage in the lifecycle beta a  full version would cannibalize a lot more high spenders than it would convert nonpaying players.  Itd be a quick way to make Dawngate even less attractive for EA to continue bankrolling by removing any long tail of revenue from the game.,dawngate,ck934ig,7,t5_2x9kd

2075047,0,t1_cl3dclt,Understood but now a huge amount of her kit is reliant on putting skill points in one particular ability.  The rest is damage with one hard and one soft cc.I know its a lot of damage and a lot of slowing and a wellsized stun.  But it seems strange for a single skill point allocated in W to have such a profound impact.  She gains power improvement to her Q and her Ws active ability becomes more useful.  As a general thing only the active most abilities in the game OR the passive improves Varions Sight Zeris Faceeater Nissas movespeed roid.  Sakari already had a particularly influential W because it raised both a passive and a separate skill now it makes the active more powerful on top of that.  This seems to break the paradigm previously set by other shapers hence my concern.  It appears that a lot of people misunderstood me.  or who aggressively disagree that this paradigm shift is significant because Sakari trends towards maxing E first.  But thats meta.  We shouldnt make balance decisions based off a flexible meta.  Im sure there will be competitive teams who consider extra power icebergs and faster Q reload to be more important than a strong burst on their tact that is only effective if they land several successive hits.On that note in reply to strawberrycocoa I wasnt in any way referring to her lategame balance.  Im well aware that she always ended up with .  But scaling is important either way.  Would you grab a damaging ability early on if it scaled ?  Perhaps but chances are youre sacrificing earlygame dps for midgame something not viable on tacticians who need to harass glads who need help last hitting or predators at all.  Im sure you understand lategame balance isnt the only factor that applies when creating a moba character.  The amount of strength they gain per level is arguably more important since that defines the majority of the playtime.,dawngate,cl3l0wx,1,t5_2x9kd

2086327,0,t3_2is5kv,Its not the same system. The two are designed very differently. They have the same stated goals to allow outofgame customization according to what the player wants to get out of their character but Dawngate has fixed most of Leagues problems with implementation mostly due to coming later and observing how and why the rune system failed.. Pure stats. When a customization system only gives you numbers theres going to be a definitively best set of numbers for each individual character. The passive stones mix this up because they provide benefits more powerful than stats but are playstyle or situationdependent. If youre running Brawler but never diving into the enemy team youre not getting your loadouts worth. If youre running Ravager you dont want to dive into a fight immediately but you want to poke first.. Stat segregation. Leagues different categories of runes are a big problem. While theyre intended to make overspecialization suffer in efficiency just like the samecolor spiritstones what they do in practice is make you not have to make any tradeoffs. In Dawngate if you want an offensive loadout youre going to have to give up some of your Armor or Health in order to do that.. The pieces. Every nonQuintessence fits in the same slot size. Every Quintessence is interchangeable. The differing sizes and shapes of spiritstones allow for finer tuning of what they give you. A lot of them are very strong but they also take up a lot of the loadout andor have funny shapes that you have to work around.. The grind. You get a loadout for free as well as the materials to make a second one and pieces drop as you play the game. See above for why the loadout system is less restrictive than the rune system and those first two loadouts are pretty good in spite of not being specialized the starting loadout gives you a boatload of stats.,dawngate,cl50npu,2,t5_2x9kd

2104416,0,t3_2j0z1g,Viyana and Renzo are both fantastic picks on teams where you have coordination but rather less fantastic picks in solo queue still very solid options but they both require lots of communication to get the most out of them. Plus honestly if you dont like Raina I dont think youll like Renzo all that much better. You want to be in the middle of the fight setting up your empowered abilities and soaking damage for your carries when you play him usually.Asha and Sakari are both incredibly powerful poke mages that are usually played as tacts. Sakari in particular still synergizes well with duress which even after its nerfs is an incredibly powerful item on the right shapers. Sakari is one of those right shapers.Basically if you enjoy back line andor strong harass Id suggest ashabel and sakari out of the list you provided. I would also add Tess who can be a great tact because of her roaming strength and ability to provide your team with a support that can transition to a carry if shes doing well enough and KoM sort of short range but incredibly good at setting up kills thanks to his  different CCs and great at getting out of fights that he doesnt want to be in thanks to his dashgtccgtdash,dawngate,cl7bf0o,3,t5_2x9kd

2179111,0,t3_2jzqwk,Shes definitely easy to kill. Ive only played one game with her but I had a hard time even getting my ult off. Her q is hard to get off as well because of its shorter range. I think she just needs to focus the closest enemy to her since she has so much magic pen. Its a weird concept because everyone is so used to focusing the squishy champs. Her rang is fairly short though so she needs to position very well and just blow up whoever is closest or is diving on to her. Just my first impression with her so far. ,dawngate,clgtgg6,1,t5_2x9kd

2181032,0,t3_2k1g01,They ruined him as his archtype was Ability Based Bruiser. With the nerfs to his ENTIRE kit his signature Burst is gone to the point of just simple utility to give him uptime for him to Auto.This is further helped by his new passive. Salous never had problems with uptime however he wasnt about auto attacking in the past. Now he needs more uptime to even be relevant making his passive actually good in terms of need.His Q Change was pointless. His W change is understandable but I feel like a hit to Forms passive would have been better. His E change was so pointless and was just a kick to his already terrible late game. Salous is meant to be a high risk high reward shaper. Thats the whole point of burst kits. If we were speaking in terms of something like a Mage Zalgus he would be next to unplayable atm. The reason Zalgus isnt is due to the fact that he is ranged. Allowing him to build glass cannon and get away with it. A bruiser being the second part of Salous Archtype requires him to build some what tanky so he doesnt just trade  for  which is the job of an Assassin. This makes his damage fall off late where someone like Zalgus continues to be a relevant burst damage dealer.Right now best way to play Salous is some what of an OnhitAuto based playstyle. I dislike this because I fell in love with the Ability based Salous of old. I just hope they buff him next patch he fell from SA Tier to BC Tier.,dawngate,clh28sa,0,t5_2x9kd

If they had given them until february they would have been able to see if the actual game was going to get them the numbers they wanted. The issue that youre missing is that this IS beta. beta is not where you judge a games effectiveness. you judge it once its been released. Beta is where the game grows not the community. And clearly youre not aware of how long other games are in alphabeta stages. This is a drop in teh bucket.  EA killed a baby slight overexaggeration   but you get what i mean. it wasnt even done developing before they judged its effectiveness in entering and competing in the moba world. they didnt even offer up enough advertising to get it out there. ,dawngate,cltv66c,2,t5_2x9kd

2293169,0,t1_clv4jx9,More popular alternatives for sure if you expect any game to be more popular than LoL or Dota with  advertisement and while being in beta then keep waiting it wont ever happen it doesnt matter how good the game is. Now better? You know thats subjective right? Even Riot employees are saying Dawngate was the best alternative to LoL. Most people that played the game loved it and the population was much bigger than games like Strife or Infinite Crisis.But most people wont stay around in a game in beta precisely because shit like this can happen. That and no fucking full time EU servers.Also MOBAs dont take that much money to make and mantain specially when you dont even invest in proper EU servers and have thousands of people waiting to play until you have them at least in comparison with most genres there are MOBAs out there with  times less players than Dawngate doing just fine.EA just wants top sellers they expected Dawngate to miraculously get millions of players without even putting the required investment to do so theyve done the same with so many games at this point that I dont know why its even a surprise.

The decision to make all shapers freetoplay once Progression launched illustrates that the currency grind just to unlock new toys to play with was a major turnoff for a lot of people.As consumers I dont think it would have killed us to loosen up our coinpurses a little tiny bit. An FP can live or die based on how successfully it monetizes cosmetic items. Maybe if you like the game and are enjoying the experience chip in  for a ward skin. Yes you will have some points left over yes it may annoy you slightly to see unuseable points sitting in your account but developers need to eat too. That  is more than just grabbing a cosmetic item for yourself its a substantive practical support for the people working to give you the product youre enjoying. You dont need to do it every paycheck or a nything crazy like that just put something in the tip jar once in awhile grab something fun to use ingame and give something back to the developers.

Please dont forget this and preorder it because Star Wars.Aside from that the developers themselves are making the games theyre just being forced into corporate bullshit by EA and being made to stand in public view to take the blame.

3777070,0,t3_33mhbx,I really liked dawngates item system I played Mina Raina and Dese almost exclusively after trying out most of the shapers who had kits that looked interesting to me but I had  distinct play styles with Mina sadly only  workable with Raina  but  workable Dese styles that were possible because items werent restricted to AD or AP  builds. Items not being locked into only being suitable for certain shapers because you werent only getting an item for half of what it did was what made it possible to to approach the game in a greater variety of ways  and really let people be comfortable on their favorite shaper in multiple situations rather than being forced into something that fit a meta the shapers could adapt their builds in order to better their teams  needs. I would also like to point out that by letting people play the same shaper in various ways it increased proficiency with those shapers and made for a more skilled player base. Sure other mobas had a ton of characters to select from but the ways in which you can competitively use them severely limited and new styles only really open up with patches that kill old ones. My point being was that the item system in dawngate was fair chunk of what made that game so much more enjoyable than other mobas.,dawngate,cqmtb34,2,t5_2x9kd

4186182,0,t3_38rav0,Risk of Rain is pretty good available through Steam for Windows and Linux. Sidescrolling roguelite shooterplatformer without mouse controls where you must survive unending hordes of enemies until you find a teleport to the next level and face a boss the final objective is to get back to the spaceship you were travelling in and leave the planet you crashed into. Difficulty increases as time goes on so durdling around is not a good choice. You unlock new characters theres around  or so by getting achievements in certain levels. Characters have  different abilities one of which is an autoattack and the only way to improve your character significantly other than levelling up that increases your stats is by getting random items dropped by monsters or buying them at shrines that give you passive abilities you can carry one item that gives you an active ability too. It has multiplayer up to  players IIRC both local and IPbased YAY OLD TIMES WHERE YOU COULD PLAY MULTIPLAYER WITHOUT THE NEED OF A CENTRAL SERVER AND AN INTERNET CONNECTION.It has some lore sprinkled around in the item descriptions before getting most of the items ingame you must unlock them by getting achievements YAY GAMES WHERE ACHIEVEMENTS ACTUALLY MEAN SOMETHING in a very much Dark Soulsish style. The characters are all pretty unique and have very different playstyles. Once you go through the first  levels you can choose to either go into the final level or keep rotating through maps with increasing difficulty to get some more items and level to beat the gameIt makes for pretty fun multiplayer games with friends in the same way a MOBA does and pretty much for the same reasons You gather a party and start a game where you all start equalized and you all need to survive and do your best to advance if someone dies they respawn if the team gets to the next level but they lose on items and experience. I managed to convince some friends to get it during a Steam sale and we had a lot of fun playing it. Basically its not a MOBA but it feels mechanically like some sort of MOBAlike PVE game. The good thing is that you can keep going and going and going until you die instead of having to finish the game once you reach a certain point. Ive played games where we died at  minutes but Ive read of people for whom  minutes is just the tip of the iceberg. You can finish a game in around  minutes if you know what youre doing though if the enemies dont kill you before that even. But you can also just sit in front of your PC all night if youre good enough and want to.Note Sometimes it has problems connecting to other people nothing good old Hamachi cant handle though. ,dawngate,crxfd3w,2,t5_2x9kd

4648473,0,t1_ctf6gfy,As someone who balances games it IS very well balanced.everything in DotA  has a counter play to it. Every single skill has an item skill or counterplay in the game which makes it useless. If you were having problems with huskar your supports or some carries should have been buying diffusal and halberd. Or getting bash. Or using armor to melt him with phys damage. Or outplaying him as to deny him the gold he needs to be any real threat.The thing you need to learn about DotA  is that every single hero in the game is equally IMBA and exploitable and that one of the major features of play is balancing your power curve against theirs making sure you get to a state where you can outplay or outmatch them and win the game.,dawngate,ctgi4li,2,t5_2x9kd

4764890,0,t1_ctuzah6,I liked the general feel of the various champions. Atroc for example felt like he was a nigh unstoppable rage beast. He jumped right into the fight drawing out the unthinking rage of his opponents taunting them and punished those who tried to fight back. A lot of those champions felt good in their niche their fantasy. Unfortunately a few things kept me from really putting in the time and enjoying the game.I hated the UI. Bright almost neon colors for items and many ability effects was a horrible idea. It took me a good week or so of daily playing just to figure out what some of the items were as they all kind of blended together into one of three colored blobs. I get wanting to keep a theme going for similar items but each themes color was both obnoxious and overpowering to the point where thats practically all I saw when looking at the shop menu.I also disliked how clunky the game felt to play especially as a ranged character. Having to sit there for your entire auto attack animation was pretty shitty and didnt feel smooth at all. Some abilities were also pretty unresponsive like Wonder Womans lasso or didnt feel like the graphic matched up with the hitbox very well. A lot of little things like that kind of dug at me a little bit each time and I soon found myself not really enjoying the game very much.I appreciate that they gave some attention to lesser known characters in the DC universe but I think that ultimately cost them players. It was too soon for Krypto and Star Sapphire to be out as there were a few really popular characters they could have and should have put out there to secure a strong player base before branching out with fun but quirky characters.,dawngate,ctv5pt2,3,t5_2x9kd
