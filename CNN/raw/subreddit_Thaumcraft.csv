551356,0,t3_20g7v0,Yes There is an upgrade you can craft and place ontop of the recharging pedestal. The compound gets broken down into one of the primal aspects its comprised of.  If you have a particularly complex compound that means it can be used to charge several types of primal aspects. But it will still only charge  point for  point.,Thaumcraft,cg2y1s6,1,t5_2ty9u

915632,0,t3_24lc0m,Aura Nodes.  They are usually made of just primal aspects and you get several research points for each one you scan.  So put on your goggles and go exploring.Other ways include the deconstruction table.  You have to research it first before you can craft it but it will break down items and have a chance of giving you a research point.  Its a pretty slow process. And seeing as it destroys the items you might want to only put in renewable items such as chicken eggs.A popular method is using buffer points.  You might have notices that some aspects have a glowing star next to them in the research table. This means it has a buffer point that can be used once all the normal points are gone.  You can tell if you are about to use the buffer point because the aspect will not display a number. But to get to the buffer point you need to use all your normal points first.Buffer points normally regenerate over time.  They are granted by things in the area. Most commonly crystal clusters.  water crystal clusters will generate a water buffer point earth for earth and so on.  Iv found the mixed crystal cluster grants a buffer point to a random aspect and once that buffer is used it will give it to a different aspect.But its not just the clusters that give them. Things like aura nodes and book shelves have been reported to also grant points.But you can only ever have  buffer point of an aspect at a time.Its unsure if having multiple crystal clusters cause the aspect to generate buffer points faster or not but the general consensus is no.Some if this info may be outdated or just plain wrong.,Thaumcraft,ch8d3gx,1,t5_2ty9u

With an aggregator havent built one yet it allows the locus to work as a mirror for all the jars it sees.

6200862,0,t3_40ildy,Have you played the games Doodle God or Alchemy? If so Aspects work exactly like that. However Ill assume you havent and give you the long form explanation.  Aspects come in two flavorsPrimal and Compound Aspects. Primal Aspects are the six big ones you probably read aboutAer Air Ignis Fire Ordo Order Aqua Water Terra Earth and Perditio Entropy.  Compound Aspects are aspects that are made out of  other aspects. For instance Potentia Energy is a combination of Ignis Fire and Ordo Order. Compound Aspects can be made out of Primal Aspects other Compound Aspects or a mix of each. You can find a list of all aspects and their recipes that you know of in the Thaumonomicom entry Aspects of Magic.  Research then is attempting to chain two aspects together in a string of aspects. What you do is take the primals youre given on the left hand side of the research table and place them in the grid on the right OR left click them to move them to the bottom left corner wherr you can combine them into compounds. Aspects will only link to each other in the grid if they are a part of each other in some way. For instance Potentia will link to Ignis because Potentia is Fire  Ordo. So if you wanted to link together Ignis and Ordo youd put a Potentia in the middle since it links to both of those.,Thaumcraft,cyugzmq,2,t5_2ty9u

It was a world spawn and I did not konw what it was before I had set up a significant portion of my base and I just wanted to stop it before it became a greater issue so thaat I would not have to worry about it or break away from the mods I was focusing on.

11551580,0,t3_64vl4n,I would certainly be interested in helping outplaying but there are some...well obvious problems with the idea of running a server for this pack.Mystcraft and Dimensional Doors are EXTREMELY intensive on servers. Mystcraft would have to be pretty much adminonly due to the sheer number of worlds that could be created. Dimensional Doors is less of an issue but each pocket dimension exists as its OWN dimension folder. It adds up. And deleting them with or without players inside doesnt always work and can often cause world corruption.SSTOW I personally would keep. With the whole redstone controlled thing at T you could make them MUCH less intensive than normal mob farms by disabling them with something like a daynight switch active during day to maximize mobs inactive during night to let normal mobs spawn for others.Project E is also a HUGE thing for servers partially because it makes the game so trivial. You can literally become unkillable within a day if you know what youre doing with or without collectors. Autocobble works wonders.Just as a note as well I personally had a LOT of problems with Runic Dungeonsspecifically one spawner boss was broken and would crash the server if spawned making raiding the dungeons next to impossible.Thats just my two cents but...,Thaumcraft,dg5di9a,2,t5_2ty9u
