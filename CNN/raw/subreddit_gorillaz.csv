1508756,0,t3_2bfl4q,I believe its the unique look and sound that they bring to their music. Look at todays music right now and tell me what  percent of people find good Hardcore rap about bitches and money party anthems and watered down pop. Granted there is more music than that but it often gets turned into a thing that fades after  or three years while pop music never ever leaves. So when a cartoon band that has insanely original musical talent and style gets a top  hit people really take notice and get hooked. Thats my take anyway. I listened to Feel Good Inc on the radio for years and i NEVER forgot that song. In  i actual got into Gorillaz and now i know everything about them,gorillaz,cj5ec0k,1,t5_2rnhi

2217446,0,t3_2ki3mc,I do not see what youre seeing. It hardly fits at all. Man Research is a fairly sinister sounding song while this video is basically A Day in the Life of D!. Sure Andre turned his head in time with a sound in the song but parts were the music picks up were accompanied by shots of Murdoc on a chair and D eating his own snot.Yes theres a reference to  but that hardly counts as evidence as we also get references to DARE the video is on while the Boogieman is reading a newspaper Stylo the car has crashed out the front and the videos for Feel Good Inc and El Maana the windmill appears at the end.These sort of coincidences happen a lot. Most famously if you play the album The Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz it fits really well. Thats not because Pink Floyd were huge fans of the movie and wanted to make their own soundtrack its because they were a similar length and because soon enough there was bound to be an album that fit well.Sorry to burst your bubble but I really dont think theres anything to get excited about here.,gorillaz,cllovcd,1,t5_2rnhi
2256511,0,t1_clqk1np,They actually go into specifics a little more Russel was doing something aimlessly he may have been institutionalized Im not sure and he heard somehow that Murdoc was making a new Gorillaz album but using a drum machine instead of him.  He became extremely angry leading to thisWhile swimming allllll the way towards Point NemoPlastic Beach he got sustenance by eating stuff straight from the bottom of the ocean.  A lot of this stuff happened to be irradiatedtoxic in some way and thats what caused him to grow to a gigantic size.Russell along with Noodle unfortunately never got their fair shake in the Plastic Beach storyline and we never really got to see what was going on in his head.

3300280,0,t1_cp4fvit,Im going to disagree because I feel your being too optimistic about the message what D is saying is dont trust anyone ever. The people in his vision are evil malicious ubiquitously sinister. All people. Even those that profess love and honor they will turn on you for one reason or another. Forethought has nothing to do with it. This is a dystopian nightmare people will betray you. The closer they get the worse it will be. This is partially why I posit that D is a paranoid schizophrenic. Its much more deeply inlaid then just mean people are going to try to take advantage of you. Its saying that everyone will destroy you because that is the end goal of every person. To take advantage of the innocent the goodnatured. Even those that started good will eventually be led down the road where they cause suffering. Again its a cartoon thats why it is so drastic. But thats what I get from it. ,gorillaz,cp4gidf,1,t5_2rnhi

Bleary eyed he stares at his computer screen. Ralphwiggum Cmon... just a few more minutes....Mysterious voice Cmon Ralph give it up. Sitting on the couch next to Ralph is a ghostly apparition resembling British pop singer Damon Albarn. He has a concerned look on his face. Ralphwiggum I need to find the perfect version of broken. We need to give the reader what they want. Thats the only way were going to master the project W.W The fact that you would even try to wrap your head around this is admirable enough. Why do you have to pin it down like this? Ralph I mean were just getting to the meaty stuff... surely you can see the masterclass Damon gives us for the Plastic Beach finale. W I do but isnt it selfexplanatory. Ralph I have no idea Ive spent to much time thinking about it. I mean Brokens the real point of the album isnt it? Its the zeitgeist. The bird with the broken wing. The fading of relationships of love and personal contact... the idea that this is the true fate of the universe. W Hmm... kinda like Blur huh?Ralph Excuse me? W I mean Blurs kinda the opposite but a lot of their stuff is based around this idea that yknow theres a universal foundation of man and this is the light in the bleakness of the universe and mankind is just a microcosm of this. Ralph I mean iduno man. I think that theres a little more to it than that. W Then by all means good sir. Takes out teacup sips politelyRalph Well this song is Damon. It sounds like Damon is singing yknow not a lot of D there. But its negative. Its saying that this is inevitable. All of these breakdowns are just going to happen were designed towards entropy. The human race is essentially doomed the odds of us surviving a supernova or a collapse of stars is nearly zero. This is the true natural state of things.W Yeah so its kind of an antiDamon. Ralph Yes... but places fist under chin ruminates I mean... isnt that just a perfect response to anxieties of the modern age? Yeah it feels broken. We feel broken... but isnt the fact that we recognize this ultimately positive in its reflection upon the state of society? That we can understand even with our tendencies towards fatalism or cynicism... that we can be positive we can try to... iduno... fix it. As best we know how. W Kind of a cerebral message for such a simple song. I thought you were going to freak out about the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble or maybe the fact that the song is also about the fracturing of the Gorillaz band itself. Ralph I mean we know about all this its just going to take me forever to write this down succinctly. You wanna do this for me? W Im not real you fucking psycho. Ralph Hmm? W Nevermind. Sure buddy!

5464378,0,t3_3pvfmi,The problem with Glastonbury  was that they didnt use all the hits most notably  and that they stacked the set with the monster biggest hits backtoback all the way at the end of the set. This was not a good idea. While things like the triple Demon Days section at the start of the set Last Living Souls  O Green World  Kids with Guns may work for fans their crowd was much more diverse. Then at the end things were very poorly paced with  nonhits in a row following DARE including the criticized Pirate Jet singalong attempt. Heres an attempt at something that may not flow as well but would certainly better keep the attention of casual listenersVideo intro. Last Living Souls. . O Green World. Stylo. On Melancholy Hill.

9054992,0,t3_54abz1,First off calm down. Being disappointed is perfectly justified after all signs pointed towards an announcement yesterday but calm down. There is so much hyperbole in the OP that its almost painful to read.That being said an announcement did not need to happen yesterday its entirely plausible that this was never the intention. If anything the whole deal with the rd of September being the perfect day to drop something was a pure coincidence or a red herring intended to build hype in the event that Gorillaz were aware of it and yes it does build hype just because something you expected to happen didnt happen doesnt mean the hype has been killed off to any degree. If anything it should satiate the desire for more news even further.Secondly this whole idea that Damon and Jamie and collaborators and the label all do what they do to pander to the fanbase which is ultimately a small group of people on the Internet if this sub is anything to go by is completely narrowminded for obvious reasons.Finally Id like to address the fact and yes this actually is a fact unlike pretty much anything in the OP that a hack on that scale would not cease or delay plans to release something. Yes its shitty that Damons accounts got hacked but at the end of the day its not the sort of thing that would delay an annoucement that  if it was planned  would be handled by a group of PR persons entirely separate from the group who would deal with the situation with Damons accounts. This is a classic case of totally blownout expectations vs reality. Its not the end of the world the album is coming and youve not been betrayed by anything other than your own expectations. Gorillaz everyone involved dont exist solely to pander to you or the small in the grand scheme of things Gorillaz is a very commercially successful project on a mainstream scale group of people youre a part of. It could be argued that subjectively the social media presence established earlier this week seemingly leading up to something happening on Friday was a bad move in some ways somewhat awkwardly timed. This is my personal opinion but Im not any less excited for news. I feel like you just want your expectations affirmed so badly that its hurt you more than it really should have. Also the hacker did a shitty thing but its not like he hurt anyone in the process.Calm down.,gorillaz,d809kd9,15,t5_2rnhi

And I also ask that to everyone who downvoted me and up voted you  I believe it was meant as a live accompaniment but as superfast jellyfish was released they needed A video to go with it as that was all they had they used it.

As far as I can tell the listings for each are identical with the only difference being that the deluxe edition is more expensive. Could you tell me exactly what the difference is between the deluxe edition vinyl and the standard edition vinyl?I got a reply this morning which basically just said I dont know but I will contact the relevant department and find out you will have your query answered within a maximum of five days.For now thats all Ive got but Ill save this post and update you when Ive received an answer. I think there is a good chance its the same as the art book edition from the Gorillaz store though. Largely because the listing on the Gorillaz store stated that the vinyl itself was housed inside the art book.As for the delivery date thing others have mentioned I ordered mine about an hour after it went on sale and right now my order still says guaranteed delivery date th April ,gorillaz,dfdrwb2,2,t5_2rnhi

11594066,0,t1_dg1qhfx,I dont think hes on the new album but hes definitely performing with the Gorillaz. Del was very fortunate to be involved with the Gorillaz and got the chance because Dan the Automator was doing some production on the first album I believe. One thing worth noting... Gorillaz are playing Outside Lands in S.F.... as are Little Dragon and RagnBone Man who is on The Apprentice on the extended version of Humanz. But the connection people might overlook is Dr. Octagon... turns out that Del and Dan the Automator performed live with them recently so expect Del and Dan to be involved at least somewhat with the Gorillaz tour. Both of them live around Oakland.  There are probably a bunch of regular Gorillaz contributors around L.A. on a regular basis. Expect the L.A. gigs to be happening around the same time as Outside Lands with a lot of crossover as far as musicians. ,gorillaz,dga7203,3,t5_2rnhi

11661477,0,t3_66e9u2,Honestly its other people you have to worry about MUCH more than bots. My venue St. Paul MN is only about  capacity. The demand is simply higher than supply so tickets sell out right away to fans that want to go. Add in ordinary opportunistic people not necessarily professional scalpers who figure they can try and buy tickets just to easily flip on the secondary market for a profit and you have your problem.  PLUS a significant portion of tickets are held back for all the presales the band industry insiders and the venue  so by the time the general onsale starts Friday a significant portion of tickets are already long gone before the general public gets a chance to buy even a single ticket.Ive been to shows like Radiohead recently where you are required to present the credit card used to purchase tickets at the venue for entry your entire party has to enter together and no physical tickets are ever distributed. Makes scalping significantly harder and although the show still sold out right away at least it was full of fans who got in for face value. Buying concert tickets for in demand events is simply not a fair fight. Ok rant over.,gorillaz,dghud87,4,t5_2rnhi
11663724,0,t3_66c2fr,I bought incubus tickets last summer and it included the album. I never got it...but thats another story. They give you one copy per order so youll only get one CD even if you buy  tickets. And yes you put in your address when you buy the ticket. ,gorillaz,dgi3jgb,1,t5_2rnhi

11782197,0,t1_dgvj5zl,Yeh. Some of his examples were Popcaan as Bob Marley tho obv a different style of lyrics. Less peace based more fuck the system and Vince Staples as EasyE with their common theme of talking about race relations while also sexualising women in some of their lyrics. Tho also paying lip service to womens rights All these liberated women,gorillaz,dgvjtbg,3,t5_2rnhi

11786021,0,t3_684thx,I have a rule about Pitchfork reviews that has served me well  Do not miss their toprated albums but its safe to ignore their other review scores because their justification for them is frequently complete bullshit.  Theyve given low scores to some truly incredible albums.  Its best to just ignore them.,gorillaz,dgvzgh4,8,t5_2rnhi
