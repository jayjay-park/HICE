947928,0,t1_chbur6z,My husband is getting the shield but I personally liked this one more. If you have a gander near by they are . with a  mail in rebate so the price was pretty nice as well,TexasCHL,chc1c2j,1,t5_31llc
971519,0,t1_cheoeh6,It was too small for my hands. The frame isnt what I want out of an edc either. The safety sticks out pretty far. And I couldnt shoot it worth a Damn. That might be more of a user issue though. ,TexasCHL,chepyz6,2,t5_31llc
1194344,0,t3_27qhsf,Quick note Be sure to click the upload button before clicking the submit button.  I neglected to do this and my forms didnt upload so the process was delayed by about a week before I was notified via email that there were no documents submitted with my renewal.,TexasCHL,ci3zdkx,3,t5_31llc
1520009,0,t3_2bjtot,FWIW I got mine  weeks after full submission... years ago.  It sounds to me like the delays over the past year or so were a result of the panic from Newtown and whatnot and its just now settling back down into what it would normally be.This isnt something new this is normal.,TexasCHL,cj6t6f1,1,t5_31llc
2397064,0,t1_cm7jn33,I wont either...Ill be the first to build a fullauto SBR with a SUPPRESSOR! But because I can? Nah itd be sweet to have a full auto mm hog gun. Any full auto rifle round would be useless too hard to control.,TexasCHL,cm7zgiq,1,t5_31llc
3054980,0,t1_coej3ao,Thanks for sharing to me it sounds like your response to the situation was well assessed and appropriate.  Well the other peoples reaction to the situation likely prevented the child from being taken they also put themselves in unnecessary risk.Again thanks for sharing this.,TexasCHL,coenagx,3,t5_31llc
3134677,0,t1_comn2hh,I could definitely see some law makersgroups try to get some legislation passed to make it illegal in their particular state if statewide reciprocity were to pass. If not illegal than extremely inconvenient to carry. Of course I imagine if they pull something like you suggested and actually are able to get it passed they would be sued very quickly. Counties in California are already being sued for making it difficult for their citizens to obtain CHL permits to begin with. If something like what you suggest were to be passed it would make it illegal for a large number CCW holders in California to carry. Because from what I remember in California having a CCW does not exempt you from the gun free zones law. Could you imagine being a CCW holder and having to unholster and place your handgun in a locked container prior to entering a school zone? That just sounds crazy. ,TexasCHL,comwn8r,2,t5_31llc
3308922,0,t3_2y0n82,I have a problem of putting the word Honorable in front of the name Dan Patrick... but I will send in a version of this letter to all concerned.  Thanks for the info.,TexasCHL,cp5g0ap,3,t5_31llc
4153484,0,t3_38a0mx,IANAL it seems like it would be a legitimate shot if you did shoot them.Personally Im going to draw and keep aware. If all they want is the money then Im just doing my best to give a good description to the police when they arrive. If it looks like it might go bad I may intervene if it can be done safely. The thing is though that I cant make a decision until that situation arrives and the exact details are clear. ,TexasCHL,crtplh7,2,t5_31llc

6125516,0,t3_3zfehx,He probably gets kickbacks for endorsing the brand. Not saying they are bad but they probably arent anything special. ,TexasCHL,cylwoca,5,t5_31llc
8068718,0,t3_4pkolq,I have a Raw Dog Tactical for my PPS and I really like the way it fits me. Honestly though I have not tried a ton of them but this was like the nd or rd and I had no reason to keep looking once I got it in. Will see how long it holds up but so far so good.  ,TexasCHL,d4n00kp,1,t5_31llc
