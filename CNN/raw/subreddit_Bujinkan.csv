There are a number of different groups in the bujinkan with all kinds of different beliefs about the art ranging from purely physical to purely spiritual.  The thing is Soke will feed you what youre hung up on be it rank mysticism praise etc.  However we are contstantly taught to let go of anger wepons the body baggage or we. I think the mysticism is irrelevant. I believe its Nagato sensei that has that tshirt shut up and train. I think this is whats most important to learn from Bujinkan. Forget the bullshit just train and get better and a lot of the times your questions are answered or even built upon without you even having to ask. In the end empty curiosity is only going to hurt your training. Just show up and train till you figure shit out on your own.,Bujinkan,cfwaqnn,5,t5_2qqxu

The way they teach it in class is the basic classical form of the tecnhique which forms the foundation of your movement when applying the tecnhique it is not an actual tecnhique itself. Instead of explaining look at this video. The Henka part is the practical application of the ichmonji technique.There is no talking in this video only demonstration,Bujinkan,ddcw7cg,1,t5_2qqxu
