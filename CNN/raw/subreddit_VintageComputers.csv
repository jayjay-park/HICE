1307965,0,t1_cgjrwqg,From  and youve gone through  hard drives?  I hope they were capacity upgrades not failures.One of my computers is one I built in high school.   mhz k with a voodoo  card.  Still runs I dont do much with it anymore.  It runs win  and I use it to play just about anything prequake .  It will play quake  just a tad little slow One of the reasons Im so attached is this is inside the case of the old  we used to run when I was a kid.  When the guts finally die Ill probably shove a micro itx in that case and use it as a file server or something.  This thing has somehow outlived all my other PCs. And its a supercheap MSI board I got on clearance in like  or something.  My other longlife PC is an old socket  board from .   years ago I finally moved it to the garage to use for microcontroller crap and built a more modern computer.  The thing is even though its oldass socket  there was no real reason to build a new computer.  It ran youtube netflix etc with no trouble.  I had upgraded the graphics card sometime between  and  so it was still running somewhat modern stuff it could keep up with all the shaders you wanted just as long as you didnt do a lot of CPU intensive stuff it was fine.,VintageComputers,cigrgp6,1,t5_2wmgk
