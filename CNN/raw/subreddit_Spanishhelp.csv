5502149,0,t3_3qdgoh,I posted this a little while ago... it might help. Integrating bad words into your vocabulary is pretty hard but you can probably learn some basic phrases. Somebody posted a pretty good link in the comments and honestly googling it not Google translate will help especially with knowing how to correctly use them. Theres plenty of great sources like any aspect of learning the language and they shouldnt be too difficult to find. Id be more than happy to link you directly to some Mexican specific sites if you need it!,Spanishhelp,cwey8y3,1,t5_2sjzy

8683357,0,t1_d6r0rbb,Close enough but no. Do you agree? is Ests de acuerdo?. Theres the verb acordar that means to reach an agreement but it doesnt have a pronoun or a preposition Ellos acordaron sthThey reached an agreement to do sth Ellos se acordaron de sthThey remembered sth and then theres estar de acuerdo that means to agree and is completely unambiguous because its so different to acordarse.,Spanishhelp,d6r1mqu,4,t5_2sjzy
