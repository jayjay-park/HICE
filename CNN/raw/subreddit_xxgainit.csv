86675,0,t3_1v2m7e,Hmmm it really depends. If like you mentioned planning and executing is hard for you you could look at the New Rules of Lifting for Women which has a structured workout plan and a section on nutrition. So far Ive been using the workout as from the book and its good cause I dont have to think about my workout. I just do what it tells me to. It also says yoga is good on off days so you could still continue with your yoga on other nonworkout days. Im not sure if it really answers your question but hope it helps in some way! ,xxgainit,ceoapay,1,t5_2x8li
