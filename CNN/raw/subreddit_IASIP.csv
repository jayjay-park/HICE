In a close second is when he wrote that good song about Paddys Pub and Dennis remarks that it doesnt contain anything about rape or spiders then after the gang locks him in the basement he breaks out high on spraypaint and sings the song about how everyone should go fuck themselves. Dennis When he went psycho during the high school reunion or I can go from flaccid to erect in a moments notice. and how excited Mac seems by it. Frank How old are you boy? Nineteen! Shit you dont look a day over . Mac When he shit his pants after the karate riot Country Mac caused in Mac Day or Science is a liar sometimes. Dee The Gang Broke Dee. Just the whole episode is wonderful. Also my favorite DennisCharlie moment is when they performed Dayman as Electric Dream Machine My favorite MacDennis moments are Lethal Weapons  and .

Like Dee expresses her issues and the gang learns to love and respect Dee as a person? but then I was like Nah this show knows better than that.

2521137,0,t3_2og3r4,Ok since nobody else is owning up to doing some bad things I will. Ive used it many times but three stories really stand out.  I was dating a girl and she invited me over for a couple night. Midway through the couples night she disappeared with another guy to go get high. This pissed me off so I decided right then and there that I would fuck her roommate and best friend. The roommate lets call her ally was very Christian and also very upset this very night and had hidden in her room the entire night. I demonstrated value by talking to her about my favorite bible verses and what they meant to me complete bullshit. I engaged physically by taking her on a walk and half way through started making out with her. I nurtured dependence by talking to her about her daddy issues and literally letting her cry one my shoulder. I neglected emotionally by disappearing for  weeks and when I saw her next pretending not to remember her. I inspired hope by telling her I was hurt because my ex had cheated on me and I was afraid. We banged. And I separated completely. I met a girl in class last year we will call her Jenny. I demonstrated value by doing well in the class and convincing her that Im super smart. I engaged physically by acting timid after taking her to coffee and she gave up and kissed me first. I nurtured dependence by helping her with her homework. I neglected emotionally by not taking her calls and making it clear that I was having sex with someone else I wasnt I inspired hope by convincing her we were such a great logical fit and that I was just afraid of moving to fast. We banged. And I asked her to leave.  and this is the worst one. I saved a target pharmacy paper bag and a pill bottle and I used to just fill it up with aspirin and carry the pills in the bag around target looking for babes. I found one that was slightly ugly but she was skinny and I hadnt had sex in a while so she would do. I started talking to her and mentioned that I had seen her working here about a month ago and switched my grandmas prescription to target just so I could see her that was demonstrating value. I engaged physically by taking her to coffee and telling her that she wasnt like other girls then giving her a soft peck. I nurtured dependence by telling her that I thought I could be really happy with her for the rest of my life. I neglected emotionally by not calling her or texting her for  weeks. I inspired hope by inviting her over in the middle of the night and telling her that she was so amazing that I couldnt not be in a relationship with her. I took her virginity. The next day I convinced her that she wasnt ready for a relationship and she truly thought it was her idea. Then I immediately redennised her by saying that I felt used and I had really cared for her. I fucked her in the ass and asked her to leave then got a burrito and blocked her number. They are terrible people on the show but everyone does bad things. Ive done terrible things and I will admit it. This is what you wanted. ,IASIP,cmnnfgd,9,t5_2s28b

Once Frank is shown to be a whiz at the game you know Dennis will try to box him out. I even called the final round down to the exact point because you know Charlie is good for  points and only  points so of course Frank will get . And Dennis thanks to his unceasing narcissism will screw himself and the team.Not saying I hated it I loved Dees man hands buzzer destruction and Macs inability to remember what game show they were playing but only a jabroni couldnt see right where it was headed almost immediately.,IASIP,cp4wa27,66,t5_2s28b

3588461,0,t3_31gafo,EDIT Forgot Dee and Frank are not daughter and father. For the purposes of marriage and the law I have no idea what that means! So you can probably ignore all my original typing below.Short answer In my jurisdiction a marriage between father and daughter would be void. Longer answer Depends on the jurisdiction. I dont know anything about Pennsylvania law. But in my jurisdiction we have common law marriage which doesnt require a ceremony or licensure just cohabitating and holding yourself out to others as married. If Frank and Dee held themselves out as married they would be considered as such. Them merely participating in the ceremony wo filing anything with the county would put them under a common law marriage if they so desired.Its basically a voidable marriage at that point however  years of this marriage shifts the presumption to married when dividing assets during divorce.They have a void marriage however since consanguinity within  or  family members including father and daughter.,IASIP,cq1b97d,4,t5_2s28b
3590267,1,t3_31h3ua,The ending fell a little flat as did this whole dark episode though I still enjoy it especially the Frank parts.My take on the ending They ship Psycho Pete off to LA meanwhile a similar gang the girl seemingly dressed like a female Charlie from out of town is dropping off their own crazy guy in Philly in the same manner of ditching him rather than helping him.

I think of Dee as a greyhound since their bodies are like crack skinny. Charlie could be a rat terrier small rambunctious bred to kill pests and prone to strange behavior like digging in the dirt. For Mac Im thinking border collie. Hes usually energetic and desperate for attention to the point that hes willing to go along with anything. He also has what might be considered herding instincts due to his need to control people in his selfappointed roles of the gangs brains and the sheriff of Paddys.

You can tell the actor is actually funny and contributing his own ideas to the character. As a rare matureresponsiblesane character he doesnt usually get the crazy funny lines but the way he delivers them just cracks me up.Last theres a lot of characters I love who just get two or three hilarious cameos. But theres just something about Rex. I love how hes the gangs goto guy when they need a male beefcake even showing up as an angel in Macs fantasy. But his complete airhead responses when Dee is trying to get him to act as The Master is just hilarious. Rexs genuine Oh shit reaction when Dennis reiterates Ive been speaking to the Supreme Overlord Master and thats Rexs boss is so fucking perfect.

The multiple threads asking why it didnt win an emmy etc. To me its strengths are very unlike those of classic iasip. Imo charlie work is good because it has a creative style  story unpredictable humor etc. But imo what Sunny does best is the banter often about nothing and the way they react to each other. Just the way they talk and their mannerisms I find amazing. For example Mac kills his dad to me is very close to a classic iasip and doesnt get enough love. To me that should be getting more attention because its hilarious and isnt such a novelty episode so to speak. Examples from that episode Charlie telling the worker to not stop moving bags because they never do on tv. When mac says Tell us more and bonnie talks about the gay sex mac instantly comes back with tell us less.,IASIP,cz346eh,5,t5_2s28b

6307857,0,t1_cz6id6u,I would say almost all of those are great episodes particularly The Gange Saves the Day The Gang Beats Boggs and Thunder Gun Express.,IASIP,cz6mryd,1,t5_2s28b
6307867,0,t1_cz6f0b8,Agreed. Tbh it feels sadId also add that I think Rob and Charlie  are working more and more on other projects letting in external writers. But then again the god awful Electric Boogaloo episode was written by Rob and Glenn.I have too much respect for Rob Glenn and Charlie to believe that they dont realize whats happening though... How can they let this quality drop happen? Should have stopped before season ,IASIP,cz6mtfg,1,t5_2s28b
6308287,1,t1_cz63bep,I agree. I think it was because the humour and writing here wasnt really what IASIP has been before. It was really corny probably by choice but I dont think that they made it humorous enough. Instead it kind of turned on them. For instance the delivery of the end twist was completely meaningless. I didnt really feel the dramatic tension. And why did it matter that Frank was fracking? Wouldnt losing still have meant that he couldnt frack? I dont think that you can frack a mountain in two days. At no point in the episode did the environmentalist make an appearance and I dont see how the competition would draw their attention without some context. Dennis wouldve competed regardless of the stakes so I dont really know if he cared about what he won as long as he did win.I dont really mind that they take an easy way out in the end. That can be humorous in its own right. But I dont think the twists closed up any meaningful holes in the plot. It didnt really do anything.The showing of boobs didnt really amount to anything great either. That twist they played up to was pretty weak imo. What does it matter that they were prostitutes? Doing it at all was pretty meaningless as they didnt get that much humour out of it. Usually they wouldve pulled some super creepy shit which would justify it completely.Charlies sex scene was ridiculous enough where it wasnt really out of place in a IASIP episode. But it didnt make any sense because Frank had hired the girl. Why would she want to make Charlie compete? If she didnt why would Frank want to have her and Charlie have sex? Didi she really just fuck him for the hell of it? How did Charlie just happen to be there for the show? No one got fucked over because of the sex. At the least I expected Dennis to flip his shit completely. They usually make good use of the ridiculous plotlines they build.When Frank ploughed in one of the lethal Weapon episodes there was some really funny context for the scene which was relevant throughout the episode.Another really weird and weak part was when the cop told the charges. Usually in an IASP episode the cop wouldnt have said anything then the crew wouldve taken a stand for the guy who was being taken into custody. A huge loud speech for the freedom of the people and they wouldve had people semi riled up you know most would be uninterested but a few of the worst looking individuals would give a bit of a whoo after which the cop wouldve told the charges with a disinterested voice. Then the gang wouldve gone into retreat mode doing a complete uturn on what they were going on about before.The hair shit was pretty weak too because at no point did anyone complement the guys hair. I wouldve imagined that somewhere near the start they complemented his hair then someone of them Dennis would be like Thats ridiculous yadda yadda. And after it was ripped off Mac wouldve gone wild pointing the hair and acting as if it being fake was what sealed the guys character not the lewd sexual behaviour.I think they intended to put the gang in a new position where they were judging someone elses actions but seemingly were the only ones to deem them inappropriate. Slowly theyd become convinced that the guy wasnt that bad and then at the end theyd align themselves with the super shady character by defending them only to be revealed the fact that what they suspected at the beginning was true all along. Then they shouldve been left wondering but why did the women just get rid of their tops and then Frank would reveal why and it all would lock into place.But I dont think they foreshadowed this enough in the bra ripping scene. Its not as if there havent been real lewd women in the show before. On the other hand the scene in which the guy fapped there was no questioning his shady nature. That kind of lead me to believe that at that point the gang made their mind of him  I did at least.Rob pretty clearly went out of character in the scene but it wouldve been a great chance to pin in a joke of his denied homosexuality. He couldve just made some super small movement to hide his boner.This season hasnt been that strong so far. I hope its intentional on their part. I wouldnt put it past them to fuck with the audience on purpose just to see what they can get away with.,IASIP,cz6ojg1,8,t5_2s28b
6308442,0,t1_cz6n2d9,Im kinda agnostic to whether or not Steven Avery did it and far more concerned about the tactics used by the police interrogators especially involving Brendan Dassey. Additionally while Steven may have been guilty there was just no real evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. That doesnt mean I think hes innocent in any way. But I do think that even if he was guilty the prosecution did a horrible job and there is tons of conflicts of interest even with the jurors. I see Making a Murderer as more about the mishandling of the legal process than it is about an innocent person other than Dassey who I think didnt do jack being sentenced to a crime they didnt commit. I viewed it that there was too much mishandling of evidence perimeters not kept evidenceentry logs not kept family home raided without ability to reenter multiple times and that the prosecution should never have been able to take the case to court the way they did. Should have been thrown out again and again. But it wasnt and both dudes were convicted when they really shouldnt have been. That whole documentary terrified me with how little evidence he was convicted on and Brendan too. Even if Steven did it the lack of paperwork and proper procedure following through should have left the police with too little or a completely thrown out case that the local PD would forever see as The one that got away. But I subscribe to the better  guilty go free than  innocent be jailed motto. ,IASIP,cz6p6bu,57,t5_2s28b

A broken nose as a comedy prop has never been so well done and the gang hangs a lampshade on their bench. The Gang Gives Frank an Intervention. Just a great episode with everyone in their element.

11048413,0,t3_5xoo9a,.  Hero or Hate Crime?  I think this could easily end up being top ten of all time material and its definitely one of the most important episodes of the shows run.  Theres just nothing better than the whole gang stuck together for a whole episode having an argument see The Cereal Defense another of my favorites..  The Gang Goes to a Waterpark  All three plotlines were hilarious and came back together in a fantastic way.  Standard Sunny and just what we want..  The Gang Turns Black  Definitely not standard Sunny.  Sometimes the weird episodes dont fit sometimes they pay off and this one did big time.  Great music fun choreography or lack thereoflooking at you Danny and a nice cameo all wrapped up in a plot thats taking a serious look at society in a hilariously twisted way..  The Gang Tends Bar  Another one with the gang all together doing what they do bestpretty much nothing.  Bonus points for bringing us the Yuck Puddle..  PTSDee  My favorite episode title of the season and also a fun chance to remind us that Dee is just as awful as the rest of the gang and oftentimes way worse.  Also Charlie as Boy is a delight..  Old Lady House  A Situation Comedy  Mrs. Mac and Mrs. Kelly are hilarious but usually best in small doses so I was worried about this one but it turned out to be pretty funny.  Not quite as good as Gang Tries Desperately to Win an Award but still a fun mocking of traditional sitcoms..  Making Dennis Reynolds a Murderer  Confession  I havent seen Making a Murderer so a lot of jokes were probably list on me.  Lots of funny bits but just a bit too out there for my tastes.  Not bad by any means but not a favorite either..  Wolf Cola  A Public Relations Nightmare  The Reynolds family side of things was very funny the Boca RatonBoko Haram mix up was genius but the Mac and Charlie story fell flat.  Which is a shame because I love Fight Milk!  For bodyguards by bodyguards . . . and Charlie  .  A Crickets Tale  Ehhhhh . . . Cricket is also great in small doses but this was overkill.  Also not enough of the gang at all. ,IASIP,dekbhcw,11,t5_2s28b

11246990,0,t1_df6s1am,I completely get what you are saying. Not only that but there are actual times he just plain out tells the bad guys to just leave after he promptly kicks their asses. The dialogue feels forced. I dont think you have to tell a ninja or martial artist to leave when he knows he has no chance of winning. It is like enter bad guys stage right and there you go they show up do a martial arts stance and start fighting. In DareDevil I felt like the places DareDevil went to were places he knew he would run into trouble. So running into a group of guards actually guarding something seems much more plausible than just having bad guys show up every now and then. Also the way Iron Fist sneaks around kills me. In straight regular tailor made suits walking directly behind supposed masters of martial arts. At least in Dare Devil we know why he is so good at investigating.,IASIP,df6tvh3,3,t5_2s28b

Some examples are The Beatles Steely Dan Nirvana and Earth Wind and Fire. Other times various collaborators work on a song and release it on a collaborators album often that of the performer . Such examples include I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry Hello by Adele and of course Run the Word Girls by Beyonce. It also isnt uncommon for the singer to not be involved in the writing process. Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley are wellknow examples. ,IASIP,dfgk0zv,24,t5_2s28b
