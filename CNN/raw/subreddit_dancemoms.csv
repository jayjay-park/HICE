377385,0,t1_cfjs7wv,Exactly! I remember a season or two ago Abby called Chloe a snake and said she was always sneaky... I cannot see that at all. Chloe seems like a sweet quiet slightly shy girl with a bit of trust issues. Sure Christi is too much at times but the hatred Abby shows towards Chloe is ridiculous.I do think Chloe was not trying as hard as she used to with Maddie for a while and they werent as closely matched as the first season but I think it was entirely Abbys fault and she was turning Chloe off to dance. It does seem like Chloe is starting to get back to her normal good dancing self though. The show doesnt focus as much attention on her as it used to however,dancemoms,cfjvqo2,5,t5_2u0sl
431923,0,t1_cfpig40,I would still rather listen to Brooke instead of Mackenzie any day.But youre right both of their singing is..eh..Im not wanting to sound rude but honestly give someone a recording studio lots of money..

689412,0,t3_221g4u,oh man this episodeCan I be the first to say that within the first  minutes I was already choking back tears? The children were sad for Mrs. Miller Abbey was sad.. And when Abbey offered to hug Chloe is where I nearly lost it.She still cares about the girl she really does. It just takes a lot for her to show it. This was a really emotional episode as it was mainly centered around Abbey losing her mother and the girls were really taking that in..I shed a few tears it was heart breaking.Onto the dances! I loved that group number though I think Nia shouldve been a part of it and perhaps Kenzie taken out Nio wouldve suited that dance much better.Nia seems like shes getting very easy solos and in turn not getting a high spot. It was alright.. I hated the costume her facials were great though! but the dance felt like.. poses.Kendalls solo was pretty cool she does well in Jazz and looked like she was having fun!it was nice to see no mama drama!,dancemoms,cgimyz2,9,t5_2u0sl

4054018,0,t3_36yzeq,I dont think this was really it.  Abby was dissapointed in herself for messing this up so see wasnt as rude or happylike she normally is when she wins a competition about the show itself after. When she doesnt tellcritique maddie on anything or stands up for her mistake she knows she messed up and on a huge performance like this then its all gong to hurt her. ,dancemoms,crie09h,3,t5_2u0sl
4307708,0,t1_csa7fyk,So now that Ive watched the episode I agree with you in this particular case. But  I think she knows that even if the ALDC wins Abby and her mom freak out if shes not first.

Not a fear of disappointing reasonable people that is but the stress of being around irrational and emotional ones.,dancemoms,csb7d5c,5,t5_2u0sl

6528551,0,t1_czudhy4,Its a shared heritage but not really a heritage in the cultural sense in that everyone dances like that because they are of african heritage. The only thing Nia has in common with that dance is her ancestry but that doesnt mean that she automatically is genetically made to know certain dances or move a certain way. To think that way is not okay.The way Abby said it sounded more like You never trained in this dance style. Still Im surprised Kalani is better at a black dance because you are black and should automatically be able to dance black dances because you have those genes. Theres no sense in that.That is not okay.,dancemoms,czulr70,21,t5_2u0sl

6562287,0,t1_czy2eu9,Id say they arent as competitive on a national level but would still be considered above average for their age. Nia although I love her is probably least competitive for her age but Id still consider her above average.Heres some results that might help put things into perspectiveAt JUMP Pittsburgh  Nia Kendall Mackenzie and Maddie competed solos in their divisions. Maddie won her division with a You rocked Jump! award which meant she got a nearly perfect score  out of . Kendall placed nd in her division Mackenzie placed rd in hers Nia didnt place. All of them received High Gold  out of  awards.There was also a scholarship competition on the sidethe girls take classes learn a routine and audition for scholarships. Maddie and Mackenzie won VIP scholarships while Kendall got a runnerup prize. Kalani also competed for a scholarship and got VIP. These scholarships were what qualified the girls to attend The Dance Awards nationals.At NUVO Minneapolis  another competition that also feeds into The Dance Awards Jojo competed a solo and also auditioned for a scholarship. Jojo won th place in her category for her solo receiving High Gold and won a Breakout Artist scholarship equivalent of VIP scholarship at JUMP.

7318590,0,t3_4fjbkr,TT Edit Never thought Id admit that haha. Now its stuck in my head again too thanks to this question. Sometimes I come back to it purely because of the absurdity of the whole video. What makes me laugh about it is the joy and enthusiasm the kids have while dancing to it. Its just as catchy as the song yet also cringy hilarious at the same time. They dance the sexual moves in a completely nonsexual way without any awareness of what this is supposed to mean... sometimes duckfacing because that is the closest theyll get to understanding what it is about... smiling and blissfull unaware of what Kelly would mean with the word prostitods.,dancemoms,d2a2o05,6,t5_2u0sl
7322068,0,t1_d2acvv3,Personally I am disgusted with her.She isnt just a bystander who should be speaking up she joined in the bullying. and she did so at a crucial moment  when the other mums were trying to play it off like Ashlee wasnt mad about what they said but about something else. like they had done no wrong. and before that she was talking like ashlee deserved the bullying towards her daughter.I see her on twitter playing it off like she was just joking and apparently people dont get it because they dont know oldschool hip hop.It was an incredibly inappropriate time for that comment and holly has more tact than that. Shes just a bully now in my eyes at least.,dancemoms,d2agw06,19,t5_2u0sl

10292622,0,t1_dcap9qm,I feel that too I just wish there was proof. And if there was you know the producers wouldve put the footage in or would have had a mom find and read said proof out loud to everyone.So Im not sure what is going on. ,dancemoms,dcaq3a3,7,t5_2u0sl

10685744,0,t1_ddhwpe4,Youre a classed as a guest on the team until youre given an ALDC jacket. Although I wish the guest girls could wear a cardijacket of the same colour just so they dont stand out so much during awards.Abby uploaded a video to Instagram a while ago with her and a dancer saying that production wanted Abby to give her the jacket but it doesnt mean that shes part ofon the team. ,dancemoms,ddi5k4o,16,t5_2u0sl
10686043,1,t1_ddhvjeg,...interesting point. I mean Melissas parenting resulted in Maddie. And Maddie apocryphally lives with Sia now due to anxiety resulting from aggressive parenting style of Melissa. So. Success in a way I suppose.,dancemoms,ddi6ofj,5,t5_2u0sl

10855176,0,t3_5v3k4z,I have a lot of respect for her for posting this. I feel like a lot of it was more in defense of Nicaya than herself which shows how much she cares about her daughter. I believe it that Nicaya is a sweet girl. While I dont think walking up to a mom and trashing their child is the best way to express an opinion it is just a TV show and she is doing it to get screen time  getting paid.Side note I also think its interesting how the show has been making edits since season  I didnt realize they were making word salads that early on. ,dancemoms,ddzmuu3,9,t5_2u0sl

11155255,0,t1_dewczxc,She put bleach on her  year olds skull. There is no plausible reason to dye your childs hair that young.
