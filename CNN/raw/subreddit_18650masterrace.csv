5810681,0,t3_3un6io,you would be better off posting this in rflashlights no?Anyways its just a shitty battery or a shitty protection circuit board tripping on the battery not sure what cell Nuon uses. Good batteries shouldnt do this to you.  Just to add to this you dont need an unprotected cell as a quality battery will be good. That said most flashlights have protection against overdischarging your batteries so its not really dangerous to use unprotected cells.,18650masterrace,cxhdbzs,1,t5_38zm9

7943015,0,t3_4nz8eo,I use a Miller ML and turn them into USB battery packs that I use to charge USB devices when Im off the grid.  I go motorcycle camping and I can charge the s from the bike using the Miller then use the Miller to keep things charged in my tent at night.I think people have also linked a bluetooth speaker and a portable fan on this subreddit but of which use removable  batteries.I do wish that there were more consumer electronics that used them.  For example I use a Sena S bluetooth intercom in my motorcycle helmet and if it used a removable  battery I wouldnt have to worry about it dying during a ride.  I could just swap in a fresh battery.I wish the GoPro had an adapter for an .  The waterproof case is almost as wide as an  is long.,18650masterrace,d48vakj,5,t5_38zm9
8891211,0,t3_4iw9ct,Short answer Dont.  Not with your current state of knowledge of lithium cells.,18650masterrace,d7glipy,1,t5_38zm9
9664448,0,t3_579m6a,While I also understand that the tabber is better not everybody has access to a machine or someone who does it.  are capable of handling heat much much better than we think. So instead of just saying its better or worse lets try to find someone who soldered batteries and tested their mah before and after.,18650masterrace,da4cg44,1,t5_38zm9
10782839,0,t1_dds45ea,Yea thats super helpful! Thats basically the test I wanted to do but with control and magnet groups as well. Very interesting!Unfortunately it suffers from the same flaw my tests will suffer from small sample size meaning the results arent definitive but the anecdotal evidence is still valuable.How much current do you pull from each cell through the magnets? The main downside Ive heard regarding magnets is their current carrying capacity.,18650masterrace,dds66f0,3,t5_38zm9
11064381,0,t3_5xuceq,I threw mine out. It was draining the cells to V even when it was just sitting there.,18650masterrace,dem4y5w,1,t5_38zm9
11465686,0,t1_dfu6gk3,Id recommend doing that it would be safer. ,18650masterrace,dfvmn9e,1,t5_38zm9
