808367,0,t1_cgvn3x6,Thanks for doing an awesome job on organizing the info in this discussion btw really excellent work. This is going to turn into a bit of an unorganized infodump of what i have been reading up on during the last  days. Well you got me looking into alternatives since i am also considering a new pfsense box. I found another offering from the same vendor. caveat i have precisely NO experience with him. So deal with him at your own risk you are basically buying direct from china.This has  Intel onboard nics and comes in a rackmount cabinet. It is however  and then you have to add shipping and ram  SSDCFcard. Some info  insight might be gained from following this thread on the pfsense forums. Though DragonPF user on the pfsense forum is referencing items only available on taobao not aliexpress aliexpress is basically the international version of taobao and maintained by the same company as far as i can tell. If you are interested in Taobao only items the best way i am aware of is to go through a taobao agent who will basically buy and ship the items to you after you have paid them. I have basically zero idea of which way is better  cheaper.I hope its pretty clear that there are certain risks in dealing with basically unknown operators located in China. this is true for both aliexpress and taobao  various agents I am also uncertain as to what performance can be expected out of the CU based boards. The only far from confirmed figures i have found are about mbps routing for the alix APUC and mbps routing for the CU solutions both of these are from the respective homepages and might have been dreamt up in both cases for all i know. What that means in PPS is anyones guess. If those figures are from jperf with byte packets its around kppskpps which btw is so good that its unlikely to be the case The Cisco ASA X is listed as being capacble of kpps.I am tempted to buy one just to find out at this point gt.ltTLDR Got caught up in exploring options for a dedicated pfsense box and went on to learn that routing is complicated and there is relatively poor documentation about what perfomance one can expect out of what cpusystem with pfsense.,homelab,cgw5z7k,1,t5_2ubz7

1244857,0,t3_28afda,Backblazes usage of drives is a long continuous incremental backup.  The client does the initial backup by encrypting each files in the backup set along with filename location and signatures of said file so it only reuploads again on changes to a large host of metadata servers which then takes the sent file and pushes it on the backend.  The backblaze pods turn on the drives fill them up and leave them spinning nary rewriting sectors because most of their clients dont overwrite their files.  They make new ones instead.  None of their pods as per their published designs use anything over dual bonded gigabit nics for network connectivity.  Backblaze builds their pods so that the network bandwidth on the pods is their bottleneck so drive performance hardly needs to be breathtaking.  Since their clients are mostly home users with async connects i.e. upload much lower than download individual writes to the pods will be slow on a per transaction basis anyway.    If you put all these factors together i.e. slow writes until the drives fill up chances of a file being rewritten is slim the machine never turns off these are the ideal circumstances on how to employ a mostly writeonce readafewtimes disk backup.  If your middleware handles replication of the data you are good to go.  However thats a usage pattern few people outside of the enduserbackuptodiskoverinternet world would ascribe to.  Even enterprise disksbackups expect disks to be recycled every few months.  I wish Backblaze would remind their blog readers that this is what works for them instead of stating their findings as canonical fact as what is useful for them.   What corners Backblaze find advantageous to cut what to compromise visavis their business plans are great for their corner case but terrible for other users.  ,homelab,ci9nueh,1,t5_2ubz7

Typically you use a tagged port to connect switches together or subinterfaces from a router or firewall thus allowing different networks to be spread across different switches.  Think a multibuilding setup where you need the same  networks in  different buildings.  You would set up your core switch with VLAN   and .  Then set up a tagged port to go to each of the other switches where you can then break out VLANs   and  as needed.I would absolutely ONLY give tagged ports to devices that already support VLAN tagging.  Every enduser device is going to take a untagged port in any kind of business network.  Sometimes a server will need access to multiple networks which can be solved with VLAN tagging but thats about the only end device within reason I could see needing a tagged port.,homelab,ciybeku,1,t5_2ubz7

2094408,0,t1_cl5sdig,If youre really wanting to try new things at work Id suggest trying to get an actual proper lab with a segregated network. Ask for an old switch an old router or maybe put a second NIC in one of those desktops and run pfsense and then either use those desktops or have them splurge on a used server that actually has enough RAM to virtualize stuff. But if a switch and router are free either a decommissioned server or one bought off ebay will only be a few hundred to get a working lab.Why I say get an actual lab? Two fold. One you may mess stuff up and you dont want to take down the actual business. Two if you really are a go getter whoever is your manager should recognize this and want to help you.

You can also run RouterOS on any x machine.Id say it comes down to personal preference as much as anything unless you really need a specific feature one or the other offers. Im not saying youre the same but I see a lot of people bashing RouterOS and saying pfSense is better and does more yet they havent actually tried RouterOS themselves.Edit most RouterBoards have at least five Ethernet ports leaving at four for your LAN. Most pfSense boxes in the same price ranges only have two ports meaning youll probably need a switch too.

You couldnt have onboard RAID running with the PCIe M in passthrough without causing data loss. HP also removed the ability to passthrough in newer versions of VMWare due to RAM issues with the hostVM and causing data corruption.If you use passthrough I would be careful of changes to the host after you verify everything is running smooth.

A typical ohms  watt resistor will  burn if I were to use it on my PowerEdge  fans.To properly find the right resistor use this calculator   and search for the closest resistor resistors come in certain sizes that has that value. Ideally  volts is where you want it but it doesnt have to be exact. Most importantly you want a resistor that can handle a higher wattage than what is being thrown at it. Id say the cermatic square resistors at  and  watts are perfect for server fans as their usually high in amps  amps. The calculator will say how much watts are required.Second thing to note is that since the fans will now report a lower RPM speed than originally the BMC will cycle the fans between high and low speeds. Only a BMC firmware mod to reduce RPM limit will fix this. This is the challenging part if you want to enjoy a nice quiet server at home. This person  does an excellent job in explaining for those who want to try the mod.Yeah its better that people either build their own server if they want an easier route to silencing their server.

3320951,0,t1_cp6somc,I havent done my CCNA yet Im just getting started but heres what Ive learned from starting to build my lab. The current CCNA tests are based on IOS . If you want to buy physical gear which is what Im doing instead of doing it virtually try to get routers that have  already on them.  You can probably learn most of what you need to know on the earlier versions of IOS but there may be some gotchas when you actually try to take the test. The  routers seem to be a favorite for lab building. I chose to buy some s because they werent much more under buy it now and they have some features that would be useful if I ever decide to do CCNA Voice. Be a bit patient there are always routers listed for  on ebay but you can get them for a bit less if you keep an eye out.What I understand from my research is that to be able to create lab exercises that will allow you to get experience and learn the various technologies that are on the test you will need three routers and two or three switches. I am going to purchase managed switches to try to future proof my lab a bit but I dont believe that is necessary for for the CCNA. I believe you can also do most of the learning with two routers and two switches if you had to.Labs can be found online fairly easily no need to buy them somewhere. You can also just do your own thing and learn that way. I also dont recommend getting the CCNA kits because they seem overpriced for what youre getting.It may also be useful to setup something like ESXi or HyperV so you can plug various virtual computers into different segments of the network to see ifhow traffic is flowing. I dont believe its necessary as you should be able to check the routes and where traffic is going from the routers themselves but it might be helpful if you you are a gotta see it kind of learner.Its also entirely possible to do the CCNA in a virtual environment using GNS or Cisco Packet Tracer if you have access to that.,homelab,cp6teyq,3,t5_2ubz7

It doesnt matter what kernel it is you can run whatever distro of Linux you want in a container. Any distro can use whatever kernel and certainly the proxmox kernel. Essentially you will probably just install Ubuntu . LTS in a container and then it will just feel completely like its own dedicated Ububtu box with its own IP and everything which as you probably realize ubuntu is pretty easy to install the latest version of pretty much any linux software.

Lets say youve got a VPS with publiclyroutable IP address a.b.c.d and a machine on your home network listening for HTTP connections on x.y.z.a and you want to be able to serve web pages to random people on the Internet.  On some machine in your home network Id put it on the firewall but thats just me run this command    ssh R x.y.z.a a.b.c.dAs long as this program is running people will be able to point their browsers to  and theyll see pages served from x.y.z.a.  You could use cron or daemontools or something else to make sure its always running.One complication you need to be root to bind to ports below  on the VPS machine which youll probably want to do to forward the commonlyused ones eg .  To get around this you could pop in some firewall mojo to translate port  to some unprivileged port that you can bind to with ssh R.

4583213,0,t3_3d35vs,I realize Im responding to a nearlyweekold post but this is exactly the question I asked myself and heres how I solved it.If youre currently running Server  R as your HyperV host or seriously thinking about upgrading and you can justify dedicating those disks to an array you could just use Storage Spaces on the host to pool all of your disparate storage into a single pool from which you carve out virtual disks no RAID controller needed.I currently do this on a Dell H in a T chassis in my home lab to create a poormans expandable RAID since Dell PERCs dont let you expand them.I have x  TB drives set up in  mirrors which are presented to the HyperV host as  physical disks. Add them to the same storage pool as a simple volume striped and you get what is effectively  TB usable RAID. If I need more space I can inplace upgrade a mirror to bigger disks and then make the extra space available to the storage pool.In your case assuming you dedicated all three disks youd have . TB spanned across all three disks. Now you can carve that up any way you like it. If you run low on space simply add a new bigger disk. The only real problem with the spanned approach is that you cant decommission an existing disk and remove it you have to retire it then create a new thinprovisioned volume that doesnt include it and move all the data from the old volume to the new. Then you can remove the old disk and replace it. If you created a parity volume you can add and remove at will assuming the new disk is bigger but at a cost in storage space.I havent noticed any real performance degradation using Storage Spaces which is essentially virtualized storage but it is presumably slower than using raw storage. I have to imagine though that running it on the host would be leaps and bounds faster than dedicating disks to a VM and then piping that storage back to the host only to run more VMs on it.Edit Math. Ugh.,homelab,ct8bdna,1,t5_2ubz7

Its perfectly stable. Its the default filesystem for OpenSUSE already.Im either going to use Rockstor or Im going to roll my own using Gentoo. I havent decided yet but I know that more than likely I will be using BTRFS.gt re RAID   I also urge you to look at the downsides of RAID . There are a bunch of articles out there but tldr RAID has a risk of massive failure while trying to rebuild during a failure. A lot of people say RAID  is the minimum parity. Alternatively if youre considering a heavy IO workload e.g. VMs you may want to consider a more IOfriendly RAID setup.RAID is my compromise between  and . Everything mission critical will have multiple redundant external backups. A single drive fault tolerance is good enough for me. At first I will probably be running RAID and convert to  as I add drives. Might switch to  or  later down the road once I completely fill the NAS with drives and the storage space hit isnt as severe.gt At least as good as compression  I strongly urge you to spend a couple weeks looking at resource usage for compression vs dedupe. If youre aiming primarily for storage space and not performance it may fit your use case. But theres usually a very significant performance impact for deduplication very large memory lookup tablesIve spent more than a couple weeks looking at this. You can use dedupe and compression together. Theyre not mutually exclusive. Compression requires CPU cycles dedupe requires RAM for the hash tables and CPU cycles for hashing.

You could set up DHCP and static of course for a gateway to be ... if you wanted to. As long as its within the same subnet you can use whatever youd like.. This sounds like a very large flat network. I think you should probably look into using VLANs to get some separation between hosts and reduce the size of your broadcast domains.

6055552,0,t1_cydas2m,ZFS is not particularly CPU hungry and I dont know why that myth persists.  Neither am I limiting this to sequential throughput.  Also Im not sure what CPU you think will do significantly better than that E Xeon E CPUs are some of the fastest CPUs on the planet  significantly faster than their big brother E and Es which have more cores and can address more RAM but are slower percore and perprocess.Lets take a look at a lowly AMD Bulldozer CPU  we can surely agree that a Bulldozer FX is less horsepower than a Xeon E series?    rootvmdatatest fio namerandomwriters ioenginesync iodepth rwrandwrite bsk direct sizem numjobs gtamp | grep aggrb amp sleep   top n | grep Cpu | tail n  sleep     Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id  .wa  .hi  .si  .st    Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id .wa  .hi  .si  .st    Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id .wa  .hi  .si  .st      WRITE io.MB aggrbKBs minbKBs maxbKBs mintmsec maxtmsecOK this RAIDZ vdev four Samsung  Pro GB SSDs is chewing through some challenging random writes  concurrent random K writers and producing about MBsec aggregate bandwidth and around K IOPS.  into the run were really not hurting the CPU too badly  quite a bit of idle time left over there.  Still we are using a healthy chunk of CPU... but oh hey wait weve got LZ compression on.  What if we turn the compression off?    rootvmdatatest fio namerandomwriters ioenginesync iodepth rwrandwrite bsk direct sizem numjobs gtamp | grep aggrb amp sleep   top n | grep Cpu | tail n  sleep     Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id  .wa  .hi  .si  .st    Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id .wa  .hi  .si  .st    Cpus  .us .sy  .ni .id  .wa  .hi  .si  .st      WRITE io.MB aggrbKBs minbKBs maxbKBs mintmsec maxtmsecNotice the CPU now that compression is turned off?   idle.  The CPU is bored.  And again this is a relatively lowly Bulldozer AMD CPU  overall Passmark significantly lower than your Ev and singlethread Passmark which is whats most relevant for what were doing is much lower than your EThis is also a really crappy topology for what were doing here  RAIDZ and K random writes dont really go together.  What happens if we bump up to something a little meaner?  Were going to run the same test now on an Ev system which also has a lower singlethread Passmark than your E btw but this box has a more favorable topology four Samsung  Pro TB SSDs in a pool of mirrors.    rootproddatatest fio namerandomwriters ioenginesync iodepth rwrandwrite bsk direct sizem numjobs gtamp | grep aggrb amp sleep   top n | grep Cpu | tail n  sleep     Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id . wa  . hi  . si  . st    Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id . wa  . hi  . si  . st    Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id . wa  . hi  . si  . st      WRITE io.MB aggrbKBs minbKBs maxbKBs mintmsec maxtmsec MBsec of random K writes right there baby  with the CPUs still almost  idle the whole way through.  Even with the pool of mirrors were bottlenecking on the storage hardware not the CPU as witness the wait in the  range.What if we run some tests that dont hit the storage but can be completed out of the ARC?  Im going to have to do this one a little differently because the fio run completes so quickly that I cant sleep into it.  Im going to have to do my top run concurrently in a separate TTY.    rootproddatatest fio namerandomreaders ioenginesync iodepth rwrandread bsk direct sizem numjobs gtamp | grep aggrb       READ io.MB aggrb.MBs minbKBs maxbKBs mintmsec maxtmsec.GBsec.  Of K random reads!  Admittedly served out of the ARC but hey thats kind of the point here  were at least mostly eliminating storage hardware as a bottleneck.  What did our CPU usage look like?    rootprod top n | grep Cpu    Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id  . wa  . hi  . si  . st    Cpus  . us . sy  . ni . id  . wa  . hi  . si  . st    Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id  . wa  . hi  . si  . st    Cpus  . us  . sy  . ni . id  . wa  . hi  . si  . stOK you can see the second during which the test ran  its the one with only . idle instead of .Are you bored yet?

After that check out Cisco Packet Tracer. Its a good way to get started with labbing without any physical gear. It doesnt have all of the real commands that a real router or switch would have but it has enough to satisfy the CCNA requirements and get your feet wet.  You can also look into GNS which is a good virtualization platform for Cisco gear. This is a step up from Packet Tracer but can be a bit cumbersome to set up.  Lastly if you want the real thing Id recommend you pick up a pair of Cisco  routers and  Cisco  switches.

Then I imported the RAID configuration and booted up it booted to Server  as normal. Downloaded the Dell BIOS updater from their website and ran it. Evidently Dell doesnt have a separate BIOS installer for the GSA than the regular R. I updated the BIOS and then and Im not sure if it was because of the update or the jumper but it cleared the BIOS password and I was able to change the boot order setup iDRAC and all of the regular configuration stuff.So its still on the GSA BIOS so the fans are still a little loud but for now at least it appears to work regularly.

Furthermore no you cannot I repeat cannot rebuilt all the data on the array from just one disk out of a normal parity RAID. If you could by inherently defying some principle laws of physics or using some insane nonexistent compression in your custom RAID implementation we wouldnt even have different levels of parity RAID because we wouldnt need to worry about how many drives we lost since all data could be reconstructed from a single disk.Even if all of these impossibilities aligned and somehow an opponent was able to reconstruct my data from a single disk its still bit AES encrypted and youd need the key or an impossibly expensive supercomputer read quantum computer in order to decrypt the data.Not only is what youre suggesting incorrect but its also ridiculously infeasible and would be ludicrously expensive.

6713988,0,t1_d0dqipb,It might have been a fiber card but Id be willing to bet that he was actually using a Gb Ethernet NIC network interface controller and not a Fibre Channel HBA host bus adapter. Fiber is just a physical media and can be used for a number of different protocols.Some of this might be oversimplified and some might be too complex but here goes...Aside from being conceptually different the actual differences between a SAN and a NAS are really the protocols used and consequently the layers at which they operate in the OSI Model are some graphics for referenceIn essence with a NAS you see the host and youre dealing with files hosted on shares. With a SAN you dont see the host and the disks themselves are the shares presented as something called LUNs. NAS  Shares  Files SAN  LUNs  DisksBoth will require a processor and RAM of some sort however when dealing strictly with disks as you do in a SAN the requirements are typically much lower since all youre really doing is translating commands. This is in reference to a SAN in its most pure state however and some SANs might do other things such as software RAID under the hood and still present a disk to the initiators which can increase these requirements.,homelab,d0ds8ea,1,t5_2ubz7

I ignored the ones telling me that I was an idiot and focused on the positive responses. I learnt about Pluralsight about various books about projects I could do to learn.Today I am still a novice but Ive created a variety of small apps that run on my PC. Apps that connect to twitter and post things. Web apps that store millions of records a day in Azure Tables  and search that table in seconds. A little Windows Phone app for my contacts.

I read that tunneling it through ssh is better due to the relatively weak encryption of the rdp protocol. I guess my question was more if the fact that my linux server is exposed to the internet mattered. Even if I am only forwarding port  on my router does it matter that all other ports on the linux server are open? As in in this situation would it be more secure in any way to set up iptables to block all other ports? That is is my network more exposed than it would be if I only allowed port  forwarding in iptables?I am a newbie to networking and still have a lot to learn about it conceptually I am just trying to get some practical tasks done in the meantime.I guess the problem is conceptually I dont know what a potential attacker could do with the fact that port  is forwarded to this server and how the servers firewall settings matter in this case.,homelab,d14zupy,1,t5_2ubz7

Originally was looking at a C but heard they were loud and finicky sometimes then was looking at a R only really need  bays then looking at a R with . bays now I actually just got done sending a message to someone about a R they have available they are asking more than I want to pay for a storage server but it has a pair of hex cores so asked if the would drop the price if I didnt want those the ram or the perc card. Also took a look at the idea of grabbing a R some cheap barebones in eBay for like  and attaching a disk shelf to it internal . bays would be used for fast SSD or SAS storage and then enclosure would hold my larder disks for mass storage of media etc. So spent quite a few hours looking at storage solutions myself.As for suggestions Id have to understand your lab a little better for the price you are going to pay for most disk shelves you could probably pick up another server that would suit your needs Ive seen Rs posted for cheap DL  Gs that support  drives for really cheap.If it were me since the servers you have are so old I would be looking for something that would suit your needs and possibly be able to replace one of them. The DL s can be found for  with a  series and some ram and an okay raid controller that will support your TB drive idea.Just thinking power savings alone would make it worth the extra  over something like the disk enclosure you posted. Power from both the diskshelf and the server it could technically replace. Just my thoughts tho.,homelab,d1kepf5,1,t5_2ubz7

The referenced document is from the WASHINGTON STATE PATROL  FIRE PROTECTION BUREAU INSPECTION SECTION and entitled Electrical Wiring and EquipmentIt begins The leading cause of fires in Licensed Care Facilities my emphasis is electrical wiring and equipment. Electrical wiring and equipment shall be in accordance with NFPA  National Electrical Code. ... The rest of the document notes common violations of the code.Two instances are highlighted at the beginning Extension Cords and Daisy Chaining. The first references NEC .. Uses Not Permitted which in part saysgt .. Unless specifically permitted in . flexible cordsgt and cables shall not be used for the followinggtgt  As a substitute for the fixed wiring of a structuregt ...So theyre trying to maintain safe permanent conditions. I guess I can go along with that. If they applied that same standard strictly a large number of home and business owners would get a ticket. Chalk one up for selective enforcement.Note that the final clause  Where subject to physical damage could be interpreted pretty broadly.Regarding Daisy Chaining it cites section .. Uses Permitted which readsgt B Attachment Plugs. Where used as permitted in .Agt A and A each flexible cord shall be equipped with angt attachment plug and shall be energized from a receptacle outletgt or cord connector body. ROP The outlet strips have an attachment plug and multiple receptacles. Daisy chaining outlet strips involves installing an attachment plug from the second outlet strip into a receptacle of the first outlet strip. This meets the requirement  I dont think this would hold up in court or an administrative hearing.  Other parts of the code cover acceptable current carrying ability ampacity of the cordage but they are not referenced in the document. I dont expect they would issue a citation for overloading because that would require expert opinion.Nonetheless it is likely that overloading is the biggest risk and they are attempting to avoid it indirectly.I wonder what the home insurance company says about outlet strips? It could be a lot more impactful than the Fire Marshal.edit add tldr daisy chaining outlet strips is not a violation in WA state. that does not mean you can avoid using common sense.,homelab,d1zfvuv,2,t5_2ubz7

7295538,0,t1_d27dduu,Our biggest issue with OCP is that it was just as expensive as other vendors  HP IBM Dell Supermicro etc. OCP works costwise at massive scale andor when you manufacture them direct. That is what Facebook does. Otherwise you go to what is in effect a reseller Quanta Penguin Amax and buy a branded OCP node that they had built and put a sticker on. We have several hundred Winterfell nodes that well eventually abandon. Our new builds are on Cisco UCS. We used OCP for a while because it was cool. Literally. The Clevels wanted to use it because it was neat and good advertising which is a fantastic way to make technical decisions.I have to assume that any used or even NIB on the secondary market come with a similar story. I cant imagine someone like Riot being able to make the financials work. I doubt theyre in the tens or hundreds of thousands of severs market. Reliabilitywise the gear has been OK. The nodes we have dont have onboard video so without a discreet card or other tools you have to pull the node and install one to crash cart it.

7683833,0,t3_4kjyrt,For best practices youre best off consulting VMWares documentation on that but here is my two cents from running this setup for a few years now.I use iSCSI for my main datastores though I do have a couple NFS datastores I use for accessing ISOs from the hosts and doing backups. I run Gbe two ports per host. No jumbo frames no LACP. If youre running gbe links and are expecting to see bandwidth above gbps from a single guest youll want to adjust the round robin iops limit from the default of  to something lower like . Youll see this documented all over the place. In regards to NFS its not ESXi thats hampering the performance its zfs. zfs has a double write penalty for synchronous writes and all writes from NFS are synchronous by default. You can of course adjust that in a variety of ways keeping in mind there is the opportunity for data loss. Speaking of which ESXi will not automatically flush writes on iSCSI devices and so if you wish to have absolute write guarantees you will want to set sync to always on the backing zfs filesystem or zvol. That said Ive been using nonsynced iSCSI for the entire time with plenty of power outages kernel panics and all manner of scenarios for data loss and if Ive lost data I sure cant tell. No VMs corrupted etc.There is a lot to cover in either setup if you have specific questions Id be happy to answer them.,homelab,d3flryr,6,t5_2ubz7

7899668,0,t1_d43jwya,The controllers are not completely independent they are linked by the backplane. If the backplane goes so does your SAN. And again the configuration itself is a single point of failure. If you mess up the configuration or it gets corrupted it is then replicated to the other controller in some cases. Your argument seems to be my house has never burned down so why would I buy insurance?gt Next often that kind of redundancy introducing a nd SAN and some methodology to duplicate the data AND failover to it adds another failure point and likely WILL be your failure point.I agree entirely. This is ultimately why we went back to local storage with proper backups for production. That and the cost to add an SSD tier to a SAN is outrageous.Just like RAID is not backup neither are the HA claims of SANs. In the case of the two hypervisors each running  VMs Id have a third identically speced machine running backup software that meets the companies RTO and RPO objectives. For example Veeam can have an RPO as low as  minutes and an even shorter RTO since you can boot the VM directly from the backup without moving any data. For our use case this is acceptable. CDP backup exists if you can not afford to loose any data.Now compare the complexity cost and failure domains of the two solutions. On the one hand  independent commodity servers. On the other a proprietary SAN that almost certainly requires HDDsSSDs with blessed firmware much more complicated networking and a single point of failure. As I mentioned in another response I dont understand the argument that local storage does not scale. You can daisy chain  DASes for  x  x . or  x  x . drives or any combination. Not to mention RXDs and newer and their many bays as an example.Regardless the point is moot in my mind. Hyper Converged replaces many of the SAN use cases that require  down time like your example of running very expensive equipment. ,homelab,d43zw2s,2,t5_2ubz7

Im also realizing that I can no longer get away with my absolutely shameful level of knowledge about networking. My recent network upgrade made that painfully obvious.  Most of my day yesterday was spent fighting with my new ERL and Switch. By the grace of the networking gods Ive managed to cobble things together to work but part of the problem is I cant be  certain I know WHY they work. Lots of studying and breakingfixing things to come.  From top to bottom L to R  Mac Mini igbssd  Server OS X Does SonarrCPNZBGetPMSUnifi ControllerCrashplan.  ISP Supplied Cisco DPC. Bridged  pipe.  TB WD Mybook Nightly backup of highest importance files on NAS.  QNAP PII. Starting to show its age but its been up for a good couple years straight. XTB Red RAID.   ERL. Were still getting to know either other and the first date didnt go well.  Netgear GST  The only special thing this is doing is LACP for the NAS for now. Im still very scared of it.    I also setup a UAPPro yesterday. So far so good. Was the least scary thing I did this weekend.  Not Pictured Cyberpower LCD UPS under the desk.  All in all the recent upgrades have been a great learning experience. I mostly learned I cant get away with SOHO knowledge if I want to use SMBEnterprise products and sit at the big kids table. But I am really happy with where the lab is at its clean functional and does exactly what I need it to do. It hangs well below W most of the time. The great thing now is that I have a lot of room to grow. Thanks for reading Is there a goto networking resource that you all learned from?

8619286,0,t3_4xvyzz,Its not a bad choice for a NAS actually but if you can find a DL  G for a similar price you might be better off just because then it gives you room for expansion down the line.I ran a R as a FreeNAS box for a couple of months and it was rock solid but as soon as I wanted to increase my storage the  bays was a major limiting factor also in my case the raid card was limited to TB drives and I only have one expansion slot. The DL is a little better off because even if you need more space you can always add something like a MSA  diskshelf attached with an external sas card and still have an extra half height slot for an additional nic or something like that if you needed.My only concern would be noise since I dont have one I cant give you any ideas on how loud it would be my Rs are actually on the quiet side but I still wouldnt want to sleep near them. Dont let everyone use the its a u server so its loud as a jet taking off if you can afford it then it will definitely work for you and for that price its really not that bad.

I cant see the writing on it but its got what looks like an X or Xenpack module on top and a TwinGig converter module with two SFPs in it on the bottom. If thats what I think it is then thats a port E which means  gigabit ports and a pair of X GbE ports. As far as selling it value depends on whether its a WSCETDS or a WSCETDE model. A TDS will probably be in the  range whereas a TDE might go for  more. From a lab standpoint its a gigabit Cisco switch with G ports available. Even if you wanted to swap out the pair of SFPs for another X theyre only  tops. Not quite as cheap as maybe a DACTwinax cable would be but an X SFP for your NIC and a meter or two of multimode is cheap enough.,homelab,d6ryten,3,t5_2ubz7

The Lxxs are hex core models which if its in the budget would be better to get then the Lxx model as thats a quad core. As far as an OS you have several things you wish to accomplish and none of them can run from a single entity unless you use Windows server  a hyperV role....but that limits you as well FreeNAS is not a hypervisor and would only be able to run pluginsjails which doesnt allow for pfsensedockers etc.Best course of action is ESXi the free license for ESXi will give you enough to get started for virtualizing things that will allow you to in the future create a FreeNAS VM and then pass through a HBA to the drives you plan to use. FreeNAS does not like starting with  drives and then adding another  at a time until you reach where you want to be FreeNAS rather start out with however many drives you plan to have from the getgo and then go from there or start small buy the right amount of drives you need and then create a new pool from there and move the data over.Theres no real easy way to do everything you need to do however there are many of us here that can certainly help you accomplish your goals. TLDR Theres no one and done solution for everything you want to do typically its virtualize the hell out of everything and go from there. ,homelab,d786hq7,2,t5_2ubz7

All three are viable options  Ive done them all.Provided you go with  youre going to need something to install Server on. You can do it in a VM on a laptop or desktop but thats pretty janky. Server really wants to host its own DNS and DHCP and you dont want to be playing CoD on the same machine thats running youre network. Its also nice to have some network segregation so changes made on your AD domain dont interrupt Netflix. So a separate machine is in order.That machine can be some piece of junk you pull out of the trash or a complete rack of hot and loud awesomesauce just depending on your budget goals and sense of overkill. Make sure you install HyperV with your copy of Server. This allows you to install both a copy of Server and a couple of regular Windows machines to act as clients to test your GPOs and whatnot on as well as stuff like WDS and all the other fun parts of Server all without sacrificing multiple machines to do it.How in depth you want to get is up to you.

Sure you wont be able to make full use of a SATA III drive now but youre not limiting yourself to future upgrades.Drive capacity doesnt really matter as long as all drives are the same size for a traditional RAID setup. Again just figure out what you can afford. IMHO you would be fine with just about any modern drive as long as you ensure the drive is not being spun down and back up a ton. The spin updown cycle is stressful on a drive and doing it a lot will reduce its life span.I think the most important thing you need to consider is how you are going to establish the RAID setup.

Perhaps that is because at first I had only two out of four nic connected. Got to findout why it is still not using all four paths.Anyhow I tried cloning VM that was already on this iSCSI datastore to the same iSCSI datastore and it completed in about a minute. VM size is about GB. I do not know if this is good or bad but more testing will be done tomorrow.Edit After rescanning iscsi storage adapter on each host I got  paths to active. I have also changed datastore setting to RoundRobin. Initial VM cloning from QNAP to iSCSI seems to have taken slightly less time but might be just me. Cloning VM that is already on iSCSI datastore to same datastore took only  seconds according to task log. Also small correction VM size is GB not GB. Since this datastore appears as if it was block level device is there some trickery going on in background that doesnt fully make a copy?

You would still be oversubscribing the link but it is unlikely to cause problems unless you have more than  people moving gigabit constantly. In that case you could do LACP for those gbit ports but I would call that rather rare cases to need that much bandwidth for now.

If youre using FreeNAS or unRAID Id forget doing any sort of hardware RAID  let the nas OS take care of that for you.  Since the board youve selected doesnt seem to have two SATA controllers you could pick up a cheap nonRAID SATA PCIe controller.  I believe both Dells PERC line and whatever HP calls their controllers both have a nonRAID card in the lineup and Im sure someone more familiar with said cards can chime in to give you a model or two to look for.

10548622,0,t1_dd3rdnm,I dont know first thing that came to my mind was a google doc or google forms never used google forms but I think it would work. gtadd a device Also the specs of the device probably most important is the number of processors and hard drives and Power supplies. For example I have a R but it has  quad core Procs and  drives. Comparing that to another R with  quad core and  drive. would give you much different results because the other R would have significantly lower power usage just because it has less things to power. gtand add average kWh load or just watt reading at a particular time of day?That is a hard one. I would think we would want at least  reading standardized that is easy and can be duplicated on any server. Say something like power usage when in the BIOS. This way we are not dealing with OS issues or any unexpected server load that could change the results.  But I wouldnt be opposed to other readings as well like kWh under a stress test or average kWh load normal usage.  We just need to remember this would vary based on use case. Your average load is probably different then my average load. So people need to be made aware results may vary. But it would give people a good idea what to expect for power usage. That is basically what we want. ,homelab,dd3syuu,1,t5_2ubz7

It now lives under the stairs where I had to remove some of the doorframe to move it into place.Have a look for Middle Atlantic rack equipment some of their stuff is lovely and really well made sliding frames etc and can be had for reasonable sums especially if you want to make some customfit rack too.Data racks generally sell for more than AV racks IMO.Next task is to install a cooling fan so I can shut the door but thats another story for another day.,homelab,ddevyrx,2,t5_2ubz7

So the switch will happily just strip off the VLAN tags from any packets it receives on those VLANs before it passes them on to the other ports.  Although in most cases I dont think it makes sense to do this but it can be done.Theres a different setting I cant remember what its called to set what the default outbound VLAN is for a specific port inbound to the switch. And there you can obviously only have  default outbound VLAN set. All other outbound traffic must be properly tagged or it will end up on the default VLAN.,homelab,ddhzhq8,1,t5_2ubz7
10689863,0,t3_5sw8ab,Id be inclined to say that reliability is an advantage not a disadvantage of building your own server. You get to get excellent quality of everything if you choose. Do you think Dell gives you well balanced highly efficient reliable power supplies with their servers? Hell no. Youll get what they give you and youll like it!There are lots of people who really like their prebuild Dell and HP machines but there are also plenty of people whod go in other directions. Personally I like MSi for low power physically small AMD systems and Supermicro for Intel.In my experience both Dell and HP suck when it comes to quality. Its just that they suck slightly less than other things which might be why so many people like them. Also they seem to be common enough that theyre relatively cheap for slightly older models.  But if I wanted real reliability I would NEVER choose Dell or HP.The other reasons that people point out here are important to some but not others. Sure if you want to learn how iDRAC works sure get something with it. Id never use it for any reason but some people like it.rhomelab is about setting up a facsimile of an enterprisey environment so if you want to do that get the same thing that many people here get. If you want to run a server and that takes precedence over playing with it to learn about Dells and HPs proprietary junk then build a good one using good parts yourself.

10714928,0,t1_ddjxc6f,Id personally go with slower TDP since they should use less power. That depends though on how much your electricity is and if thats a concern. At .kw  watts per month costs just under . So  watts is roughly  a year. Ive never run into CPU contention although I can tell changing from my i .Ghz to a L.Ghz did have a bit of slow down on my desktop but didnt notice anything in VMs. Unless you know youre doing CPU intense stuff I wouldnt worry about CPU speed. Lately Ive been more focused on keeping power usage low. If youre in a warm climate not only will you need more power for the server but youll be running a  watt mini space heater depending on what you get thatll be counteracting AC cold climate isnt such a big deal.These benchmarks dont show a whole lot of difference between the E and X. Keep in mind newer CPUs are generally able to do more per clock cycle than older CPUs so a newer Ghz is most definitely faster than a older Ghz.In addition Id wager that a server coming with a newer gen CPU has more upgradability since it will likely also support older CPUs but an older MB might not support newer CPUs even with a BIOS update. Someone else may be able to comment on this more though.Also dont forget about TCO aside from just up front cost. As mentioned power is definitely a concern if its not free for you. Something with more efficient CPUsPSUs or easier to find replacement parts will cost less over time. It may be  more for something up front that supports . drives instead of . but you may save  in getting cheaper . drives after youve bought a few.,homelab,ddl5yde,1,t5_2ubz7

10932219,0,t1_de7flon,Im in the UK and Ive not been homelabbing long. I just bought a HP Proliant DL G for  with a couple of small drives and a modest amount of RAM. I thought that was a pretty good deal. The Dell PowerEdge RR servers are also highly recommended on rhomelab. The problem I found when I was looking for a server was the RRs arent as readily availableas cheap as they are in the US so I got a HP G. The GGs can be found on eBay for a decent price in the UK. This is what I felt your mileage may vary. A mistake I made when first starting out was buying an old server or two that were very cheap. Case in point was the Dell PowerEdge  amp . I have since sold them. They were extremely loud and used a lot of electric. If you plan on running something  power usage is something that you will want to factor into your purchase.I bought from this seller FYI systemsupplyindustriesltd and I was very pleased with my purchase. Where are you planning on keeping your new homelab? If you plan on keeping your server in a bedroom you will need to think about noise. My G is quiet enough that I can have it on my desk next to me. Except for when I reboot it and then it does make a racket for about a minute and calms down again. If you ever want to chat about this stuff. Feel free to PM me whenever.

What I ended up getting was a Dell R which is pretty much the prototypical rhomelab home server. Theres good reason for that I found! Its got a nice balance of features and performance while not being too loud. Also there are a few different configurations you get to choose from. I saw that you found one on Newegg which is fine but truthfully its unlikely to be much better than buying from ebay when its in a usedrefurbished condition. Also I dont feel like the one you posted will suit your needs as much as another R could.The only specific requirement you have it sounds like is energy efficiency. In that case Id narrow your search to Rs that have L CPUs in them thats gonna be either the L or L. The L denotes that it is a lowpower CPU at least thats my understanding of it. More important to me than the lower power consumption is the fact that it makes less noise.I found this listing on ebay which will probably serve you better out of the box. Dual Ls means  logical cores available to you x cores x  threads per core with hyperthreading with reasonable power consumption. It also comes with xTB drives that you could RAID into a redundant array. GB of memory should be enough for you to get quite a bit running but used ECC memory for these servers is dirt cheap. I upgraded mine from GB to GB for about .I run about  VMs on my server without any capacity issues and thats using Ls which are only  cores apiece so youll have nothing to worry about.Let me know if I can clarify anything for you!,homelab,df5goy1,2,t5_2ubz7

I guess if youre not running it in the winterwhen its cold in the attic. Still... I recognize the need to go the baling wire and duct tape route to get things fixed in a pinch. But having that mentality all the time especially when it comes to your house is... well I just dont understand it and find it annoying because Ive had to fix the results of that type of thinking. For example Im currently working on redoing the electrical in my shop because the previous owner thought it would be ok to run  to it using  feeder wire. That means that they used the bare ground wire as the neutral. And do you know why they did it this way? Because they had the  feeder already and could not be bothered to buy the correct wire for the job I happen to know this cause the previous owners are my inlaws.To be clear Im not talking about achieving perfection. I just think that one should strive to do things at least minimally correct rather than just throwing their hands up and declaring it a lost cause because the last guy didnt bother to do it right.

I walked into a local retail shop and walked out with a nice and fun job.  That lasted a few years.  At home I was running com switches ISDN internal IPv Linux Shoutcast Unreal Tournament server Half life server BBphp.  I got my first corporate windows desktop and SGI Irix job.  That job lasted a year before corporate shut the site down.  I was able to be cool enough and talk about technology enough to get into a SaaS wasnt a word back then app company.  I was there  years. I learned a shit load.  Im still friends with a lot of people from that company.  I bounced around every year or two for awhile gathering a bunch of experience.  Worked at Swiss Banks and  person SaaS shops and everything in between.  Im now at Red Hat with a very well established career.  Today when we interview someone we talk niceties for a few minutes then get to it.  We ask for your GitHub account and throw it up on the big screen.  This weeds out    people for various reasons.  We go through code and repo commits.  We get a clear understanding of how a person works and why a person is doing a block of work.  The team can then have a post interview meeting and give a data backed point for various aspects of the candidate.  Of course the candidate with the most points wins.   I love our process.  Its fun.

And also this is for reference only you need to the get the right one for your controller.  Im guessing yours is an LSI MM but again they come is various flavors.,homelab,dgtxlub,1,t5_2ubz7
11774676,0,t3_680b21,VSphere does not require a RAID card but if you would like to put  drives in RAID you will need one. Whithout asking too many specifics what exactly are you running at work on VSphere? Web servers? AD? File servers? Remote Desktop? Monitoring software? etc.   You can always start with some monitoring software like LibreNMS and a directory server Server  with AD. Throw a couple of clients on there and start learning how they work with AD. I hope that your CPU isnt the celeroni model though. ,homelab,dgup0d3,3,t5_2ubz7
11774838,0,t1_dgumdgm,Thats the reason the rig is on wheels. I can move it out of my room into a cooler area of the house. Less noise too while I study. Power wise the entire rack is converged is around  watts. Which when you think about it coupled with the fact I run a Laptop. Its about what a decent desktop machine  monitor uses at idle not including running GNS. ,homelab,dgupobh,2,t5_2ubz7

11779257,0,t1_dguynp3,Ive never been a huge fan of Xpenology. While I love the idea of it it always felt somewhat hacky to me.  I mean in my testing I was able to completely nuke my Xpenology array just by setting jumbo frames on one of the network interfaces.With it being that easy to break I found it difficult to trust my data with it.  ,homelab,dgv7sp2,1,t5_2ubz7

11793675,0,t1_dgwu29m,Ive had a few unfortunate occasions to use powershell and it is mediocre at best. Sorry to burst your bubble but Microsoft products are terrible and probably always will be. The only barrier to entry is cost not knowledge. For all the money you pay for them you should expect a far superior offering to some free community products. Let me know when you hit the ceiling it seems to be near in your future. I completely intended to be disrespectful to Microsoft not to you but now that you mention being in the industry for over  years and have never used Exchange I would say your experience is a bit limited and you might be naive to the world of Windows.,homelab,dgwupoz,-17,t5_2ubz7
11793833,0,t1_dgwva5c,Not really theyre both pretty simple processes however I recommend flashing the card or crossflashing the M on DOS if you can or you have a older PC that isnt UEFI I find it easier ,homelab,dgwvcx4,2,t5_2ubz7
