Theyre located on the top cam cover right next to the timing sprockets. Other than that its going to be either the pcv oil cap seal or either front or main seals. I didnt want to say this for fear of causing bad luck but could also be a head gasket. Oil cap seals fail a lot especially in areas with high ambient temperatures. Pcv can crack because of heat and neglect.If its none of those is the oil coming down the front or the back of the motor?

The price before coupon was .. If people want to know I can dig up the certificate and let you know how much of an improvement it made. Edit Polestar is a division of Volvo. Having your car tuned by Polestar IN NO WAY voids any Volvo warranty. And when they tune your car you get those tuning parameters entered into Volvos worldwide database. So if you ever go in and get your chips software upgraded they just look at the database and write back your performance parameters after upgrading.

2562419,0,t1_cmqgjoy,Im not driving it like a sports car so Ive never needed a lot more power though I could always use a little bit extra . I came from driving a  wagon so this is more than ample power for me. Ive also never driven it outside the state so I cant compare it to driving at sea level. I can say that I drive it up some of the steepest and highest highways in the country and Im always passing SUVs and coupes without the turbos. Its a blast to drive and always inspires confidence. My only complaint besides the fact that its not a wagon is that the electronic throttle is not really responsive. Makes zipping in and out of traffic difficult. But its a great cruising car. I guess I could sum it up by saying that the car might be slower up here than at sea level but it almost certainly suffers way less than naturally aspirated cars in the altitude. Guh.

I picked up the part at Volvo for  something dollars shop price cause I used to work at my buddies shop. Takes around hrs to change taking it slow and chatting but not a difficult change.

Disconnect the turn signal remove it and inspect the bulb socket and electrical contacts for corrosion.

The trick will be finding where it is!Disconnect the battery before doing anything.I recommend pulling all  brake light bulbs and checking to make sure they and the holders in good condition. It could be although unlikely that one of them has failed in such a way as to short your brake circuit. If so its easy to check and fix.You may find however that you have a wiring problem  one of the hot nonground wires in the circuit is connecting to the body of the car or other grounded point and shorting out. The first place to check is the tailgate wiring harnesses where they pass through the hinge  they often wear out due to the opening and closing of the tailgate. That part can be gotten cheap off IPD if it is worn out and is fairly easy to spot.Otherwise you may have to locate the offending wire with a multimeter. ,Volvo,cs04tia,7,t5_2qr4g

4470343,0,t1_csu46z5,I just replaced everything in there on my S same basic procedure so I cant comment about cleaning. I would say you want ramps because there was a bolt that is only accessible from underneath.  can be done from above the car so its not a huge ordeal. I ended up tearing everything out again to replace a knock sensor so Ive actually done the whole dance twice in the last couple years. Take your time keep up with all the bolts in the manifold and it will eventually come out. If yours has that one underneath like mine you will need a good  or better extension to get at it. Also notice that some of the bolts go through and some are seat on ushaped openings. You dont actually have to remove all of them just a few of them and all of them are fairly easy to get to with a universal and a short socket.Be sure and clean the intake surfaces very well before you put your new gasket on with a knife and brake cleaner and using a teeny tiny dab of grease on the corners will help hold it in place while you get everything lined up and put the bolts back in.

It generally feels effortless as in I cant tell Im driving a  lb vehicle with the aerodynamics of a mobile home. It feels very nimble even though the turning radius in on the larger side. One thing to keep in mind is that as it is an  year old vehicle a lot of the rubber components are starting to go.

All of that is completely normal and if youre getting one that hasnt had all of those replaced which at .k I think you should be youll be needing to take care of that sooner rather than later.

Furthermore make sure you have the car inspected before purchase by somebody who is familiar with Volvos or at least European cars in general.The window issue could be something as simple as needing some silicone spray on the seals or as involved as a new window regulator  to have a shop do it. AC issues can quickly become very expensive depending upon whats wrong. You can easily rack up a bill of  to have major parts of the AC system replaced in a shop. People on Craigslist always downplay AC issues and say oh its just a small leak when in reality it is typically something more than that.There is a saying within the Mercedes community that there is nothing more expensive than a cheap Mercedes.

You can adjust the mileage number shorter or longer depending on your driving conditions.Most important thing on these cars besides tires and brakes like any car is condition of the PCVOil trap and the condition of the timing belt. Look up on google how to check oil trapPCV and youll find a million answers to that. As for the timing belt if you dont know when it was last changed go ahead and replace it. This is an interference engine so if that belt snaps its extremely likely that youll fuck the engine up and end up with repairs that are worth more than the cost itself IF its even repairable within reason at that point. Front suspension components like struts upper spring seats control arms sway bars get fucked at around k miles so those may need some replacing.If you have a  seater then the rear shocks are Nivomat Selfleveling and are very expensive so be aware of that.Enjoy the car!

10484546,0,t3_5q19bj,The coolant system is closed system and requires a good bleed when you replace something. Theres always going to be some air in the system when you replace the heater core radiator or a hose. The system has a jiggle pin on top of the thermostat to prevent air locks and normalize pressure but large air gaps typically do not show up till you run some RPM to get the water pump flowing.  It is required to cycle through a good RPM range when you are completed with the replacement of those system parts to work out any air that is left back to the reservoir. When coolant cools it will condense and you might have to add some then too as the level can drop further than the minimum the previous day.  I think youll work out all your air with in the week. ,Volvo,dcwj63i,1,t5_2qr4g

What kind of transmission do you want to use? Auto or manual? Do you have the skills or a shop that can fabricate engine and gearbox mounts? There are a lot of things to plan before starting the build.

10779578,0,t1_ddrtp5h,Right I never knew that about the later vrs the lines just look so familiar. Yeah I live in Australia so have similar issues with heat. I will have to invest in the kit i think. Anyway you answered my next question which was about the origins of those wheels I very rarely see them. edit Just saw your edit! I am actually going to give them a light sanding back and just paint them black. I considered the heat gun but was too keen to spray them after seeing it done on one at a volvo meetup I went to recently. Anyway best of luck with your brick! ,Volvo,ddru2ro,1,t5_2qr4g

11560402,0,t3_64vu93,The UEMUpper Electronic Module is the rear view mirror. Unfortunately there is no fix except to program a new one or if it is a Volvo part the new mirror you installed. The UEM controls the interior lights sunroof siren remotes and a few minor other items. It is considered a minor module compared to other modules in your vehicle but try telling that to someone who has to pay the price tag for fixing it. I know with us it is  to program a new module. If you replaced it with a generic rear view mirror then you will have to buy a new Volvo part if you bought a Volvo rear view mirror already then you all you have to do is have it programmed.,Volvo,dg6djnx,1,t5_2qr4g

Does the condition occur under certain sitting circumstances AKA nose uphill or downhill. It needs to be scanned with ViDA regular scanners wont tell you what you need. Timing being off will throw those codes as well as a failing crank sensor.I ask these questions because my first V developed a leak into cyl  that would only leak when it was parked nose up a hill. The car would run rough for about  seconds until all the coolant burned out and then run fine. Nose down no symptoms ever. ,Volvo,dgvwpi7,2,t5_2qr4g
