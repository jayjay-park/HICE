5561691,0,t3_3r7bui,I feel like categorizing him as a serial killer is a stretch. I could be wrong but I think that serial killers need the intent to murder not just kill. Like Gosnell killed cause his job was abortion if the baby were born alive kill it. Not saying thats OK but just the thought process he may have had. Dahmer and Gacy killed cause they loved to kill people. I feel like theres a difference. I would have liked to hear more about the fetuses feet and what he claimed the explanation was or what the people working there thought about that. ,SwordScale,cwmh8gs,3,t5_34n7f

It seemed that every  minutes or so I would have to pause to kind of collect myself and process what was going on.  Fucking haunting,SwordScale,cwxz48q,1,t5_34n7f
