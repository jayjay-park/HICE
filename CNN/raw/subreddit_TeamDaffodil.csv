7278186,0,t3_4f2hx1,Ive had days were Im particularly ravenous out of no where likely hormone related but they honestly dont occur often enough for me to take appropriate note of any correlation to that time of the month.. so I can sympathize a bit. My questions for you to try to gain some insight and possibly help are whats your water intake whats your sleep schedule look like and what are your usual macros? Without those pieces of information though I can extend a guess that you may need to listen to your body and increase your calories a tad bit more. Id try  a big cheat day then resume  calsday or  increase to  calsday while youre still following this intense exercise routine. The thing about plateaus is that they will eventually break if you continue to eat under maintenance the rules of thermodynamics demands it. I know its extremely frustrating but definitely do not lose heart. This is character building time heh ,TeamDaffodil,d25hbzu,2,t5_3dw9v
7279861,0,t3_4f2hx1,I went through something very similar late last year and it sucked. I bounced up and down between lb for about two or three months despite having very high activity levels and being very restrictive on the calorie intake. I finally broke through since the start of  and Im back to making progress. Here are a few changes I made and you might tryCheck your math. If youre only eating  calories per day and youre running km per week that should be generating a huge calorie deficit. I was trying to do the same thing and it wasnt working because I was cheating on the calories. An extra  calories here and there might not seem like a big deal but it adds up especially if you end up having a cheat meal or cheat day or cheat week which can totally wipe out your calorie deficit. Now I tell myself I have to log everything its ok if I go over my calorie limits but I absolutely have to log it. The act of logging keeps me from having big cheats.Reevaluate your goals. When I started to lose weight I was aiming to lose kg per week but after pleatuting I adjusted that to .kg per week. That meant eating more. I felt like I had a lot more energy both mentally and physically it was easier to maintain the smaller calorie deficits and I saw big improvements in running performance. Plus Im actually able to stick to that and now the scale is moving in the right direction.Eat more frequently. I know a calorie is a calorie but I switched from eating three meals a day to five and it made a big difference. Instead of breakfastlunchdinner I have a morning meal around AM midmorning meal around AM midday meal around PM afternoon meal around PM and then an evening meal around PM. Since each meal is smaller I dont feel as full after eating and since the meals are closer together Im not as hungry at each meal.Watch the carbs. I love starchy carbs but they just dont fill me up. I could easily eat a whole loaf of bread and be hungry again in a few hours. I started paying more attention to carbs and I feel like that helped a lot. I certainly dont eat a lowcarb diet but I guess I would call it carbconscious. For one I dont eat added sugarhigh fructose corn syrup I think that stuff is just pure garbage zero nutritional value. When I do eat starchy carbs I make sure that theyre paired with fat and protein and fiber. For example instead of spaghetti and marinara sauce try tomato soup with some noodles similar ingredients and flavors but a different proportion of macros.I know the plateau sucks and its easy to lose motivation when it seems like nothings working but if you figure out whats holding you up and fix it Im sure youll get back on track!,TeamDaffodil,d25o6t0,2,t5_3dw9v

7388923,0,t3_4gcxok,The interteam challenge has been really motivating me! Ive been aiming for getting to the gym three times a week but knowing that we can log our exercise minutes has been pushing me to do more workouts outside of the gym. Ive made time for a workout in some form every day since the challenge was posted! Woo hoo!,TeamDaffodil,d2i2j5b,1,t5_3dw9v

7682092,0,t3_4k9gx6,Im so frustrated my weight keeps jumping around.  The scale hasnt moved much in a few weeks so on Wednesday I weighed myself on the fancy digital scale at the gym and it was .!  Thats almost  pounds less than my scale at home!  Home scale must be busted I guess so I resolved only to trust the gym scale.  Today I go to the gym weigh in expecting to see something like that aaaaaand.... ..  Thats half a pound less than last week so I guess its still a loss but its still soooo frustrating.  Im eating at a deficit and working out so I know its got to be water weight or the weight on Wednesday was a fluke.  I dont know.  Grr.,TeamDaffodil,d3fenz9,1,t5_3dw9v
