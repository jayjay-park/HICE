232244,0,t3_1wo9a3,Hey hey! Im a full time trader and see these kinds of patterns all the time. In uptrending stocks they are generally bullish in my experience but like others have said it is how you trade them that matters. You can trade a break of the triangle w a stop under support or a break of support w a stop over the triangle trendline.  From a psych perspective it makes sense...a stock drives up and up and up then sellers start to take profit which drops the price a bit soon more buyers who missed the first push come in and prop it back up but there are more sellers who held through the first sell point and now want to get out. This cycle continues until the pattern coils up very tightly volatility dies down and buyers outweigh the sellers at which point we see a big influx of volume and another thrust upward. Of course it is not foolproof like anything in investing the support could crack and the stock could reverse but if it does then you simply short it and make money going the other way. Either way works but IMO it is generally a bullish pattern when in an uptrending stock especially if it is after a large volatile move.Here are some examples of charts I have actually traded over the last few years. These are all intraday patterns but I have seen this pattern hundreds of times on daily weekly and monthly timeframes as well in uptrending stocks and its usually an indication that the stock is consolidating for another leg up and also note FWRD short was a descending triangle that broke to the downside just as an example that it can go either way!,StockMarket,cf4tk0v,3,t5_2qjuv

570427,0,t3_20nm4c,You could live a very simple life.To generalize heavily you can be long options or a seller of options. Being long allows you to have tremendous gains. My last trade was  return in two hours. However unless you have a very good edge you should expect to loose money more often than not I was prepared for a  loss.Most professional option traders that I know are sellers its what I do primarily. Its not unheard of to gain mo selling options with some months where you might have a  drawdown. The best and stable traders I know make about year return on their portfolio. Many exmarket makers have told me if you can make mo consistently you are doing excellent.My advice Read the books. Read more complex books. Put a little of that money at risk when you feel confident. I dont like paper trading as you react far different when you have real money on the line. Find an edge. Then hopefully find another.,StockMarket,cg5427m,1,t5_2qjuv

Hes written several macro pieces lately which seem like theyre trying to figure out just what  is going to be like but at the end of the day we simply wont know until Dec. .Whats more significant to me and should be to all investors is how PE levels are trending and which companies have more or less value to provide to investors. This is how Ritholtz invests too.Finally Ill point out that macro funds are getting clobbered in it isnt easy to predict the big markets movements like in previous years which is pretty much what the Fed wanted to happen.

It doesnt indicate when the open put interest will close impossible to predict but you can use one of a million ways to determine that it is spiking because oversold in a short term just like youd do any stock. Climbing OVX and a stall in the fall of oil prices as the end of a few nasty days reversal inc. Years of trading it I can just spot an exhaustion spike pretty accurately Im sure you can easily see it too. If you look at  however you can see the exception. OVX Going up to the high s and that OVX pattern sort of just traded a little bit higher and higher each day with corrections along the way and no real spikes.

6793358,0,t1_d0kqdf9,Made a research and i found out that this was actually a bilateral agreement with both Saudi Arabia and Russia agreeing to freeze their output. However two facts about the agreement didnt seem to come out. First the agreement in the two governments eyes seems to be contingent on other producing members agreeing to also hold output at January levels. Second and more subtly freezing output at January levels means freezing output at up upper end of both the Saudi and Russian infrastructure capacity to move that much production. By way of comparison Saudi output ramped up from roughly . mmbblday at the start of  to . mmbblday after briefly flirting with a record breaking . mmbblday in October while Russian output ramped up from . mmbblday to . mmbblday over the same period.Roughly speaking these output freezes first dont really alleviate any of the existing oversupply pressure in the global liquids markets and second dont really represent a significant commitment from the two parties. Aside from the earlier expectation of others joining in more on that later the infrastructure investment needed to surpass the January levels are significant. To put into perspective what these numbers mean for Saudi Arabia imagine that . mmbblday represents  Very Large Crude Carriers VLCCs leaving their ports every single day seven days a week. Mooring preparing loading and unmooring a VLCC is something that requires between  and  days at a minimum if we assume perfect operations with no snafus  something that never materializes. To keep this volume moving one would need at least  deep water mooring points operating x... and at the slightest mishap one would need an th and a th as a backup. While easier to contextualize because Saudi Arabia moves their export products by ship Russia is in largely the same kind of situation given the length and age of their pipelines and the harsh environment of western Siberia.Fundamentally the agreement to freeze production is a unlikely to alleviate the current global oversupply situation in crude markets and b is not much of an agreement to curtail activities given that the transport infrastructure of both countries is largest operating almost at capacity today. Basically to add the next  mmbblday on top of their current combined export volume of  mmbblday would really require some massive infrastructure investments of pushing their delivery capacity to  something anyone in the oil business knows is an inevitable recipe for an accident  hence is never attempted.,StockMarket,d0mbeou,1,t5_2qjuv

8156325,0,t1_d4wkg5x,The bottom was Monday. Tuesday should have been a bounce minimum and likely a fall on Wednesday because it was at the  day ma line. However the rally was really strong on Tuesday and the algorithm bought up the momentum. On Wednesday we learned that US interest rate have very low chance of rising this year due to Brexit and the UK central bank monetary intervention propped up the market. This really set the bottom for the market and likely prevented further market fear and increased volatility. On Thursday people who missed the rally bought in. Friday before the long July th weekend usually was an up day. Since it went up a lot previous three days it was expected to be a sideways or slight lower close day. Instead it was an up day. In all the drop was fast and the recovery was fast as well and there was barely any resistance on the way up. Usually the technical indicators once it is damaged like from the   day drop need some time to short itself out. In summary the prediction that the market will recover in the near term played out as expected. However I did not expect the market to recover from this so fast. I expected a week of increased volatility of falls bounces and recovery before bottoming the middle of the week and then rising near the end of the week. Then market will slowly rise over the next  weeks. Instead everything recovered in one week. ,StockMarket,d4x37ah,1,t5_2qjuv

9443934,0,t3_5a27o4,Hows this for a ridiculous statAccording to Stock Traders Almanac Since the Wednesday after Brexit the SampP  SPX has closed within  of its ATH every single day. That comes out to about  months or  consecutive trading days! Evidently we havent seen anything like that since the first half of ! At the same time the thing that makes this streak strange is that in   of those  days made new ATHs versus just  new highs during this recent streak.Heres another way to look at things The SampP  has now gone  straight days without a new high yet every single day it has closed within  of the highs. This is the longest such streak since  topping the previous record of  straight days in late . Yowza!In other words  NOTHING has happened for the indices essentially since July lol.Historically October has been the most volatile month but that has not held true at all in . With just  trading day left to go in October only one day this entire month has closed up or down . You have to go back at least  years to find the last time October was that tame. Coming into this month who thought that would happen? Seriously.But wait! Theres more lol ...Did you also know that the DJIA is doing something extremely rare. For  consecutive trading days now it has closed above its daily sma but under its daily sma. You have to go back at least  years for the last time we saw something like this.Heres what makes this recent action strange though The DJIA is currently about . away from ATHs. Back in  the last time this happened it was more than  away from an ATH.And this is only the th time since  the DJIA has ever closed  straight days between its  and smas.Taking a closer look at the  times the DJIA went  trading days or more between the  and sma the current streak is the closest to the ATH with many of the other instances taking place in bear markets. In other words  its tough to compare now versus then as the market is behaving much more differently.I think we can all agree that this lack of volatility will eventually come to an end at some point and we would expect some much higher volatility before the year is out. Of course the presidential election is the big wildcard and should there be any unexpected outcomes for either Hillary or Trump a spike in volatility is more likely.,StockMarket,d9d33ii,24,t5_2qjuv

10239749,0,t1_dc4forn,Totally.  Youre welcome.  Im  and lets just say a true graduate never stops learning.  If it helps to give you a scope of where Im at and what Im thinking...Im a teacher.  I have state retirement Roth IRA and a ROTH k all while dabbling a bit in an etrade account and robin hood.  Im trying to set up several streams of income so when Im on a fixed rate income in retirement with no mortgage payment Im sitting pretty.  Maybe ss will be there who knows.  It is a  year sacrifice.  Another example is Im doing Amazon FBA with my fianc.  We both have nd jobs as servers.  You see the trend.   I have  shares of AMD Robin Hood and  shares at a  ratio of FNMA and FMCC respectively.  I also have speculative and now seemingly stupid holdings of MSTX and GEVO nothing crazy.  Like you say losses are commonhappen.  AMD FNMA and FMCC I have great confidence in holding long term.  FNMA and FMCC might very well pay off my debts and then some.  They may not.FNMA if it hits     long term Ive thought through exit plans more like tranches.  Ill sell off in different blocks and eventually hold maybe  shares forever because who knows where it could land as far as pps. Those are the stocks Id be reinvesting profits andor deciding whether or not to pay off debt.I think what people are trying to caution you from doing is going out and buying a nice watch football tickets nds rds and ths of things you dont need now.  Most will tell you before investing to invest in yourself first aka pay off debts with the logic that you may not make investment returns that outpace the interest on your student loans.For me it has been a delicate balance and decision of not wanting to wait any longer so Im putting away something vs. nothing all while tackling debt.  Im lucky enough to be getting married and well end up being in an advantageous spot to knock out debt.  The more youre able to survive off your current check and save for things all while continuing to max out your retirement accounts and maximize investments the better off you should be.  A pair of jeans or an impulse buy of a gopro will wane as far as importance compared to buying your grandkids a birthday present or trying to pay medical bills later.Try to get excited about living simpler.  Better to eat a nothing sandwich now and seafood and steak later than to do so now and have nothing but ramen when youre in your final years.I hope this helps.I know Ive said a lot.  Where are you as far as your scope of financial and life balance?  Sorry people are being harsh but they are delivering accurate advice so do try and take it with a thick skin.  Always best to play the idiot than act an expert while remaining a fool.  ,StockMarket,dc4qe1i,2,t5_2qjuv

10476220,0,t3_5q0ik5,A Google search will turn up many possibilities but I keep coming back to designing my own allin spreadsheet that exactly fits my needs and wants. Google Sheets has a GoogleFinance function that retrieves live data. The spreadsheet runs on the computer tablet and smartphone.If you are looking for an Android app to track your holdings and the market this  continues to be my absolute favorite onthego readableataglance live data. Bullet proof over years from a responsive developer. I really like the simple screen in large type and there is news and graphs. Dont mean to make sound like a commercial but I just like the design.Im not sure if there is an iOS version but if you are on Facebook look at  to get more info. I am not on FB.HTH.

10715592,0,t3_5t6wd0,We all take a degree of risk buying a share some stocks are high risk and this is one of those. If you look at the trade volumes on a volatile day for this stock you will see the number of trades exceeds the total available stock. So the stock is bought and sold without looking at anything other than speculation on the minute by minute price of the stock and predicting what it is going to do in the next minute.My advice is stay away unless you have money you can afford to lose.,StockMarket,ddl8fek,1,t5_2qjuv

10944787,0,t1_de730tw,Absolutely! Tax cuts lead to higher corporate profit which in turn promotes higher wages and company expansion. My only thought is what if businesses dont pass on these profits and simply boost their stock value?

Hype stock is risky as shit as youre basically betting on stupider greedier people than you buying in after you so you can flip it quickly or youre simply stupid and greedy and investing in it out of personal feeling.Look at PE earnings look at potential markets and competitors and make sure the company wont disappear overnight.Also invest in what you know. If you play video games investing in the video game market might be a good idea. Just remember to be level headed and honest.I tend to know tech and manufacturing products as that is what i know but i also know that i know nothing so a good chunk of my portfolio is index funds.
