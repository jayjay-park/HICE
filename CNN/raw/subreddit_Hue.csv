The short clip I linked to only shows the score alert without the play by play action. Ive modified it a bit since I shot that last year.

6422192,0,t3_43nu6g,The Hue Lux has been discontinued and replaced with Hue White which is the same K white light but is brighter at lmThe Hue bridge is the same no matter which starter kit you got it with so you can easily connect any of the newer lights to it. There is however a new bridge which is square and supports Apples HomeKit. If you have an iPhone and you want to use Siri to control your lights this could be handy.If you want coloured lights it is cheaper if you also need a bridge to buy the set but the Hue Whites are very cheap now about  EUR so if you dont plan on using the colour then its a waste of money. You can get a Hue White starter with the new bridge as well  bulbs same as the old Lux kit but it seems to be a bit expensive.You can connect old bulbs to a new bridge but it will be difficult if you dont unpair them with the existing bridge first.,Hue,czjlah3,2,t5_2vao5

Scenes cant simply turn down whatever settings are already active as a scene must contain both brightness and colour data.

Ive been using the new app but the Geofence often fails to work amp its time for me to switch back to the first gen app until they fix it at least for the Geofence.gt Their upgrade alert when I read between the lines led me to believe that they knew they werent ready for a complete replacement. Else why wouldnt they just upgrade the existing app?My guess is that they knew theyd get a lot of backlash from people who like the old app.  I really wish theyd add the option to individually select color brightness and saturation of each individual light using a color selector rather than a picture in the old app.  You can by using a picture of a color wheel but thats clunky.gt My guess is that there are patent or rights issues at play which made them rebuild from ground up and meet a litigation deadline.Interesting guess!

Then you simply set up rules that say at sunset  ltdo whatevergt and at sunrise  ltdo whatevergt.The advantage to this is that they will run without any internet access and without the potential delays that IFTTT can have.

11378682,0,t1_dfloczg,Since you are on Android you should get Tasker or potentially Llama.  Tasker allows you to take control of most of the features on Android by creating Profiles Triggers and Tasks.  With Tasker youll be able to create much more complicated lighting triggers including but not limited to location and time based ones.  One of the super great things about Tasker is you can chain Triggers and Tasks together in order to do more complicated things.For a location based hue task I would first use a Near Cell Tower trigger to turn on a GPS trigger which will toggle the lights.  You can use the GPS trigger directly but it will use more battery.  Just remember location stuff will trigger whenever the criteria are hit so things like airplane mode and power cycling may lead to unintended light toggling.,Hue,dflr68v,3,t5_2vao5
