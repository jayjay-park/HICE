479275,1,t1_cfuq096,I will do the evaluation by myself judging the progression of behaviour in recorded visualaudio. And I can always get second and third judgement from rd party. Its not that hard for me to get credible people in behavioural analysis and psychological development to do the evaluation.so this answers the st question.For nd question whether its fixable or not is not relevant for me. Responsibility comes from the degree of maturity of mind. Thats why our revenge is adjustable depending on several factors that I have yet to share here. If she and her relatives can fix her good. If not its not my business. The only thing that important is repercussion. No one can get free from any mistake that heshe make before getting herhis punishment.rd question punishing someone permanently is the best stance on particular cases. She is going to be given the choice to redeem her wrongdoing so she gets significantly reduced punishment or the choice to ignore the offer and she gets scar for her life. If she breaks its not my business. Just throw her at bushes I dont care. Just like she didnt consider what would happen to my son when she started bullying him.and for your th paragraph and st statement I have neutral stance in life. I dont care whether someones going to be a better person or not. You can do whatever you want as long as you dont deliberately wrong other people. sometimes you accidentally step on other foot. Its trivial matter you ask for forgiveness and I forgive you and we call it a day. But when you deliberately do evil you cant just ask for forgiveness and call it a day. you still need to taste the repercussion in order to truly learn the lesson not to wrong other people. You made the decision in the first place why you dont want the reaction of your action?And as a neutral person I also dont believe in the punishment driven societies. We need the balance of it. Good people will do good even though there are no incentive and bad people will do bad things even though there are punishments. But the moderate people will need influence in order to do good. To those who are putting emotional comfort can be pushed to do good with good incentives and to those who value fear more can be kept staying within good behaviour with fearful punishments.To your nd and last statement yes I lack of empathy. My philosophical stance that I shaped doesnt include empathy for passing judgement. Perhaps I lack empathy as much as the criminals but I dont start doing evil in the first place. I just answer their evilness with the evilness they deserve.after all how could we protect all the good things from the evil without employing evil itself? tolerating the intolerant is not working for functioning society and so we need to be intolerant to the intolerant. And letting the kids free from any mistake without any repercussion is not working in my model of world.no hard feeling bro. I hope you wont take me as aggressive either. But I really like this kind of discussion. cheers!,myevilplan,cfuqvzw,-1,t5_2uqvh

5375819,0,t3_3oascf,Bugging someones office is a felony at least in the US.  Dont judge a person based upon their family but their own actions.  I lead a quite normal life while my brother has committed  felonies and is in and out of Rehab.  What you are dealing with is office politics.  This person obviously has power over you.  What happens to you and your family when you lose your job and she keeps yours because of your failed evil plan?You need to protect yourself  dont commit any felonies.  Try to be as compliant as possible and ride it out.  Keep a paper trail.  Any email or memo that she sends out that is against policy or essentially being a dick save it.  In my experience you will never win an adversarial argument against a superior in HR without a good paper trail or evidence of misconduct.  ,myevilplan,cvytlfg,0,t5_2uqvh

My teacher last year always kept his room unlocked like a fucking jackass and I knew it was unlocked during rd period I also knew there was an IB class that used computers for film. So I played the porn and froze the screens on an double penetration scene took out the usb and casually walked out.EDIT btw there was talk all around my high school for  weeks and I got out scott free,myevilplan,cxye0qg,1,t5_2uqvh
