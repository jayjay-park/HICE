Glad theres no rolling in part  even if it is just replaced with a back dash instead. Just looks a little more sensible than someone rolling all over the place.,thewitcher,cjuub3n,1,t5_2tqm2
2686762,0,t3_2djwmk,Yeah I tried playing this game on my PC but what can I say... it sorely needs an update.I did get to play the Tutorial though... and it sort of turned me off from the game.  Its like they throw every skill youll need throughout the game at you in about five minutes and it was extremely overwhelming.I was without an Xbox  for about a year and a half but the other month I finally acquired another... so I thought Why the heck not?  Ill buy The Witcher  and finally give it another go.Im glad I did.  The rest of the game is nothing like that hellish tutorial lol.  Everything actually seems to make sense as far as crafting weapon and armor management etc.  The core game isnt nearly as intimidating as that tutorial.  At first theres a bit of a learning curve but not much.  You get the hang of it pretty quick.  And the story... its really quite amazing just how much is at play here.  Theres a lot of characters a lot of choices and a lot of it actually affects your game.  As a Witcher you get to choose if you want to do the right thing the selfish thing the right thing the wrong thing... or just not do it at all.  Quite wonderful.But the game does have its flaws.  I feel like the further we got into the game the less open it was.  I feel the first chapter had the best setting to snoop around in what with the town and the forest.  The story wasnt really that interesting yet but it didnt really matter... I got to deal with a troll search an underground dungeon in fire damaged ruins to hunt a creepy ghost and so much more.  The second chapter however closed me off in a mountainous city... which was confusing to navigate for some time.  On the map you really only get to see a very specific lay of the land... so map markers are nearly pointless at times.  They can be just as confusing as helpful.  Also the rocky setting got to me after a while... I wanted something a bit more.  True you can escape and view another forestlike area on each end but I feel like I spent WAY more time in that city than actually questing while out and about.  Things really picked up though story wise which was definitely the saving grace of it all.Chapter ... Im still playing it but I get the feeling that its going to be really really short... and just looking at the lay of the land available to me it looksfeels like this part of the game was rushed.  Still an overall great game... definitely amongst the best I actually got around to playing in .  This really leaves me excited for the next installment.  Witcher  here I come!,thewitcher,cn9a2q4,1,t5_2tqm2
