982626,0,t3_25d087,Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. It uses Galaxies as throwing stars.Knight of Gold Five Star Stories. Personal Mortar Headd of Emperor Amaterasu. All the MHs meet your criteria The KoG and his attendant Mirage Knights are just some of the baddest MFs in the Joker System.Almost all of the Gundam MSs fit your requirements the biggest and baddest of which are the Mobile Armors like the Dendrobium and the Shamblo. Also very nasty are the custom MSs built for Newtypes like the Sazabi Nu Gundam and the like.Actually almost all Anime mecha fall within your guidelines. But those are three of my fav types.,Mecha,chfzdu6,3,t5_2s86h

2144478,0,t1_clbl4hn,To be fair. Even without Harmony Gold in the way. Theres an issue with  and Frontier. Theyre LOADED with music compared to say Zero SDF II DYRL or Plus. The music is the issue with those  as its a separate licensing fee. Not saying it couldnt be done but it would be really expensive for something that might not sell.,Mecha,clcetnp,2,t5_2s86h
2818559,0,t1_cnoewds,gt Basically it tried really hard to have some serious themes while resorting to wacky slapstickThis isnt something that is unique to Cross Ange nor to objectively bad anime.  Consider the fact that the critically acclaimed Evangelion also had its slapstick moments  the toothpick scene Asuka and Tojis interaction on the carrier how  and  were soundly defeated by the twin Angels initially.  I dont think those cheapened the seriousness of the show overall.The lighthearted moments incidentally served as a way to describe life within Arzenal as well as Ange and Tusks general inability to function as normal human beings due to their personal complexes.  Said moments helped drive Anges acceptance of herself and others being Norma.gt The story feels all over the place with plot points coming up left and right but Im honestly not confident that they will all get wrapped up satisfactorilyI agree.  Cross Ange to me fails a little at its pacing.  It didnt introduce plot points at a consistent pace and instead is basically throwing a lot of things in all at once.  Its hectic and exciting yes but it does mean that several things that could have been expanded on such as Julios and possibly Sylvias deaths are glossed over very quickly.That said were more or less at the halfway point of the series.  Its still possible for the important threads to be wrapped up and the odd little bits akin to SEEDs space whales be kept in reserve for a potential sequel later.  Of course this being a Fukudahelmed project its anybodys guess if he will follow up on those aforementioned little bits or if he will just focus on the continuing adventures of his preferred characters.gt How many times has the same crotch gag been played now?Six I think?gt Additionally the fights feel freakin boring. They have planes but so many shots focus on them shifting to humanoid mode so that they can stand still and not really do anything.I think this is a weakness of Fukudas directing. Its something that I think you see a lot of in his other work especially Gundam SEED.  When he wants to make it impressive he can and he will do so.  But when he feels its unnecessary he will basically just phone it in for those battles.  Be thankful that at least its not repeated stock footage the bane of SEED watchers.gt I know its possible to have humor in serious shows and to have deep moments in comedy but you sure as hell wont find that in this show.I dispute that.The two driving themes for the first half of Cross Ange is discrimination between Mana users and Norma between Ange and Hildas harem and so on and what happens when idealization goes wrong.  Salia suffers a lot from the latter where her idealization of the commander and herself drives her to make a lot of pretty nasty mistakes that nearly cost the lives of her entire team several times.  Watching her realize just how from that ideal she is that moment when she finally accepted she and the commander could never be Vilkiss true chosen pilot that was a really good wham moment.I would like to describe Hildas character development as a deep moment too because she is a good example of a character that suffers from both themes but I dont think an entire arc counts as a moment.gt Even the fanservice is nothing special.Well the ParaMails are really beautiful machines so I would say the mecha fanservice is good.gt I really feel like the writing has been average at bestI agree. Cross Ange is not really that special but it does has its moments.,Mecha,cnogotu,2,t5_2s86h

9362013,0,t1_d928m65,While its not strictly a mecha show we do have tokusatsu and daikaiju listed in our sidebar so I want to put in a word for UltraSeven.  If youre looking for something in the vein of Star Trek or The Twilight Zone in terms of using metaphors to tackle social and political issues then thats as good as youre going to get. While it was made way back in  a lot of UltraSeven episodes are remarkably prescient.  Among others one episode opens with a man walking into the middle of the street with a rifle and randomly opening fire on everyone around him.  Dont worry in the end its all about brainwashing by evil aliens who want to undermine mankinds trust in each other and the narrator helpfully reassures the audience that this could never happen in todays world because in todays world there is no trust between men to undermine.spoilerSeven also struggles with alien plots that include child armies propaganda campaigns plane hijackings and a host of other issues that will sound remarkably familiar to anyone watching it today if you strip away the science fiction veneer on top.  He also tries harder than the average toku hero to find peaceful solutions to his problems and as a result when things do come to violence and they often do its an action show after all its often treated as a tragic outcome instead of a triumphant one. Before I make it sound too bleak though its still a show about a bright red superhero defending the Earth and not every episode is some deep social metaphor.  A lot of them are old fashioned science fiction stories and giant monster punch em ups.  If you enjoy the toku genre or even if you just love shows like Star Trek and The Twilight Zone then UltraSeven is a mustsee show. ,Mecha,d92pazv,3,t5_2s86h
