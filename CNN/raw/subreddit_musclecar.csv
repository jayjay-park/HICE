3348716,0,t1_cp9og9m,It is but Ive been somewhat curious about the relatively low torque number. Im most interested in seeing what performance shops can do to bring it up.  Unless they can do something about it Im more interested in blown vs at the moment dropping big numbers. ,musclecar,cp9z98z,1,t5_2rntd
3509678,0,t1_cpru8ow,As an AMC owner you are right about parts being hard to find.  But body specific parts.  Engine parts are easy to find because of the popularity of the jeep and its models. ,musclecar,cpsbt5n,1,t5_2rntd

6442520,0,t1_czlou51,any resto is not cheap but mopars raise the bar on price    I got lucky last year and found my inner panels on sale for  ....  off Christmas sale. otherwise   for the set!! that is just nuts but what are you gonna do? save up the dough and make big purchases the overseas shipping is a killer. also check out   talk to Dave he is absolutely STELLAR and will take good care of you. classic and yearone have parts for many old makes but Roseville specializes in Mopars and they really know their stuff. another thought on parts ordering using the forums above find another Mopar lover in the UK and do combined orders to save costs long term,musclecar,czlp2bt,2,t5_2rntd

10162360,0,t1_dbfkdrl,In their defense sort of the Challenger is based on architecture developed in the s. The Camaro and Mustang are vastly newer designs. So its no surprise that the Challenger fails miserably. Theyve been able to turn an ancient platform into some relatively cool cars but its age shows in stuff like crash testing.Regardless Im sure even the Challenger would put my s BMW to shame in this regard.,musclecar,dbvykfd,1,t5_2rntd
