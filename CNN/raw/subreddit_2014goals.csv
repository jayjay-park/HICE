109378,0,t1_ceoco8k,I just had time to read this advice and Id have to say thank you so much!!! Ive been reviewing myself lately to prepare for interviews and I find that doing this is a really good opportunity to learn more and understand myself better. I was able to pick up good points about myself weak points that I want to improve and the things that separate me from other applicants really well. Being an Asian my thoughts are not  in english lets say... ? and it can be difficult to answer questions spontaneously because I need time to organize my thoughts but I can imagine these things will grow over time. Once I get my first interview I hope it goes well but acts more as a practice round to prepare me for the important ones. ,2014goals,ceqvveu,2,t5_2zf8u
