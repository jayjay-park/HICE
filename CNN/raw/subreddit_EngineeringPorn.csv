2483974,0,t3_2nwt2e,The development of fiber optic cables is incredible.  I only know the very very basics from this fantastic book really amazing for so many reasons which I cant recommend enough.  It shows the pioneering of a ton of the most important current technologies tubes telephones microwaves satellites cell phones fiber optics cavitrons and a bunch more and the revolutionary environments and cultures that fostered that growth.  Corning of course made the fiber.  Cables in general were amazing.  We think of plastic as so cheap as to practically cost nothing but back then IIRC cant find my book D the insulation was one of the most expensive parts as it was made from natural latex from the guttapercha tree god I wish I could find the book.  As you can imagine it took a ton of work to make a machine to produce cables that were kilometers long.  The first real transatlantic cable was laid in  and working up to that required a huge amount of research and iteration.  It was fundamentally made possible by polyethylene.  The first test cables just randomly started turning into swiss cheese turns out shipworms dont give a damn about what they eat.  Steel jackets.  Then the cables just started snapping.  Its pretty damn hard to figure out why an underwater cable three miles long is snapping when you dont have cameras underwater radio or scuba... turns out that sharks sense and apparently have an innate hatred of electricity jk and attacked the cables.  Copper shield steel cable reinforcement thicker cables.  Works pretty good.  Minimizing crosstalk and such took some effort.  Then microwaves start replacing cables on land cant do microwaves underwater.  Everybody wants to upgrade the TAT but its actually pretty fucking tricky making a cable out of a bit of glass  kilometers long and a fraction of a millimeter wide.,EngineeringPorn,cmisktm,1,t5_2smf3

Cost is a function of land cost per square foot and initial capital outlay but also ends up having a time component once you factor in amortization of the capital outlay and maintenance into the costs so the final number becomes cost per vehicleyear stored.A vertical structure increases vehicles per square foot decreases land costs but increases capital outlay and maintenance. The determining factor ends up being whether the money saved by the decreased land costs overcome the increased capital outlay and maintenance. For this reason structures such as these are typically seen in dense expensive cities. ,EngineeringPorn,cqik26x,9,t5_2smf3

4787924,0,t1_cty1my0,Well the reason I forgot about the magnetic acceleration is because the hyperloop train has a huge turbofan at the front sucking in the remaining low density air and expelling it out via the air cushions. I had for some reason thought that they would be accelerated via pushing the remaining air out the back behind and essentially riding a pressure wave. But thinking about it again now I am pretty sure that there isnt enough air to do that efficiently and therefore periodic magnetic accelerators stationed every couple of km would keep the traincars at speed and they float along on air cushions without friction and very little drag in the evacuated tubes much like a air hockey puck. Agreed that it is an amazing idea and there are several routes where I could see this being potentially economically viable. Just needs some much needed capital injection to get the kinks worked out first.,EngineeringPorn,cty223o,1,t5_2smf3

If you buy everyone these bucketstanks with funnelsso they arent useful for other things you have to pay them enough to  make it worth to carry the buckets around and  not use the buckets for another more useful purpose instead.  Hopefully that wage will be useful enough to incentivize all that.I think this is supposed to be a dropin solution for places that have sewage and electricity but have outgrown more lowtech methods of sewage disposal dump it into the drinking water a la Chicago until  and the paying people for poop is more of a theoretical thingfor people without sewage they can have that option.Put like that it makes a lot more sense.  AFAIK most wastewater plants are prone to contaminating the outside and basically just mean settling out and filtering water producing high density waste that needs to be disposed.

Hell they could make the wheel whip out of your hands and steer itself if they wanted to. The feedback has nothing to do with mechanical vs electric. Both systems use a mechanically connected steering system with non mechanical assist. And that assist can be tuned to feel like literally anything. And actually the electric is much easier to dial in but maybe the cars youre talking about were poorly designedexecuted.

10556671,0,t1_dd4cixg,If water flowed instantly fast that would be true but at some point you might eventually see a gradient occur where the water level is higher in the bridge than the rest of the canal.Ex One ship is very far away from the canal it is already displacing water.  When it enters the canal nothing changes as the water level remains constantEx Four ships are in the waterway very far away from the canal.  Two of them are travelling seaward and two of them are travelling shoreward.  They all enter the canal at the same time.  The displaced water from two ships travels forward but is then reflected by the other two ships and a cycle occurs.  Thus their is more mass in the canal at this time and less in the rest of the waterway the water level in the canal will be higher than it was at time  and the water level in the rest of the water way will be lower than it was at time .||this would never happen and even if it did I doubt it would cause failure but this was a fun thought exercise for me,EngineeringPorn,dd4puu5,14,t5_2smf3

11047381,0,t3_5xqalf,Obligatory ground speed check storygtThere were a lot of things we couldnt do in an SR but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment.gtgtIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed  hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts  feet below us I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet.gtgtI was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however. Walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.gtgtJust to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.gtgtWe listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied November Charlie  Im showing you at ninety knots on the ground.gtgtNow the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the  Houston Center voice. I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like Chuck Yeager or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.gtgtJust moments after the Cessnas inquiry a Twin Beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed. I have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed. Boy I thought the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue a navy F pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center Dusty  ground speed check. Before Center could reply Im thinking to myself hey Dusty  has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it ol Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. Hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion Dusty  Center we have you at  on the ground.gtgtAnd I thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still I thought it must be done  in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.gtgtSomewhere  miles above Arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally and with no emotion Walter spoke Los Angeles Center Aspen  can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation and the replay came as if was an everyday request. Aspen  I show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground.gtgtI think it was the fortytwo knots that I liked the best so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice Ah Center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.gtgtFor a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A.came back with Roger that Aspen Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.gtgtIt all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed and more importantly Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine days work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.gtgtFor just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.,EngineeringPorn,dek79n4,184,t5_2smf3
