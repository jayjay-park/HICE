2852035,0,t1_cns9qiw,Yeah I when I hopped in I was absolutely blown away by the size and scope as well as the level of detail put into each area...For example I went up to The Wall and yes its as impressive as youd think and was flying along it just scoping the view. Got quite a ways away from Castle Black when I noticed destroyed fragments of an old staircase partway down the wall...that attention to detail just dropped my jar and its everywhere. Cant wait until all the building is done and its time to dive full force into the RP.,WesterosCraft,cns9ywk,4,t5_2ttjq
