802265,0,t3_23bqtz,Yes it could. Most of the university courses Ive seen dont require any prior knowledge of Japanese. Some require you to know hiragana and katakana which you can learn in a couple of weeks easily. You need to look at university websites and see what the entry requirements are because all of them will be different,moronarmy,cgvgyt5,1,t5_30ybm

1708230,0,t3_2dw4yt,If you have a few hundred bucks to drop on Rosetta Stone consider for about the same price you can get the entire  lessons of Pimsleur Japanese as an MP download. I highly recommend Pimsleur as it does a great job explaining things while also starting you out actually speaking out loud which is by far one of the more useful aspects to learn. Ive personally used both and pretty much gave up on Rosetta Stone as I found it frustrating and I realized I wasnt actually remembering very much from it in the long run.Genki is also very great and certainly the best for what it does but you wont really speak out loud much with that so unless you supplement that with a website where you speak with native Japanese speakers as you go you may find it difficult later on to pronounce things out loud.Its also incredibly useful to supplement all learning with Anki or some other spaced repetition software to ensure that you occasionally review old material and dont forget anything.,moronarmy,cjuhfs5,1,t5_30ybm
1905385,0,t3_2gfyzb,depends on the city a large city like Tokyo Osaka even Fukuoka will have lots of options. Small towns in the middle of nowhere and you are out of luck. Might be easier to help you if you tell us the city you are going to. ,moronarmy,ckisc90,3,t5_30ybm
6906845,0,t3_4abrt3,Ive read studies that suggest the opposite is true due to the way dyslexia functions some people suggest that Japanese Chinese and other characters based languages dont follow the same rules as English.,moronarmy,d0z7kuq,1,t5_30ybm
