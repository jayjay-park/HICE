4905097,0,t1_cucs28l,Use Reinand instead of Pasta can do all the Pasta does but on an Emunand so Reinand gt Pasta.First use your Cubic Ninja to launch the Gateway Menu this doesnt need the flashcard at all and backup your System Nand.   Turn off the NDS get your mSD out and store a copy of the NAND.BIN in your HDD and in your external HDD and in your USB stick and in a DVD. Just make sure it is stored safely for posterior use.  Now get back inside the Gateway menu and use the Format Emunand option. This will take GB away from your mSD so either get a bigger SD already or get rekt.  Now take out your mSD and format your NDS without it. Yup do it youll be just unlinking your NANDs before anything nasty happens.  While your NDS is resetting itself set your mSD for the use of Ninjhax . the .x wont work. Also get FBI .dsx and .cia on it as well as Reinands launcher and CFW stuff can be found for download on Reis Pastebin   Now once everythings finished and in place put your mSD back in the NDS and erase the save on Cubic Ninja forgot how sorry get it to launch Ninjhax .. Once youre inside the Homebrew Channel go ahead and boot Reinand.  Now youre inside the Emunand! BUT shit isnt done yet go straight to the Homebrew Channel from here and start FBI use it to install the FBI.cia to your Emunand.  Reset the NDS from the HC and youll be back on the Sysnand.  Now just get back to the Emunand via CN and youre done! Congrats on following directions to setup an Emunand on a NDS! Now go!

Yes theres no need to have NAND.bin on your SD card unless youre restoring from it either emuNAND or sysNAND. If you wont have an NNID previously linked its not too important which you format. But if you followed the guide then youll have FBI on emuNAND which formatting would lose.

The other option is to backup your emunand copy your card to your computer along with the emunand backup put your old card back in use Emunand to get to Complete Emunand Setup.

6902889,0,t3_4aa3mc,Hi! I currently have a Fire Emblem Fates Edition NDS XL. I was really lucky. I have a few questions about the downgrade process. I checked the Sha sum of ..UFullnDS and I got the correct checksum on the Github website eadddcfceaeaaabeabc but I did not get the correct MDSHA This is mine EAEBDEFC. I am a little scared about the downloaded ..UFullnDS firmware. Did I download the correct one? I havent even opened up my NDS XL yet do I immediately loadup my fixedup SD card and downgrade the moment I open up the NDS XL? Or do I need to use the stock SD card first setup internet and then load in my G FAT SD Card? I heard that you can easily mess up if you let the DS update... I saw on a previous post that the Fire Emblem edition of the NDS XL has some problems with frankenfirmwaring. What causes this and did the yellow browserhax update fix this problem? I dont have any games yet. If I need a game to fix frankenfirmware would any work? What is a payload and flashing from A to B?Thanks!,3dshacks,d0yrf0x,1,t5_2sbkg

6911312,0,t1_d0xuwhi,Given the way this is intended to be used thats not technically correct. Its a very minute difference that this actually makes if you use it correctly but its still a difference. Youre supposed to use this on an ALH build that doesnt have screeninit so that the boot manager actually initializes the screen itself only when necessary. This saves a slight amount of times since the ALH doesnt need to initialize the screen before the boot manager payload is loaded but it really only saves time for payloads that dont need screeninit.,3dshacks,d0zpuro,3,t5_2sbkg

6914223,0,t3_4aa3mc,I wanted to make a thread but I feel like it would be frowned upon.I was wondering how many other consoles that had a FULL CFW were able to just update and use all online functions with no loss of normal function on a regular basis like the DS does with for example sysNAND and ALH?It seems like our level of access is so high at this point obviously theres always more to do that we are basically set up until the DS lifespan is up. What could Nintendo do at this point? I mean I can install any game from the eshop or retail release and DLC without any fear of being banned from online or my system even being picked up as hacked by Nintendo. I can even visit the eshop and update the games like normal.I can update through the official update servers without fear of my exploit ALH ever being patched. So as long as the CFW I use supports the latest NATIVEFIRM update they push out my DS is good to go.And on top of all of that if I happen to mess with my sysNAND too much and accidentally brick it I have a permanent solution to flash a backup and go right back to how it was.,3dshacks,d101sdl,2,t5_2sbkg

Today I cloned my SD card to a bigger one GB to GB and now my games crashes a lot of times.I cloned them using the dd command in Linux then I expanded the partition from  gb to  using all the SD card. Everything works flawlessly It boots into the emunand I can launch all the games everything is good. Except that for some reason MH keeps crashing.I havent tested other titles yet but right now Its the only one that I play so it doesnt really matter to me. It crashes sometimes when Im playing the actual game I can get past the menus move arround the towns even grab a mission and complete it but it crashes every time I finish a mission or I see a big monster. Ill check other games to see if they crash too.Old card gt Micro SDHC Sandisk Ultra  GBNew card gt Micro SDHC Transcend  GBAny idea about what could be causing this or how could I fix it?,3dshacks,d1p7hfe,1,t5_2sbkg

For both custom themes are much easier to use if you use Howling Theme Tool edit save files edit play coin list can be achieved through homebrew as well change the region of a DS play out of region titles and dump your cartridge games if you want them installed onto your SD card so you dont have to worry about losing it.,3dshacks,d1pw9d0,1,t5_2sbkg

Pros as I experienced   faster boot time  sec      adds a safety layer to your device if you brick it somehow you can recover  Patched sysnand means no emunand means more space on the SDCard  These are the major Pros.

CFW is free or thereabouts and seems to be the best choice. You wont be able to play DS games without a DS flashcart but those are so cheap now that its basically a trivial purchase I think mine was ?. GBA games also come along with CFW and if you choose the AuReiNand path are extra easy to get going as you no longer have to manually patch AGBFIRMtldr buy OoT and Powersaves and install CFW  buy a flashcart for DS games total cost will be less than a skyds You wont brick as long as you can follow instructions. ,3dshacks,d20lpgg,2,t5_2sbkg

7330088,0,t1_d2apn51,gt If the bootrom isnt console specific does that mean it will probably work on all DS of a specific hardware iteration? Such as all ODS NDS DS etc since its bootROM and is supposedly read only. That would suggest to me that its never updated outside of hardware revisions so vulnerabilities if they exist are not really fixable without having hardware access. That is assuming of course there are any usable vulnerabilities in the bootrom which I assume is quite small which makes them not particularly likely.Yep if theres a vulnerability there only a new generation of hardware could fix it. Do remember that the unprotected half of the bootrom looks very much like it was written by hand. Humans are notably terrible at assembly usually.gt Most of the encryption stuff aside does this mean we could unbrick even if we broke ALH since we can exploit the bootrom before it would throw the BSoD or would SD initialization not be possible or if thats unknown?Thats currently unknown and would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.gt Could we also make NAND dumps generic and load them onto other DS or is that dependant on something else? Would it give us insight into how the OTP is related to console specific information?NAND dumps could not be made generic most likely since they use consoleunique keys those however are very likely derived from the OTP so once the algorithm is known its a possibility. Having bootroms would explain a lot about the OTP especially how its decrypted if you look at an OTP dump  you wont find your CTCert ECDSA key in there meaning its likely encrypted.gt So the bootrom or information relating to it stays in the lcache for a fraction of a millesecond after a power cycle. I wonder if chilling the DS would help like it did to help dump encryption keys from Android phones.The IC is not a cache its a bus to let hardware talk to each other some bootrom information goes in the ARM ITCM i.e. the ARM integrated tightly coupled memory which is on the SoC. With it being on the SoC you cant hijack the ITCM for observationmodification either which would be interesting because the bootrom locking code is first copied into the ITCM and then executed from there.I did never think of chilling a DS but its an interesting theory.gt Thats something we can try because the processors share IO dont they? So presumably we could power cycle the Arm and dump the bootrom from Arm or vice versa. I wonder if they use the same bootrom probably not.Very likely not given theres a CFGSYSPROT and CFGSYSPROT. We could try but we dont know how to reset one CPU through the other. We only know how to use the IC to shut the whole system down.gt gt Figure out where the reset line is on the board and hold it for less than the documented time. This will probably lead to massive CPU instability as well so its questionable whether this will yield anything at all.gt I dont understand a lot of this paragraph. Could you elaborate?The ARM documentation says that the reset line must be heldactivated for a certain amount of time to actually shut it down. Some people have theorized that it might be possible to hold the reset line for less time to reset CFGSYSPROT. However the CPU will likely become unstable due to it being partially reset so its doubtful whether we could even execute anything meaningful in this state.gt If we could convince someone in the scene who is reputable like Rei or hundshamer I dont even know who you would begin asking to do this this could be a viable avenue. Wed need someone whos reputation would be absolutely destroyed by running off with the money andor someone who wants the bootrom and has some knowhow to get it.I for one know Id make a run for it big name in the scene or not in the face of a couple thousand dollars.gt Does Bootrom even touch memory? Im not sure.Me neither I only know it touches the ITCM and a hardmod to hijack memory is impossible since youd need to break the SoC apart.gt Other than dbrew is there some place where I could read more about these vulnerabilities?Hang around the relevant chats a lot of knowledge is there but not documented Theres some inviteonly Skype group called CTRdev dsdev on EFnet cakey on Freenode.For other platforms theres usually a dbrewequivalent though I have yet to find the one for the PSP.,3dshacks,d2bdqls,5,t5_2sbkg

7708628,0,t1_d3hm5h1,If youre on . or below you can use NAND backup tools AFAIK OTPHelper Emunand and Decrypt all support it to backup the whole NAND. From there youd just need to copypaste the SD files.However if youre trying to recover from a softbrick you have two options restore a NAND through a hard mod or update to the latest FW. If you update to the latest FW obviously you lose downgrading ability. But youll keep your saves unless you explicitly reformat the system.If youre talking about going from .gt.gt.ALH then following the guide should ensure you keep all your stuff it walks you through backing up the NAND and restoring it later on.If youre going to format the console and not restore a NAND backup later then if you want to keep your saves you need to use a save manager to extract all the saves.Hopefully thats clear. To give an example when I downgraded to . I manually backed up all my saves using a save manager formatted my console and then downgraded. I did this because when I didnt format Id softbrick every time  times in a row. After downgrading I made my emunand and such and then hooked up my NNID redownloaded my games and imported my save files. After that I followed the ALH guide backed up my emunand and sysnand along with my SD files. I followed the process of formatting emunand downgrading it etc. Got my OTP restored sysnand back up to . and then installed ALH. I then restored my backed up original emunand over sysnand like the guide mentions.At the end of all that I still had all my stuff.Hopefully thats clear. Theres two ways to back stuff up. Backup the NAND and then copypaste SD files. This is essentially like a windows system restore. Everything about the console will be restored to the exact point you made a backup. Meaning that if anything goes wrong you can always flash the NAND to fix it without ALH this requires a hardmod with ALH you can do it through software.. Use a save manager to back up all of your save files. When you format your NNID will delink and you can hook it up later on to redownload everything. You cant copypaste SD files as formatting gives you a new NAND key.,3dshacks,d3if3zg,2,t5_2sbkg

7996767,0,t1_d4ev2bp,For question  at the end of Part  you have a . SysNAND. EmuNAND setup. Since you already have this you can follow update Part  to set up Menuhax use Menuhax to load LumaDS and then use Luma to start at Part Part  changes you to . SysNAND. EmuNAND by first downgrading your EmuNAND for safety if something goes wrong you can restore it and then copying it onto your SysNAND. Part  uses a special exploit only available on . to install ALH Technically you need to be on . to access the OTP and you need to access the OTP for the first install of ALH. You can update without going to . and once ALH is installed you copy your original EmuNAND on . to SysNAND. The end result is a system that boots CFW during system boot on .. Future updates are perfectly safe too. Luma which the guide sets you up with protects ALH from all updates.Its actually possible to use both ALH and Gateway. Luma is capable of loading other ALH payloads and Gateway released their ALH payload. Unfortunately Gateways ALH payload doesnt work directly with the newest ALH but theres a workaround.Download BootCTR and put its armbootloader.bin file into lumapayloads as downGatewayWorkaround.bin the name is so you know what it is but the button is essential ignore all the other files in the download go to Gateways beta program page put the . beta on your Gateway and put Gateways armloaderhax.bin file as GWMode.bin in lumapayloads. Finally download this file and put it into the root of your SD card. Your DS will then operate like this If you boot holding no buttons you will launch Luma. Youll be able to install games and homebrew from .cia files to the home menu using the copy of FBI that has replaced the HS app. I recommend installing a .cia version of FBI so that you can use its updater and so that you have a backup option in case anything goes wrong. Youll also be able to get to the HBL from an app on the Home Menu. Its safe to update from System Settings while Luma is running outofregion installs and DSiWareGBA games will just work without any tweaking and online play will work perfectly.If you hold Down youll boot into Gateway Mode. Youll be able to access the games on your Gateway and it should work just the same as before. Dont update in this mode because Gateway doesnt protect ALH. Outofregion installs should still work but DSiWare and GBA VC may fail to load or not appear at all. You can still use FBI to install games same as Luma although theyre subject to the above restrictions.If you hold Start youll get Hourglass useful if you mess something up on SysNAND. You probably wont but its still nice to have a backup option. If you hold Y youll get EmuNAND which you probably will never need again. If you hold X youll get Uncart which can convert physical carts into .ds files. If you hold Select youll get Lumas menu. If you hold L R or B youll get a black screen as Luma tries to do something impossible with your current setup. If you hold anything else youll get Luma.,3dshacks,d4ewvb8,2,t5_2sbkg

8045458,0,t1_d4k9kik,Thats where I would have guessed it connected maybe it functions sort of like a Game Genie in that the game runs through it with additional code running. That would also explain why unofficial capture cards dont use that method theyd need a way to sign the capture programs code which only Nintendo can do. Someone should make a covert game card dumping tool that runs in the background while the system is still able to function normally and have someone run this on their DS when theyll be at an event that uses that card!But the thing is if it does work that way wouldnt it be possible to do this with CFW at a reasonable speed on an ODS? If that method works clearly the system is powerful enough to run streaming code in the background. Or is sending the video over WiFi the only part that makes it slow?Come to think of it if Nintendo actually developed a device that can be used to capture video from any random retail DS and it doesnt require the DS to be opened in order to install why dont they just officially release it as an accessory?

8941817,0,t1_d7mfngj, No you would not need a flash cart to play ds backups. To play DS backups you will need to get a DS flashcart. However development for playing DS backups without a flashcart is going well and might be possible in the not so distance future. While installing CFW you will inject something called FBI which is an cia installer. With this installer you can install cia files which can be legit games and other useful homebrew apps. They act like normal apps on the ds. Yes they will appear in the homemenu like normal games bought from the eshop. Yes again your ds will literally look like before apart from extra homebrew apps. Only slight problem is that if you bought official DLC or official Themes with your Nintendo account any DLC and Custom themes that you installed with FBI will disappear when you access the EShop. This can be overcome by making a new Nintendo account after installing CFW and ALH.,3dshacks,d7moasb,2,t5_2sbkg

You wont keep any saves so you will have to back those savesextdata up on a Save manager like JKSM.So After DSiware Downgrade you finish ALH installation then format to relink your NNID. Redownload all your games then restore those saves. Make sure you have an entrypoint to homebrew launcher. You can use ctr to bypass system version check. Browserhax cannot be used after you get the update browser message.Ods will keep ALH. System transfers do not affect ALH. In the dsiware downgrade you will be restoring a nand backup to get back where it was originally unless that doesnt matter.

Its cheaper than buying new or refurbished from GameStop. Plus Id get some extras out of having a hacked NDS. Thing is Im pretty sure these refurbished DSes come with the latest firmware so I would need to do the DSi Downgrade with my kindabroken ODS.So I have a few questions to ask. Is this setup feasible?

These could be even two separate problems. You could have a loose wire in your top screen. From a SD standpoint Id look at what it freezes on. Does it freeze on Homebrew menufilesprograms? Some arent meant to have the lid shut on them which freezes them or you have something wrong in there that when it runs across it it freezes. If youve done something like a system transfer or reformatting all of that sort somethings funky in there and needs to be sortedremoved and try again.

Just got to the this system cannot participate in a transfer for another  days. screen even though there is  indication of a transfer ever actually even happening. If nothing else Im pretty much back where I was before the transfer on both DSs.

9882594,0,t1_davo31q,Looks like I left something out...DSiWare is sort of a fork in the road. If youre on an oDS at this exact moment theres no way to downgrade directly to .. You have to get down to . to be able to take advantage of the exploit that lets you downgrade that far. Its a multi downgrade system that takes advantage of a couple different exploits all with the main goal of getting that OTP for the ALH install. However if youre on a nDS you have options. You CAN downgrade to . and use the OTP method. Its overall safer to do this and wont brick your system unless you do something to screw it up. But you CAN install it without going down to . by using OTPless. This option is ONLY there on the nDS and it can brick your system even if you do everything perfectly. This chance is fairly small however. If you are on an oDS you MUST downgrade to . and dump your OTP. Both methods utilize DSiWare downgrades but theres some wiggle room in how you ultimately do your install from there.DSiWare is a method to downgrade not a method to install ALH in and of itself. ,3dshacks,davq4oh,1,t5_2sbkg

10177812,0,t1_dbx5ox8,Note With safefirmlaunchhax an arm exploit is now avaliable on .! As soon as an arm kernel exploit fasthax is released downgrading will be possible! Although not even necessary see The FutureThe BasicsThe DS has two main processors an arm and an arm. If you dont know what those are it doesnt really matter. The arm handles everything you see the games that run the HOME menu and so on. The arms main use is to serve as a backwards compatibility processor its what runs DS games. The arm doesnt run games here this is the one exception to the above rule However in DS mode its reused as a security processor. It handles integrity making sure the games that run arent pirated filesystem calls reading and writing to the NAND basically the hard drive of the DS and a lot of other fun things. With this in mind lets talk about the security of the DS.arm userland this is what the games run in. Since games wont ever need to readwrite to the NAND install stuff more on that in a minute or change security checks it doesnt have access to them. Things like menuhax browserhax and game exploits like ninjhax ootdhax and so on are what run here and so does the Homebrew Launcher.arm kernel this is what handles more sensitive stuff but is still on the arm. It has access to anything the arm can do including game installation with the arm making sure the game is valid first but beyond that its not really that useful for much except abusing other functions in specific cases see Single System DSiWareHax. Game exploits userland need another exploit in the kernel to break into this and use everything it has access to things like game installation so long as the arm says the games are OK which they rarely are more on that in a bit since the kernel wont just listen to whatever userland tells it to do. The one thing it is really useful for is breaking into the arm this is whats really interesting in terms of security as mentioned earlier. We need yet another exploit to break into this since it wont just listen to what arm tells it to do. Getting an exploit for this is the real meat of DS hacking since it allows for things like CFW playing backups of your games oh who am I kidding it means piracy direct readingwriting to the NAND useful for very specific things and decryption of content.Hopefully now you have a very basic idea of the DS security. With that in mind lets talk downgrading.The past lt.Downgrading before . was pretty simple it meant an arm kernel exploit. Lets talk about what that arm says its OK meant from earlier.Legit stuffWith an arm kernel exploit game installation is possible. This comes with one major catch the game must be signed by Nintendo. What does signed mean? Well signatures are little things in a file that say that someone made this and it has their approval. On the DS signatures are given by Nintendo. With an arm kernel exploit we can install things that are signed by Nintendo. The not fun part here is that for games the signatures for digital versions games you install to the SD card not a cartridge are console specific. With very few exceptions theyre called legit CIAs well talk about it in a moment this means that game installation is not possible with a mere arm kernel exploit.Legit CIAsLegit CIA files the file format for DS games are files that have good signatures for every console. This means that when attempting to install them with an arm kernel exploit the arm will approve of it. Now heres the fun part that relates to downgrading system updates are legit CIAs. Furthermore the arm doesnt check to see if its an earlier version. Technically not true but its so easy to get around that its not worth mentioning Therefore to downgrade we perform an arm kernel exploit and install the earlier versions of the legit system updates. This reintroduces the last known arm exploit to the system on version . which we can then use.The present .arm gets in the wayOn . this is no longer true. When using an arm kernel exploit which for all intents and purposes was patched out on . to install particular titles system updates arm checks against a list introduced in . that says what versions of system updates are valid. If the title version is older than . arm tells arm to stop installing the title. Due to the way the security system works the arm will obey and stop installing.Sidestepping armBut there is a way hardmod and DSiwarehax. These are both methods of dumpingrestoring the NAND without an arm exploit. Usually this isnt helpful at all the NAND is encrypted and decrypting it would require an arm exploit. However due to the way encryption works in a nutshell we can derive the main part of the OS and only the main part of the OS from an encrypted NAND dump. This is abused by decrypting the main part of the OS dubbed NATIVEFIRM inserting an older version into it then reencrypting it and writing it back. By doing this the version will be on . and arm will no longer use the list.The future what could be done for .Well put simply to downgrade on . without hardmod or DSiwarehax we need an arm exploit. Which is now avaliable! See the top of the page Without being able to tell arm to not use the list theres no way to downgrade via normal software. And if we have an arm exploit there would be no reason to downgrade to . from ..ConclusionI hope this explanation helped you in your understanding of the DS and the particular topic at hand . downgrading. Again if theres anything I missed or you dont understand let me know and Ill fix it. Have a nice day Its a system of permissions. Think of it like this theres a child a parent and a grandparent. The grandparent tells both the parent and the child what to do. The parent tells the child what to do but not the grandparent and the child tells neither of them what to do. arm is the grandparent arm kernel is the parent and arm userland is the child. The child must trick the parent into doing what he wants who needs to then trick the grandparent into doing what he wants.arm checks if the title to install is older than a title currently installed and blocks installation if it is. However we just uninstall the title before installing the new one. Pretty stupid on Nintendos part.The actual vulnerability wasnt fixed but it was made so hard to exploit that itd be easier to find and make a new one.

10512753,0,t1_dczpscb,Short Answer if its an SDHC card itll work without any other steps taken. If its an SDXC card youll likely need to reformat it to FAT and then copy the files from the old card to the new as the DS doesnt recognize exFAT partitions.Longer answer The only thing you need to worry about is whether or not the microSD card you are using is formatted to FAT which is required for the DS to recognize it anyways and Im fairly certain theres people that can help you with that here. I actually swapped the gb MicroSD card my NewDS came with for a gb MicroSD card after reformatting it to FAT because SDXC cards come formatted as exFAT as opposed to SDHC cards which come as FATId suggest dropping back to your standard home menu for now and making sure the new microSD card works before going on. As long as you have NOT done the ctrtransfer you can backtrack to the Home Menu youll just have to redo the steps for getting into Decrypt again,3dshacks,dczqdr6,3,t5_2sbkg

That was really strange.I installed LumaDSALH on my NDS XL about half a year ago following Plailects guide. It was working perfectly up till now. Now when I start I just get a black screen nothing happens. I held down select and my LumaDS settings do come up but when I launch into my sysnand it gives black screen. I was on . before and it kept nagging me to update to .. I think it might have auto updated. Anyone know what I can do? I have a really really old nand backup from when I first installed which I think is empty and is on .x. I dont wanna resort to that so do I havw any other options?,3dshacks,dgykv89,1,t5_2sbkg
