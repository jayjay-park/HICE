Its reasonable to assume that if Aragorn and Legolas had not yet met they would have by then.  Aragorn also adventured in the Far East and South where the stars are strange.  Its possible that Aragorn met Legolas while passing through Mirkwood headed East.

Same as they did with Aragorn and Frodo sort of. I think another thing is that a younger protagonist draws a wider backing because its closer to the average maybe I dont know for sure Im not an expert in anything.Turning one into a heartthrob for a pointless storyline Im not so intersted.I do agree with you though because I would have enjoyed it more that way.

4685424,0,t3_3dry45,One movie as long as it takes a different actor for Bilbo no Tauriel maybe a short cameo of Legolas prince might want to see the prisoners for himself? Bolg as the proper antagonist realistic battle instead of weird cartoony violence where nobody ever once is in danger EVER no not even at the end really realistic amounts of blood these movies went the opposite direction most movies go and had way too little blood and finally for Erus sake MAKEUP PEOPLE! MAKEUP! I want my orcs to be the orcs from LOTR not smooth textured video game NPCs with metal upgrades! I mean the dwarves didnt get upgrades. They got a tree branch they lost halfway through the journey and a hobbit they would have lost about  times if he didnt have a mind of his own to come back. Also more battlepig. And headbutt. And I hope theres an explanation in the extended cut for the magical rams that just appear out of the mist.,TheHobbit,ctl55qy,1,t5_2sfnk

5886205,0,t1_cxr4yuy,gtNobody was reigning in Fran me thinks.I think the responsibilitys always spread across the three Phil Fran Pete and Jacksons just at the visible helm. And its possible the scene looked okay on paper at the time but doesnt work so well after being shot and put together. Good call on cutting it either way.Speaking of where in the BTS is Fran? I thought she never shows herself as a personal rulefamily agreement but I could be wrong. Only skimmed the Appendices and will be doing a rewatch next year with friends.,TheHobbit,cxr7r0v,2,t5_2sfnk
5898276,0,t3_3vv8xm,Im getting some issues from Vimeo over copyright with the Bilbo Edition chapters  the Smaug excerpt and the first chapter remain up but chapter  was taken down. Im debating whether I should counter the copyright claim and argue that Im under Fair Use not sure if it would hold up in court but I have a fairly good understanding of Fair Use or if I should just pursue uploading the rest of the chapters via another service such as ZippCast or something. Any advice?,TheHobbit,cxssq64,1,t5_2sfnk
5898575,0,t1_cxrix5j,I am beyond relieved that the download link worked and that you were able to view the film! Im even more pleased by your enthusiasm over my adaptation it means a lot to me. And in truth I actually agree with you on the recommended cuts. I think a Bilbo Edition . is very feasible with these cuts and I think having a PGversion of The Hobbit is a really good idea for kids. This is something I might seriously tackle in January and I will let you know personally as soon as it is done If youd like to share this review in the Collection of Hobbit FanEdits and Adaptation post itd be very appreciated! ,TheHobbit,cxsu51o,2,t5_2sfnk

11183188,0,t1_deziimf,Yea Ive seen parts of yours. I dont want to watch it in full just so that all my cuts are my own original ideas.I had already seen the Smaug scene however before starting my edit and I didnt want to copy it. I also include Bards arrest though so the That my lad was a dragon scene needs to be in the middle of the Smaug scene to allow for the smooth transition there.Youve done some really creative editing with Smaug exiting but I really want to see him bursting out of the gate in my edit whether hes covered in gold or not.The stitching of AUJ and DOS is impossible to get perfect. Mine is quite different from yours and from an editing standpoint I believe makes more sense while yours makes more sense from a narrative standpoint. Mine cuts from the company flying away on the eagles and Azog screaming I have Azog here but not the fight with Thorin to the scene where Bilbo is returning to the company from his scout at the beginning of DOS. This allows for a much smoother transition to Beorns house but it is a little annoying that we dont see the company getting off the Eagles.It actually makes me wonder what the plan was for the original twopart edition of this scene. They wouldnt have Thorin almost dying and they wouldnt have had the make up scene between him and Bilbo. I imagine thered be a ton of unused footage that wouldve been very helpful for people like us.I dont like having the Arkenstone line in there without the reference to Thorin. Theres no real reason for Smaug to be tempted to let him take it unless it was to see Thorin go mad.Anyway thanks for your comments and wish me luck as I head into the Battle of the Five Armies.,TheHobbit,dezlnyy,1,t5_2sfnk
