3038833,0,t1_coavcpp,No one suggested bodies shouldnt be lootable.PVP consequences and griefing arent the same thing ,grav,cocz2bf,3,t5_34dia

4272700,0,t3_39ngbz,I am in love with this game. Id not heard of it until my friend told me about it on Friday. Needless to say I now have  hours played. Its SO well done for early access. It needs a UI for friends and a better crafting UI but overall Ive had a BLAST building my house and going on dungeon runs. Got my jetpack last night and Im not sure how I played the game before it ,grav,cs791c6,1,t5_34dia
5499525,0,t3_3q35nv,The wipe will happen as the new update goes live. We dont have an exact date down yet but should have one very soon. We will definitely make another announcement before the wipe.,grav,cwem6yq,1,t5_34dia

5689733,0,t1_cx2cg78,Thanks boss.Are you on PvP North America East Universe server?Would kill to find someone with that BP on my server,grav,cx2d7lt,1,t5_34dia
5707566,0,t3_3t9e8w,I actually confirmed yesterday from ubitmonsterGames that updating their info pages is on their todo list. Hopefully this all shows that it needs to be at the top of the list,grav,cx4kuxk,1,t5_34dia
5735266,0,t1_cx7yvv2,Really? I heard that you need to level pilot to get the Doom Buggy blueprint and Ive got neither pilot levels nor the BP and Im farming level  areas.,grav,cx80l3c,1,t5_34dia
5762717,0,t1_cxbeqt3,I was messing around with the armor switching earlier and it actually looks like it just immediately updates your hp when you switch. I think it just looks like youre losing a bunch because the health bar isnt scaling back down. Not sure though.You get Playersoul essence and BPs by killing players. For the BP I think they have to be Rank  and you can only get one per day. Dark Gaia is gotten from Drill Platforms. I dont know a lot about those yet.,grav,cxbf2vd,1,t5_34dia
5763207,0,t1_cxbh44c,So basically you want to carry around a Player soul weapon and Dark gaia weapon and that should cover you for pvp.So do we get player soul weapon blueprints from killing players?,grav,cxbh9lu,1,t5_34dia
5874399,0,t1_cxpntz9,Exactly most drops are planet dependent Low mid high,grav,cxpnypz,2,t5_34dia
5917166,0,t3_3wd88a,Pretty much. I pretty sure its not even endless water as well. After going to the continents edge I jetpacked up really high and could see a very clear circle with the center being the center lab,grav,cxv9sni,1,t5_34dia
