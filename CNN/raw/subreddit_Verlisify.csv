9649939,0,t1_da24vj6,Yeah although it makes me sad even with how easy it is to catch and train Pokmon QR scanner X Hyper Training people will always find reasons to hack. Having the right nature is one. Avoiding capsule farminglevel grinding is another. There will always be reasons for genning Pokemon and the fact is with the new QR scanner patch from SciresM it will get even way easier to inject Pokmon than it was already in Gen . Oh and theyll be even harder to detect thanks to the new Pokball breeding system.,Verlisify,da2jzgv,1,t5_2znm6
