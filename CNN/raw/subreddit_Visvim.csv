5015695,0,t1_cuqgira,Yea it was a pretty shitty experience. My bank had  attempted charges when I had tried to buy my item since two were not accepted Sent an email and noticed that they werent going to reply any time soon. So I went for it with paypal and after that it was fine.Zero communication when ordering something online is truly the worst thing a companyseller can do.In the end I got my order but I think Ill be using proxies to order things now. Since that is most of the time cheaper and at least I have some communication with the proxy.,Visvim,cuqkxy2,1,t5_2vrvh
