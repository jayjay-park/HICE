For me all I did was fill out a simple electronic form might have been through MyStudentAdmin but I could be wrong they accepted it straight away and that was it. I was able to enrol normally the following semester.,UTS,cr16ic0,1,t5_2rzjg

But yeah it could definitely help I guess the more you apply the more options you might get. I think quality of experience you are likely to get at a particular internship should outweigh payment when making these decisions though especially if the difference is small.Let me know if you have any questions as you go Ill always be happy to help.,UTS,cww6anz,1,t5_2rzjg
