6504270,0,t3_44ob94,Thanks for starting this thread a lot of good information present already. Im currently trying to find where to modify the time it takes to clear Alien Debris Alien Machinery etc.. in the Avenger. Im stumped trying to find these values.,xdev,czs39jd,1,t5_3cdfw
6519632,0,t1_cztn4cy,If you ever wanna work on custom skills animations or something small like that which wont require commitmentupkeep Im the Rogue Class Mod guy. Id love to have you on board if you just wanna dabble. Ill give you full authorship credits if you wanna just try your hand at something. I also have a graphics artist guy coming in to work on custom iconsgraphics for future overhauls.Right now I have the class designed to fit the role of scoutflanker. The left tree focuses on hit n run tactics with high burst on single target but high riskhigh reward in the sense that hes still squisy. The right side tree focuses on setting up a flanks and being able to survive while in that dangerous position bonus hunker downs return fires etc. at the moment. I started by filling in some preexisting skills just to get the roles in place and am now working on custom skills.Im installing the first custom skill tonight  A ranged shot that has a chance to either knock unconscious stun or disorient a foe based on their will and a couple of dice rolls. I plan on replacing almost all the skills in each tree as long as they fit their planned role.Anyways Im rambling but Id love to have you on board! Im in charge of upkeep so if you just wanna throw one thing in I can credit you endorse your future projects or lend a hand and you wont have to worry one bit. Im done talking now.,xdev,cztoiwz,1,t5_3cdfw

As for the crash in not sure smoothing groups or lack thereof never presented a problem for me. If you can import even without the smoothing roils you can follow THIS guide to hopefully correct the smoothing groups issue. Might be slightly different due to being UE,xdev,czu0105,1,t5_3cdfw
6524986,0,t1_czu82qz,In terms of how we speak yeah sure youd expect a mod that adds playable orcs to add the option in the race dropdown.However the race you select only affects which face and skin colors are available.On the other hand the options under gender already completely change the body shape of the soldier and the game already checks the soldiers gender to know what to do with their clothes and animations and so on. Adding bodytypes as genders seems like it would be enormously less complicated than trying to use the race options.,xdev,czu8hnq,1,t5_3cdfw
6553536,0,t3_45b3ka,Could it have anything to do with the backpack size line in the soldier ability tree? My custom class uses a grenade launcher and gains the extra grenade slot upon first promotion but if i skip over the first promotion by leveling up the class again before promoting then the slot never appears. ,xdev,czx6tfk,1,t5_3cdfw
6610315,0,t3_465kxs,This may sound like a dumb question but have you made sure that EcosArtPack exists and contains the MidModCircles and MidmodCirclesA assets and that they are archetypes of XCOMPatternsContent. i.e can you open the EcosArtPack package in unrealEd and see those assets?,xdev,d032953,1,t5_3cdfw
