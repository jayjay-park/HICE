11588489,0,t3_630fv7,Hey I think I was the security guard that found you that day. I remember getting a coffee at Bad Voodoo when I saw your father. He looked pale and upset I asked him what he was going on all he managed to say was someone took you. I radioed in the code Ultraviolet still no idea why we didnt call it a code red or anything else in the color spectrum. and locked down the mall. Forty minutes later is when I found you your father looked relieved as if anticipating worse news. I know it didnt have anything to do with Nicole Rivers but hopefully it will help piece together your mystery. Also....We tried reviewing the video feed the cameras cut out from the second you went missing and started working again the moment we found you. ,LincreekMall,dg9k9hb,2,t5_3jrvz
