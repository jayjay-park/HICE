In other words not competing on price with  other sellers. Getting your new listing to rank is a whole other topic. But with so many people starting to PL products from China do you think Amazon will start cracking down on brands and their brand registry program so there arent  of the same products just branded different all having seperate listings?For example maybe requiring a certain level of sales for a brand before allowing it on Amazon under its own brand listing or something?

From my experience as a full timer and the exact things I do in situations like yours....gt but how do you guys deal with the anxiety?Have a cigar take a day off to play golf or do whatever spend more time with kids and wife.  gt My sales are up from last month by about  but theyre still not where I hoped theyd be I had some hot selling items that boosted sales but now my other inventory is moving slower. Look at the positive.  Youve increased sales by !  Thats nothing to scoff at thats hard work from previous weeks paying off.  If some inventory is moving slower take a closer look at it.  Note how much competition there is.  Evaluate where you project the price to be a month from now decide if its time to reprice or ride it out.  Take a closer look at what sold quickly.  Are there any rabbit trails still existing from those products?gt And I have  left to spend but cant seem to find anything!This is a legit problem but a great problem to have.  With a surplus you can afford to do a few things.  Take on a lower ROI fast turn product.  Hold onto that money until you find a winner to move deep on.  Find office products you need boxes labels and buy them in bulk to save money in the long run.  Look at buying gift cards to start building up margins at stores you regularly go to.  Take  and keep it tucked back for business emergencies if youre not already set up for it. gt How do you guys deal with it? I feel like Im worried about my business  anxious to spend my inventory money and hoping things are selling.I would also encourage you to go a day or two without checking your sales.  Obviously still check Amazon and make sure you dont have any questions to answer etc.  Ill sometimes go a couple of days without checking and just totally focus on finding inventory or getting organized basically other tasks that are business related and need to be done.,FulfillmentByAmazon,cpitxbj,2,t5_2zm0r

If you are selling the k units in packs of  thats roughly  unitsyou will have some left over as k isnt divisible by . If you are paying  inbound shipping that means  the shipping for each bundle of  works out to around  per bundle. If you have the manufacturer or someone else bundle them and package them you will be paying a premium for that.

The  month isnt necessarily impossible if you turn it to a full time job but to do these numbers as a part timer is not likely to happen and seem very much on the hyper aggressive side.  Realistically to hit your month  projection it will take a lot of money literally building from COGS of  to COGS of k min if were going by post tax.  Obviously itll take a lot of work and most likely a supporting team around you.

As for how much youll be making theres actually a formula you can adjust on the advanced settings and that takes into account the fees that are applied to your listing. Granted it is a little hard to find the UI on that specific card could be designed better as well. Did you find this page at all? Do let me know. The two free listings is something weve heard before. In the past weve offered more listings depending on where you came to JoeLister from but it seems that there might be enough demand such that well raise the  item limit for everybody. Just to ask though why do you think youd need more than ? Its enough to show you the functionalities of JoeLister so whats the benefit from more? Great input on the  day trial with CC though.

4854083,0,t3_3hbwzm,If you keep a lot of long tail books in your inventory  something will be constantly selling. Focusing only on books with high rankings is leaving a lot of money on the table and not in your bank account. No theyre not necessarily going to fly off the shelves but if you supplement your high ranked stuff with a bunch of long tail items your sales will probably be more consistent. Personally I dont worry about sales rank on books until it starts approaching  million because all a sales rank will tell you is the last time it sold. Someone may be looking for that book tomorrow. Or maybe theyre waiting for someone to list an expensive book at a more palatable price. For example I just recently sold this book  for .. I bought it two weeks ago for a dollar at an estate sale when the sales rank was slightly over  million. Selling long tail books isnt necessarily everyones cup of tea but thats ok.

Amazon will tell you how many units of what to pack in the boxes and tell you where to send them. Best used when you have a variety of products at small quantities to be sent in.  E.g. A Box containing  socks with a mixture of x Green x Blue x Red x white x black.If case packed you have set what single unique SKUFNSKU is in that box and the quantities inside.

5371415,0,t3_3ol8jf,I understand the seller frustration here but I can also see the customers point of view.As an example lets say you went to the grocery and needed to buy eggplants.  For whatever reason they were selling them for  each instead of the more typical  each.  Im making up numbers here for an example I have no idea how much real eggplants cost.  Well if you need them youll probably begrudgingly pay the  because you dont really have a choice.  It would be a pain to find another store selling eggplants or wont be worth the time to drive around to other groceries.But when you talk to your friend or neighbors later you may tell them this story and complain about it.  You may recommend that they dont shop at that grocery in the future because they appear to be price gouging.So leaving the poor review is similar to paying for the overpriced eggplant and later complaining about the high price.  When reviewing a product there are many facets to consider shape size quality durability etc.  I dont see why price couldnt be a consideration that a reviewer can comment on.Not trying to side with the reviewer here but offer perspective.,FulfillmentByAmazon,cvy9blx,-1,t5_2zm0r

That being said our people do convert at a higher rate than normal organic sales to reviewers. And taking a look at some of your reviews in the typical period where reviews come in postblast clearly indicate our people did indeed review your product. I dont have the time to go through every one of the reviews you received in the  days postblast but a random check of several clearly indicates to us based on product review history these are our people.Also for clarification Heathers reference to abuse of our service is specific to individuals who sign up for one month take advantage of the full featured solo blasts they get for that subscription period and promptly cancel as you had done.

6309472,0,t1_cz6qb4y,Hey Brian!  Sure thing!  Always happy to help.  Glad to hear youre taking action.  ampnbsp. For you first order I would just ship it to your place so you can inspect it.  For your next order youll have the listing in seller central so you can create a shipment before hand and AMZ will tell you which warehouses youll need to ship to.. To be honest an inspection of the first unit off the assembly line is best because after a factory creates and entire order they will not want to go back and fix everyone.   inspection at the end is better than nothing multiple inspections it better than .  At some point you have to weigh the riskcost as well.. This depends how good of a customer do they think you will be?  If they only think youre going to be placing an order of  a few times a year they dont really care about you.  If theyre under the impression youre going to be ordering containers each month theyll likely take pretty good care of you.  Most of us fall somewhere in between.  Contracts help but arent the end all be all in China.. Amazon has means to protect against theyll automatically credit your account back no need to worry about this.ampnbspThanks for the product suggestions already working on a couple of these ,FulfillmentByAmazon,cz6te5d,4,t5_2zm0r

FBA only for now. my brother and his friend started similarly. about k though. they bought little trinkets and stuff toys selfie sticks cell phone cases etc.  after  months neither was able to leave their FT jobs and theyve since stopped buying as they were not able to sell anything.

Of course I dont have the book with me anymore to double check this.Think theres a way to word this so Amazon will remove the review or is my only hope to ask the customer to do it?

That means that the packaging isnt designed to be shipped and that one of the ways they kept cost down was reducing packaging cost. It also tells me there is some risk that it might be broken in shipping and that when I am handling it personally I need to be careful. If you are getting a fair number of broken items look into bubble wrapping them. If your margins are so low that you cant do that you probably shouldnt be selling the product or you need to increase your price to cover the bubble wrap. ,FulfillmentByAmazon,d0xa4ek,6,t5_2zm0r

I murdered my chinese hijackerNot really but his ass aint selling anything on Amazon.How I took him downI looked through the items he had for sale and he had a few PL products that he sent to Amazon. There were ish reviews for these products each clearly through a review site.The items were knockoffs of another more well known brand  and included most but not all of their branding.So i ordered them same day shipping and took some photos. Sent them to amazon explaining these were counterfeit knockoffs of the more famous brand... Less than  hours later got an email that this seller and all his listings have been removed.I really didnt think that would work. I didnt think amazon would care since it wasnt being sold as the well known brand  and I wasnt the brand owner anyway.But they did. They cared so much they deleted maybe suspended? his entire account. He has zero items for sale.Hope he lost a shitload of money. He sure cost me a lot.

The sales price and fees will be perorder.When you use Power Query to join your transaction report file with your COGS file youre going to get a new report with a line for each order in the transaction report.All its doing is looking up the items sku cost in your COGS file and adding that column to your new report.The tricky part would be if you have multiple different costs for the same SKU. Then you have to decide to either use FIFO LIFO or average the costs.As an example these are the columns they give you    datetimesettlement idtypeorder idskudescriptionquantitymarketplacefulfillmentorder cityorder stateorder postalproduct salesshipping creditsgift wrap creditspromotional rebatessales tax collectedselling feesfba feesother transaction feesothertotaland for my Sales and COGS sheet made with power query I filter out everything but type order and add  columns Price Per UnitCOGSProfitI use a similar method to create sheets for reimbursments refunds balance adjustments shipping etc.Heres an image showing what I end up with.

9549961,0,t3_5bnbko,I am relatively new to Amazon specifically but on other marketplaces and websites depending on the circumstance I would do it.I mean if it requires little work and prep why not?I like to make a chart with blocks.  Each block is a product that you have time to deal with.  If you have  blocks and  are full it doesnt hurt to have another product since you have time and space for it.If all  are full and you need extra time or space for products which have a larger profit margin it would be best to send it to the chopping block.At that point like someone else said you can send another person with empty blocks the product and get them to take care of it on a  per sale kind of basis.Since Im newish to the ecosystem i would snap it up in a heartbeat since it is a quick mover to help me get more established but a seasoned vet with less time or space to deal with low ticket items like that wouldnt want to touch it because of plain old time management issues.The money and time could be better spent elsewhere.If I were you I would keep it going until it becomes a bother thoughGood luck!,FulfillmentByAmazon,d9q8acg,1,t5_2zm0r

On top of that as you said you improve on Amazon so that may make up for the few sales you lose on Ebay due to higher pricing. Rank is everything on Amazon.I personally find option  attractive.

Customs does not send a bill  clearance and duty payment is done at the time of import and that is what you need a broker for. Choosing a forwarder that is also a broker will help you to streamline things and know the costs ahead of time. As someone mentioned above suppliers in Asia are known for getting the goods to the port and then after that you are on your own. It can be very costly if you dont proactively have a plan of action for clearance and delivery. Depending on the value of your shipment you may also need a Customs Bond for clearance and you can generally purchase that from your broker directly. ,FulfillmentByAmazon,da1njc0,2,t5_2zm0r

When you click on a reviewers name above their review youll see a character string that beginswith the letter A in the URL. For the reviewer below Im using one of the top reviewers for myexample the customer ID is ALYZJWYS. Youre going to want to copy this to the clipboard.. Next go to Seller Central gt Orders gt Manage Orders. Well need to do some filtering to make thematching process less painful. Click on Advanced Search enter the SKU for which the review wasleft and change the date range to ordered in the last  Days. Click on Search.. By default the search results will display  orders. Were going to want to increase this to  onthe bottom of the page again to make this process go a little faster. Now comes the fun part.... Right click on the white space next to any order on the page and select Inspect or Inspect elementdepending on which browser you use. Hit CommandCtrl F to use the Find feature on this inspectwindow. Now paste the customer ID from step . If the order thats connected to the review is on thisfirst page most recent  orders you will see  out of  in the find results and the order ID andcustomer info that corresponds to it will appear a few lines above the customer ID.If the order is not on this page you will have to click next back on the Manage Orders search resultsto see the next  orders and repeat the process above.MOREAs an addition to what I just wrote To see if your customer reviewer already submitted a productreview...On the order details page gt copy link location of the Contact Buyer URL sellercentral.amazon.comgphelpcontactcontact.html?orderIDampbuyerID ALYZJWYS ampmarketplaceIDABCDEVXYZRCopy the buyerID PASTEbuyerIDHERE ,FulfillmentByAmazon,dbqd9xs,5,t5_2zm0r

10520845,0,t1_dcymyl6,Generally there is a correlation yes. And yes this is how jungle scout makes its very tough estimate of monthly sales. But be careful there are other ways that a seller may temporarily boost their BSR. This is less common now that people arent doing giveaways. Just be cautious if the product seems too new or if it otherwise seems too good to be true. A useful backup check you can use is called the  trick. Go to one of those competitors items and add it your cart as if you were going to buy it. Then go to your shopping cart and change the quantity from  to . If they have  or less in stock youll see an error message like sorry there are only  of these left. Write that number down clear your cart and do the same thing the next day. That error message number should be a little lower the difference between the two numbers is a good estimate of how many units sold in that one day. If there are multiple sellers on that same item or if there are more than  units in stock this method will not work. Good luck with your product research! ,FulfillmentByAmazon,dd0ngn3,1,t5_2zm0r

It looks like you may be able to claim tax credits for any service that Amazon provides regardless of whether they are provided via internet from the US or in Canada and regardless of whether they have claimed sales tax from you in the first place.Amazon does not include an GSTHST or PST breakdown for advertising costs but more interestingly neither for the  referral fee all sellers pay as well.

It shows that you care about your customersproducts. Its also a good idea to tell them to message you directly so you can take care of the issue too.Be sure to use your seller account though if you have separate seller and buyer accounts.
