2586224,0,t1_cmw5c65,It might be that theyre trying to simulate that energy weapons ingame heat up metal armor like power armor. But no idea. I just accepted it as a rule to balance power armor so its not always a clear upgrade. Theres a movement penalty but its not too bad in endgame. ,Wasteland2,cmw5o9o,2,t5_2tq7k
2611656,0,t1_cmw5o9o,Power armor is terrible and wearing it only got my characters killed in the endgame. Its just awful. Its not useful against any group thats actually a threat to your party.,Wasteland2,cmzhb4l,2,t5_2tq7k

5455360,0,t1_cw8lv5v,gt Rose  ugh the scientista PoS at that What? Rose is awesome. Intelligence of  trained in Alarm Disarm and Computer Science and armed with a pistolshotgun hybrid which appears to be the only one in the game for some strangeass reason youd expect the Mule to work the same way.Give her Energy Weapons some First Aid Surgeon Alarm Disarm and Computer Science and watch her go.Rose is so amazing I actually restarted my Highpool run because I couldnt stand being saddled with Vultures Cry.,Wasteland2,cw8z2mn,3,t5_2tq7k

8026661,0,t1_d4i9hqu,Yes I played the coop but its best to play it online as playing this game on the same TV means your screen will be split. So having a screen to yourself would be ideal so playing online is better.In this game you can split your team into parts and they can be in completely different parts of the world like three guys thats being controlled by one player can be in a dungeon on the other side of the map in battle while the other character being controlled by the second player are in town buying shit taking to NPCs and shit. The coop is certainly unique for this type of game.,Wasteland2,d4i9sv0,1,t5_2tq7k
