Someone sees someone else doing something illegal and instead of going through the legal methods of reporting crime decides to fight lawbreaking with lawbreaking and then refuses to stand trial for breaking the law because they dont think they did anything wrong doing something morally right doesnt make it legally right. Snowden wouldnt have gone to the police he would have gone to an official higher up the ladder than he and then a special committee which would hear the merits of the accusations. Instead Snowden broke a legallybinding written oath not to reveal information on classified documents didnt even bother reporting any wrongdoing to the appropriate people impersonated NSA officials to get clearance to documents he didnt have clearance to view and then stole documents and fled the country. Snowden is not legally classified as a whistleblower and therefore not given the protections afforded by the Whistleblower Protection Act None of it is undeserved.

545461,0,t3_20ddtp,Its stupid because no one is banning Tesla cars theyre banning well it was banned well before Tesla entered the market manufacturers from selling to consumers directly. Yes it does mean that Teslas sales are indirectly banned but its just so incredibly disingenuous for people to say that Tesla is being banned as if theres a law that prohibits only Tesla cars from being sold. This legislation existed before Tesla entered the market its not like lawmakers in New Jersey scrambled to pass some stupid law in order to stop big bad Tesla Motors from putting Johns Auto Sales out of business. If they want to argue that the legislation gives dealers an unfair advantage thats great but dont spin that shit to make it seem like Tesla is being directly targeted because theyre taking sales from dealers. Seriously fuck this brand of alarmist journalism. Whoever spews this drivel and actually thinks theyre constructively contributing to the subject ought to feel ashamed.Edit After doing some more reading apparently I was mistaken as to when the laws were passed. Based on this article it seems like any new dealers need to obtain a franchise agreement before they sell their cars. Knowing this my opinion is a little different since I dont really know when the bill was introduced and whether or not Tesla was indeed selling in New Jersey prior to the bill being drafted.

3026947,0,t3_2uu36s,gtId like to think women getting into MMA have a slight advantage over the men as now is the time where WMMA is still somewhat green that you can make a name for yourself relatively quick compared to the men. Nontheless making it as a fighter regardless of gender is difficult enough. And I dont know about boring but majority of the WMMA fights arent boring. Technique lots of times gets thrown out the window and they just go at it. Really exciting in a way.I love that this guy managed to sneak in all these backdoor insults. He starts with the classic men have it harder due to this roundabout reason jerk and then tries to throw a positive statement in there by saying how anyone becoming a fighter is hard. But of course he throws in that little comment regardless of gender. Okay true but it reeks of bitterness. Plus MMA is obviously a male dominated industry. So if a young woman is looking to get involved with MMA maybe it would be good for her to hear the stories of other women who are succeeding in a field with a majority of men. But Reddit hates anything inspirational that cant be conveyed in a maymay or in a post with the word fucking every  words.

These laws have been made in a social reality that simply didnt take into account samesex parents sperm donation and other new social inventions so theyre bound to malfunction when the very reality shifts around them.

They give a critique of the media which they see as portraying the Democrats and Republicans as equally obstructive when it is obvious that the demogoguery is one sided  almost everything ted cruz says is not true and the danger of government shutdown and government default is mostly the GOPS fault. the authors have been studying congress for decades so its not like Im a partisan trying to bring down the GOP I find the democratic party to be very problematic as well.

6967193,0,t3_4b4l9n,Then theres this shitgtwelp that doesnt surprise me. the game itself is ok but the story has some of the craziest SJW bullshit in there which doesnt even make sense and makes the story unnecessarily worse.....Here we gogta the female doctor tells you that shes a lesbian in a situation where theres no reason to tell anyone what you prefer to fuck. its so awkwardly misplaced its just embarrassingShes not walking around with Lesbian written on her shirt nor does she ever say Im lesbian btw. What she actually says is something along the lines of My wife says Im better at pathogens than I am with people. Nobody wouldve given a shit if she said Husband. I knew after hearing this line someone somewhere would be fuming.gtb therere TWO audiologs where a woman confesses for the st time to her mother that shes a lesbian as if anyone in this world would still give a fuck about it. men watch lesbian porn for ages and love threesomes with bisexual girls. so who the fuck are they even talking to?TWO audio logs! TWO! PC culture gone wild I tell ya.gtc and this is by far the worst! muahaha...... the Rikers are a gang of inmates who took the opportunity to break out of jail in this chaos. theyre some of the worst criminals who kill and torture anyone who is unfortunate to run into them.gtand now comes the funny.... their leader is a black womyn! LMAOgtcan anyone imagine what would happen to a woman who runs into a group of criminals who were in jail and didnt fuck a woman for years? hint they wouldnt make her the leader. what the actual fuck!Shes leader because she was the one to break them out of prison.gton top of that theres a scene which implies that shes cutting off the peen of a policeman. yea sure... they had to tell this but therere so many random women in the game staying in the middle of the street in this anarchic chaos and not a single one of them gets raped even though everyone knows that would be the first thing to happen.This guy for some reason really has a problem with people not being raped.gtthese parts were obviously written by a fat angry SJW lesbian with short blue hair ugly face piercings who also tweets killallmenThis crybaby really has something against lesbians.,circlebroke2,d162fhv,26,t5_2tzax

To be clear when I said I find it to be lacking I mean it isnt philosophically rigorous but I think we may have a misunderstanding of terms since nihilism is pretty widely used.When I said existential meaning isnt real I meant nihilism like Schopenhauer the belief that the human condition is cold and painful suicide is good egoism etc. Im guessing frysion meant nihilism in that sense as well since that is the common usage of nihilism without an adjective.When you say existential nihilism you mean something akin to Kierkegaard Sartre and Camus right? Or would you include Schopenhauer under that description?edit my questions are in good faith hopefully it doesnt come across as JAQing off,circlebroke2,d19jq34,1,t5_2tzax

I mean our country has a lot of problems but these people have only become politically interested in the last year or so for the most part and dont know about how politics actually work. Now I understand what they are going to and fit the demographic almost to a tee white male straight just turning  this year but Ive been following politics since I discoved that the newspaper had other sections than the funnies as a kid. That and I read a lot especially history. When you have this background knowledge you can recognize that some sacrifices must be made for your final goal in order to get it started. You cant just go all the way and expect it to work with no resistance. If you look at the myriad struggles in this country all of them have taken time. Black rights started with buses well technically slavery but thats not really Germaine as it took a war Gay rights started with not being arrested for being gay. You have to start and build momentum when making a movement not just make a lot of noise. Our political system is slow to change but constant pushing can make it change. These people want change now damnit! They dont realize that even if Sanders was elected he wouldnt get even a tenth of what he wants done. Obama tried to overhaul the healthcare system and had to drop public option to get his own party to vote for it.   They see Hillary has the establishment as what they see as the enemy. As what is stopping their change. In reality she is their closest ally. She is a smart abd savvy politician who could get more of what they want done than Sanders ever could. Instead of attacking her they should push her to enact those changes. They arent going to get everything they want but theyll get more than they would with Trump for sure.  In the end they are in a position to turn this into a movement. They as the voters have the power in this equation. They can use this to get more left leaning people into congress and the house and into state and local legislatures as well.

The point however is to change it.I understand if you consider further discussion to be fruitless given we seem to have an entirely different worldview. But anyways the fact that in the world as it is video game makers can only make a money from having IP does not mean this is a right way to do that and because the world currently has intellectual property ownership does not mean this is a right thing nor does it mean the world will always be like that. Matter of fact the first step towards creating a world that is potentially better is by criticizing the notion that the current state is right.Im not writing a defense of piracy and it is apparent that you wont agree with a critique of IP anytime soon but if there is a message i want to pass it is this No one should refuse to critically analyze their moral viewpoints because they believe they have be the moral highground by default this is completely selfdefeating. And in the matter of piracy the idea that the antipiracy side is righteous by default is a view that can and ought to be critically examined.

8632792,1,t3_4y2d8c,Judging by the top comments there isnt really any of that at all just classic redditors being skeptical about stuff as usual and I mean Im pretty skeptical too because they didnt exactly show any data to back it up.It probably would take an actual miracle to have a sudden influx of female readers from  percent to  percent in only a matter of eight years especially when the Marvel movies only really entered into topgrossing lists when the Avengers came out  years ago. The comic book industry has always been hampered by the major marketing problem that plagues both Marvel and DC. So telling me that Marvel added  to their female fanbase when theyve only gotten a hang of how to use the internet to deliver comics and advertise them a few years ago? I would be pretty skeptical too.A huge reason why Carol Danvers got really popular after turning into the new Captain Marvel is because Marvel actually made a big deal about it. Captain Marvel wasnt even in the ballpark in terms of popularity before Carol Danvers took the title whether he deserved it or not. You know why? Its because Marvel actually announced in  that Carol Danvers is finally Captain Marvel. Which resulted in more and more new readers were really interested in the idea because of how Carol was already a well established character where hardcore comic book fans spread the news by word of mouth. This also happened to DC with how they already started a another reboot because the last reboot five years ago The New  actually sold pretty well in terms of preorders for the books. Why? because they actually took the time to announce it and put up ads for the event. Plus letting new readers access all these comics on their phones or tablets. However It seems that the only thing DC took away from the announcement is that reboots will always sell well because of the value of it being new.,circlebroke2,d6kpfbr,-2,t5_2tzax

9629347,0,t1_da00jph,Heres the thing. You said Trump is Hitler.Are they in the same family? Yes. No ones arguing that.As someone who is a politician who studies conservativism I am telling you specifically in politics no one calls Trump Hitler. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying Hitler family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Radicals which includes things from Ben Carson to Ted Cruz to Jeb Bush.So your reasoning for calling Trump Hitler is because random people call the conservatives Hitler? Lets get Mitt Romney and John McCain in there then too.Also calling someone a centerist? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. Trump is Trump and a member of the radical family. But thats not what you said. You said a Trump is a Hitler which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the radical family Hitler which means youd call Ted Cruz Jeb Bush and Ben Carson Hitler too. Which you said you dont.Its okay to just admit youre wrong you know?I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

And working class issues are antiracist feminist and LGBT issues.Some people have tried to create this artificial divide between socialist view points and antiracis feminism and LGBT liberation. There forget that socialismanarchismcommunism have always been the political movements most willing to fight for these issues. In the s and s it was the Communist Party that put the struggles of black folk in the USA front and center of their platform many of the early th century feminists were socialistsanarchistscommunists such as Lucy Parsons Mother Jones Emma Goldmann Alexandra Kollontai Silvya Pankhurst and Hellen Keller. Although the far left has had a spotty record on all of these matters particularly LGBT liberation no other political tendency has put as much effort into being inclusive. Leftist and communist partiesmovements were among the first political organizations to openly advocate for LGBT liberation in the late s. Such as the Black Panther Party in the USA and the Irish Republican Socialist Party in the Republic of Ireland.This stupid false dichotomy needs to end. Womens liberation the end to white supremacy and LGBT liberation are essential parts of the liberation of all humanity and the overthrow of capitalism is essential to all of these struggles.,circlebroke2,dae9ja5,3,t5_2tzax

He whispers in my ear Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. He grabs me with his powerful hands and places me on my knees. I am ready. I organize a labor union for Karl Marx. He throws reactionaries into the gulag. It hurts so much but I do it for Marx. I take up arms against the bourgeoisie. I want to contribute to the revolution.

11249517,0,t1_df73rb7,In all seriousness youre preaching to the choir. I kept asking in the announcement thread what the difference is between posting to your own userpage versus posting to your own personal subreddit. They replied with the followinggt One big thing here is that much like your user page is your own and a part of your identity here this allows content creators a space for sharing that is completely connected to their identity on Reddit.Thats exactly what a personal subreddit does. There is no difference. Additionally you can simply restrict commenting and posting privileges in a subreddit. Also you can change the design and layout. This change doesnt offer anything new anything that couldnt already be done. So why do it in the first place?Well the conspiritard inside me thinks that Reddit may be looking to push certain users to a higher status ie Digg v and their power users. Sort of giving them preferential treatment. Which takes away the one component that sets this site apart from other social media sites. That is content generally rises on its own merit rather than on the merit of who posted it  though some Reddit celebrities definitely get a small boost from username recognition.,circlebroke2,df7473y,34,t5_2tzax

So yes while to this date they are  white they wont be in the future if they keep taking in immigrants and refugees.gtI guess its not inherently terrible to want to preserve your culture but at the same time excluding people for something they have no control over like the color of their skin is kinda shitty especially if they have roots there.There are plenty of places where they can belong though.  I dont expect Saudi Arabia or Japan to allow mass immigration of people who dont share those countries values.  In my opinion the United States is already too far gone even in  short years I dont expect the United States to ever be a white ethnostate.  I would accept having the US as a multicultural country since not much can be done about it.  Europe on the other hand can be saved.  But they have to stop immigration and refugees.gt If the majority of the population doesnt share your sentiment as well then your opinion doesnt really matter anyway.Thats why were trying to spread our message.  Many people dont even realize whats going on.  gtFair point and I apologize for criticizing you for that. That was unfair on my part. I appreciate you making an effort to take in dissenting views.Thank you.,circlebroke2,dfhc69f,0,t5_2tzax
