10120103,0,t3_5ktxei,I think it depends on how competitive a player you are. If you simply enjoy playing through content theres quite a lot of it to do each day and its not one of those games where you need to race to the endgame because thats where all the content is. Ive played pretty much all the major MMOs and it hasnt been since vanilla WoW that Ive enjoyed the leveling experience this much. Take this with a grain of salt though its quite possible the grind gets pretty tiring after a long time and we havent had the opportunity for that in the CBT.If youre a very competitive player in terms of needing to be on the top of rankings and whatnot then it remains to be seen how competitive fp players can be once the cash shop opens. ,RevelationMMO,dbqnnpg,4,t5_3exry

10487487,0,t3_5q6xjq,Hopefully there is almost none of CBT left so buying into that specifically may not be worthwhile. But in terms of the game itselfThis is the most purely derivative game you will ever play. There is not a single thing thats new in this game that you havent seen elsewhere.However thats not necessarily bad. What it does offer is a unique combination of good things from other games. I dont know of any other game that offers all or even most of Structured PvE content dungeons raids narrative quests Structured PvP content objectivebased battlegrounds ranked arenas Complementary group roles tanking healing support dps Multiple significant mechanisms for customizing your abilities Complicated and meaningful gearing choices Player to player trading Complex crafting and gathering Good graphics and design there are obviously subjective preferences here but by the things that can be measured objectively it is better than most A seamless open world for things other than specifically instanced contentAnd less critically but still nice Choice of tab targeting or aim targeting Autopathing optional and slower than manual navigation FlightTheres not a single thing on that list that doesnt appear in multiple other games but I dont know of any other game that has anywhere near all of them.Pretty much the only thing it doesnt have is weirdly grinding.

Im more of a PvE player but Im also pretty casual nowadays so I think sticking to releveling and daily dungeons will keep me entertained before the mans start really mattering too much. w I always hoped BNS would introduce a noncombat focused aspect of the game i.e. housing more engaging crafting some sort of friendshipmarriage system but its not a huge issue when combat is fun.

If you have already bought the decisive force exp pack in the cash shop the only other way to get bronze shards besides PVP weekly boxes is to buy the aurum box that gives bronze shards. For  you will need to buy argents with bronze shards and use red tickets  aurum each to combine.
