11055495,0,t3_5xv6tj,Thank you for finally getting this done. My family never has the radio off in the car. know when to get off XD A few months dang. Cool but hella long. You are definitely lame for just wanting water. Eat it how it is supposed to be that is really cool advice and totally true. What places do you absolutely have to visit? Nars you are terrible. Forgetting your brother thats pretty great. Ahhh loser lol. And that does sound like an awesome dream road trip. As someone who has never left the state they reside in it is very cool getting to hear all your little stories about exploring places. Thanks Nars for answering it! ,AudioHaven,del4e8s,2,t5_3fgke

11403942,0,t3_62qmkt,Congratulations sleepy!Not entirely sure how to feel though...will I get more sleep now? Itll probably take a few weeks to adjust. Ill miss this whole postaday thing but it should be survivable...Im probably not the person to give any advice about motivation to attend classes but I can at least say you seem like youre a fair bit more together than I was at that age. As long as you do what feels right for you it should work out fine.,AudioHaven,dfomf2h,3,t5_3fgke
