Im partial to the creative option but the input is varies wildly as it is and boils down to Theres a con coming up so I did a thing  I was bored so I made a thing  look at this thing I think is cool let us have an insightful and provocative debate about the nature of art!In any case I expect itll take some planning and effort to make sure it gets off the ground.First off is there a basic need for this? I know theres a JP site for time attacks do they allow content from non JP players? Are there sites for other languages countries?Second how will content be generated? Obviously theres the by monster basis but what about ongoing interactive challenges? If we tally up just the hunting quests how many time attacks can be made on a weekly  monthly basis? Will there be incentives? How will info be catalogued? Rules can probably be copied from the JP site.Third how will content be advertised? Being in touch with or having one of the admins be a youtuber who can set example speed runs could be very useful. Are there other online MH communities who would be willing to join reddit to contribute if they can get over the redditness? Then theres minor things like moderators getting a snazzy theme defining parameters for peripheral content etc.. Itd be amusing to have the occassional competitive egg run.. I dont really recommend incentives people come to expect them and its a whole host of other issues. . I did bring it up because the arena offers incentives in the form of unique gear that some dont know about. Unfortunately the arena is kinda downplayed in the games themselves being stuck in a corner somewhere. Some easy early content might go over arena rewards and advice on soloing.,monsterhunterrage,d3d8x1p,3,t5_3a2f0

8697051,0,t1_d6sfjoo,I think that maaaaybe its also that for a large population of the community whichever style you choose doesnt really affect the game so much. Maybe there are too many casuals who just play however they want and dont care. Yes there are styles that are definitely more effective and will dish out more damage such as Bowshido gt all other bow styles but maybe Capcom is aware of this and allows it. Maybe its not that they couldnt balance it so well but that they let the game design stay the way it is. Im sure its hard making  hunting styles for each weapon and balancing them all to make all  viable. Some styles really will shine for specific weapons such as Bushido for bow  gunners in general because you dont want to be getting up in their face to vault on them. I understand your rant but I guess we just have to accept it for what it is and just play the game the way we want. ,monsterhunterrage,d6srgpq,1,t5_3a2f0

9094635,0,t3_54tzkm,the problem is that gunning mechanics are still very obscure and obtuse to the average player without extensive research.  The only place the game hints to the existence of critical distanceTHE main factor to know if you even want to be decent at gunning is in the training quests which are entirely optional and missable.Im going to go on a limb and say that most crap gunners stay crap because they only play in multiplayer and perpetuate a DunningKruger circlejerk.  shameless wikipedia linkWhen hunts are going well most crap gunners dont critically analyze their performance.  Nah the hunt went well cuz of their lt snipin skillz.  Why question yourself when most hunts youre on are succesful?  and they will be succesful because no one wants to fail hunts unless theyre trolling.  Why even bother learning or even researching anything about gunning when youre convinced that youre a good gunner and other hunters should suck your dick for being a gunner?If they soloed they would VERY quickly realize how much they suck.   They would realize that offensive skills go a very long way in lowering ammo consumption and that picking the wrong gun isnt just a time waster its a recipe for failure.But in multiplayer they never ever have to realize that or even face any of that. others sadly pick up the slack.tldr  crap gunners are so crap they cant even recognize that theyre crap and the cycle persists,monsterhunterrage,d8512bw,5,t5_3a2f0

11790135,0,t3_67z9cg,And that is why I always recommend solo playing before online playI dont think youre a bad Hunter you obviously have the will to progress but you feel frustrated because you cant.Someone in the comments suggested that you spend some time observing more than fighting monsters and I totally agree with them.The thing with MH is to not consider it like a simple hacknslash game. You have to learn more about your opponents and be able to react in response to their attacks.Speedrunners have near perfect knowledge of Monsters AI allowing them to realise those awesome hunts and making you question your abilities as a result.But you dont have to be like them or at least not entirely. Like I said knowledge is power  learn the basics of monsters attack patterns and youll be good to go.Back to what I said earlier playing with other people tends to make you rely too much on them not always but stillThats why I usually recommend new players that they test their skill alone before going online.Why ? Because not only the monster will be focused on you and only you provided you dont use palicoes making it much more predictable. And also because youll be able to judge the extent of your skills better than in a group.Plus playing solo is so much more rewarding than playing online because whenever you succeed at something said success is yours and only yoursAbout your weapon choice... Try everything out and see what suits you best There should be tutorial quests in Bherna village iircOh also stick to one Hunting Style for the time being. I suggest Guild until you get a better hang of the game,monsterhunterrage,dgwg9ia,1,t5_3a2f0
