8538738,0,t3_4wlz7n,Fyi the butterflourmilk part is called bechamel sauce. Its the basis for a ton of things.If you cook the flour and butter for awhile I.e. wait to add the milk then the flour will start to brown and add a lot of flavor. This is called a roux and is used for things like white gravy of the biscuits amp gravy type or as a base for gumbo. I probably wouldnt do that for mac amp cheese though.,cookingvideos,d68wqxh,0,t5_2u7xf
