5696633,0,t1_cx0eyrt,Fair point. But you can reach  CDR with Essence Reaver  Zeal  Sheen and I think hes strong enough at that point. It scales into late game better than Shiv and Sheen makes trading a hell of a lot better. Ghostblade is something I forgot I definitely have to try that. ,LucianMains,cx3804q,1,t5_385uh
6080768,0,t3_3wmrfm,Your build is pretty good but I do like taking lucidity boots instead of bezerkers to hit the  or in some cases  CDR cap. And as for lane you play it aggressive. If you get ahead you push your lead very hard by using e aa q or q aa combo since both will proc thunderlords. Most ads wont have an answer for that trade if you have an ad advantage on them.,LucianMains,cygo6cs,1,t5_385uh

7922703,0,t3_4nr00b,This is what I build and it so far has a  win rate for me over  games. I build  GB gt BC gt Berserk grieves gt RFC gt GA and then to finish it off Lord dominiks. This build absolutely shreds tanks and the amount of burst is redicoulous.,LucianMains,d46l4wa,1,t5_385uh

10092504,0,t1_dbmz8it,Plat elo k Lucian main here. I really recommend you trying out IE into atk speed item. Dont even try to touch reaver. Yes you will have less cds but you will see the difference in dmg that ie provides. I switched to IE  Stattik and then i go either lwbt or like this guy i go botrk if they got heavy frontline. It works fine.,LucianMains,dbn2ia1,4,t5_385uh

10679238,0,t1_ddf7uz4,how come u are the only one with EoN in your build I thought after the lethality buffs every adc was running EoN as a core item?,LucianMains,ddhhdns,1,t5_385uh
10889274,0,t1_de35bee,Ermmm yeah Ive been using fervour this patch as well tbh cause the extra AD gives you more damage on ult and Q so its just really nice tbh I did take thunderlords by accident one game and it felt good though.,LucianMains,de35g83,1,t5_385uh

11090494,0,t3_5yaig8,TriforceBork never was a good build imo but Bork first item is really good now IMO I think you can either go normal crit after like ER  RFC  IE or the pen route like BC  ghostbladeEoN  RFC  IE,LucianMains,dep3jda,1,t5_385uh
11148334,0,t1_devi33s,Have you tried BotrK instead of GB? Its a little more expensive but the lifesteal Slow on Active  that bitty damage extra AS and Tank Shredding capability makes it comparable to Shiv if you put it together with the Casttime changes you have a Lucian dishing damage really fast and melting any tank thats in front of him also the extra AS helps stacking Shiv Faster and the Bonus Damage can Crit iirc so its not a bad buy at all would say that it outshines GB in most aspects with the exception of Squishy Bursting and even then the AD it gives  the Active help at that.Also the MS it gives is DEFINETELY Superior to GB partially because it slows the enemy and because it gives more MS than GB.Give it a try see for yourself maybe youll like it?,LucianMains,devnh03,1,t5_385uh

11286113,0,t3_61084i,I think its fine for lane since you will probably be against a melee and this build shreds tanksbruisers. After laning though when its time to group your team will lack a traditional top laner for a front line. It can work though if you jungle andor support can play front line if not though I think youd just have to get super far ahead and close out the game fast otherwise the better team comp will win.,LucianMains,dfb9j4a,1,t5_385uh
11310908,0,t1_dfe15cb,Thats how win rates work as you climb.  More games and harder opponents make your win rate go down.For example I have  win rate on Lucian right now after  games. Despite a similar win rate last year it went down to  after a couple hundred games.,LucianMains,dfe2oat,1,t5_385uh
11487820,0,t3_63wzk2,Ferocity  Fury Self explaining. Fresh Blood For that sweet lvl  powerspike and trades altogether.  VampirismNatural Talent Against poke heavy enemies I run  Vampirism else  into Vampirism and  into Natural Talent. Battle Trance Better than Bounty Hunter for snowballing so you get those first kills easier. Can be exchanged with DoubleEdged Sword if you want to have less extended trades and more short bursty ones. Battering Blows Again selfexplaining Fervor of Battle Synergy with Lucians kit is too great to not take it at any time.Cunning Savagery You want to push the lane early so you need that  extra damage. Also helps with lasthitting. Secret Stash Youre mostly going to be fighting v so Assassin is not going to be of much use the added Sustain is much better. Merciless For that added surprise Burst. You also dont want to spam your spells needlessly so you shouldnt even need Meditation. Dangerous Game Should be selfexplaining too.,LucianMains,dfy55ui,2,t5_385uh
