7871293,0,t3_4438p8,Med student here Ill break this down as simply yet accurately as possible. Pls let me know if I make any mistakes and if theres anything that is unclear.ketones  acetone acetoacetic acid and betahydroxybutyric acid. ketones in chemistry include more molecules specifically any molecule that has the structure RCOR aka a unique carbon chain connected to a carbon doublebonded to an oxygen and single bonded to a different unique carbon chain but thats not super relevant to us. Acetone is the simplest ketone and will give your breath a sweet smell sometimes seen in extreme type I DM. A normal diet includes all the macromolecules carbs lipids and proteins. AAs are not stored so those that are not used are excreted in urine. Lipids are stored in adipocytes and carbs are stored in muscle and the liver as glycogen. When your body is fasting it must maintain a minimum level of blood glucose to feed the brain and RBCs. To do this is first breaks down the livers glycogen stores into glucose and then exports the glucose into the blood. After that really during the tail end of it your body relies on gluconeogenesis initially liver only but in an extreme fast up to  can occur in the kidney. Glucogneogenesis is the process of converting AAs or their complement ketoacid into a glucose molecule. This is fueled by FA boxidation which converts a FA into an acetyl CoA molecule. That acetyl CoA molecule will sent into the krebs cycle to produce NADHFADH which can enter ETC and lead to ATP production ATP   energy currency of the body and fuels gluconeogenesis hence why you have FA degradation accompanying this process. In increased FA degradationBox seen in ketogenic diet or diabetes mellitus you get excessive FA degradation and thus increased acetyl CoA production. Some of this acetyl CoA cannot enter the TCAkrebs cycle for a number of reasons decreased substrates increased NADH max capacity etc. so the excess acetyl CoA is converted into ketones. These ketones can be sent into the blood and utilized by the brain which reconverts them into acetyl CoA to enter the TCA make NADHFADH which enter the ETC  ATP. Ill pick up here later and simplify this a bit more. The most important energy substrate in the body is glucose. It is absolutely imperative that blood glucose is maintained between ..mML or  mgdL. This is because glucose is the only neural substrate for energy caveat with ketones will be addressed later. When you fast your blood glucose lowers as the brain and RBCs along with other tissues continues to take in glucose through their GLUT receptors. These tissues always need energy to live so theyre continually ingesting glucose and thus blood glucose will begin to drop. To maintain blood glucose first insulin levels will drop. This means glucose will not be able to enter cardiacskeletal muscle or adipose tissue bc these rely on GLUT receptors which are insulin dependent these tissues can also can get glucose in through GLUT receptors which are ubiquitously expressed but this is minor in comparison to the amount of glucose the remove from the blood when insulin is present. This will spare glucose in the blood and reserve it for essential tissues like the brain or RBCs.Next if glucose continues to fall bc you are fasting glucagon will be released cortisol GH and epi too but these occur slightly after and just compliment glucagons action. Glucagons action is to promote gluconeogenesis or the conversion of AAs or ketoacids like oxaloacetate or pyruvate into glucose. This occurs in many tissues throughout the body liver intestine kidney but only when it occurs in the liver and kidney can the glucose that is made be used to replenish the bloods supply only the liver and kidney have GLUT receptors that allow for the expulsion of glucose into the blood AND enzymes for gluconeogenesis. The pancreas for example has GLUT receptors but not a significant quantity of gluconeogenesis enzymes to create glucose and export into the blood.Glucagon also leads to the activation or phosphorylation of hormones sensitive lipases in adipose tissue  enzymes that break triacylglycerols TAGs into free fatty acids FFAs and glycerol. Glycerol can enter blood directly it is hydrophillic and go to the liver where it is converted to glucose or reesterified into a TAG molecule. FFAs are hydrophobic so they must be bound in blood by a protein  albumin for example  and in the blood they can go to many tissue types  muscle or liver for example. No matter where they go they will be degraded into acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA can enter the TCA and eventually you get ATP.Now that you understand the molecular basis of energy generation and maintenance the ketogenic diet should make sense. If you do not ingest carbs the glycogen in the liver will be close to . This means if you fast your blood glucose will begin to drop and since you lack glycogen stores youll go quickly into gluconeogenesis fueled by fatty acid degradation in the liver to maintain blood glucose. This will also lead to ketone production which can be used by the brain as fuel. In the ketogenic diet increased fat is promoted bc it will increase the transcription of enzymes involved in fat degradation. To get this to happen you not only have to ingest a high proportion of fats but these fats need to be small chain or medium chain up to  carbons and not longchain. Long chain fats enter lymph in chylomicrons and eventually are transported into the venous supply bypassing the liver. Chylomicrons can deliver these longchain fatty acids to adipose and muscular tissue and thus youll increase your bodys fat composition. Now medium and small chain fatty acids can directly go from your intestine into the portal vein and into the liver. This means they do not go to adipose or muscular tissue first. In the liver if you are low carb and in a state of ketosis these fatty acids will be converted into acetyl CoA and ketones to fuel gluconeogenesis and as an energy substrate for the brain. If youre not in ketosis then these will likely get packaged as VLDL and distributed to the body. Of course this still happens if youre in ketosis but much less VLDL will be distributed plus VLDL and chylomicrons rely on LPL at adipose tissue which is insulin dependent so if youre low carb then you wont be able to deliver lipids to adipose tissue caveat  protein also causes a rise in insulin less than carbs but still it is important to keep protein low if you want to keep your insulin levels down. Anyways I hope this shed some light on things. It ended up being a lot longer than I expected but I think it is pretty thorough. Feel free to ask questions or highlight any mistakes I may have made only a second year student. Tldr no tldr read it mother fuckers. Biochem is cool and worth understanding.Cheers!,ketogenic,d40t0j1,1,t5_2u6nx
