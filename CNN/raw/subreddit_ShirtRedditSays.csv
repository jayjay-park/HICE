I dont think theres a sub with better CSS...small suggestion could the hover box with all of the controls and stuff do a topdown gradient from that pink color to transparent? Right now the box covers up part of the shirt below when it appears and its a bit distracting from the shirts.edit nevermind that sounds like a lot of work.,ShirtRedditSays,cilesi3,1,t5_2v6lq
