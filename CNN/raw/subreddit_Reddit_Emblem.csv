I need... to hang back and get... healed.The mercenary limped into the freshly opened cell and kneeled by Dolour. Heh... He uttered a faint wheeze. Sorry to bother you Dolour but I am in serious need of medical attention.Gazing out the doorway Duncan saw the massive feathered figure of the hawk Reaper circling the center of the Viaduct. A sense of primal dread coursed through his mind from the mere sight of him again. He had done his best to suppress his fear thus far in the battle but was beginning to feel his grasp of these mental reins slipping. Widened eyes frantic breaths and constant surveillance made this development alltoo apparent to those nearby.Of course his mental state was not helped by the four monsters that descended from the sky crested by foreign soldiers. Their massive winged forms elicited both great curiosity and despair from Duncan.Whwhat in the World are those... things?! How... how could I possibly fight something like that...?Slowly he rose from his spot in the cell and clenched his teeth and fists. He couldnt let himself slip into this weakness. He would have to hold out until the mission was completed.I ccant... I need to persevere.,Reddit_Emblem,dejn5g8,1,t5_3bgb4
