2519528,0,t3_2ohgyx,I was using FTEdroid and went to look for the link and stumbled upon this at the play store. It gives you a choice of Dark Places FTEDroid or QuakeGL and I must say well worth the .. If you want free google ftedroid.,quake,cmnfvnn,1,t5_2qzfl

6918039,0,t3_4afvfh,I cannot recommend a modern sourceport to play the game on enough! It fixes all these issues and makes the game work a hell of a lot better on modern machines. Quakespasm is my preferred engine but there are others out there too!   Download the engine for your operating system and extract the zip file contents to your Quake folder in steam and then run quakespasm.exe,quake,d10he78,5,t5_2qzfl

8388241,0,t1_d5q2o8w,But in this case you called this game an Overwatch clone.A game can have some sort of class system and still be competitive. Its loadouts that affect competitive play.

8441398,0,t1_d5wpmhh,Gotcha.  I never played vanilla so I wouldnt know.    Watching demos was another problem.  Have the mapmaps needed to watch whatever WSVGother event demo you have?  Too bad you need the exact map pack the server had in order to watch.  Youd also need to mess with netprediction or whatever command it was in order to get smooth playback. Also I hope you liked dropped sounds because you might not hear a lot of hitbeeps or item pickups. ,quake,d5wpp6y,3,t5_2qzfl
