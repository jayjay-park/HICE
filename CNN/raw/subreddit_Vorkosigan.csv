5076189,0,t1_cuxnhzj,Well I would still say Shards of Honor which was her first book or Warriors Apprentice.  Shards is her introduction to Cordelia and WA is her introduction to Miles.  All of the other novels in the series build off of those.  Yes she wrote a bunch out of order but there are some key things about their personalities and past that are explained in those two novels that are helpful to know going into the rest of the series.  Some of the later books are definitely better written but WA is still one of my favorites and a good introduction to her writing.,Vorkosigan,cuxveq6,4,t5_2u3c6
