I subscribed to him back then because pewdiepie was becoming more and more popular and Dashie was a youtube gamer who wasnt screaming or overreacting like pewdiepie. I was enjoying watching his gameplays because he seemed like a real person. But now its just fucking awful. Sad too because I dont know how many old viewers are actually still watching but the new subcribers just have no clue. ,DashieXP,d4tj72y,2,t5_2vbck
