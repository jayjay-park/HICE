2514418,0,t1_cmjqdld,No the Tsukihime anime has a different reaction.See the Tsukihime anime is not a bad anime really. Its plot is pretty good Even when it grabs random stuff from other routes and puts in some of its own its animation is decent and overall its not a bad anime.The problem is its something of a piss poor adaptation. The plot is centralized around Arcuids route Which theres nothing wrong with in and of itself unlike what most people think about Fate and from what I remember it pulls the major reveals from the other routes and puts them in where it would make chronological sense for them to appear but without the establishing emotions from those routes the reveals are a bit flat.But the main issue is that they more or less just gutted Shikis personality. If you imagine a more vulgar Shirou Not offensively so but Shikis not ignorant or people coming onto him to say the least without the stubborn stupidity and misogyny Whether you think Shirou is misogynistic notwithstanding you get something close to what Shikis like in the VNs. And really considering most of Tsukihime is discussion and world building that personality is what made people stick around. But in the Anime Shikis a flat personality with no real traits he goes through the same events that he goes through in Arcuids route but without the emotions surrounding it And his conversations etc they dont have any weight to them.Thats why we say theres no Tsukihime anime Because theres an anime that covers events in a route but theres no anime that has what made Tsukihime what it was to us....You know thats a whole lot of talk for something that doesnt even exist.,fatestaynight,cmmrtwm,1,t5_31xwr

2846988,0,t1_cnr8gkl,Id imagine it depends on what youre learning it for. If you plan to write collegiate level papers in Japanese then yeah learning it from something like anime probably isnt the best. However if youre interested more in just conversational Japanese then I would say animemoviessimply talking to people is actually even better. You learn how to actually use the language and adapt to that conversational style rather than just take what youre trying to say and translate it from English to Japanese. Sort of like watching animeJapanese TV or a Japanese person watching English TV teaches you more how to think in Japanese while a school teaches you how to use your thoughts in your own native language and just turn it into the other one.But of course the differences much more depend on how serious you are in practicing both of the different styles.  ,fatestaynight,cnrpa3d,3,t5_31xwr

I personally chose not to vote here because I am in between potentially even leaning towards the side of keeping it. The only reason Id say to stop would be more if you yourself find it annoying to do. The ones who actually could use the walkthrough are much smaller than the people who have already finished the VN. I have no personal use for it and when I say I Im speaking as people who have read the VN but others do like it. So its going to appear as if a ton more dont want it when in reality its mostly because the majority of posters here already read it so vote no since they themselves dont need it and drown out the minority that do want it.

Creation of something from nothing Genesis. Infinite parallel worlds. Materialization of the soul. Time manipulation. For both point  and  its not the fault of the novel but rather youre choosing to ignore the entire multiverse. The appeal of the Nasuverse is that all the elements are connected. Fate didnt need to go into the entire magusreachtheroot explanation because Kara no Kyoukai already had it etc.... s Because it was still fully in their calculation. They shouldve just curbstomped everyone with the literal all the evils in the world and win the war. If it was still a Servant it couldnt have done anything to the Grail. They didnt expect to summon a wimpy human that died on the first day. The grail became corrupted in the first place was because Angra Mainyu was a human.

So expect more focus on the servants past lives and personnalities wishesmotivations in the present and battles against other servants instead of masters ideals and ways of life. Of course this is just an overall assessment some masters are really interesting just like some servants are in FSN. Of course my point is only relevant for what has been translated so far meaning the first two volumes that you can find here and k words of third volume.

3743305,0,t3_338ekg,Killing Sakura there and then is something the other Shirous would not do either. Shirous ideal is truly to save everyone not everyone  Sakura. I mean the choice was Sakura has a crest worm inside her and COULD turn into Zouken puppet at any time to go and kill people not she is Zouken incarnate at the moment killing people . Note what Archer said about his justice he wants Shirou to be aware that his justice and societys justice are not the same. Shirous wish is not to see anyone in his vision to cry that desire is independent of the ideal. Shirou above all else wants to actively save people seeing numbers pop up doesnt make him truly happy so he would rather take a chance than directly shatter the ideal by killing a what if and bear the pain of failure if he fucks up. Kiritsugu is the one who kills what ifs and takes no chances destroying his ideal straight away. Shirou will be truly on Sakuras side when there is a choice where people are actively dying at the same time and he chooses Sakura still.  Really Shirous mindset isShirou lt everyone else  and changes when it meets reality into either  Shirou lt minority lt majority  or    Shirou lt everyone else lt Loved ones lt Sakura The underlying problem that Shirou views himself last on the food chain doesnt and will never change so people writing it off as growing up from fate to UBW to HF are simplifying the development its simply another path his insanity takes.   Also everyone else lt Illya in unconditional love mode. Best girl.,fatestaynight,cqiymln,4,t5_31xwr

3912429,1,t3_357fsn, Do you have prior moderation experience on Reddit? If so list the subreddits you moderatehave moderated.Answer I am currently one of the Head Mods over at rUnusualArt and have been a mod over there for about a year now so I have experience with unique posts and spam posts. We are just about to break k subscribers I also currently sit idle on the subreddit rDojoOfCoolness which will be UnsualArts next project. How long have you been subscribed to rfatestaynight?Answer I have been lurking on the community for about a year now and subscribed about  months ago. I only starting becoming more active and checking things out during the nd cour of UBW. How many times a day on average do you visit rfatestaynight?Answer I check reddit from my phone while Im at work or out in town and rfatestaynight is one of my regular subreddits that I routinely visit to look at the current discussions or see if there is anything interesting being talked about shared or happening. Why do you feel you should be a Moderator of rfatestaynight?Answer I feel like with my experience as a mod on a decently busy subreddit helps boost my qualifications for being a mod here at rfatestaynight but my overall sense of judgement maturity and ability to follow rules instilled upon me by the US Navy puts me above most candidates because they have not received the training that I have in major leadership roles. I also have an excellent availability currently as my only job right now is to attend a  hour class once a day from pm PST to pm PST. This allows me to cover a huge range of times from the evening to the early morning. Have you read the VN entirely? Have you read FHA?Answer I have read the VN entirely as well as seen all the animes currently produced. I was going to wait on reading FHA for when the movie came out so that I could compare the two but with the amount of free time I have at the moment I may begin it in the near future.Thank you for your consideration and if you have any questions feel free to message me.

4135239,0,t1_crrmqhp,gtA sequel also known as a followup is a narrative documental or other work of literature film theatre television music or game that continues the story of or expands upon some earlier work.gtsequel  skwln.. Something that follows as a continuation especially a literary dramatic or cinematic work whose narrative continues that of a preexisting work.gtsequelskwlSubmitnouna published broadcast or recorded work that continues the story or develops the theme of an earlier one.gta literary work movie etc. that is complete in itself but continues the narrative of a preceding work.gtthe next installment as of a speech or story especially   a literary cinematic or televised work continuing the course of a story begun in a preceding oneThe entire point of the word sequel is to talk about a work that came AFTER another work that continues the story of it. Thats what the word means. It does not when referring to any literary work refer to a story that comes after. That is an outdated definition of the word and it is not the one we use for literature. The definition most commonly used for literature is used to refer to a LATER work. Not an earlier one.And do bear in mind that these definitions are referring to the works involved not their content. A preceding one doesnt mean preceding events in the work it means the preceding work as in the work that came out previously. You cant really stretch the phrase an earlier work to mean the events of an earlier work because the subject of this discussion is NOT the events but rather the work itself. Fate Zero is not an earlier work than stay night  the WORK Zero was created after stay night period. The events may happen before but were not talking about the events were talking about the work itself.That aside the word sequel also has certain implications and connotations. It implies that the thing that is the sequel is the derivative work that the thing youre calling a sequel came after.By calling FSN a sequel you are implying intentionally or not that it is not the original work and that it is itself the continuation of Zero which it isnt especially not thematically. The only thing about SN that is a continuation of Zero is the chronological timeline. Thats not the only relevant part of the story. Zeros themes build upon SN not the other way around. If SN is a sequel its an awful one because it takes the themes from Zero and largely ignores them even taking them backwards in many ways.What it comes down to is that sequel implies came after. Saying SN is a sequel implies that Zero came first that Zero is the base work and that SN is the derivative and thats simply not true.Its not that hard to just say that Zero is a prequel to Stay Night. Nobody will be confused by that I promise. Theyll be a lot more confused if you tell them it has a sequel that came out many years earlier.What it comes down to is this The word sequel absolutely implies that the work youre describing came after whatever it is a sequel to. That meaning is unavoidable no matter how much you try to say it isnt. That implication is simply not correct when referring to stay night. By those many definitions I provided earlier stay night is not a sequel to Zero.However Zero IS a sequel to stay night. It is a sequel which takes place chronologically earlier. This makes it a prequel. A prequel is just a type of sequel that takes place chronologically earlier than its predecessor.I said this several times in this thread but the Godfather is not a sequel to the Godfather Part . Not even if you watch Part  first. Part  is a prequel and takes place earlier but that doesnt make The Godfather a sequel to it thats clearly ridiculous and needlessly confusing.,fatestaynight,crrmymf,1,t5_31xwr

4199419,0,t3_38x5ii,FZ Rider would easily win this. In terms of combat skill hes almost certainly the better fighter. While FSN Rider has her one moment of glory in HF usually shes probably the weakest Servant in SN. When comparing Noble Phantasms FSN Riders Bellerophon isnt much stronger than FZ Riders Via Expugnatio so it wouldnt be much of a factor in the fight. Her Mystic Eyes are only useful against very small groups of nonmagic resistant opponents as they require a lot of prana to use so Ionian Hetairoi wouldnt be affected. Breaker Gorgon would be useful against FZ Rider but if hes summoned his Ionian Hetairoi it would just mean that FZ Rider himself wouldnt attack her while the rest of his army would slaughter her. ,fatestaynight,cryxfan,0,t5_31xwr

4368223,0,t3_3b1jep,I read a summary on wikipedia that spoiled all the servant identities and plot of fate route a significant number of years before I actually played the game but I didnt see a single character sprite or screenshot. My headcanon was based entirely on videogames that Ive watched my cousin play like Heroes of Might and Magic and Final Fantasy.  I believed the Rider fight took place in this huge red curtained opera amphitheater and she had a onewinged angel style last minute transformation into her true s gorgon form.All the fights took place like Final Fantasy boss battles where the person just waited in the boss stage for Shirou who I imagined looking like a ginger Cloud.s Gilgamesh looked like Final Fantasy s Gilgamesh aka huge monster dude and the s Gate of Babylon looked like s a giant solid stone gate with complicated locking mechanisms that shot out swordsThats about it because I forgot about this weird headcanon until after I finished the Fate Route and thought it was vaguely familiar because the game looked and played absolutely nothing like my  year old headcanon based on a summary for a game I didnt play.,fatestaynight,csi1828,11,t5_31xwr

You are a Caster slabbed in the middle of Fuyuki you know there are  pair of potentially power masterservants who want you dead.  What would you do?But you have pointed out that advantage of not exposuring her hideout is less than taking advantage of draining mana. which makes what she did perfectly logical.

It is the last resort Shirou uses.Indeed it sounds dumb but because the writing was subtle enough. The idea is good but it wasnt executed properly. That is the problem when you dont go deeper in the meaning of the actions and stay in the literal meaning.Spoilers As the route advances despite Saber being in more danger in each fighting Shirou stopped saying that excuses because he respects Saber and admire that she is fighting. The deeper meaning is that Shirou is abandoning that survivour guilt and is willing to fight along another putting both of their lives at risk for the greater good.

Its futile however as you could have every counter guardian in existence go up against Archetype Earth and they wouldnt be capable of killing her.KnK takes place in a different timeline but its still the Nasuverse which is a multiverse.

4988565,0,t3_3j93i5,I agree with you that Prisma Illya is not as good as FSN or FZ but its pretty different from those . Its a magical girl spin off. Its still enjoyable but its no masterpiece. Either way it gets better on the second season in my opinion. So far the third season has not been great because there have been a lot of fillers but its starting to pick up. As for the manga I dont read it but I spoiled myself on something that I dont quite understand I just know its probably going to be amazing. If I was you Id give the second season a try. If you really dont like it its completely understandable. Im pretty sure its cannon. I tried to type an explanation on why but I was doing pretty bad at it and not having english as first language doesnt help. Think of it as a route in FSN. Everyone of them is different yet theyre all cannon. Since you said you have played the FSN VN I recommend you playing FateHollow Ataraxia. Its a VN that happens  months after FSN.

5330741,0,t1_cvt1k8n,I think were missing each others point here. We agree hes outside of time. But I dont think its as though hes loaded there from the moment of creation. I think he still has to make the pact w the CF first to get there and is then available across all time including his own pastalternate routes.Looking back on it my point B doesnt make a lot of sense since even if he killed his younger self hed still exist outside time but I still dont think its possible for him to be summoned since he hasnt been pushed outside the time axis yet.Either way I think its highly unlikely EMIYAS th War Archer class Servant was EMIYA since he never had his ideals challenged and while this is route is similar to Fate I cant believe that if Archer were summoned he wouldnt say something to Shirou or anyone as soon as he recognizes its his original timeline. For this reason I think the FateIllya route theory with Ajax still mostly stands its just been given a bit more detail and a lot more questions in typical Nasu style.,fatestaynight,cvt28v4,3,t5_31xwr

5346000,0,t1_cvuzqn4,We already have the anwser for that outcome and it is Archer.That is when Fate ShirouArcher just undestood Saber motivations but didnt experienced her past  Im going deep in speculation so bear with meThe closest reference we have for that Archer route is the Unlimited Code route for Shirou and Saber Here we can see that Shirou and Saber were never romanticaly involved and just parted like close partners. Saber could come in terms with her past but not her future. As for Shirou he continued with his wish of being a Hero of Justice but just because the promise to Kiritsugu Archer and because he didnt experienced Saber past he didnt fell in love with her and didnt cemented why he wanted to be a Hero of Justice. So how can we reach the conclusion that he didnt experience Saber past?. Well if we assume that this route is indeed were Archer comes from then in this timeline Saber tells Shirou her motivation first hand. That changes the outcome of many things as we see that Saber fights Berserker alone and thus after that they start sharing dreams more Shirou never experiences Sabers past.Finally this is all with the assumption that this UC route is where Archer comes from. Now we have the similarities that Nasu described but there is something more if we want to get really deep. At the end of the UC Shirou route he reaches his conclusion that he feels that not much has changed but he will Walk with his head held high looking at the sky ... So ... whats with that? Well in the Archer character song he uses that same phrase Held your head high up in the sky This phrase is never used at the end of the Fate route or any other end. Still this is pure speculation.So what changed in Fate Shirou in order to have his conclusion lead him to a path different than Archers? Thats right being able to see Saber past and fall in love with her. And because that answer is the one that doesnt let him fall in despair as Archer it is the same as UBW because both accept the outcome and continue to feel proud of their path.,fatestaynight,cvv0fl7,9,t5_31xwr

You can use the books for more detail and not to tell you what happened or fill in a rather wide blank.But the UBW anime just doesnt Partially because of directorial differences but also because the VN stories are meant to build off each other so that while no one story tells everything they all will tell you everything.

5429557,0,t1_cw5me3c,Not really anime is made for Japan and UBW was a late night show it definitely wasnt made for a mainstream audience. TypeMoon is huge in Japan nowadays most otaku that is the niche market to which anime is targeted probably already read the visual novel. It was written with that market in mind yes and yes thats the reason we had the Hscenes in the original visual novel because otherwise it wouldnt sell. However youre thinking about FatePrototype a draft Nasu made long before he even started writing Tsukihime or Kara no Kyoukai. IIRC the whole genderbent Saber thing was actually Takeuchis idea but the plot for the whole visual novel was obviously written with some cornerstones in mind and among them are Sabers identity as a genderbent King Arthur. While I understand that you and many other people dont have the time patience or even want to read a  hours visual novel to understand the whole plot I still think that Shirous and Archers character is much more developed thanks to the monologues provided by the text format. Even if you dont want to playthrough the entirety of UBW you can probably watch a Lets Play that includes the parts in which they are most relevant and important and I personally would recommend at least doing that. I agree that Shirou is unlikable. That is at least at first. In Fate he was suicidal with his whole superhero thing but the worldbuilding in my opinion compensated for his personality though I see how someone who already watched UBW or FZ might not feel the same way since they already know all the twists and explanations the Fate route provides. In UBW he improved a bit and his conflict with UBWs Archer solidified both characters and made them in my opinion likeable. I can see why someone who already watched the UBW anime might not feel the same way since Miura didnt want exposure so he went with a show not tell route for the series that ended up omitting monologues that I consider important development of the characters. However in HF I believe Shirou is a genuinely likeable and wellwritten character. However HF!Shirou cannot stand on his own. He requires support from UBW!Shirou to be a truly interesting character thanks in my opinion to the believable contrast between the two versions of the same character. I can understand why someone who watched UBW might not want to read that route though. It builds off the Shirou developed through monologues in the UBW route and the idealistic superhero Shirou from the Fate route the first which was concealed by the anime and the second rightfully considered unbearable by many VN readers. I dont worship Japan As a matter of fact I dont agree with their cultures ideas and habits I simply find the development of such a culture or nation to be interesting as well as its results. I enjoy both visual novels and novels but they are definitely two different mediums united simply the text format. The visual novels typically build off the route scheme to tell a whole story while novels generally have a single plot wellmade and that generally dont leave any plot holes. I think you would probably enjoy a kinetic novel more which is basically a visual novel without choices leaving way for a more conventional and wellbuilt story.,fatestaynight,cw5ojq0,4,t5_31xwr

Can Command Spells be used on any of the Servants? Hypothetically if someone was bound to two Servants would the magus be able to use four or more Command Spells?A Even when contracted with multiple Servants a Master only receives three Command Spells assuming none have been stolen from other Masters etc. so you cant have four Command Spells for a single Servant or anything like that. Also theres nothing wrong with concentrating all Command Spells on a single Servant. The problems begin after all Command Spells have been used up.Illyas CSs are just huge. AlsoQ In Sabers route there was a scene where Ilya was frightened by Gils appearance and her Command Seal was described as glowing. Is this because Ilyas Command Seals are different than those of other Masters?

6104698,0,t3_3z65qn,Kirei Kotomine was a man who was never really satisfied with his life. He both had no desires beyond making others suffer and had a strong moral compass. Even when the latter stopped holding as much sway as the former after the events of Zero it didnt go away. The tension between the two always created a certain amount of self loathing within Kirei even if he didnt show it much. IIRC at one point he says something to the effect of God will have to answer for creating me. With that in mind I think he smiled because he was okay with dying because deep down hes always felt he deserved it.For his laughter in Zero throughout his life Kirei has suspected but hoped otherwise that he was an evil man. Then the grail granted his hearts desire by destroying everything around him. His laughter was him expressing the sentiment Holy shit I really am a complete bastard. Fine then Ill run with it. It was the confirmation of his greatest fears on a scale that he couldnt even begin to repent for. Its only natural that he felt he had no choice but to own it.,fatestaynight,cyjjilq,3,t5_31xwr

6149551,0,t3_3zo8to,Now followup post that is kinda silly.But if I can pick a fictional character to be my servant it would beWilly Wonka as a Caster.Willy Wonka being a modern retelling and face of an older character being the Pied Piper of Hamelin man with the enchanted flute who make you visualize your own dreams when you hear its music or tasted his candies.Willy Wonka and the Pied Piper themselves being part of their own form of grail myth both of them are magical fey like beings within a world of desolation a wasteland of lost of hope and imagination.With the pied piper it is the rats who have destroyed all the crops and spread disease.  Adults promise to pay the piper but reneged on their promise thus the piper has the last laugh when he takes away the only thing more valuable than the land itself their children from which all their hopes and dreams and aspirations lie for children are why adults live it is a form of immortality not concerning your self but someone else.In effect this character would be in effect spreading his own magical items around town but these items kinda work as a reverse form or reality marble modifying the senses and making you see a true reality but also a skewed reality that you end up being your own downfall.  Aka the itemcrafting of the caster class.And Willy Wonka true power is his territory creation where you must assault him on his own homeground which is his chaotic factory.I personally see this fictional character being an awesome servant if worlds collide and we can do fiction mixing.,fatestaynight,cyon1bb,3,t5_31xwr

6808516,0,t1_d0o0imu,EDIT This is the completely wrong part! Check below for the correct one!Allow me.ampnbspFateZero Volume  Act  ampnbsp... Without the slightest hesitation Saber leaped into the air dashing out through a baptism of flying lead bullets. The stray bullets of unimaginably destructive power tore open a large hole in the cement of the ground and walls. That power obviously could not be spoken of in tandem with the weapon that Maiya had used. Saber sensed that even though she was a Servant if she were hit she would be fatally wounded she gnashed her teeth in anger.... Berserker nimbly and freely operated them as if they were extensions of his own hands. The firearms structure and holster were all immersed in the hated prana and had turned into fierce magecraft military equipment that could threaten even Saber.... The bullets faster than the speed of sound were still unable to surpass the speed of Sabers sword. Nevertheless the speed of twentyodd bullets per second left her only able to parry.... Saber was so restricted by the curtain of bullets that she could not close in she looked around in search of a method by which she could return from certain defeat. Then she saw a small truck parked in a lot at the corner of the car park. Thats it!Accepting the risk that she could be forced into the corner with no route of retreat Saber dashed toward the vehicle she had set her eyes on. Berserker pursued her as she fled at the same time shooting at random with the firearms in his hands. Saber made a ferocious step that narrowly preceded the howling bullets dashing to the back of the truck. ampnbspSo the answer is that shes neither dodging or outrunning them  shes parrying them. And at  bullets per second at that. The text also seems to suggest that once Saber actually starts running for the truck Berserker isnt really giving it his all to hit her which gives her some leeway.Keep in mind though that the fight in the LN is pretty different from the anime fight. The VN starts Berserker off with the two machineguns and thats all he has for the entire fight until he draws his sword but in the anime he first uses a sniper rifle although its more like a cannon for him if I recall correctly and then the two machineguns. Therefore Saber is able to spend her time dodging at the start of the fight and then just run for the truck so theres no parrying in the anime. ,fatestaynight,d0o1ijb,7,t5_31xwr

Well Kiritugu and Kirei has demonstrated that in their showdown.  Upon being hit by the origin bullet mystic code that specifically burns magic circuits the command seal on Kireis arm got destroyed. This shows that command seals are magic circuits.And if command seals are magic circuits they will reject magic so whoever possess command spells on their body will have a certain degree of protection against Blood Fort Andromeda. No you wont be immuneBy the way Sakuras magic circuits are superior only when shes dark Sakura.  When shes normal sakura her void circuits lay dormant since she has been retrained by Zolgen and has the Makiri magic crest translated onto her.

7669237,0,t3_4k9q0y,Alrighty here we go. Plotwise? He was too proud to actually wear it when facing mongrells and preferred wearing his favourite outfit. In reality it was just done for plot reasons. Note that in the Fate route he wears the armor when slaughtering Caster Hollow Ataraxia spoilerVN Spoilerv and Assassin  Kuzuki. Whilst wearing the armor Shirous chances of victory would reduce drastically considering even Excalibur has major issues getting through it. Nope due to being reincarnated thanks to the grail he no longer needs mana to sustain himself in this world. However he does need extra mana for the Noble Phantasms. Youre making a wrong asusmption here. He has been given a human body but that doesnt mean hes no longer a servant. He still is. As to the question wheter or not he is a mage datamining has revealed that Gil in FateGrand Order will be able to be summoned as a Caster soo... Guess hes sort of a mage? Too early to tell... This part is often headache inducing but whatever. One of the main reasons why Gil lost to Shirou apart from not wearing his armor not using Ea UBW being a counter etc.. Was him being overwhelmed by the fact that a mere could pull of a strong counter to the GoB AND fight on par with a servant something that could be considered impossible. Following this he lost his composure which put him at even more of a disadvantage. After cutting off his arm Gil tries to reach for Ea again and regain his composure. Shirou however knew that this combined with his very limited amount of mana woudl spell his doom. Literally saying Ill lose if he regains his composure. VN Now the headache part Gil vs Archer.it would mainly depend on how serious Gil would be and his use of  things his armor and Sha Nagba Imuru He who Saw the Deep The Omniscient Omnipotent Star. Think of it as LibraScan from FF but on steroids. It tells him everything about a servant. This would also tell him all the details of UBW with which he would learn that it actually isnt a fully perfect counter to the GoB since it has some weaknesses of its own. Namely he can only project what he sees which makes approaching Gil more dangerous due to him being able to fire GoB from any angle including behind the opponent which cant be blocked if he projects anything besides bladed weapons it costs him bout three times the normal amount of mana a reality marble is very mana consuming though the actions within are less consuming in general.Quick side note If were talking end game UBW Archer would actually be too weakened to take on Gil especially due to being masterless which he knew So if Gil were to know this by using the aforementioned NP then he would know that he would have to effectively use shields clubs and other none bladed weapons talking from a strict No Ea allowed perspective here the easiest way to defeat him would be to make Archer deplete all his mana. How you ask? Simple open the GoB very wide shoothordesupon hordes of NP making sure they are countered making sure that Arher will have to projectrecreate the weapons which leads to an increased mana cost which he wouldnt be able to keep up for very long. Of course Archer wouldnt just simply stand there hed switch to aggressive melee style where Gil should use his defensive stuff to succesfully keep Archer at bay. Without Ea or some other Divine Construct which cant be projected and has amazing power Maybe Merodach? Gil has no chance at overpowering Archer inside UBW despite the fact that hes actaulya competent melee fighter. Just not as good as specialised servants.Do you get now why its headache inducing? Because the entire fights basically comes down to a lot of IFs. If Gil uses his armor if he uses Ea If he uses his Libra hack if Archer even lives long enough to cast UBW if Gil actually uses his brain etc...Get what I mean? Anyways no matter how you put it Archer would certainly have the edge inside UBW but to say demolished is complete nonsense. Both Archer and Shirou would have to fight using their all in order to have a chance at victory. Not really demolishing if you ask me. IMO its pretty much one of the more uncertain fights due to having to rely on so many ifs. Some will say that Archer would win for sure other will say that Gil would pull out Ea in time wear his armor.I just say How the frick should we know? Way too many uncertain factors! Only Nasu knows.Fun fact Gil fights FSN Archer in FateExtra CCC and wins. However its an RPG and the fight is optional so take it with a grain of salt. Another fun fact Shirou on his own isnt strong enough to defeat Gil due to him not having enough mana to do UBW on his own. Not that it actually matters.,fatestaynight,d3dy5gz,6,t5_31xwr

Both reasonings dont have a solid basis but For Avalon which should be able to shut all exterior interference to not being able to protect itself from curses and endangering the place where Gaia soul resides ... Idk.The Arthurian myth talks about the destruction of Caliburn on a duel but i dont recall any specific mention of it in the Nasuverse version. Kay only mentions that Saber was incredibly pale and dishearted when she lost it. Also the references that the blade should no longer exist are vague and non specific. Is there a place where they say that she lost it on a duel?Fgo Saber Lily profile says that Caliburn can reach excalibur power output but only once  it cant withstand the mana and when wielded by a rightful king.The info about Excalibur constraints are in Sabers second interlude in Grand Order.Going to sleep now..

Nothing is black and white. Sacking a village allows all the wheat livestock and resources to be used in other matters and in Arturias case raising and sustaining an army to hold off an approaching country.Save the lives of the many over the lives of the few  that is what every good leader would do.

9579587,0,t3_5boy5y,gtWho is the original Rins servant in archer timeline do we have a way to know it ?To my understanding. We have no clue who Rins servant only fan theories based off the likely evidence.  ampnbspOne such likely theory is Rin summoned Archer himself since you can do stuff like this in the fate universe cause leading to effect is not necessary in the nasuverse since certain things are beyond the effect of time in fact the th magic breaks it down and laughs at cause and effect.  Put simply Rin summoning Archer is a possible thing and is probably what did happen until we have evidence to the contrary.Another fan theory is that Rin summoned Ajax also known as Aias or someone else who had access to Rho Aias since Archer has memories of Rho Aias and is able to project it.  He could visualized Rho Aias anytime during his life but it would be neat and kinda logical if he visualized Rho Aias since he met the original user of Rho Aias which is known as Ajax  Aias.  Just because a theory is neat and makes good book ends does not mean it had to occur in such a way.  Shirou could have seen Rho Aias  during the grail war or  somehow during his journeys of him trying to be a hero of justice prior to making his deal with the world to be a counter guardian or  after the deal prior to his death.    Now lets pretend we know for sure that Shirou obtained Rho Aias during his grail war of his own timeline even though we cant really pretend this with certanity and we are just making assumptions.  Does this mean Ajax was summoned by Rin? The answer is no not necessarily perhaps Ajax was summoned as another servant by another master not Rin for example Ajax could be summoned in the Lancer class by a master such as Bazett or a different master or by a psuedo master such as Caster  Medea.  Even if we know for sure Ajax was summoned we do not know what class he would be summoned as such as Archer Lancer etc.  Perhaps in this proto grail war of Archers timeline as Shirou Gilgamesh was summoned during the previous grail war the th grail war and he used Rho Aias and this is how Shirou witnessed it even though Rho Aias was not used by Shirou of the FSN  timelines.  In other words just because Archer has Rho Aias it does not mean he neccessarly ever met Ajax  Aias the Great.  There was also another Ajax in the trojan war which is known as Ajax the LesserampnbspFrom earlier before I gogtTo my understanding. We have no clue who Rins servant only fan theories based off the likely evidence.  If I am wrong and that later on Nasu in a fan interview or a fan QampA did say X or Z on who Rins servant is during that timeline or how Archer got Rho Aias please tell me and correct the record.  That said it would be great if you could provide a source.This is why I prefaced this entire thing with the comment to my understanding.,fatestaynight,d9tvonj,1,t5_31xwr

10009445,0,t3_5izlt6,I would say that there is one not very wellknown NP that Gilgamesh posses that could be considered strongest even if it literally have no firepower at all. But if Gilgamesh really use it he would be really really strong.That NP is Sha Nagba Imuru The Omniscient Omnipotent StarIt pretty much make Gilgamesh a top rank Clairvoyance user that can see all possibilities or even a even seeing through a piece of the truth of the demise of human history. I think theres a scene from FateExtra CCC that describes something like this in a chess game When facing him in a game like chess he claims that even someone making advanced predictions and reading the flow of the game will have already lost at that moment. He does not read the future of the chess board but instead gazes down upon it and oversees allowing the correct move to always be visible to him. Even in something like a card game the very minimum requirement to play against him on equal terms would be to draw the precise hand required. And To quote Narita the author of FateStrange Fake about seeing all possibilities As Gilgamesh is also a fellow clairvoyance user I asked about the state of Gilgameshs memories when hes summoned. The answer I got was that Gilgamesh can see the possibilities of various parallel worlds if he so chooses but the Throne adjusts the memories and knowledge of the Heroic Spirit according to the world they are summoned in so he wont be confused by having multiple sets of memories. I was told that even if he did use clairvoyance to see the possibility of a world where he was swallowed by the mud of the grail Gilgamesh would reject that world line as being nonsense lol. Moreover it is implied in the latest chapter of FateGrand Order that one of the condition that is required to be able to be qualified as a Grand Caster is to be a clairvoyance user. The currently known users that qualified as Grand Casters are Solomon who see everything past and future Merlin who see everything present and I think it is also implied that Gilgamesh can be summoned into Grand Caster class too because of this Noble Phantasm.Of course considering his ego he would normally reject anything that doesnt suit him or his liking so thats why he can still be defeated lol.,fatestaynight,dbc9cp9,20,t5_31xwr
