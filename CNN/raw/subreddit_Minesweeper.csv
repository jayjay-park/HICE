1037071,0,t1_chm28dz,That winning percentage is insanely high! If you go for speed it would dropI think its a lot faster with a mouse. You can easily go sub if you stop worrying about percentages.PS If you dont wanna ruin it Switch to MinesweeperX for speedruns. It has a more exact timer and is an official version for world and countryrankings.,Minesweeper,chm64q8,3,t5_2r4c3
1503784,0,t1_cj4o8qo,Well its impossible to tell what the safe spaces are. Only one of the spaces next to the four are a mine. The space that is next to the safe  space will be a mine.,Minesweeper,cj4rtuv,7,t5_2r4c3

3666784,0,t3_32dhvc,Looks cool!Maybe make the mine flags a different colour to make them stand out a little bit more? I guess Im just used to them being red P,Minesweeper,cqa8kwo,3,t5_2r4c3

4548181,0,t1_ct3vkd5,Arent we talking about it now? PI suppose I should have said valid n for clarity but n has to be at least  for the game to work with the first click  rule.If n lt  with the vista rule as I stated it the game simply makes no sense because you must force the game or can force the game in the n case to uniformly distribute the one mine in  spaces.,Minesweeper,ct3x8eo,1,t5_2r4c3

4851512,0,t1_cu5zs8u,Good job! Thought you had given up for a moment there. What I did to solve it relatively quickly was just playing through it a few times trying to put the mines in different spots every time. THat way after  playthroughs I could narrow it down to about  squares by comparing all the images.Also safe spots are most often found around s that touch higher numbers. Knowing this along with the hint I put next to the image it could be even quicker to check those few squares first.,Minesweeper,cu62i08,1,t5_2r4c3
4988803,0,t3_3j98h5,Yep.Guessing a block on the right near the numbers is probably not the best. The lowest chance is  ..If you pick a random block on the left there is  or  mines among  blocks. Thats .. Pick the bottomleft topleft or the block  blocks left of the bottommost .Actually I heard whatever block you click at the start goes to the topleft or some complete nonsense bullshit like that so click one of the other two.,Minesweeper,cunc3n5,1,t5_2r4c3
5169482,0,t1_cv91yxs,Practicing this playing  games with the main focus on completing as many as possible wont help you get any faster or become a better Sweeper.  If you want to work on your efficieny efficient play regarding time andor clicks your best bet is to use Minesweeper Arbiter or Minesweeper Clone. Both of these verisons show BV and allow you to replay the same board over and over again.To make your clicking more efficient simply focus on keeping your IOE BVtotal clicks as high as possisble  preferrably above .. For timeefficient playing practice the same board several times.,Minesweeper,cv942ok,1,t5_2r4c3

6930458,0,t3_4anj5z,Short answer No.Long answer The locations of all mines are determinded after the first click is made and can not be changed in any way. That is unless the version you are playing has a mode where they can change locations. I know of only  such versions.  There are  possible explanations  Not all of these scenarios are actually  chances.  You remember more of the instances where you lose.,Minesweeper,d11w59s,3,t5_2r4c3

9359333,0,t1_d92bp94,One thing I can think of assuming its not lagging for you for some reason is that the dragging works by requiring the mouse to be held and then moved by px at which point the mouse down is ignored and you start dragging instead so if you try to click quickly whilst moving the mouse you can end up missing a click and dragging instead since by the time you let the mouse button up to do the click youve moved more than px and it starts dragging insteadEdit I change it to px of movement now instead which might improve things a lot if that was the case,Minesweeper,d92d2wl,2,t5_2r4c3

10055342,0,t1_dbi89i0,On the left side Im not sure why you say all other spaces you try give you worse odds besides E and F. There are better guesses.Also you say there are two possibilities but I would consider those to be three.On the right side what specific tiles would you guess?,Minesweeper,dbi8hmf,1,t5_2r4c3
