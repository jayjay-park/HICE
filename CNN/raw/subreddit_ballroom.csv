208066,0,t3_1vg6ef,The collegiate competitions in my area southern California allow competing in two levels in each style so I competed in both bronze and silver. Silver level has a higher standard for technique. Costumes were not allowed in the syllabus levels so there was no difference in attire between bronze and silver or even between silver and gold. Most girls would just find a longer dress for standardsmooth and a shorter more Latinlooking one for Latin. I got my dresses at Ross Dress for Less. My dance partner did get custommade Latin pants though that I think he also wore for Standard. ,ballroom,cf254f4,1,t5_2r31v

2176509,0,t3_2jxfhy,Other users have already given some stellar advice but one thing that I know took me over a year to get right is the frame. I would have my arms in the correct position and then have no connection with my partner.My suggestion to you is to imagine that there is a connection stemming from the middle of your back right between the shoulder blades resonating towards your partner. Dont push but dont let your elbows collapse either.The best way Ive heard it described is agree to meet in the middle. What that means is that at the beginning of the dance wherever your frame occupies space you keep it there. If he gives pressure you dont collapse your arms back you move your whole body in order to maintain the frame.Frame and connection was by far the most difficult thing for me to learn and like you made the Waltz difficult to learn. I promise though once you understand frame EVERY SINGLE DANCE will be easier. ,ballroom,clghji2,1,t5_2r31v
2285704,0,t3_2lf4wc,I agree with JonB but would add that gift cards to places that sell ballroom shoes would be amazing since its pretty much impossible to pick out shoes without trying them on and attempting to dance on their miniature dance floor installation in the store. And thats just for comfort and size not including style and color and such.Id just like to add that it is very thoughtful of you to want to gift your father something that represents his hobbies and interests. ,ballroom,clu8a50,3,t5_2r31v
5590155,0,t1_cwpzoo0,Ahh events. Yea I just did it because I like to dance and Im not the club type to fuck with clothes on and call it a dance move. But events were different I didnt ever need anyone else rating me and all that. All I needed was a good follower who liked to have fun.,ballroom,cwq0evs,0,t5_2r31v
7416900,0,t3_4gulju,Some oncampus and offcampus accommodation has training rooms sometimes with halls for gymnastics. If you know someone who lives in a place like this that would probably be ideal.Of course many campuses also have sports centres with halls and those are not always occupied or even offer open training hours where students can just come in.Its all about connections.A sort of bigger idea You could start a ballroom club. There are tons of people interested in learning the basics on a campus and not having to go to an official ballroom studio takes a lot of the entry hesitations off young peoples shoulders. Probably not really what you are looking for but hey! You never know.,ballroom,d2l94y5,1,t5_2r31v
7966984,0,t1_d4bhx3m,Originally we wanted to learn to properly dance for ourselves. With the pricing and time requirements now coming to light we may have to settle for a short choreographed routine. We didnt have a certain song in mind but now were gonna need settle on one pretty quickly to make the October wedding date.      We are in eastern Iowa  western Illinois area. If I were in NYC I would totally look you up.,ballroom,d4bkc1a,1,t5_2r31v
