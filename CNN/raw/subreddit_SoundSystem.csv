5058503,0,t1_cuvcfuw,If you are using this on the road any scratch is going to start absorbing water rain spills etc? unless you restain frequently. The advantage of LineX is its extreme durability chemical stability over time and heat tolerance. You should be able to have that cabinet linexed for between  dollars. If you have invested that much time in the project it would be worth considering to protect the materials you used! Sorry but Im a sucker for the black grainy cabinet ,SoundSystem,cuvqo1m,1,t5_2sz02

11550262,0,t1_dg56dgu,If the speakers have impedance ratings within acceptable levels  ohms you can use them with an off the shelf receiver. The sub is probably passive not powered and isnt going to work with this setup. The speakers are not going to die any time soon so if youre looking for something to last until then just replace it all. The wires can likely stay in the walls and wont really matter one way or the other. Cut them off at the speaker and replace the entire system with nongarbage. ,SoundSystem,dg584eq,2,t5_2sz02
