3084352,0,t1_cohh7kq,He gives the best hugs doesnt he?  None of that side hug pat pat bullshit!  I drove from Boulder CO to SLC to see him perform.  I had found his book sort of by accident and I downloaded it and listened to it mainly part  in one night.  At the time I was actively planning how and when I was going to end my life.  His book changed that for me and while I dont drink I knew my one big life changing moment was deciding that suicide was no longer a viable option.  That change came for me on the night of April stearly morning of April nd.  And then I immediately jumped on the podcast bandwagon. The change in me was so profound that I was determined to see him live and hopefully meet him.  He was doing a few random tour dates and the closest listed was SLC.  I have some friends in Salt Lake so I decided to make a weekend of it and go out.I made him some cufflinks with his name in gallifreyan and while they didnt turn out as cool as Id have liked and Im sure they got left in the dressing room it was important to me to take something I had made.  I just had to say thank you.When I got to the venue I overheard the wait staff tell someone else he wasnt doing a signing or meet and greet after the show.  I was bummed but I tried my luck and sent him a tweet.  He sent me a DM back and invited me to the green room after the show.  And he was SO gracious.  Like you I was a little bit of a mess.  I gave him the gift and being Chris he geeked out over it a little bit.  I met Chloe. I somehow managed to tell him You saved my life.  Im sure he hears that a lot but he just gave me a huge hug and told me he was glad I was there.  He signed my book and my character tome he took a couple selfies of us with my phone we chatted for a few minutes and then after another hug I took my leave.  He had another show and Im sure the last thing he wanted to do was talk to a fan.  But it was a really important night for me.  Of course shortly after that he announced that he was coming to Denver in Sept to play Red Rocks with the Oddball Comedy Tour.  Of course I went th row!  And then he came back to Denver in January and I took  coworkers and introduced them to his standup. One laughed so hard he was crying. I came all the way from Boulder isnt nearly as impressive when hes playing in Denver about half an hour away so I didnt try to meet him again but I wore my Nerdist hoodie and geeked out the whole time.  Hes a really nice guy.  I think he must still remember how anxiety and depression made him feel because Ive only heard of and experienced him being gracious and genuine and kind when someone shares their story with him.  Maybe this will sound presumptuous but he almost seemed... humbled? when I tried to explain how he saved my life.  I mean that is kind of an odd thing to respond to I guess. Geez.  Im sitting here reliving that night and Im in tears.  Chris if youre reading this I hope you know how grateful we all are for you. You went from being the Singled Out guy to being someone who makes hard things better for a lot of people.  Thats pretty amazing. Thank you.,nerdist,cohowrn,2,t5_2sw9a
3106498,0,t1_coju00o,I should also note that I hosted an online radio show for several years  or so putting together  hours of music every week and I would talk inbetween the sets about the songs Id played... It streamed on live.com and I just used a headset mic which had noisecancelling.  When my wife and I started dating in  she started cohosting with me and we basically got her a second headset and used a Y cable to plug both of them into the computer using the microphone jack.  The quality of the audio probably wasnt as good as whats available now but it wasnt bad either.  Im wondering if something similar could be done for podcasting.

Our stagnant periods are places we can settle and learn our limits to satisfaction and disatisfaction the secrets to our happiness and inherent traits.You have to accept these low points in your life. Without these low points in your life youll never know how amazing the peaks really are. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.

7459127,0,t3_4g3sf6,Id love to hear James Marsters on the podcast. Ive loved the episodes with other people from Buffy in the past and Spike was a favorite character for many. In addition to Buffy Chris could talk to him about his roles on other shows like Smallville and Torchwood as well as his musical career his art and his love of science listen his interview on The Skeptics Guide to the Universe ,nerdist,d2q211c,1,t5_2sw9a

7781229,0,t1_d3ok2wa,Yeah thats something that stands out to me. I always go to the nerdist official site for comments on a podcast release to see discussions on it but am always surprised at how few comments there are. Ive googled around for nerdist podcast discussion more than a few times. I feel like Im missing some central place where people talk about it.,nerdist,d3qnt7a,2,t5_2sw9a

If you want to judge it give it a fair trial and go see it.Its not a movie thats ruining your lives and making you unhappy. Figure out what is and address that.,nerdist,d4vld4l,5,t5_2sw9a

8700651,0,t3_4z5k92,Hi! My name is Dennis Restauro and I want to thank Chris and the rest of the Nerdist crew for inspiring us all to go out and make a thing. Following that advice I made a thing called Grounded Reason  groundedreason.com which is a website focused on cutting the cord on traditional pay TV and taking a more active approach to consuming media. We recently launched a podcast called Grounded Reason Podcast where we will be expanding the theme to more Tech for the Everyman or rather Every Person.  Its available on iTunes Stitcher your grocers freezer or anywhere podcasts are given away freely. You can also check it out at ,nerdist,d6t7p6l,5,t5_2sw9a
