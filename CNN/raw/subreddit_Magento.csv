453329,0,t1_cfrpwff,What are some of the inputs that you take to arrive on a decision if an email should not be sent to a particular abandoned cartcustomer? Perhaps we could come up with something to automate this decision making because it might not be very feasibly to do approvals with hundreds of abandoned carts per day. I will still consider this feature when I work on this next.You can define campaigns which are coupled with subcampaigns. Each Campaign corresponds to a step of the checkout. So say you only want to trigger emails with promotion codes to customers who abandoned their cart after payment information is entered you can do that. Or similarly if you only want to target customers who have come through till the step that lets them choose between guestlogged in checkout You can do that too. Similarly it would also let you send different discount amounts for emails corresponding to different steps of the checkoutcampaigns.The module is safe to install. It does not rewrite any core Magento functionality so it wont interfere with anything else. Thank you for your interest!,Magento,cfrsj9z,1,t5_2qx9e

1095334,0,t1_chsnhx9,My feeling is that Magento go is a dead product wasnt even mentioned during Magento Imagine. I wouldnt recommend merchants to Go pun intended? that route. Im sure other SaaS solutions provide better functionality. From my understanding migrating from Go to CE or EE isnt a walk in the park either at least youd think the transition would be relatively straight forward.,Magento,chsskxe,3,t5_2qx9e
1095466,0,t1_chsskxe,It isnt.  I had to transition someone myself.I also contacted GO the other day and asked them about that.  Because I had a client who was looking into all options.  They said that right now theyre not really putting a lot of focus on it but nobody has seemed to indicate that it is going anywhere.  Theyre just not pushing it bigtime because it doesnt meet everyones needs.The differences between Magento GO and CE are basically this Magento GO is a modified CE version that has a few EE versions in exchange for absolute lack of customization other than through CSS.  Id say about  of shops wouldnt work well with GO.But if you dont care if youre using what amounts to a mass produced template it isnt going to be an issue.  Its only really an issue if you want someone to design a theme from the ground up and create custom extensions unless youre a certified to do so you cannot sell extensions or heck  any extensions.  Last time I was looking the GO offerings for extensions were abysmal.So they basically have a product that is subpar to a free version.  But that doesnt mean it is useless.  Like I said  since it is managed by Magento it is less likely to fail.  But if youre getting thousands of unique visitors a day your site is still going to run slow because they are not using a dedicated server per install.But for someone who is looking for something beyond shopify albeit only slightly GO will perform and the lack of any transactioncredit card processing is nice.  But then again last I was on the backend GO didnt have a mobile template to go to it required a lot of somewhat hackish things in order to do it.The major thing is that I dont think theyre advertising it because theyre afraid that it wont meet the needs of most businesses.  It is targeted to the same sized businesses as would be served by Shopify but with a slightly different service.  I personally like GO better than Shopify and would say GO is better.  But that is just my opinion.Oh and one last thing  to address the conversion it is a pain as I stated at first.  But the difference is that you just have to know what to do.  You cant drag and drop the template it has to be built from the ground up again though theoretically you could get a similar template and just have the css file override everything but that would be silly.  But you can once you figure out what is what export the catalog and modify the csv to be imported into CE.  The only things you would need at that point are copies of the product images creation of the categories no easy way to do that from GO and then the attributes.  Which is honestly a lot more of a PITA than it could be.But anyway Im rambling out loud.Like I said the main thing I think preventing them from talking about it more is that it is really only part of what it could be.  If it had a clearer upgrade path even if it was GO to EE and skip CE there would be reason to start at GO.  And if there were more extensions andor ability to customize theyd have a little room to wiggle.  But they dont so theyre better off trying to get the product up to shape and then relaunching it so that it can do better.Actually I think I just talked myself out of recommending GO to most clients.  Still if youre coming from shopify and you want to use magento GO isnt a bad change.  And it saves on hosting and management while offering some of the features of Magento that are lacking in Shopify.,Magento,chst4eh,0,t5_2qx9e

Also is managing the fraud process something you want to handle inhouse or find someone to take the liability and decisioning off your hands.

2530720,0,t3_2onhlc,Technically the answer is yes and as a best practice you will want to add the products to your default category for any given store. If for instance you forget to add a product to a subcategory and delete the subcategory you will also delete the product.There are a number of other things that can happen I wont go through all of them.Its really simple to add all of your products to the default category.Go to your catalog gt manage categoriesSelect your category Choose category products tabyou will see a multiselect that says yes within the grid select anyIn views per page select Hit the checkbox to select allHit save.All of the products even if there are more than  will be added to the category. ,Magento,cmowgri,1,t5_2qx9e

You dont want to go that way.As i understand you would like to work with a RDBMS. Have you thought about NoSQL?You could store your objects as you like and the DB would not care about its structure.
