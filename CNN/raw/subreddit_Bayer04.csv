1782301,0,t3_2eu7i1,Very balanced. This is going to be a challenge for the team but I believe that they finish as group winners. And Berbatov is coming back to the BayArena.,Bayer04,ck3ta7q,1,t5_2x6ef
3262845,0,t1_cp06op8,gt Playing at home and then losing in extra time. No more of that crap is needed.SCF attempted a really dangerous shot on goal in the last couple of minutes this match. The lead by one goal wasnt that comforting. gt But aside from that I dont know how Schmidt will approach this match.I guess Bender and Castro in the CDM positions. Schmidt didnt even put Castro on the Bench today so he probably wanted to give him some rest. On the prematch press conference for the Freiburg match Schmidt said that Jedvaj will be back for the Stuttgart match at the earliest. He is still in individual training. Hilbert has shown a pretty consistent performance in recent matches I hope he can continue with this. Our defense looks pretty solid and Leno is back in the game! Really nice development but the rollercoaster cart is still on its rails.gtAside from that good work on improving the look and function of the subreddit.Thanks a lot! ,Bayer04,cp07enx,1,t5_2x6ef

5769876,0,t3_3u4va9,Really bummed about the result. I dont know what to say about Lenos error. Hes had a very peculiar campaign. Still back him though.BATE played a good game today and their pressing seemed to unsettle the entire attack. Perfect physical gameplan in the freezing weather  Im sure that had an effect also. Funny thing and I may be alone here but I think Kiessling could have really helped up top today. A battering ram probably could have took that bus apart.Fingers crossed for a tiewin next game and a some luck.Edit Am I right in saying a win and Roma losstie is the only way to advance? A tie would put  at pts and a Roma tie puts them at pts also. A BATE win put them at . Todays loss is worse than I thought.,Bayer04,cxcb1u1,6,t5_2x6ef

6673653,0,t1_d09f3xe,I know it seems this way but you cant ignore that some of the other potential CL teams have also dropped a good amount of points. Especially on dates when Bayer fail to pick someany up.Im not entirely disagreeing with you though. Just when it seems like the team is about to get back to full fitness and hitting stride... BOOM. Two of the most consistent performers and leaders on the pitch gone. I cant remember many recent games where one of them werent MOTM for most of us here.Hoping the team can adjust and keep the ship steady. They were able to do it without Bender and this is asking for even more.,Bayer04,d09m3gp,3,t5_2x6ef
6712898,0,t1_d0dnhvp,Yeah when it was  it actually could have gone either way.Hey a big thank you for this great idea! I sure had fun discussing with you and the other Sporting fans hopefully youll win the league Im definitely going to watch a few Sporting games in the future. It really was a fun experience getting to know you guys! By the way I visited Lisbon a few years ago and I have to say you truly live in a great city.I hope youre not too mad when I steal your idea and try to set up a cooperation with the next teams subreddit that were going to face ,Bayer04,d0do6bk,7,t5_2x6ef

11069411,0,t3_5y0ihn,Say what you will about Schmidt personally I think his sacking was the correct decision but his policy of aggressively blooding youth players will only benefit the club.    Whether through injuries or poor performance the veterans and signings that the likes of Henrichs and Havertz replaced sent a clear message to the kids if you work hard and train hard you will be rewarded. It gave them the mentality that success isnt a foregone conclusion based on your wages transfer fee or experience.   The kids while immensely talented were given the right mindset to go and play well above their years and that is all thanks to Schmidt. Hopefully his legacy can move the club forward through these young players well after he has left.,Bayer04,demph5j,12,t5_2x6ef

11793750,0,t3_689qpu,Kitimat BC Canada! A town a few hundred kilometres south of the Alaskan panhandle. Industrial town that was populated heavily by post war German immigrants and Azorian Portuguese. Naturally I was a fan of the German National Team and after  I became a huge Michael Ballack fan. Although I didnt know he would soon be transferred I bought a jersey and the rest is history. I wish I could say I was fan during the Champions League final run but trust me it still hurts me as if I was. ,Bayer04,dgwv0pz,3,t5_2x6ef
