3989694,0,t3_365wnl,I completely agree it is not up to us as masons to advise others on matters of faith or what to believe. And I also agree this is a dilemma only you can resolve. But I personally take issue with a faith or religion dictating what a person can affiliate with unless there is an empirically based reason beyond what the doctrine specifies. And yes Im aware that is religion in a nutshell and do not take issue with dont kill steal covet etc but threatening excommunication for joining a fraternity designed to help you improve yourself and help your community just doesnt make sense to me. Yes I understand there is a lot of ignorance and misunderstanding regarding freemasonry but how many members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon are catholic? I do not know the answer to that but I do not know of any threats of excommunication resulting from that or any other college fraternity whose members have publicly shown a degree of moral turpitude. Point being its a completely discriminatory stance and thats contrary to the messages of acceptance Id think Id want from my religion of choice. ,freemason,crb25s7,1,t5_2r7hf
