6703508,0,t3_46sdg8,To save the West it must begin in the West. Specifically with the next generation. Currently many children are being taught common core which is a complete waste of effort and time. They are being taught that feelings are more important than facts and that the process you use is more important than the correct answer. We taught that hurting others feelings is not only immoral but should be illegal. We are told that pride in ones heritage is akin to racism and national pride and patriotism are equivalent with radical facist nationalism. Children are taught that they should not be judged by the content of their character but rather how much melanin is in their skin and what dangles between their legs. This ideology of collectivist thought is what is ultimately destroying the West. The West has faced down the outside threats that we see today before. The west has successfully stared down militaristic Islamists aggressive moves from Russia and tensions in Asia. There is nothing on the outside that the West can not handle.  The West must begin its repair at home. We must reinvigorate our family and community values. We must rebuild broken communities and encourage public service. Children should be taught less about how they should feel and more about the histories of their nations the science that dictates our universe and the language that it speaks in math. We must raise our children to be critical thinkers with the empathy and compassion to understand and appreciate the rights of others. Gender studies programs and other fru fru degrees should not be given the funding or the accreditation that they now receive. A lot must change in order to bring back the best of the West but it can be and should be done.,CatholicPolitics,d0cp8h7,1,t5_3cfrp

Period  they have a view which doesnt square with morality. Not Catholic teaching nor natural law nor Biblical law. Yes they will forever try to insist that they are not in fact wrong or will sink their teeth and claws into any possible perception of failing on their oppositions side in order to at least fight to a draw. But really theyre wrong.And theyre wrong here too.gtAnd actually it is quite easy for many Catholics like myself to square it with subsidiarity and I am sure you also are conveniently ignoring the complementary doctrine of solidarity. The world is globalized and the community is more interconnected. Its not easy at all. In fact its every bit as hard to square it as it is to square the compatibility of abortion support with Church teaching or flat out atheism with being a bishop. The only thing thats easy is saying its easy. Or just saying Alakazam Good Samaritan. Sure the samaritan wasnt from a far away land and the samaritan wasnt invited  with his  tribe members  to resettle in and ultimately displace anyone. But hey its easy.Also hey the bishops an atheist who supports abortion and gay marriage but...! His hearts in the right place. For instance he supports gun control. Doesnt that make him more like Christ than most of us? Etc.Edit Ill add there is this habit liberals have of taking personal acts of direct charity in the Bible and turning them into enforcedbylawgunsandjail absolute mandates. The Parable of the Good Samaritan illustrates how a person who is kind is a neighbor. Ergo your city must now house tens of thousands of immigrants sight unseen. They dont speak your language. They dont share your values or even your religion. Many of them are bringing a lot of problems with them. This will disrupt and split your community.

This isnt just about abortion though if Hillary gets elected you can kiss your wishes of getting that overturned for another decade or so goodbye as well. But this is about fundamentally changing the voting demographics in this country and the culture at large.Hillary is going to let in large swaths of people from the third world. She said herself she is proOpen Borders. I understand that many Mexicans whom this will benefit are faithful Catholics. But as a voting bloc they typically vote democrat. So the more of them they are the less likely a conservative candidate has any kind of chance being elected in the next four to eight  years.But it goes even further than that. Because Hillary has no problem letting in Muslim immigrants. A good portion of these are people who fundamentally disagree with our way of life and will not integrate. They come here for the welfare benefits to support their polygamous marriages and children but refuse to take on our values. In a generation their children become spiteful and some even dangerous. Look at Europe. Look I understand it is very difficult to vote for someone like Trump if you find his rhetoric andor actions asinine at times which they can be.

No liberal Court is going to be amicable in helping the prolife movement.gtDidnt Hobby Lobby win its contraceptives ruling?Yes. And every liberal justice ruled against them.gtWhile the forced participation in gay weddings issue is problematic I dont see how businesses can refuse to serve gay couples without violating state law that prohibits discrimination against individuals. The lower courts have seemed to agree with this view and Id imagine they would continue to agree with this view if the shop owners were gay and the customers were Christian. Asserting that this is new discrimination against Christians masks the deeper reality which is that gay people have never come out until recently. Now that theyre out theyll apply the nondiscrimination laws that are available to them as individuals. That doesnt mean the Christian owners are being persecuted for the sake of their Christianity you havent said this but that perception seems to be shared by many Christians.Ive no interest in discussing the law as concerns this.

9535681,0,t1_d9o7qva,gtSorry there are quite clearly many Democrats who promote and celebrate abortion in the name of equalityfreedom and merely use the phrase constitutional right as cover.Right. I wasnt trying to deny that people celebrate their right to an abortion. The point was that no woman actively gets pregnant in order to get an abortion. At best getting an abortion is an unpleasant inconvenience for the women even if she attaches absolutely no emotional feelings to the act of killing her own child. The other point was that Roes intention was simply to prevent government interference with abortion. The government is not actually forcing women to abort their children.gtI cant believe any faithful Catholic would accept this line of reasoning. Murder rape etc. also continue to occur despite legal sanctions. Should these acts also be considered extralegal depending on the situation?Extralegal changes in our society can also lower the murder and rape rate. There isnt sufficient evidence to support the idea that capital punishment i.e. punitive punishment from the government is enough to deter crimes like murder. Sure maybe making abortion illegal not going to happen even under Trump or punishing women who get abortions would lower the abortion rate. My point was that voting Democrat and voting against the legal criminalization of abortion does not mean the abortion rate still wont drop. Historically the rate has dropped under both of our most recent Democratic presidents despite the fact that feminists are shouting their abortions louder and louder these days.gtRegarding Democrats and their base the leaked DNC emails have revealed that their support is largely taken for granted. Studies have shown that Democratic presidents have a strong tendency to help black families and other American families as well. So whether Clinton is pandering or not black people are voting in their best interest.As Ive said elsewhere on this thread the Spirit Cooking issue is being spun completely out of proportion. We have no evidence that Podesta answered the dinner invitation. The wacko artist says shes never met him and that he didnt come to dinner.
