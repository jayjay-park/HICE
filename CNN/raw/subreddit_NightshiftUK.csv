2187041,0,t3_2k404d,I subscribed here because itll be nice to have UK people potentially around in the night but I dont technically work a night shift.  Username relevant.Today is a good example I had to wake up early for a teleconference then I had an hour until my next virtual meeting so I went for a quick nap and accidentally slept through the rest of the day.  Shit.  Had to come up with some bullshit about having internet problems.  And now Ill need to catch up on some of the things I should have done today tonight.,NightshiftUK,clhtqp9,2,t5_345e4
