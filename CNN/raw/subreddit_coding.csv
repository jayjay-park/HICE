Im not sold on Thrift.gt Can you give some examples?Cucumber is a python example.For REST its implicit in the routes that is the concept of code generation becomes nonrequired.gt Thrift doesnt add another server dependencyOh?  Maybe Im misunderstanding.  I see now.  Looks like you just have to use a thrift server library in your language of choice.  Ok not so bad.  Can you speak to its popularity?  If its so awesome why is it not taking off so much?  This is frankly the first Ive ever heard of it...and Im willing to look deeper.Also does Thrift give any of the benefits of tying your RPC into task queuing?  Do you get clustering or failure handling?gt That said even that setup doesnt seem to have the benefit of Thrifts ability to define an RPC interface and subsequently generate code for itIm really not seeing your point here... Looking at this example I can only see that I could write a similar process using AMQP in a lot fewer lines.Can you give me any examples of active communities for thrift?  Is this going somewhere?  Lets say I have a complete running RPC solution using AMQP running crosslanguage and crossprotocol with the support of gateway processes... do I have any incentive to add Thrift into my mix?,coding,cfimq50,1,t5_2rb2y

4721885,0,t1_ctpq3ey,gtI think that stdsizet being unsigned is an unfortunate situation that we just have to live with.Its funny watching people say things like this as though signed integers are somehow selfevidently better.  Why would you want to use a signed integer to represent a size?  Would you use strings to represent a boolean value?  A string can represent true and false perfectly acceptably so whats the problem?Well a string can also represent foo and bar what do those mean in the context of booleans?The same argument applies to signed vs. unsigned integers.  When you use an unsigned type you instantly inform anyone consuming or reading your code that negative values dont make any sense in this situation just as when you use a boolean rather than a string you instantly inform anyone consuming or reading your code that foo and bar arent valid its true or false and nothing else.gtAnyways if you have to worry about the trivially signed version of stdsizet overflowing in your program I would argue that you are in a probably embedded niche.This is so backwards that Im having difficulty fathoming how you can take yourself seriously typing this.Using stdsizet and stdptrdifft are of approximately equal difficulty so theres no argument about stdsizet being more difficult.  stdsizet comes with all sorts of nice guarantees.  Not only does stdptrdifft not come with these guarantees but its also I would argue a fundamentally worthless type If you have a  bit stdptrdifft and you allocate a .GB region of memory and do endbegin the result is perfectly representable as a stdsizet but whats the actual result of that operation?No one knows its undefined because that value doesnt fit into a stdptrdifft.  The name of the type itself is misleading its not stdptrdifft its stdptrdiffsthataresufficientlysmallt.You dont make deliberately poor design decisions using a signed integer for a size because of the perceived unlikelihood of those decisions becoming problematic especially when the cost of making the correct decision is almost zero as it is in this case.Moreover you should be designing your code as reusable components not as a tightlycoupled mess sprinkled with unnecessary assumptions about how other parts of the system works.  If you design a function that takes the size of something you dont hand wave away sizes that are too big because they dont matter because you happen to know the call site of your function and all sorts of domain specific knowledge about whats going on at that call site.  What happens when someone else opens your code and is like sweet gnzlbgbufferfunc does what I want no need to write something myself and tries calling it with a .GB buffer on a  bit system?  Its not their fault for observing DRY its your fault for writing shitty code.Lastly I doubt that you were talking about stdptrdifft specifically.  When people get into this signed vs. unsigned debate its not usually stdsizet vs. stdptrdifft its usually stdsizet vs. int in which case the signed side of the argument is just so flimsy that it borders on ridiculous.You want to write portable code thatll continue to function correctly as the size of main memory inflates use stdsizet.  You want to write flimsy code filled with platformspecific assumptions and prayers that you dont need to deal with anything bigger than GB use int.gtI am lucky to target exclusively bit machines with bit address spacesIf you happen to know that much about the target of your software then this entire debate probably doesnt apply to you.  A lot of the stuff the standard leaves undefined or implementation defined you probably have reliable welldefined syntax for.

4984409,0,t1_cumbp28,gt If at all the fix is not to introduce OptionalltTgt but to introduce AlwaysltTgt as a default. If I am interpreting you correctly thats what designing a language with an OptionalltTgt type means. It means that normally if you have a value of that type you have a value of that type you only have to check for the Null or None case if you have an OptionalltTgt. The type T will always be a T not a T or null.gt Letting everything be an OptionalltTgt does not fix shit either.Yes thats why you have the distinction between T and OptionalltTgt. T will always be a valid while OptionalltTgt is what you use when you do need to distinguish between some value and no value.Of course this isnt as helpful in languages where its tacked on as an afterthought as generally their reference types are already nullable and its cumbersome to have to use some wrapper type for a nonnullable type and update all of the libraries to work with that. But in new languages and libraries that are build with it in mind like Rust its very liberating to not have to worry about null values except in those cases where you really need them.,coding,cumt0sw,2,t5_2rb2y

So in the end he actually only showed the glue code that connects input algorithm and output with some error handling in the mix. How one would write the actual algorithm the sort byte array part is unknown.    Technically he answered the challenge if you assume the sort byte array to be a language or standard library primitive. If I understood it correctly the idea is really interesting but I wonder how they would cope with some problems like optimization of the generated program and multiple platforms.   To me it seems youre still doing the same thing conceptually you have a description of what the program has to do in a very high level language a program to convert that description to machine code also known as compiler and put together the lower level parts your description needs linker?.

This is also said by the proponents for writing cover letters. I think a decent part of the discussion is centered around that very fact though because its so arduous is it worth it  relevant to spit out one of the algorithms that reside in the limited question pool as you put it? Like I said in an earlier comment I believe that is valid criticism.Also I dont think it negatively reflects upon you that you arent working at a toptier company. Online communities hype the Big  up way too much in my opinion. Yes it probably is a very unique and sometimes gratifying experience to work there but there are a ton more companies that are just as challenging to work at  pushing the boundaries of technology just as well.

8058531,0,t3_4pky0l,Im going to try my best to point you in the right direction bud. Python is widely considered the easiest language to learn Im sure many people will have many opinions but this is the general consensus.  If you are running windows which I assume you are youll need to download Python for Windows since it is a scripting language your code has to actually be interpreted by the interpreter so you need the interpreter to run code for it.  On the downloads page download Windows x MSI installer and just run it.  It will set everything up for you. For you I would recommend an Integrated Development Environment  You dont need to know what it actually is or why its important just know it will make it easier for you as a beginner.  I cant recommend one specifically so someone else might be able to help you there. If you dont want to use an IDE then you can use any text editor notepad wordpad etc. to create your code and run it using command prompt.  If you do that I would recommend Notepad  Doing it this way is really not easy since you need to use the full file path for the interpreter wherever it installed to.  The msi should tell you. and the script your code so it should look like     CProgram FileswherevertheinterpreterisPython.exe Cusersyournameyourscript.pySo I would recommend using an IDE so you dont have to worry about doing that.  The IDE will do it for you.  Now remember Python is an interpreted language so you will need to run it in cmd command prompt or in the IDE every time you want to see the output. It wont create an application as you understand it.  If you want one of those youd have to write code in a compiled language. The hardest language to master is C which is a compiled language.  Compiled languages are translated from your code to an executable file what you understand as an application.  C is pretty easy to get into but it gets exponentially more difficult the more you learn about it.  It is a very dangerous language to use without knowledge of how it works.  But if you can get good at it its a great language.  You can use Visual Studio Community  as your IDE for C or C.  C would be a much better option since it holds your hand more.  It is a very powerful language that is pretty easy to learn the basics of and can be written and compiled in VSC.  So your options for making an application are C and C using Visual Studio.  There are other options like Java Swift and ObjectiveC but I dont really like the other options so I wont recommend them to you.  Also in a less biased explanation Java would require  downloading the Java Virtual Machine JVM  dealing with the JVM and how ridiculously slow it is and  learning how to turn your code into an application.  Its quite easy to get good at but it is a pretty lookeddownupon language for the above reasons and a few more Im sure other people who write tons of it can list.  Swift and Objective C also only run well on Mac and iOS so not windows.  Python runs better on Linux and Mac but it can still be programmed in on Windows.  I hope this helped.  If someone else wants to critique my advise feel free.  Im still in school for comp sci so I very well might have gotten some details wrong.,coding,d4luskg,2,t5_2rb2y

9771963,0,t3_5ezvv9,I watched this video last Thursday. When she started talking about multiple cores and scaling there I immediately thought of Amdahls law and that was surprisingly enough the next slide What surprised me though was that she said that tooling needs to improve to better take advantage of multiple cores  parallelism. But Amdahls law gives a limit assuming p the part which can be parallelized is constant. So you quickly end up with diminishing returns even with heavily improved tooling to take advantage of multiple cores. Very few problems can be categorized in the embarrassingly parallel box. Most programs we write arent serial because developers are bad at their job or because the tools are bad huge parts of most applications are serial in nature.So if smarter compilers can take better advantage of multiple cores thats nice I guess. But in practice that ceiling isnt that high and would certainly not be close to give us a growth in performance to the scale Moores law has.If I got to pick I would rather improve tools such as profilers which not just finds hotspots but accurately tells you where you have the most cache misses and branches where the branch predictor consistently guesses wrong. With the incredibly deep execution pipelines nowadays the penalties for an L cache miss or bad branch predictor guess is huge and the most common bottleneck. All of this exists of course but the UX side of things could really be improved so using it becomes second nature.,coding,dahlzzq,2,t5_2rb2y
