The most essential change that needs to be made is the way we motivate people currently we use fear in an attempt to force people into acting a certain way. Its much betterhealthiermore productive if we just inspire and bring out whats already in us. We need supportive forces from below rather than domineering forces from above because when our needs are met we will not have a need to harm others or do things for selfish reasons. ,revolution,cqs960o,3,t5_2qhml
