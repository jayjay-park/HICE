Serves as a necessary break from all of the chaos rather than filler.Absolution Endlessly A very smooth love song that seems like filler in the midst of all of its neighboring songs but it actually matches all of the songs on an emotional level. Great electronics tooBlack Holes amp Revelations Soldiers Poem beautiful backing vocalsThe Resistance Guiding Light In my opinion its great live but even on record its not as bad as some make it out to be.The nd Law Explorers Pretty much every song on this album is very underrated Big Freeze Unsustainable Follow Me Liquid State Animals Survival Panic Station but this song probably gets the least attention which is a shame because the bridge in this song sweeps me off my feet.,Muse,cg5xjew,3,t5_2qz0k

1128011,0,t1_chwi09f,gtThen again maybe Im just making too big a deal of it...Probably. This is a band that has lyrically referenced alien invasions Zetas filling the skys in ExoPolitics worn a handmade Terror Storm shirt on stage Reading and Leeds festivals  and have an entire live album and stadium tour where the theme is a conspiracy theory None of it is new.Ive always felt that most of this comes from Matt and that most of it is less I believe this explicitly and more along the lines of these things are worth reading about then form your own opinion. The idea being that its worth considering alternative viewpoints on commonly accepted things if for no other reason than to know that theyre there and maybe to motivate yourself to prove them wrong. Question everything and all that. I dont have any reason to believe that for example  was an inside job but it was interesting to watch the conspiracy videos that said otherwise... and then dig into it deeper and blow holes in it pointbypoint. It can make you aware of strategies that people  conspiracy theorists sure but mainstream media too  use to project the message that they want regardless of whether or not it is necessarily the black and white truth. It makes you more able to sort through the bullshit and get to whats actually going on.

I think its great that they have been experimenting but nd Law just felt so aimless so many different kinds of sounds that sometimes hit the mark and sometimes missed it a little.

1484284,0,t3_2b5ien,I always felt like maybe Matt wrote the song and recorded it then later decided he didnt like it and felt it was too poppy or too much like U. Its probably because its in a high range and involves a lot of belting which would strain his voice in the context of a whole show. I had mixed feelings about it for a while but now I like it a lot. I think it would benefit from an acoustic or quieter performance with more falsetto or an entirely different key so its in a more manageable range.,Muse,cj2bwjy,6,t5_2qz0k

Then you have guys like Sigur Ros and Radiohead. They are amazing live and although the main focus is always the music it seems to be more of an introverted and atmospheric focus rather than the extroverted blown out amazing pomposity that a Muse show is. Both are entirely valid and just different aproaches that stem from different musical roots.Basicly I think it depends on what youre looking for in a live performance of a band really so youll always get a bit of a flawed answer.,Muse,cno3kj8,4,t5_2qz0k

Before my go to Muse song to put a smile on my face was Panic Station but Psycho blows it out of the water.  Where Panic Station would merely leave me smiling Psycho leaves me flat out laughing.  Above this hilariously bad nature of the lyrics this has probably my favourite guitar riff of theirs.  Its Psycho is like a stupid cheesy action movie compared to their normal work but as a result it is much more enjoyable.

They said a lot of stuff about how excited they were about that album there was a long video of an interview where they reviewed the album song by song and they seemed all pretty confident about the album they were releasing.Drones could very well be his favorite Muse album ever but I think that doesnt change anything.

4001163,0,t1_crc07de,I feel like Muse are simultaneously promoting their album with more radio friendly singles like Mercy and Dead Inside while also leaving enough heavier and less conventional songs as non singles. That makes sense given theyve been seeking greater commercial success in the US for a while now and are willing to promote songs that may be simpler lighter and easier on the ear for new listeners so I think we can be very sure the first two singles are not representative of the album overall. Itll suck a bit for people who might want to see a music video for the heavier songs or who may not like Muse to be circulated as a band that features too many radio friendly hits but whatevs. ,Muse,crcd42r,1,t5_2qz0k

4240346,0,t1_cs3k8dt,The problem for me and seemingly for a lot of people here is that a lot of reviews positive and negative arent talking enough about the music. This one and Pitchfork seem to be the worst offenders because they speak so much about the politics of the band or use such tedious analogies in describing the music that I have no clue what they mean.    I know not everyone would appreciate reading about what time signature a song is in or that theres a section that is all tremolo picking over a triplet drum beat but at least tell us something straightforward about the sound and a little bit about how it affects you. Hell Id listened to the album several times over and then read the Pitchfork review and still had no idea what the fuck they were talking about.

4335966,0,t3_3ajhym,Falling Down Escape and Overdue werent brought into the next tour probably because there were a lot of new songs they were happy to work with and every other song on Showbiz was kept so a few had to be cut. Darkshines and Megalomania didnt make it out of the tour because neither were played that often to begin with. Endlessly TSP and TOADA werent played after the tour for reasons I dont understand perhaps the band didnt feel they worked well with the new songs. Invincible ExoPolitics City of Delusion Assassin and Hoodoo were dropped probably because of Matts change in beliefs largely what the songs are based off of.I Belong to You MK Ultra and the Exogenesis songs are probably very difficult to play live more than likely why we havent heard of them since. Since the band havent touched any of TL except Madness and Animals its probably because the songs dont really work in rotation with this albums theme probably why we havent seen Undisclosed Desires or others like that yet.,Muse,csee5nu,2,t5_2qz0k

4894575,0,t3_3hwsxf,. Dead Inside. I constantly jump this track. I think is the worst opener in a Muse album. I have always loved epic openers such as Take a Bow Sunburn or New Born. Dont get me wrong this song is the last one in a line of antiMuse songs that I actually like the others being Undisclosed Desires and Madness but I think it doesnt work as an opener at all. Even though the lyrics are kind of cheesy I like them.  . Drill Sergeant  Psycho. For me this two tracks are really the same song. I do love the  riff and I think the lyrics suit the purpuse. It is an enjoyable song but in my opinion it is too long there are moments when I can get bored of the same riff repeating over and over again. The Drill Sergeant intro works nicely to me.  . Mercy. It IS Starlight .. That is not a bad thing. I like the song overall but the mastering doesnt do any good to it the guitars are too loud.  . Reapers. I love this track. I love the verses I love the chorus I love the ACDCey riffs I love the solo. I just wish the bass was a bit louder. At last the good old Wolstenholme is back. I love the outro it kinds of reminds me of Space Dementias one.  . The Handler. I agree with Dom and Chris on this one. It is the best song on the album and it is in my top  without a doubt. Its slow dark pace and the lyrics reaally make it for me. Ive read complaints about the bridge but in my opinion it is as long as it must be in order to create buildup to the peak of the song and album. And the last falsetto is just great.  . JFK  Defector. I also see this two tracks as one song. I do really love the JFK intro the guitar and the strings work beautifully against the spoken word. As for Defector I simply cannot get it. I have never been fond of the Queenlike harmonies Matts been obsessed with in the last albums and the riffs are just plain boring and repetitive. On the bright side I really like the solo and the melody is catchy but it still a mehhh song for me.  . Revolt. One of the few weak points of Muse is how they manage to introduce filler songs in all their albums. But this one is particularly ugly. It doesnt work even as a pop song as Mercy or Dead Inside. It is catchy but it is like it had been composed and recorded by a mediocre band not Muse.  . Aftermath. I have always thought that Muses ballads are some of their highest points on their career Hoodoo Blackout Unintended Ruled By Secrecy but this one falls short. I see it like an unfinished song I have the feeling that it could have been something really great but it is only good. Maybe it is that the string section doesnt seem to work. Lyrics arent so bad and the bass line is a high point.  . The Globalist. Once again a song with great potential that feels kind of unfinished. I am not a huge fan of the out of tune whistling and I find the lyrics almost laughable. The middle section is too short for my taste it couldve gone on for another minute or so in order to build a real climax. Where I really think the song misses it is in the third section. I think a pianodriven breakdown in the tone with Exogenesis  Space Dementia or even Butterflies amp Hurricanes couldve been great. Matts the only one in mainstream rock who can do it! Then ending the song in a more minimalistic way such as in Ruled by Secrecy or Isolated System. I do like the song as it is but is really disappointing that Muse let go the opportunity of truly crafting something massive.  . Drones. This is the outro to The Globalist to me but it is not a part of the song. Once again the idea is pretty good but I think it is not well executed it is too long and I dont think Matts voice fits the style. ,Muse,cubi0yf,0,t5_2qz0k

5446286,0,t1_cw7m62r,Last time Muse played Detroit I also had presale tickets. There was a massive line at the Joe across the bridge and throughout the parking garage to get into the stadium metal detectors at the doors slowing everything down. After finding the end of the line someone came by after a few minutes asking if we had our tickets and we told them we had presale will call. They told us to follow them to get our tickets which consisted of walking the entire length of the line up to the stadium box office where we had to wait only about  minutes to get our tickets and then we were able to go right in the stadium from there. We ended up being some of the first people in instead of standing in line for what probably wouldve been an entire hour in the cold. It was awesome.,Muse,cw7td6w,3,t5_2qz0k

6392047,0,t3_434u10,gt I feel like this could develop interestingly  Muse fans tend to rate heavier complex songs higher and while a lot of that is probably rooted in attempts to rank objectively I think rock fans in general have an aversion to slow emotive songs.                Theres often an assumption that slower songs  simpler songs which really isnt the case. I realise that some faster songs may have slightly more going on instrumentally but many dont and structurewise the bpm has no effect. For example Explorers has one of the most complex chord progressions Muse have used in a song.                    As far as the original question goes Id say Invincible. Ruled by Secrecy is my favourite slow song but Im not sure it really counts as a ballad.,Muse,czg7jxb,1,t5_2qz0k

6547484,0,t1_czqz8x0,Haha! The thing I love most about Muse is how different their music is to me at different times. Its always a different emotion or experience when I listen with headphones or stereo in the car or on the beach or hiking. I just remember hearing Endlessly that time and realizing how much emphasis is put on the snare drum. How much weight of the song is carried by it and how well it was recorded. Compared to the newer stuff where the drums are softer and blend more with the melody. Im sure it had more to do with the speakers I was listening to I just happened to be high and living inside the drum because drugs. Slightly unrelated but I remember reading about how they recorded the song New Born while they were all tripping on shrooms and they mixed the song a certain way that they all thought sounded really cool. But when they went back and listened to it again sober they thought it sounded too weird and took a couple of things out. So I guess its not really deep but just emotionally powerful and personal. Music is so relative and abstract. Muse just gives me something new to love and feel every time I listen to them no matter the song or album. ,Muse,czwkagj,1,t5_2qz0k

6607583,0,t3_466168,Heres how I see iPart  The realization that the end of mankind due to its own mistakes as in pollution is inevitable.Part  In a last hope situation the world is doing what ever they can to save the human race like sending some people into space to try and find new untouched worlds where they can repopulate and continue living.Part  I imagine this all happens on their way to a new untouched world inside a rocket ship. I see it as a sad decent into madness as the narrator begins to understand that there may not be a new untouched world so they are beginning to rely solely on some type of god or something along those lines. The last words Its our last chance to forgive ourselves is a lot more mature and accepting of the situation. They know theyve wronged but are just praying for any slight opportunity to keep living. The music at the end to me symbolizes that they did not find any where to repopulate because the song ends how it began. I said before I see this part as being in space not on a planet and it kind of ends that way too. Peacefully but eerily. The whole song to me seems like its based on the Greif DABDA thing Denial Anger Bargaining Depression AcceptanceBut they kind of skip Denial. Theres kind of a part . Its the real world right now. Because this is how the world actually is. We do have a pollution problem and we are in denial of it right now but this song is based in the future judging by the fact that they can escape to other planets Weve yet to even reach Mars. So it musically starts at anger. Listen to even the chord progression its written on strings but feels angrier than grunge written by a  year old metal purist. Then the lyrics come in with stuff like I cant forgive you and I cant forget. Then Part  represents bargaining. Theyll do anything to live right now. Theyre sending innocent people into the unknown in hopes theyll find a way to survive since Earth is inhabitable right now. Part  is both depression and acceptance. The song itself is noticeably sad on first listen but the lyrics and official video drive the point home. The last line being acceptance like I said before. All in all its pretty cool.TLDR Earth is dying people are being sent to other planets to repopulate there since Earth is inhabitable. They never reach this other planet and die trying to find such a place. ,Muse,d02s313,3,t5_2qz0k

6897970,0,t1_d0y6l5i,Even though given the recent European setlists this is probably an outlier I feel like its important to note that the band doesnt see their discography the same way rMuse does. Rarity  quality and despite what everyone around here seems to think of the last three albums the band itself is obviously proud and the sales back it up. You as an individual have every right to be disappointed though why would you want to be? but from the bands perspective its a different world.As for the cost theyre apparently only breaking even and thatll be because of the ridiculous stage design and visuals which I feel a lot of people neglect when they plug the songs into their setlistrating spreadsheet.

He is the  and he has the luxury of indulging in weird opinions because he doesnt have anything to lose by doing so.  We regular people are forced to be more realistic because we have more at stake.Im not at all claiming he is a corrupt person...we dont have enough information and probably never will.  We almost have enough information to speculate that he has become outoftouch and somewhat mediocre.

10838730,0,t1_ddxt67x,Well relatively. Im surprised it beat out Showbiz actually maybe people dont know that album as well but I wouldnt say its unpredicted that it beat out US and Supremacy considering the subs general attitude,Muse,ddxxs8a,1,t5_2qz0k
10895952,0,t1_de3tgo1,What I missed was the guys running around the stage talking to the crowd except for Happy Birthday to ltnamegt! interacting with the crowd jumping stuff like that. As I said I did enjoy myself immensely it was my first Muse concert. And as for comparison with recordings no matter how you look at it you can sense the energy. ,Muse,de3u948,1,t5_2qz0k

11009169,0,t1_defu9l9,Ah yes yes yes to more philosophical stuff! I totally agree on the no more conspirationalpolitical bullshit thing. They have way too many songs about that. Enough for another decade Id say.,Muse,defux5u,2,t5_2qz0k

11229451,0,t1_df4j3sa,He was talking about something true but completely different from what Im talking about at least at firstI dont give a flying fuck if someone likes or dislikes a song I like or dislike. Im not even likely to say my opinion on it in the first place. Same thing with most of these opinion matters.What bothers me is when someone is objectively wrong yet they act like it is a matter of opinion. If I reacted the way I did to someone whos favorite color differed from mine his observation would apply. But if I reacted that way to someone who thought that anyone that liked other colors was a Nazi it would be a different discussion.,Muse,df4uddp,1,t5_2qz0k

11380816,0,t1_dflzs2p,Yeah The Handler isnt commercially viable because its a good blend of Absolution and BHAR heavy sinister and melodic.Aftermath is a throwaway piece of shit singalong ballad. ,Muse,dflzvmq,-1,t5_2qz0k

11404790,0,t3_62p1mz,I picked up hullabaloo on cd for . in a record shop. Definitely check those places out unless you care for them being brand new. If you ask me they were foolish to part with them so picking them up on the cheap is a golden moment. ,Muse,dfopvha,1,t5_2qz0k

11452740,0,t3_63emyx,I love the AM chill vibe with matts vocals. If Matt wants to rap on their new albumEPSingle I hope the instrumentation sounds a little like this. Of course muse has never really been chill so hoping for something youd hear off of Hullabaloo,Muse,dfu5qw8,7,t5_2qz0k

11630707,0,t1_dgdtaay,I wish the Ghost Stories bsdies were just on the album anyways. Theyre both really nice songs and it also makes the track list more full and complete. Why doom your album to be a short overlooked work rather than a full length but out of sequence work? Couldve given the album more credence and more people would give it another shot to hear the message and emotion. I love the album but find the deluxe edition to be necessary. ,Muse,dgecq3q,2,t5_2qz0k
