6547226,0,t1_czwj7fh,Yeah that and the rather thin science logic fallacies etc. buzz words. Not that Im against those thingsI think theyre really important.

No coincidence but its one of the more unpleasant ways in which that sub mirrors Mormonismpeople thinking they have The Truth. I prefer to think that we dont really have final answersor at least to refrain from verbally clobbering people who enjoy speculating or thinking things through for themselves.,exmo_theist,czwjbua,4,t5_3b4yi
