8738704,0,t3_4zqj8q,First of all as far as we know its currently impossible to actually see another player ingame if thats what you meant by running into other people.On topic Ive jumped through a couple black holes and to date Ive only seen one system that someone else had already discovered. I wouldnt say I regret it but I wont be jumping through black holes anymore because there doesnt seem to be an advantage over direct jumps toward the center with a fully upgraded warp drive in fact black holes seem to give a pretty good chance for one or more of your modules to break bummer.My take on black holes is that they move you an insignificant distance toward the center but they move you laterally by a huge amount. So at best you put yourself a little close to the center less than if you had just done a normal jump with an upgraded drive and you lose the ability to follow your path backwards to revisit past discoveries.TLDR I cant see any reason to jump through black holes unless maybe you really hate the region of the galaxy youre travelling through?,nomanshigh,d6xzkky,2,t5_3forn

Ive decided its not worth trying to keep stocks of stuff on me just in case so I stick to carbon and iron on my suit and plutioniom and thamium on my ship and farm the rest when I need it.

Go back up and pick something up or kill a sentinel to aggro.Jump back in the whole and move to the end of the tunnel so that there is just earth above you. Just stay there till you aggro all the way till the big guy comes. During the waiting period you can look up and you will see the sentinel above you but they are trying to take the shortest distance to you. Ok now for the fun stuff. Go to the tunnel so you can see the sky. The small sentinels will come and you can just pick them off.  The dog will fall in the hole and die.  The big guy can be killed by widening the top of the hole so you can see a bit of him. Now just shoot him. He wont be able to hit you.

No idea on moneyexcept to buy Omegon I had stopped using it and didnt bother to do anything to get more money beyond completing planets. Despite having completed a lot of planetsI only warped to systems with four or moonsplanetsI hadnt reached level ten yet.

10827153,0,t3_5utmvg,Well I started off culling Monopods to reduce the spread of the Overmind. then I stopped culling them and started running away from them as the Dread Overmind was Psionically doing my head in by making me feel all guilty. Now I am running around spraying them instead with a Purple Goop Strain the PGSC that mutates them  liberating them from the collective of the evil mental singularity  and turning them into true parts of the local Goopsphere Ecosystem. Naturally I capture their image afterwards and log them for posterity because a fellow must record his tiny amounts of progress within the vastness of infinity.,nomanshigh,ddwqt39,3,t5_3forn

11363846,0,t3_6211qy,Nope never seen a Theta. But i feel your need. And i have one funny thing to share. If you wanna go fast then experiment with the hovercraft. There is a glitch which propels you out of it when you exit it and your barrel velocity  so to say D  seems to be about  ms or higher which is about as much as upgraded pulsedrive ship can go near any planet surface  so really fast. This glitch starts to happen to me after i spend some  minutes roaming around in the hovercraft with regular onfoot short trips so mounting and dismounting it many times. If youd find a way to aim yourself upwards without needing any ricochet st which reduces speed  please let me know OK? DAnd if you want to see what im talking about  well this is it ,nomanshigh,dfk2jj0,1,t5_3forn
11371692,0,t1_dfkm5xc,Guess difference is in the eye of the beholder. Also I can understand why they did things this way. They always stated it was a science fiction trope to have a planet with one primary biome. The idea being to move on to another planet if you want something different. If they squeeze it all onto every planet saying they could without drastically altering the engine why would you seek out other worlds. In addition you have to consider how many more art assets and so on might be needed to have any variety between multiple biome worlds.Soon folks would be complaining that all the worlds have the same multiple biomes on them  with no variety between  so why go to any other. So funny that some person thought my last comment was worth a downvote too normally this sub is better than such pettiness about  an honest  opinion.,nomanshigh,dfkykor,3,t5_3forn
