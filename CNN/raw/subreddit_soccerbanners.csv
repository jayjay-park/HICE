11779165,0,t3_680ghu,I wonder for how long is he going to be banned from football for this. Footballers usually try to go for soft headbutts to avoid harsher punishments but a proper punch like this could probably give him like  to  months or even more. I dont know if it fits into the exact same category but Roman Eremenko got banned for  years for failing a drug test cocaine.,soccerbanners,dgv7f5n,1,t5_2xktn
