8241944,0,t1_d4vyqig,Hello there! Production Manager here.I was wondering if youve had the time to think about any recurring features you would want to write for the Quibbler so items that will return in every issue we publishKeep in mind that you will still have to bring any ideas to Starflashfairy first before bringing them to me.Ill direct you to this post and I hope to hear from you soon! Even if its to tell me you wont be doing any recurring features.Thanks!,TheQuibbler,d57src7,2,t5_322n7

8482702,0,t1_d61f03z,Things are going well. I submitted my first article to uMoostronus and it appears to have been edited so I think Im good to go? Can either of you correct me if Im wrong? Is there another step I need to do now that the article has been edited by the Department Head?,TheQuibbler,d61vs4w,3,t5_322n7
8844892,0,t1_d7azzm1,The link for submission is in the sidebar on the right.  It wouldnt hurt to tell the editor of the department youre submitting to what it is youre working on just in case someone is already working on that or it has been written before.    What did you have in mind about CC?  Id say it would go in the Entertainment section so thats the office Id post in.  umarsthemush is the new editor.  Thats where coloring pages would go too I think.  Im not sure how that would work with how we produce The Quibbler however as its published online though there is a .pdf version available.

9046448,0,t3_544rnt,How many times do I have to tell you about those shears? How do you feel about socks?  Pizza or chocolate?  What is your weirdest fear?  What is your deepest darkest secret? You get one insanely mundane superpower. What is it? If you could use one Hallow which would it be?  Would you rather have a lifetime supply of pizza you couldnt eat or soda you couldnt drink? First generation Pokmon or Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? What did you eat for lunch yesterday? Are you having fun with us?  And finally who is your favorite fairy? No pressure but if it isnt me youre fired.,TheQuibbler,d7z8leq,3,t5_322n7
