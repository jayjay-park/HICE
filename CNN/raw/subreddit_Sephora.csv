11607305,0,t1_dgben6s,I like what Ive tried so far.  I have been using Buffet Advanced Retinoid Marula Oil and the AHABHA peeling Solution and love all of them.  I was using Drunk Elephant and think the following are good dupes Marula Oil Peeling Solution for Baby Facial Buffet for B HydraI also have the alpha arbutin and squalene.  I havent used the alpha arbutin long enough to say if its working but the squalene is really nice and great for days my skin feels extra dry.,Sephora,dgbp4ul,3,t5_2uols
