93587,0,t3_1v5pvu,This seems to be really well produced and executed perfectly. Ill be honest its a little bit of all over the place...and Im not quite sure if Im listening to a song or dropping some hits of ear acid patent pending. Its not really a song I did a whole lot but whatever it is youve done it very well. I dont know if I really have any constructive criticism beyond that. I know that if you make it and you like it then theres plenty of other people out there that do. Hope you keep making music man. Id like to see what else you have.,Songwriters,cep32ge,2,t5_2qtpz

When Im out of a grueling series of exams I will have time to properly go through everything  I think everything youve said is spot on and will elevate the song considerably! Youve taken a lot of time to help me here and I may be in touch for some of the particulars namely The whole section kind of hovers around the B before this happens and I think if you keep the B note and reintroduce the A beneath it you still have a transition chord that flows better into the next chord. Id love to flesh that out a bit more but Im not entirely sure with how to execute that one. Im blown away honestly thank you again. ,Songwriters,cev9f0b,1,t5_2qtpz

3394678,0,t3_2z2om9,Im not trying to be rude in any way. I am just giving constructive criticism. That being said it sounds like you just wrote down the first thing that popped into your head  when you were writing this song. A lot of the phrases you used e.g. Waiting for the DJ to play my song My feet are on repeat. Aint no time to sleep etc. sound very clich and amateurish.I can imagine that with a decent instrumental this could make for an ok pop song but please take some time to think about the lyrical content of your songs. Tell a story. ,Songwriters,cpf7xja,4,t5_2qtpz
3429264,0,t1_cpi6uwz,No problem.  I get excited when I hear good in a place like this.  Id say the first thing you need to do is stop focusing on everything you dont know.  Work with what you do know and use it as a base to build from. The first guitar thing I would do is practice the hell out of your song and make sure you can land on those chord forms right on the one and in your sleep.  Thats simply a repetition thing put in the work.  Now to your question Youre going to have to smallstep everything but stay focused on moving in one direction for a little bit.  Even great guitarists today tend to fall into the mile wide and an inch deep zone when it comes to playing ability and getting better.  You dont have to do that. One thing will eventually bleed into another anyway.  If you think about how other things are learned  be it science math engineering etc  theyre organized into units. Developing skills in one area or one aspect of instrumental performance or anything isnt a completely autonomously beneficial act. It works synergistically with other aspects of the instrument. Making real headway in the area of scales for instance will help establish deeper understanding of chords and chord construction.  Now most guitarists youll find didnt learn like this because most guitarists pieced everything together by figuring out songs on the radio and getting transcriptions but you can see a lot of limitations in that by the way they play  and more so in how they teach when they become guitar teachers beside the point.  The point is that there is usually a lack of structure in learning the guitar and development tends to slow down because of it.  Im telling you this because its a clue into how you can most efficiently get better and trim a lot of the bullshit. and a clue toward building guitar lessons with a qualified teacher if you decide that you want some help.   Im a professor of guitar and the director of a performing arts program by the way  thinking about this is quite literally my job.  The good news is that you seem to know more than youre selling here. What I meant when I said that I see the capacity for you to be a good guitarist is that youre clearly in the novice range of ability but youre refusing to stay comfortable and play simple open chords with a capo or down at the bottom of your guitar... Instead youre moving laterally on the neck and its paying off... the range youre harmonizing in is a great marriage with your voice. In addition to that I hear ninths sharp ths and all sorts of sonically interesting voicings happening in the song. Again showing musical intelligence beyond ability at this point. Its hard for me to get a read on what you can do based only on the song you played but let me ask you a couple questions to see if I could suggest a unit of study for you  If I were going to play the piano along with you on this tune would you be able to tell me which chords youre playing?    Would you be able to draft up a quick lead sheet with chord names?  Do you know what chord degrees and scale degrees are?   What are modes and where do they come from?  What key is your tune in? Dont worry if you cant answer any of them. Let me know if you get the chance.  ,Songwriters,cpj5u55,1,t5_2qtpz

I seemed to have jammed the lines together and left a bunch of empty spaces in between them in other parts. And you know I told myself to make sure I counted stresses in my lines and I never ended up doing it because Ive focused most of my rewrites on making sure the story was clear. I thnk I have that part down theres not confusion about what Im trying to say but youre totally right. The rhythm of the words is off and Ill take that to the woodshed for my next edit.

I feel like you almost have to unlearn language in order to think and write just words instead of sentences and paragraphs.You also dont have to write from beginning to end in order.

Its a good way for people to hear your music and know if its something theyre interested in. And the more time you spend playing music out the more musicians youll meet and make friends with and you can pull from there.    Online  craigslist has been good to me. Sometimes it can be bad. Sometimes you get someone in the band for a month before they change their mind.

6108842,0,t3_3z7ih9,I feel its a bit lacking in content.  If youre trying to tell a story the song should be longer with more detail so we feel more for the characters.  Maybe a bit more subtlety with the racial aspect as well.  Emphasize their similarities more than their differences talk about why theyre in love then bring in the colour of their skin later to make sense of why their parents dont approve.Also I cant understand why Joe and Lynn suddenly turned to drugs it sounds like you were trying to make the ending as sad as possible.  You could make a happier ending they leave their parents and live a tough life but its their tough life together without boundaries or again you could add a bit of detail to help us understand why they went down the path of addiction.Also I feel you overuse the word yeah.  Maybe change up the chorus a bit instead of repeating the same line.  For exampleNow Joe and I are leavingYeah Joe and I are leavingGot a car that we can sleep inAnd our love will never weakenSo Joe and I are leavingSay goodbyeI dont know thats just off the top of my head I dont know the melody you have in mind or the music that goes with it.

6933461,0,t3_4ao6hq,The sound is certainly better than some random garagephone recording. Im thinking you could use these tracks as they are to do some promotion without feeling embarassed. A few things could be tweaked though to make a clearer mix.  Perhaps when recording the guitars make sure youve activated the metronome so you can check that everything is on time. This helps to get percussive sounds right like on My Half and also makes it much easier to record with multiple tracks in general.  Maybe add a light compression to the voice as some words tend to disappear into the guitar a bit. The overall mix is a bit messy possibly because the voice and guitar are occupying the same frequencies. Maybe try to see what frequencies are most prominent on the vocal track and cut a few dBs of those frequencies on the guitar track. It should help to clean up the sound and make it clearer.  Your songs are very nice to listen to good luck! ,Songwriters,d128fjh,1,t5_2qtpz

8483644,0,t3_4vv2ai,This chord progressions in this song remind me a lot of Alex Turners solo stuff. So does the singing. Thats not necessarily a bad thing everyone starts off somewhere. Its really cool that youre finishing songs at all too many people take that for granted.You have a lot of lyrical content ready to go as well as chord progressions for a chorus and a verse. Maybe take what you have now and focus on arrangement approaching the song in a purposeful manner. Cutting the song down in time a bit maybe to like  could be a good idea not a hard and fast rule but setting some loose rules in arranging might help you give the song more direction. Ultimately I think arrangement will help this song the most.,Songwriters,d6201gz,4,t5_2qtpz
