11717032,0,t1_dgo0itm,To be honest I always use my gold  star flash for all bosses. Its lvl  with about k points. I dont switch characters unless flash died. For bosses that has automatic switch I just take out the other  characters or else they mess me up. When flash dashes he avoids  damage so they deal  damage to me,injustice2mobile,dgo5kx6,2,t5_3f0dg
