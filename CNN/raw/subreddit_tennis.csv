4553,0,t1_ceeqebf,Why do racket manufacturers make rackets? So they can sell them. How do they sell them? They convince people to buy them. How do they do that? They market them. How do they market them? By and large they make false claims.People like the familiar. When youre a  year old kid and you get your first real adult racket half the time someone else chooses it for you. And when they dont you grab something that feels right to you. And when youre very good and you have success you dont change unless you have to.So if Im  right now what are my choices? How many  rackets are out there?  of the rackets out there are  and above because the racket companies have convinced the public that those rackets are more powerful even though racket head size has nothing to do with power. Its all perception and the perception isnt based on the actual science.If I pick up a  and a  of otherwise identical specs they will play basically identically to me. I can feel an ever so slight difference between them but will it noticeably affect the quality of my play? No.,tennis,ceeyevw,1,t5_2qiq1

45367,0,t1_cejkz9m,Our other issue here is racquet construction.  Most of the smaller racquets are going to be thinner heavier more flexible beams often with a more balancedhead light balance point.  Larger racquets will be overall a bit lighter slightly more head heavy in most cases and certainly stiffermore powerful FRAMES.  I would argue that the actual power potential of the sweet spot in a sqin is actually great than say a sq in. Larger string beds make each string longer between the frame.  I would argue that due to laws of diminished returns a larger racquet will increase the sweetspot but NOT the power potential. Putting a sqin racquet in a  year old mans hands will allow him to enjoy the game and have the same experiences as a  year old Federer simply by increasing the string beds margin for error and creating a racquet that can still perform with a halfswing.

There are always some on ebay but then you have to deal with finding the right grip size and proper condition.I think you should try customizing your Babolat Pure Drive Team with lead tape to find the exact weight balance and swingweight that you like.  After that you should demo racquets that are close or can be customized to your preferred specs.  A racquet is a very personal thing   so dont feel the need to use a certain racquet with a certain balance.  As to actually recommending a frame I would suggest looking into the Head Radical racquets.  In my experience those are pretty solid for a flatter all court game.  ,tennis,cffbsjr,2,t5_2qiq1

395812,0,t1_cflfmkc,Oh theres absolutely no denying Nadal and Djokovic are great. Its just that they are a logical extension of Federer  the same wellroundedness and ability to transition between offense and defense just with different styles. They are also products of their time  theyve both benefited hugely from the homogenization of the surfaces and the general slowing down of the courts and hence the game.Thats really another factor that separated Roger to me. He won Wimbledon serve and volleying when it was still pretty quick. Then he won it  times from the baseline when it was slower. Hes won fast slams slow slams medium slams. He truly is a man for all surfaces in a way the others are not. Nadal has adapted his game to faster surfaces in an admirable manner but I really question what his career would have been like if the US Open had stayed as fast as it used to be and Wimbledon had stayed as quick as it used to be. With Federer there are no doubts in that regard.,tennis,cflsiq9,1,t5_2qiq1
396136,0,t3_1yj8cu,Ive always thought the best coaches in almost all sports are the journeymen not the freaks with special physical gifts. Adam Carolla said something similar once about how women shouldnt take beauty tips from a world class beauty a .  Instead you want tips from a woman who is a  or  but became a  or  by learning how to maximize her looks.  Similarly in sports the guy who wasnt the fastest or strongest but made a mark in his sport no matter how small but studying the game to death and maximizing his technique strategy and point construction thats the guy who can take a tennis physical freak give him his brain and create a champion.But Goran and Cilic raises a good point.  Ive never considered that maybe its not about technique or point construction for a lot of the top guys but simply believing in themselves enough to take advantage of those  or  points that determine a match at the highest ATP levels.  In those instances you might believe in a Grand Slam champion more be more energized by somebody like that if only out of hero worship.  ,tennis,cfltqai,2,t5_2qiq1

509057,0,t1_cfy4mnj,Its usually up to the umpires discretion to replay the point or award the point.  The usual ruling for an out call prior or during contact with the ball is to replay the point.  However in this case it was quiet obvious that Harrison did not have a legitimate play on the ball.I tried searching the rulebooks but could not find specific rulings regarding successful challenges.  A level of subjectivity like this in officiating will always invite trouble.  Im sure Harrison would have been the one arguing had the point been awarded to Fognini.  ,tennis,cfy4sb0,5,t5_2qiq1

In general you want to be more stable while hitting your shot so only do the latter if you are really rushed and want to recover quickly.If you mean he should slide after hitting the ball I disagree. This is one of the reasons hard court players have trouble on clay.

624521,0,t1_cg9pr6n,If you arent having trouble generating spin with your normal racquet then its got to be a launch angle issue. The strings are hitting too much of the bottom of the ball. That will kill your spin production and cause your shots to sail. Youll have to close the racquet face a bit more than youre used to. A couple of degrees makes a huge difference. How you do that is up to you. Rolling your grip over a bit pronating more changing your timing. Youll have to experiment. This article helped me a lot when I was having the same problem. Your forehand may be too developed to make such a change though. And you might want to give the Blades another try. The BLX lines should feel quite a bit different than the old KBlades. Either way there are a ton of racquets in that spec range. Almost all the Babolats  the Yonex Ai  and Vcore Head Prestige and Speed Prince Graphite Volkl  or C ect.

674649,0,t3_21vfnq,Lets go through those  GS finals since the  Australian French Rafa on that court  the rain delay  unwinnable match. US Open Djokovic was falling over a lot in the first set or two IIRC and the wind really bothered him while Andy was just determined as hell and a great wind player. Credit to him for getting two sets back but Murray got his form back in the th and there ya go. Aussie He won so NBD. Wimbledon After that epic semifinal playing against arguably the secondbest grass court player next to Federer that would have been incredible for Djokovic to pull off. Its not like he didnt have his chances he led in all three sets I think?. Just came against a better player on the day. He didnt play badly at all. US Nadal was playing like a mile inside the baseline when hes playing that far up the court with that much confidence its hard for anyone to compete.So I dont think its really a mystery why he lost some of those I think maybe the  US Open he had the best chance of winning and played his relatively worst tennis but the rest I dont think he played bad at all he was just outmatched on the day.,tennis,cggyhqz,9,t5_2qiq1

804792,0,t3_23anj9,Ive seen Nadal track down dropshots after retrieving a  mph forehand being pulled wide and  feed behind the baseline. I dont think a dropshot serve is going to do the job.  A trick serve like this might work once or twice but theres no way this is a viable tactic against any pro. Even if you accept that such an overhand serve could be hit consistently with decent disguise which I highly doubt I still dont think it could work.Heres why While Nadal may stand  feet behind the baseline to return hes not just standing there like most of us do. I guarantee his contact point for the serve is at least  ft in front of where hes standing. Any pro times their split step to the serve and will want to be moving forward into the return or move at an angle to get to wide serves. You serve short and Nadal has already taken his split step and started to move in. Congrats you just gave Nadal a short ball to attack. Plus Nadal can generate the type of spin to get that ball over the net and down into the court at an dangerous angle. ,tennis,cgvrbcj,1,t5_2qiq1

859169,0,t3_23yrs3,First it is unusual for Rafa to struggle in these two tournaments.  He had won Monte Carlo eight straight years and reached the finals for  straight years.  Rafa hadnt lost in Barcelona since  although he did skip it one year.  Rafa has lost in Rome and Madrid before so its not like he wins all the clay events heading up to the French Open.Admittedly Rafa has never lost to Almagro in  tries even though Almagro has a power game that you would think would bother Rafa.The question is whats up?  The only thing Ive heard is the back injury that Rafa had at the Australian Open which was affecting his ability to train which is odd given he was off the tour for  months though one imagines he was able to train.Rafa seems to be the kind of player that needs to hit lots of balls to keep in tiptop shape and normally he does this.  His practices seem more intense than most even onsite while a player like Federer looks to the longterm to stay as healthy as he can for as long as he can so hes willing to forgo insane practices and its not clear that this kind of practice would help everyone.Still the score against Almagro was somewhat close and I think theres still only a small handful of people that could beat Rafa on clay and best of  should improve his chances short of an injury.,tennis,ch1xxra,6,t5_2qiq1

1002496,0,t3_25iua0,Id say you have to use some high end statistics to model the data you have and then check whether your model has relevant inputs.google modelling sportsbetting and click  or ten links read them all and then decide what direction you want to take or are able to take given level of difficulty prior knowledge etc.for example read thisIm sure if you develop a model and then will have to test if parameters are relevant  if you need new parameters etc.if was to start with this I would try and get data for the surface as well as what you have for example players like nadal or fognini might win  games on clay and isner might win  so that in my opinion would be an important factor. head to head statistics would be key too. a very useful tool to see if your model  when you get it going is anywhere near what the market predicts is to compare your prices to what is on tennis.betfair.comfor example tomorrow raonic is a slight underdog against tsonga.raonic . v tsonga .in my head  I would have tsonga as . or . as my price for him. pre match. so I will probably back tsonga .. thats just my intuition based on seeing matches of both raonic and tsonga.tennis.wettpoint.com can show you stats including tie breaker stats  sets won that go to tie breaker etcmatchstat.com for head to head stats player stats etc.are you just doing this for fun and or do you actually want to bet on tennis? you should understand that sportsbooks as in betting shops sports books online will take a significant amount of your potential profit in their prices. as their lines are normally much worse value than sports betting exchanges likebetfair exchange betdaq matchbookgoogle these. betfair is the best for liquidity. all of these charge commission betfair is  on profit but still considerably better value than betting shops or sportsbooks.if you live outside of america and can use betfair exchange then only use a sportsbook when the price is better than the exchange otherwise you are losing value each time you take a lower price.for example I have money in bet and betfair  and if at the end of a set bet price is better than betfair price . I back on bet and lay  bet against google it if needs be at a lower price on betfair  adjusting stakes to consider commission  that is a risk free profit if price doesnt change by the time you get it done. if you bet in play stats that may be useful are  time player loses first set but wins the match if lets say that is gt across all surfaces and the odds are gt evens after the first then there is value. etc.if you can use betfair.com I know a profesional trader that has a low risk strategy for tennis. its not a get rich quick scheme but has potential for reasonable profits regularly. so if you message me I can give you his email and you can buy his ebook for around  GBP.it is worth it.so long story short google compliling sports books oddsor modelling sports betting  and youll get some direction,tennis,chi8psq,1,t5_2qiq1

Both Murray and Djokovic can attack on high shots.what????????  non sense items here. first these  handers do not want to hit high shots over shoulders. the only time they want this is on the fh side not bh. second murray and novak can attack on high shotsyou are mixing it up. on the fh yes not bh.to add the biggest factor with novak is his improved serve over the years. he really fixed his technique. i been saying for years nadal will break down.....its about time,tennis,chmf0bj,1,t5_2qiq1

1247595,0,t1_ci9gb5d,I dont play tennis anymore but I used to play competitively and was ranked in the top ten in my state. Anyways I think shrewd got it mostly right about your serve. I would just add that it looks like from your video you dont use your legs very much on your serve and I actually think this is your serves biggest weakness. A lot of people dont understand the fact that incorporating your legs more into your shots serve especially not only increases the power and spin you can hit with but actually improves your consistency too. To expand on this lets look a your current motion. You seem to get most of your drive from using your back like a hingeslight knee bend then arching back and snapping forward with your lower back. This harms your serve in two ways it severely limits the amount of drive i.e. power and spinwhich helps reduce errors you can serve with and lowers your consistency by putting extraneous motion into your serve. The serve is the most complicated motion in tennis and a consistent serve starts with as consistent and repeatable motion as possible. Take a look at Sampras serve and pay extra attention to his overall simple motion deep knee bend and relatively straight back So working on learning to bend and drive with your legs and letting your torsoarm simply transfer the power will really add consistency to your serve. Also a quick note on strokes going blubbery during a match. Often due to the pressure of playing in a match vs. just practicing people tend to play a little more careful. In tennis this usually means a drop in your racket head speed on all your strokes which despite your bodys instinct otherwise actually makes you more likely to miss. Dont let your nerves get the best of you and try to concentrate on keeping your racket speed up. ,tennis,ci9yxfy,1,t5_2qiq1

Theres no way djokovic will allow Federer to dominate his service games like he has done. On the other hand Djokovic has been unsteady throughout and has allowed  opponents to come back in the match. Both Dimitrov and Cilic choked away a real chance to win against him and I dont think Federer with his experience will do the same if the chance offers itself.Conclusion Match is on Djokovics racquet but he has to lift his level and avoid mental lapses.

Let me just say though that Womens tennis is a highly sexualized sport. Im not saying this is good or bad but thats just the way it is. Most of the money is coming from sponsorship deals and thus Sharapova is often getting paid to model things for her attractivness just like Wozniacki Ivanovic etc.  Maybe if Serena was white people would view her as more attractive and have her sponsor a wider range of products but this has nothing to do with the WTA discriminating against players and race.,tennis,cjpf9zq,4,t5_2qiq1

She is by far the most consistent in slams this year.  If she cements another semifinal at the USO she is my vote for break out player of the year perhaps Halep. She has great mental toughness and is feared on both wings. Im looking forward to her development and theres no doubt she will win a slam. Hopefully she doesnt pull a Murray and wins one soon.

However the umpire gave the point to Jerzy which justifiably made Sousa furious. Jerzy admitted that he touched the ball but refused to concede the point because according to him the umpire made an unfair call against him earlier in the game.

I have guidelines that I use for adults but for kids it is especially hard because they all physically develop at different rates.When I eyeball it Im really look at their ability to handle the weight. Head size is not important to me for developing players  the weight and balance are critical. Im looking to see if the player needs to overuse their hipsshoulders to pull the racquet head through the shot. If so then they are playing with a stick thats too heavy.When we are talking about adults I think that there is no reason to start with a beginner racquet and move up. Pick a racquet that is in the right weightbalance range for you that you like the feel of and use it until you are good. Then you can refine your choices.,tennis,ck03bdb,1,t5_2qiq1

I just picked the Aero Pro drive as it was a similar feel to my last one and brand new.So here goes  Aero Pro Drive  Feels pretty good have tried a couple heavier racquets and have no issues with them either  No arm  shoulder issues weightlift a lot now so tennis doesnt feel taxing whatsoever these days.  I play fairly competitively number I was given is a . most unforced errors go long. Serve is usually good sometimes elusive. Twice a week playing outdoors. Id consider myself a nonspecialist mostly a pusher sometimes going to net to strike sometimes playing a baseline rally. I play with a very tabletennisy style lots of spin and drop shots  lobs.  Colour means nothing to me.  Brand is also not an issue.  Just got some RPM Blast strings on my Aero Pro Drive love the spin old table tennis player so I use a lot of spin Dont know tension got asked about my playstyle by the guy who does the stringing at the club shop and he forgot the description tag he usually puts on after doing them.  Broken one set of strings in my life played tennis on  off for  years now  Quality trumps all concerns for me latest tech is not really necessary my current racquet is from .  Was thinking about trying the RF I have a one handed backhand  another holdover from table tennis previously  and liked the Wilson model that Serena Williams currently uses a friend let me try it felt nice on the HBH.Thanks if you can help.,tennis,cl3odqn,1,t5_2qiq1
2082373,0,t1_cl4e6tp,If youre gonna demo try some new racquets out and experiment. Ask the guys for two different styles of racquets and try them out. Usually with demo programs you can come back to the store and exchange your demo racquets for more demos so you could hypothetically try them all. Try out a bunch. Common player favourites that I notice? Yonex TourG Wawrinka Babolat Aeropro Drive Nadal Wilson Steam S similar to Nishikoris who plays with the Steam .The first two are great for brushing up against the ball and generating pace. The Steam S feels incredible and is my racquet of choice I bought it very recently after demoing it several times among other racquets and nothing could compare.It is all about preference at the end of the day so try those out see what you like. The new Fed racquet should be out too and it seems like itd be great if you like a heavy stable racquet,tennis,cl4ik5u,1,t5_2qiq1

2140132,0,t3_2jcvw9,Note I am very very picky when it comes to tennis rackets. I have switched rackets a total of one time over the past  years. Just this year I purchased  rackets and decided to go with them for now. I love my swing and strokes just the way they are and if Wilson still made my  year old racket today I would not hesitate to buy it. Wilson Hyper Pro Staff .  sq in with  lbs tension twisted razor strings.My local tennis club allows me to demo any racket they have available. I dont pay much attention to strings or tension I pay more attention to how the racket swings how it feels in my hands its maneuverability and overall weight. To put it simply just overall how it feels when I swing it around. I rate each racket for feel on forehand backhand serves and volleys. When I started demoing this year I tried out nearly  different rackets from the pro shop until I found one that was pretty close to my old racket. I decided to just go with it and bought four of them.Once I got them strung to my old rackets specs it just didnt hit right. Not enough control for sure. Over the course of several months and about  different string setups I ended up switching the strings out to a different poly raised the tension from  to almost  in  lb increments and now it plays beautifully. More power than before slightly less control and spin but I guess you cant have it all.TLDR  Demo LOTS of rackets find the one that feels right when you swing then finetune using different string setups  tensions until you find the combo that works perfectly for you.,tennis,clbuwna,2,t5_2qiq1

I cant think of any other sport where you basically have to be in the state of trance for several hours without any breaks with so many things that can go wrong. The scoring system in tennis is cruel you can have  match points at one moment and  minutes later be packing the bag to go home. Its no wonder you see so many temper tantrums even in high level tennis. Not a team sport. Which means theres a lot more tension for the player. More opportunities for choking up. The players dont control the ball for the whole play theres no offencedefence situation so distractions can ruin it for both players including the one being cheered.Just try playing some tennis say next to a busy parking lot. If youre winning easily its not so bad. But start losing or having a hard time winning and every little thing becomes a distraction. Now imagine that there are rankings titles and millions at stake.

Most of federers early slams are against a random assortment of players that all made a couple of deep slam runs. Its not as though he consistently denied slams to a tier of players that only he was above. Rafa on the other hand has excelled in the era of the Big Four and has a positive winloss against almost all of them Including federer.

2880042,0,t1_cnuxaw2,He is absolutely not a fighter though. Monfils is powered by adrenalin and the crowd. Often he goes  sets up against higher ranking players and then drops the next  sets because his opponent put up a bigger fight. You can see in his posture and change to his playstyle how quickly he typically gives up when he is suddenly being countered at every point.In the game recently where he went  sets down in the third set he had a kick ass game and broke serve early. This just kickstarted his comeback and fueled him enough for a few more really well played points which in turn fueled him enough for the rest of the match. Its not because he is mentally as tough as your typical fighters its because it only takes one awesome game to get him fired up and playing all out. Hes not the kind of player who looks at a  set deficit and says I can get myself out of this! hes the sort of player who goes on the super defensive until he can play a great point to get him fired up again.

3333014,0,t3_2ycdiq,Tennis is a game of matchups. Nadals high topspin forehand hurts Federers backhand. Federers low slice is harder for Djokovic to hit because Novak often hits a flat ball. Nadals forehand goes right into Djokovics comfort zone. As for Murray Federer had trouble with him earlier on because Andy is a counterpuncher. Federer has had a fair amount of trouble against them. Now the gap has widened because Murray has slipped due to injury and Federer has begun to come in more to finish points off quickly. ,tennis,cp86u7i,21,t5_2qiq1

3382633,0,t3_2yxbds,The rackets Ive been using a lot lately BLX PS .

The PS is the perfect racket if you can consistently hit the sweet spot and dont mind the weight. Others maybe easier on the arm and more forgiving but you dont get that feeling of being able to place the ball on a dime.EDIT Also people claim that it was the most forgiving of the pro staffs that came before it.

Sampras basically did that late in his career where he decided he wouldnt expend energy to win tournaments to give himself a chance at Wimbledon or the US Open.Sampras was barely winning titles but reached the US Open finals in   and .Having said that Wawrinka shouldnt have the wear and tear of a Sampras.Wawrinkas highs are very high.

3498862,0,t3_30842q,Im going to share my experience with starting tennis at a late age. I come from a tennis family so I was exposed to it my whole life started hitting for fun in eighth grade and started playing matches soon after.It wasnt until going to high school where I started group lessons and those dont help much when youre only hitting  hours a week.Starting junior year I began to train intensely. Private and group lessons with a fantastic coach and top  players from my region and I improved the skill part of my game immensely. I continued this until college and am on a weaker D team.While it is clear I am up to par skill wise with all my teammates my mental side of the game lacks compared to all of the ones who started young. That is what you miss the most you learn so much from playing how to construct and react to points. How to deal with mental stresses you just see the game differently with the time put in.Im currently improving much faster than my teammates but I have a lot of mental catch up necessary to be able to consistently beat them. ,tennis,cpr3gio,1,t5_2qiq1

Lets not forget when the ATP turned down an offer by Larry Ellison to dramatically increase Indian Wells prize money. Wimbledon makes  mil profit in two weeks. The US Open brought in  mil revenue in  the French Open  mil ... there are other expenses but payouts to players were around  milThe fact that Federer has made just  million in his ATP career is a joke.  Giancarlo Stanton isnt a household name and he plays baseball in a town that doesnt even care about baseball ... and he just signed a mil contract.  Alex Rodriguez has signed a  million contract not once but twice.  Federer is the biggest name possibly ever in tennis and over his career hes made about as much as a mediocre starting pitcher in baseball.  Unions people.

4025585,0,t3_36jowv,I think its difficult to compare team sports to individuals.  Its really apples and oranges.Team sports rely on local appeal.  If youre from New York youre probably going to support the local New York team.  There are exceptions of course.  There are many Washington DC  residents that are fans of the Dallas Cowboys generally considered the rival to the Washington Redskins.Some fans labor a long time for success.  Boston Red Sox fans lamented how long they had to wait to win a World Series of course theyve won it a few times now.  Chicago Cubs wonder if theyll ever contend.  But despite losses they tend to stay faithful to their downtrodden teams.  Successful teams like the Yankees and yes the Lakers of yesteryear tend to dash the dreams of their home teams.Individual sports by contrast are all about liking the player.  Theres no other commitment than maybe national allegiance.  However tennis fans have always been more about the player than their nationality.  Thus some prefer the winning ways of Federer over the whining of Andy Roddick.And individual sports tend to be about the winners and longevity.  Even with a losing team you might find a player you like even if that player is far from the best.  The NBA has some  teams?  And at least half the teams have a very good player and sometimes very good players.  Thats already more than a dozen highly rated players that people can admire.In tennis it often boils down the top ten possibly even the top .  The reason is somewhat simple.  These are the players most likely to play late into a tournament.  If your favorite player is James Ward good luck finding any timely footage.  On the other hand even the worst baseball team is shown locally to its fans.Now there are things specific to Federer.  First he seems like a nice guy.  He doesnt yell much.  He stays pretty calm.  His game is considered elegant to watch.  When he was at his best mid s he seemed to win because he was more perfect than other players so when Nadal came up with his bullish style Fed fans began to dislike Nadal intensely hoping hed get hurt retire early etc.Nadal fans on the other hand probably disliked how much Federer won and supported him.  They liked his diligence his modesty how he never throws a racquet how he doesnt give up on points.So sometimes when you decide you like one player you do it at the expense of other players.  Federer fans may dislike Nadal and Djokovic.  Nadal fans may dislike Djokovic and Federer etc.There are fans who like them all of course.But to answer your question its partly because it is an individual sport but there have been players like Marcelo Rios that fans have not liked because they werent pleasant people willing to be nice to the media.  That happens in team sports too but some people tolerate it a little more.  Occasionally with people like Tiger Woods they may like him because he wins even if he hasnt always been so friendly and likes to curse on the golf course.,tennis,crf5a1m,5,t5_2qiq1

4197161,0,t3_38wtqy,His clay court season has been the best it has been in his whole career considering he dislikes the surface he has become a lot better on it.His draw at the French was absolutely difficult with some big hitters in his path and his important point to boot was how he outthought those players by reducing his serve speed and bringing a lot of variety to his game ie slices and drop shots which we know he has in his locker.Here is one essential point this year for Murray which is he went incredibly aggressive at the Aus Open Final against Djokovic in the first two sets won one and lost one. He then suffered a mental breakdown in Set  to lose the set after being ahead and then lost his way in the forth. At the French it was slightly different he wasnt able to play any aggressive tennis in the first two sets and two loose service games in both sets and lost both. He bounced back by making his own aggressive tennis at the business ends of both sets and had a much more positive outlook at the end of each of the rd amp th sets. He then loses his intensity in the fifth to an onfire and recomposed Nole. Again Murray played a rather loose service game to gift an early break.If anything this year Murray is actually stopping himself from toppling Nole by not being able to be aggressive enough in the right manner. Murray has the game to take Nole down as they both play very similar styles of physical long drawn out baseline rallies the difference has always been for Murray the mental aspect of his game. Itd be worth noting that in the sets that Murray won against Nole this year he managed to play a lot more variety when in a base line exchange by slicing and always going the distance with Nole as in always making Nole play an extra shot to win a rally therefore forcing mistakes to be made at Noles end. The sets he lost he either didnt play as much variety or wasnt able to chop and change it.I think he will go away now and take a positive step towards the Grass amp Hard Court seasons. Itll be interesting to see Queens amp Wimbledon and how his movement maybe different considering the drastic changes he took to change his movement style on clay it will be interesting to see how that translates to his grass season.I think he can win one of the two remaining slams this year the aspect will be draws and an inform Nole.,tennis,cryo7uc,2,t5_2qiq1

4212126,0,t1_cs0d4sk,May surprise you but I would probably play against Fed becauseA. Even though he is still one of the best movers of all time he is at least a half step slower than Nadal and Djoker allowing me to try a funky drop shot and get in an awkward scramble type point if I chose to also better chance at hitting a winner or getting an attackable ball off a big shot.B. The court surface would favor me as a serve and volleyer Kick serve to a one handed backhand on the Ad side as opposed to NovakNadal two handers or at the very least being able to go for and make at least one big shot past him due to the faster surface.The worst thing I could do is try and grind and have legit points with any of these guys. They could just really focus and never miss on top of huge topspin and I wouldnt be able to do anything unless I go for something big early on in the point before they get settled. I never have or will hit with a player even close to their caliber so I really dont know how I would fair in a straight up rally but to give myself the absolute best chance to win a point would be what I mentioned in the first part.   ,tennis,cs0da46,3,t5_2qiq1

Many folks didnt like his earlier lack of sportsmanship of constantly retiring matches early in his career which lead to Andy Roddick calling him out for feigning injury which ultimately lead to that strange US Open where the crowd vigorously booed him during his post match interview.

4585026,0,t3_3dtnss,I think it easy to look at him now and think he hasnt declined because in the areas where he has actually declined you wont spot them exposed in the vast majority of his matches where he plays against scrubs Im talking about st round  th roundquarter final. In most cases the point usually finishes very quickly after his serve which is one area that hasnt declined IMO. On the whole in these matches he doesnt do a great deal of running. So he ends up winning in comfortable straight sets as he has always done. He still constantly reaches semis and finals and you think wow he hasnt declined at all.But when he plays a Djokovic or a Wawrinka someone who will force him to go on the defense thats when his areas of decline are exposed. He cant turn defense into attack as easily as he could and a large amount of that is down to his footspeed but as mentioned his forehand isnt as capable as it once was. I look at the Wimbledon final and it was clear that once he was on the defensive he couldnt quite get himself out of that hole and get back into attack. ,tennis,ct8jjtl,2,t5_2qiq1

I would love to be a confident player that is proud of her body. Women when we grow up weve been judged more our physicality is judged more and it makes us selfconscious.Its true its unclear whether weight training would be advantageous or not but it seems women are avoiding it for reasons that have more to do with being scared of developing muscles which incidentally women do far less readily than men or whether they think weight training is negative for their tennis for other reasons.James Cameron interestingly enough has liked tough women in his films see Terminator  Aliens or Avatar.

Top stringers are around  minutes and worldclass can do it in  minutes though probably not a very good job.  It depends on the person how fast you improve.Heres another recent video My initial concerns were the main strings on the far right or far left.  They are going to have less tension in a way because they only have an string adjacent to them on one side.  The strings in the middle have a string on either side so they feel like they have more tension.  Sometimes I just up the tension a bit on those strings.Also tying off the knots with enough tension is a bit tricky.  Sometimes you tie it off without enough tension and when you release the clamp the tension gets pretty low.   This is more of a problem on the last cross at the bottom of the racquet.  I tend to put the tension a bit higher down there too  lbs to compensate.Also I believe youre supposed to tie one knot securely and pull the other string once that happens see the video on Parnell knots to see what Im talking about.I use this toolIt is expensive but one reason I like it is because the clamp always stays closed so you press to open it then it clamps close when you let go and I use it to pull knots.  Most other tools require you to hold the clamp closed.But with practice you do get better.,tennis,cvln5rp,1,t5_2qiq1

5468397,0,t1_cwaiju2,gt Personally it took me a long time and some coaching to be able to handle pace which is a kind of pressure. What Ive noticed a lot of people doing is handling pace with pace. The guy I played with about  hours ago does it all the time. If I hit hard he tries to match it. And I am NOT a power player. I hit for placement. Especially these days when I dont get to play a lot. He misses most of the time when he tries to match my pace. What I do when a guy hits with a lot of place is try to get it back. Thats my number  priority. Im talking go for a winner extra pace. I abbreviate my swing if I have to and just concentrate on plowing through the ball hitting cleanly taking some pace off ideally hitting it into the more open side of the court. Thats all I do. If I have to Ill pop it up which may get the point back to neutral at best.The biggest thing is I see people trying to outpace pace. On one hand you can say well I have to swing fast just to hit the ball in time. But IMO you really dont. Abbreviate your swing shorten it up big time and just try to get it back. As for a guy who hits everything huge Ive only played  or  people like that in my life. One was in the juniors. Im assuming I played somebody like that in college. Those guys were just better than me. Nothing I could do. But theyre rare the guys who can hit big and hit corners all day. Most guys they hit bigger or heavier than normal I just play my regular game see if they can keep it up. A lot of times they cant. What Im NOT going to do is try to overpower them try to play THEIR game. If anything I might hit softer than usual rush the net more than usual and try to extend the points more than usual. ,tennis,cwan0zi,1,t5_2qiq1

Im obviously not an expert at all but there are several studies on court speeds based on different factors out there.

5587811,0,t3_3rnry0,Well I used to be on the hes a servebot ship especially in  when he had that incredible match against Mahut at Wimbledon. My thought on it was it was an amazing historic match but boy would it have been even more incredible and a amazing if it didnt involve Isner. Say if like Del Po and Djoker had that match or Fed and Nadal. It would have been ridiculously historic and people would enjoy going back to watch highlights because the quality would have been much higher. It wouldnt have even had to have been those big name players it could have been a number of players in the top  at the time and the match in general would have been more interesting because it would have involved more rallies and less servebot points. It was his servebot style however that allowed for a match that ended  in the fifth. I cant picture many others but Isner being involved in a match like that because they just dont have that kind of dominance on serve or that poor of a return game. For that Isner deserves all the applauds he has gotten for that match.Generally though I had avoided watching Isner matches because I found the Servebot style boring. Recently however this year Ive seen more than that from him. Hes improved his return a lot and is hanging in rallies longer. This has put him in his opponents service games more often putting more pressure on them and making him more than a servebot. He also seems to have better match strategy and most of all he seems more confident this year. He really believes he can win out there and that is key. So thats how i think he beat Federer because he believes hes more than just a servebot now he believes that his game is now at a point where he should be giving players like Federer lots of trouble. ,tennis,cwppxjo,3,t5_2qiq1

5746664,0,t1_cx9b1k9,I think this is fairly accurate. If Fed doesnt get a jump start early in the point its fairly difficult for him to turn things around because he needs to be aggresive. Novak can just slug it out and play  shot points every time. I think today was evident. Roger came to the net on a lot of these type of points with three outcomes volley winners missed passing shots from Novak and most importantly a lot of missed volleys into the net by Fed. That last bit has hurt him the most in these rallies today imo.The other problem that Fed needs to address is his RoS on critical points especially second serves. Both Novak and Rafa historically have had a lot of success on nd serve points and thats been his Achilles heel in the US Open final but also in one of the Franch Open finals against Rafa iirc. I simply cant let the other guy get away with a hold of serve when you have BP on a nd serve.,tennis,cx9fh92,0,t5_2qiq1

5836600,0,t1_cxjlbwe,gt Yeah I think those games are just essentially less athletic and less precise versions of what we call tennis today so it would make sense that a better more accurate athlete would dominate.You have to take into account as well that as these games are not as popular so people invest less time into them and even less people can pursue them professionally.Thus the game is going to be less athletic and precise simply because the pro player base does not have as much resources to make it so.Who knows what these games would look like if training was at all on the same level.

I remember when Safin retired and left me heartbroken and basically said he didnt want to play anymore because he was tired of being injured all the time and having to gather his game again and it felt like a never ending cycle. And I cant fault the guy for it. I wonder if anyone remembers that Ferreros drop off was actually pretty ridiculous but it was due to the chicken pox I think. He reached  slam finals and the number  ranking in  and in  he was playing like a hasbeen as a result of being sick and missing time. And unfortunately he never really regained his top level plus the game passed him by.And we know the case with Roddick was similar. I think he could still compete for smaller events but his body was doing him no favors and he also said he was tired of basically playing against his body all the time.But Hewitt never got tired.

6373242,0,t1_czdzznf,Hehe those are excellent points and an interesting analysis!I think you are right about the movement of Dimitrov and the mentality of Nadal. When it comes to Federer and the subconscious need or confidence strategy to believe that he is better than ever? This seems likely as he has always played his own style and believed that his own natural game is good enough to beat anyone. As indeed it was for a while. I get the impression that he has been more adaptive and sensitive to his opponents in the later years trying to change his game for the better. Changed racket coming to the net more often in general changing up his game. For me that implied that he was also realistically reflective about his capabilities but I guess doesnt have to be true? ,tennis,cze2fu8,2,t5_2qiq1

He came into Australia fresh from the off season and still managed to pull something in the Djokovic match. It seems like he can never get a good rhythm of match play under him.Raonic has shown lots of promise so far this year adding the net game and he is doing well when he comes in. Movement is still predictable and still favours that inside out so you can guess most times where he is going. Backhand has gotten better. As with any player with a big serveforehand combo they are always dangerous since they can black out any given day and you cant break them but he seems to be more consistent than an Isner Anderson or Cilic.

6459637,0,t1_czn00js,Also about the series. Grand Slams are considered the big tournaments and the ones people look for. They are the only tournaments apart from the Davis Cup  Nations competing against each other that are a best of  sets. Also the winner gets  points on the rankings.The other events are named after the number of points the winner receives. So ATP  . points for the champion ATP   points and ATP   points.The point distribution means that as the more points are awarded the better players will sign up for the events. All players go for the Slams and s. The  and  gets a little less attention mainly because there are multiple events happening in the same week. Understanding the rankings is a little tricky but not really difficult  it makes sense. The courts are different and some players are better on different surfaces. The top  usually are more well rounded as for the others youll see different names on different tournament surfaces going for the quarters and semi finals.

Clint Eastwood would be the worst paid man in most of his films despite the fact that hes the draw if you go by that standard.Or you know the runner at a tv show often works longer hours than the star should they be on more money?If more people watched women play tennis than men than the longer a males match went on the more expensive it would be for the tournament as theyd have lower audiences for the same expenses. Why then should men be rewarded for working more when that extra work is actually costing the tournament mony?You cant judge entertainment when the aim is to get viewers by the employment standards of labour where the aim is to achieve a goal.The article itself argues that if womens tennis was more popular then mens tennis than woman should be paid more regardless of if they played only  sets to the mens .,tennis,d1gjbhf,15,t5_2qiq1

7625232,0,t3_4jrnxc,I like to watch opposing styles of play for sure. Thats one of the things that made Borg vs. McEnroe Conners vs. McEnroe Sampras vs. Agassi Wilander vs. McEnroe Becker against these guys and early career Fed so damned fun to watch. Thats not even to mention the difference between pure power baseliners vs. more traditional clay style baseliners remember Kafelnikovs run? Or the Sampras clay adapted play style against the likes of Burgera etc. Even watching Guga vs. Nadal last decade at the French let you know Nadal was much more offensive than the Clay courters of the past. Weve certainly lost a lot of variety in the game and while I like watching these matches that exist now theres not nearly as much variety its much more subtle which is fine but I get tired of steak every day and that doesnt mean hey Im sick of tbones lets go to ribeyes. The courts seem much more homogenous these days maybe its the technology maybe its that everyone is training similarly as hybrid powerbaseline players with tons of spin but whether it is it reminds me of what happened to boxing. The heavyweight fights in the past were so great because of the different styles between the likes of Ali Frazier Foreman and others and Tyson also brought something different to the table. Now its just a bunch of very technical  punch bots.

7637570,0,t3_4juz82,Forget who you are playingPlay the ball not the personFocus on one point at a timeGood advice but how do you actually do this?  Its bit like the paradox of trying not to think of a polar bear.One mental trick is to play a game with yourself of trying to see how many points in a row you can win irrespective of the score.  When a streak ends try to start a new one.  This can sometimes help you treat each point with focus and importance but in a detached way.You can also develop rituals or focus on any that you already have.  Nadal is the obvious extreme pro example.  Before every single point he does the same routine goes to the towel fixes his hairheadband adjusts his shorts etc.  This can help to clear your mind before each point.  Of course you need to figure out what works best for you.  ,tennis,d3ackjw,1,t5_2qiq1

Laura Robson has been plagued by injury for years now and has only found her way back on the courts sparsely. The chances she ever reaches the potential many had for her circa  is really slim and none.       Johanna Konta is a great story but similar to Bedene her changes in nationality have left a sour taste in the tennis publics mouth. It didnt help that she bailed on the Fed Cup team earlier this season right before they got trounced by Israel.     Heather Watson is a good looking girl and when shes playing her game shes certainly entertaining. She will definitely receive a fair amount of coverage this grass season. However her ceiling is much lower than the two previously mentioned players. At  years of age she may have already reached her ceiling with a world ranking of .       Compare that to the mens game where Andy is the second ranked player in the world his brother is the first ranked player in doubles Edmund has an incredibly bright future Dan Evans is having an amazing season and theyre fresh off winning the Davis Cup and right in the mix of repeating. ,tennis,d3nk5k6,2,t5_2qiq1

He can waver into dangerously low territory at times and serving to Djokovic is a dicey proposal for the very best. His serve isnt a sure thing like Federer or Karlovic or Raonic which will force tiebreaks. As for clay form Im sorry how many master series titles does Theim have on Clay?

Fed and Nadals down the line backhands just arent as good. They can all go up the line off the forehand well and Nadals inside out lefty forehand is just a beast.

My coach noticed this and told me that to get the feel of accelerating through the ball make only about a  inch backswing then a  foot followthrough. How much does this apply to the forehand? My miss is always long I feel this is because I take the racquet too far back and then decelerate through the impact zone.

As an adult you dont get to play  or  hours a day  or  days a week so those kinds of things are less likely to happen and instead adults read about what the pros and cons of each grip are or see their favorite player using it and try to impose it on their game. I think thats a mistake. I mean if it makes the game more fun and its all about fun then go for it. ,tennis,d61rpd1,1,t5_2qiq1

Majority of tennis pundits and experts agree that Wawrinkas  performance was one of the highest levels of tennis ever seen on the pro circuit. As close to perfection as possible. He made Djokovic look like an amateur that day. Saying he wouldnt take a set off of Nadal or Djokovic had they been at the same level that day is probably the stupidest thing youve ever said to me. Stan would have taken a set off of ANYONE that day. Djokovic wasnt half the player he is now back in that  match and Stan made new Novak look completely silly. Stan would  have beaten the  version with his  performance. Also Nadal lost that very year at the French to Soderling who is an extremely similar player to Wawrinka  Rafa could have easily lost to Wawrinka had Stan played the way he did in the  final.

This kind of follow through which ends by coming around the waist rather than around the shoulder is extremely common on the pro tour. There is some minor risk involved in this motion in that it increases the chances of certain shoulder injuries such as rotatorcuff impingement.

8848522,0,t1_d7bfd3a,I played  years of D tennis  years at  singlesdoubles and was ranked very briefly  the gap between most college players like myself and the top college players is huge and the gap between most top college players except for John Isner and Steve Johnson it seems and top  professional players is also huge.I routinely lost to ranked players because I just lacked the consistency they had. Apart from a few of the guys ranked top  that I played I would say I had a better weapons than most of them did servevolleysforehand although my backhand was below average but most of my problems stemmed from mental toughness. I could start out serving bombs and hold my serve easily for the first few games but all it takes is one break and serving at   in the first set and getting broken seemed to be a common theme for me against a lot of the players that I never beat over my  years.Im honestly not sure what Donald Young is missing. I think hes extremely talented but he seems to be too emotional of a player which is why he usually performs better at the US Open than anywhere else having thousands of people rabidly cheer for you and against your opponent is helpful.For Mackenzie McDonald Im not sure  I havent played him since juniors but have watched him play a little bit during college. He was obviously dominant in juniors and college but Im not sure he has the size or weapons to crack the top  on the pro tour. Probably the same for Noah Rubin  I just played him a few years ago and he tuned me but it was because I couldnt outrun him and couldnt get a ball by him. Pro players wont have that problem. College is just a different game than professional tennis. Any college player that wants to do well has to have a huge weapon that they can take advantage of  for Steve Johnson its his forehand and John Isner its his height serve.,tennis,d7bgt3q,17,t5_2qiq1

8876659,0,t3_51tvul,It depends on your skill level.  If youre an NTRP . I would say you should be able to attack it pretty well.  Pick your weapon use it to direct your opponent off the court and then come in and attack after it.In the context of the video that is basically what happened.Personally speaking it is easier said than done.  I played a guy at a recreational national team tournament that I will reference as Larry the lobber.  It was at Indian Wells same place as the video and they just resurfaced the courts.  Most players were about a .. NTRP at this event.  Usually I could put my overhead away from wherever on the court or at the very least draw a weak ball.  Larry would pop it up moonball without much topspin and reset the point.  Since I am only average height I would try and overhead it.  I didnt put it away and the court kept slowing the ball down just enough he could get to it and pop it up again.  It was annoying as heck.  I ended up losing the match it was a single set noad scoring for this WTT even and Larrys tactics worked great for him.  This was years ago and I think I am much better now at developing a point but in this particular instance it was very effective.,tennis,d7eul1r,2,t5_2qiq1

8967963,0,t3_533vot,Allow me to be a little philosophical    Delpos win in the US Open revealed or confirmed his natural talent and potential. I fully expected him to win many more slams. His game was exciting to watch and I perceived his personality as that of a gentle giant.    His injury robbed the game of some wonderful tennis and reduced the competivness of the game. At the time of the injury I saw Del Potros story as the archtypical story of lost potential. I think regret about what coulda been is something that speaks to all of us. The cruelty of happenstance is something that is experienced by every single one.    And since we are for the most part optimists as opposed to cynical bastards and hence love the idea that sometimes challengesillnessesstruggles can be overcome.

9004183,0,t1_d7u5epu,Im not saying he was returning from Stans position just that he would only really rush the ball when until he was behind in the score.  I remember because I found it so frustrating.  Because of it Roger really should have lost almost  of his matches vs. Nadal.  Im pretty sure I watched their first hardcourt match and Nadal lost it only because he didnt have the confidence to beat Roger yet.The thing is it was always clear to me Rog had the game to counter the tactic.  Rush the ball run around but whatever you do dont just continue to hit backhands each one from further back as Nadal drives you there with his forehand until you have assumed the Gasquet position on both the baseline and the WL column.I wish I could remember the Verdasco match because that one showed it so clearly.  Verdasco was crushing to backhand Roger wold get behind would play aggressive get ahead go back to cruise control get behind repeat.  I was yelling at screen in frustration.Another tactic I thought he should adopt is the fullycommitted runaround that Sampras used to do to keep folks from serving his bh all the time.  Sampras didnt mind occasionally looking like a fool and completely being on wrong position in order to let people know always going to my bh is not riskfree.,tennis,d7u5vgd,1,t5_2qiq1

You might need to do something with rackets as well but I think strings would pretty much do the trick.You see this in other sports there are limits I think in pro golf equipment that casual players are free to ignore . . .Problem is current strings are too grippy and players like Nadal amp Sock could not hit their shots with natural strings I think so it is very hard to do retroactively.,tennis,d8uik5q,-3,t5_2qiq1

One thing I think you need to care about though is that after any serve try to understand what happened and fix anything you feel went wrong. Think this is where a lot of people go wrong. They pick a bucket serve  and call it a day without really thinking about what is going on. In one hour I usually do around  serves sometimes a bit more if they are coming out great but after each serve I see if the ball went where I wanted with the spin I wanted and if not try to understand why not did I rotate my wrist enough to hit flatter? was the toss in the right place for me to extend properly? etcThis last summer I did this twice a week and made my serve from just about average to bringing me a few aces in each set or very weak replies even on nd serves. Even my coach sometimes has difficulty returning my st serve to the body and it was only in the span of a couple months but using this structured approach.ps this only works if you know in general how to serve if you are still at the pop the ball over the net serve a coach maybe best,tennis,d90evht,1,t5_2qiq1

It is a private professional sports organisation trying to maximise future profits and marketability a very big part of their job. Why would they just accept its going to suck for a while?!And I dont see the relevance of the undeniable fact that there is a generation between the current top players and the current next gen which will probably win a slam before the next gen does.

10125938,0,t3_5kxn81,First of all I dont think there is anything controversial about this at all. This is hugely dependent on the era of the tennis being played. We place a huge importance on slams at the moment but in the ss people placed more importance on being ranked number . When determining the best player it should be more than total slam count longevity dominance competition surface amp play diversity consistency are all huge factors. gt Whoever starts winning multiple slams after Djokovic and Murray go away will most likely not be a better player than Andy murray was.However it is hard to truly state that as fact. Which is again why it is tough to compare across eras. ,tennis,dbrezl7,5,t5_2qiq1

Whenever the ball is slightly short and its at say waist height I tend to put my left foot ahead am a right hander and talking about my forehand and take the ball on the front foot while leaning into the shot. Somehow at waist height or below I struggle to generate any forward power with my swing and its more a transverse contact with the ball to such an extent that it fails to cross the net. Im able to generate great forward power while leaning into the shot and taking it on the front foot. The problem is inertia makes me takes a step and a half forward into the court and I lose out on necessary recovery time backpaddling before my next shot. So my doubt is how to maintain an open stance and shift weight into the shot when the ball is at or below waist height?,tennis,dc8gu8m,1,t5_2qiq1

10311580,0,t3_5nmpw3,Australian Open  preview  Mens SinglesMurray hoping to win his first Australian Open title World No.  Andy Murray will be the th male player and the first from Great Britain to be seeded first at a Grand Slam.

Ivan Lendl guided Murray to all three of his Grand Slam victories and both of his Olympic gold medals.Djokovic aiming for record seventh title Defending champion Novak Djokovic hopes to become the first player to win the Australian Open for a seventh time. He now shares the record of six with Roy Emerson . In the Open Era three male players won at least seven titles at a single Grand Slam Rafael Nadal won the French Open nine times and both Pete Sampras and Roger Federer won Wimbledon on seven occasions. Djokovic could win his th Grand Slam title which would see him surpass Emerson  for fourth place alltime among men behind Federer  Sampras and Nadal both . Djokovic has reached  Grand Slam finals secondmost alltime among men behind Federer . Djokovic has reached the final in  of the last  Grand Slams he has participated in. Djokovic has reached  Grand Slam semifinals equalmost to Jimmy Connors. Only Federer  has reached more among men.

Djokovic has reached the final in seven of the last eight Grand Slams with the exception being Wimbledon . He lost two of the seven finals in that time span both to Wawrinka. Djokovic  is five wins shy from equalling Connors  in second place on the alltime list of male players with most Grand Slam singles match wins. Federer leads with  victories. Djokovic can only reclaim the mens No.  position if he wins the Australian Open AND if Murray does not reach the semifinals.Wawrinka for backtoback Grand Slam victories Stan Wawrinka has won each of his three Grand Slams finals he has played so far the  Australian Open the  French Open and the  US Open. Wawrinka is one of two players in the Open Era to have reached three or more finals without losing one alongside Gustavo Kuerten also . Wawrinka could win a Grand Slam title for the fourth consecutive calendar year. Only Novak Djokovic has a longer running streak as he won at least one Major in the past six seasons . Since the beginning of  Wawrinka  has won more Grand Slam titles than Roger Federer Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray combined .Federer and Nadal not among Top  seeds Roger Federer will be seeded th on the mens side his lowest seed ever at a Grand Slam. The last time the Swiss was unseeded was at the  French Open the last Grand Slam with only  seeds now  where he lost to Alex Corretja in the quarterfinals. This will be the first time since the Grand Slam debut of Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in  where both Federer and Nadal are not among the Top  seeds of a Grand Slam. Federer is hoping to become the second man to win a Grand Slam in the Open Era aged  years or older. Ken Rosewall won the US Open  and Australian Open   after turning . Federer won his first of  Grand Slam titles more than  years ago at Wimbledon in . The mens Open Era record span of most years between first and last Grand Slam victory currently belongs to Pete Sampras  years and  days  US Open   US Open.

Rafael Nadal is aiming to win his th Grand Slam title in order to surpass Sampras in second place on the mens alltime list. Nadal is eyeing his second Australian Open title after triumphing in . If so he will have won each Grand Slam at least twice a feat no man has achieved in the Open Era. Last year Nadal was ousted in the first round by Fernando Verdasco. The last man to win the Australian Open after losing in the first round the year before was Petr Korda in .Comebacks and breakthroughs The only nonEuropean winner in the last  Grand Slams  Wimbledon US Open is Juan Martin Del Potro as he won the  US Open. In the  Grand Slams before this streak the minority  was won by players from Europe. Del Potro will not be playing in the Australian Open this year. Kei Nishikori and Andy Murray were the only male players that reached the second week at each of the four Grand Slams last year. Last year four players born in the s reached the quarterfinals at one of the four Grand Slams  Milos Raonic Dominic Thiem David Goffin and Lucas Pouille. Raonic became the first male player born in the s to reach a Grand Slam final as he finished as runnerup to Murray at Wimbledon in . No man born in the s has won a Grand Slam yet.

10395443,0,t3_5out24,Back in  I was covering the SAP Open in San Jose for a now nonexistent tennis website. I got to see Istomin beat Querrey Roddick and Benneteau to lose to Raonic in the final. I got to ask him questions in the interviews after his matches. Particularly in the early rounds there wasnt a lot of press for Istomin beating Michael Russell in the afternoon.He seemed like a really great guy. Funny humble and excited to be doing so well that week. He struck me as a hard worker and a bit more of a real person in his interactions with the press than a lot of the other players Ive interacted with and Ive been a fan of his ever since. I know his career has been really up and down but I was pumped for him when he finally won his first title in Nottingham in . Ive always thought he had a higher potential than hes been able to reach consistently during his career so I am thrilled to see him get this huge win which will probably get him more attention than hes ever had in his twelve years on tour.He deserves it. Way to go Denis.,tennis,dcme1qv,25,t5_2qiq1
10395773,0,t3_5ovget, Istomin is the first wildcard player to eliminate the defending champion in any of the four Grand Slams. This is Istomins first victory against a member of the Big Four. His record against them is now . It is also the first time that Istomin managed to win a set against Djokovic at the Australian Open. This is the first time that Djokovic has lost to a player ranked outside the Top  in a Grand Slam match. Istomin is ranked . Djokovic is now  against nonTop  players at Grand Slams. The last time that the defending Australian Opens mens champion lost before the third round was in  where Boris Becker was knocked out in the first round by Carlos Moya. It is Djokovics earliest Grand Slam exit since Wimbledon  where he was ousted in the second round by Safin. This is Djokovics first set loss since he lost to Wawrinka in the  Australian Open. Djokovic has never won the Australian Open whenever he has had to face Istomin   and . The last time that a Top  seed lost in the second round or earlier at a Grand Slam was at the  Wimbledon where Nadal lost to Rosol. This is Djokovics first defeat against a player from Asia excluding Nishikori since he lost to Takao Suzuki on the Challenger tour in Helsinki in .EDIT This is the fourth time in the Open Era that a wildcard player has beaten one of the Top  seeded players in a Grand Slam Pat Cash beat Wilander  at Wimbledon  James Blake defeated Nadal  at the  US Open and Kyrgios ousted Nadal  at Wimbledon .,tennis,dcmfe57,23,t5_2qiq1

Its just so hard to believe that a player of his caliber has suddenly developed what frankly sounds like the behaviour of a less committed player such as Kyrgios.And clearly hes frustrated in himself so I dont see why he wouldnt seek to rectify what is apparently a simple issue that hes somehow allowed to creep into his game. Its quite weird...Djokovic made some silly errors in this match sure but it doesnt seem fair to put Istomins performance down he was playing a mighty angular game and staying with his man in some enduring rallies. he also served well and held his nerve at the right times  all qualities you see in much higher level players.

10660227,0,t1_ddfdpa5,Yeah I get that viewpoint and no player should be making excuses about physical condition. But I also say that you dont really fully believe that. If youre a big Lopez fan you want him to beat real Djokovic not oneeyed Djokovic. The fact that he took that first set is considerably less sweeter since we know Djokovic was compromised. I think there is a difference between dinged up as usual and massive blisters that make playing well impossible but I realize that really defining the difference and applying it to every match is impossible. Really my ultimate point is theres a difference between Novaks thrashings of Nadal in  and Ferreros win in . Novaks wins seem a hell of a lot more impressive and my guess is that most would agree with me.

Part of that I think is that Im glad Roger won although it came at the expense of Rafa this time which is bittersweet.  But another part of that is that anyone who watched the match knows it really was very close but Rafa looked a lot more like the Rafa of old rather than the Rafa of the last two years than he has in a long time.  He looked tired to me but he also looked like he believed in what he was doing.  Im surprised he talked about anxiety so openly in the interview but at the same time anyone watching him I think already knew that he had lost his confidence and for lack of better description looked stressed out.  At the AO I saw Rafa fighting tooth and nail against every break point the way he used to do pulling off victories even after match point or close to it saving  BPs in a row to win a game that anyone else wouldve lost.  Its a little depressing that he lost after leading in the final set but it felt like to me anyway as an observerfan he has that gritty joy back.,tennis,ddis502,15,t5_2qiq1

As a side note there is no such thing as bad reaction times at least in the context that such a statement can only be used as an excuse.  Pure reaction timing is irrelevant to good volleys. The reason? Because  you are anticipating where the volley is going to be and predicting based on what information you have. If you rely on reacting to the volley you are on thin ice and have a low margin of error. Volleys are truly about setting yourself early anticipation and good technique. You focus on these factors I promise youll be an awesome volleyer. Send me a PM if you ever get that video going! Ill be happy to provide my observations.,tennis,decf7e1,2,t5_2qiq1

When I move indoors for the winter I tend to contact everything about  inches below my normal hitting zone until I adapt to the speed and bounces.

11268674,1,t3_60t969,Being a big Federer fan and while knowing that the ATP and the WTA cannot be compared directly the point being made there has some validity.I dont think there is any doubt that Serenas pure dominance over her biggest rivals easily surpasses that of Feds over his. Feds two biggest glaring weaknesses are Nadal and Djokovic and this simply cannot be overlooked. While I am excited at what  brings and the possibility that Fed might finally beat Djokovic at Wimby andor USO clarification Yes Fed has beaten Djokovic before at both but not lately...like since  he currently sports a  record against those  at the slams. Thats a huge edge by his top two rivals. Heck Fed has lost  straight years to Djokovic one walkover even at the WTF.Truth be told since  Fed has been the rd best player for the last  years. Djokovic is head and shoulders above both him and Nadal and Nadal is comfortably ahead of him.Of course no one can deny Feds dominant peak from  which is what still keeps him in the conversation.

11706064,0,t1_dgmuuol,I dont want to turn this into a hostile discussion but I hope I can change your mind on this.We cant say that the comment had no real malignant intent. This argument has been made time and time again in tennis like in the Wozniacki bra and skirtstuffing incident But Swedes cant be racist! and Lleyton Hewitts Look at him! comment in his match against Blake.I completely disagree with you on the idea that this makes this comment excusable in any form because it was offhand or offmic. Theres a reason why people especially women refuse to let go of Trumps offhand grabthepussy comment because it points out a larger societal attitude that is most importantly kept hidden behind a door and repeatedly dismissed as innocuous when its ugly head pokes out.I cant understand why people think things are only racist when it involves some kind of vulgar form of discrimination e.g. James Blake getting tackled by some cops in NYC despite wearing a bright blue polo shirt. Yeah cops a burglar totally wants to stick out like that. The double standard here is that whiteness is almost always considered a nonidentity so you almost never hear jokes about babies of white players being called out as milk. For some reason with players like Serena theres always some kind of controversy of pundits or players doing or saying some stupid shit about her  how many times are we just gonna laugh it off and say that its a harmless incident before we realize that harmless or not its the fact that we still see Serena as a racialized body that we dont do for the likes of players like Sharapova?Until I hear Natase saying that comment directly towards Serenas face there is no indication that this was meant to be a friendly joke.

11761420,0,t3_67rwdz,i personally have no issues with her coming back to play. Like you have mentioned she served the entirety of her ban and has all the rights to be playing again. However i seriously dont agree with the wildcards. it isnt entirely the tournaments fault for giving her the wildcards because she applied for the wildcards too so in a way she thinks she deserved those wildcards over the other players. This aspect is particularly troubling to me because it sends a wrong message out to so many people out there  go ahead and cheat we will still welcome you back with open armsAlso on Maria as a player it doesnt come off to me that shes apologetic for doping but rather shes just sorry that she got caught. There are so many clear cut signs that she made attempts to cover up the fact that she took a performanceenhancing drug not disclosing to her own team  thats nail in the coffin for me. I guess Ill never see her as a legit player ever again. ,tennis,dgt6q31,2,t5_2qiq1

11778008,0,t1_dgux7pd,I bet you are not spanish and we all know his english is not very good i doubt any spanish speaker would call Nadal nonhumble.  I remember after RG  or  I was with a guy from Menorca who told me that Rafa was getting a Pc for Christmas. He was already a milliomaire but he had to ask for a laptop hus job was to play and never thought aboit money or fame at least by that time. He has been raised like that. In that interview you quoted he used bad English he meant I never take a result for granted before I play so... but hey just think what you want of course. ,tennis,dgv2p4g,3,t5_2qiq1
11778694,0,t1_dgv56vt,Commentators on TennisTV were actually saying that the academy in Barcelona that he attended when he was about  named one of their courts after him when he went back to visit earlier this week.

11791244,0,t3_688ct0,Very very intriguing semifinals in Stuttgart today! Im pretty up in the air on who will win the SF!!!Mladenovic vs Sharapova  Maria won their only meeting on grass at Wimby in . With the way Mladenovic has been playing so far this season plus the confidence of beating Kerber I think this will be a good match. It will defini be Sharapovas first real test.Halep vs Siegemund  Laura Siegemund has won their only previous meeting which was at Stuttgart just last year! With wins over Venus in Charleston and Karolina Pliskova here in Stuttgart Siegemund is playing some fine tennis on the clay.  Simmons has been looking very well and playing like her old self.EDIT Simona not Simmons. ,tennis,dgwksga,3,t5_2qiq1
