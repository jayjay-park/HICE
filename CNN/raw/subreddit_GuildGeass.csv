8956586,0,t3_4war1m,Age NationalitySwedishPrevious raiding experience Been raiding on and off since the End of TBC at that time just doing pugs because of my young age. At the release of Cataclysm my journey in raiding began for real. Doing only TOFWBOTBWD normal but still during current content. Cant remember the name of the guilds I raided with at that time since it was a long time ago. At The release of Firelands shit got real and the taste for hard core raiding was put in my mouth for the first time. I started raiding with a guild called pure brutality as a holy paladin which I had played since I started playing wow. We cleared hc later to claim the sweet hc but after current content. Dragon soul was cleared in the first  weeks of normal. And HC took a while to down because i had to priority my edjucation. link to my pov of baleroc heroic  MOP was a bit of a bummer I didnt feel like it was fun to raid during that time so I only did MSV Normal Ahead of the curve later to quit the game to come back during The lovley time of SoO cant say that with a straight face P Still raiding as a holy paladin i took Ahead of the curve heroic twice At the end of Panda expansion I decided to re roll because my current guild lacked a tank for WOD. The expansion started a little slowly Cleared Highmaul HC  because of my guild not having dedicated players. On the other hand I manage to do all challenge mode dungeons on gold with the last downed on  and took a sweet rank  in the world on Grimrail Depot Gold. After that I switched server to Twisting neather from Shattered hand. Where I joined a guild called GoO mainly consisting of danish irls.  I took a rank  world in Dmg on butcher as a blood dk  even though that was on normal run and just for shits and giggle Its pretty good anyway P I only cleared  mythic in Highmaul and quit wow  week before the release of BRF beacuse of school once more. I didnt come back to wow untill late WOD only to do some bosses on normal and in the very last weeks getting my moose mount. But now as legion has come out and raids are about to begin Im back to kick some ass and take names.Previous main roles and classes HealerHoly paladin Tank Blood DK.What role and class will you be applying as?
