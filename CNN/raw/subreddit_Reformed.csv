242435,0,t1_cf5trse,gtGod and yes God could have created Adam differently. Do you think God could?God could have given in different preferences but in doing so he would have violated Adams free will. gtDo you think that Adam wasnt depraved in some way? Do you think that an undepraved person rebels against the Almighty God?I think that God did not create Adam with a sinful will. I think Adam was posse non peccare able not  to sin. I think that is essential for a biblical understanding of the fall. Man could have not sinned. Adam could have not rebelled against God that is why he and by extension all man kind can be held responsible. If Adam had to sin I dont see how he can be held responsible.gtMolinism is deterministic. Not only has God determined the end but He has also determined the means. If God actualized this world a millions times could Adam have made a different choice? How about if God actualized this world a trillion trillion times? No. I dont think you understand how counterfactuals work. Molinism says that there are true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. These are statements in the form of if P were in C P would freely choose A where P is some person C is some situation and A is some action.God knows the the truth value of these propositions. But most importantly these statements get there truth value before God decides to create at all. God does not decide what these truth values will be. God does not cause the people to have these counterfactuals. They could have gone differently.That is what determinism is about the fact that in no possible world could you have done otherwise. Molinism is not deterministic in that sense.What you mean by determinism is that God foreordained all that will come to pass. To that I say amen! But the means are what is important here.gtIn this world Adam could not have chosen differently. In another world he may have chosen differently but as long as God chose to actualize this world Adam did not have the ability to choose otherwise.If Adam had chosen differently it would have been a different world because worlds are maximal states of affairs. So yes it is analytically true in that sense that a world containing Adam freely choosing to sin cannot be a world where Adam did not freely choose to sin. But given the world God chose to create the actual world nothing constrained Adam from choosing not to sin. It was a choice that was completely open to Adam. God did not fix Adams choice in any way. God did not give Adam a will such that he for sure would choose to sin. Adam was able not to sin. To me that is important. Adam could have refrained. That is why he is to be blamed for not.,Reformed,cf5vphc,1,t5_2riuy
242475,0,t1_cf5tnsy,gtI think this is where we can see that your definition of freedom is false. It seems that you are defining freedom in a way that transcends God when in reality God is the foundation for what it means to be free.I am not defining freedom as something that transcends God. Just as I can say God cannot do the logically incoherent without putting logic above God I can say God is not free to do the logically incoherent lie when he is a perfect being without putting freedom above God.gtIt isnt that God is not free to lie. It is that God is free to not lie.Of course he is free to not lie. But he is also not free to lie. That does not make God inferior in some way.gtHe is the epitome of what it means to be free.Yes he is. He has an infinite array of alternative possibilities in front of him.gtHe is free to make decisions that accord with His nature. He is the epitome of what it means to be free. You are free to make decisions according to your nature. I am free to make decisions according to my nature. A sinner is free to make choices according to his nature.If thats all it means to be free than how is God the epitome of free? We are all forced to be free in your scenario. Everyone one of us always and only chooses what we prefer just like God does. I dont see God as being more free than us here.But on my conception of free God is clearly superior in terms of his freedom. I am not free to have made the world differently but God certainly is.gtWe need to ground our definitions biblically and your definition of freedom is not based in the bible. Give me some verses where the bible defines freedom. My idea that God is more free than us because he is more powerful more loving more knowledgeable and can thus do more than us is not ever stated in explicitly in the bible. But I dont think it is an unbiblical notion.gtIf there is a situation where God is limited in a good way by His nature then it follows that you can be limited by your nature and still be free.Of course. I never said there wasnt. I cannot create a world because I am limited by my nature. That is a possibility I do not have. But yet I am free. I never rejected that. ,Reformed,cf5vuu9,1,t5_2riuy
244444,0,t1_cf628x2,gt Are you honestly putting the preferences on the same level as God? Are you saying that the preferences of human wills are ontologically necessary and not contingent of God? I didnt mention that because I thought it was obviousNo. I was giving a counter example to your statement. So what you mean is that all contingent statements are not true unless God decrees them?gtThank you. This is the entire point. You are holding to a definition that is logically incoherent with your position. You yourself said that everything is determined. Therefore things cannot be free in a libertarian sense.No I didnt. I never ever ever ever said that everything is determined. I said that everything is foreordained. Those are very different man.gtThis is a novel way of defining determined that is unique to Molinism. Determinism means that all events have been determined. Use the word to define the word. Thanks. How about we look here or here The normal definition of determinism is not from molinist. In fact here is an article on compatiblism from the Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy that defines determinism differently than you are.gtEverything that happens in this world is going to happen because God chose it to happen. No what world is actual will depend on Gods choice but since he weakly actualized it any choice of a free creature happens because they chose it.gtIn Molinism He could have created a different world where different things happened but He determine to create this world and all the free choices entailed over a different world with other free choices.Yes absolutely. God chose which world to actualize. You are right. Thus he chose which circumstances I will be in. But I am still the reason why I act the way I act in those given circumstances.gtWho made the decision which free choices were made? God did. No. I made the decisions which choice I make in any circumstance. God chose what circumstances will be actual. There is a big difference there.gtThe idea is that we are living revelatory. We are taking our definitions from what God has revealed. We know that God is perfectly free and that He acts according to His preferencesnature. God of course does whatever he pleases. But can you give me in the bible where it says God is free and defines what freedom there means?gtYou are adding something to the definition of freedom and you need evidence that your amended definition is true. You took something away from the definition of freedom. The ability to do otherwise. Why is that not important? Do you agree that the bible does not define the word freedom? Then how can you privilege yours above mine?gtWhat is your evidence that your definition is true and the compatibilists isnt?Here is a scenario where I think it is clear we arent free but we are always choosing according to what we prefer.Suppose a mad scientist from alpha centuri implants a device in my brain that makes me always and only prefer to eat spinach instead of ice cream. So when certain brain waves trigger in my head that are leading up to me preferring ice cream they are interrupted and replaced with a signal that causes me to want spinach. So I do exactly and only what I prefer to do eat spinach. Yet it is clear to me that I am not free here. For me I am convinced that if God caused Adam to have a sinful will God could not have called his creation of man very good because a sinful will even if not totally depraved is not very good.,Reformed,cf637jm,1,t5_2riuy

Where YEC sees the problem is when the theology of original sin and death from Adam is compromised within evolutionary views. It seems that many people who accept even theistic evolution end up denying the historical accounts of the creation and the flood. Then all sorts of other problems enter in because Paul and even Christ believed these were real events accurately recorded in Genesis.

I believe if properly done it could ultimately focus our attention on the gospel itself more if we recognize some views as adiaphora physical Adam denial notwithstanding at least in my view.As an example I led a class at my local church some time ago about the Gospel seeking to clarify it such that we really understood it and would then be able to communicate it more and do so more efficiently.  In the course of the discussions one member brought up the need to convert folks to Christ and to  dayYEC.  Thus the Creation issue was indeed conflated with the gospel by this church member.  He saw it as the stumbling stone to belief more so than Christ.  In discussing that he was relieved that one need not hold to dayYEC to be a believer.

414822,0,t1_cfnqapd,gtThe PCA writes The committee also affirms that we view NPP and FV proponents in the PCA as brothers in Christ. Thus we take their published statements and writings seriously. We have worked hard to be fair and accurate in our study of their writings and in the statement of the issues they raise.Therefore the general PCA and many other Reformed denominations do not view FV as a Gospel heresy. The problem is that mods often use NAPARC to reject FV but then when someone brings up the fact that the majority of NAPARC also rejects credobaptism and continuationism then the mods say those views are still allowed because they arent gospel issues. But NAPARC never officially calls FV a gospel issue Id dare say that a lot of presbyteries in NAPARC would consider exclusive credobaptism to be a bigger problem in their churches than FV.Lets cut to the chase here rReformed s position on FV has little to do with NAPARC. It has more to do with the mods personal rejections of FV.

My main issue is that the people who worked hard to fight antinomianism and defend Theonomy were not the people who ended up getting to define the word Theonomy. Now Theonomy has become a term to describe someone who says we must follow the OT case law literally. Put fences around your roof folks.R.J. Rushdoony the father of Theonomy IMO would not have said modern laws should be written literally as OT law was. He would say that OT case law was a fleshing out of the ten commandments and that our civil laws should be a fleshing out of the  commandments as well. In my opinion thats what Theonomy is and thats what makes me a Theonomist. So in my book someone who says that civil laws need not adhere to the  commandments is antinomian. And someone who says that God gave us the whole Bible but specifically the  commandments and the case laws so that we can understand how the Gods law should be applied in ALL of society this person is a Theonomist.,Reformed,cg03b8y,2,t5_2riuy

I know that if I ever corrected one of them in a Biblical manner they would be calm and gracious and repentant. Something that I think some people forget about a healthy church government is the comfort that such an institution brings to the congregation. I dont ever have to feel like Im walking on eggshells around leaders I can be open and honest with them about my own sin and failings without worrying that they are going to condemn me or push me away. I can encourage and call them out as appropriate without worrying that I am going to face backlash. We can all exchange ideas and debate in a way that is friendly edifying and doesnt leave people with hurt feelings. I know that unrepentant wolves and false prophets arent going to be tolerated in the congregation. The strong Biblical leadership and church government breeds that sort of confidence. The time we would have spent bickering and mending hurt feelings can be used to spread the gospel in our city instead. A healthy church with a healthy church government is absolutely paramount.

1041107,0,t1_chmkoe9,Dude nobody is going to downvote you for having a mature debate with another Christian. I am certainly not. Look at my profile. I have like  Karma because for the first year of being on Reddit I debated Atheists in rathiesm. Boy was it fun!It was fun because Atheists would get so angry. My Karma is an attribute of this. If you are going to debate the pagan demographic then yes you will be down voted. An excellent example of this is Jesus. Jesus never shied away from having a public debate with the Pharisees and Sadducees. He kicked ass at it and won every time. And they hated Him for it because it was rocking their world. They first began by challenging Him openly and publicly. Jesus obliged them and dumbfounded everybody with his answers. They eventually resorted to trickery and when that failed they executed Him on the Cross. This is just reality of the Christian life when dealing with worldlypeople. However when debating with another brother in Christ then this is not the case.We have the opportunity to come together as like mindedin that we are both regenerate individuals and not fear each other. But to come together with joy and happiness in Christ our Lord. Yes there are many things that we do not agree on. This is all a part of Gods redemptive plan. Not everybody will be in the same place on the path of Righteousness. And that is okay we should not shy away because of this. I am not badgering you because I think I can change you. No this is not my job but the job of the Holy Spirit. But I like to have these discussions to be an encouragement in you. And to myself. For if a pagan receives the Word with hatefor it is the law that will judge them then a true Christian can receive it with love having no reason to hate and be scared. I have the discussions to plant a seed of understanding in the heart of other Christians so that maybe if I have spoken righteousness it will come into fruition in the Christians heart by the work of the Holy Spirit. I receive these seeds just as willingly as I give them. There is no other way of lifting up another Christian! Are we suppose to congratulate each other on our Righteousness and Unrighteousness? God forbid that I delve into this form of vanity and selfrighteousness. So I ask you do not be afraid of a public debate. We are not your enemy. I hope  However it is the Enemies plan to turn one against another. With Godly wisdom and righteousness we must see this perversion and trust in the Lord for we are all brothers Him.Edit  I have another account that has  Karma. This one does not.,Reformed,chmmmmu,1,t5_2riuy

2756816,0,t1_cnha8is,Perhaps I should have said recognized instead of defined the canon.I believe that the church correctly recognized the divinely inspired works that God intended for us to have.  They were  accurate.  Didnt include anything extra or leave out anything.  I believe they used many helpful objective criteria to do so and were guided by the Holy Spirit and got it absolutely right. If I just stopped there I think wed be in full agreement.  But how fun would that be?   I just want to point out three things.  I didnt recognizeidentifydefine the canon for myself.  I received it as a tradition..  Because the Holy Spirit guided the process of canonization and only because of that then at least that tradition must be authoritative.  I have no right to add or remove a book..  In their divinely superintended process of recognizing the canon the fathers explicitly considered tradition.  Who wrote it?  Was it widely and historically received?  Did it fit with the other things the church taught?  All of these are arguments from tradition.Its a good thing for guys like me that we have tradition to guide us otherwise theres no telling what heresies Id fall prey to.  I could totally imagine myself as a modalist or an adoptionist or a Eutychian or a preterist or a universalist or even shudder an Arminian.

3094291,0,t3_2vk0kx,You a proponent of RK theology?A couple of problems I noticed with this paper. First The author makes the claim that They believed that marriage was not a religious ceremony but a civil contract. Yet it seems that there is  no evidence throughout the paper to back up this claim not even a source for us to go. The paper just moves on to the next tidbit of info. So it makes the reader scratch his head. A claim like that is weighty enough to fuel a several page essay provided reliable sources back up the claim.So that leads me to the second problem where are the sources? There are sources right under the charts of statistics which is good but those sources deal strictly with demographics and statistics. What about all of the other facts? Where did the author get the idea of courting sticks or precontract? Did it come from John Owen as a primary source or George Marsden as a secondary? For all the reader knows the author is just making things up which only adds further discredit to the claim in the post title.The title just piqued my interest because a claim like that seems very unPuritan like especially considering the Act of Uniformity in  a major event to catalyst their formation and distaste for the secular government though it is difficult to call the government at that time secular but you get the idea.My point is I do not take this paper as very scholarly so I do not buy into the claim. Just because it is stated in a paper that is under a .edu url does not mean that it is legitimate. And also in case the author is historically correct in his claim just because the Puritans believed something one way does not mean that they are the authority that we ought to follow.,Reformed,coipzz3,5,t5_2riuy

3413414,0,t1_cphbplg,Sure. Its pretty easy.First off well start with how to interpret the text. For this particular mode of understanding just a simple literallogical method works.Whats the primary focus of the Gospel of John? It would be the work and role of Christ in regards to teaching and bringing forth the new covenant. We have the Third creation story at the beginning describing how God brings forth creation which would be through his son. Next we have a progressive revelation of what is to come and who Christ is through miracles the nature of salvation and so on and so forth pretty much everything that is related to the new covenant administration that will happen. Coming to John  we find yet another aspect of the new covenant set to happen. Now to understand the primary understanding of the passage we must first try to look at the primary definitions of the words.gt I am the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser.Its setting up the metaphor and most importantly is talking about the different roles of the trinity in respect to each other the only way we really can differentiate them. Second it points to the Father committing to do a particular task. What is it? lets see.gtEvery branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes that it may bear more fruit. He sanctifies through trials or.... Takes away the Branches??? We already know that branches or vines are us. We already know that the lord has sealed us for eternity.gtalready you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.So Someone hes talking to is clean in direct relation to what this passage is talking about. By simply just reading the chapter before we know that hes talking to the disciples.gtAbide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me. The only way to have fruit is to have faith or abide.gtI am the vine you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me you can do nothing.We are branches bro. The ones that if they dont bare fruit which are taken away by God the Father.gtIf anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers and the branches are gathered thrown into the fire and burned.So in order to even be thrown away according to the context of this passage perserverance is false or the new covenant doesnt only have believers. Perserverance is true therefore the new covenant doesnt only have believers.This is one of the things that I felt convicted about.,Reformed,cphcr5r,2,t5_2riuy

Not only those that do actually profess faith in and obedience unto Christ but also the infants of one or both believing parents are to be baptized.gtV. Although it is a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance yet grace and salvation are not so inseparably annexed unto it as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it or that all that are baptized are undoubtedly regenerated.  The Westminster Confession of Faith Ch. XXVIII Art. IV V  While Article V is not referring to Article IV in particular but the ordinance of Baptism in general I believe it includes Article IV in its assessment.gtFor that reason we detest the error of the Anabaptists who are not content with a single baptism once received and also condemn the baptism of the children of believers. We believe our children ought to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant as little children were circumcised in Israel on the basis of the same promises made to our children.The Belgic Confession Art. That pretty well covers both major paedobaptist Confessional Reformed branches. Now on an individual basis I dont think most paedobaptists believe credobaptists are engaging in willful sin when they withhold the sacrament from their children. However our standards of doctrine do call the neglect sinful.,Reformed,cppft86,2,t5_2riuy

But most businesses are small and are only incorporated to protect against lawsuits.  I am a Christian and Im selling product Y.  Sinner needs my person to come and actively participate at their event of sin and provide product Y.  I refuse to provide product Y because I am a Christian and do not want to participate in their event.The difference is in the act of compelling someones person to attend a homosexual wedding.  And if you cant see a difference between compelling someone against their will to attend and participate in what they consider a sin then I wont get through to you.Anyways in your example of selling a coffee to an idolator to compare oranges to oranges here the idolator would need to be asking you to come to his idolator meeting and serve them coffee there while they all actively participate in some form of idolatry.  Also to compare oranges to oranges your example of selling food to a fat person would need to be different e.g. you are compelled to go to the fat persons house and cook him the macaroni and cheese and serve him Doritos.  In conclusion Im glad you identify with the homosexuals as a sinner and are worried about their well being.  But homosexuality is listed numerous times in the OT and NT as being a sin.  It does not say selling fat people food or selling idolators coffee.  And if you really believe that logic equation of yours up there then you would have to also believe that if your are a Christian then you would have to participate in all sins if someone asked you.

4558937,0,t1_ct59aaf,Were talking crosspurposes from different definitions here. I was basing my point upon the prelaw approach to marriage taken in the OT and the lack of a religious ceremony re marriage in the Law the laws are about postmarital justice or provision for victims. I think we share different ideas of what the laws being fulfilled looks like and I would more emphasise us being grafted into the vine that some from Israel are part of and that some arent and so have a slightly different hermeneutic W.R.T what the continuation of the covenant of grace a la Abraham and fulfillment of the law looks like.The obfuscation in the Law is why I am unwilling to comment too far on that as many previously nonreligious practices and customs became religious in the sense that you are saying as a result of Israel being a Theocracy and having no understanding of a difference between civil and religious law. As under the New Covenant we are called to be under our civil governments this lack of demarcation makes it difficult to work out from the presence of something in the Law whether the church or civil institutions should be doing it e.g. murder theft punishment. This is why I prefer to look at prelaw biblical marriages to work out roughly how and by whom marriage was administered.To be clear I am not arguing that marriage should have anything to do with the government but that it should also have nothing administratively to do with the Church.,Reformed,ct59t29,1,t5_2riuy

If you try to reform the false teachings of a church youll either get sucked in to the false teachings yourself or alienate and drive away the people who refuse to believe anything else.  Plus a new person coming into a church is going to be staring down Everest in terms of trying to drive any change if the leadership is already not following the bible.  Assuming you can hold to the truth youll basically end up creating a new church anyway so why not just start from scratch?

There are couples that agonize they simply cant have one. But the flipside of that is many of those do choose adoption.Adoption is a grand thing. We have never felt called as it were to adoption. I often wonder those who can have and do already have children of their own what the motivation is to adopt and stop having their own children.Weve been in situations a few times where we were ready if my wifes sister didnt follow through on her responsibilities that we might adopt our niece.

4873755,0,t3_3hnbc4,From an old post I did on Fuller and Piper in keeping with my theme of besmirching your posts by attacking the author.  Hahaha.This Desiring God conference message and others show a strong endorsement of Fullers aberrant views on Justification not to mention the actual lecture given by Fuller right after at the conference. The problem is that Fullers covenant theology leads him to argue things like that Romans  is saying that what the Jews got wrong was not that they sought righteousness through works but that they did not seek to be righteous by the law by faith.  According to Fuller the folly of the Jews is that they should have kept the law out of faith for righteousness.  He will not allow the Lutheran partition between law principle and faith principle. He begins quickly to sound very much like N.T. Wright with his justified in the end by the whole life lived stuff.But Piper toes this sometimes.  Like in his book The Future Of Justifications toys with the idea in there that in some sense at the judgement works will be presented to sort of justify your justification so you better have them.Like this from   gtPresent justification is based on the substitutionary work of Christ alone enjoyed in union with him through faith alone. Future justification is the open confirmation and declaration that in Christ Jesus we are perfectly blameless before God. This final judgment accords with our works. That is the fruit of the Holy Spirit in our lives will be brought forward as the evidence and confirmation of true faith and union with Christ. Without that validating transformation there will be no future salvation.I think I know what hes getting at??  But I smell some weirdness too. And some curious stuff in Future GracegtHow then can I say that the judgment of believers will not only be the public declaration of our differing rewards in the kingdom of God according to our deeds but will also be the public declaration of our salvation  our entering the kingdom  according to our deeds? The answer is that our deeds will be the public evidence brought forth in Christs courtroom to demonstrate that our faith is real. And our deeds will be the public evidence brought fourth to demonstrate the varying measures of our obedience of faith. In other words salvation is by grace through faith and rewards are by grace through faith but the evidence of invisible faith in the judgment hall of Christ will be a transformed life.,Reformed,cu8vicj,0,t5_2riuy

5423707,0,t1_cw3u53l,gtYou said Actually the Greek is pretty clearly defined. Either by dictionary or historical clues. You are just wrong in this.gtActually a direct translation from English to Coptic language to English doesnt make much sense. The Coptics might have a closer word choice but it still cannot be directly translated.gtThis is not what I said  the original Greek was translated to Coptic and that language WORKS like English in that it contains the definite and indefinite article. This allows a Coptic translation to stand on its own with little to no speculation on what the text means. I found this explanation perhaps to help...Ah my bad. Fair enough.gt John  Assumptions vs. Factsgt               John  Sahidic Coptic textgtIt has been postulated that the Egyptian Coptic translators of the ndrd centuries would not have meant to say that the Word was a god  even though that is precisely what they wrote      because their translation would have been informed by the theology of the great Egyptian theologians like Clement of Alexandria. As translated into English by Trinitarian scholars the writings of Clement appear to promote the concept that the Word was God.gtBut it is only an assumption not fact to suppose that the Coptic translators would have been influenced by Clement of Alexandria who had left Egypt for Jerusalem and Antioch Syria by  AD. AnteNicene Fathers volume  p.  Besides Clement was a pagan philosopher a disciple of Socrates and Plato before adopting Christianity and his works show his continued interest in such philosophy to the point where he has been accused of corrupting the gospel with Greek philosophy. AnteNicene Fathers volume  pp.   Encyclopedia of Early Christianity p. According to its own tradition the Coptic Church was founded by the evangelist Mark. We need only read Marks Gospel to see what he preached and what the earliest Egyptian Christians would have believed. Marks Gospel has the simplest of Christologies and there is no doctrine of the Trinitiy in the Gospel of Mark.True if youre looking for explicit examples. But several claims to supreme divinity such as the end of Mark  and Mark  and Mark  and Mark  Isaiah I am Jehovah and there is no one else.There is no God except me.I will strengthenyou although you did not  meJohn In the beginning was the Wordand the Word was with Godand the Word was a god.gtThe Coptic translation of John c lacks the corruption of Greek philosophy that found its way into the church after the death of the apostles of the Lord. And that is still another reason why the Coptic translation matters.What does the Coptic bible render the Isaiah verse as?Coptic John c is a prime example. The Coptic translation  gt.u.noute pe p.Saje the Word was a god or divine not the Word was God. That is documented evidence a fact not an assumption. The Coptic language has both indefinite and definite articles in its grammatical structure. If the Sahidic Coptic translators held the doctrine that the Word was God or if the Coptic translators understood the Greek text to say the Word was God the Coptic language had the grammatical tools to say so.gtBut they manifestly did not write the Word was God. They wrote the Word was a god. Unlike the assumptions that is a fact. It is a fact that can be verified by reading the extant Coptic texts as evidence.gtFacts are always better than assumptions.You saidHow can grieving an active force be possible?gtKing James Version Eph  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.gtThis simply means to sin against knowledge  the knowledge provided to Christ followers as was promised when one is filled with this spirit. Acts  is a good example of this of many recorded in the bible.Lupeo or do not grieve means to make sad. It stems from the root word for mourning. So how can you cause an active force or body of knowledge to mourn?gtYou said  RCUSgtStrictly speaking I believe you have no world wide Group and if  did how effective is it in transforming its members to not put there countries issues above their loyalty to each other world wide. What outreach do they have in contrast to any other non effective Christian religion today. We have built five Kingdom Halls every day for the last fifteen years we have the bible and part of the bible and bible based instruction in nearly a thousand languages. And all of this has been done without charge or regard for country of origin. We simply build houses of where they are needed and regardless of the source of the funds needed. Thats good for you. However the RCUS left a heretical denomination and chose not to merge. That denomination was the UCC. So being a body thats still very small we dont have nearly as much money. Does bragging about the size of a denomination win arguments? Im sure the Catholic church can give you a run for your money.gtI would say that anything you can say about our bible or our beliefs including rejecting the Trinity is trumped in every way by the clear to see way that we have been blessed by God in our efforts to restore true worship of our namesake Jehovah! We are . million strong  all ordained ministers who refuse to act contrary to the God we know and love by even using tobacco products. We stand alone in sharp contrast in that we disfellowshiping something like fourth thousand unrepentant sinners each year for mostly immorality but also any serious sin that a baptized member does not exhibit a desire to cut out to comply with clear bible based correction. Despite this we are growing at an impressive rate and have about twenty million un baptized people who are associating with us though bible study  are working to become part of Gods clean peopleAgain. How many Catholics are there? Its a false church too. Besides does God bring forth rain on the just or unjust?gtNo I can find nothing that indicates that the RCUS is any different than the many other religions who can not even unite with in them selfs let alone work to convert the world in any measurable way.Presbytery. We arent a bunch of southern baptists. If you claim we cant unite its ignorant of Reformed Polity. gtBut like I said any denomination that has members in the military can not say that they are seriously prepared to  show for a world wide brotherhood!

5520200,0,t1_cwh8ov1,Coincidentally I asked this question in a paper presentation on Tuesday morning this week.I believe that Romans  basically says that all are under all of the law if they choose to be under any of the law. Israel by participating in the terms of the Mosaic Covenant were subject to the whole Mosaic law. Any nonHebrew who attempted to seek salvation through the law would be subject to the entire law. I might be off base here and probably would find dispensationalists who would disagree with me but I would suggest that there is also a nonMosaic sense of the law that is contained in the OT law but also exists outside of the Mosaic law. For example murder was against Gods moral law before it was enscripturated at Sinai. Christ was faithful to the Mosaic law but he was also faithful to Gods extramosaic moral law.

The reason for his doubt about eternal punishment is his conviction that God loves all humans and desires to save them all. His argument is simple Those who are loved by God will not perish. The title of the middle chapter of the book is Does God Get What God Wants? If the premise is right God loves all humans the conclusion is soundand orthodox there is no hell. The love of God cannot be defeated. As Pastor Bell puts it Love wins. As the Reformed faith puts it The love of God is sovereign! The day I am convinced that God loves all humans without exception on that day I become a universalista very bold universalist. Most of those opposing Bell share his conviction about the universality of the love of God in the gospel of Jesus Christ. But they condemn his conclusion. For them the love of God fails.

5735495,0,t1_cx78ajx,Apologies for the delay. I had some internet issues last night.First I am not the one who says Satan is bound. John says this at the end of Revelation that before the millennium Satan is bound. And this reference is not the only one in the Bible of the devil being defeated. Plus there is other phrases in  Peter that are expectant of a something that will happen shortly       . Are we to be always expecting the devil prowling as well the everlasting beginning of judgement from God and always expecting glory that will never be reveled? In context of what is said elsewhere in the Bible Mt.  the answer is no.Second consider  Peter gtShe who is at Babylon who is likewise chosen sends you greetings and so does Mark my son.This Christian woman who is with Peter is in Babylon. But Babylon is no longer existing in this point in history. Also the empire that did occupy former Babylonian lands the Parthian Empire did not care or trouble for Christianity as much as the Romans. See here in the section Christianity in Persia and here th paragraph But it does make sense for the Peter to call Rome Babylon in light of the apocalyptic language found elsewhere in the New Testament especially Revelation.Now why is this detail important? Because it reinforces the notion that  Peter is written while the events of Revelation are taking place and before Satan is bound and the millennium begins.Finally you have to remember that Peter was martyred around  AD before Jerusalem was destroyed in  AD and certainly before the fulfillment of permillennial Revelation and the binding of the Devil.

6713476,0,t3_47jhva,As I wrote out for another person struggling with hermeneutics and creationismTheres a lot of books on the topic but one simple and accessible one that Ive used for my hermeneutics class in Bible college was Living by the Book by Hendricks and Hendricks.  It gave a great way of understanding all kinds of context that shed light on the passages in question  not just what they meant but what they didnt mean.  And its not just a book to read but has several exercises and practice passages in it that you can work on yourself.  A couple of other books that were very helpful for me were Blue Like Jazz Nonreligious Thoughts on Christian Spirituality by Donald Miller Finding God by Larry Crabb and A New Kind of Christian by Brian McLaren.  Because this is still rReformed Id like to point out that McLarens book challenged a lot of my thinking but did not turn me Emergent or anything like that.As far as information on individual books a good study Bible should provide the information youre looking for there with introductions to each individual book as well as notes on the text.As far as the creation story vs the resurrection story goes this is kind of a favorite soapbox of mine this is a great example of how religious literary and cultural context make a difference in interpretation.  Have you ever heard of Herodotus?  He was a Greek guy and hes kind of a big deal because he was the first guy to critically compare different stories about the past and try to figure out what really happened.  Hes called the father of modern history because no one else before him did that.  Heres why hes important.The story of Genesis came before Herodotus and obviously in a different part of the world.  The people who told creation stories  not just the Israelites but the Babylonians and Sumerians and others like them  werent interested in figuring out what really happened.  They were interested in telling stories that made them and their royal dynasties look more important and powerful than everyone elses.  So they told stories about how the universe arose out of chaos or war or sex between the gods and how their ruler was a byproduct of that.  And then comes along God and the Israelite narrative.  What does the Israelite narrative tell us?  A lot of things God isnt just a local god and Hes not fighting against other gods Hes THE God creator of everything.   Everything didnt just arise out of chaos but came through meticulous design and architecture God loves humanity but we broke our relationship with Him though He will provide a way for that relationship to be restored.  The Genesis narrative answers really fundamental and really universal questions about God and humanity really well.  Lets turn around and look at the story of the resurrection now.  Its postHerodotus people really were concerned about what really happened.  And so you get a truer historical narrative than what the Genesis account presents.  This is why people who believe in YEC have to do mental contortions to make science and the Bible fit  because they are forcing the Genesis account to answer questions it was never intended to.,Reformed,d0dqbsa,3,t5_2riuy

Paul says that we do it to proclaim the Lords death until he comes. We remember Jesus individually as we examine ourselves and eat and drink and we remind each other corporately both of Jesus work for all of us and for the body that we comprise together and this points us to the larger body the invisible church. Like you said theres no mystical thing happening but its an earthly picture of a spiritual reality.

We definitely cant afford the new house without the rent from the old.Im pretty fiscally conservative and riskaverse so this would be a deal breaker for me.  Mainly because the house you are renting out becomes a necessary source of income for you to be in a good financial position.  That is a lot of risk.  My thoughts would be different if you could afford the new house payments without the rental income.gt However I dont see that as being too different from saying I cant afford my current house if I lost my job. True.  And you could afford two houses even less.gtThe first home is a source of income and if that income goes away it changes what we can afford just like a job.You are focusing a lot on the similarities between a job income and rental income.  Focus on the differences particularly in terms of risk.  The odds of you losing your job are low if it isnt then you should not be thinking about this but the odds of having a month or so without tenants or having a large expenditure is higher.gtAlso the first home is only  years old. I understand that sht happens but Im expecting it to be fairly reliable as long as we keep up with regular maintenance. Shouldnt be needing a new roof or pipes or major repairs any time soon.Good to know.gtWe would also hope to find renters that are from within our church network so we have people that are trustworthy and arent going to trash the place.Also good but I know some very clean nonbelievers and some very messy and accidentprone Christians.All that was pretty devils advocatey and worse case scenario.

For the better effecting whereof he has power to call synods to be present at them and to provide that whatsoever is transacted in them be according to the mind of God.But my denomination the RPCNA affirms only Civil magistrates may not assume to themselves the administration of the Word and sacraments or the power of the keys of the kingdom of heaven and rejects the rest of the paragraph.

As Chrysostom writes on  Cor. gtNay say they it is not His being of another substance which we intend to show from hence but that He is under subjection. What then are we to say to this? In the first place when any thing lowly is said of him conjoined as He is with the Flesh there is no disparagement of the Godhead in what is said the Economy admitting the expression. gtIf it is not Christs divinity which is subject to the Father then what does  Cor  mean?Again Chrysostom is good here but I bit long to quote in entirety.Here is somegtHow then is it? for in truth there are many questions following one upon another. Well give me then your earnest attention since in fact it is necessary for us first to speak of the scope of Paul and his mind which one may find everywhere shining forth and then to subjoin our solution this being itself an ingredient in our solution.gtWhat then is Pauls mind and what is his custom? He speaks in one way when he discourses of the Godhead alone and in another when he falls into the argument of the economy. Thus having once taken hold of our Lords Flesh he freely thereafter uses all the sayings that humiliate Him without fear as though that were able to bear all such expressions. Let us see therefore here also whether his discourse is of the simple Godhead or whether in view of the incarnation he asserts of Him those things which he saith or rather let us first point out where he did this of which I have spoken. Where then did he this? Writing to the Philippians he saith Who being in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with God but emptied Himself of no reputation taking the form of a servant being made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself becoming obedient even unto death yea the death of the cross. Wherefore hath God highly exalted Him. Philip. ii. .gtSeest thou how when he was discoursing of the Godhead alone he uttered those great things that He was in the form of God and that He was equal with Him that begat Him and to Him refers the whole? But when He showed Him to thee made flesh he lowered again the discourse. For except thou distinguish these things there is great variance between the things spoken. Since if He were equal with God how did He highly exalt one equal with Himself? If He were in the form of God how gave He Him a name? for he that giveth giveth to one that hath not and he that exalteth exalteth one that is before abased. He will be found then to be imperfect and in need before He hath received the exaltation and the Name and many other absurd corollaries will hence follow. But if thou shouldest add the incarnation thou wilt not err in saying these things. These things then here also consider and with this mind receive thou the expressions.gtAnd that thou mayest learn that this is the reason of the things spoken I would ask thee this question Doth an additional subjection at that time befal the Son? And how can this be other than impious and unworthy of God? For the greatest subjection and obedience is this that He who is God took the form of a servant. How then will He be subjected? Seest thou that to take away the impious notion he used this expression? and this too in a suitable though reserved sense? For he becomes a Son and a divine Person so He obeys not humanly but as one acting freely and having all authority. Otherwise how is he coenthroned? How as the Father raiseth up even so He whom He will? John . How are all things that the Father hath His and all that He hath the Fathers? John . For these phrases indicate to us an authority exactly measured by that of Him that begat Him.Calvin is also quite good heregtThe request for quotations of theologians who say that EFSESS is unorthodox.In as much as this essay and many Fathers show that they err in not properly affirming thisgtNothing in this trinity is before or after    nothing is greater or smaller    in their entirety the three persons    are coeternal and coequal with each other.    So in everything as was said earlier    we must worship their trinity in their unity    and their unity in their trinity.Anyone then who desires to be savedshould think thus about the trinity.Or in Chrysostom again on  Cor.  he begins withgtBut the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God. Here the heretics rush upon us with a certain declaration of inferiority which out of these words they contrive against the Son. Or Gregory NanzianzengtFor as these low earthly minds make the Son subject to the Father so again is the rank of the Spirit made inferior to that of the Son until both God and created life are insulted by the new Theology.... I should like to call the Father the greater because from him flows both the Equality and the Being of the Equals this will be granted on all hands but I am afraid to use the word Origin lest I should make Him the Origin of Inferiors and thus insult Him by precedencies of honour. For the lowering of those Who are from Him is no glory to the Source. Moreover I look with suspicion at your insatiate desire for fear you should take hold of this word Greater and divide the Nature using the word Greater in all senses whereas it does not apply to the Nature but only to Origination.Or AmbrosegtBut if they think of this as the subjection of the Son namely that the Father makes all things in union with His will let them learn that this is really a proof of inseparable power. For the unity of Their will is one that began not in time but ever existed. But where there is a constant unity of will there can be no weakness of temporal subjection. For if He were made subject through His nature He would always remain in subjection but since He is said to be made subject in time that subjection must be part of an assumed office....In short we reject as do the Fathers and the scriptures this third category of subjection.  Every single time a passage related to Christ being subject to the Father the Fathers and the Reformers make clear that this is temporal in lieu of redemption thus Economic according to His flesh.  They go out of their way to make sure this is clear because there is no type of eternal subordination or unequal authority relational or otherwise.

I hadnt thought of defining life as the opposite of death in order to figure out what it means. Death in a biblical sense has more to do with the concept of loss rather than the concepts of damage or cessation. Remember the lady who lost her coin? She killed it in the Greek. So life would entail some elements of being found. So the Christian concept of  I was lost but then I was found that you hear about in various hymns actually resembles the biblical notion of we were dead but now we are alive. Kind of interesting.By no means exhaustive as rocks and coins can be alive if we go too far with the comparison but overall the idea of understanding the nature of life via the concept of death is quite helpful.

8227885,0,t1_d560s3d,Firstly Im sorry my comment upset you.   Most of the christian women Ive talked to who were virgins and entirely sexually inexperienced on their wedding night havent said that it hurt although some have said there was discomfort for a few moments.   Im quite prepared to accept that that might be misrepresentative and Im sorry if that sets up unhelpful expecations.  I think there are other factors which mean that sex is less likely to be painful even for those with no sexual experience namely a slightly later age at marriage and the use of tampons and menstrual cups.   It would have been better if Id mentioned those as well in my st  comment. Id also suggest that many men historically were probably pretty ignorant of the romance and tenderness of Song of Songs  my impression is that even in a Christian culture many people did not read the bible for themselves and Song of songs was rarely read publically.  At least Id say that of my own country in centuries past.    During those centuries there were various books about instructing men on how to please woman mainly because a womans pleasure was thought by some to be vital to conception but my understanding is that these were not available to the vast majority of men.   I may be entirely wrong!  Again this may be more specific to the culture in which I live but I think that even men brought up in Christian families still have a greater awareness of sex and how to make it pleasurable than many virgin men would in the past.   This is an inevitable result of an extremely oversexualised culture.  Youre right I should have put more in my post along the lines of dont expect everything to go perfectly.   I think the main way to help with pressure is an attitude of kissing enjoying and not worrying too much whether everything is done on that first night or not.  Although both are naturally nervous I dont think its something to be afraid of and I think that expecting that its likely to be painful or unpleasant makes pain and discomfort far more likely simply because of how womens bodies work!Im honestly surprised by your very different reports back from Christian women whose first intimacy was on their wedding night.  Ive felt like the conversations Ive had with married women about this have been very frank.  By the way Im a woman  not a married one but as one who had lived with men before being saved a number of women at church have sought me out for conversations and advice individually and Ive also been a part of conversations amongst married women which certainly men and I think also most unmarried women unless engaged would have never been included in.  I still think that the most helpful thing OPs fiancee could do is to speak to an older wiser married woman particularly maybe an elders wife or pastors wife.  And then especially after marriage I definitely think that a couples sex life should be a matter for prayer for both of them.  ,Reformed,d561ios,4,t5_2riuy

But watch out!gtIve read the reviews by complementarians in my socalled circles that while having sympathy for Tuckers story of abuse say they cannot give their recommendation of the book even turning their reviews into corresponding arguments of why Tuckers egalitarianism is wrong....I am bothered by how these reviews from within my own circles have not really listened have not really learned and have not really engaged with Ruth Tucker.When people disagree with conclusions its because they dont understand them. If you disagree with this conclusion then just read the end of this sentence where I say that you havent understood it.gt I am not an egalitarian.

It exposes them to more abuse. And so it is fuel for an abuser. These are devastating quotes that need to be addressed. We must askwhat is being taught in the name of complementarianism? Are all of its teachings biblical? That is a question I have been asking the leaders in the movement for a while now. Ok so lets leave aside wisdom being twisted by evil men to justify evil deeds. Why be a complementarian if this is your view? If the position can so quickly be used to support abusive leadership then why not be an egalitarian. Most people defend what they think is true when its being maligned and suborned to commit sin not tear it down.gt...a book peppered with quotes from leading complementarians who blame women for their abuse reduce complementarity to male authority and female submission send victims back into abusive homes for the sake of submission teach a distorted view of masculinity and femininity and reduce women to the role of elevating men. What exactly does distorted view of masculinity and femininity mean? The Bible is pretty clear that wives must submit to husbands. This isnt a distortion of malefemale roles its the actual roles themselves.gtSo heres my question why are complementarians so quick to call out an abuse victims egalitarianism and yet so absolutely silent about the troubling teaching she quotes from many leading complementarians?Because they think theyre wrong! Look you dont have to convince anyone that men are capable of great hypocrisy and blindness to their own faults. Thats a given.

Ive been happily married for  years to a woman way out of my league and weve made it through lots of stressful situations so I figure I do know a thing or two.Granted I dont know anything about your situation and you should do what you think is best.I would not generally advise counseling or at least I would not go together because the bulk of the marriage advice Ive ever heard in the evangelical church anyway has been Husbands if your wife is unhappy its because youre a big fat jerk.  You just need to be nicer.  Like Jesus.  Because nobody ever got mad at Him. To be honest everything probably is your fault but in a different sense.You are the captain of the ship.  The buck stops with you just like it would with the actual captain of an actual ship.  You will delegate responsibility and duties but its still all on your shoulders.You are both responsible for yourself personally and for your marriage corporately.  Youre the captain or the CEO.Your marriage suffers when the captain is incompetent.  Its not his primary job to make sure the crew is happy but to make sure things are ship shape.  And if youve ever worked for an amazing boss you know that everyone is much happier in that kind of situation.So more than likely you are failing to provide good consistent authentic leadership.  Things are not going well because youre a bad captain and that stresses the crew out and that frustrates you and now the crew is insubordinate and... I am speaking from personal experience here.What would a good captain do?  What would Picard do?Wouldnt he call Riker to the ready room to review the situation and calmly discuss their options?  And then get opinions and input think it through calmly make a plan communicate it and consistently ensure its being carried out?Heres an example from my own life in the last  hours.  Its long and you wont miss much if you skip it.My wife is very driven.  Give her a pile of work and she will tear into it to the detriment of pesky things like food and sleep.Were doing limited homeschooling through the summer because we got behind on a few subjects for various reasons.  This has not gone well.  Homeschooling and chores tend to run way late throwing off meal times destroying free  family time ruining bedtimes etc.Last night she kind of freaked out at me.  She wanted to go for a walk hunting Pokemon to be honest but there was no apparent way it would fit in the schedule.  Because she was frustrated she took a comment from me wrong and just blew up.Later that night after the immediate crisis had passed I printed out copies of a schedule she and I had put together a while back.  Turns out that instead of using it as a schedule she was using it as a checklist.So first thing I did was ask her to review the schedule to see if everything still made sense as far as how long we had for each thing and if the order was right.  We fixed a couple of things.Then I took out a pen and underlined the things I really cared about  lunch supper family worship bedtimes.  Those things are fixed points.  They dont slip just because something else took too long.Now heres the key  I didnt just give her the schedule.  I followed up.  I made sure she was hitting those things I said were important.  Lunch was a little late but we finished it about on time.  Supper was within about  minutes.  We finished supper early and had time to go for a walk hunting Pokemon.  I did give in a little bit and let us stay later than we should though.  When we got home she headed to give the girls a bath because that was the next thing on the schedule.  But it was time for family worship and Id already decided that would not slip  because I knew if we let it slip we wouldnt do it.  So I redirected.  We did family worship she bathed the girls the kids were in bed at nearly the right time.  A bit late but we did the important things and everything was calm.So no my advice would be to start by fixing the things you know that need to be fixed.  Make an honest assessment of your ship.  Hows it running?  How are the finances whats the physical state how smoothly are things going?  Hows the crew morale?  Is the chain of command working appropriately?  Talk it over calmly with your first officer.  Then  with her input of course  you start making decisions on how you want your family to work.  Make sure you take her thoughts into consideration  listen to her in that sense but if you think it needs to work differently dont be afraid to make a decision.  You should be the one providing the initiative here.  Dont tell her how to fix herself.  You work on fixing you and on establishing how your ship is going to run and then follow up and make sure that happens.  You wont get it perfect the first time of course but it wont be a disaster either.  Shell probably find it much easier to throw her support behind her captain when she sees that he knows what he should be doing and is actively pursuing it.  It will inspire loyalty and support.,Reformed,d5e5wwa,7,t5_2riuy

8348118,0,t3_4tuxsh,How old are your kids?  Ill come back and post some of the stuff Ive used at naptime.NOTE This is slanted toward girls because our older kids are girls.I like studies that walk kids through a passage or book of the Bible providing relevant vocabulary and asking provoking questions.  Then you kind of learn the how by practicing it and then you can do it yourself.Doorposts has tons of topical stuff   Like this one for girls based on various sections of Scripture one at a time and this one on Proverbs   The Busy Mamas series explicitly teaches Bible study methods enough to make me want to bash my head against the wall honestly and I suspect it would be most useful for teenage girls and they could even do the with kids section with younger siblings its made for young moms to do the study by themselves and with their younger children.  AFAIK Doorposts theology is conservative even patriarchal  and Reformed not sure if they are Baptist or Presbyterian although Id guess Presbyterian.On the younger end I havent read all of them and the theology is kind of generic but Kathy Huttos Bible studies for preteens have been really appealing and useful for our kids girls again once they get a good grasp of reading  around  or so.  It walks them through Bible books chapter by chapter with relevant background info.  This is the perfect format imho I just wish there were more resources like this by more clearly reliable theologians.  I feel the need to preread these although Ive yet to find anything bad.Christian Liberty Presss Journey Through the Bible series newish is great inasmuch as its basically a read this passage then b consider these questions.  Also Presbyterian.Tapestry of Graces Garden Tryst intended for mothers but I cant think of anything mothery specific in themwalks through really applying Scripture and somewhat guiding prayer.  Its... more involved than Id like but its a little deeper than just answer these questions.  Its got stuff like think about whats going on in your life what fruit is coming from it kill the bad fruit etc.  Im not a fan but I know a lot of people whove found it really helpful and transformative.  This is by SGM people.Lastly the Navigators  step Bible study method is useful training wheels that served me well as a teenagerwithout step  which bothers me a bit.  I also liked MacArthurs How to Study The Bible  and theres a longer format a whole book about it.  I ended up making my own stepbystep plan blending the two.  And at some point though it just becomes habit to think about those principles without prompting.And show em how to use eSword and load it up with some good commentaries.EDIT II Not that Bible study and associated praying is synonymous with private worship but I guess I think of it as being the part that most needs teaching.EDIT III Just remembered the name of another one The Practice of Piety by Lewis Bayly.

The crops werent chopped down already and bundled up for them.What you said about gleaning is true but actually the Old Testament welfare system was about more than just gleaning. There was also a  tax for the poor a tithe of all food harvested was required to be given to the poor and the immigrants.  There were also laws about caring for single moms. They were not left to fend for themselves there were specific procedures of who would marry a widow and care for her and her children.  There were also laws specifically requiring the caring for aliensforeigners.  Then there was the whole Jubilee thing which is radical compared to our governments welfare system. I think its great that you have a calling to care for the fatherless me the same as you. I was a foster parents and at the moment am not but will one day take it up again. I dont think everyone needs to be a foster parents or adopted parents but I think everyone should care for the widow and orphan. For some people it might just mean financially supporting them or it might mean taking that bigger step like you and I have done by opening our homes to them. I think its awesome that you are a stay at home homeschooling mom as well. I think single moms on welfare working minimum wage jobs with their kids in subsidized daycare should have the same priviledge as you. They shouldnt have to work all day for less pay than the cost to care for their own kids. Their work should be caring for their kids and teaching them like you do with your kids.  What happens with our welfare system is that it forces this moms to work for slave wageswages so low that it doesnt even cover rent and expenses and pays someone else to raise them and then pays them welfare to subsidize the costs which the slavery level wages dont cover.  This is what I mean about capitalism being antifamily.

The Creed is plain As touching His Godhead equal to the Father as touching His Manhood less than the Father.Further Pruitts aim and critique is well justified pointing out that Burk is way out in left field in his interpretation of Phil .And last this worthless functional language solves nothing and is part of the larger problem and absurdity of their arguments. Burk and the gang want to have some sort of coequality but also subordination among the Persons that is not just temporal. They attempt to do this by saying the Persons are not in a relation of authority and submission ontologically but rather in role and function. This may seem to be in line with the subordination of modes of operation or something but when they ground these modes of operation in eternity upon fatherhoodsonship and begettingbegotten they are necessarily defining the Persons as to who they are in themselves not just what they have agreed to do or voluntary roles. Using the s sociological language of role and function does not sidestep the fact that these are of necessity ontological statements. If roles are eternal and necessitated by order of origination and sonshipfatherhood then the Persons of the Trinity must relate according to authority and submission by the very distinctions and defining properties of their Persons for it could not be otherwise. It is no role or function. Burk et al cannot claim that their use of roles or functions equate to anything other than necessary modes of subsistence of the Persons i.e. ontological subordination.  Remember Burk says that the Son did not want to usurp the role of the Father in eternity.  Was this just a role or function of the Father for Burk?  Give me a break.

Its not that faith is equal to works in Judaism and its not even that works must be done with faith they dont!. Faith is some distant and unimportant consequence that is given to the select few.Faith is thus not seen as a personal initiative but something inherited and collective. Works on the other hand  everyone can do works. But in this Jewish view salvation is not from doing works and certainly not from faith in a savior which savior exactly!?. Indeed salvation is not seen on the individual level either but at the collective level as well. Salvation happens as a consequence of remaining in the covenant sustained by the community. Without works however you are not in the covenant but rather defiling it. The punishment comes from neglecting your duty to uphold the covenant.Judaism posits that in many senses the fulfillment of the commandments not only satisfies ones personal or communal obedience to God but that they actually perform some kind of cosmic changeThe above is vastly different from anything found in Paul and even James Christ not works has changed and repaired the world. The redemption has already come. Christ is the perfected. He is the fulfillment of the law this makes even more sense once the Jewish view of cosmic perfection through law is seen  Christ is that cosmic perfection and thus the works of the law are fulfilled. Works are essentially personal inward actions not communalcosmic actions Abraham is saved by faith which led to him being ready to sacrifice his son. He was not deemed holy because of his potential act of sacrifice but because he had so much faith he was counted as righteous. All righteousness comes from faith. Faith is not only a prerequisite to righteousness ! but is the lone source of it. Here is sola fide Faith as in Abraham as in any exemplar of faith leads to works. It leads toward a desire to be righteous and holy. This is true faith. It is different than the pharisaical notion of faith which is merely an intellectualassenting type of faith  because thats the kind of faith demons have.

9174538,0,t3_55xnwt,Consider prayer worship. As such a few things fall out and hopefully a few things you can do to improve it.  There are books that say this better but Ill hope to digest...Prayer is our response to God. As such it is our worship of God. This worship takes a few forms. First when you pray My Father who is in heaven you express that Gods name is glorious. You can actively seek things that provoke this thinking in you. Isaiah  comes to mind or a massive thunder storm knowing that God has set limits which that storm shall never pass. Another form of our worship is that in praying for our daily bread in seeking God as our only provider of those things we need we acknowledge Him as sovereign and because we are daring to ask things of Him we acknowledge him as good and loving. In so doing we proclaim our adoption as Sons and the entirety of the gospel is poised to fall from our lips. To cultivate this try to understand how small and needy we all are. Again scripture can help with this. Ecclesiasties? Job. Christopher Ashs book on Job is wonderful!To summarize what others have said indeed Pray.

I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.  And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. And I see washing in Titusgt  But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared  he saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit  whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior  so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life. Are you arguing that the washing that is referenced in Titus is not  water baptism because water is not mentioned therefore Titus  is not water baptism?  If so you negate the water appearing in the other baptism passages.  I dont think that such neglect is consistent with the text and the Churchs historical interpretation of the text.  By you logic which is that washing and regeneration occurs without water Philip did not need to baptize the Eunuch in Acts .  Contrary to your dry baptism theory though Scripture seems to indicate the water baptism was much more important than your interpretation indicatesgt  The eunuch asked Philip Tell me please who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else?  Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.  As they traveled along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said Look here is water. What can stand in the way of my being baptized?  And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him. It sure seems like the good news that Philip was teaching was more than pray to receive Jesus into your heart.  Especially if the Eunuch responded to the good news by taking the first opportunity in which he was presented with water to be baptized. ,Reformed,d9bvn9s,-1,t5_2riuy

And indeed I think my point speaks more directly to most laymens concerns than your argument if youll forgive the suggestion.My interlocutor says I have been fighting for the word submit for a long time suggesting hes concerned about the notion that submission as an activity somehow demeans the value of the person doing the submitting. This is an axiological concern not an ontological one. But proNicene objections to ESSEFSERAS have everything to do with the ontological mechanics of proNicene theology not the axiological valence of submission as an activity. Which is simply neither here nor there. It isnt that submission cheapens the Son somehow. We have no axiological objections to the notion of submission amongst equals. Which come to think of it is actually bad for the ESSEFSERAS position which wants to insist that submission entails authority when it clearly does not. But that aside the real proNicene objection is that in order for us to speak sensibly about the Son submitting to the Father as within the Godhead we have to abandon homoousios. Not because of the axiological valence of submission but because of the allocation of wills to natures rather than persons. Butprobably because it goes over their headsESSEFSERAS proponents simply dont seem to get that the proNicene objection to their position has nothing to do with axiology and completely fail to appreciate the ontological implications of their own position.I know my interlocutor here certainly does which is why Im not talking to him anymore.,Reformed,d9lyavk,1,t5_2riuy

For we do not receive these things as common bread or common drink but as Jesus Christ our Savior being incarnate by Gods Word took flesh and blood for our salvation so also we have been taught that the food consecrated by the Word of prayer which comes from him from which our flesh and blood are nourished by transformation is the flesh and blood of that incarnate Jesus.First Apology Ch.  inter A.D. .Justin Martyr does not read symbolic at all.

As the blessed apostle says in his letter to the Ephesians For we are members of His Body of His flesh and of His bones Eph. . He is not talking about some kind of spiritual and invisible man for a spirit does not have flesh an bones Lk. . No he is talking of the organism possessed by a real human being composed of flesh and nerves and bones.

The stem of the vine takes root in the earth and eventually bears fruit and the grain of wheat falls into the earth Jn.  dissolves rises again multiplied by the allcontaining Spirit of God and finally after skilled processing is put to human use. These two then receive the Word of God and become the Eucharist which is the Body and Blood of Christ.Five Books on the Unmasking and Refutation of the Falsely Named Gnosis.

9945311,0,t3_5hvi0z,The Lord is really testing my faith it seems. Ive been praying for three things the past week  That the newborn boy of the couple at our church would survive. He was born with some sort of mass on his head and with liver failure. That a couple at our previous church would survive their recent separation and that she would not want to ultimately go through the divorce with him. He is I believe a godly man who has fallen into severe sexual sin. He hasnt committed physical adultery but he has engaged in adulterous emotional relationships with women online. Our church and state law stand behind her choice to go through with the divorce after a oneyear separation. They have a year old son. I believe in his willingness to repent of his sin but she does not. She has been hurt in this way several times over the past few years and she seems to be settled in her desire for divorce. I had an interview for a great next step in my career. It was on  and they said they would let me know by the end of the week. I am working through a staffing agency so they would let me know not the hiring company. I havent heard back yet and it seems its not necessarily because I didnt get the job but my staffing agent has been out sick on Friday and today. The Lord is testing my patience because the baby boy died on ThursdayThe situation with our friends is not looking good.

Make Grace your song of thanksgiving.gtI know they dont struggle as deeply as I doThe true secret is that they do. Maybe in different areas. Maybe in different ways. I shared my crippling social anxiety with my congregation on Sunday and had person after person tell me Me too. I also feel like a Martian living a fake life and desperately afraid that all these nice people will find out Im totally alien. People struggle far more than they will share. No one wants to be the first penguin to jump into the water and get eaten by the seal but once that first penguin goes  everyone follows. Were just penguins you and I. Be the first to break through the ice of openly admitting your weaknesses and watch how many are freed to be authentic because of your risk. You might be surprised.gtI want to be the perfect Christian girl but Im not even close. And if I were on my way there Im back to square one now. How do I get out of this pattern of super perfect then going wild then cleaning up and trying again?Stop depending on yourself for righteousness. Cut off friends and habits even though they may be good in themselves if they lead you to do things that dont support godliness. Dancing might be fine. A girls night out might be fine. Suzie might be fine. But if everytime you go out with Suzie dancing on a girls night you wind up blackout drunk or promiscuous perhaps you need to stop doing it. Find your triggers. Do they get you to your desired personal holiness? No? Then stop doing them. gtWill it ever get easier?The fact is that a Christian life is not composed of big decisions and actions for God. The Christian life is made up of a thousand daily decisions to not compromise to deny self to serve and to choose the better option. These all grow together to form a mosaic that represents your life. A hundred little compromises create a life of compromise. But a thousand little choices of righteousness make a righteous life. So yes in some sense it can get easier as good choices become a habit  but no it doesnt get easier in that the choices always have to be made. You never get holy enough to not have to continually take every thought captive for Christ.,Reformed,dbbiuj8,1,t5_2riuy

Im not always satisfied by worship at my church but when I start to examine myself I almost always find that the problem is with me.That said there are always deficiencies in our worship and its only through Christs mediatorial work that our worship is made acceptable. But if youre being convicted by the Spirit of problems with the worship at the church you attend you should address them with your elder or pastor. If that doesnt solve the issue maybe its time to move on.gt In summary I know that the church Im attending now has substance and preaches the Gospel but the Orthodox provides more structure on the day to day.I think the content of worship is more important than the form though the form is still significant.The Westminster Confession of Faith puts it well in Chapter  Of Religious Worship and the Sabbath Day WCF ,Reformed,dd6tu30,2,t5_2riuy

Its like a church sign but with a lot more detail. Giving information to members is a relatively simple task that can be done via email or inperson on Sunday.Be sure to treat the website as a simulation of a conversation. If John Smith called up the church and started asking questions how would the conversation go? What would he ask? How would you answer?

It goes something like . There were apostles. . The apostles needed helpers so they found some in Acts .  These ones needed to be male. . These helpers to the apostles seemed to be called evangelists as Philip was later called an evangelists. . Note that Paul a later apostle had helpers of Titus and Timothy.  Titus raised up elders which deacons cannot do and Paul said Timothy was doing the work of an evangelist from what I recall. . Deacons cannot raise up elders or preach like Stephen did before getting killed if memory serves so it would seem they were not the deacons we see today but instead this evangelist that is hinted to in a few places. . Reflecting the apostleevangelist relationship local churches ended up with an elderdeacon dynamic.  The qualifications for these deacons does not specify male.   .  In fact one of the lists of qualifications lists out elder qualifications then likewise for male deacons then likewise for their wiveswomen in the same list. .  It would seem Paul specifically mentioned women in the qualification for deacon.  If that was not his intent why not mention qualifications for the wives of male elders earlier?  Why should deacons wives be more qualified than elders wives? .

11055727,0,t3_5xtume,I think all sin is equal in the eyes of God. James  says gt If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture You shall love your neighbor as yourself you are doing well. But if you show partiality you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. For he who said Do not commit adultery also said Do not murder. If you do not commit adultery but do murder you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.I think to God to commit any sin is to break His law no matter how big or small. I think we perceive some sins as bigger or smaller depending on our social context. Here in the American South where I live almost everyone is obese. We dont really view Gluttony as all that bad and it hardly crosses any of our minds at all and Im willing to say theres probably very few people around me that have repented of or asked forgiveness for the sin of Gluttony. It still doesnt take away from the fact that Gluttony is a sin. However you may go somewhere else in the world and find Gluttony as a very serious offense.Also if some sins are greater or smaller than others it leaves room to boast. I could very well say Im not as bad as Adolph Hitler. The fact is though that I am. In the eyes of the Law we both are not good. The Bible says There is none good no not one. In a social context though people would say that Adolph Hitler was the most evil man in existence. However to God I am just as wretched a man as Adolph Hitler was. He didnt elect me due to anything Ive done or because Im a better person or anything. In the eyes of the Law both I and Adolph Hitler deserve Hell.

11126066,0,t1_des9mpm,First in the context of your discussion with Mr. cbrad here I definitely agree with you it does seem like the offensiveness of our speech must surely transcend authorial intent.On the other hand Im interested in your thoughts as to how far this can really be taken. Should films refrain from using the word confusticate solely because some extraordinarily scupulous elderly woman in Idaho finds it offensive? On one hand it seems sensible that we should understand that our words really can be offensive even if we intended to convey no ill will or to cause offense to deny this would be to deny the reality that it really is possible to say awful horrible things out of sheer insensitivity to the feelings of others around us. But while the Speaker isnt the final arbiter of offensive language it doesnt seem like that power rests solely in the Listener either.We might try to appeal to Scripture to stand as our objective yardstick for measuring the offense of a word but then Scripture doesnt say much explicitly on the subject as it relates to Hebrew words let alone English vocabulary. We know that Scripture forbids corrupting talk and coarse joking for example and exhorts us to let our speech be seasoned with salt and to only speak such that it is useful for building others up but on the surface it doesnt really seem to present a category for words that grounded in their meaning themselves are inherently offsensive.I dunno what are your thoughts?

11149793,0,t1_devlb2w,gtYoure totally misunderstanding both the Second Commandment and Deuteronomy . gtgtThe Second Commandment contains two imperatives gtgt Do Not Make Images of Godgt Do Not Worship ImagesgtgtMoses explains in Deuteronomy  the meaning of the Second Commandment God has no image for us to make. So dont make them. And dont bow down to them. gtgtFrom my paper on the Golden Calf incident of Exod  gtgtgt The Second however contains two aspects. First the Israelites are forbidden from crafting for themselves an image Heb   . The term  is defined as an idol and comes from a verb meaning to hew into shape or even to carve wood or stone. The implication of this command is drawn out by Moses is Deut  where he restates the command and warns Israel not to break it because they saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at Horeb . gtgtgtThe second aspect of the Second Commandment is a second imperative  You shall not bow down. This second imperative indicates a distinction of the two aspects Israel is to neither craft an image of Yahweh nor are they to bow down to them. Hence Moses further explanation in Deut  And beware lest you raise your eyes to heaven and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars all the host of heaven you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. We can see immediately the lest in Deut  signifies the distinction of the two. You shall not make for yourself becomes distinct from You shall not bow down to them or serve them making then the two imperatives linked with regards to content but not necessarily with regards to action. gt It is deformed theology like this that tends to use many words in obscuring the truth. Here is the relevant passage for convenience.Deuteronomy  KJVSLest ye corrupt yourselves  and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female  The likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air  The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth  And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.We are dead to the law of Moses to be married to Christ who is the end of the law for righteousness.Romans  KJVSKnow ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?  For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband.  So then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man.  Wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God.  For when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.  But now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.Galatians  KJVSO foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you?  This only would I learn of you Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?  Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh?  Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.  He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith?  Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of Abraham.  And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto Abraham saying  In thee shall all nations be blessed.  So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.  For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.  But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for The just shall live by faith.  And the law is not of faith but The man that doeth them shall live in them.  Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree  That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.  Brethren I speak after the manner of men Though it be but a mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto.  Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not And to seeds as of many but as of one And to thy seed which is Christ.  And this I say that the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect.  For if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise.  Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.  Now a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one.  Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law.  But the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.  But before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.  Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith.  But after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  There is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.  And if ye be Christs then are ye Abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise.You err in understanding of the Scriptures. You seem yourself religious and think as though you observance of the law which is unto death to avail you in some sense of holiness or righteousness. If you do the Scriptures themselves negate such a haughty presumption.Hebrews  KJVSFor by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.Those for whom Christs death has been imputed walk in newness of life. They have been perfected and there is no additional merit that can muster through the deeds of their hands. We that are His grow in grace and knowledge of the LORD Jesus Christ. We learn about His precepts and His wisdom and realize they are good for us. We as we are made to know we ought not give Gods enemies cause to blaspheme we are mindful of our conduct in that regard. This is to counter the Antinomianism charges that I often encounter. We have a new law. It is the law of faith. I have the liberty to create any image I want as long as I do it for the Glory of God. ,Reformed,devtf96,1,t5_2riuy

11335075,0,t1_dfglhjm,As uCiroFlexo has noted the Word is not only with God in creation but he is God himself. gtI dont understand this sentence. A big part of what?The reason that Jesus does everything in his earthly ministry by the power of the Spirit is because he is also demonstrating what it means to live a truly human life.  He is the second Adam and thus demonstrates what it means to live as Adam should have done.  This is why people often think that he is not God but Jesuss own words blatantly deny this conclusion not to mention the words of Paul and the other disciples after Christs Ascension. gt I am Unitarian.As I said in my response to uCiroFlexo Im glad you have finally said this explicitly as it is the main reason behind our disagreement.  If one is Unitarian then of course it does not matter so much to say that God departs from Christ for a time.  There is no Trinity whose relationship would be affected by this.Considering that you are commenting on a Reformed sub whose confession of faith explicitly declares that Christ Himself shared Gods very nature on its sidebar you probably should have prefaced your entire comment series with this point.  It is no small matter.Im really not sure our disagreement extends much beyond that however.  I honestly think that it is an issue caused by our disagreement on the nature of Christ as God.  Since he is God I do not think God can forsake him in any objective way.  You do not think he is God so this is not a huge issue for you to say that he was forsaken.  ,Reformed,dfgt7eg,1,t5_2riuy

While he did not have a statistical majority of controversial posts he had a clear plurality as no other individual user contributed more than one single thread to the Top . Thus each of the other  individuals contributed only  each. Regardless of their controversial nature his  posts generated  comments. The total number of comments on all Top  controversial threads was . Thus . of discussion in controversial threads is started by one individual. So while  individual users were able to generate a combined  comments utanhan by himself generated nearly the same number.  This means that he also wins for perthread average number of comment. On average his threads generate . comments which the average for the other submitters is . comments.  A quick look at the Top  upvoted posts on this sub from the same time period shows only  total comments. So while more controversial utanhans posts do generate more discussion. The average number of comments for the Top  upvoted posts is only . only about . of the average comments for a utanhan thread. Also over the last  months the Challies AMA thread is a clear statistical outlier at  comments. That single thread alone accounted for  of all comments. Remove it and the average number of comments per thread drops to . only about half of a utanhan thread. So whats the takeaway here?

11634008,0,t1_dge86x8,Part Onegt While I think Kierkegaard had some decent oneliners which sound good in isolation I think the whole of his philosophy is dangerous to Christianity.On the contrary the opposite seems true. Kierkegaards oneliners are often badly misconstrued and his philosophy taken as a whole is quite theologically rich. Your portrait of Kierkegaard does not appear to do justice to the whole of his philosophy. See below.gt Being the father of existentialism Kierkegaard is more than the father of existentialism reading him chiefly from that angle tends to be egregiously reductive andin perpetuating misleading associations to superficially similar concepts in later existentialists especially Sartre and Camusit can greatly hinder one from understanding Kierkegaard on his own terms.Although Kierkegaard does discuss many quintessential existentialist themes in his writings such as anxiety despair death authenticity the absurd the herd mentality and the limits of reason he also writes on many themes not typically associated with existentialism such as humor irony language direct vs. indirect communication moral virtue divine vs. human authority the divine attributes faith in God preferential love vs. love as divine command joyful endurance in suffering special providence and the relationship between grace and works.Not only that but there are other important traditions and thinkers in relation to which and to whom Kierkegaard must be understood. For example we should observe Kierkegaards criticism and critical appropriation of the German Romantics of Immanuel Kant of Hegel and the German Idealists and of the theology of Martin Luther. We should also note his high regard for the Pietist tradition especially Johann Arndt and the thought of German thinker Johann Georg Hamann. This takes us well beyond the narrow confines of Kierkegaardasthefatherofexistentialism reading.gt Kierkegaards entire worldview was focused inwardly on personal experience and ultimately subjective faith.While Kierkegaard does focus on individual subjectivity his epistemology is not subjectivist. Indeed only one who has overlooked his treatment of biblical prophetic and ecclesial authorityand misread phrases such as truth is subjectivitycould think otherwise.gt In his philosophical framework there was no way to know for sure that God existed or that Christianity was true. So while he didnt outright deny the truth of Christianity he didnt believe it was defendable either.This is false and a misportrayal of his religious epistemology. One is not either an evidentialist or else a fideist. There is a wide range of epistemologies that reject both fideism on the one hand and classical foundationalism and evidentialism on the other. Some scholars place him toward the middle with Plantinga and Reformed epistemology. In any case Kierkegaard held that one could know God through nature as well as through Gods selfrevelation in Scripture. He rejected the use of rational demonstrations of theism or Christianity. He did not reject knowledge of theism and Christianity.gt To him the only way to accept Christianity or the Bible or God or any religious belief was to make a leap of faith. But importantly his idea of faith does not comport with any classical orthodox Christian understanding of the term. To him faith was by definition irrational.The phrase leap of faith occurs nowhere in his writings and the concept of the leap refers to the category of decisionsomething that applies to the atheist no less than the theist. The idea is that reason alone cannot prove faith. Kierkegaard does not maintain that reason has no role to play in the Christian life only that it does not play a sufficient role.gt His most famous work Fear and Trembling centered around that notion. The crux of Fear and Trembling is the story of Abraham and Isaac. In his analysis Kierkegaard comes to the conclusion that Abrahams actions were irrational and unethical and that this abstract personal leap of faith is the only explanation necessary.None of the words in Fear and Trembling belong to Kierkegaard. They belong to Johannes de Silentio one of Kierkegaards many pseudonyms These pseudonyms are not pen names and their views often do not coincide with Kierkegaards own views. In the case of Fear and Trembling for instance Kierkegaard and de Silentio disagree when it comes to how to interpret the significance of Abraham. Moreover even de Silentio would not claim that Abrahams actions were simply unethical but only unethical in relation to social morality. In short de Silentio is not employing just any concept of the ethical but has in mind Hegels Sittlichkeit. Now if you want Kierkegaards own ethics better to read his signed piece Works of Love than Fear and Trembling. Alongside this I would recommend reading Kierkegaards Ethic of Love by C. Stephen Evans and Loves Grateful Striving by M. Jamie Ferreira.,Reformed,dgeq72t,7,t5_2riuy
