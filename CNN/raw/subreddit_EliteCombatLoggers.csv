7424955,0,t1_d2m5lef,Thx for your reply. Im not afraid of being killed but there needs to be some balance why should I let myself be killed by some asshole cmdr on my friendslist the one thing I didnt expected. To get to the M ranges takes a lot of effort I did a lot of exploring im more explorer then fighter indeed.So in effect its better to not be seen in Eravate when I play in open because AA keeps hunting keeps reporting im sure of it   ... in order to get my account banned? Something is very wrong with this im sure you see that yourself?Again when AA stops hunting me there is no need for me kill clients or whatever and a normal interdiction and fight really no problem... I lost enough won a few ... but again when AA players make friends with relative new players in order to kill them off later ... come on. ,EliteCombatLoggers,d2m63m0,-1,t5_376mh

7612074,0,t1_d37g4pu,yet they do have proof dont they? the video above AND your confession above? and now they already know what you messaged me when I asked you if you had done it that you had no choice... Lunar Tick you cant say those things and then claim to never have said them. it doesnt work that way.,EliteCombatLoggers,d37gbia,2,t5_376mh
