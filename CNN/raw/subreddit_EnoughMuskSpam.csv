9399103,0,t1_d978csb,I really want this sub to be about fair criticism of elonhis companies and circlejerking about blind fanboyism not just bashing of elon.,EnoughMuskSpam,d97ehn0,3,t5_3blr7
9490042,0,t1_d9itn0q,gt Dont just focus on one side of the balanceLol the exact the same thing should be said for the weak personalities of reddit elevating this guy like hes a god or something  they too focus only on one side of the balance  also Iam convinced that many people in rfuturology and rspace are getting paid to shill musk and his companies....so my advise is only one  stop listening to PR  if you want to save the environment look at yourself and what you can do  not buy into this environmental messiah  stop eating meat and buying stuff that you dont need like new clothes every month....I know thats not as glamorus as elon musk global  weekly pr stunts  but it is surely more effective,EnoughMuskSpam,d9iumro,2,t5_3blr7

10253793,0,t1_dc689y5,Standardized but not standard. Same with networks. Nobody many made the effort to build a good enough network that Tesla would say it fits their customers needs. Especially not car manufacturers thats a big part why nobody can outperform Tesla in long range vehicles.  As for RampD the equipment has some electronics and remote monitoring capabilities too.  ,EnoughMuskSpam,dc6bnnp,1,t5_3blr7

11008813,0,t1_defnm0q,No earth based colony is safe from a global event by definition.A truly self sufficient colony off planet would be.The Antarctic would be fine as a testbed but it doesnt solve the issue.And its not just out life timespan we have to think about but all the lives that come after us.Too get to the far future you need to survive through the present.And yes youre right Tesla at the very least its forcing change in a stale industry that was unwilling to move on from fossil fuels at an great rate.,EnoughMuskSpam,deftgtx,2,t5_3blr7
11416917,0,t1_dfpsmkc,Yeah professional investors that have pumped up this company are relying upon the greed and arrogance of individuals to follow suit. Thats the kind of people this company is designed to attract people who will believe promises even when they are repeatedly broken. ,EnoughMuskSpam,dfq3gpi,2,t5_3blr7
