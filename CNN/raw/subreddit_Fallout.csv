40069,0,t3_1ujoft,Im gonna go with the unpopular opinion here and say the Legion. First lets look at Benny Before the Courier shows up Benny appears to have the best hand. But if left to his own devices what does Benny achieve? Getting caught by the Legion at the Fort and probably a crucifixion would follow. House would then have no champion to go in to the Fort and activate the army as the Courier had receive a special invitation by Caesar something I dont see anyone else in the Mojave achieving. House would most likely then put his support behind the NCR as the preferable alternative to a Legion victory. So what we have is the Legion vs the NCR at this point but through playing the game we can see that not only is the NCR spread pretty thin but theyre also going into battle with a pretty flimsy plan at best. Even if the Legion is outmatched at Hoover Dam all they would need to do is sabotage the whole place while the NCR is throwing troops at the camp like lemmings. If the dam is rendered inoperable it would not only demoralize New Vegas but also take away what House and the NCR is fighting over Power. Power for the strip and military bases to fortify New Vegas. So if the Legion lost the second battle at Hoover Dam I could see them capturing it in a third after the NCR almost completely loses all support in their endeavor to hold New Vegas.,Fallout,ceizqz4,2,t5_2qnzu

Talk to everyone you can find and theres bound to be someone who wants something doing. Im always surprised by how BIG some of the towns are. Crimson Caravan seem to offer runs to cities which often involve fending off attackers and the like  which is moneyxpgetting to different towns.Honestly I get a lot of free xp through dialogue and hacking because I spec science and speech  I like a char who can talk or tech her way around things. You also earn xp reading things to do with lore I cant remember if skill books give you xp as well as skill points though... I know The Brotherhood bunker let me ding just through nattering at people about history and info  and then THEY pointed me to computers which gave me more xp etc... and there are computers that still work inside certain vaults that give xp too.If you think you can handle one Deathclaws are worth a ridiculous amount of xp and theres alot around the Warehouses in the Boneyard.

Ill be the Infiltrator since House wants to meet with me again Lets say this is after first meeting him and he has given me the Presidential suite. Yes Man. Hell be the Mission control. He has information about House. Hell also make sure that house doesnt notice when his securitrons are taken offline.. Lily The thief. Shell be hiding out of sight using her new Stealth Boy and will be the one to steal the targets..  Miss.Fortune The Distraction. Shell be shooting everyone stealthily with her gun creating multiple accidents which completely throw everyone into chaos down on the Strip. House should notice and not pay attention.. Dr.OZero The Bruiser. The good Doctor is pretty much a walking techbane perfect for dealing with Securitrons.I actually think that thats enough.Goal Houses....snow globes. Im not kidding.History My family used to live on the Strip. When my father found a snowglobe on the Strip House made an ultimatum. Give it or get kicked off the Strip. Thinking that the Snowglobe must be important my Father refused to give it and House kicked us out into Freeside. Now as a courier finally getting to see house Again ill steal all his precious Snow Globes so that I can have the last laugh.Note The Globes will be hidden in Houses secret little area but not actually in the basement.Stage  Lily and I Meet in the Presidential suite which House has no problems with. Yes Man loops the security feed on the cameras and Lily Uses her stealth boy. I then walk into the elevator and Lily follows.Stage  Miss Fortune starts by shooting a Securitron on the strip potentially causing some disaster ranging from it becoming aggressive to other securitrons to its missiles in its shoulders spontaneously exploding. Houses attention is focused on the Strip.Stage  Walk out of the elevator on Houses floor with Lily still Stealthed.  floats into the casino having already disabled Victor. House doesnt notice since Yes man is still screwing with his systems. He uses one of his mechanical arms to go up to the Penthouse.Stage  Stand in front of house waiting while  destroys the Terminal controlling the entrance to Houses secret chamber. Lily sneaks in and steals it.  heads back outside.Stage  By this point Miss Fortune has stopped leaving everyone confused. House sticks around a bit before heading back into his main computer.Stage  Lily has already snuck out with all the snowglobes and I talk with House about the Chip. Then he sends me off and Lily goes with me to leave.Heist Name The House Divided shall fall.,Fallout,ceuwygj,9,t5_2qnzu

In Church Latin it is ideally ave and in English it tends to be pronounced ve.gtThe term was notably used to greet the Caesar or other authorities. Suetonius recorded that on one occasion naumachiarii and criminals fated to die fighting during mock naval encountersaddressed Caesar with the words Ave Caesar! Morituri te salutant! Hail Caesar!

435129,0,t3_1z2807,I dont have plot ideas for you but my biggest recommendation is to brush up on your fallout knowledge. Keep it lore friendly if possible. A great way to do this is read the fallout timeline and open articles  on it that interest you.Aside from that make sure your writing structure is on par. Even if you are good at writing it cant hurt to look up how to write with proper structure. I find a lot of people struggle with the correct way of doing conversations in their writing. I learned a lot from many sources when I started writing my first novel and I was quite surprised to find out how many things I was doing wrong that I thought were correct.If you want to catch everyone in with writing do similar to Veronicas Date and use characters we know so long as you can capture their personality well. No one wants to read a character they know and love and not feel them in the writing. If you want to capture a more fallout related crowd feel free to make your own characters but keep a lot of connections to the wastelands we know. Make sure to reference companies items locations weapons name brands and anything else you can imagine in the process.Sorry that this isnt a plot idea of what to write but hopefully it gives you some ideas of where to take it when you do have one. I am always open to fact checking lore  canon for people writing fan fiction for Fallout if the writing is done well. Feel free to PM me if you would want something like that. Good luck!,Fallout,cfpv6sp,3,t5_2qnzu

450771,0,t3_1z8kfk,Really no specific chronological order since their respective stories are each individual for the most part. No requirements for any of them either except for Broken Steel which requires you to beat the main base story though obviously although some require much more skill than others. In my opinion though I think its best to do them as follows The Pitt can be done at a relatively early level and you get access to the ammo press which will prove to be incredibly helpful throughout your wasteland journeys then Point Lookout at least level  or youre gonna have a bad time then Op. Anchorage simulation but your skills do come along with you and then Broken Steel extension of main story. Id do Mothership Zeta dead last since its the worst of the bunch imo. Still a good DLC just not any better than any of the others.,Fallout,cfri1l4,3,t5_2qnzu

754307,0,t3_22rz59,Ive come to conclusion that the reason that Fallout is a much more immersing experience compared to Skyrim due to a lot of reasons. The first part is the general environment you have to deal with. In Fallout you are a survivor you try to endure the wasteland and try to become powerful but not immortal. There are rarely safe places in Fallout to go to and the difficulty of leveling up and trying to become powerful is an uphill battle.The quests are fun to do because they have consequences and a lot more to do with its lore and more inbound of what you the character is doing. You can wreak havoc be kind and see what your difference makes. Then as a whole the fallout series has a certain aura about it that makes it more enjoyable than elder scrolls. You have a very interesting lore that isnt dragged down by overused medieval warfare scripts or whatnot. And the clash of s with a post apocalyptic war zone is to die for. And when it comes to the rpg elements everything revolving about leveling up starting your character and weaponsabilities is so much more awesome than Skyrim. You might think that adding magic and dragonshouts would really increase the popularity of Skyrim but it isnt as fun as the weapons showcased in the Fallout at its full capabilities. ,Fallout,cgq0s3f,2,t5_2qnzu

And I dont give a damn about New Vegas metacritic score. Most reviewers had a negative outlook on the game at release just because of trivial problems like bugs which are the least of problems when compared to things that should be present such as atmosphere art direction story etc. Had they done a better job by focusing less on the bugs and more on pure content which many agree exceeds that of  in quality Fallout New Vegas would have received the score it deserves something similar to s or better.,Fallout,cgs756u,3,t5_2qnzu

1003366,0,t3_25gptr,Honest Hearts was a lot of fun and a good starting DLC. Play this one first.Personally I HATED Dead Money just because the atmosphere made me want to crawl into a ball cry and play some Viva Pinata. Also it doesnt really connect a lot with the other DLCs so you dont even have to play it if you dont want to. Play this either second or not at all.I had very mixed feelings for Old World Blues. Sometimes I found the story really captivating but other times I thought the whole DLC seemed very poorly executed. It was still fun and you get a ton of loot but dont expect it to be easy either. Some of the guns you get I still have and use. Make sure you play this BEFORE Lonesome Road. It will help make sense of the couriers whole story if you do. Lonesome road was one of the best expansions Ive ever played. The story was insane and made it seem like it wasnt even Fallout sometimes but a cool twisted version of it. The gameplay was great and it wasnt too hard or easy. There we a ton of side quests and stories that you could discover too. This DLC concludes the story from the main game that was continued on OWB. ,Fallout,chic9up,0,t5_2qnzu

I have started playing Fallout  and will say the UI turned me off to that game the first time but if you can stick it out the first game is a blast. However i still insist play the new ones first.

1147145,0,t3_27918i,I suppose Im in the minority here but Ive played all of the FO games in the order of their release and FO is my favorite game in the series by far. I felt a few ticks about the lore but I expected it to be different after so much time and a new company. I certainly wouldnt go so far as to call it blasphemy as I was happy to be playing a new fallout and ecstatic at how great it was. Lets not forget that if it wasnt for Bethesda and Fallout  the series would have ended on the abysmal BOS game which WAS blasphemy. FO is the highestselling game in the history of the seriesblowing the originals out of the water and selling literally over a million copies more than NV. We got NV because FO was awesome and every future fallout game we ever play will also only exist because fallout  was awesome. I loved NV as well and feel that the lore was better represented but I was quite disappointed in  the towns. The Strip was a huge letdown and literally all of the other towns were boring compared to Megaton Rivet City Paradise Falls Little Lamplight and even Tenpenny Tower was more interesting than most of the towns in NV and its not even a town just a tower.,Fallout,chyo09t,2,t5_2qnzu

It exits the building through the window and enters the house across the street. Its a firefighter building and it the eyebot goes down the steps. It sees a BOS member with a Fat Man. Its walking down the street. And you never see its face only birds eye view and view from a rad roach or  in the alley. Then the Brotherhood of Steel Member looks at a pile of cars blocking the street. The song stops and echos like in Fallout . A couple of the cars have the headlights flicker and then out of nowhere a Nuka Cola trucker flys from the pile breaking a building and letting Nuka Cola crates escape from the trailer. There is brief silences and you see the BOS member aim his Fat Man. A Super Mutant Behemoth emerges from the bottom of the pile making some cars fly from the pile. The monster screams at the BOS member and then he launches the Mini Nuke into the Super Mutant Behemoths mouth. You see a close up of the BOS members helmet and see the explosion of blood and gore and fire in the eyes. Then the war never changes speech goes on.

1197448,0,t1_ci4b7p1,. short doesnt mean its childish. Actually now when most gamers are getting older and have less time playing games so they prefer playing shorter games so you could say that it was made with a more mature audience in mind.. as far as i know encouraging creativity or being unbalanced doesnt mean the game is childish. Thats what id call fun gameplay. I wish i could do something that creative in Elder Scrolls games. I dont really know if they break the game because they take so much mana and dishonoreds mana system encourages to not spam abilities. And again even if they do i still dont think being unbalanced is childis. One of my favorite RPGs ever Arcanum  Of steamworks and magick obscura is notorious for being unbalanced and easily exploited but it is most definitely not a childish game. I agree i actually wish it was more action like the game arkane made before it dark messiah which i actually like better but i still dont think there is anything childish in that.well damn i already wrote those as a read your post so im gonna leave them there anyway.. You do know that newer bethsoft games are infamous for being very dumbed down and handholding with all the quest markers linear dungeons streamlined skills and such. And all they do is make open world sandbox games which is exaclty what most AAA devs like Ubisoft do nowadays expect bethesda games always have their own flaws which they never seem to be able to fix such as bad combat and linear quests. To me it seems like you dont even know what childish means an unbalanced game with somewhat generic gameplay that allows you to be creative is not childish something like Fables colorful exaggerated fairytale esque artstyle is childish or biowares romances because theyre basically what teenagers think relationships are like.,Fallout,ci4bxrg,1,t5_2qnzu

Its not openworld to the same degree that TESFallout is there are about  really large levels that all link to a few other levels and you can traverse them freely with no real restrictions on your movement but its not the same sort of situation where you can see the other end of the world from a vantage point. There are tons of questgivers as well but only  of them really offer missions with the same kinds of depth and complexity as Fallout so again the game is a little more linear.Despite this I very highly recommend the game its incredibly atmospheric and overall just a very good experience and quite modfriendly.

1367935,1,t1_cinpwzy,I completely disagree with you. I think it would be an amazing change of pace and I hate when people like you say it would suck.Why the fuck would I keep playing Fallout if every game is the same factions with the same guns and the same enemies but in a different region of North America.I can agree that world building is important but changing the locale isnt throwing it away! Its still there! Fallout NV wont suddenly not exist if they make a game in England! This is exactly what the only gripe I have with Fallout  and NV is. THEY ARE PRACTICALLY THE EXACT SAME GAME. They didnt change anything beyond minor tweaks in mechanics. I HOPE that the next Fallout game has a newer engine that makes it look like a shiny new game not the same game in a desert instead of DC.And what do you mean why even call it Fallout. Did you play Bioshock Infinite? It is a completely different world different area different enemies different weapons and mechanics and HOLY SHIT they still stayed true to the Bioshock franchise name. I really do not want this series to take the route CoD took because we all know what that looks like. And we can already see them taking that route like I said  and NV are pretty much the exact same game. I have trust in Bethesda that the next Fallout game wont be like that though. Remember the first time you played Fallout? Remember meetinghearing about The Brotherhood of Steel and seeing these dudes in huge power armor with insane energy weapons and thinking Holy fuck who are these people what is there deal and how the hell do I get one of those weaponsarmor. That didnt happen to me with NV because I already knew about them. I know about the Brotherhood and the Followers of the Apocalypse and the Radroaches. I want there to be different factions. I want to be completely thrown of guard when I hear about whoever they are what their purposes are and whether or not they are gonna blow my head off when I run into them.

1408072,0,t1_cisq7vd,Its only harder if youre stupidreckless about it. If you follow the story lineexplore the areas around the towns on main roads the enemies are a joke. Trust me Ive played both  and NV multiple times. Deathclaws are in both so using that as an argument is pointless. Cazadors as I have already said are incredibly easy if you shoot off their wings which isnt all that hard. Fire geckos are more obnoxious than difficult. Nothing in that game is difficult if youre properly levelled. You can pretty much beat the entirety of New Vegas with a mm unmodded pistol and a rebar club provided youre levelled enough. Fallout  scales everything so no matter how high your level everything else is going to be strong in proportion to you.Additionally NV projectile vomits ammo at you throughout the entire game. I have a much harder time keeping stocked in . In my current NV playthrough Im in Novac with over  mm  or so . easily  for whatever the Varmint Rifle uses. Not to mention a freaking machete could get you to Novac on your own.Im not saying NV is bad. I actually think its more fun. Its just definitely not as dangerous. More unforgiving if you wander into the wrong area? Maybe sure.

1426951,0,t1_ciucq5p,I will say Bethesdas deserving of some points for the pure strength of their ideas.  They may not always be well thoughtout ideas or terribly deep ideas but they fuckin commit to what they do.  The fact that they waffled and eventually changed horses midstream on when the game was set is able to account for a lot of the weirdness that you mentioned but one thing Id like to add on to your criticism of  specifically is the loss of gravitas.As much as I love the insanity of a NukaColaobsessed fan and a society devoted to a treeman it feels weird that its all taken so lightly.  That sort of madness was much more a source of dark humor in the originals and it feels cheap to play it for laughs without focusing on how terrifyingly goddamn crazy someone who thinks theyre a reallife vampire is.  I cant imagine Tycho or Ian or Marcus or Vic or... well anyone from Fallout  or  really ever setting foot within a hundred miles of Megaton okay maybe Marcus but yknow... super mutant.  It felt like Fallout  was more of a merry romp through postapocalyptia punctuated with the rare moment of Arefu or Andale.  Signal Oscar Zulu was a great intro to Fallouts tone I just wish it had lasted more than an hour before Moira was making cutesy voices about a fate that the Brotherhood of Steel sent idiots into because they were too afraid to face that horrific death themselves.,Fallout,civ597v,2,t5_2qnzu

1441953,0,t3_2anrpj,The DLC stories reference each other and provide a large story arch. Honest Hearts and Dead Money are often underrated. The former is immensely satisfying if you take your time but its main questline feels unnaturally quick and isnt paced well. But whats there is done well in portraying a conflict between more primitive tribes and the outsiders who have a stake in their future. Theres also a very nice and sentimental side story that provides background to the current state of affairs in Zion but also is remarkable in its own right. Once you leave the area for Dead Money you cant come back. This is the most important thing for players who want to find certain weapon mods skill books etc. The challenge is far greater when playing Dead Money on Hardcore and theres a special effect in the DLC for those who do. The storytelling in DM is done better than in HH. HHs did not pace well whereas DMs does and is intriguing in its own respect although HHs concept and style are interesting too. Old World Blues harkens back to the sci fi ideals of the s and earlier and does so with touches of humor and eccentricity seldom found in todays media as youve probably seen. I recommend completing it rd after DM or HH. Finally regardless of earlier order Lonesome Road should be done last to bring finality to the DLC story arch. ,Fallout,cix0wqj,1,t5_2qnzu

Plus Mad Max had a hell of a lot of guns in Thunderdome so why only use melee? You can still role play without doing things exactly because this is not the same universe just feel like you have the essence of the character in the dialogue and choices.The thing is although inspired by MadMax Fallout is not. In MadMax ammo was rare because they were in the Australian outback. Fallout is in the heart of a americanabased satire the likes of Robocop. Guns are everywhere and so is ammo.

He travels around fixing peoples problems one such being saving the leader of Shady Sands daughter. Eventually he makes his way to Bakersfield where he finds a town run by zombies ghouls and a new kind of creature called SuperMutants guarding the watersource for the town. Super Mutants are big green and mostly stupid but armed to the teeth with powerful military ordnance. After clearing the Water source he finds the chip and heads back to his Vault. After writing a report for the overseer hes told that he needs to go out once more to destroy the Mutants leader and the source of the mutants or else they will take over the world. The Vault Dweller travels to a massive Cathedral in Los Angeles where he finds a cult that sees mutants as ascendants. He sneaks or fights his way to the depths of the cathedrals and finds a grotesque mutated man who looks like a lump of flesh combined with a computer. This is the Master god of the mutants. The Vault Dweller either fights the master or manages to prove that mutants are sterile therefore turning the whole world into mutants will actually put an end to humanity rather than elevate it to a new era. The wanderer then heads north and destroys the factory that makes mutants. He returns to Vault  a hero but is told that he has to leave because if he returns others might try to leave the vault. The Overseer is who did not allow the Vault Dweller to return is either executed by the Vault Dweller or sentenced to death by the people of the Vault.In Fallout  It has been  years since Fallout. The Vault Dweller and some people from Vault  moved north into Oregon settled down and became tribal technologically culturally and linguistically regressing  years in a mere . The grandson of the Vault Dweller is told that the village is dying. Crops are not growing animals are dying children are sick. To fix this he has been deemed the Chosen One of his village and must find a device called the GECK from Vault  that will fix their problems and turn their tribe into a city. However the location of the Vault has been lost to the tribe despite that their ancestors came from there not even  years ago. So Chosen needs to find a trader named Vic that is being held captive by slavers Vic has been trading equipment from Vault  to the tribe. After Vic is freed he gives the Chosen a hint to where the Vault is but instead Chosen finds Vault  which has used a GECK to turn into a city. After a bunch of searching Chosen ends up in NCR which used to be Shady Sands back in Fallout and is now run by the Daughter of the previous leader Tandi who was saved by the Vault Dweller. Using more clues Chosen finds the GECK in Vault  which is now being administrated by talking Deathclaws. Chosen returns to his village only to find it razed to the ground. All of its people have been kidnapped by remnants of the American Government called the Enclave. Chosen finds out that they are running their operation off an Oil rig off the coast of California and goes to San Francisco to repair an oil tanker so that he can reach the facility. On the Oil Rig Chosen meets the President of the US and finds out that the Enclaves plan is to use an aerosol of modified FEV what creates SuperMutants to kill all living things on the shore. The Enclave believes that they are pure humans and anyone living on the mainland who is not locked in a Vault is a mutated nearhuman and needs to be killed. One way or another Chosen manages to activate the Oil Rigs selfdestruct and free his tribe and those from Vault . But before he leaves he has to fight a Secret Service agent called Frank Horrigan who is a ft tall supermutant in power armor. Once Horrigan is dead Chosen leaves the oil rig with his family and cousins and returns to his village where they use the GECK to transform the tribe into a city. And thats a basic synopsis with little extra fluff of the main storyAs for your playstyle its up to you. Think about what kind of character you want and play multiple times to get the full experience. However remember that combat is an integral part of the game and its very difficult to roleplay as a brainiac or pacifist. ,Fallout,cjgwoqc,2,t5_2qnzu

Since the materials above this water reservoir were reaching temperatures of C it could have burned through the outer layers of the reactors and entered the water resulting in a massive steam explosion and would have released a lot of radioactivity. To stop this from happening they had to drain the water in the reservoir via a set of valves. In order to turn these valves a group of  volunteers in diving suits entered the radioactive waters to turn the valves.

1660753,1,t3_2dc96n,I love FO for several reasons it was my first Fallout game so of course the game that gave me knowledge of the series gets a few extra points the introduction was genius your character is a sheltered child for  years of his life the sudden jolt of chaos in the vault the fight to escape and find your father and the introduction to the wasteland was one of the greatest experiences in the game. the deep writing in the game was amazing the story telling and the parallels contrasts that were created were so seamless and really made me realize how good a video game can be storywise. the concepts were all very easy to pick up unlike other fallouts everything was simple to understand and picking up the game was easier comparatively. i feel like its the most friendly with a pretty good learning curve. Dad simple as that. James hands down has been the character ive cared about most in any game ive ever played. something about him just makes him so memorable be it his cause how you can almost feel the sense of loss in his voice even after all those years he was gone how he single handedly took on an entire raider camp on his way back to rivet city. he was just all around perfect.little bits add to it here and there but those are what keep me coming back to it. Even after playing NV for a good chunk and enjoying it FO is still the game that I feel captures a lot about Fallout.,Fallout,cjoi0yb,-1,t5_2qnzu

The enemies are tough but not in a fun or challenging way. You just end up stabbingshooting them a hundred times before they finally go down. The villa part of the DLC is a confusing maze which just ends up being frustrating. The bomb collar starts off as an interesting challenge but ends up becoming very video gamey. I think if the villa section was a lot shorter I would have liked it more it just ends up dragging on for too long and sucking the life out of me.Overall its something I looked back on fondly but didnt enjoy playing. ,Fallout,cjun38d,3,t5_2qnzu

1737127,0,t3_2ec6lt,Maam I think you left your Stealth Boy on...  Its never explicitly stated but yes there are supernatural things in the Fallout universe. Much like how space aliens are treated its not quite in your face but you will eventually come across some things hinting towards the paranormal. Chalk it up to special encounters with monster footprints the size of buses or silly Traits like Wild Wasteland but these things are out there. Take the graves in Fallout New Vegas for example. Turn up your volume enough and stand right next to one and you can hear ghostly whispers emanating from them.  And what about this little scamp Yeah he could be some mentally deranged waster child looking to make a buck or maybe he legitimately has the ability to read minds and feel supernatural feelings. How else would he canonically say such accurate information? Plus he isnt even the only one Poplar the Treeminder also uses paranormal abilities to see into the future and to see things without actually being there.  Hell just look at The Master He has the ability to communicate with massive amounts of people over any distance instantly. He was able to amass an army of devote followers who did whatever he willed from a single room. While you might think this is because of some amazing prewar Vault technology it is simply not. It is the abilities of a brain that has endured dangerous strains of FEV and they have proven that telekinesis and psionic powers can exist. Maybe such powers are related to the doors opening and closing and the hallucinations you get in the Dunwich building? Wouldnt be the first time psionics have caused Fallout players a lot of grief. Do you remember that Headache Medicine The Forecaster always wore on his head to protect him? If worn in Fallout it protects you from some of The Masters worst abilities  There is a lot of supernatural shit in all of the Fallout titles but these things are what I can think of off the top of my head. Theyre always creepy and mysterious and most of the time require you going well off the beaten trail to uncover. Very interesting stuff.,Fallout,cjy4nn3,35,t5_2qnzu

While these experiments were done by the government Enclave FEV tests werent carried out until after the events of Fallout .After assuming control of the base and having his open broadcast of mutiny not get a reply Maxson knew shit was about to hit the fan. He brought the families of his soldiers inside the base for protection and two days later the bombs dropped. He then led these survivors to Lost Hills and eventually formed the Brotherhood.tldr Brotherhood was founded by US soldiers it is not an offshoot of the Enclave.

You cant contact other people with PIPBoys. In fact who would contact him and why? Also how is this even a bad thing?  Secondly the first contact that the Courier has with the Brotherhood happens well after he was shot in the head. Perhaps he met some of the Brotherhood back in Cali and then migrated east but its still a bit of a stretch. If anything at that point the Lone Wanderer would most identify with the New California Republic since their values are most in line with the Lyons Pride BOS.

1912588,0,t1_ckjlw0t,Dont feel dumb to ask questions!  Anyone can learn how to mod one up it just takes time the right tools and being patient. What most people do is get a casting of the LE PipBoy clock released with the Survivor Edition and mod it for their needs  some things are important to consider like screen size how much room you need inside for your electronics set up etc. So first Id figure out what you want working inside some just want a static light some want to fit a fancier system in there. Here are some pics of Allens own build like trimming a cast painting adding a hinge There are ton of folks who can do castings. If youre lucky and can hunt down a Survivor Edition clock yourself you can even mod the clock directly or moldpull a few casts yourself to experiment with different finishing methods. You can D print it if you have the resources! Here is a FREE D file you can use. I believe a girlstudio offers D printed PipBoy kit but folks on prop maker boards say she takes peoples money and runs so buyer beware.  The Instructable I linked also has a very detailed guide on doing finishing work!  Allen plans to make a guide on how he does it but he hasnt finished taking all the WIP pics.I can direct you to  people who do the raw casts if you want to shop around yourself if you shoot me a PM.  If you go on YouTube and plug in PipBoy  you can find different builds people do. I think PipBoys are just as unique as the folks who want one  if you ever need extended advice on what you want to do ask away!,Fallout,ckjnkon,1,t5_2qnzu

2147344,0,t1_clcrsvq,There are way more places but how many of them actually hold anything of interest? Again I love New Vegas I like it way more than  at this point but exploration was not a strong point. I remember playing  for hours and hours and hours not getting a single quest done because I saw a building and asked Ooh what is in there? And then I would come out and see another building and go Ooh I have to explore that. And beyond just random buildings exploring D.C. was incredibly fun because you are seeing a vision of something real but blown up. Seeing the Washington Monument Lincoln Memorial Capitol Building etc. in tatters is far more interesting to me than seeing NCR Station Charlie because it is real I know what it is and seeing it in a postapocalyptic fashion is really just cool. Also the fictional places were more interesting as well. Rivet City is a damn boat Megaton is built out of rust around a nuclear bomb TenPenny Tower is a skyscraper in the middle of nothing. These places are crazy unique when you compare them to Goodsprings  tiny town Primm  couple of casinos and of course New Vegas  shocker casinos.

It all happened so fast. bit these past few days have been even worse. Let me start earlier. My name is not important only that I get this message out so that history may be known one day if anything ever gets back to normal. I had just been paid and was heading to the diner when I felt the first shockwave. I saw a huge mushroom cloud off in the distance towards the capital. I knew it had finally happened but I didnt want to believe it. I had to get out of there. I ran down the street frantically not knowing where to go until I saw one those Polowski Preservation things. I dumped some coins in and stepped in. The door slammed shut. I just stood there hearing the bombs go off for what seemed like days.When the noise finally stopped I got the courage to step out. Buildings on fire and cracks in the ground with hills and valleys and mountains I had never seen before. Scattered here and there were the bodies of the innocent victims of war. After that I wandered the city looking for survivors but found none. Then it started to rain. It wasnt a normal raining though the rain was painful and searing. I sat in a burned out bus for four days while it rained black rain that killed everything in its path. Plants and animals both were reduced to few. After the rain stopped not much has changed yet. Just a lot of dead stuff and me. Food is scarce and fresh water is not existent... Ive also started to develop a weird rash on my face.,Fallout,clpfzmd,1,t5_2qnzu

Bad for tourists good for exploration.There is also a swamp in the middle of the city with wildly aggressive geese thats right Im lookin at you Fens!Fenway The Commons and the schools make for recognizable contemporary landmarks. Old North Church the Commons Faneuil Hall the Harbor and the Capitol building for more historical landmarks.As for the accent that everyone associates with Boston thats Southie accent.

2359008,0,t3_2mb589,Some behindthescenes truth about this project from Facepunch forums from one of the teams original members. People there were initially enthusiastic about the project but he felt he had to post a reply to let them know whats actually going on behind the videos and nice concept art.FYI the projects all smoke and mirrors.Me and a friend were part of the team early on after it became a thing I was a mapper he was the lead designer. but then there was tension between him and the project lead because he was questioning some of their creative choices the plots basically just The Magnificent Seven with an ersatz NCRLegion conflict and the team was just obsessed with making every character a woman if possible for the sake of being progressive. One day he decided to vent some frustrations about the issues with the project to the editor in confidence who proceeded to snitch the entire conversation to the project lead. Despite it being actual critique my friend for the boot for asking questions. Of course since he was the lead designer this kinda fucked over the rate of progress they were making with fleshing out the project Meanwhile the editor got promoted to manager as a reward for telling. You know whats funny? The single map I made is probably the only ingame thing related to this project thats been made since  when it started. Its all just concept art and scenarios  nice looking concepts yeah  but there hasnt been a single game asset made yet. The project lead got a tad pissy when my friend called him out on that and said he was gonna go to the GECK right away to make something... which he never did. I dont even know if its supposed to be a NV mod or a standalone game and I dont even know what engine itd be on.Thats not even mentioning their honestly disrespectful attitude with people with actual technical skills. They just expect people who can map code script etc to just work and do everything they say with zero input  I couldnt even get into an involved discussion about they wanted when I joined to map for them they just dumped a google doc of concepts of me to go copy off. One of the guys in the team who was getting treated like this tried contacting my friend after he got kicked to get his side of the story. The team heard about this and kicked that guy too.Theyre basically riding off the fact theyve got Avellones blessing and theyre trying so so hard to look like legitimate game developers. Im not sure what to think at this point but Im really not gonna be impressed with anything they do until we see an actual game come out of it even if its just a bunch of shitty model renders or a super WIP map.,Fallout,cm3a8bp,10,t5_2qnzu

2387741,0,t3_2mqft9,Well for one knowing the specs of your PC would be helpful. If you are running a multicore system check out the New Vegas multicore fix Secondly youll want the following mods to help with performance To help with texture load order Archive Invalidation New vegas stutter remover Purge cell buffers You already have NVAC gb New vegas will auto detect NVSE Use Loot to sort your mod load order.Thirdly just a bit of advicethoughts regarding the mods you have NMCs Texture pack is not only very performance intensive but can conflict with other textures even when using lootarchive invalidation. This seems to be a common issue with the large and medium texture packs. I just use the small pack as it doesnt cause these problems and still looks good. Project Nevada can be unstable at times I tend not to use large overhaul mods like this such as SkyRe in skyrim as they are good for a while but can cause a lot of mod conflicts etc. Should be fine to use but if you are worried check google Project Nevada FAQtroubleshooting. I would reccoment Fellout amp Nevada Skies over FNV project reality but that is personal preference I guess.  Floral overhaul can conflict with NMCs texture pack I tend to install this after NMCs and tell it to overwrite.  I think EVE can also conflict with NMCs so be sure you have the load order correct. Never used willow so I cannot comment on that.Try running the game after using the suggestions I made and see if it is any stabler. Feel free to ask if you need more help.,Fallout,cm6tza9,4,t5_2qnzu

Who or what could be in Wyoming that grants them such success?gt Plus they really have a great structureWhat great structure? Theyre raiders and always have been. Its part of their identity. Even in the Mojave they raided NCR settlers and took their stuff instead of build and create things for themselves.If they move into Wyoming and it miraculously isnt already taken by some other factions theyll have to transition away from raiding and towards civilization building and Im sure that transition wont be quick or easy.,Fallout,cmkqmnx,3,t5_2qnzu

2501103,0,t3_2o7h2u,Wow thats great man. Like a year ago I started building mothership zeta in mine craft and it actually looks really good but its so much work and Im doing it all by hand in creative but not using the copy past mods so I havent done more than the first two hallwaysjail blocksIn the G.E.C.K. tutorials they mention that each tile on the ground section is the same as the player height which is about equal to  feet tall. Each block in mine craft is a square meter and a meter about equals a yard which equals three feet. This means for super accurate replication building you should look in game and count tiles and build a x square in minecraft for each. If that makes sense? Ill try to find the page that says player height equals ftEDIT found where it says the player is about six feet tall its here in the second text boxgtA good thing to remember while youre getting used to units  the player is  units tall or about six feet.I cant remember where I got that the square floor tiles are the same but when I used that system in minecraft everything has lined up and looked right,Fallout,cml15xt,1,t5_2qnzu

FONV integrated a slight modification to VATS based on the more punishing FOWanderers Edition mod where time is not strictly frozen just somewhat frozen. So in FONV VATS percentages can be wrong enemies can move i.e. go behind cover and completely botch the VATS percentages or in close quarters move at an angle where youre not able to hit them with the direction youre facing at the moment of entering VATS and you can get shot. This was an effort to make VATS slightly less magical and the game more punishing but the resultant inaccurate hit percentages frequently piss players off. ,Fallout,cmulab0,9,t5_2qnzu

2661474,0,t3_2qgjdk,The Rules    There are three columns.    Each column has two stacks of cards one for each player.    Once all three columns have a stack of cards hit  the game will end.    The player who has won the most columns is the winner. A column is won by having the highest stack between .    You can only place cards on a stack in order from highesttolowest or lowesttohighest. Cards of the same suit can be placed regardless of this rule and thus can change the current direction a stack is going.  The Face Cards Jacks will remove a card and Kings will double the value of a card. They can be placed on any card even the opponents. In the thousands of games of Caravan Ive played I have never once used Queens or Jokers. Just ignore them the game is so easy to win any way they will just be wasted cards in your hand.  How to Win Start off your three stacks with either very high or very low numbers. Preferably all s and s. This gives you a lot more flexibility with what cards you can use because you can only count either upwards or downwards. For instance if you start your stack with a  you can only use a  or a . Unless you get two cards in a row that are of the same suit of course.  Next up you need to load up your deck with Jacks and Kings. Im talking  of them. Each. Just spam the fuck out of them. Start a stack with a  amp it up to  with a King remove the opponents  with a Jack make them get rid of the entire stack by Kinging the  after they hit  etc. Its so cheap and it makes this game impossible to lose. Jacks and Kings are the way to go.  How to Make Caps off of Caravan This is a game that is popular among traders and youre going to make bank off of that. All you have to do is find a trader win their money us said money to by their entire stock and then win it back. You will literally make over ten thousand caps PLUS the vendors entire inventory. In the case with Chet from Novac assuming you have the Gun Runners Arsenal That Gun Panancia MF Hyperbreeder all of the new Weapon Mods tons of chems and all of that crazy expensive ammo! you can make roughly fifty thousand caps off of him in the span of ten minutes.  The one thing to note about this is that the game devs knew how overpowered Caravan was so they capped the amount of times you can play with a trader to five. This is still more than enough to win all of their money and stuff however and you get so much money out of it that doing it with ChetJohnson NashLacey should kit out your level  character until the end of the game.,Fallout,cn5zd92,5,t5_2qnzu

Therefore they wouldnt just throw out the window something that they are VERY good at i.e Fallout in Bethesdas case and jump onto making an entirely different kind of game looking at you Evil Within. It just doesnt work. A very generic and unsuccessful game comes out of it. I can name a couple of other different gaming companies and their failed projects but Ill spare you the horrors.Essentially a video game developer needs to recognize two things What their fans really want and whether their strengths coincide with that. If both answers are yes then they are going to get more success and money which results in us putting hundreds of hours in a fresh but familiar game a.k.a Fallout !,Fallout,cojlcs9,1,t5_2qnzu

3184130,0,t1_cortmvq,Er... The New Vegas DLC generally each have their own individual more literary themes with Lonesome Roads having to do both with paying for past actions and with the repetition of history which also plays into OWB with its frozenintime idea and infinity motifs and DM Begin Again which is very ironic when considering what happened in the Divide... These themes are reinforced through both Ulysses dialogue Who are you that do not know your history? and the stories you uncover. Lonesome Road also has some elements of commentary of RPG tropes with the Couriers actions coming back to bite them rather than most RPGs where you just start from nothing however little sense that makes. This is rather like Planescape Torment where you are seeking to discover why your character has no name which is a break from most games where such things are lessthanwellexplained.,Fallout,cos19nr,2,t5_2qnzu

That would tie in well with the story side of things.I would imagine that after her husband is killed and she gives up the business it would either become an abandoned landmark that you made Unsatisfying but very fallout or you could convince somebody else thats its lucrative enough to take over.

As we move closer to the present starting with Vietnam and the Cold War people and culture grow increasingly more cynical. The depiction of the apocalypse becomes a demonstration by reflection than by juxtaposition.In addition coming closer to the present delves into societys more recent memory. The s aesthetic provides a jarring disconnect and a sense of unfamiliarity of a world similar to ours but different in more ways than one.If anything it would achieve a similar effect to go backwards in time like the Roaring s or the Gay Nineties.

3421516,0,t3_2zewlt,Glad you asked. Overall theres not anything REALLY important that has to be seen. But here are a few tips.If you head to Goodsprings cemetery you can find a snow globe next to one of the graves. Why would you want a snow globe? Well lets just after a few more hours in the game you can give them to someone who will pay  caps a globe.On your travels you will eventually reach a town called Novac. You will find someone there named Boone. Boone will give you a quest and if complete certain criteria... you can get him as a companion.Also i would advise against pissing off the legion and NCR until you get further in the game. Cause otherwise they can prove problematic so early on.Thats all i got but since your playing NV for the first time i recommend this guideThats a guide on how to make a really great charcter in New vegas. That youtuber also has guides on weapons in FNV so check those out as well.Also if you are on PC i reccomend the Project Nevada Mod.

Build an entire legend around the guy through radio broadcasts NPC banter and make him this incredibly powerful badass whos essentially impossible to take down until very late in the game forcing the player to flee and survive him whenever he appears.Maybe build an entire quest around him with the possibility to talk with him and make him like you enough to not attack you anymore and eventually join you or do manage to take him down and see your reputation with the faction that hired him go from shunned to feared and have random NPCs acknowledging the accomplishment.

Also theres nothing wrong with using one of the premade characters for your first playthrough. Specifically Narg is an easy character to use at the start of the game because of his proficiency with melee weapons and his exceptional STR and END I would personally recommend replacing Throwing with another more useful skill like Speech or Repair. In fact the manual I linked above even provides a short guide on how to play through the tutorial area on page  right before the hints and tips section.  Its a hard game so dont be upset if you run into trouble especially during the beginning of the game.

Who cares about the slums when it means the Strip gets max power? I figured the Courier probably was one of those little people or born on an NCR outpost somewhere. Or maybe one of the tribes. I just dont see them ok with sacrifice the many for the few as they would have been without the chip one of the many. I guess you could play the Courier as a selfish asshole who as long as they are ok will go along with Houses plans. But in my canon run I figure the Courier would have disabled House not killed him or at least used that  speech skill to fast talk House into not making such coldcalculated decisions. ,Fallout,cpvlvea,1,t5_2qnzu

If you would rather level slowly and progress through the armors at a normal rate I really recommend holding off on it. Its also a great starter for players new to Fallout as you dont need to worry about Weapon Condition or ammo.The Pitt is an alright one nothing in it is very gamebreaking in fact a lot of the weapons you can get in the Pitt can be repaired with earlier game weapons. Id really recommend this as a first.I really wouldnt recommend Zeta at very high levels as I have just completed it at level  and every single alien was covered in this shield that basically made them have Deathclaw health. Otherwise its sort of a side game in that none of its weapons are really usable for prolonged periods of time outside of the DLC Ammo is scarce. Broken Steel can only be done after the main campaign but Id still recommend doing it before some of the other DLCs.Point Lookout is actually one of the few DLCS thats more fun at higher levels than low. The enemies are just so varied compared to the other DLCs and its fun to go through once you have a large amount of stimpaks to burn through.Overall Id recommendAnchorage first by far if you dont care about keeping progression slow You could definitely do at as low as level  maybe lowerEither this and then The Pitt or do The Pitt first. The Pitt is more fun IMO at lower levels as the enemies are much more challenging at lower levels and its weapons make sense right about that level  area. Broken Steel would probably be my choice for third as at about this time youre probably nearly done if not already done with the campaign and its a good extra  hours or so of gameplay. Its against heavily armored Enclave too so youll want to be about level  before starting.Id recommend Zeta next. It doesnt really fit in anywhere but i really wouldnt do it on harder difficulties unless youre very heavily armed with a large amount of stimpaks. Do it at around level .Then Point Lookout. I only recommend it here because its so much fun to play on higher difficulties. Just make sure youve got tons of stims as theres some enemies in it that will decimate you easily.Anyways unlike New Vegas you can really start any of them at any level but I found that order to be most enjoyable to me personally. Regardless of the order you picked you will really want to be sure youre ready before attempting Point Lookout and Zeta as in both health is relatively scarce and the enemies can get to be a bit overwhelming.Apologies for wall of text. Edit After reading Flodders message Id also like to know if this is your first Fallout because if so I can explain what I mean in each of these messages if theres any confusion.,Fallout,cqk6ucs,3,t5_2qnzu

If youre anything like me it can be very easy to go from main quest to main quest without taking any breaks for side quests. I would recommend doing every side quest but if you arent into doing that I would recommend at least doing Oasis and Reillys Rangers. Those are two of my personal favorites. If you havent gotten any of the DLC I would highly recommend getting at least Broken Steel because it extends the main story. For the other four Mothership Zeta is generally viewed as being noncanon on rfalloutlore and is generally lacking in terms of gameplay story and loot it just leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion but thats just me. Operation Anchorage is entirely combatoriented but the loot at the end makes it all worth it. The Pitt has an excellent story would highly recommend playing it. You can treat Point Lookout more as an expansion rather than a bonus story it opens a new extremely challenging area as well as a bunch of new weapons and side quests specifically for it. If you do get them I would recommend waiting to do them until towards the end of the preBrokenSteel main story just because of difficulty level and endgame loot especially in the case of Operation Anchorage.,Fallout,cqrzvg0,10,t5_2qnzu

3828447,0,t3_34a3oi,If the NCR fail at Hoover Dam no locations in NV will fall under NCR rule because they would be pushed from Camp McCarren and forced to go back west the Dam is simply too strategically significant. The NCR lose due to critical lapses in strategic management and security from overextension into the Mojave and micromanagement of field officers as opposed to autonomy as is needed on a rapidly developing battlefield. The Great Khans would still be aligned with the Legion and be culturally assimilated i.e all the sick and elderly get killed women sold as wivesslaves to officers men forced to abandon all Khan culture all children assimilated by Legion teaching. The Powder Gangers would be crushed since they are criminals as would the Fiends. Since Keha is dead no one is around to spare the Followers so they die too as do the Kings Mr. House and all of the Families pretty much all of New Vegas really. The Brotherhood inflicts heavy losses on the Legion but is ultimately destroyed by attrition. The Boomers will eventually also lose by attrition but much more slowly since they have the firepower to keep even the Legion at bay. The Legion eventually collapses under its own weight due to its total lack of cultural foundation and primitive hierarchy which relied entirely on Keha micromanaging through his officers but its too late to save people in any of its territories. The Legion leaves behind a legacy of raiders composed of its most savage and iconoclastic members and slavers composed of the remaining members who retain the powerabusing and few pieces of Legion dogma who will eventually reform into their own nationstates of slavers and raiders. The entire Wasteland is a worse place for it. ,Fallout,cqsobaj,47,t5_2qnzu

4048671,0,t1_crhqmn9,gtYou keep saying several of the settlements are just poppycockgtYoure right that it isnt shown or talked about to my knowledge. But COME ON MAN.I never said either of those though It is part of the food supply I suppose but its nothing remotely close to reliable. Getting past even one wave of the mutants or ghouls or mirelurks or raiders that would be defending the small amount of food in one location would be tough for a lot of the population. Then theres the trip home as well. Eventually theyd run out of places that they could scavenge if they havent been killed by the growing numbers of super mutants around these places or the mirelurk armies within them. A supply is generally something dependable or to be relied upon. A warehouse full of meat slabs to ship to restaurants would be a supply. A tin of mentats and  Nuka Colas at the end of a metro tunnel isnt a supply its equivalent to just finding one slab of meat in a room that will never have another slab again its just finding things. gtOasis presumably doesnt need itOasis is another thing that needs the question what do they eat?. So what do they eat? I didnt see any berries on those bushes. I didnt see any apples on those trees no carrots in the dirt. What do they eat? Do they just eat the grass? The leaves? Do they take occasional nibbles off of Harold? Do they go in the caves and hope that their inexperience with fighting is enough to take out those mirelurks in the caves or at least enough to buy them enough time to take the Nuka or  in the cave? What do they eat? Ill give  one that you swore off though. Republic of Dave makes sense. Theyve got Brahmin pens there at the very least they have some form of food source. Aside from that a lot of it makes little sense I dont think the merchants could possibly have the supplies to feed all those places from the metro tunnels and decaying prewar offices. ,Fallout,crhs2zn,0,t5_2qnzu

4159105,0,t1_cruc8ml,gt They might just want to put a lot more emphasis on a narrated storyBut you can do that without making the story be about who the character the player is.  The great thing about games like fallout was the ability to make moral decisions yourself not just Be good or bad? but decisions to skip entire quest lines by instead killing someone or stealing from them..saving yourself instead of them..etc.  Some games have Press A to let them live  karma and press B to let them die  karma fallout just lets you inherently make the decisions yourself throughout a decent chunk of the game and live with the lost gameplay or the consequences.Fallout  almost never makes you do something you do not feel you would do in the situation.Fallout  truly lets you decide who you are and stuff happens around you with you and to you..the game is not ABOUT you though you decide who you are.,Fallout,cruckaa,8,t5_2qnzu

How many times am I going to listen to the same voiced lines before they get fucking old? Not just in conversation but if the character makes comments during play. Im thinking of Bioshock Infinite.The best thing about Fallout is the endless possibilities the power of the players imagination to construct playthrough after playthrough and each one can be unique.

As someone who played Fallout  and  when they first came out I was  disappointed with how little the Fallout  story referenced the past two games. Yes they included Enclave and power armor and all the things but the story didnt have deeper references. For example the broken down highwayman in New Vegas was a little touch that showed the writers and devs for New Vegas were really into the first two Fallout games. The story in Fallout  was just more superficially related to the prior games. That doesnt mean  was bad or even worse than NV. Its just not as well connected.

If thats the case inengine can just mean it was a cutscene made for a specific workstation that is a lot more powerful than a consumer PC rendering only the things it needs for a specific angle. This happens a lot these days.  Even if you take a demo recording applied video editing music and different camera angles it can give a completely different feel than the actual game. Heres a good example.    Now Im going to go to bed because I was up till  AM ranting about a game that only has a cinematic teaser out.

4176849,0,t3_38mei7,For me definitely the first time I saw New Vegas. It was night time I was finally completing my circuit around thr map and I jumped over a rock and there it was lit up like a christmas tree right behind the monorail. It had amazing gravity the thing Id searched for so long and I got tunnel vision as far as I was concerned the only thing between us was a couple miles of flat ground. I dont think Ill ever forget that. Then I couldnt figure out how to get into the city did half lap around it untill I realized that freeside is the entrance then I got pissed when I found out I didnt have the caps to get in. Thats the game in a nutshell I thinkA close second is the first time I played Fallout  and I got lost trying to get to Galaxy News Radio or somewhere in DC since I still thought a straight line was the best plan I ended upin some location that to this day I havent found again and I was being chased by super mutants abd the only weapon I had was a fat man.

4189544,0,t1_crxq2ej,The Enclave in Fallout  was at only a fraction of its strength after their main base which housed their leaders and chief scientists was blown up at the end of Fallout . The small forward base at Navarro was summarily abandoned so only outlying forces in Chicago DC and possibly a few other areas survived.  Chicago cant be very big or powerful since they couldnt do much more than slap an old license plate over a hole in EDEs side and send him on his way. The base for the Capital Wasteland got all blowed up and its not unreasonable to assume that most of their leadership was in it at the time.  So all thats left is retirees hiding in the Sierra Nevadas and some troops who were lucky enough to be outside the crawler when Lyons Pride stormed the place. They dont have any support structure to speak of and unless theres another secret nest of them at a remote airfield theres no real chance that theyll stage a comeback. ,Fallout,crxt3n2,3,t5_2qnzu

You never know where the next door will take you. You might walk through a building that only takes a couple minutes or walk into the basement and find a crater leading underground and it might take a half hour before you hit the end. Thats also a way to get more money and ammo etc. You should go explore kill things find things get over encumbered. Then drop stuff so you can fast travel back to one of the hub cities. Sell it off and fix your stuff. Buy more stuff and then fast travel back to the closest place to where you were in the wasteland. Rinse and repeat. That became like a meta game amidst the rest of the game and most of what I enjoyed about the game. Finding cool stuff reading about the world and talking to weird people.

In it we burn away irrelevancies until we are left with a pure product the Truth. For all time. Now sooner or later this man or others like him will succeed in replicating Commander Data. And the decision you reach here today will determine how we will regard this creation of our genius. It will reveal the kind of a people we are what he is destined to be. It will reach far beyond this courtroom and this one android. It could significantly redefine the boundaries of personal liberty and freedom expanding them for some savagely curtailing them for others.

4224442,0,t1_cs1qp49,Yeah I agree on it being the internal moral compass thing. But the reason why I dont think it is a good thing at least as it was in fo and nv is because in I think for a karma system to be good it need to be consistence in its implementation so you agree? And in order to be consistence a standard or a ruleset must be developed. And now that moral standard might vary from person to person so for each and every time the game disagree with the player on whats a good and bad things to do it make the game a lesser experience. I think a black and white choice like the megaton one is a good thing but imo you dont need a karma point pop up for the player to feel the weight of that decision if the choice by itself is meaningful enough. Thats my take on it anyway. ,Fallout,cs1rjek,1,t5_2qnzu

Much of the main story stays the same independent of who you side with it was a rather clever way to get  quests for a price of one.Not to mention outside the main story there is very little content in the game. The most towns are laughably contentless and shallowe.g. Boulder city Nipton Primm there are few hidden quests but not much to discover. FNV reminded me more of a sightseeing tour with the convoluted map with cleverly placed hills deathclaws and invisible walls feeding you most of the playable content if you followed the main story without taking shortcuts.

That thing was  years old for fallout  and  years old for New Vegas Its called Fallout New Vegas btw not Fallout  Vegas No shit its going to have problems for games  years older than itself. Your only proof of this stuttering a youtube video in your steam forum post is also not available. Theres tonnes of people in your steam forum also saying that they arent having an issue. You even say yourself But WHY do some get it but most dont? A problem with on your end doesnt constitute a major flaw with the engine.You even admit to desperately trying to find someone else with this same issue. There is a reason im posting it everywhere incase someone has the exact same issue as me and know what causes it. To which someone replies I played through FO with GTS MB and E DualCore I did not have a single issue I played till the end. I used whatever NVIDIA display driver was around at the time.  The exact same GPU and no issues.I really dont know why I picked apart your argument considering how pointless it was. Yes the gamebryo engine an engine originally constructed in  is outdated. Youve proven nothing other than that you seem to be among a small minority of people who suffered a display issue with  year old hardware. If the vast majority of people arent getting this synchronized combat and lack of functionality at  fps Which I know I and all the people Ive asked arent then its a niche issue a flaw that more than likely exists on the users part rather than the creators.,Fallout,cs3oh0d,2,t5_2qnzu

4247483,0,t3_39lr01,It usually takes me around  hours to get one of my Completionist playthroughs where I do just about everything the game has to offer. For which game has more content its quite difficult to say actually. NV has more quests and arguably a longer main story depending on how you go about it Fallout s can be rushed through rather quick especially if you dont have broken steel. Fallout  has the environment advantage though. I love the atmosphere of NV but its world is pretty desolate where as DC is dense as hell. The different worlds is one of the biggest contributors to the debate between the two.Id say go with New Vegas. NV has more total content in the form of set quests and tasks but F has FAR more to explore. Id say their length is quite equal if you take your time and try and get the most out of each but Fallout s world is enormous and is begging to be explored where NV feels like  of the size but within that smaller world there is more to do. You get the dilemma?So Id recommend FNV but F would be just as long really the real question is which do you want to play? If you want to play FNV then dont worry about the time because there isnt a big enough difference to make it worth playing the game you dont want to play as much.,Fallout,cs4ejhq,2,t5_2qnzu

Once you reach max guns you can only level up by hacking computers to increase gun perks? No thank you. If it were to stay as the fallout levelling system you dont have to change your playstyle to advance. ,Fallout,cs5ff2c,3,t5_2qnzu

4261895,0,t1_cs5ys7w,Well firstly this isnt the only subreddit I see you post in I do see you in Dying Light and also in Left  Dead  although that was only the once. your  fallout videos are click bait in that they will draw people in for easy views you arent saying anything new that anybody knows but the titles make it sound like you know something then after clicking its obvious that you dont know very much I apologise if that seems rude and youre just repeating what we already know. If you actually had something interesting to say about coop or the fallout leak then I would say they arent click bait but again just repeating what the world knows isnt interesting.I know you have other videos that arent like that but I dont want to see you go down this slippery slope of posting stuff that might boost your views because you also had something with your dying light videos.Now I will admit I didnt finish your video because as I said you werent saying anything that hasnt been said a million times before but at roughly a minute into the video you say and I quote I dont like it I dont like the elder scrolls online I love just running through the elder scrolls alone and having a fun time.,Fallout,cs618pe,2,t5_2qnzu

Dont get me wrong Dishonored was pretty good but not nearly as amazing as the trailer hyped it up to be. It just wasnt as immersive in the end.Fallout ... well eh. Looks fun but not enough to set it apart for me yet. Im still open to being wooed. Then there was that crappy TF clone. I cant say much really I spaced out for that.Im not expecting much from E.

4278748,0,t1_cs7kvxu,Thats not really an argument against the games becoming more simplified action adventure games though. The original games may of not had durability but they had a lot more RPG elements. Its not as if they removed to it to stay in touch with the original games Im guessing along with the new dialogue they did it to make the game more streamlined and friendly to wider audiences. Hopefully this isnt at the cost of the game being depthy and complex because Skyrim was a imo a good example of a very well polished shallow game. ,Fallout,cs7xmq6,1,t5_2qnzu

4289746,0,t3_3a2d1g,Can we all just agree that the ideal Fallout game wed love to see is one that is written by Obsidian pre Chris Avellone departure but the game world is designed by Bethesda?Fallout New Vegas had stellar writing that comes the absolute closest it can to feeling like the original Fallout games. Fallout  just feels more like a weird fanfic by an awkward chick on DeviantArtfanfiction.net by comparison.However the world in Fallout  is so dense in content with loads of places to explore that feel like they have meaning. New Vegass game world was honestly pretty dull by comparison. It had its moments but it felt like it was just there to be there. And I get that it took place in a desert and deserts are barren wastelands in themselves but there shouldve been a bit more content to spice things up.Combine Bethesdas world building experience with the writing from the original writers of Fallout and you have a recipe for one of the best Fallout games ever made. Something that could actually surpass the legacy of the originals instead trying to emulate them or be inspired by them.And on the subject of the whole dialog wheel bit I feel Obsidian would still do fine with it as well. Despite Alpha Protocol being a buggy mess of a game it has some great writing with a lot of choices that actually have consequence to them. And it used a dialog wheel system. Not only that but some of the dialog was actually timed and they still pulled it off.,Fallout,cs96cg3,3,t5_2qnzu

4297094,0,t1_cs9x810,Personally I disliked it from an RPG standpoint because it really hamstrings the ability to define my character from the outset. The whole point of RPGs is to make a character using the game mechanics story lore and numbers it gives you. Skyrims system did not allow me to do that. Pretty much every character was homogenous from the outset onwards. I could do pretty much anything on everyone and I had to grind a bit to get my character anywhere. Not to mention the perks were more or less kinda useless anyway. People will say that the system was more realistic and gave more freedom  but tbh Im okay with making concessions for gameplay as long as theyre intuitive enough and serve a purpose in the same way Im willing to make concessions for cinematography. Yeah realistically a shooting line shooting civilians would take s but films will usually edit it to  mins. And meaningful restrictions based on what you choose for your character mechanically is basically the point of an RPG.

Relax.Complaining about not having an optional feature you do want is not the same as complaining about having an optional feature you dont want.  If you dont want to optionally samesex marry in a video game its easy to not samesex marry.  If you want to samesex marry in the game but its not offered by the developer its much harder to get what you want.  After all arent video games mostly about giving freedom to the player?  Otherwise it might as well be a movie not a game.gt Literally nothing is being taken from you.Removing samesex marriage as an option by definition takes away the ability to be in a samesex marriage in the game.EDIT Typo.,Fallout,csdnxgp,0,t5_2qnzu

4347401,0,t1_csfo85t,Im glad to hear that Im not the only person who is pretty much neutral in this whole thing. Ive had it with being called racist andor sexist because I agree with the stated goals of some groups while condemning their harassment. Im not going to bring up the names of the groups because itll probably just invite that reaction from those people. That whole fear of the other thing is my worst favorite part of the whole thing. Its like So and so did this awesome thing that helps people but they support this group so Im gonna pretend it never happened. Then the same people get upset when you tell them that they should be more accepting after you look into their troubled past. I also hate to think that people who think that certain sjw havens are actually safe spaces when any sort of diverging opinion is often suppressed. Thats my main issue with these people. They pretend to be supportive but only of the people who agree with them. Any dissent must be destroyed. Id rather just make a place for anyone to talk a free zone. Where any experience could be shared without ridicule. of course for more controversial subjects Id require evidence.  Id mainly allow it to selfmoderate but if something really bad would go on I would probably intervene. That idea is probably wishful thinking though because some group or another would probably try  and take it over.Im also on mobile btw thats why Im hoping i didnt miss anything.,Fallout,csfon60,1,t5_2qnzu

For a T that means the main gun is disabled the coax gun and bow gun are either disabled or removed outright. The turret slew and main ghn elevation barrel most of the breech remain but it is rendered incapable of firing a shell.HOWEVER anyone with a title II license and enough money can own their tank in fully combat ready condition. Main gun ammo is at minimum  USD per shot due to taxes as the cartridge is considered by law an exposive device. Any shell in said cartridge that contains an HE component also has the tax levied on it so firing aphe from a t would cost in tax alone k every time you pull the trigger.,Fallout,csgryo1,1,t5_2qnzu

4386133,0,t1_csjzkk7,Saint Row is very different from Fallout in the way it works. For example in Fallout you can craft things you can find unique weapons on the ground and so on. There are more considerations than just tossing someone in. To elaborate on that point consider how you would implement unique drops ammo VATS and even how far apart both players could be involved. Saves crashes and so on put other problems forward. The idea of just being a companion would be very boring is also part of my point. I dont think Bethesda would do something so unpolished. Again not saying its impossible but its a bit more effort than what goes into something like saints rows coop I imagine.To do it well would require quite a bit of different setups and such if you wanted the other person to do their own stuff on the side too. I mean it could just be something where you can jump in but thats probably not what they would want to add. The time and effort is probably why they decided to axe it because they wouldnt want to give us a subpar product. Lots of people think its super easy to do but I dont think thats the case.,Fallout,csk1y07,-1,t5_2qnzu

The real cost is your timeThis can take  days to print and thats assuming youre on hand to pull each fresh part from the printer and start the next set. For reference printing the front half of the hinged sleeve alone took me   hours. Even with super fine detail settings on the printer youre still going to have to do some sanding and trimming to make sure everything fits right. Then unless you can colormatch your filament theres more sanding prep in order to primepaint.Depending on the materialstools one might need to acquire in order to take on this project it might end up costing more than the  premium of the PipBoy edition.

4448733,0,t1_csrfdp6,Well the main character in Fallout  alone has  lines of dialogue according to Bethesda. Fallout  had a total of  for every character in the game. Also New Vegas was at  lines total for all four of their DLCs combined not including the stand alone game but it was around as much as Fallout So if they use  lines of recorded dialogue just for secondly and plot related characters we can take that number increase it since Fallout  will be larger then add  just for the more character. By the way thats  recorded lines of dialogue conformed so far just for the main character.How do I know?

The US government believed that a better plan of survival for America would be to make it so only high ranking government and military officials along with some very rich people be the only ones to survive. These individuals sought shelter on an offshore oil rig keeping them out of harms way from the nuclear war. They viewed the civilian population as lesser disposable individuals. As such the government partnered with VaultTec had VT build almost all vaults with some kind of experiment in mind. The data from these experiments would be used by the Enclave a postwar organization born from the government on the oil rig. Not all vaults were experiments however. I think  of them were built to safety regulations. The EnclaveGovernment never expected the human population to survive which lead them to becoming who they are today.,Fallout,csromd6,1,t5_2qnzu

4453379,0,t1_csrzn25,Sound like a white person? Pal people get accents based on where they live not from their genetics. A Vietnamese man can grow up in a predominantly black neighborhood surrounded by black friends etc. and develop whatever accent they may have. Any person could have an accent like Franklins from GTA V. It all depends on where you grow up and who grows with you.Think of where the Sole Survivor lives. He was presumably part of the military. Depending on his stay in any country that may have actually changed his accent around. At the start of the game youre in what seems to be a rich neighborhood. You would think that hes been living here for some time. I would say at the very least it was  months he lived there. Thats just going off the babys age which Im thinking is  months. The other  months would serve to kinda push along a house hunting kind of deal and whatever else might pop up. Anyhow Im assuming its a bit of a rich neighborhood since Im pretty sure every house there had cars. Cars operated on nuclear fusion. IIRC this was really expensive until around the start of the Great War. Plus they live next to a Vault. Thats probably going to drive the prices up for a few years not sure how many havent read the lore in a while during its construction and such.White hair options? Really? Its just hair. People can cut it and make it like that whenever they want. Ive seen more than my fair share of Spanish folk with some of the haircuts they previewed.

Your computer sounds like it is getting up there in its years and it may struggle to run modern games.,Fallout,cswmo9i,1,t5_2qnzu

4493348,0,t1_csx0chj,So its a long read since all this comes from the game and is now being mashed into the Fallout Wiki but here you areRead about Technology specifically. It will only focus on the Fallout world technology and wont point out the differences like Divergence will.Read about Divergence this covers the differences of the world we live in compared to Fallouts world. The read will cover technological world political and development changes. Its really all summed up in a TLDR called World of Tomrorrw.America. This is everything there is about America. The biggest thing to take from this really is the quote The preWar federal government of the United States was not too different from that of stcentury America in our own universe albeit significantly less democratic by the midst century. Basically stating The government in Fallout remained the same until conflict in the mid s.That is all that is confirmed through the games. There isnt much on Canada though except the whole annexation thing... Anyway. This stuff mostly points out that world technology developed differently. However it did not change the rate of the which our society developed necessarily. For example hating communism and calling people hippies which has happened in Fallout is a s thing also Nixon was still a president! The timelines are only different in the sense of global politics such ass the USSR not dissolving after the s and also the fact that the US and China never went through a  reestablishment of cordial relations or rapprochement... Basically they never had the opportunity or care to understand each other which leads to China never seeing the freemarket idea.ANYWAY this stuff doesnt go into the social aspect of the Fallout world. However with the information that Fallout gives and how many things do stay the same except for the few details that cause the war and technology you could say the society developed in a similar way too. TLDR Technology was drastically different nuclear tech instead of inventing the microchip allowing computers to be small. Russia never stopped being the USSR. US and China never went through rapprochement understanding each other in the s. All other politics seem to stay the same even Nixon was still president. So you could assume that society developed in a similar way as well.ALL THIS BEING SAID I COULD STILL BE WRONG THIS IS JUST WHAT I UNDERSTAND FROM PLAYING AND READING ABOUT FALLOUT.,Fallout,csx1nr4,1,t5_2qnzu

If the slaves want to just have a place to live a decent life they wont need to produce nearly as much to sustain it.

4559221,0,t3_3dhsdr,Make sure to go to No Mutants Allowed and get the classic weapons mod. It adds a great classic weapons mod that replaces all real life firearms with FO and  guns. It helps if running around with Ms and M SAWs ruins the game immersion for you. Otherwise great game. Just keep in mind its very rough around the game edges. The devteam said that they barely had time to play test it due to crunch time so take that as you will. The events are definitely cannon again people just dont like the game due to little regard for the lore at some points. The game isnt a waste of time and has some great moments. Just keep in mind this is fallout game in name only and that you will be doing a lot Real Time or Turn Based Strategy inside a fallout setting. For best results I would play the game thru once onmodded then came back to it with the classic weapons mod or make your own with the un official editor. I made quite a few mods myself mostly just adding power armor and acid squirt guns to lv as well as all the cut content. FUN FACT This is the only Fallout game with online multiplayer to date. Back in the day the game had servers where you could play online in Deathmatch Team Deathmatch Capture the flag and more. Hell they even let you play as a dog in multi if you wanted to.

4639373,0,t3_3eitqm,Energy weapons is simple you can convert between the  base ammo types as well as upgrade to Overcharged Optimized and Max Charged. These upgraded versions can not be converted back. You can also recycle drained energy weapon ammo at a workbench.With guns ammunition consists of  parts a caliberspecific case a typespecific primer typespecific gunpowder and generic lead.When you dismantle ammo you get these resources in a certain amount for instance  .mm rounds yields  .mm case  units of lead  units of rifle powder and  small rifle primerThe other way around is crafting ammo just like you would any other item at a workbench example  . case  units of lead  units of rifle powder and one large rifle primer yields  . roundYou can only create regular ammo and with Hand Loader one type of special ammo per caliber exception being shotgun shells. These are generally a tradeoff between Hollow Point and Armor Piercing offering the advantages of both to a lesser degree example . SWC has .x Damage and  DT.Ammo typesRegular ammo is your bread and butter until you can reliably craft Hand Loader ammo. Theyre cheap and dont have any obvious advantage.Hand Loader ammo is almost universally a flat upgrade to regular dealing more damage and often having DT reduction to boot.Hollow point ammo deals much more damage to unarmored enemies but the xDT multiplier means armored enemies will quickly have enough resistance to counter the damage bonus.Slugs are solid shotgun shells as opposed to buckshot which consists of several small pellets. They do less damage in total to unarmored enemies but since all damage is packed into one large projectile theyre more effective against armored ones as well as being much more accurate.Armor Piercing ammo deals only  damage but reduces DT of their target by . This means theyre slightly worse against unarmored but against anything moderately armored theyre your best choice..LR is just a caliber theres nothing special about it.GRAammo means it was added with the Gun Runners Arsenal DLC. It doesnt have any real effect on the game.edit also Theres a few more shotgun ammo type of note Flechette rounds replace the pellets with sharp nails doing less damage but punching through armor. I personally find these useless.Pulse Slug What it says on the tin. Basically a pulse grenade except you shoot it with a shotgun. Combined with a Riot Shotgun youll never again have to fear Sentry Bots.Dragons Breath Sets the target on fire. Not that useful but very satisfying to use.,Fallout,ctfczic,5,t5_2qnzu

More bombs going off in the same general area doesnt make the radiation spread further it just makes it more dense. Deadly for sure but that wouldnt cause it to spread into South America much less the far reaches of the Pacific.I know for stories sake the idea is that the entire world was irrevocably changed see your quoted paragraph but realistically speaking its unlikely the effects would be that devastating. It doesnt even mesh up with the story even the underground vaults would have had a hard time surviving that level of devastation especially if you are bringing things like tectonic shift in to play but thats not something Im going to bother getting into!Im not going to hold an argument over whether or not the story is true. Its a fantasy game truth is whatever you want it to be. All Im saying is that it is realistically plausible that some of the more remotenontargeted areas of the world could have survived. Of course the people in the games would have no knowledge of this which imo makes it an even more interesting twist.,Fallout,ctrzjmw,2,t5_2qnzu

After playing through it again recently I really appreciated the atmosphere and the game a lot more. I would say give  a chance Fallout  was the first game of its style in the series and I cant fault them for the first try in the series I think Obsidian showed Bethesda a lot of things that made the series better and Im confident things that made the series better from NV will be seen in . Along with the story Im not sure about that. Thats the one thing Im sort of worried about.,Fallout,cturkkq,2,t5_2qnzu

4762124,0,t3_3g1nna,Call me crazy but I just dont like the idea of no level cap. It decreases the urgency for specialization and allows for sloppiness in the games design overall. With a level cap there is raised a question of what you will do with it. Planning and strategy will be emphasized and characters for the most part will have an inherent personality from their contrasting skill sets. Doing away with this means that previous investment in one direction will not effect ones progression in another. It also allows and encourages one to not remain weak in any aspect. In short the more different players play the less different the outcome.I also see a problem in that this will add a grind to prevent the building ones character lest they become to powerful. A level cap allows for a better paced experience that allows you to build a character exactly how you like it in a shorter amount of time. It encourages experimentation and replaying the game in different ways. Putting a grind in a persons way and making it so their character could become anything anyways just encourages them to train their character in a different dicipline ad opposed to starting a new one.I just dont understand how this aspect which has been fundemental to Fallouts design can be ignored so easily. Isnt anyone else even a little skeptical of this decision? Does everyone here like Skyrim better than Fallout NV and ? It seems like any changes to this game along the lines of making it more like Skyrim gets met with praise around here. I dont think anyone should not be allowed to have the opinion that this is a good change but I am shocked that so many can not see how this changes everything and possibly not for the better.,Fallout,ctut6c8,2,t5_2qnzu

But compare that to say Morrowind if you become a werewolf there it has a tremendous impact on faction standings and general reputation. But in Skyrim? I guess everyone in Skyrim is just used to Werewolves running around.What Im trying to say is I hope Fallout  lets me makes mistakes. I want stuff to be able to go wrong. To be not how I planned.

The intent was initially to create a virus that would sterilize the infected people to be used on enemies such as China.The New Plague arose in  after Chinese Hei Gui agents managed to steal some of the Limit during a sabotage of the Hoover Dam testing labs. The spies were in the process of trying to escape Denver and were killed breaking samples of the virus in a crowded public area. The epidemic killed approximately twohundred thousand citizens in the United States including cities such as Denver Boulder and Colorado Springs. The United States closed its borders and the firstever national quarantine was declared.,Fallout,cty525a,2,t5_2qnzu

I am obviously not buying on launch Skyrim taught me that but at least they seem to be fixing the combatwhich was fucking terrible in Fallout  and merely tolerable in New Vegas. I actually thought Obsidian did a significantly better job with New Vegas than Bethesda did with Fallout . In Fallout  with a little planning you could max out all your skills. In New Vegas you could only max out about half of them. In Fallout  you get a perk every level in New Vegas it is every other. Bethesda seems to have a design philosophy of quickly granting the player a lot of power and reducing the challenge. I dont know if they are doing it to appeal to a large base or if they have some other reason but I despise games like that.

4891456,0,t1_cub1b8f,Then say specifically what the Oblivion route is compared to Skyrim. You bashed Skyrim for being too hyped advertisement powered by memes and true criticism that the quests felt like looking for something someone lost or wants  you to find. You didnt come off as much as fan than you meant too.However the thing about the Skyrim is that the hype actually delivered. Despite the console limitations they went above what people expected you just may have expected more. Causal players had a chance to try the game out without being scared of the skill system of past TES games. I liked the story and the sidequests as much if not more than Oblivions. There is to much good to discredit Skyrim for the odd quests that make you retrieve something from a basic location a fault of the system Bethesda developed where they would always spawn new fetch quests for the players who completed most of the quests to have something to do. But these fetch quests also served another purpose if you never did them you could find yourself underleveled because you always needed targets to practice offensive skills or they wouldnt develop. sorry disregard this point got this comment mixed up with a different user Also the thing about the hype train being powered by memes that was most if not all the communitys doing the game was just after memes popularity skyrocketing into everyones common knowledge even those who didnt use sites like reddit. Im a fan of the Angry Joe show too by you have to remember that Meta critic has to cover as many people as they can and their scores have to reflect on a genre of games not a specific franchises fanbase and even though Oblivion was a good game that doesnt mean no other TES game could not surpass it. This doesnt mean that fans of Skyrim or FO are gamers who dont know good games thats a terrible point of view because it all comes down to personal opinion if a game is good or not. Id like to add many would not consider a  pt game good but just alright Mc scores are more akin to the traditional US grading system where anything below an  would be mediocre Also if I remember right Joe actually rated it quite highlyrated even for some one Ive never seen a perfect score and gives out s very scarcely.again mixed up repliesEdit some fixing up after mixing up,Fallout,cub3v2v,2,t5_2qnzu

For example a larger distance visibility is more atmospheric in a wasteland scenario. And to gain that you have to make some compromises in texture details for example or the lighting. As you stated yourself the lighting is also a good example for the developers intentions. I played fallout  years after its release and my first thought was the graphics are ugly as fuck but after some time I got used to it and started to love the decisions the developers made. ,Fallout,cubrfpz,9,t5_2qnzu

Its no secret Fallout  was made to introduce everything to newcomers as a starting point but there was no fucking way Fallout  could stop and explain ancient history from across the entire country in an indepth way.Where as the Originals had you right where it was happening while it was happening and they were able to stop and explain everything in a nuts and bolts way because it was pertinent to their main story lines.Dont get hyper defensive fallout  was never meant to be a recap of everything. Fallout  was made as an easy entry point to the series to introduce brand new people to a franchise they never heard about before but Bethesda had.There is too much to cover for a single games main quest all it could have been able to do is do a short summary and passing mentions to the main plot points that happened long ago.Which is fine because not everyone wants to know everything about a games world and dont want to sit through  paragraphs to learn absolutely everything about everything.Which is why I said depending on how deep you want to tear into the lore.,Fallout,cuct921,-7,t5_2qnzu

A soft breeze blew and the milky blue sky was speckled with stars. Id just heard of Boones story and developed a deep empathy towards him. When Peggy Lee says What if youre cold... but youre so warm inside.... I thought of his tough exterior. In the song I visualize Boones rifle as his guitar. Hes my Johnny and he plays his guitar alongside me. I want to get close to him but I realize what he endured really ruined his emotions and that he could probably never carry on a relationship like he did with his wifespoiler. Yes I had a deep passion for a character. But what can I say?I was always a fool for my Johnny. For the one they called Johnny Guitar. ,Fallout,cug0qu5,45,t5_2qnzu

Like the Doctor my character is just the main character in the story Im experiencing.Im genderfluid and judging by your post I take it that youre transexual so I cant claim to fully understand how you feel. Im just saying that to me the character does not represent me and therefore does not need to make the same choices that I would have made or have the same gender or race as I do. I see games as tvshows or books. Its a story about someone else and my characters gender doesnt tell you more about me than hisher eyecolour.And ofcourse Good luck with your continued transition!

4961370,0,t1_cuji4sc,You seem to have confused my use of the word many with the word most. This isnt semantics I dont mean that  of NV is Van Buren but rather  of Van Buren made it into NV which in turn gave a lot of additional meat to the game. Many of the concepts in Van Buren made their way into Fallout New Vegas albeit slightly altered. Aside from the main quest of Van Buren many of the concepts were adapted into New Vegas.The Nightkin? That was adapted from Van Buren where it was instead a BoS factionOverthrow of a BoS Bunker due to internal dissent? Once again from Van BurenGroup of ghouls that seek to live by themselves and escape the smoothskin? That was changed from the more militant Reservation to the peaceful Bright Brotherhood. On that note a character called Jillian McKinley was probably the basis for Raul Gifted mechanic made into a slave for a faction that is hostile to their kind. Id also argue that some of the militant parts made it into NV as parts of Black MountainPowder Gangers were almost lifted entirely from Van Buren and this kinda shows. In the beginning the powder gangers are the evil faction with no mention of Caesar but after delivering the platinum chip they practically disappear from the story and the Legion takes over. The concept behind the Twin Mothers was modified into the Sorrows. Hecate a secondary antagonist had many of her ways folded into the Legion in NV.Hoover Dam does not look the same this is true but it still plays a very similar role in both games . The Legion and NCR are fighting over it the NCR won the first battle its a major source of power NCR is suffering from moral and equipment shortage now... Function beats form.Hell at the end of Van Buren your task is to stop an AI from launching nukes to clear away a disease. That AIs name? Ulysses,Fallout,cujx4aq,1,t5_2qnzu

4963854,0,t3_3a7qg7,First of all I apologize for my bad English...The fact is certain mobile games attract bunch of nongamersi.e. the people who doesnt have any gaming consoles nor a steam account. They had never and probably are not going to play the real fallout games they believed that they are new to the real games and they need to learn it  hours to enjoy the full content of the game. These nongamers just want to spend  or  min per day to relax a little in some fastpaced mobile games and unfortunately some of them are addictive to the mobile games and spend tons of time and money into it.There are goods and bads behind this phenomena. The drawback as you mentioned is basically that the gaming companies will appreciate more to the mobile game because of the huge profit and subconsciously pay less attention to the real consolecomputerAAA etc. games you mentioned. However I believe that there are advantages of the blooming mobile gaming industry such as by bringing more players into the gaming world so that the misunderstanding of video games can be mitigated.Yes there is evident that investors appreciated more to mobile games as the market skyrockets. Nevertheless I am still an optimist to the entire gaming industry because of the following reasons  a huge number of mobile games players are not the same group of people who plays and support the real games I read this report somewhere but I couldnt find the reference at the moment  Mobile games bring more new players into the industry so that people can understand more the players like you and me  Mobile games can convert some mobile gamer to try the real games. Just try to image that Fallout Shelter is the first fallout game that many people play with and I am sure some of these players would love to give fallout  a try.

Although a large majority of Gravity Falls fans arent able to play the game because of what Fallout is.  Anyway things are getting super heated over there about this poll and I just assumed things over here would have been just as heated.  But its actually surprisingly calm over here.  As for if theyre actually compareable Im not trying to compare the shows.  The fanwar has started because of a poll about what foods better.  But as I said before that wont mean much over here because things are a lot calmer over here than they are on the Gravity Falls Subreddit.  People are actually freaking out because of the  vote difference.

5011698,0,t1_cuptvr1,I think when they made Oblivion it was still too ambitious for them to try a fully voiced game. They really limited themselves and I wish they would have stuck with textbased dialog for at least one more generation. It completely broke down many times in Oblivion. It wasnt too bad in Fallout  but had its moments though I cant recall any specifically right now. For the most part it was smoothed out in Skyrim but I do remember a couple of parts where the voice acting is deimmersing one in particular is how there are two voice actors who have apparently never heard the language construct of putting  really. after a statement to imply casualness. It really bugs me that when they recorded those lines no one was like You didnt say that right it should be like this ltsay it correctlygt and have them rerecord it.Edit To expand on that example in Riften theres Grelka and right next to her stand an Argonian selling jewelry and such. They both say the same canned merchant line Everything I have on display really. The Argonian says it properly. Another way of saying Pretty much everything Ive got on display. The really flows out casually as if it would accompany a shrug. But Grelka says it like Everything Ive got on display. Really! like she thinks you dont believe that everything she has on display is for sale and shes trying to convince you. Theres another merchant a male somewhere that says it like she does. And Im like These people got hired and paid to be voice actors and they dont even understand common English? Furthermore there were how many people in the booth recording them then how many people in playtesting and quality assurance that listened to those lines and nobody caught that?

5021711,0,t1_cuqz0a1,Yeah but Bethesda creates an open world that has an extremely unique mixture of open world player choice and story.A lot of other games try but none really seem to get it right.Combine that with the modding support the story could be terrible the voice acting can be mediocre and itll still be one of the best games of this year and next year and probably last year. Skyrim with all of its problems still got a good  hours on people who after finishing are more than eager to talk about the bad parts. But they still enjoyed the good parts. Shrug  Todd Howard has said in a few interviews that they sacrifice a lot to give the players as much choice as they do. They clearly dont want to expand their head count at Bethesda Softworks Might ruin the quality or style of management they have? Team sizes? idk.

Several days after entering a fake news broadcast will play on the screen in the common area a VaultTec personnel appears only to inform them that they are the only group to have made it into their vaults on time and that it is unsafe to leave for the time being. The broadcast is cut abruptly by what seems to be an explosion and they are never broadcasted to again.Now equipped with the necessary tools and a newfound drive to do the best they can as Americas last hope they dive into  their lives and work as vault citizens. The experiment is designed to see which way the citizens will drive their society when given the choice to do so on their own. Will the  sectors work together to ensure the survival of the vault or will the sectors diverge and and become more controlling of their resources and assets using them as chips in a bid for power to ensure individual survival or something entirely different. The purpose is to see whether or not communism would arise from a group of Americans or would they somehow instinctually stay true to their nation. Will sectors merge or align? Will single sectors divide? Will the common area become nomans land or will it become a great community or perhaps a market will spring up with along with a currency. VaultTec can see which if any is the perfect society.The vault does not have an overseer as to eliminate any chance of a preappointed authority influencing anything. Little do these citizens know there is another vault vault  another perfect number just beyond the doors of their own working under the same conditions all scheduled to open at the same time to truly their societies to test.,Fallout,curkiwz,7,t5_2qnzu

5061263,0,t1_cuw1qew,Thats somewhat fair but two of those the weapon mods and the settlement stuff can be seen as both very basic elements in the game which probably didnt require a lot of thought and work to be put into them but they also might not serve the game in any meaningful way. Settlements might just be a bunch of basic management stuff with a horde mode like putting a bunch of random raiders that have no reason to be there to attack your settlement thats uncompelling to keep playing it for long. It would just get tiring real fast. Sure you could build a bunch of random stupid shit like in the trailer but why waste time and resources on such a thing? Youre diminishing the actual game fallout fans want.Same with weapon mods. Will they actually be interesting? Was it worth putting a lot of detail and effort into that system? Or will it be the same as basically FNV?Dont get me wrong these things could all turn out decent but this is exactly what I meant by caring about the feedback etc.Also I dont really know why such a stupid idea like making the power armor work more like vehicles came to existence.Edit Ah whatever the issue I have with the power armor is something different. Dont mind that comment too much.Edit CLARIFICATION. What I really mean here is that I think putting stuff that their audience likes just doesnt cut it because I feel BGS could really screw up the things because they just dont care how it affects the rest of the game. edit Doing What the audienceplayerbase likes just doesnt cut it. They need to understand. Care. Hardcore mode has so many implications on how it affects the game how it changes the game etc etc. Hardcore almost in a sense NEEDS to exist the way it needed to exist in NV.

5087070,0,t1_cuyxyxh,Vault  wasnt a control vault. Its purpose is never explicitly stated in game but the water chip problem was just a bureaucratic mixup with shipping the spare chips were sent to another vault and not an actual experiment. Chris Avellone has stated that it was intended to remain closed indefinitely. In Fallout  Enclave President Richardson calls Vault  a control group but he also says that it was meant to remain closed until its inhabitants were needed. In context it sounds like hes referring to control in the sense of the Enclaves purify the wasteland mission within the vault Vault  residents wouldnt have been exposed to the pervasive radiation and FEV contamination facing regular wasteland dwellers and not in terms of Project Safehouses control vaults.The thing about control vaults is that there probably arent that many of them. Weve only seen two in the whole series  and  and for all we know they may be the only ones. Even if there are more out there Id be surprised if the total number is beyond small single digits. And Vault  certainly isnt it a control vault wouldnt have stayed closed for  years. DC was worse off than most of the rest of the country but the stated purpose of Project Safehouse which is what a control vault would have followed was to be a temporary shelter. The residents of Vault  could have been released en mass generations earlier than they were and the were born in the vault we die in the vault mantra of Vault  certainly doesnt suggest that Vault Tec had any intention of that happening.EDIT I just looked it up. There are supposedly  control vaults in total. Other than Vault  and  the only other one that has been explicitly named is Vault  in the Mothership Zeta DLC but its never been actually depicted.,Fallout,cuz6nqv,7,t5_2qnzu

5094144,0,t3_3ks9tc,Fallout  GOTY first. Even though most people here seem to prefer New Vegas almost everyone will tell you to play  first with some telling you to play from Falllout  onward. If you like isometric turn based RPGs by all means start with  and play chronologically thats the best way to go. But for an easy way to get into the series without feeling like you are downgrading when playing other games play  first. New Vegas improves on  in too many ways for you to not notice the improvements and the improvements are in areas like story writing and gameplay so its quite noticeable. That being said that does not in any way mean that  is a bad game its to be expected that a game that came out later improves on its predecessor at least in gameplay and the story and writing are improved as well but  didnt try to impress you with a good story they went for an exploration based game. Then move on to my personal favourite if you couldnt already tell Fallout New Vegas ultimate edition. Always get the full dlc editions of any fallout game  needs one dlc to fix itself and a huge part of the story of New Vegas is told through the interconnected DLC with Dead Money being my favourite DLC of all time.

I mean seriously there are so many other good games old and new to occupy your time with such as... I dont know the older and recent Fallout RPG titles...? If youre that excited for Fallout then play Fallout instead of making useless circlejerky posts like this.And plus did people forget Bethesdas track record of buggy games in regards to their open world RPG games? Its very likely that Fallout  will release buggy and thus ruin your day  experience.If I was sensible I would wait at least a couple of days to hear about the state of the game before purchasing it.Me personally Im probably going to wait  months after the game comes out which gives plenty of time for the game to be analyzed I am worried about the quality of the writing and RPG mechanics patched and mods to come out as well as a price dropsale.Ive never preordered and hardly ever bought a game close to day   and there are plenty of new games that are on my list of to get that I am really excited to play but I have not picked up yet such as the Witcher  Batman AK what a great PC launch ey? and Mad Max. But I probably wont pick them up and play them for a while mostly because I have tonnes of other games to play first and I always wait for steam sales and the like before getting them.And this is coming from a  year old without a full time job...

5136827,0,t1_cv4rgaz,My main point was there would be a lot less choice to make in the game due to how expensive VAs are and it would take a lot more work. Not to say that it cant be done The Witcher games for example still manage to have a lot of options and outcomes in quests the Witcher  especially but actually I think it also comes down to Bethesdas already subpar writing in regards to having choices Im afraid that VAs will further dilute an already existing problem Bethesda has. Im not talking about feeling like you are being the character as you mentioned with femshep and the personal RP aspect of that thats subjective. Im talking about dialogue checks more branching narratives with different options etc that kind of stuff like how FNV did stuff. And I think there wont be any low intelligence things because not only did Fo have next to nothing regarding it it would be jarring for your character to be speaking normal until one point you have the option to start talking to a slot machine or when asked a question regarding who you are you could answer with pizza... Etc etc. In FoNV it was Jarring because your character spoke normally up until you go to certain NPCs or events and in Fo it would be the same case but amplified. Sure there will probably be the rude evil guy but I hope they dont do it like Fo which was terrible in that regard being completely black and white. Blow up megaton.... Or not. I didnt like the way Mass Effect did things with the whole paragonrenegade thing where throughout the game if you wanted to play the good character you would always pick the same top right option and if you wanted to play as an asshole youd always pick the bottom right option so especially duding pivotal plot moments it just felt like you were just pressing the unpause button considering one character is always going to be played as one or the other that was the extent of MEs role play and the choices were always structured as good or bad such as killing or saving the Rachni queen in ME where I had initially chosen to cull them as they were vulnerable to indoctrination but it resulted in Shepard going completely out of my usual goody good shoes character to a murderous psychopath. Too bad it didnt matter what you did with the queen by ME.Anyway I am really curious with how Bethesda will handle this and the only way to find out is to play it and see what people say about the RP side of things. Thats my biggest concern about Fo and Im afraid it wont reach FNVs level of writing.Until then Im keeping suspicious.,Fallout,cv56gso,1,t5_2qnzu

You have a choice on how you treat Amata. Whether or not you choose to kill the overseer. Whether or not you collect the bobblehead. Whether or not you killed Butch andor saved his mother. The things that I have noted come back later on in the game when you revisit the vault and how the characters inside will perceive you even in fact which characters you can have and the state of the vault when you enter . When you start a new game by loading a save at the end of the vault you force your character to have the same back story as the first time you have done it.

Either way a lack of social skills and voice projection doesnt make someone less intimidating if he has a gun to your headhow well they handle the gun which would be perception and agility in this game would probably be the bigger factor and people can still project their voice without charismaI mean its not that hard to yell shit out really loud.  A socially inept sociopath is still just as intimidating as a personable one. Can you have charismatic people be intimidating? yes but their intimidation factor does not come from their charisma. Dwayne Johnson is someone with a lot of charisma that can be intimidating but he is at his most intimidating when he specifically acting in a noncharismatic way and his intimidation factor really comes from his sizestrengthnot how well he can project his voice or make friends. In that regard an intimidation perk would make more sense in a strength tree or just as a separate mechanic entirelylevel karma etc. Movie devils and drill sergeants are as effective as they are because they lack charisma they actually rely on their lack of charisma in order to further intimidate and induce a lack of trust and threatand by extension fear.

5212650,1,t1_cvdsixe,wrong or rather a HUGE oversimplification. Fallout  all paint the story that radiation is merely an activator to dormant FEV in peoples systems.We have  factions all saying the same thing FEV is airborne.In fallout  the Masters scientists and the Overseers scientists all agree. FEV is airborne after West Tek got hit and infects every wastelander. This spritzing is the reason the wasteland is full of mutants. Partial infection of FEV opened the door to mutations that would naturally be impossible fallout  being in  so about  years without its negative effects. In fact this fact was alluded to in the Strategy guide as the source of mutation. Strategy guides in this era being written by the dev team themselves with extra lore.Deathclaws were refined read not made refined. by the master fallout  strategy guide and they never lost the ability to breed. The only tie to sterility is being dunked in the vats. A light infection doesnt necessarily make you sterile.In fallout  the Enclave confirmed this by saying FEV was a threat  to pure humanity and needed a counter virus to be spread world wide. Radiation alone is not the sole cause its merely an activator. Saying Radiation is the only factor is like saying the magic of Tamriel has no explanation and not that it comes from Etherius.There is an internal logic to fallout on why the pre war never had to deal with these mutants but the post war did. It was because FEV acted as an amplifier to mutations.,Fallout,cvebfq9,3,t5_2qnzu

If the SS had developed a taste for violence in the military but couldnt find an outlet for it in modern society the wasteland will provide a perfect setting to act on those murderous or destructive tendencies.PTSD could also be an affect on the SS if he or she either has an innate uneasiness attached to warfare or violence and either reacts violently or shuts down.Also any old war wounds acting up?

5331267,0,t1_cvt3wby,The big issue you have with the that processor is that you are running  cores.  Both the minimum and the recommended CPUs listed by bethesda are quad cores. Numbers of cores in intel CPUs matter big time. Your GPU may meet the requiremetns but no matter how good it is it cannot take over or share the processing duties and calculations your CPU should be preforming.  Its quite common in gaming rigs and its called CPU bottleneck.Im not saying that you will not be able to run it. I am saying that you will not be able to run it to a level that most people would see as satisfactory.  If you are looking to upgrade take a look at www.pcpartpicker.com This is a site that was literally born from a subreddit. Pick all of the other system components and it will tell you all the CPUs that are compatible with your build and prices them from several different websites.  You may need to upgrade your motherboard as well as your cpu to reach your desired levels.  It all depends on what kind of motherboard you have now and its capacities.,Fallout,cvt4nvw,2,t5_2qnzu

5341474,0,t3_3o4q1g,Personally I have a lot of problems with the way that Fallout has handled dialog previously because unless its prefaced with a skillperk check I cant get any emotion out of it at all and often end up shocked with the NPC response. Having a way of knowing what the intended emotion behind a line will help make choices and having a voice to that has two ways of helping.  I actually can grasp the emotion in the scene and can react accordingly.  allows people who also have this issue to engage with the game more.But hey.

5500829,0,t1_cvu7oi2,Came across this and thought youd might appreciate itDont forget to cross check the actual article link and the comments to get a rounder view!In short if youre planning to spend a lot or around a hundred Nvidia will have a considerable advantage over AMD. If you plan on spending a moderate amount in regards of lowest and highest price points of GPU ofc  for cheapest is still a ton of cash to me! AMD will have a considerable advantage over Nvidia.The important thing to know though is if it can fit inside your computerr  is huge! and if you can find better deals around you. For instance the GTX  is relatively nearly the same in performance as the r  but the r is still stronger and has DirectX advantages as well as double the video ram. Its also generally cheaper but depending on where you live it might actually be a lot more expensive compared to the  out of US specialty stores etc. making it more prudent to buy the Nvidia to save money for similar performance despite it usually being the more expensive brand. Theres also other reasons such as living in a place where energy rates are abnormally high where Nvidia using a little less can help stave off the costs in the long run living in Hawaii for example.Hope this all helps!,Fallout,cwes6ni,1,t5_2qnzu

Its a private dump sure but I have to be confident that theyre going to do the right thing on this. They Republic Services would be ruined if they caused a radiation disaster. I bet itll just continue like most underground landfill fires and just creep along slowly before running out. And I trust theyve got a solid plan to step in if it gets too close to the radioactive waste site.The public seems to be doing its usual dance when it comes to nuclear issues which is to freak out and not trust anyone. Which is annoying as hell since its rather easy to take a few minutes and learn about the issue but I agree its better to be hypervigilant when it comes to this stuff.That being said spent fuel pools from reactors are really really scary since they must be covered in water in order to not spontaneously combust and spread fallout for miles.

5545226,0,t1_cwkf66n,it makes me sad that most people on here cannot have a conversation about paid modding without getting torches and pitchforks and screaming Burn the Heretics!!! at the top of their lungs.I am not advocating paid modding. I am saying that if there was a system that handled it well with quality control it could be a good thing for the modding community both to consumers and creators. The largest issue with how it was attempted to be implemented via skyrim was a complete lack of quality control.Would paid modding ever work in a elder scrolls style game? i have no idea nor do i see a way to make it work well barring Bethesda having an approval process. Not am i sure that is even what would be best for the community as a whole. BUT i can agree that those are conversations worth having. Instead people all over this thread are shutting it down with childish name calling and personal attacks which only prevent any kind of meaningful conversations and discussion. That really makes me sad. It makes it look like the general population only wants to stick its head in the sand and scream It Haz tu bee Free cause it wuz be!!!!Now consider if the system was done correctly. With quality and content control. How many great mods could dedicated modders be able to produce? How many more Falskaars would we get? How many more like the New Vegas Bounties SeriesIm not saying we should be forced or even allow things like heres a hat i copied from TF  dollars please but with a proper system of quality and content control how many modders would be able to take their labor of love and turn their hobby into something they can justify spending more time on because in addition to being a labor of love it can earn them a little for their hardwork also?These are the topics that should be discussed not Well ... myself and people i know think this is bad so please leave and take it with you That is just small minded bigotry.,Fallout,cwkfpyq,2,t5_2qnzu

It would glitch and freeze I would lose saves and have to backtrack an hour. I couldnt even finish all of the DLC because I had played so long through the main game and some of the other DLC getting platinum that I couldnt finish  of the DLC. Not to mention the initial debacle with the end game and replayability.Did this piss me off and bring me to hate the series?

5572502,0,t3_3rg6cb,The subtle nod is usually typical.  Dont get me wrong if youre a Lore hound there will almost certainly be much for you to devour.  At the same time Bethesda is quite good at balancing this so if theres a characterdecisionevent from Fallout  you MUST know about in order to appreciate it in  it will certainly be explained in some manner.  Of course if you know the background youll probably enjoy those subtle nods more but I dont think Bethesda has ever done something where in a new game only old players could have any idea of what was going on.Good example  JiubSt. Jiub from MorrowindOblivionSkyrim.  If you played Morrowind Jiubs achievements which are chronicled in Skyrim are truly worthy of canonisation.  If you didnt play Morrowind you get an idea in Skyrim that he basically was made a saint for saving Vvardenfell from pests.  You still get the story but having played previous iterations makes it more deeply meaningful.All that being said if I cant grow a mushroom fort with a magicsteam robot and glowing jump elevators Im becoming a tree.,Fallout,cwntjof,6,t5_2qnzu

5575680,0,t1_cwo7mq0,found itgtGary Horsfield Since players spend the vast majority of their time shooting the common infected we wanted to improve the feedback and visceral nature of this experience. In Left  Dead  we provided only the ability to shoot off limbs with blood decals for bullet hits appearing only on the PC. Now in Left  Dead  there are  unique ways to damage an infectedfrom gunfire through melee weapons all the way up to explosive damage. Because many of these wounds are nonfatal players are able to wound an infected more than once resulting in about  possible damage combinations. To create the appearance of a wound we project a texture modified by an ellipsoid that culls the pixels of the wounded area from the infected creating a cavity for the wound to fit into. To avoid memory overhead instead of creating wound variants for each of the infected the wounds are spawned as separate objects that work for the entire horde. Our scripting system allows us to spawn specific wounds from specific weapon hits. For example the sniper rifle headshot explodes the head and the axe creates a slash across meaty areas of the body.i guess it kinda sounds like the same system?,Fallout,cwo7qsv,51,t5_2qnzu

5576950,1,t1_cwocxad,The vocal minority I can probably guarantee are all Witcher fanboysgirls. I dont mind if people criticize the game its their opinion but to judge a game solely on a few screensfew minutes of gameplay from a shady leaker who probably made the game look considerably worse that what it does already is fucking ridiculous. The Witcher  is a really good game but its obvious that its fan base are worried that it will be toppled by Fallout  since this game has a better pedigree will do better commercially and was more anticipated. So the obvious thing to do is completely trash the game to create a negative stigma around it and hope that somehow makes the Witcher  better. Its literally the most ridiculous thing ever. Play both games and decide which is better before blindly saying one is awful. Fallout has become so big and so much of a threat to gaming as a whole that its now the cool thing to hate like every popular thing ever. ,Fallout,cwodfe4,-2,t5_2qnzu

I loved getting irradiated in FO and gaining the ability to heal broken limbs from that early quest. So regaining health through radiation gives me a hard on. I dont know if I am going to go with this or if I am just going to later on increase my endurance in the earlier build but. Damn Ghoulish.So I got rid of armorer sadly and did the same thing with my perception and charisma. Intelligence amp Agility went down but I still have high enough to make me happy.I am still trying to find my perfect build and if you guys have any builds like mine and want to help me out it would be greatly appreciated. Edit Oh and another build which is basically build  with insane luck  EDIT  and if I want to go full gunslinger crafter I will plan on getting Strength Perception Charisma amp Agility up through bobble heads and leveling. ,Fallout,cwq38qr,1,t5_2qnzu

Due to GAME waiting longer than expected to take the scheduled payment PayPal cancelled which then meant GAME couldnt process the order.With regards to banks you should be able to verify details with them over them phone.Bare in mind these editions are preordered so even if they cancelled yours that should mean that it is available for you to order again right there on the phone. No one else can order it online as it should be classed as sold out.The only ballache youll find here is that the order date will change meaning you probably wont get the game on release day.

5611832,0,t3_3rx7ej,I understand your first two points even if I dont agree with them. Good of the whole vs. good of the individual is always going to be subjective based on the outcome we think will happen.However as far as Ashers child is concerned I feel the argument falls flat. What it essentially boils down too is whether to save one life or hundreds. If Ashers justification for enslaving people is that it will eventually lead to a better community the the just thing to do is to sacrifice his child for the betterment of his society. The only difference between Ashers child and any of the slaves is that she was born to the right family. Its not a matter of the slaves being patient its a matter of sticking to your rhetoric.Im not saying it is it is not understandable why Asher wishes to protect his child but by holding her to a different standard than the rest of the community he is acting for selfish reasons. Placing her life on a different level than the hundreds of individuals who will die is unjust.,Fallout,cwsp9vm,2,t5_2qnzu

5621423,0,t3_3s3qy3,Well OP I am all but desperate to be able to get a copy of the game without having to wait  weeks for a payday when rent isnt due so lets give it a shot.  With that in mind people like you are pretty awesome.  On to the actually true story.Back in the Summer of  I was working in a Summer Camp out in the middle of nowhere.  Now as anyone who has had to deal with any collection of  year olds for multiple weeks at a time realize exactly what kind of horn dogs those kids can really be.  There is essentially no stopping to having to keep an eye on them especially since a lot of them liked to try and slip off together at night.  Now you are probably wondering when I am gonna get to the spooky part well I swear it is coming.  One night around halfway through the summer we get the heads up that one of the boys was missing and we started the usual hunt of the places those kids think only they know about.  After a few hours of searching still nothing and we are widening the hunt. Finally come the crack of dawn we find him curled up under the stairs of an old cottage a  fair ways up the lakeshore.  As we are bringing him back he is telling us about the girl that he went there with and how she was his absolute dream girl how he was sad that she ditched him and all that.  Once we get him back and everything is settling back I started talking to one of the older  staff who had been around each summer for years and years.  Before I can even tell him any of the details he describes the girl in detail and basically recounts the kids story though paraphrased.  I was dumbstruck until he explained to me that it happened around this time every year.  Always one of the boys from the same cabin and always the girl is described the same.Now I am not saying that I believe him never been one to attribute things to the paranormal but the fact is he knew everything and I knew for a fact he didnt talk to the boy.  There ya go OP not the spookiest but it has always spooked me out more than I care to admit considering I still dont know what to think.  Now back to writing an essay on the ever so lively world of the history of archival systems...  Best of luck all!,Fallout,cwtw3iy,1,t5_2qnzu

Essentially you could power you whole house by running cable from one generator to multiple conduits on the ceiling and walls or by setting up pylons all around your house. You can even control your power to where whatever you have connected directly to your generator will stay on but all your lights can be switched off by running cable from the generator to a switch and from the switch to conduits and pylons.,Fallout,cwxoa3p,4,t5_2qnzu

5653258,0,t3_3sj0zy,Im enjoying this game more than I could have hoped and no user scores are going to stop that. However its hard not to be somewhat annoyed by it as well.Most of the reviews fall on trivial things and seem a bit harsh for  ratings. But its most likely that a majority of those are by people that already expected to continually bash the game. It says something about someone when they rather be right than just enjoy something in life. Fallout isnt for everyone but those arent even proper critical reviews and are most likely of the same nature as destiny haters. To them its more fun to bash a game they probably know nothing about than it is to actually create a solid foundation for their argument.Oh well.......back to the wasteland for me!,Fallout,cwxubky,-1,t5_2qnzu

5653586,0,t1_cwxs6c9,Well you are new to the series at some point. No one is born having known how a series runs. And W was designed so people could start playing it without having played the previous games. So its totally fair for them to not have played the previous games and not known combat was like that.

5662099,0,t1_cwyvqyv,gt even considering that its still kind of asinine in size and efficiency. why arent domestic fridges as large? its not like cocacola machines in the s were as obnoxious.Style. The machine embodies the aesthetic. The ineffieciency is emphasized to make it feel more inline with the design theme. Its purely as simple as that. The fridges are still big and they dont have that much realestate on the inside. But seriously do a googe image search for retro soda machines and you will see very similar designs the only difference is that the Nukacola machine is exaggerated in its design.gt but that still doesnt explain shit about the machine. like why is there even a door that holds like six bottles that youre able to open without feeding it money? it doesnt dispense a single bottle at a time rather it lets the user take as much as they want.Again look at the older machines in real life. Not needing to insert money is simply a game consideration so we dont need to carry around another currency.gt and the part that moves is small so theres less to model and animate.Animating a big door is no different than animating a little door. And you dont need to limit the available space to limit the amount of loot that is given as is already demonstrated my the larger fridges that rare hold more than a few things if any at all. It simply comes down to design. It looks like a soda machine from our history with certain aspects exaggerated to more closesly line up with the retrofuturisticsscifi aesthetic of the fallout universe. ,Fallout,cwyxs6t,12,t5_2qnzu

I did not get ammo when picking up . mm or shell weapons through the menus. I also did not get ammo sometimes when picking up the gun separately. It wasnt just a graphical bug either.

This is not my character it is some man Bethesda made for me. Do I want to be a father? Nope. Have a wife? Nope. Be born before the war? Nope. Care about my fake kid at all? Nope. Care about my fake dead wife? Nope. All roleplaying options are now dead and please dont tell me they arent. In New Vegas I was a courier. The only thing planted on me was that I carried a nuclear device through a wonderful little town once and erased it all from existence unknowingly. My character through dialogue options had no idea what was in the bag. Or my character through dialogue could not give a fuck that he did something so monstrous. Or he can through dialogue options be regretful of the situation and insist he had no choice. I can be sonless in New Vegas I can be single I can be from wherever I choose I can read my own voice as my own voice I can be Asian or Black or Middle Eastern or Latino without sounding like a middle aged white guy with a family.  Dialogue prompts are too simple to not know what youre going to say. Every option in conversation leads to the same thing. Sometimes youre a smarmy prick while saying yes sometimes youre cordial. But the dialogue options in this game can be melted down to YES I WILL DO YOUR QUEST. THANK YOU. In summation Bethesda totally botched the dialogue system. It was a massive waste of resources.

Metacritic is still one of the best options out there. Reddit is obviously useless as people just want their upboats.But I simply dont agree with that its unrealistic to give a game .

5688785,0,t3_3t1hpe,I think playing on Survival mode is... about appropriate for me.

I always thought Fallout  and NV were way too easy too. But I never liked the realistic survival mode because it just didnt add anything for me. But now with Fallout  I am definitely wishing there was such a mode!Edit I didnt mind that the combat was easy in previous games because I was never into the combat. It definitely was not the draw of either game. However I feel like they really did improve it this time around and with all of the mods there is a lot of incentive to actually care about combat.

Its just another tower with elevators another basement shack another store. Some of them have stashes of mats in the basement some have magazines.It got pretty stale. Im tired of clearing out generic buildings. It felt like New Vegas at least made some more attempt to explain why you were clearing the location and put relevant enemies in there.

I think if they added a final mission where we got a glimpse of next steps now that the opposition is gone it would have rounded out the story a little better. In general the main quests in beth games tend to just end as quickly as possible after the final battle but I think we need a last cool down mission at the end of the story. It would help us get some closure. ,Fallout,cx4otcl,8,t5_2qnzu

This way the people of the commonwealth will have to come together to survive which they will. The institute would let everyone on the surface die they dont care about them and they sure as hell would not be sharing any of that precious energy with them. They would rather be beaming deadly robots across the commonwealth than supplying energy to communities that are in desperate in need. I have no regrets as Hancock would say Of the people for the people. ,Fallout,cx7hfrz,2,t5_2qnzu

Both sanctuary and red rocket station have a chem station there you can craft radaway if you have the items for it.Health take meat off anything and everything at vault  there is a road that goes upwards away from sanctuary follow it and move left near a fallen tree and youll find molerats. there are also some in a cave near the red rocket station cook their meat and get an AP boost as well as  HP back.Level Issue Like you and many others I had an issue with being underlevels in many areas what I have to say is this Idiot Savant is OP and making a wall for sanctuary is amazing. Idiot savant rank  requires luck  and will give at random x experience on any action you preform in addition making things in settlements gives experience. sanctuary is very large so making a wall around the area gives it protection and it also gives you about  levels worth of experience i went from level  to  with idiot savant and some safe cracking going on.Armor armor could be an issue try to wear items such as the assault gas mask most radiers on concord had them as well as the other gas masks these give a whopping  rad resistance alone. the vault suit will give another good chunk of rad resistance and this allows you to add parts arms legs chest to you which gives further resistances. remember metal guards vs ballistics and leather guards against shock damage forgot what gives radiation resistance but if everything fails you still have that suit of power armor to protect ya just dont run with it.,Fallout,cx81mtf,2,t5_2qnzu

Doesnt get the  because of of the terrible changes they did with the chat system and settlers chat system which is like nonexistant a real shame. Oh and the like I literally dozens of times quicksaved and walked up the raiders or other humanoids and they all just shoot at me...not fun at all. Where was the roleplayingBut everything youve said is just so on point. Its a roleplaying game and in the end I who also sided with the institute had to wipe out all these people it just felt like such a let down.A quest to just disable the railroad wipe out everything they had in the base but not kill everyone would have been sweet and a way to just blow up the prydwen and liberty prime would have been way way cooler. Like a stealth ending where you just cripple them without having to murder everyone.Ive tried to go back to previous saves to do the other ones but ive just watched it all on youtube much more satisfying which honestly is quite sad.Game only deserves a   music was fantastic visuals were immersive a ton of content to explore outside the main story but that main story....the game just fell apart once you got to the institute....I wish id played for anohter  hours before i ever went to the glowing sea . But now having a corrupt save and god knows where it happened I probably wont pick it up again till they do a ton of DLC,Fallout,cxa3983,1,t5_2qnzu

5753123,0,t3_3tvnr6,Id like to see a complete overhaul of the settlement. Its such a good idea that suffers from a lot of clunkiness. There should be a bulletin board a radio relay station and a management terminal added to settlements. A bulletin board is the most basic and available to everyone as soon as they gain access to their settlement and would be just what you described a central management hub. Local Leader perk would then grant access first to the radio relay station which would allow you to access the bulletin board menu from your PipBoy while on the go and the second tier would open a managers terminal which would automate the basic functions of that settlement. Id also like to see things like a Security Locker that I could dump extra gear into and my security guards would equip themselves with any of the hundreds of unscrapable legendary weapons and armor pieces I have sitting in my workbench so that I dont have to worry about carry weight and tracking all of them down to manually equip them for the apocalypse. ,Fallout,cxa8aff,4,t5_2qnzu

5753471,0,t1_cxa4qeh,A few added tidbits The Provisioner still counts towards the foodwater and bed requirements of the settlement he was in before he was assigned to the supply line.  They also count towards the size cap. Provisioners physically wander between your two settlements but theyre also essential so they shouldnt die.  The link is in effect as long as theyre on the job so you really dont have to protect them but I like to give them some decent gear for RP reasons.  Theoretically they should help clean up any enemies found between your two settlements. Supply lines only link the inventory of your settlements for breakdowncrafting purposes you cant physically withdraw it.  So if you have some duct tape and steel stored in Starlight you can use it to mod weapons and build stuff in Sanctuary.  But you cant withdraw any of the weapons or armor or other items you have stored in your Starlight workshop inventory unless youre actually at Starlight. Something I dont see mentioned often  supply lines allow your settlements to share WaterFood resources.  The indicator for this isnt very informative you will just know your settlers needs are fulfilled because the resources arent red.,Fallout,cxa9u85,2,t5_2qnzu

Some of the settlements that I recruited but I dont use get attacked all the time and even my main defended settlements get attacked albeit at a much lower rate than the undefended settlements. Im guessing they do that because a raider group is going to go for easy pickings where theres low risk for the reward.

Sorry youve had such a shitty experience! It sounds like you two need to talk about balance. My boyfriend is trying to get me into it with him and only plays for a bit later on in the day after we have done other things. Hes only home for a week per turnaround so time is precious. We take advantage of any good weather for outside adventures especially since days are getting shorter and he has plenty of social catching up to do so Fallout isnt the center of the universe.     But Ive generally found that getting involved with whatever it is hes into has had really positive effects he makes an effort to share gameplay and puts a lot of effort into helping me get ahead I suck at gaming I am not a gamer I didnt even own a TV before he came along. It also gives him a reason to stop and have a different perspective. Sometimes gaming is a chance for me to have him busy with his own thing so I can do my thing uninterrupted. If I really want to distract him sexy times seems to do the trick.     I hope you two can work it out because hes treating you extremely disrespectfully. ,Fallout,cxb3mjv,1,t5_2qnzu

I think the standard wood wall pieces look fine as outer walls just corrugated iron and such.Place the first foundation as flush as you can on the highest most uneven point of your desired perimeter within reason and it should work but it will have to maintain the same level all the way around and there is a limit to how tall the concrete can be. I dont think you can step your walls up and down hills that way without a gap though but I did read something about a trick with spiked poles in Structures gt Wood gt Misc to get around the snapping problem. You can definitely stack concrete foundations on top of each other and control how high the bottommost one is so that might help.,Fallout,cxc0ar4,2,t5_2qnzu

Im starting to just assume my character has brain damage from being a human popsicle despite having  INT.And then theres talking to Father at the Institute. We have no way to actually have a conversation its just him thinking hes doing perfect and us being unable to ask questions like how do you not realize youve created human level intelligences? or why are your synths replacing people? or why are there so many of the older synths around attacking people? or getting to call him out on the synth killing the Commonwealth Provisional Government.

5774791,0,t1_cxcneaa,My ideal Fallout I think would be with Obsidian writing the majority of the storyline and companion arcs and then Bethesda doing most of the rest. Bethesda does a great job of passive storytellingtelling a story at a location using little things like the way objects and skeletons are positionedthat adds so much to the universe by giving these little glimpses into little moments of what things were like there prewar or what life in the wasteland was like for a regular person just trying to survive postwar. They create an amazingly detailed and nuanced environment thats absolutely packed with these little stories like the ArcJet building with its Mars program and their mishap with an overzealous reporter or at Dunwich Hugos Crater the Millers etc. and its something that I think was really lacking in New Vegas though its setting of the Mojave made this seem less obvious due to its far more sparse surroundings. But Obsidian did a great job of telling a more compelling main story giving you reason to feel personally invested in the events and the factions and also made the companions really seem alive and feel like they actually had character development and growth during the course of the game.

5775599,1,t1_cxcxh6w,gt In Fallout New Vegas you had even more options though. You can be generic good guy or evilevil but most of the relevant factions were morally grey. The Legion enslaved people belittled women crucified enemies and waged total war killing everyone in its path. Yet traders and many people living in Legion territory felt safer because they saw that the Legion  as horrible as they were  maintained order. You wouldnt see raiders attack settlements for fear of total annihilation by the LegionThis is ridiculous look the legion has  cons but this one little pro that is not gray that is one tone away from pitch black. Also the Legion wouldnt let raider gangs operate because they ARE the biggest raider gang just wth a roman flavor but they would absolutely destroy competition.,Fallout,cxd0mjc,-2,t5_2qnzu

Brotherhood of Steel is way too harsh and just die everyone fuckers. While Railroad is a bunch of save everyone so sweet you guys.Minutemen is just me helping a bunch of fuckers that cant do shit for themselfwhy the fuck can these guys not do stuff on their own? and its not like I can even make a special townmore below.Theres nothing that compels me to go for any of those on my first character where I play as the middle road that I qualify myself as. I kind of wanted to get into Brotherhood cause theyre more likeable imo in my view the characters that run it is just so boring. Ohhh bring me technical documents and go help this dude researching shit.I mean I really love Goodneighbour Id fucking love to make a town like that or something like that. Maybe a Diamond City style where the city runs a bit of itself instead of some small settlements with a cap of  people in it and I have complete control over every single person in it and even have to equip the guys with weapons if I want that. And no person really come by for the sake of coming by. Oh and especially I dont really like the way I can get far into the Brotherhood and then oh hi Railroad guys you dont have a problem with this guy here that has helped the guys that wanna kill all Synths right? Or that there is no problem at all bringing a fucking SynthNick to the fucking Brotherhood of Steel headquarter which I did first time I went there. Im like its pretty obvious I walk around with a synth behind me but sure go ahead and talk about killing all Synths ok no problem? Dont mind the guy I walk around with thanks. That being said I really like Fallout  its a really good game and have improved things over previous titles and lack a few things over previous titles if you ask me however I just dont want anything to do with any factions. Oh and I cant even decide not to be a part of the Minutemen.. Just let me fucking kill Preston and the other former minutemen guys and let me make my own faction that dont have the save the world shit story to it.. Let me make a faction for raiders that just are a crazy drugfueled bunch that go out and fuck everyone. Theres plenty of those people around why cant I get them to fucking join me? Like a quest I did yesterday where some dude tortured raiders and got them to join him. Edit Forgot to add why the fuck cant I kick people out of the Minutemen? Or refuse people? I mean Im the leader and sure the idea behind them is to help people but now I wanna be a part of Brotherhood of Steel oh wait I have a super mutant and ghouls in my freaking settlementsI am fairly sure the brotherhood story wise hate Ghouls as well?.

5781834,0,t3_3ucwzk,My first playthrough was a mess I rushed the main story because I was so impatient to see what happened and decided to restart halfway through. So Im not going to bother with summarizing my RP of that character. My current playthrough is with a guy named Shane. Had it in my head he was going to be a PSTDstricken guyturnedpsychotic cannibal but I scratched that idea very quickly. Hes just this kind slighty sarcastic guy looking to do good and desperately wanting to avenge his wifes death.My next playthrough is most likely going to be with a girl named Kate. Im RPing she had a rough upbringing and then enrolled in the military before law school which she hid from her husband and once he passed she became a nofucks given merc who isnt out to save the world but just to make it through the day without ripping someones throat out. ,Fallout,cxdsi1l,7,t5_2qnzu

5804030,0,t1_cxgi6xw,. The Institute does not care about the Commonwealth. This has been shown many many times with the atrocities they have committed.. The Institute is negligent about its research. Supermutants in Boston are a product of their experimentation and they have made no attempts to amend their mistakes.. The Institute has only done negative things to the Commonwealth for  years. What makes you think people will so readily accept them? Peoples fear of the Institute wont magically go away.. The Gen  synths project is pointless and is a road to nowhere.. The Cybernetics project was discontinued and would only lead to further tension between humans if it were brought back. People will still think the Institute wants to control them through their implants and they would be right. Also most people wouldnt be able to afford them and if they were free see point . . The scientists would be angry if you started making radical changes to their policies. Your control is not as absolute as you would believe. If you start making radical changes against the goals of the Institute the scientists would stop working or even riot.. The Institutes technology is not as advanced as it may seem. Previous games have shown further or similar advancements in technology and are more practical. The only thing the Institute has done thats truly noteworthy is teleportation and even then the Think Tank came up with it too. Society would be perfectly fine without the Institute. . Who would lead the Institute after the Sole Survivor died? The scientists wont be taking orders from Synth Shaun. Reintroducing cybernetics would likely lead to infighting within the Institute. This is a mess but Im sure theres more. Anything is better than the Institute in my eyes. Theyve been all promises and no results and that wouldnt change even if you were in charge. ,Fallout,cxgjmbg,-1,t5_2qnzu

5812116,0,t3_3uo3c5,Id love a Falloutgame where you actually get to experience Vaultlife after the bombs drop. Also I liked the prewar section. Getting to know your role in the vault hearing the feint thuds of people desperately drumming against the door for a few weeks trying to get in. My perfect scenario would be something like this The Vault of the imortals. A Vault where several strains of FEV are tested on a group of a couple hundred people. The result People who dont age like ghouls but without the tissuedamage. Contact to Vaultec is lost and a couple hundred people become more pretty fast. Your overseer declares procreation a crime punishable by death and food and water are highly rationalized. You start creating your character then wake up in pre war time. You prepare for the day watch some News while youre having breakfast then you gotta leave for work. As soon as you exit your house you can choose different working backgrounds by going to different places in front of you The diner on the other side of the road. Go there either slip into casual clothes and take orders then you are the waiterwaitress. You get a perk for charisma and agility. Alternatively go into the kitchen and start cooking then you are the cook getting a bonus on crafting and consuming food items. In the Vault people will come to you to refine their rations. A Vaultec bus. You drive to the local construction site for the Vault youre gonna be in. Youre just one of the workers who are responsible for the living areas. You get a bonus perk for repairs crafting buildings and you have a better knowledge of the Vault as you live in there. A RobCobus You drive to the RobCo RampDdepartment not far from your town. You are one of the leading engineers working on the new line of robots. You get a perk for craftingweapons armor robots general INTbonus and unique dialogue and options for postwar robots. Maybe you can choose from working on different projects making you an expert for certain robots or even giving you power armor training. A police car You get into the car to your partner driving to the local police department. Youre a cop therefore getting a bonus on charisma speaking with people and the use of small arms. Plus maybe a small dmgboost against raiders. An armyjeep Youre a soldier. You know your way around guns. You get a bonus to strength endurance and the use of rifles. Additionally you start with power armor training. Maybe you can even choose some weaponstraining giving you additional weaponbonuses. After a questchain at work you return home. You see a car in front of your house that you have to inspect allowing you to choose your relationship Ah my girl is home! Girlfriend is waiting for you. Cant wait to see my wife. Youve got a wife. Additional options for having male partners no matter what gender you are. Finally Why is the neighbour always parking in front of my house? You live alone. You have enough time for one or two hobbies giving you smaller perks to further modify your character. Additionally you can enjoy some pre war TV socialize in the diner on the other side of the road or go to the BBQ one of your neighbours is holding. Then starts the Vaultlife. You experience the terror of nuclear devastation the shocking realization that youre probably one of the last humans on earth the horror of people dying as the experiments start and the strange feeling of finding out that you dont age anymore. Vault life becomes routine you work in a job assigned to you by your previous life. Then one day the overseer has to cull the population again as the supplies get more and more sparse. You and the friends you made during your time in the Vault are the group that is going to be killed this time. But your group is the first one to manage to escape the Vault instead of being shot and then tossed outside. You put some distance between you and the Vault then you and your group start a small settlement in a decently intact building. Based on the jobs of your friends you get several perks in the settlementa doctor engineer provisionspecialist etc. But you wont make it alone and you need to know about the world youre in now. So you start exploring. ,Fallout,cxhjqdw,1,t5_2qnzu

5813693,0,t1_cxhq1u8,Ok maybe in the distant future they could expand that far without imploding but in five years? No fucking way. First they would have to officially set up shop in the Mojave which in their ending I believe they do. Then they would need to address governmental issues that would certainly arise from taking in more land and overstretching their military even more. After they do that then they would still have to carve through hundreds of miles of Legion territory to even reach the Midwest. Sure the Legion would be thrown into a disorganized state after losing there leaders and a chunk of there army in the Battle of Hoover Dam but Arizona would still be crawling with welltrained legionaries and regional leaders who know the territory much better than the NCR. A full invasion would be stupid after just barely pushing back a major offensive that almost broke them. And again they are already stretched thin as it is. Sending a force big enough to fight through enemy territory wouldnt be possible. Even if they managed that they would have to repeat the first two steps with the conquered Legion land and then press on to BoS territory. A BoS that is better trained better equipped and more stable than the Legion AND the NCR mind you. The NCR technically still has the numbers advantage but they wouldnt be able to utilize those numbers against the BoS because they are so far away from the core region. It would take a long time to get more troops to the front line and the troops they do have would be beaten and tired from all the fighting. Even if they could magically get a decent force to the Midwest the numbers advantage wouldnt be as big as it was with the West Coast BoS due to the Midwest BoSs recruiting of wastelanders raiders ghouls and even super mutants and deathclaws. They wouldnt be a match for the BoS if they went to war. At this point the central NCR would be falling apart due to the economic strain of a drawn out military campaign and expanding into land they cant defend properly. The outer territories would either rebel or get taken over by raiders. All of this is assuming they even try expanding past the Colorado River which they most likely wouldnt do initially.,Fallout,cxhqr5g,8,t5_2qnzu

I couldnt figure out why it was this far out but when I turned to watch it leave I realized there was a Deathclaw about  feet behind me.

5817578,0,t1_cx7qz5t,Even before any of that before there is a digression into the benevolence or maliciousness of each side I think that the first thing to be considered is what was the point of this game from the start? It was arguably to find your son. And once you find him you are now faced with a certain unshakable reality. He runs the institute. The past is the past. You cannot undo that he was stolen but you can make the future bright by continuing your sons central mission in this world. Bethesda does not give enough psychological attention to both the grief one might feel discovering his son is alive but who is also sick and dying and the weight of having to choose other factions such as the brotherhood or the railroad. Factions that the Sole Survivor really has no reason to support outside of the interest of lets see what happens. This is a video game after all but Fallout has always been about tying morality with emotion. Obsidian did this to a much better degree in Fallout NV than Bethesda does in Fallout . In fact this link morality and emotion was much better felt in Fallout  as well. If any of us finally found our son our blood in this horrid postapocalyptic world filled with violence and grief would we not do absolutely anything to spend time with him and keep him happy? I believe most people would. And couple this with the evidence that most who fear the institute often fear it because they either  do not understand and therefore fear technology or  they want to control technology given their own specific aims and objectives. Shaun Father is correct  the Institute is the brighter spot for the future existence of the commonwealth if not the whole world. Fallout  in terms of decision hierarchy should have set up many more barriers bw staying with ShaunThe Institute and making the choice to continue with the railroad or the brotherhood. Although not expedient from the instant gratification side of things which were all used to it would have made the game much more psychologically complex. Whether you are a father or you can perhaps put yourself in the shoes of a father  you would likely conclude that finding your son and aligning yourself with his visionary efforts would be the right thing to do. After all why did the Sole Survivor fight so hard and bleed so much to find Shaun? Why did he go through all the trouble of teleporting into The Institute? Did he do these things so that he could just turn his back on Shaun? It doesnt make sense. Choosing The Institute is the only choice that makes for a cohesive psychological narrative. ,Fallout,cxi83x9,4,t5_2qnzu

5845411,0,t1_cxlu9cw,And sorry for the double post but I have another idea of how Id really liek to see fast travel done in this game and most other games.  I think GTA has the best travel system with the taxis.  Need to get to the other side of the map? no problem. Wanna explore everything between here and there? Simple just sit back and watch the ride. Wanna go strait there? pay a small fee and skip jump in time.Specific to Fallout I want you to be able to track every traveling merchant and provisioner you meet so you can find the one nearest you then go to them and get a ride to the next town. At the least I think that should be an option cause sometimes I feel the fast travel is too easily abused and cheapens some experiences. ,Fallout,cxlv07z,1,t5_2qnzu

5857875,0,t1_cxm4n38,gtThe lack of choice is glaring especially considering Bethesda chose to stick to the one generic raider faction from FO after NV showed how differing factions could be incorporated. Imagine if the first choice was between helping Preston Garvey and thus the Minutemen or helping the Raider leader for personal gain He offers you choice of the spoils aka Power Armor and takes you back to their new camp. Had Raiders been given their own factions this would have opened up a whole new avenue of roleplay. Where you as the desperate parent decide to use this Raider faction optionally get to name it Tunnel Snakes anyone? to conquer the Commonwealth and search for your child. It could have led to Settlements being Raider Camps as you expand your influence challenges to your growing power from other Raider factions or groups.Oh man that would have been great. I dont mind the Minutemen being fairly naive idealists with no real moral faults but it would have been a lot better to have another settlement focused faction to act as their foil. And a named raider faction would have been perfect. I went into Fallout  expecting Fallout  with Skyrimesque streamlining. So I was impressed to see that it felt like they did learn some things from Obsidians work on New Vegas. And in their own Bethesda way tried to replicate that with the four factions in the Commonwealth. It was certainly an improvement over the railroaded main quest in Skyrim and the paltry attempt at faction conflict with Skyrims civil war.Had they implemented minor and small independent factions in FO I think it would have improved the overall game a lot. The generic raiders are the most glaring though. Which is weird because they put in all the legwork in making them their own unique factions of raiders but in the end didnt finish the job. Other than The Forged everyones just Raider despite all belonging to specific raiding groups with named leaders and their own backstory.,Fallout,cxnhv7r,1,t5_2qnzu

So where then is the future of humanity supposed to be heading? Further underground?His plans for humanity does not include any of the humanity above ground who are seen as experiments or resources ready for the taking. It is reductionism and science without morals at its depths.I felt disgusted when I saw how much they had and were hoarding.

5866992,0,t1_cxo70nw,Eh I think you might look again.For starters while in many cases there looks like theres always a best choice for gun crafting thats because youre approaching it from a unique perspective that makes it the best choice. Sure theres a best a choice for you a VATS using stealther for example but thats different than someone who cares more about hipfiring and charging in or another person based on Luckcrits or another who is building around burning or another who needs to choose lesser damage for a different ammo etc. There may not be a ridiculous amount of equally viable options but its nowhere near the kind of best gun  this with these mods you make it out to be.For example there are six I believe different guns that can be modded into a sniper rifle. Each of them have different pros and cons that range from weight suppression options ammo damage recoil reloadrecrank speed etc. There is no absolute best option there isnt even an absolute best base weapon.And to say thats the case with the entire crafting system is a bit of a misrepresentation especially since many of the options for armor and power armor are choosing one upgrade at the expense of others. Again there may be an obvious choice for you based on your playstyle but thats not everyones.,Fallout,cxoozct,2,t5_2qnzu

5869912,0,t3_3vnawt,gtFallout  is capable of altering the interior lighting to fit the time of day.        Fallout  and New Vegas actually had this methinks although it wasnt implemented nearly as well. An example that comes to mind although there are many if you look for them is the VAPL Power Station. Enter it mid day and the windows will have sunlight blaring out of them enter it after sundown and it will be dark and gloomy. Its nothing compared to  but its a nice effort.    gt signs and plaques found throughout the Commonwealth can be read directly inworld         and New Vegas also had this for instance the plaques inside of the Lincoln Memorial and various bits in the Museum of Technology. New Vegas had that monument in Boulder City and IIRC the plaques in the Repconn HQ could be read and both games have plenty of posters with small text that you can read if you have the graphics high enough.  Fallout  is of course by and large much better at this however.  and NV only really put the effort into this for important places that most people will look  has plenty of detail in even the most small and obscure corners.

5881788,0,t3_3vtab7,Excellent point. I think the Brotherhood definitely comes off as the most pragmatic of the four faction choices although frankly Im a little disappointed at how flat most of the choices are.Institute is unquestionably the evil choice. While I would argue that the Institute has by far the greatest potential to help the people of the Commonwealth after being made Director by Fatherspoiler the player has no actual ability to... direct. Youre locked in to the Institutes nefarious doings most of which make absolutely no sense. Frankly Im extremely dissatisfied with the Institute ending. Most of the evil things that the Institute does either go unexplained or the explanation makes absolutely no sense. Its completely bonkers that theyre as evil as they are.spoilerThe Railroad strikes me as the ideological choice. Theyre doing what they think is morally right but it leads to certain negative consequences the Institute storyline plays some of this out. Theyre not particularly wellequipped to actually protect the region I know Railroad Heavies start patrolling the wasteland after completing the main story for the Railroad but lets be honest that pretty much comes out of nowhere but theyre definitely the best good guy faction.The Minutemen bizarrely have the potential to a good mix of ideology and pragmatism but this isnt realized. The game portrays them as essentially failing at their most basic function if the player doesnt respond to settlement attacks theres no evidence the Minutemen pick up the slack the player has to personally respond to all distress signals etc. Additionally the Minutemen are designed to fail  the Sole Survivor is treated as the only reason the Minutemen are able to make a comeback leading to two possible bad outcomes in the event of the Sole Survivors death  disintegration or the rise of a tyrannical or inept leader.,Fallout,cxqmvmn,19,t5_2qnzu

Why would you ask someone to love a robot? Thats pretty much exactly what people in the Institute dont believe in. ShaunFather himself says this about Synths too. Also Im your fucking dad and youre having me go on all these dangerous ass missions with like  courser. Thanks bro Im sure you cant afford to keep your future director of the Institute alive with maybe.... more coursers?

It did not become common until large scale arc furnaces became available. Seeing as how I dont see any operating megawatt scale power plants in the wastes I dont see it as likely that there will be much aluminum refining going on.Of course if you have refined aluminum you can melt it down in a regular crucible.,Fallout,cxris2h,2,t5_2qnzu

You as the general of the Minutemen have to pass charisma checks for a local Minuteman to stand down.Dont get me wrong the MM are a bit extremely white but the problem seems to just be that the MM are too damn unorganized and lack any real structure.,Fallout,cxs53el,1,t5_2qnzu

5909877,0,t1_cxu9vu6,Nah I think its because even  years later practical concerns are still king.  The institute and the brotherhood have new stuff but even the most advanced of the other factions are just fighting to get by.  The majority of the robots arent exactly cooperative they are in their own groups and do their own thing.  Even diamond city only has like three.  The minutemen had a sentrybot and managed to beat down the raiders but they still had their shit kicked in by mirelurks and in the years since then life just got way harder for everyone else.Its likely that in the time before the fall of the minutemen there was new industry because people have fabric and leather but during the time of the game there is basically no industrial power under consistent control.  Diamond city has super mutants on its doorstep barely any settlements have existed for more than a few weeks or months and resources change owners like deacon changes clothes.  Diamond city is the only large settlement that has been around for at more than a couple years and it has no access to trees.  Covenant has been around a while has access to trees and is beautiful.In order to build a clean new house youd need to have a huge pile of lumber thats been sitting for a year or two.  To be able to collect wood in those quantities you need to have a stable home not have to worry about defending yourself and have plenty of free time thats asking a lot in the current situation.

Also why cant i find legendary power armor bits except the few bits you get from the vendor after youre a Paladin and from the elementary school field trip quest from commander Tuvok?

5928845,0,t1_cxnzpce,A. Roleplaying isnt just about backstory its also about character customisation and how you can interact with the world B. It doesnt hinge roleplaying to have a set past its when your characters life decisions are made for you that it crosses the line.Fallout  seriously lacks character customization compared to the other games. The other games had traits so you could make little quirks for your character and rather than you being able to make a character who was pretty much good at everything you could only take a limited number of perks  skill ranks and had to make very specialised characters rather than total badasses.Plus you could interact with the world a lot more. In the other games Dialogue wasnt limited to  choices so you could have a lot more choices on ways to respond the options werent limited to  key words so you knew exactly what youre character was going to say before they said it and most of the timeMaybe with the exception of Tobar in Point Lookout options werent entirely railroaded and you had the choice to say No or to take a different approach.Plus you had the choice to kill or betray your companions which you dont in FO. Also drug addiction was a more serious character flaw and either you had to suck it up or in NV go to rehab. The whole Adictol thing would be understandable did it work with Jet but because it works with all addictions it takes away from RP opportunities. Quests in other games also had alternate routes to completing them rather than simply being kill or gather quests.Another way that your interactions with the world are less immersive in FO is everything being combatbased. In the other games you could use Intelligence Charisma or Stealth to get out of tricky situations and deal with them in an alternate way to pew pew pew. In FO every perk and craft is either based around combat getting loot or something like that theres so little opportunity to use noncombat skillsLastly in the other games despite having set backstories your characters choices arent defined for them let me demonstrateFallout  Yes you came from a vault you would have no choice whatsoever about being born in one but you can decide your characters job how he responded to other vault dwellers his life choices ect. the only thing that really binds you is your place of birth. You were sent to find a waterchip but the reason you were sent could be a variety of reasons Maybe the Overseer disliked you maybe he thought you could do it maybe it was a random draw ect. It doesnt limit your character customization at all.Fallout  Yes you came from a tribe called the Arroyo and were a descendant of the Vault Dweller but thats all you know. Your character is a blank slate you could be a naive tribal someone hoping to become a shaman a fierce warrior a treasured scout a trader ect. the only other things that are defined are A. You were sent to find a G.E.C.KGiven you have a specific set of skills that helped you complete Temple of Trials may be whySo as we can see all that is defined in fallout  and  is the circumstances of your birth the fact that you have a set of some kind of skills and that you were considered suitable for the missionAnd that you did the Temple of Trials. None of your choices whatsoever are defined Fallout  defines a lot more about your character than the other games. Firstly you are in a heterosexual marriage with a son. Granted it wouldnt make sense to have alternative family types in a s retro futurism but surely if your character was closet gay or the kinda person who never wanted kids they could just never marryThough it was an almost universal norm there were some exceptions. You are kinda forced to conform to the norms of the time.Plus youre forced to name your son Shaun. What if you really hated the name Shaun for whatever reason?Plus your job is defined for you. Female Sole Survivor is a Lawyer Seems realistic if you are playing a character with an Int and Cha of . What if your character would have never chosen that line of work? What if she wanted to be a housewife?The fact that male Sole Survivor is a soldier isnt as restricting as you could easily play the Conscription Card but the live action intro sceneMay not even be cannon shows him looking at a picture of Nora showing that he genuinely cares about her meaning its much harder to play him as an emotionless sociopath. Plus he gives an inspiring speech which takes away from it if you are playing a dumb brute man of few words or vulgar asshole.Also on a minor note The Sole Survivors dialogue always sounds quite intelligent even if you have Intelligence . In the other games you had incredibly funny and dumbed down options if you had low enough intelligence and in  and  you could completely miss out on some opportunities because of it.,Fallout,cxwswr3,1,t5_2qnzu

5938900,0,t1_cxy3nae,It sounds like we actually agree on most points. I very much enjoyed Fallout  for what it was. I have two playthroughs and  hour sunk into it to attest to that. However I recently got bored with it and I decided to finally go back and play the original game I like many started with FO. Its primitive to be sure but now that Ive played through about half of it I  understand why the people who started with the originals are upset about the direction the franchise is moving in. Really I think the discussion boils down to a few evaluations that have to be made. . Is Fallout  a good game? I would respond with a resounding yes.. Is Fallout  an RPG? Strictly speaking I would say its an action RPG so yes.. Is Fallout  a good RPG? This ones a little fuzzier for me because it depends on your operational definition for good RPG. I would say that its a mediocre RPG. It has a story and you can roleplay to a limited degree but the writing is pretty bad in places and it has some plot holes.. Is Fallout  a good Fallout game? By that I mean is it in the spirit of the series as a whole as set up by the Black Isle games? On this point I would have to say no. In the same way that I dont think Skyrim was a good Elder Scrolls game although a good game overall too much is oversimplified and stripped down. Part of the Charm of a Fallout game playthrough is the limitations placed on your character. This is the first game in the series that doesnt have that. If you keep grinding you can be a master in every skill and have  in every S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat  for bobbleheads.,Fallout,cxy4c3d,2,t5_2qnzu

5942962,0,t1_cxym3wg,I didnt mean to say Obsidian copied bethesda somehow. I figure when new vegas came out fallout  was already in development for quite some time being done by everyone who wasnt busy putting on the final bugs touches in skyrim.I figure Bethesda saw what obsidian was trying to do and then attempted to do it right. And then failed in new and exciting ways...I didnt say the enclave was new i know it was recycled from fo. I did say that i liked them better than whomever you might decide to shoot at in fo or rather i like killing enclave more then deciding which morally grey option to take. Or rather again i like shooting the enclave better than finding out that there are pretty much only bad guys.Who is the bad guy here? The Insticlave believing everything but themselves to be below them ironically because of some percieved genetical superiority untainted by radiation?Or maybe the Brotherhood of Steal because we will protect you from technology by stealing it from you who went from being the good guys in fo to lording their technological superiority literally over everyone? Why dont you name your Ship Hindenburg already?I was trying to say that Obsidian was attempting to make one of their factions to be less good and failed at that. Thankfully i might add.Bethesda tried to make their factions less good and they have succeeded. And then they went a million miles too far and made at least two factions into what would pass as a villain in any other game.So in the end i like this NCR which might be considered a failure on obsidians part for being too nice better than the successes from Bethesda.At this point i wouldnt even mind if Bethesda made up another faction thats the same as the enclave or the legion or any other bad guy in all but name. Let me be the good guy again. Now im choosing between nazis and NaziSlavers? Just let me shoot some bad guys.This is not an attack against Bethesda really Bioware has thrown about a million moral dilemmas at me and succeeded exactly once. And they are as good at storytelling as you can get with modern video gaming industry.This one partsuccess in Mass effect  is the high point of moral dilemma because to this day i honestly can not tell you what the good outcome is.Brilliantly it is part of a sidequest. So you get to make the hard decisions and also you get to save the world and feel good about it.Well Bethesda has me make hard Decisions but fails at making me feel good about saving their gameworld and the latter is to me much more important.As for the copypasta i honestly dont mind that. Recycle old ideas all you want but please use that as a scaffolding to hang your few new ideas from as well.The original idea of the enclave was itself not very original. A shadow government that secretly controls the Government? That Idea is so old that i reckon that Conspiracy theorists are probably thinking that the shadow government theory was brought up by the government to distract from the real truth. Which of course is out there! hums xfiles themeWell the shadow government idea is rather old but the enclave that sprung from that turned out rather well.,Fallout,cxynho4,-1,t5_2qnzu
5943077,0,t1_cxymp3f,Im honestly not quite sure that the Libertalia synth was a failure. The Institute might be placing synths on the surface with their simulated free will and with enough information to let them believe that they are humans. We can find some terminal entries that document how Synths where outfitted with human memories not that of a certain target to be switched out although that happens as well but rather to just have the Synth run around to the first group of humans and integrate themselves naturally. That way the synth is seemingly above all suspicion when serving in a city council in the Brotherhood or anywhere for years or even decades.The Institute has Synths in some high ranks of certain organizations without those organizations or even the synths themselves knowing.We also know that the Institute can put command triggers in a Synths brain to be triggered whenever they please. So one day you might find yourself killing your wife and children because you where a synth without knowing it and your trigger has been switched to the murder setting.For all we know the Libertalia synth might have been one of a great many synths and this ones simulated free will brought him onto the raiders career ladder.Perfect for the institutes goals to prevent the commonwealth from stabilizing.But now we have this new person here Fathers parent supposedly who must be shown that Synths must be recaptured lest they would do harm on the surface.I figure the institute wouldnt give a crap about raiders. On the opposite theyd love some help in annoying any entity who would attempt to stabilize the Commonwealth.,Fallout,cxyo173,26,t5_2qnzu

5980286,0,t3_3xcvtv,I purchased it after hearing about all the hype. I had played Skyrim before and thought it was overall quite solid so I decided I would go for Fallout .After playing for  hours in the first week I got the game I can say that its a ton of fun. I feel like I have responsibilities within the game and its just very immersive for me personally. While I would like more RPG aspects and more speech options as sometimes they feel far too limited to even enjoy somethings I really love it.It is certainly my favourite game within my collection currently and I will continue to play it. However I am planning on picking up both  New Vegas and  to give them both a shot and see how they differ and are possibly better in some ways.Cheers.,Fallout,cy3jp3m,22,t5_2qnzu

6035153,0,t3_3y3x97,I think what ruined it for me was the ending cut scene. The endings in combat were still similar but they were more varied than NV which was a good thing. What gave me a bad taste is how the ending slides made me feel like nothing I did mattered. It felt even less varied than s but it felt like a joke next to   and NV. In those the ending slides kind of showed you how much your actions mattered for better or worse. In comparison  of the  endings have the same exact ending slides verbatim and the only difference is the Institute ending which still reuses the majority of the asset.I never really cared for the karma system. Overall Id say it did some things better than NV the battles were a but more varied and felt like they had a greater scale to them when it came to the ending but mostly list to NV.As per  Id say its an improvement compared to FO without dlc in every way. With DLC  has the edge of boasting that your actions have an after story. Still even if there are only two ending slides in  it improves by letting you side with one of four factions including the evil one aka Institute much like the Legion,Fallout,cyaq1wa,1,t5_2qnzu

6042129,0,t1_cyblr45,Thats fair. I just find a lot of those places you revisit kindof needless because you only revisit them because theyre full of enemies. Or because you got a quest that they just magically cleared junk out of the way for. You cant retrieve a lot of them ahead of time. You see more gears.  More importantly my first character was blind focused on his son. He didnt help people until he hit that weird lull in the game. And really I didnt find that many people to help that werent tied to settlements. I did fine some not to be disingenuous. To be fair I did avoid some of them because I knew Id be replaying with other characters. I DID have the same problem with the Divide though. My next couple characters will explore it more.Thanks for sharing the outlook. I do think its a shame that New Vegass visit reasons seem more limited. Theres one interesting things that happen if your revisit Primm but I wish more was done with Nipton and Goodsprings. I think those were failures more of time than anything and I think even I get thrown off sometimes on the differences in those.  vs  years. BUT Fallout  focused that time into adding a lot. I just wish theyd taken  years and really expanded on the story and quest flexibility more. But then would the graphics freaks have complained even HARDER?

Because they have no in game place to go to apply FEV to people like the DC supermutants did. And STILL had nothing to show for it until Virgil went rogue in his experiments. They were just running the same exact experiment constantly for all those years. They killed a farming family and replaced them with synths for their experiments. For all their technological innovation at the cost of Bostons blood power and water which the second  theyve tapped directly into they give nothing back. Theyll kill you or anyone else for tech check out one of the universities south of Diamond city. A little girl found some old computer stuff and she tells a trader who will buy it from her. He tells the Institute and instead of just buying it they attack her. And they actively employed a child killing mercenary asshole as their faceman. Not to mention for some reason actively trying to create increasingly human robots. Who they then control without mercy. Even if the Gen  synths arent real people do you think theyd stop there? No theyll keep making synths more and more human until it IS slavery. And theyll never admit it because they have no concept of guilt for their actions. Anything for science is justified. Hell at least Big Mt had the excuse of being stuck in a loop that prevented true learning from their actions.The NPC Institute doesnt mention their actions because its not a big deal to them.

6063028,0,t3_3yiyaa,Ive toyed with the idea of a mod that would have you join a single raider gang The Redcoats who act as counterparts to the Minutemen. You grow your influence by getting other gangs to ally with you as settlements. Radiant quests would send you to raid and massacre opposing faction strongholds often settlers or raider forts but sometimes BoS gunners etc.. Im thinking you would have to choose to join the Redcoats or the Minutemen in Concord mutually exclusive factions and perhaps the other faction survives and tries to build a resistance against you over the course of the questline. This method could rehash a lot of the Minutemen scripts and plot points already in game so it seems pretty viable  of course this is said without having seen what those assets look like an editor mind you,Fallout,cyecu0t,1,t5_2qnzu

Outside of VATS the Ripper is pretty useful it makes short work of lesser rank enemies but you dont accumulate criticals so thats a downside.Rooted Blitz and all crit perks from Luck tree are pretty much all you need.,Fallout,cyfzmpd,4,t5_2qnzu
6075637,0,t1_cyfutpd,Radscorpions do not follow Fallout  rules it follows Fallout  rules where they are the biggest threat for the first half of the game due to their very potent poison.The best strategy for radscorpions is to not engage them on equal terms at all just like the classics. That is stick to the trade roads until you get a big enough gun to take them on and a steady supply of antidote. When you do fight scorpions make sure you never let them close the distance on you and never fight them in close quarters. Just like the originals.Damage is also redone to follow fallouts original rules which were based largely on real life. You cant tank damage here because that is a gamey concept in the first place unless you have power armor.Classic fallouts main thing was that you are mortal and you were just as frail as anyone else.The story is just a framing device for the canvas that is the world and your choices and interactions are the brush. This is the classic fallout doctrine. You havent gotten to the point where it truly opens up.Quitting before Vegass story opens up is like quitting Fallout  before anyone mentions project purity. You havent gotten to Vegass project purity.You also arent here to have some emotional talk with a fake dad or trying to save the wasteland. Because the West Coast wasteland was already saved over  years ago when the Unity war ended. Then saved again  years ago by an arroyo tribal.You are here to interact with a living world and see it rebuild and at the end of the game see where it goes depending if you intervened or not.You are not meant to wander in any direction you please because you are mortal and the world has events that not all mortals can handle at the very start.You cant just walk through the front line of the Masters Army in the Unity war just like a real war You cant walk through a burning building in real life and you cant walk through an area thats quarantined due to a deathclaw infestation. You need preparation to handle situations like this.Dont play this like Fallout  because Bethesda changed the rules so it would be more accessible and easier for newcomers.

Despite there being a few things people have mentioned i.e. Somerville being in the wrong spot theyve done a great job. I mean they even have some local Southie spots like Castle Island Sullivans a hot dog stand right there and Murphys Law. Everything in Boston proper they did a really detailed job with but outside the city it gets a bit murky. The thing is a lot of Boston as we know it today was built in the s and s outside of the colonial landmarks. So they couldnt include some of the main skyline you might recognize from seeing images of the skyline due to the aesthetic. Unlike the Assassins Creed that was set in colonial Boston they did actually have the geography mostly right. ,Fallout,cyhis42,3,t5_2qnzu

He knew the bombs were coming and he know when he just wasnt allowed to say anything. When the VaultTec salesman came to the door that was the secret tip off that things were about to go down.

He says there are many strains of FEV at play in the Commonwealth meaning the Institute were creating new strains regularly.

I for example did not find sailing around on WWs big empty ocean to be especially charming.I would also challenge that statement comparing FO and FONVs map to FOs. One of the biggest arf arf reasons FOs map feels bigger than those of the previous two titles is because Ive taken advantage of fast travel far less here than in those games thanks in no small part to there being more points of interest on the map. Refraining from teleporting everywhere is much more rewarding when there are mildly interestingamusing or cool things to stumble across as opposed to simply traversing empty spacethat makes fast travel more attractive not less.Even after marathoning FO well over the hundred hour mark I can still run across neat little nooks and crannies like an unmarked subway interior showcasing Bethesdas trademark environmental storytelling... and ever so rarely an entirely new location. Thats cool and one of the games greatest strengths.Its an understatement to state that I would vastly prefer to stumble over more superblydesigned unmarked locations like the parking garage near Fallons than kill a few more giant mosquitoes on the way to my true destination.

Many Institute characters will tell you outright that they think the surface Commonwealth population is a lost cause and would be better off dead.Technology is great but in the wrong hands its more trouble than its worth. This is especially true in the logic of the Fallout universe. The Institute is basically the Enclave but with a teleporter and synths instead of vertibirds and power armor.Sure you can argue that all the Institute needs is good leadership and conveniently the PC can become the leader of that faction in defiance of all logic.

6184765,0,t1_cysmh1m,There are a few reasons I preferred Morrowind over Oblivion Quest Markers I loved Morrowinds dialog amp journal based quest location descriptions. It made you think and made the game that much more of an adventure rather than just following an objective marker.   Fast Travel I vastly preferred Morrowinds fast travel via boats Mages Guild and silt striders forcing you to walk quite a ways if youre out in the field and thinking about the most efficient combination of modes of travel  as well as giving value to the Mark amp Recall spells and other less conventional modes of travel. It also made the world feel a lot larger not being able to go anywhere instantly just because youve been there before.   Dialog I much preferred Morrowinds textbased dialog because it allowed a team to create significantly more content and more complex dialog without having the headache of recording voiced lines for everything. This also allowed for seamless modded NPCs and questlines instead of the voice acting in Oblivion mods recorded with subpar equipment by obviously amateur voice actors which was a complete pain to get set up to begin with because the audio format was finicky and lip syncing was a pain in the ass.   Skills amp Equipment I hated how Oblivion reduced the number of skills and the diversity of equipment. While many would consider Morrowinds system tedious I loved it. Having different skills for Short Blade and Long Blade rather than just Blades and Blunt and having different slots for Left and Right Gloves Pauldrons and Boots was novel to me.That said I still loved the crap out of Oblivion and even Skyrim but its a shame how they stepped away from Morrowind. Sure the graphical and mechanics improvements were cool but I dont think they were worth the reduced novel organic complexity.,Fallout,cysn6hy,3,t5_2qnzu

6197858,0,t1_cyu3x4u,Honestly youre overestimating the amount of RPG elements in Skyrim. Most decisions you had were very arbitrary and held no weight at all and most of the quests were very much the same thing. Most of the open world despite being smaller than Fallout  looked pretty much the same. It was all just snow and some woods here and there. Dont even get me started on the dungeons.The story in Fallout  although flawed is a lot more engaging than Skyrim. The factions arent perfect but they actually have meaning to the overall plot. Ive only had two  hour playthroughs in Fallout  so far but the Commonwealth ended up a very different place in both of them.  Locations are more varied the gameplay is more fun the graphics are more polished and the animations dont look like complete ass for once.

You also assume that the repair system would not be modified as well e.g. degradation could be far slower WRK could be more effective WRK could have lower weight or it could be easier to repair guns.I do not believe saying that you have to carry a ton of WRK around is a legitimate argument when the most I would ever carry around is . Regular trips back to base make this a nonissue so unless youre going for a nomad playthrough you shouldnt need to carry that much around with you. Also Pack Rat perk which is amazing on hardcore mode reduces WRK weight to ..I think the Ill save it for later mentality is something that will never go away. Ammo scarcity is biggest offender for this in my experience. I dont think there is anything wrong with some weapons having drawbacks ammowise or repairwise not everything needs to be a direct upgrade. If youre unwilling to maintain your equipment when the game has given you a perfectly viable way to do so then maybe you shouldnt shift the blame onto the repair system.,Fallout,cywbvoz,-1,t5_2qnzu

I also feel same sort of an attachment to Fallout  since everything seems so personal to me especially the main story and the relationship with the companions. Voiced protagonist helps a lot in my opinion. Thats the only way I can explain the feeling these two games give to me. It just feels personal and when it hits  it hits hard. Fallout New Vegas is something completely different if you ask me. Its a game where you get to create your character the way you want no personal story whatsoever you just get shot and patched up and you create yourself the way you want to. Maybe thats why I dont like it in the same way I like the other two games but it is a completely different kind of game despite being mostly the same.,Fallout,cz1gvr5,1,t5_2qnzu

6264671,0,t1_cz0erzw,I also sided with the railroad. Other than basically destroying the brotherhood it seemed to be the lesser of all evils. I played all sides up until I needed to choose. I knew Id have to get rid of them but part of me still felt it was unnecessary bloodshed to blow up the brotherhood. Regardless of their antisynth and lust for tech hoarding personalities the brotherhood was cleaning up the Commonwealth of ghouls raiders and supermutants. I saved Danse of course but I wish that step could have allowed for a truce between the RR and BoS even if that makes just as much sense as the brotherhoods closemindedness. They came to the Commonwealth to destroy the Institute and their technology. My only real qualm with being able to play all sides is that inability to be the bridge and create a temporary truce to allow all sides to finish their ultimate goal.As for the institute they created self aware people and kept them as slaves brought the FEV to the commonwealth and remorselessly experimented on the Commonwealths people. They killed communities replaced real people with copies or supermutants and were fully unwilling to help the Commonwealth as everyone in it was lost to them and therefore a waste of time.Regarding shaun in my cannon my sole survivor began to consider his son died with his wife shortly after actually interacting with the real shaun. The infant was replaced with a cancerous and compassionless man who was curious to see if you had the capability to survive. I was an experiment. If that synth child worked when I arrived I almost feel like shaun wouldnt have revealed himself to me treated it like an experiment. So yeah I agree. Railroad seems like a mostly satisfying ending. Come to terms with the fact this man isnt your son just shares genetics with you save the Commonwealth from being victims of heinous experimentation and allow the innocents from the Institute to escape and hopefully begin their progress again with the resources I the one who saved them basically can provide as general of the minutemen. The last part feels important because they are really the only ones trying to unite and protect the Commonwealth. With accomplished scientists I feel like it seems the brightest way to the future.,Fallout,cz1q1n8,3,t5_2qnzu

6366547,0,t3_42uu5a,At the moment I think the most likely course would be something between the two possibilities.  Firstly regarding paid mods and microtransactions Im of the opinion that Bethesda will likely revisit the issue again someday in the future.  Maybe itll be with Fallout  maybe it wont.  The paid mods experiment failed for Skyrim because as Bethesda themselves put it it was a bad idea to try it with a wellestablished modding community.  This particular phrasing led to me predicting that Fallout  would have paid mods from the start.  I was wrong but I dont think were out of the woods yet.  On the other hand the vehement community reaction towards Skyrims paid mods may have made Bethesda wary towards the whole concept itself.  So while they might not have abandoned it altogether I dont think theyd go overboard like Overkill have.  Expect Bethesda to dip their toes into the paid mod or microtransaction field again in the future possibly with Fallout .  Regarding further expansions and support... well I think youre being too optimistic here.  Bethesdas never been known to patch their games to a  stable or bugfree state.  If they did there wouldnt be a need for unofficial patches.  So I think constant support might be a bit overoptimistic given Bethesdas previous record.  And even if Obsidian is given the reins for another Fallout game something I personally consider unlikely theres still no indication that Fallout  will take elements from it for the better.  After all Fallout  did not incorporate some of the more popular elements of New Vegas such as hardcore mode.  Instead it went off on its own path such as with the extensive crafting system and simplified RPG mechanics.  So what I think will happen is that in terms of support and future games Bethesda will continue to do their own thing.  In terms of paid mods and microtransactions were not out of the woods yet but things probably wont get very bad right away.  ,Fallout,czdb1ei,5,t5_2qnzu

I put a lot of time into trying different character types and perk setups.  I am not one to just say a game is bad the game is not a bad game.  It is really well made for what it is.  The mechanics as a shooter are solid the guns can be fluffy feeling at times but they are solid.  On the other hand as a open ended bethesda title it fails.  I am a role player other bethesda games had much better immersion for this role playing aspect.  The way they designed fallout  it removed this for me.  I can not be what my character wants to be because of the way they set up the core history of the characters.  This is what I mean by immersion.   Sure all beth games have a storyline but the characters were always more broad then what we got.  I feel the biggest mistake they made was starting pre bomb drop.I am glad you love the game it is great for what it is.

Even trying to be evil doesnt feel truly evil because the game is set on its own rails of trying to make their story make sense.For what my opinion is worth I feel NV made every choice you made have a bigger impact on you than FO ever did. Thats mainly due to having better writing and dialogue. It makes your choices matter that much more unlike in FO.The only example you came up with the world acknowledging you doing something evil is with your companions. Something a lot of people agree FO did right. But thats really it. The world itself doesnt reach to it.,Fallout,czke2sj,1,t5_2qnzu

Its never pressing and you have no reason to look into it. And it takes even longer into the main quest to even know what is going on at all and they still more or less allow you to not care about it in dialogue and not do it. You can have your character be uninvested. And the Lone Wanderer is also able to straight up say they dont give a shit about their dad and dont want to look for them the only reason you have to leave the vault isnt even to find them its cause you would be killed once you get out you can wholly blow off your dad because you dont care because he got you kicked out of the vault and go be a slaver dick if you want.

6517667,0,t3_44sgi2,I agree with most of the sentiments in this post and thread. While I generally like Fallout  and dont think its nearly as bad as most people make it out to be I even enjoy settlement building you run dry on quests at least interesting and varied quests very quickly. I basically stopped doing the main quest after I left the institute because I realized that by continuing it all I would be doing is cutting myself off to a large amount of content and locations no matter who I sided with I screwed myself out of the Minutemen path because it wasnt made apparent that they were even an option to side with in the first place and Preston kind of sucks anyway. I also was just no longer interested in the story once it was clear that the Institute really didnt have much of a motivation beyond Science! It was boring and didnt explain the horrific things theyre accused of in a satisfying way at all. When I found out that no matter which faction you side with the main quest just goes on to be Destroy those other two factions now because reasons! without any other way to solve the conflict it did not appeal to me at all. Not to mention that as so many others have said the quests all generally end one way with maybe a pseudodecision thrown in there that may or may not affect the outcome in the end. It just seems like they missed so many opportunities by not adding in more decisions and outcomes and instead railroading you on a path of destruction despite the apparent openness of the beginning.,Fallout,czth76f,3,t5_2qnzu

There are  endless ways to change the outcome of your experience following in true Fallout fashion through dialouge choices and the occasional bullet to the face. You like many of other fans have what I like to call Hype Blinders. You expected the best game that ever existed out of FO and now that your unreachable desires have not been met you have to grossly overcriticize what to a lot of people is a great game hell maybe their favorite game. I can totally understand that some aspects of the game were not what you expected I feel the same way. But saying that there is only  choices total in the game is absurd and leads me to believe that you did only the main quest once you left the vault and none of the amazing side quests.

During the Cold War Britain had the worlds densest collection of nuclear targets and the aftermath of a nuclear war would likely have driven Britain in real life into a quasimedieval state of affairs from which the country would never recover.Putting a Fallout game into Britain would be absurd.

Any weapon mod that decreases the per shot damage of a weapons base damage actually gets more out of the two shot prefix as the second shot added is the unmodded base damage of the weapon.  You experience a greater dps boost.  I have both a two shot gauss and an instigating gauss and the two shot is more useful across more situations.  If an enemy has even one hit point of damage then the instigating is just a stock gauss.  No enemy can withstand a sneak attack shot from a two shot or instigating gauss so the one situation where the instigating reliably does more damage than the two shot its really just overkill.

But if youre putting out a premium product a product which I purchased an XBox to play in a storied franchise then you have an obligation to deliver on the franchise not a watered down version of it.  I get it now Bethesda can market to lazy gamers and  year olds.  But those demographics are mutually exclusive with yuppies with disposable income and a fully functioning cerebral cortex.Because of my love for NV and FO I preordered FO.  I now think that this was a mistake.  I know it is typically a mistake to preorder any game but Bethesda had delivered on an excellent RPG before.  This time they only delivered an excellent shooter.  I will not be purchasing FO but instead Ill simply buy the newest CoD GoW etc.  I dont love those formats but at least they deliver on the game archetype that they advertise.,Fallout,d0628di,1,t5_2qnzu

Fallout  was marketed as an RPG and its an open world adventure game. Its a sequel to Skyrim not Fallout . Its in the same genre as Far Cry Just Cause and Grand Theft Auto.

I agree that Fallout  is fun and the world is incredibly welldesigned and beautiful but there are legitimate criticisms against some gameplay decisions. I really really dont like that speech checks are essentially gone. All skill checks really. And they dont even need to be! That all couldve been rolled into SPECIAL checks for example  CHARISMA  I dont want to fight and you know Ill kill you if it comes to that.

6802218,0,t1_d0n74kl,Okay some advice for you dont know if you need it. You seem fully aware and prepared that it is a huge project that will take years. Go for a modular approach. Dont plan the entire mod and then start doing everything at once. Rather than starting on the entire landmass before continuing with all NPCs and then all quests for example go for a small part of the landmass then the NPCs and quests for that part only.It allows for faster testing ingame and gives a better sense of progress both for yourself and for others. For yourself a better sense of progress keeps motivation higher and helps you endure the slumps and tough times that will happen during such a demanding project.For others a better sense of progress helps to show that you are willing to put in the work which is the only possible recruitment tool for modding. It makes it easier for them to help you out with the parts you have problems with.Worst comes to absolute worst it allows for easier descaling of the project and makes an unfinished release actually have some draw for others either to play or to pick up. Instead of just being a loose collection of objects that never got ingame and only stands as a lesson to keep mods simple.,Fallout,d0nbosp,2,t5_2qnzu

Cities in the West had numbers in the tens targeting many of its cities. Salt Lake City was flattened. Los Angeles was hit so hard that all of the buildings within the city were flayed leaving behind only the skeletons of its buildings. Parts of Los Angeles Orange County for one were even vaporised Even just accounting for the amount of resources expended on the cities in the West seems to suggest that the West was hit harder. Salt Lake City was targeted by  warheads. New Vegas was targeted by five times that. East Coast? DC was hit by a few weaker stragglers. Boston was hit by... One. The East Coast was spared most of the horrors of the Great War compared to the West and yet it was the West that had civilisation springing back to life within twenty years.

I think this is a real big scumbaggery assuming that Shaun doesnt know about Quicksave and Load. Maybe the game wants to show that sometimes it happens that you just cant go the peaceful way no matter what you do. If there are factions that hate each other so much and have a history of blood and violence a single manwoman just cant bring them to peace even if he becomes leader of one of the factions. I understand that you may be infected by the Hollywood world view that the good aka American guy always wins and everyone is happy in the end but FO may have a more realistic view on the world except for technical and science development and wants to show you that sometime things are just too fucked up for a happy end.On the other side you could side with the minutemen or the railroad where you dont have to kill a bunch of innocent people but only kidnappers killers and torturers.

6838169,0,t1_d0r9poj,Agreed. Its very obvious the Institute was rewritten at some point from The Master meets the Enclave to the benevolent but misguided were just trying to help but are misunderstood. Some of the dialog in game still retains this Kellogs memories he refers to the leader of the Old Institute as the Old Man twice but at the second time it Shawn was the head of the Institute first time Shawn was too young to be the head and says Synth Shawn is bait. He couldnt know that since Father hadnt released the Sole Survivor yet and wouldnt for several more years.Giving Synths emotions makes for zero logical sense for a dedicated workforce with bio organic computer brains. It makes hell of a lot of sense if you are planning to replace a lot of people and you want them to blend in. Danse doesnt have any logic to being a Synth but someone dug up files showing his objective was to infiltrate the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steels leadership and destroy them from the inside out.In current lore they needed Shaun to finish the synths for DNA reasons but theyre clearly using other peoples dna to replace them. Always in circumstances where bribery would work a hell of a lot better.The Midwestern Brotherhood would have made for a more logical faction. Having super mutants sentient deathclaws AIs robots and tribals in their group they wouldnt blend back into the Western Brotherhood of Steel and wouldnt seek to destroy the Institute but capture it like they did Vault  for its technology. The Railroad would be trying to help misguided sentient machines as apposed to malfunctioning in a literal impossible way synths.

But I dont believe Bethesda would ever do that honestly its been their style to push towards more and faster gratification for over a decade now. You level up faster in Fallout  than you did in Skyrim which was faster than Fallout  etc.The perksonly system though was a solution in search of a problem. It was a poor idea implemented badly.

Fallout s engine is an even more heavilymodified variant of Skyrims including several major updates most notably moving to a bit setup.So yeah while its an evolution of Gamebryo the FOera Creation Engine is a very different beast youd have an easier time completely remaking New Vegas in FOs engine than you would converting NVs files to FO.,Fallout,d0umaxp,3,t5_2qnzu

Shaun was more of a template than anything else as far as I can tell.Apparently the Institute also made use of FEV in order to effect at least the skin as well. Does this mean that you would be getting frisky with the Master by proxy? Definitely not.There is no reason to think that synths are your grandchildren or anything like that.

Level  after DLC.The melee character is level  and zero gun perks all points are around survival and damage.  The big bot behind the annoying brain died in a single VATS use.  She doesnt have the INT for chemist and doesnt have the same uptime for chems as the first guy.On both characters Im taking the hit for not getting Lone Wanderer perks since I have Ada along too.I have two other characters.  One is bad that I have perk points all over the placelvl.  He was sort of my shakedown to see how perks work well with eachother.

Spitz The aqua blue Mr Handy Provisioner floating along with his little herd of Brahmin between the Castle and the Machinists lair.

Caps Cola and Chems. Of course as a robot he physically cant consume two of the three and we dont pay him. So he has to make do with picking up any caps he finds on the submarine provisions route between the Castle and Spectacle Island which he was unlucky enough to be assigned to because his attitude is best described as Flying Nazeem. Fritz Fritz. The big boy. This is what happens when you combine the best salvaged technology of General Atomics Robco and the Brotherhood of Steeland possibly a few set scale console commands. all done under the watchful eye of the Institute. Armed with a laser gatling gun and a missile launcher he floats high above The Castle prepared to suplex the next Mirelurk Queen to show up into the stratosphere.

There are also certain torso armor mods that have skulls. For instance the Warmonger rear torso mod has skulls poking out of the top and it looks fucking awesome. There are also some for assaultron helmets. The skulls are stuck to certain mods and cant be placed independently on characters. Btw Ahab is made entirely out of the warmonger mods and can be remade in a settlement which looks incredibly badass and can lead to a unique role play of you capturing the rust Devils base and stealing their prized possession.

7045508,0,t1_d1errcw,Sorry you were being downvoted as I think your analysis was pretty spoton.Its honestly an interesting question because canonically Li left long before Maxson was even a blip on anyones radarremember the Maxson that we knew in F was an awkward kid whose defining character trait was a major crush on Sarah Lyons. Hes pretty much the personification of the trope From Nobody To Nightmare.In the end the reunification with the Outcasts was pretty much a complete ideological victory for the latter faction. Sure they compromised on the issue of outsiders they now very obviously recruit from the wastelander population and they probably do maintain the pretense of helping out otherwise there wouldnt be any new recruits but its very clear that the Brotherhood which Maxson runs isnt the fauxchivalrous knightly order Lyons envisioned. It was less a reunfication and more an outright annexation of the Lyons faction by the Outcasts.Given her intelligence Li probably saw the writing on the wall after the victory at Project Purityand given both of the Lyons were dead within a year after F it was probably wise not to stick around to count on his continued benevolence.,Fallout,d1eysoh,3,t5_2qnzu

7077270,0,t3_4chcys,I admittedly spent about  hours playing today starting a fresh character.Overall I like itwith some caveats.  None of them are deal breakers and Ill continue to play but these things dont feel right. The amount of water and food consumption needs a tweak or the game time does.Especially early before you can get a settlement with real farming youre scrambling for food.  If you eat all the old worldnoncooked food youre left looking for Rad Away.I really like it needing to be a serious consideration but time to debuff and amount required to remove it are a bit short and high respectively.Some sort of tracking for your companion is needed.I had dogmeat run off to somewhere and need healing and could not find the dog to heal it.Ammo weights need a rebalance.RL bullets are heavy in the game so far Ive not been discouraged from carrying whatever I want.  Including all the leftover mm from when you grab the minigun.Admittedly Ive not made it very far but Ive managed to scrounge a few hundred roundsbetween mm mm . . and . and I can happily carry them around.CookingYou should be able to use purified water and what you cook should give you a better bonusresult for doing so.  Bottles.Things you fill with water should be reusable.  I assume this would require a new item type as right now filling containers converts them to the Purified Water or Dirty Water items.The save thing gets me.  I understand wanting to make it an interesting consideration but Im also constantly afraid of a random game crash.

And not for any kind of immersive reason for something thats got nothing to do with your character in game.Why is my character walking long distances to find a bed and sleep? Because I needed to do something IRL. Or I just felt like taking a break. Then I come back to the game and have to walk back to the location I walked away from before. I will probably not play the new mode if they leave the save system as is.

Did you know that the games heal you at a really slow rate automatically? He keeps track of that so he knows how much health he really has. Thats a true challenge. Survival mode is meant to be hard but a fun kind of hard. If it were really hard there wouldnt be so many antibiotics around or the ability to make purified water with empty bottles. I just think that there should be a sleeping bag that you can take anywhere. Immersive realistic and allows for saving anywhere without saving in combat.

7101337,0,t1_d1l5mj1,In addition to the story elements uTwfer mentioned there was a lot more variety in game mechanics too. Not all of it was anything spectacular but it did at least show a bit of creativity on the part of the developers. One quest was entirely going and taking pictures of landmarks. Another was getting an animal to follow you around by coaxing it with fruit while you led it down a mountain. You defused a bomb from blowing up a train. You could bring a dead soldier back to his grieving wife. You could interrogate a prisoner. OWB introduced stealth mini games and things like that. Lonesome Road would have enemies show up behind you an ambush you. Dead Money did a lot of things with environmental dangers and other nonNPC challenges even if they were a bit tedious. The Thorn was a pretty novel concept. You could get a tour through the Repconn museum and a minitour with the Boomers. That quest to isolate the virus in the BoS bunker was pretty interesting also kinda tedious but challenging. You could sacrifice your companions in a variety of ways lol. There were a few instances where youd rescue captured soldiers. The assassination or prevention of the President. You could disguise as any faction and in a lot of places there were ways to kill everybody covertly waste barrels above the Legion camp sabotage the Repconn rockets selfdestruct the BoS etcThen of course there are the branching quest trees skill checks which diversified character builds and story options and Im sure a slew of other stuff Im forgetting. Within this engine which is very limited in what you can actually make it do those were pretty good ideas to spice the game up and make it more than just a murder sim.

You could head into every fight head first without scouting the area for enemies without checking corners without getting behind cover without a worry in the world because if you failed well you could just reload your save from  feet away before you took the encounter. With bedsaving Bethesda forces you to consider the distance youve traveled and the progressloot you could potentially lose which will make you think twice about YOLOing into every fight.

7111783,0,t1_d1mhihq,I agree with you. Those are great games. But do I want to play the same games as  or  years ago is what im saying. Sometimes complicated features are great. I like EQ and DOAC more than current mmos because of that reason. But they dont have  sequels following them.Quest mechanics for example have changed alot in Bethesda games. Some of the quests in fallout  werent possible or done in previous installments.Lets face it though we all have nostalgia for old games. Im not trying to be defensive but the main point that I usually hear is that its not the same as the older versions and my answer is usually duh.

7114116,0,t3_4cy9jb,Started a new game to try the beta and now Im currently at level .  I must say the early game is a bitch to handle more so if youre new to learning the mechanics of Survival mode.  Ill admit that I initially was frustrated with survival because it seemed unbalanced and while I do think parts of the food water and illness still need tweaking I feel the rest of it is balanced to offer a stiff challenge to anyone willing to take it on.One thing Im really finding amazing is how much stuff Ive missed after clocking over  hours with my previous characters.  Thanks to no fast travel I have to trek my way to every destination and Ive already found about  unmarked locations and about  random encounters Ive never witnessed before.  Of course this could be done on any difficulty when you personally restrict your use of fast travel.  However knowing you cant fast travel and knowing you cant save unless you find a bed makes your journey that much more tense and memorable.Survival mode for me is a whole new experience forcing me to change how I play and how I interact with the world in ways I would have never really bothered with before.  I hope Bethesda tweaks the foodthirst and illness a bit because something about slamming  bottles of water to quench a thirsty status seems like overkill and the amount of food you have to eat to satiate a hungry status would likely leave you wanting a post overeating nap before charging back out into the wastelands.Lots of other really cool things Im noticing too but Ive spoken my peace.,Fallout,d1ms5wp,9,t5_2qnzu

7166714,0,t3_4dnnop,I definitely agree about the map  while I loved the location and all the different settlements I feel like the story took you on kind of an annoying grand tour of the map instead of pushing you to explore on your own. However this could also be looked at as a positive thing in a way because by the time you were a high enough level that you felt comfortable exploring blindly you already had a good amount of fast travel locations unlocked so you werent walking for miles to get to an area of the map that you hadnt been to. Both  and New Vegas had their own map problems though. Fallout s main questline barely touched the northern part of the map at all. It kind of felt like there was this weird division line where the best side quests were all in the northern part and all of the main quests were in the southern part. New Vegas s map had a LOT of dead zones with Crescent Canyon and Searchlight Airport being the worst offenders. I mean things like Ivanpah Dry Lake were dead as well but at least they were BETWEEN things  CC and SA were on the extreme edges of the map and were potentially really cool locations but did not reward you for exploring them AT ALL. That being said I just love the setting and the different factions of New Vegas. Playing as a nonspeech oriented character really made you consider who you made friends with since they all had their own sets of conflicting and wellblending ideals.

7195369,0,t3_4dzy2t,Nah.  Fallout  just has a different atmosphere and it all has to do by how hard it got hit.  Fallout  and  take place out west.  The west got hit less hard in the nuclear war because of the military industrial complex missile defense military bases and sites like Area .  East Coast got hit the hardest because thats where the enemy focused its attacks and defensive systems failed.  The vaults in the east opened later or havent opened at all yet.Seems like Boston got hit less hard than DC but is still pretty bad.Fallout  DC got pounded int Oblivion.  Lone Wanderer plays more of a savior.  The whole reason civilization and society is having a hard time building anything that lasts is that the water really sucks all over the place.In New Vegas  Las VegasMojave seem way more habitable than the East Coast.  This was due in part to the missile defense system.  Much of the ruins and such are the product of neglect time decay weather and human survivors fighting over the place.  The Courier is some sort of chosen one that is supposed to help decide the fate of this place.Fallout  Seems like the Lone Survivor is late to the party.  Its  years after the war.  The Lone Wanderers actions already set many things in motion on the East Coast.  The Lone Survivor spends early part of the game trying to catch up.  Clean water is more common.  It feels like hes missed a lot.    Hostile place extremely hostile but more habitable that the Capital Wasteland.,Fallout,d1w1yxo,7,t5_2qnzu

At this point the game franchise simply has too much design baggage to be salvageable for fans of earlier Fallouts.A new entry in the franchise is going to have to deal with spending time and resources on stuff like incorporating and expanding the new base buildingpet settler mechanics and voiced protagonist. Leaving these out would result in a tremendous backlash from the new fans from  that were drawn to these more casual elements of gameplay and genuinely enjoyed them.I dont see how you could write a game in the mold of New Vegas and earlier Fallouts and realistically jam in those newer mechanics without seriously compromising game play.,Fallout,d1z1ajf,0,t5_2qnzu

Seriously getting annoyed by this. Not really funrealistic to have to backtrack to a bed to save every single time I make a little bit of progress because Im terrified Ill get randomly oneshot by a wild dog or something before I find one. Conversely Ive also been in several situations where there are so many beds available to me within a given area that I feel like survival mode is effectively a nonissue.

7350901,0,t1_d2dp9h9,I dont think it would be possible with how Minecraft currently runs.The game operates on ticks which occur  times per second if Im not mistaken. This means that the fastest computer possible in Minecraft will only run at Hz.DOOMs recommended processor speed is MHz  million Hz or . million times the speed of Minecrafts fastest possible speed. Creating a computer like this requires the use of command blocks however. These blocks allow you to enter console commands that are triggered upon the block receiving a redstone signal. The downside to these is that they arent exactly very performancefriendly if a lot are used.A computer capable of running DOOM even at  of the normal speed would require an incredibly powerful PC much more powerful than any PC that can be built today.So while its technically possible to do such a thing in Minecraft it would be unimaginably slow and would require an unimaginably powerful PC.If youre interested in what can be done currently in Minecraft Sethbling makes amazing contraptions in Minecraft  vanilla.,Fallout,d2dqwth,6,t5_2qnzu

Small story game changing then new map.That said I would like at least  more cycles or just only story DLCs from now on.,Fallout,d2ee2oe,4,t5_2qnzu

7427664,0,t1_d2mglzt,Other reasons their world would be different than ours you mean? For one there are huge differences in geopolitical relations the most notorious being the fact that the USSR was not so much our enemy and China took their place. Resource shortages change the game quite a bit. Its evident in I think all of the games that we never went through the s period of trade liberalization where manufacturing and such was outsourced to other countries. That is still done here in the US although a lot of the time its done by robots. Apart from the raider punks I also mentioned the hippies. Both of those counterculture movements happened in two different decades in our world but its unclear when exactly they happened in Fallouts.By far the biggest proof and really there is no proof. My theory relies on the notion that the government destroyed any proof we could have found. is that there is absolutely nothing in the wasteland that would give you any indication that there was widespread civil rest going on to the point that weve been informed it was.

Not worth fussing with.Theres also a bed in a train car on the railway tracks a little south of Starlight DriveIn.There are multiple beds in Lexington though most will require you to clear a few raiders. The easiest is probably Lexington Apartments as theres only two leveled raiders and theyre both in one room. Just watch out for the landmine and the tripwire.Mystic Pines has multiple beds and no enemies whatsoever. Stop there every time you pass by.Once youve cleared College Square there are multiple beds including proper beds not just mattresses available for your use.There is a sleeping bag in Union Hope Cathedral. Watch out for the ghouls and uh Gabe.There is a bed inside the first room of Beantown Brewery. Just be aware theres a raider sleeping in it so youll have to shoot him in the head.Obviously when you unlock Hangmans Alley there are multiple beds there. If youre too cheap to rent a room theres also a unowned mattress intended for the use of the Diamond City guards on the south wall outside of the Great Green Jewel. Its a fine stopping point if youre off exploring but be aware you may wake up next to a burly man in umpire gear.And thats everything I can think of off the top of my head. There are a lot of other beds in the area but those are the ones I can remember that dont require a lot of work to access. If youre coming from Sanctuary theres a bed at Gorskis cabin and there are multiple beds around Walden Pond and inside the raider hideout and Rocky Narrows Park dont pet the yaogui. If you havent unlocked Abernathy farm theres an unowned bed outside it in an abandoned caravan. Theres also a bed out at Ranger Cabin.Consider picking up Aqua Girl uh or Aqua Boy dependent on the shape of your characters genitals.

Essentially when you look on your PIP Boy the food water and beds for your settlement will all be at  eventhough they are there. When you fast travel back to it the numbers are restored and everything is fine.  The counters themselves effect happiness anyway so you can actually lose settlements because of this glitch. The glitch itself begins when you fast travel away from your settlement. If you run to the outskirts and THEN fast travel you will never have this problem ever again.

7621586,0,t1_d38ixxt,The whole point of the Institute is that they are literally the brightest minds in the world. And not just a few of them but hundreds of them. In a facility completely isolated from war hunger disease radiation and any other distractions. Their entire purpose from their very creation was to simply sit underground and make cool shit for hundreds of years while they wait for the world to get back to normal.And in  years they couldnt accomplish what the Think Tank did in a few decades prewar and from what we know the Think Tank was dangerously incompetent on top of that.The most interesting thing besides Gen  synths that the Institute accomplished was the ability to keep a guy like Kellogg alive for over a hundred years with cybernetics. But they cancelled that program even though it clearly worked for...reasons.A lot of the institute tech just seems to be Bethesda going with the first excuse they can come up with to justify issues with their story.Shit how do we explain the plot hole of Kellogg still being alive... Oh how about the Institute made cyborg technology? Wait shit how do we explain the lack of other cyborgs? Oh I guess we can put a computer terminal in somewhere that says they shut the program down.Fuck how do we include Super Mutants in Boston? I mean we cant just leave out such an iconic enemy.Well why dont we just say the institute experimented with FEV? And they just happened to let loose an army of green monsters.From their underground facility that has no exit or entrance besides a teleporter? I dont know doesnt all of this seem like a bit of a copout?Shut up Dave this is perfect! Perfect I tell you!OP is right. A great deal of the institute just seems like an after thought.

This happened about the turn of the century and by WWI the major navies of the world had main battlefleets composed of entirely Dreadnoughtstyle Battleships.Those guns on the Texas are secondary weapons designed to fend of faster opponents whod close and attempt to launch torpedoes.

I agree it is a completely different game however they were made by two different entities and of those decided to take different routes from the success of the franchise prior to New Vegas.

I hate plagiarism when it hurts people but I always thought the modding community in general worked on a fairly free to use setup. Usually its a just ask to use my work and Ill almost certainly give you permission as a formality system.    So really the worst thing these people are doing is just not asking permission which is hardly endemic to just console ported mods. This kind of behaviour has been happening for years.

I will be more than happy if you point to some examples of quests that offer several ways of completion.  I will admit I have only put about  hours into the game and as such have not felt the need to buy Far Harbour so I could be missing out there.  I feel why youre upset.  I am too.  I really really wanted to love this game.  I scoured the internet several times a week from  looking for fragments of information on this game.  I suffered through various TheFuseJoplin articles that were mere clickbait.  I watched old interviews of Godd Howard hoping for something.  I adored Fallout  and I fell in Love with Fallout New Vegas.  This game for me is extremely disappointing.  The factions show no moral ambiguity.  My choices dont matter for the most part.  Ignoring whether the voiced protagonist is a pro or con the dialogue options as repeatedly pointed out are usually just Yesyes Sarcastic Yes No Yes Sean? See Yes.  The locations feel empty.  The locations have nothing there for the most part no terminal stories notes holotapes or unique enemies or quests.  I think they have focused a lot on what destiny has done with RNJeezus to keep the game fresh.  I can see a lot of the major disappointments I had with Destiny here.  I was expecting a story driven RPG and instead got an rpg lite sandbox shooter.  I watched Howard talk about keeping gamers playing.  A lot of what he talked about can be seen in Fallout .  Its a long video but if you are a fan of Bethesdas work or IPs it is worth a watch.  Seen I have elaborated my point would you care to elaborate yours?,Fallout,d3vjmu3,2,t5_2qnzu

7828485,0,t1_d3vzbvz,Yup if you read into the back story of Robobrains the first ones made were criminals or prisoners of war that would have their brains removed and reprogrammed. Robobrains were created before the Great War by General Atomics International both for the U.S. military and for the civilian sector. Official government records list only chimpanzee brains as being used in the robots but at least some human brains were taken from the bodies of executed criminals. Many of these criminals were insane so the resulting robobrains also tended to be unstable despite complete reprogramming via the CODE technology. Some of these humanrobobrains hybrids would try to kill themselves apparently resenting being made into cyborgs.Link to the wiki page  ,Fallout,d3vzlie,3,t5_2qnzu

7852761,1,t3_4msv5q,Im tired of this whole console players suck trope thats been getting trotted out in the Fallout subs lately. Look this kind of behavior is literally as old as the internet. Whether its Summer Reddit or if youre an old timer the dreaded September Floods theres always an uptick in borishness and assholery when a large community gets access they did not previously have. They are not all hopeless cases of severe retardation... theyre people and just like in real life that encompasses a lot of different personality types and demographics. Some of those people are children or teenagers who grew up on the internet and are emulating the shittalk and edgelording they saw the cool kids do. Some of them are people who didnt read the article or use the search function and ask the same question thats been asked and answered already. Most of them can be taught its just a matter of trying. A vanishingly small percentage of these people are insufferable cunts who get off on being douchebags to others they exist but in much smaller numbers than most of the people around here seem to think.Going with the motif of the Septembers of Yore people being dicks isnt the only familiar behavior were seeing! Weve got the doomsayers lamenting that these newcomers will destroy for everyone the very things they so enjoy. Weve got the class traitors newcomers piling on with the old folks about how horrible the new influx are so as to set themselves apart from the riffraff. And we have the Great Old Ones the people whove been around so long theyve forgotten that they were once the insufferable twats they now hate. While they posses a wealth of knowledge they wont share it without contempt and disdain.Im over it. This is what happens with newbs. You teach the ones that can be taught and ban the fuckholes. Its not happening right now but it will. This whole thing isnt two weeks old yet and all we have is endless goddamn kvetching about it another tradition as old as the internet true but one of its most annoying features. Bethesda will ban bad actors and the unteachable eventually. It may take a few months but they want to build a console modding community so theyre going to have to do it. The avalanche of dickish comments modmakers are currently enduring will slow to a trickle in the next few weeks. The number of modders who leave the community over it will be minimal especially in the face of the number it stands to gain. As will the number of mods ultimately unavailable to console players in the end sane console modders will work with sane PC modders on licensed ports of mods if the developer is unwilling to do it themselves. And a community will form because thats what happens in spite of all the trolling cocksuckers. So can we stop with the consolebashing please? ,Fallout,d3ypy66,1,t5_2qnzu

7866273,0,t3_4n14vy,The reasons for the differing weapon sets can be mostly explained by the laws and restrictions placed on private ownership of guns in different states across the United States in the years before the war. Places like Boston and Washington DC have gun laws that are more strict than places like Nevada. In Las Vegas private gun ownership was allowed which accounts for a wide variety of weapons purchased by civilians in addition to the military weapons that were in use. With many weapons to choose from for legal purchase you saw more nonmilitary caliber weapons and a greater variety of types than what was issued to peacekeeping troops.In Boston and DC there are already more strict gun laws which may have lead to confiscation before the bombs dropped. This leads to smaller numbers privately owned weapons. The mass produced weapons that are in the game are mostly what would have been used by the military with the combat rifle and shotgun light machine guns and mm pistols being the most common weapons issued to the troops that were enforcing martial law. The other weapons that are somewhat common are the bolt action hunting rifle and double barrel shotgun which were probably either not targeted by gun laws due to the nature of the weapons or were hidden from law enforcement by the owners.This also explains the reason for the appearance of so many pipe weapons in the game. Since civilians were not allowed to purchase weapons they would be forced to make their own. With the riots and looting that were happening in the period just before the bombs most people probably wanted something to protect their family with even if they did have to make it themselves. ,Fallout,d408pfn,20,t5_2qnzu

As long as you have the magazine perk where you harvest double the meat from animals youll end up getting two meat for every one meat you spend to repair the cages upon use. So for example lets say you have a few mole rat cages these require  radroach meat to repair for another rat. So you go out and kill radroachs killing two radroaches is  meat and using that  radroach meat nets you  molerat meat. So as long as you have the magazine you can basically use the cages as an infinite meat duplicator.You can also go a step further.. You can then use those  molerat meats on an insect cage possibly netting you  radroach meat or two meats of any of the other possible insect spawns stingwing bloatfly bloodbug. Then yknow its just a repeat of using whatever amount of radroach meat you get on the molerat cages netting you more rat meat for more bug meat.So no matter what you just end up with copious amounts of food. Just a matter of time but because of the time investment you are spending food for survival on those days so the only way to stockpile meat this way feasibly is to have enough veggies to live on while you farm away on your animal cages. Id only do this as sort of a save all my meat and just slowly duplicate it over time everytime I visit the base sort of thing for lategame farming.,Fallout,d4cjewb,3,t5_2qnzu

There was a small quest line attached where you had to clean it out and then treat the septic pool with lime you got from Quarry Junction.

8033506,0,t3_4p9008,Im going to wait for everything to be out before passing judgement but I get where youre coming from.My impression us that Bethesda is trying to add in more low level mechanics and functions in order to give mod creators more flexibility and more tools to work with. The biggest let down for me is that this workshop content wasnt included in the base game. That means that we now have redundant mods broken menus and a general feeling of what the hell we already have this. On top if that now mod creators are being forced to constantly cycle back to their finished content and revise it eating up time they could be using to make more awesome content.Imagine the kind of mods we would have already if all that workshop content had been available at release. Its clear they had a vision for opening up a lot of creative potential but right now it just feels like a wasted effort. The time constraints that restricted this games development become more and more obvious with each new workshop style dlc and its frustrating.,Fallout,d4j1it2,10,t5_2qnzu

All of which could shorten the length of the journey substantially. Also you misunderstand her timeline. She left the Capital Wasteland very shortly after the events of Broken Steel while Lyons was still in charge. She had no contact with them while on the West Coast and didnt even know about their deaths until she returned  after the events of New Vegas. Maxson would have just been instated as Elder a short time after her return. Further she wasnt lvl  when entering the Mojave. She was level  or so although I did have a mod which temporarily lowered some of her stats until entering Vegas or rather the New Vegas clinic for more advanced medical care  so as to help restore a balance to the early portion of NV. The reasoning behind the temporary stat decrease being that you just got shot twice in the head and didnt have much time for rehabilitation and physical therapy before you hit the road once more. To top it off I edited the mod to randomly cripple the head for a few moments and the restore it as a way of simulating headaches and confusion from brain trauma.,Fallout,d4o4bb3,1,t5_2qnzu

8090209,0,t3_4q0oyk,I dont think youd be able to hook any alternate start mods into FO due to how personal the story is and integrated your characters established backstory is to the main quest. Youd end up having to totally rework at least half of the main quest line and make tons of small alterations elsewise. Itd almost be better to just start from scratch and make a whole new main questline using the existing assets add in a bunch more settlements with their own unique sidequests to help smooth things over and provide more chances for RP than what the vanilla quests provide. Honestly Id like to play a Enclave remnant. Not necessarily an evil character that Bethesda tried to paint them to be but just as some poor bastard who actually believed in America and followed his orders. More like a middle ground character between Moreno and Cannibal and have them forge their own paths and alliances through the Commonwealth  still with the goal of pacifying the mutant threat and rebuilding infrastructure. A Mariposa Super Mutant build could be interesting too but would probably require far too much unique dialogue. East Coast Mutants arent developed past the point of being generic dumb ogres so theres no real precedent for them trying to get along with humans for it to make sense that everyone isnt freaking the fuck out when a green meanie comes stomping into their neighborhood... and its not like anybody on the East Coast could tell the difference or would let one get that close. Still being barred from locations like Diamond City and Good Neighbor initially would at least put a bit more incentive on building settlements since the only places you could call your own would be the places youve built for yourself  until youve helped enough people anyhow that word gets around that youre one of the good ones or a bad one thats not to be crossed but is at least reasonable  as the case may be,Fallout,d4pew3r,7,t5_2qnzu

8101563,0,t3_4q3rav,gt I forgot how bad the UI was in New Vegas given that it was designed for consoles and then ported over. Fallout  has similar problems but theyve been mitigated a lot better and so it isnt as annoying.Id disagree with this strongly. FO has the much more console oriented and frustrating to use on PC UI out of the two games. Theres a lot of mouse over contextual actions which are painfully obvious that they were intended for controllers. Targeting in VATS can get clusterfucky when trying to aim for specific sections of the body while the enemy is in motion  changing the part of the body which the mouse is hovering over  and thus changing your target. Similar problems exist when trying to edit character features. You hold RMB to turn the characters head and new head partslayers are selected by hovering the mouse over the option. Unfortunately this feature isnt shut off while holding RMB so while turning your characters head you can easily scroll over the available options and end up changing to options that you dont wish to view. Furthermore theres more than one than one area in which if you dont have a scroll wheel  the arrow keys are used. The realtime item looting menu for example. Even when in the full item transfer menu the up and down scroll arrows at the side of the item window are fiddly and hard to reliably navigate. You didnt have this problem in NVFO where you could just grab the slider and pull down. And while scroll wheels are fairly ubiquitous not everyone has one. Terminals similarly make heavy use of the arrow keys  and is more or less the preferred method of navigation since the entry selection is rather sticky  in that it doesnt highlight an entry that the mouse is hovering over  it only highlights an entry after the mouse has moved away from and reenters the text field. Any game which forces you to take your hands off of the mouse in order to use the arrow keys  is bad design. In FONV you didnt have this problem and did not require you to fiddle with the arrow keys even with the lack of a scroll wheel because the menus were designed to be navigated easily even if not optimally with a mouse pointer.,Fallout,d4qosyw,1,t5_2qnzu

8156176,0,t1_d4wifv3,i would agree with you if the entire building system was done completely different. maybe if it was a group of people that you assemble and then delegate to building and sourcing materials etc. stuff you could actually see happening in game that got you involved kinda like how in order to modify weapons you need to go to a bench and actually work on it rather than plonk a shed from outta the sky stuff that took time and progressed and then the gameworld actually acknowledged the building of your settlement word gets around people start talking about a new contender to Diamond City and Goodneighbour that sort of thing. Maybe. But tbh when I think I want to play construction or management games Fallout is not what I picture. couldnt thatve been achieved to a much better degree in Fallout Shelter?but the way i see it building isnt actually within the game world nothing changes no one cares about what you build. forgive me for saying this but its like the system tried to blend other games but failed. This does not feel like rebuilding society it doesnt even feel like rebuilding the Commonwealth theres no trying either you need wood you get wood you build planks planks built thats it. done. nothing more to do with what you built its there and thats it. no one cares.

8162426,0,t3_4qz25p,Ive always wanted an interesting hub city that doesnt run out of content in a few hours.  The same way Bethesda does random encounters Id have a long list of random settlement events.  And really this could be applied across all the major settlements and if youre really tightening the screws each city has its own unique list of random events.    Every time you arrive in a city once per day or a days time goes by in the city if youre staying there theres a small chance of a random event.  It then selects randomly duh from the random events list.  It could be anything from a minor NPC moving to another settlement.  An escort quest at the main gate.  A bar fight.  A marriage.  A divorce.  A baby being born.  A new building is built.  A building needs repairs.  A trial by jury with a hanging or banishment if you convict.  An election.  A disease outbreak.  A siege outside the walls.  A mysterious stranger arrives with a story.  You get it.  Just shit that happens in a city.  That way every playthrough every city would be different and you probably wont even see all the random events in one normallength playthrough.  One of my biggest complaints about recent Fallout games is they make these enormous dynamic worlds but and this goes for Fallout  specifically these major hub cities and even smaller settlements become these static boring areas after not much playtime.  With a random events list the cities and settlements would keep giving new stuff to experience hundreds and hundreds of hours into a play through.  And the world would feel that much more alive.,Fallout,d4xuniq,1,t5_2qnzu

Automatron has some quests and robot building which is very useful.Thats all assuming retail prices of course.  The season pass has been available on sale through third party sites got mine from GMG for  off and that clinches it if you plan to buy both large story DLC anyway since youd be paying less.The season pass gets a lot of hate but any objective analysis would tell you its a good deal unless you dont want to buy the two major DLC but if that is the case you wouldnt be in the market for the season pass to begin with.This analysis is timesensitive though.

But my point standsThe majority of users dont run into the two bugs that you mentioned because most people stick to one POV or the other they dont often switch between POV. Additionally not many would care about such minuscule issues when there are bigger bugs to be fixed. Thirdly adding more voice acting really doesnt take away from bug fixing as the majority of the work with voice acting is recording it its barely any work for the programmers to add a few names to Codsworths list and associate the appropriate sound files with those name entries.In short youre complaining about fringe bugs that are probably rooted deep in the engine requiring a lot of work to fix them for little benefit as they are neither game breaking nor a problem that most people would come acrosscare about.edit sDodsworthsCodsworths,Fallout,d51fns3,3,t5_2qnzu

8291346,0,t1_d5dfrvu,I dont like that comment and Im usually a fan of xkcd.  Brute force attacks can usually get short passwords but require exponentially more time for longer passwords more characters to try. So while correcthorsebatterystaple might withstand a brute force attack the more common attacks are using rainbow tables. Rainbow tables are large text files Ive seen a gb one Im sure there are larger ones that contain lots of potential passwords and their hashes hashes being the encrypted version of the password. When someone uses a rainbow table to get your password they get the hash from the server and compare it to the rainbow table and then simply read your password off of it. This gets more complicated with salting adding extra known characters to the password which changes the hash but can be adjusted in the rainbow table. The passwords that are susceptible are mostly words or combinations and their variations  instead of e. Betterlarger rainbow tables have more variations and combinations.  So in short longer isnt necessarily better due to the techniques hackers use. While the comic may be correct for one method of hacking its a  year old comic. So much has changed in this time and the comic shouldnt be taken as fact. No password will be safe forever the best way you can ensure safe passwords is choosing long obscure passwords and frequently changing them.,Fallout,d5dz6pv,1,t5_2qnzu

Maybe have her give you a minor boost in Charisma when shes around Or when you try to do a check and fail maybe theres a chance she would interject her thoughts essentially giving you another shot at the speech check?This is the way to salvage characters like Piper from a gameplay standpoint. Not everyone should be a combat powerhouse a character like Danse and Strong should be worth a dozen Pipers in a straight up fight. But that doesnt mean the less combat capable character should have no mechanical contributions.Anyone else here played Dragon Age ? It introduced calling on companions to the dialogue system. Whenever a companion had relevant perspective knowledge or skills you could deffer to them in dialogue and have them solve issues. It was most notable with Varric the born storyteller.People were upset that the game removed the persuade options from dialogue but players who brought Varric around soon coined a new term. Varric is my persuade option. Calling on Varric to unload a dumpster truck worth of bullshit and confuse the hell out of people was always priceless.If they gave us the option to call on less combat focused characters in a similar way it would make them a unique gameplay asset for more combat focused player builds. Have shit persuade skills? Bring Piper and have her pass speech checks for you. This way characters can fill different niches and we avoid every person slowly building their PC towards the same thing increasing build diversity.,Fallout,d5kekfp,6,t5_2qnzu

Ive asked someone about the lucky armor before and its benefits. Apparently it helps in VATS with accuracy.

Its best played in the context of a full playthrough rather than waiting until you finish up.Far Harbor adds a new area that you travel to.

8434498,0,t3_4uxf9e,Lol I would love to watch you try and play Survival Mode in Fallout . Fallout  when it first came out lacked any difficulty. Thats why Survival Mode got redone and became something that was so much better. Fallout  and New Vegas had a learning curve where you get pretty much wrecked the first few levels and as you gain experience and perks you start to fare better in the wasteland. It made sense. The more experience you had the better off you do. Fallout  on normal lets you be a tank right from the getgo. I usually play all games the first time on Normal difficulty because thats the way it is supposedly supposed to be played. It was just way to easy so I had to buff it up to Very Hard similar to NormalHard mode from Fallout  and New Vegas but still pretty easy. Fallout games arent really difficult to begin with. Then Survival Mode came around and made everything so much better. I feel like I can never let my guard down on Survival. Hiding from enemies trying to figure out the best tactic to get out of this battle alive weighing the option of running away because saving via a bed was almost an hour ago. It puts weight in your options and how you play the game. It is much more challenging and in my opinion much more rewarding. ,Fallout,d5vuo6n,1,t5_2qnzu

8454239,0,t3_4v94wu,I would say that  is about right. I think when you start this game the world is out to get you you can have a mosquito bite suck up  of your health and rads tick way too fast. But if you pace yourself learn explore and work through the side quests while doing the main quests after a while a few dozen levels you start to figure out the world your place in it and get invested in the many characters and stories. You also work with and for companions changing their lives while they change yours. All of this builds you up in many ways aside from RPG stats. Instead of walking through the wasteland timid and jumpy you walk through confident and ready to deal with whatever comes your way. Its a euphoric feeling. I have read so many user reviews on Steam and reddit where they plow quickly through the campaign say it was too short try building and say it sucks then download each DLC only to rant how bad they are and how Bethesda is such a bad company.

If they win the Dam theyll have several years to fortify their position and equip and train their troops. The tunnelers wont suddenly appear with an army. Theyll appear slowly first only rumors then growing bigger. This gives the NCR even more time to respond.Mr. House on the other hand... I dont think hed win.

Its not fair to accuse them of being lazy or the DLC unfinished because turrets are not playerbuildable.If you want to actually do something give Bethesda feedback directly through their channels.  They released new stores and other stuff people have asked for so if there is enough demand they might do it.  Truth is if you treat them like this I dont see why they would bother.,Fallout,d69jkj3,16,t5_2qnzu

8562039,0,t3_4x232b,I remember trying to save Kent Connolly in this part. I didnt have the Charisma for the speech check so I saved the game and set up an elaborate plan to kill everyone before they killed Kent. I used a Stealth Boy and went into sneak with the . magnum that had a freezing effect aptly named Captain Cold on crit. I used that to freeze Sinjin and pulled out my two shot . magnum appropriately named Dirty Harry and used that to kill all of the henchmen while Sinjin lay frozen on the ground. Once I headshot each one of them I am out of AP so I take out my combat shotgun and run over to Sinjin who is now unfreezing and beginning to stand up. I take a hit of jet and blow the bastard down before he could get up. I felt like a super violent superhero that just did the impossible even though it only worked on about the th try.

8606690,0,t3_4xpk9t,I feel like this topic has been discussed many times around here to the point that such threads are actually kind of useless there are those who dont like FO those who prefer FO to earlier games and those who just dont care. I doubt that another topic like this will do much but hey.To start I compare Fallout  to a meal that has been hyped and advertised as the new best food you could ever eat. When the chef actually served you the meal however you realize that theres no main serving just some burned french fries on the side with tasty sauce.To elaborate Fallout  has many gameplay gimmicks that are entertaining and fun. The combat is a huge improvement from  and NV. Modding weaponry is fantastic. Power Armor makes you feel like a walking tank as you should be. The fact that you can build your own house or settlement is nice too.but it fails in just about everything else that makes it a Fallout game. Not even one of their most advertised optional features the settlements works properly. The story is disgustingly boring full of plot holes and meaningless interactions. Characters only exist to serve and help the main protagonist save for a few cases. Many companions are bland a mocking of what you can find in New Vegas. Every location is a shooting gallery with missed potential left and right. Factions are a joke. There is nothing that makes you feel like you accomplished something that makes you care for the characters youve helped not even a small amount of ending slides to explain what happens to the lives you touched. Zero. I dont mind innovations actually I welcome them. But I find that Fallout  ends up being a stale and boring experience once youre done shooting yet another raidersupermutantsynthwhatever. Give New Vegas a coat of paint with new textures maybe an ENB add some mods to improve on combat and locations you get a wonderful fallout that aged well with a story that can grip you actually many stories that can grip you and a game that can entertain for days weeks even.Fallout  cant compare to that.,Fallout,d6hfjak,1,t5_2qnzu

8615131,0,t1_d6if6kz,gt Assuming thats allowed. You often cant squat on names for things like that. It doesnt work out well for domains.Depends. There are many historical examples of registering domains of famous trademarks where the company that owns the mark paid a lot of money to get the domain. The TV show The League actually made fun of this when one of the characters managed to register dallascowboys.com for his cowboy singing service and eventually sold it back to the Cowboys owner. Similar reallife things have happened many times over the years. gt Anything Fallout could conceivably be handed over to the IP owner.Again that depends on a lot of things  one of which is the country where it was registered. Note that this mark was registered in Europe. Many countries have whats called a firsttofile trademark system where the trademark is granted to the first person to file for the mark. What youre referring to Anything Fallout could conceivably be handed over to the IP owner. is how it works in the US  thats called a usebased trademark system where marks are given based on priority of usage of the mark.Firsttofile trademark countries are ripe for squatting abuse.

Theyre the most powerful Mages and could easily crush the other houses if they wanted to but theyre all more interested in their own esoteric research.gtCorpus amp Blight both of these diseases are implied to be huge problems in Morrowind and both are actually on the verge of being wiped out but theres no story arc about curing either or even researching a cure.Both are actively being spread solely by Dagoth Ur. Once hes gone the force sustaining them just... stops.,Fallout,d6qgqh7,1,t5_2qnzu

8690295,0,t3_4yzbnb,The authoritarian military regime Caeser has built is pretty abhorrent slavery misogyny and executing anyone they deem to be a degenerate doesnt seem like a very good basis for a society. that leads into the question to whether Caesar can apply synthesis in his lifetime or if it will fall apart after his death maybe hes created a beast that simply cant be changed. You can argue relative morality with the Legion and the Roman empire however if history is any indication then sacrificing the rights of the people in favour of security doesnt usually end too well. Their aversion to technology is slightly worrying too Rome was built by technological progressiveness not Luddites. Also on a side note imagine if the Roman Empire had the technology that existed in Fallout? I believe that the scale of the atrocities they would commit would probably overshadow anything the Nazis achieved.That said the Legion are probably my favourite faction in the Fallout games they just seem like the kind of faction to arise from the civil strife of the apocalypse so I hope to see them in future games. I think it would be best for the canon if House pushes back the NCR and the Legion I dont think he will achieve the plans he hopes for but it would be great to have another major player in the wasteland.  ,Fallout,d6rwy82,5,t5_2qnzu

Found a workaround after about  hours of digging through variables and console commands. The fix is PC only though sorry.  PS users might have to wait for an official fix or for mods coming to PS.Make sure to save before messing with console commands. The fix that worked for me Go to the workshop in the settlement that cant be retaken. Open the console and click on the workshop to select it. Input or copy cf RemoveKeyword WorkshopType without the quotation marks into the console and press enter. This should turn it into a nonraider settlement again with correct symbol in the pipboy. It still cant be activated at this point. Now enter SetStage DLCMQCleanup  into the console to complete the Cleaning House quest.

8821322,0,t1_d7855h1,Nora actually has a much better story and voice actor in my opinion. Keep in mind this is entirely my opinion and based largely on the importance and resonance of the tag line war never changes and how that viewpoint restricts the character of Nick.Nick already had his war and it was the one that plunged the world into chaos and destruction creating the wasteland. He knows that war never changes and sees it as force for destruction and elimination which is a very defeatist view for the general of the Minutemen to take Im assuming that were focusing on a character whose primary goal after finding Shaun is rebuilding the Commonwealth.Fallout  is the story of Noras war. Shes learned from her husbands suffering and the failure of the Great War and can fight to rebuild rather than to defeat an enemy. She may destroy the institute maybe even other factions but she doesnt view that with purpose or pride its a necessary and regrettable action to create a safe and prosperous Commonwealth. Because she wasnt inundated with the ideals of the Great War shes able to guide a war based on the progression and wellbeing of the people rather than fear and hatred of the enemy.This isnt to say that you cant role play Nick or Nora however you like just based on their backgrounds and the tone of Nicks intro monologue I feel these arguments are worth considering.,Fallout,d7879yw,-2,t5_2qnzu

But as soon as metal combat or any other harder armor comes into play it gets very difficult especially for untrained archers to kill a enemy with one arrow a notfatal first strike would make the wholesilentaspect pointless.

I ended up enjoying the game but I really REALLY want them to move on now. Its the same basic engine since Morrowind its simply archaic at this point.

That said Gen s could probably volunteer for soldier duty if thats where their cognitive development led them. Coursers would also be similar to special forces.Edit Not to mention the new facilities closer to Toronto probably wont have the tech right off the bat for rd Gen production. They may start off with stnd Gen production to both train the new scientists and supplement the expansion effort.

But you cant tell me a person who is primarily PC gamer that also has a PS for some multiplayer games that pushing one button on the PS remote isnt better for getting to a point where you can pick a game. Youd have to be fanboy delusional if you cant cede that point. Theres no contest. Theres always some deviation on the PC that requires something different.

I really liked some of Playstations exclusives and I had read that the hardware is just a shade better but my friends all play xbox and I like to play with them so I got the One instead.I have tried out the mods for FO and while fun they are kind of a pain in the ass. I have a modded save file where I can just go around and be an unstoppable killing machine with crazy weapons and ridiculous  settlements but it loses its shine pretty fast. Especially when someone removes one of their mods from the store and it messes up my save file. I noticed I would have more crashes and issues in general when running them and it just wasnt really for me.My main issue is the one I already stated companies with zealously loyal fanbases are shitting on their users. Sony Apple Samsung Microsoft... and nobody can do anything about it. People get all riled up and stamp their feet for a week or so and then decide theyll just deal with things like not having headphone jacks or having highly invasive optional updates forced upon them.

Even if they didnt put it on consoles which are probably easier since all PSs have the same exact specs all XBs have the same specs theyd be limited by the hardware. PCs make it harder since the level of hardware you run it on can vary so widely unlike consoles.On PC some people run a minimum specd machine I run a medium specd machine and someone else may run a high specd machine. They have to try to make the games capable on a wide range of hardware.

9046063,0,t3_5455n7,Agreed.  I havent read much about vaults in particular but they do feel strangely underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in  and New Vegas.  I doubt anyone but upper level Bethesda employees knows for certain but it certainly feels like they cut a lot of content.  I can think of two likely reasons for cuts.  The first would be for time which seems odd considering Bethesdas penchant for announcing their games like  months ahead of release.  That could be explained by higher ups at ZeniMax applying deadline pressure I guess. The second is purely budgetary the brand is recognizable now so management no longer thinks spending resources on x questfeatureasset will net a sufficient increase in sales to justify the expense.  Putting extra work into pleasing hardcore fans who will probably buy the gameseason pass anyway doesnt have an obvious short term benefit so might as well not right?I hope Im wrong but personally the second possibility feels more likely to me given the trend toward broad appeal in recent entries.  Im not shitting on the game I like  and play it a lot despite my many personal criticisms of it.  ,Fallout,d7z6xg2,2,t5_2qnzu

9056052,0,t3_54a4c2,Yeah. Bethesdas worldbuilding pretty much appears to come from the perspective that were only a couple of decades removed from the war instead of a couple hundred years. With Fallout  and Fallout  both pretty much if you just imagine the game taking place maybe  years after the bombs the game world makes all kinds of sense it wouldnt otherwise. Its more than just trash too plenty of characters and even some quests make zero sense at  years removed but could be justifiable if its only a few years out. But yeah. The best sort of inlore explanation for it is that people grow up in this level of trash and decay and just basically dont view it as trashdecay to begin with. But even then there should have been more varying up theres nothing that breaks immersion about people wanting to keep their places tidy. ,Fallout,d80e55p,17,t5_2qnzu

Yes you could look at Shady Sands which has  houses by the way not  and say that it doesnt make sense but thats missing the point. The designers placed crop fields a cattle range for brahim and agricultural tools in that area to inform you about how Shady Sands manages to survive.The Brotherhood of Steel bunker is a large multilevel underground facility with access to advanced technology. The aforementioned caravan trading side quest establishes that they barter with The Hub for food and other supplies.And I didnt actually use Necropolis as an example. You also seem to have overlooked Adytum which I did cite as an example. gtI mean eh? Fallout  looked a LOT more like a postapocalyptic world than Fallout  did with its massive casinos porn star plotlines and weird other episodes. I thoroughly disagree about Fallout  being teeming with N.P.Cs.But Fallout  is also guilty of having areas that are supposed to be towns but only have half a dozen houses on a map. Why the double standard? By the way Fallout  has multiple casinos both in Junktown and the Hub. And Fallout  even reuses the same art assets of Fallout  because of the short development time so you cant claim that Fallout s buildings are more ruined. Theyre not.It is true that Fallout  has a zanier tone than Fallout  but that has nothing to do with how developed civilization is.

9148093,0,t1_d8aaejs,All the great Fallout games have always had Villains that werent entirely wrong.Fallout  The Master wants to transform humanity into a singular and resilient race. Free from differences that had plague them before humanity would become whole and the old humanity would simply die out. Peace would be achieved. Only hickup was the FEV II virus was sterilizing the mutants.Fallout  The Enclave believes and sees itself as the last bastion of true humanity. Unmutated by the airborne FEV strain DNA undamaged by radiation no genetic defects no birth defects and technologically superior they saw what humanity had become as not human anymore and sought to purge the wastelands of all mutated life before reestablishing America as it was meant to be.In many other settings the Enclave despite their methodology would be considered the good guys. A last bastion of what we are today against a world of mutants is a theme explore often in science fiction and post apocalypse settings. Only difference is that you in this instance are the mutant.Fallout Tactics AI is severed and malfunctions attempting to cleanse the wastelands of all hostilities. All resulting from its creators building it on the cheap. Arguably not the deepest Fallout but one where you can understand the simplistic action response that brought this about and the greed that lead to that.Fallout New Vegas The Legion does horrible things to preserve humanity and make it strong. In Legion lands there are things outlawed but there are no raiders people are safe and conditions are likely drastically more pleasant than they are on the front lines.Id argue NCR is just as evil of the two though as despite the Legions outward brutality the NCR is as corrupt and horrific to its citizenry. Most live in poverty a good percentage of the people are slaves but arent called slaves. The Rich run the nation and over tax the poor all while failing to provide the same security that the Legion does.Then you have Bethesdas games which are objectively bad.Fallout  Enclave returns copies story elements from  and  waste GECK on purifier fight over who gets to turn it on. Enclave merely wants to restore America Eden wants to continue the plan from  despite the fact that now the Enclave are just as mutated and would die from the release of the virus.Fallout  Institute makes bio robots and proceeds to give them capacities beyond what they need to fullfill their functions. They leave out AI laws logic filters fail safes and definitions as a means to maintain control over them. Outside people see simulated emotions and assume theyre real people and conflict. Also ripping off Big Mount without any of the payoff. Plus Super Mutant army because super mutants had to be in this game.,Fallout,d8bl5mr,1,t5_2qnzu
9152097,0,t1_d8c0i4n,Yeah this. I think theres some limitation in the engine too.

Just take a look at the NCR. gtNuclear war isnt just a minor hiccup it would likely take a thousand years for civilization to really start rolling again. You do realize radiation rates deplete rapidly after the initial blasts right? Within the first  years most of that radiation would have dissipated anyway. The rest of the radiation would seep into soil and rain. Some areas in the real world Chernobyl can be visited for several hours at a time without suffering from major health effects.Most of your points are based on the inconsistent and unrealistic way Bethesda writes the games. They purposefully write shitty events as an excuse to stick to their dystopian setting. Also there is no way Fallout  would be still be that uninhabitable after  years.,Fallout,d8d48fp,1,t5_2qnzu

A simple animation of a robotic mug with good voice acting dubbed over can easily be more engaging than any possible human character in the engine.Obsidian also used this workaround for the engine to great effect in the main game too Houses imperiousness the subtle affectation you can feel behind Victors friendliness and  Yes Mans unctuousness all work perfectly without having to gaze at an Uncanny Valley emotionless face.I wonder how much was actually intentional versus just welltrained instinct andor budget limitations but it works wonderfully regardless.,Fallout,d8hr4gy,224,t5_2qnzu

The G.E.C.K gets stolen and the storyline consists of you trying to find who stole it where its gone and obviously getting it back.The Architects Maybe this is more of a story for the creative minded player where the main plot is trying to rebuild the world youre in to make it a much better world for people to live in.Finally I absolutely love the MoonSpace idea.

NV was Obsidian and was really just a Fallout . same engine mechanics etc. so in a lot of ways I think people have this really set mindset about what a modern fallout game is... but its kind of too early for that kind of assessment. I think people should have a little more patience and allow Bethesda explore exactly what makes for a good fallout game instead of throwing around words like unacceptable and inappropriate when the gaming ecosystem is changing literally every week.I think fallout  did a lot to keep the franchise fresh and interesting. The environments lore and theming that has always made Fallout great is really flushed out in Fo. They added a lot to the story as well as unique enemies and I think the franchise is a lot more rich after the additions of . The combat mechanics are vastly improved and work well both in vats and out. Perks themselves not talking about skills have been overhauled and for the better in my opinion. The chart is a much better way to visualize your build and I like being able to choose from anything on the list given your SPECIAL stats are high enough. Lastly while the dialogue system I think we all agree has taken a hit... NPC interactions I think have been improved. Were no longer stuck in a floating head style interaction with every NPC but we have a more organic and cinematic discussion. I think this could have been merged with a more traditional style of dialogue nonvoiced pretty smoothly and I hope they go that route in the future.As far as if those improvements sacrificed on core elements? I think thats up to the individual player to decide for themselves. To me what is the core of fallout is the world and the lore. I think if theres one thing Fallout  did well its that. Now to other players the core elements or rather core mechanics are the RPG elements. Skill checks big dialogue trees and choice of whether you can be good evil etc. A lot of this did take a hit in  I wont argue with that... and a lot of it was in service to the voiced protagonist. All I can say is given that Howard has already admitted this worked less well that in the next games it will hopefully come back the other way. I do think however that people are a bit too harsh in this regard with Fallout . I actually had a lot of fun role playing in  and was super impressed both by the character creator and the aesthetic changes you can make to your character in terms of person appearance clothing armour etc. Fallout  and especially NV had pretty bad character creators even by their own days standards. I had a pretty hard time ever making something that looked decent to the point where I just wore masks because I didnt really care. Now I know what a lot of people will say which is RP isnt about appearance but about choice... well Id say its about both. Choice is great but only if you feel connected with your character... which I never really did in  or NV because my character always looked like a wood elf who sniffed some bad cheese. Would I like if  let you be more evil? Yes. However I have to say that the proposition that  offers about choice is perhaps more meaningful than  or NV ever did in that I felt the decision between the institute brotherhood or railroad held a lot more weight than  or NV. I genuinely struggled with that choice more than anything in  or NV. Sure in those you can be a dick and capture slaves and side with the legion etc. But in the end... that stuff never really meant to me since my character and even the relationships with NPCs never held much weight. All this is personal though... which is kind of my entire point. What works for some might not work for others and all we can do is voice what we like and dont like knowing that others may disagree. Hopefully the devs will adjust and find a happy medium in future titles to try to make everyone happy... but I hope you and everyone realizes how impossible that is. For the franchise base to grow you need to make is accessible. To make it accessible you need to sometimes make tweaks. Tweaks will sometimes piss off the hardcore audience who you dont want to alienate. Finding the right balance is damn near impossible. You dont want to stagnate you want to grow the franchise audience you want to satisfy the longtime fans all of these will conflicting goals and targets. Through all this you want to create a compelling story in a rich world. Personally I think all  modern fallout games have been miraculous and am grateful for them even to exist. I kind of think like Louis CK in this regard Everything is amazing and nobody is happy.,Fallout,d8yq98n,1,t5_2qnzu

9615160,0,t1_d9y8zj4,The environment design of Fallout  and NV was intended for the relatively slow place of combat compared to Fallout . Remember there was no run button in the previous two fallout games. ,Fallout,d9y9lhs,-1,t5_2qnzu
9615423,0,t3_5coeb9,Eh. Note I honestly didnt like FO that much and it always liked to crash on me so this will be based almost entirely on FNVPersonally I much prefer most elements of NV. Really the only things about FO that I like are the gunplaycombat AI behavior and the graphics which really arent even that great tbh and the game runs horribly for how they look. Id rather have the more realistic gun handlingperformance of FNV Seriously Bethesda have you ever actually seen a gun in person? First battle rifles arent chambered in . ACP thats a pistol round and secondly why does nothing do any actual damage? I shouldnt have to unload two magazines into one raider thats idiotic. but the AI in FNV is pretty atrocious so if we could have the FO combat AI that actually knows how cover works it would be appreciated.I have very little interest in settlements it was cool for like four hours and then I decided Id stick to Minecraft for my building. Then I got really annoyed at how integrated the settlements are into the actual game even if I didnt want them at all.I hate the dialogue in FO and everything about it KILL IT WITH FIRE. No voiced protagonist no stupid Xbox controller dialogue wheel no oneword descriptions no ultralinear conversations no randomized skill checks no painfully shallow writing NO.Really wasnt a fan of the companion system either. There werent enough of them they were immortal and they werent that interesting with the exception of Valentine. That isnt very relevant to a FONV port though as long as they dont implement the silly system where Veronica would get turned on by me punching people or something. Especially when Im a dude. I hated the EVERYONE IS BISEXUAL! crap too it really just killed any real feeling of being part of the world and knowing these characters as people.The biggest thing for me would have to be skillsperks though. Skills are important. They need to be there. They need to come back. The lack of skills and traditional cool perks and replacement of skillsold perks with a crappy generic boring perk tree based purely on SPECIAL and level was depressing and took so much replayability out of the game. Not that FO had much anyway with its lack of quest variety.The graphics  vanilla NV is pretty atrocious Ill admit. But modded its not that bad and if you have a decent enough PC to run  at all you can run a heavily modded NV that looks as good or better albeit in an entirely different way. Honestly I think the graphics are personal preference   is alright but its far from great and it runs horribly for how it looks. Really Id rather have something that looks and runs like Skyrim original Skyrim just because it can be modded into something almost photorealistic and still run better than vanilla FO. Since after playing New Vegas heavily modded for some time one can easily adjust and even enjoy how it looks Im honestly going to give it to New Vegas if only because good looking NV gives me twice the framerate that vanilla FO gives me and neither look all that great. Im willing to bet that the ridiculously bad performance of FO is thanks to the massive worldspace with almost no load screen doors but honestly I dont agree with that design choice for this very reason and I wish theyd done their world design in the traditional way. Im cool with second loading screens when I open a door if it means the difference between  fps and  fps.So yeah. Id really like the more stable engine though how much more stable it is than  bit Skyrim I still havent decided it likes to crash far more than Skyrim ever did and Id love the new combat AI and if they could figure out how to optimize graphics Id love better graphics but ehhhh I can do without basically every other change and I dont trust them enough to make a nice faithful remake without adding extra crap. So Id say probably no at least right now. Lets see how Fallout  goes if they make one and I may reevaluate then. Id say FO was overall a failure of a game and I hope they go back to the drawing board in the future and make me want to actually buy their next title.It wont happen anyway but I felt like writing a long response.,Fallout,d9yarhi,-1,t5_2qnzu

Anarchy House and Legion are just options that are too wild for the overall narative I think.  For fallout  I would have to toss between minutemen and railroad. Simply because those two options leave enough room to produce future naratives on. The railroad cant reproduce and the minutemen are too small to become a large player in the overall fallout world. The institute would simply be too dominant with their technology. The Brotherhood would spread its influence after such an campaign in Boston so I think for the overall narative it works better as a smaller group rather than a new nation of sorts such as the NCR. ,Fallout,dacpzkg,2,t5_2qnzu

9735537,0,t3_5ek3k1,Maxons Brotherhood is my favorite thus far because not only is it tough enough to survive in this dog eat dog world but it is still an organization that ultimately does a lot of good.    Maxons Brotherhood is a mix between the NV chapters and s chapter.  Fallout NV BOS Only really gives a shit about themselves and their religion. Will openly attack anyone who possess technology they deem too advanced. Outsiders are looked upon with extreme distrust and are very rarely integrated into their community.  With an ever expanding list of enemies and shortening list of allies the Brotherhood is pushed to the brink of extinction.  Fallout  BOS Will risk life and limb to protect the meek will do whatever it takes to bring peace to this lawless land. Openly accepts initiates from the wasteland to join their community as long as they uphold the Brotherhood way of life. The Brotherhoods original goals of the acquisition and segregation of advanced technologies from those that might abuse them has been put on the back burner for the sake of protecting the local populace from Super Mutants.  By casting aside their old ways the Brotherhood has split in two Outcasts and Lyons Pride. Whats worse is that the massive cost of waging a war against the Raiders Mutants and Enclave for the sake of the Capital Wasteland inhabitants has put an immense strain on the Brotherhood pushing it to the breaking point.  Fallout  BOS After learning the mistakes of Lyons Maxon has unified the Outcasts and returned the Brotherhood to its old values. Putting its priority on preventing the various atrocities that the old worlds unregulated use of technology has wrought the FEV Project Safehouse bioengineered plagues the nuclear holocaust etc.  Unlike the west coast however Maxon has seen how sensible enlisting locals to help can be while never stretching his forces too thin like Lyons did with his DC crusades. Maxon uses his might to wipe out small camps of mutants and raiders until they discover the massive technologically abusive threat of the Institute. Worse case scenario the Synths outnumber and overpower humanity Terminator style. Best case scenario the Institute maintains total control of the Commonwealth and continue to kidnap people for sick experiments and discarding old dangerous Super MutantSynth experiments into the wasteland openly knowing that they will kill innocents.  Either way they must go to war. Not because they relish the kill all synth and mutants and everything else attitude you describe them with but because the Brotherhood was formed in order to prevent this sort of abuse of technology. It could literally mean the end of mankind if it is left unchecked and no one else is going to do it.  The only real bad thing that Maxons Brotherhood does is that they do not considered manufactured AIs to be sentient life. Beyond that they are the greatest implementation of the Brotherhood we have ever seen in the franchise by not only upholding their factions important ideals but having the manpower to enforce them. These are no longer raiders with fancy armor and weapons. These are soldiers who will lay down their life if it meant protecting innocent civilians.,Fallout,dad48c4,12,t5_2qnzu

Not because of completition though but because I dont stand them anymore.But in New Vegas I always uninstall before doing the last quest. I think it is because when I complete the main quest it will effectively mean Im done with the game and Im not sure I want it to be over. I still have two more DLCs to play through so I still have something to look forward to in my next playthrough.By the way if you dont like Skyrim Im not so sure you will like Fallout .

9794582,0,t3_5fczb3,I might be a massive outlier here but I dont think Fallout s modding system was good. I dot even think it was an improvement on New Vegas modding system in some aspects. In New Vegas you got a gun you liked the gun you wish the gun could kill people better. a few levels go by and your gun starts under preforming. You are sad you stop using gun. Suddenly you find a merchant that happens to have a mod for your gun that makes it better than viable and can even change the way you play with the weapon you have your favorite weapon back! But you dont have enough caps for it mods are an expensive commodity in the post apocalyptic world. You have to sell some useful stuff as a trade off or collect some bounties to earn your new weapon upgrade you EARN your improved weapon it comes with a sense of accomplishment and achievement and nothing beats the excitement of finding a weapon mod you were looking for for ages in New Vegas.Contrast this with the mod crafting system in Fallout . Sure its a neat idea in a brainstorming session in Bethesda Softworks What if we let players find components out in the wasteland that they can use to make mods?! but I dont feel that it translates into anything but an annoying time wasting grindesque game mechanic. It turns the game into a Pick random shit up and horde it Simulator. Ive always had trouble in Bethesda games with inventory management and adding the fact that I now have to actually pick up all this random shit from all over the place just makes it even more annoying. And thats another point. This shit is EVERYWHERE. You can pop down to the nearest landfill and find the same components necessary to build either a long barrel for a mm or a goddanm MIRV launcher for a Fat Man. There is no challenge in finding the stuff needed to make weapon mods other than the fact that you can never get enough adhesive but that doesnt add challenge it just adds frustration and annoyance. Whats more if youre in a pinch its only a matter of fast travelling to  or  different merchants to find all the junk you need to create whatever mod for whatever gun you want. And the junk costs about as much as a four day old dog turd in a can. There is no CHALLENGE present in the Fallout  modding system. I have never had a feeling of Yeah Ive worked hard for this mod and its really changed my gun for the better when playing Fallout . Only feelings of frustration that I dont have enough metal spoons to give my . Magnum a better handgrip to give its stats a . boost to accuracy. Thats another thing the potential mods are so saturated that upgrading in the normal progression doesnt feel like youve done anything because the stat boosts have to be balanced between all the potential mods. When I put a better receiver on my gun in New Vegas I got a decent stat boost  or  it was noticeable. In  I get a  tops its only noticeable if youre upgrading at a high level and by then youve managed to horde so much random shit that crafting is about as difficult as hitting water after you fall out of a boat. Which brings me onto my final point.The level gating. In my last two playthroughs Ive managed to collect the sum total of about  tonnes of scrap while waiting to level up enough to unlock the last teir of Gun Nut and Science! I had all my weapon mods maxed out for about  or  levels I had spare perk points the only thing stopping me from upgrading my weapons more was the goddanm level gate on the perks. So I saved junk to use when I finally got there. By the time I leveled up enough I had enough junk in my trunk to fully upgrade every single weapon in my inventory in one go. How did I feel afterward? After all that time spent I finally had all my guns fully upgraded. I felt empty I felt bored I felt like all that time spent looking for components was completely wasted. Oh my gun is a new colour now the mag is slightly bigger than before and it does  more damage... yay... I didnt feel like I had earned those weapon upgrades. They all went on as soon as I got to level whateverthefuckitis. This coupled with the complete lack of weapon variety in  made me lose all interest in the game I was bored of the weapons. In conclusion I think Bethesda should have gone with a less is more approach to weapon mods making them more impactful and useful in the game as well as more rare and valuable. The acutal mechanics of weapon modding are cool Ill admit that and a LOT more streamlined and polished than New Veagas but its let down by so many other aspects of the game the level gating the lack of weapon variety the over saturation of weapon mods. It was good a step in a possible right direction but it is my opinion that it needs a LOT of work to be fun and enjoyable. Hate me shout at me call me a fanboy. This is my opinion if you dont like it too bad. Im in the same boat as you I bought Fallout  under false pretenses too I find it difficult to be this damming of a game Ive put countless hours and  into but I have to be honest with myself. These are not rose tinted glasses I played another game of New Vegas after  and I enjoyed  it so much more. If youve read this far congrats Ill buy you a muffin.,Fallout,dake76l,4,t5_2qnzu

They say they want to help the Commonwealth and destroy the Institute. Thats good. Oh but wait they hate synths. And ghouls. Both synths and ghouls can be friendly so that isnt good. Throughout the questline both of these problems come up and you deal with them as you see fit.  See what I mean? The BoS have both good and bad qualities. The only bad quality of the Minutemen as you stated was their leadership is shit. You are the leadership. Throughout the entire course of the Minutemen questline there are no people challenging your leadership. Noone betrays the Gunners. You dont lose your center of communication and shit hits the fan. Nope its just go save settlements! Now! X needs help with Y!!

Theres ruined and halfintact power armor all over the place in the Commonwealth. They probably just found a few suits and transported them to a garage. Also does every single group in the game seriously need a indepth backstory? The Atom Cats are literally greasers who fix up power armor instead of cars.Sure realistically theres power armour all over the place for  years. That totally wasnt just so Beth could parade their new power armour system or anything. Only the SS and the Atom Cats enjoy using the big poweful tanks lying around everywhere. s. Realistically if power armour needs no training then whats stopping someone from hopping into one of the  halfintact power armor suits in the  year gap thats before the SS wakes up to do it himherself?Taking that into account a bit of lore as to how the Atom Cats know how to mod and fix power armour would be nice. Those suits run on nuclear power and unless you live in Silicon Valleys upper class area or some shit nuclear physics arent common knowledge. Weld the wrong thing and kaplooey.

9940854,0,t1_db39gl8,Really? Because a very simple way for consequences for Caesars death to be shown is to script some much more aggressive Legion patrols maybe even situations where the Legion completely overwhelms and captures NCR outposts and tortures the occupants. Thats doable with the GECK. Its a massive oversight for something like that to have not been in the game. I also think its a oversight for the Argonians not to be living in Wndhelms docks but that can still be explained by them simply forgetting to put in dialogue expaining why they are still not allowed in Windhelm so thats a minor issue.

9941364,0,t3_5hsx99,I was introduced to the Fallout series when a youtuber was making a walk through of fallout  when it first came out and I fell in love with it so I got it and had a blast.. so fallout  was my first fallout loved everything about it besides the combat since it was a bit wonkly but still loved it. When fallout new vegas came out it was more of a meh but with BETTER combat I know its in the desert area but good lord it felt dead and slow.. and I was highly disappointed that you cant continue with the game after you beat the main quest... I did  notice though it was made by obsidian entertainment and I did some research to find out that they or at least  some of them were former interplay employees that made fallout   and tactics.. which made me try thoes out  sense of humor for fallout  and  but looking for what to do next was a pain... and easily got lost all the time but introduced me more about the Fallout universe and how new vegas relates to  and . Fallout Tactics I loved everything about it didnt really have any negatives besides I wish it had a longer story and gave me more insight about the brotherhood of steel. Than fallout ... my all time favorite game so far after playing the pervious fallouts this became my favorite franchise I knew all little tricks and secrets to get everything and how to swindle people in the games to receive both rewards when possible which usually means backstabbing others to reap more rewards but back to fallout  when the game was announced I couldnt handle myself... I tried to get the pipboy edition but couldnt due to it being sold out... and later on just couldnt afford it due to misfortunes but I was able to pre order the game yes I know pre ordering is bad but I had to do it.... and even though it has a ton of valid flaws.. Its my favorite game by far... I spent more hours into that game than any other game I played.. and my only reason for defending this game with my heart is because no other game could beat the experience it will give you or at least for me that is. This postapocalyptic era with sish theme with open world rpg elements made this my favorite game... I have the game on xbox so I cant run it to its full potential  and my potato laptop cant run it so Im still missing out on a lot.. hopefully some day I can afford a pc and the game I can run it with mods and enjoy it even more. But back to the topic every game has a story and takes you to a new world to experience what its like and fallout sold it to me the best.Im on mobile so forgive me for any bad grammer.,Fallout,db3dugz,1,t5_2qnzu

I played  hours before I did the main story missions and only became bored with the game once I finished them I ended up platinuming it too.  Moral of my rant? Stop the main missions at Mass Fusion and youll keep all the factions and wont get frustrated by the shortest ending a fallout title has had yet.  Aside from that the settlement building has won me over and prbly accounts for most my play time other than exploring and looting  pieces of junk picked up .

Sure theres a few vocal negative folks who shit on Bethesda no matter what.  A few.  But the overwhelming preponderance of people who criticize parts of Fallout  are more than ready to say theres a lot about the game they do like and theres an overwhelming amount of people who loved  who totally recognize its not perfect and could use some sprucing up.  I think the real story here is that people are compelled to call for peace when there isnt even really a war happening.

The thing is though its not a very good RPG compared to the previous Fallout game thats the thing. Like the most dialogue checks Fo had was just dice rolls which determined if you got  more caps or if youd get information earlier that you were going to get later on anyway by using normal dialogue options. Its laughable compared to the various skill checks in NV which was present in almost every quest and conversation. Meanwhile in Fo the SARCASTIC option trues to squeeze its way into every conversation...And not to mention it is far easier to become a jack of all trades in Fo than NV in regards to weapons and its even worse that Fo gives you the big toys like power armor so early on that just ruins the pacing of getting cool equipment IMO. ,Fallout,dbajftu,4,t5_2qnzu

10065017,0,t3_5jwg2v,. I generally suggest playing Fallout  first before moving on to New Vegas. This is because FO was released first while FNV was released two years later. FNVs gameplay is heavily based on FOs gameplay but with lots of refinements such as iron sights and improved sniping expanded crafting better companion interface etc. Therefore if you play FNV first and then move on to FO a lot of features will be missing and itll feel like a step backwards in many ways. . I suggest no mods for your first playthrough. This gives you a baseline experience to compare future modded playthroughs with and also gives you an idea of what kind of changes you want in your game since everyone prefers different things in their modded game.  . I would suggest picking a combat skill and sticking with it.  For your first playthrough you should probably focus on Small Guns for FO and Guns for FNV since most of the weapons you encounter will be Small GunsGuns.  A weapon with a high corresponding skill level will outperform weapons that would intuitively do more damage. For example if you have a high Small Guns skill and low Big Guns skill in FO then an assault rifle will do more damage than a missile launcher.  Furthermore in FNV after you complete the tutorial town of Goodsprings the game will strongly suggest you head south and I strongly suggest you follow this suggestion. Heading north will lead to you tangling with Deathclaws and Cazadors neither of which you want to meet at low levels.  . FO and FNV are similar to the TES games in that the main storyline only accounts for a small fraction of the game. The bulk of the game comes from exploring the open world doing side quests and uncovering the hidden unwritten stories that are waiting to be found in the wasteland. So basically dont focus only on following the primary storyline instead take your time to explore and enjoy what the game offers.  Of course there will be slight differences in that youre using guns instead of swords and youre fighting mutants and robots instead of draugr and dragons but generally speaking the worldbuilding philosophy is similar so the transition shouldnt be too jarring. ,Fallout,dbjhtym,10,t5_2qnzu

With Beantown it feels more removed from the game more obviously a mod and too refined. Again though that might be because the overall feel of FO is more lived in than FO.,Fallout,dbnjukq,2,t5_2qnzu

10144280,0,t1_dbtr7vm,I agree with you  there. Its kind of a shame because of just how good they are at environment design that theyre really poor with enemy placement. Even from a believably point of view I do not think there would be a raider camp right beside a super mutant camp and just down the street from a major settlement and then seeing that pattern repeated over and over is just... unfortunate. Really most of the enemies feel like gun fodder with absolutely no reason to be there in the first place. But the play space underneath all that is so fantastically well designed its really a waste. But Im still looking forward to the next game and see what paper thin excuse there is to bring supermutants and BOS back. ,Fallout,dbtsxsg,13,t5_2qnzu

10164993,0,t1_dbw8n8b,The caps are pretty good quality and you could sell batches of about  for  bucks easily. The pipboy featured there probably isnt of a high enough quality standard for selling. Pipboys are particular for fans of the games including myself because we want it to be as close to the real thing as possible. For example I have built a one of a kind pipboy for myself off a Fallout  collectors edition mold I goty hands on and it has entirely working internals and partial button functionality. It boots up and works just like a real one from the game. USB cable hook up for data and charging and one of a kind upholstered interior for my arm. At conventions and prop events Ive been offered over a  dollars for it to build one like it anyway but it cost me about  to make easy and labor is intensive. So my point is if you offer a product like that with a sizeable chunk of investment in it you can get a huge sum of profits from fans who are willing to pay the money for its worth.

It had mostly been for aesthetics because I love doing drills in my militarized settlements. But that time when that siren went off and all those guns suddenly powered up at once it was one of the most wonderful things Ive ever seen in this game. It felt more badass than setting off a nuke.

They keep synths as slaves this only counts if you believe synths are people.Theyre cartoonishly evil.

10560126,0,t1_dd4nuky,gtThe burden of proof belongs to you. There is no proof to show that in Fallout  that VaultTec didnt have ulterior motives. There is no proof whatsoever in Fallout that Vaults were experiments. Unless I missed something while playing the game that is pretty much a fact.The Fallout Bible was written by a guy that didnt even work in the first game.gtThere is evidence however that proves that for all intents and purposes that VaultTec has always been meant to have them. No you are implying that yourself. It is canon that Fallouts Vaults were experiments but back in  judging from what was in the game there was no proof whatsoever that said this is meant to be this way. Between two possibilities we thought everything from the start including the Enclave and so on and we designed just a game Im sticking with the latter. Particularly since again the Fallout Bible was written by someone who only worked in Fallout  and not Fallout.gtNo information of the sort exists in Fallout  to prove that VaultTec was purposefully making shoddy vaults.I didnt say they were purposefully making shoddy vaults only that they sucked at making them and it shows three out of three Vaults in that game   Necropolis failed in different ways.

10571025,0,t3_5rcvjg,I think so. But for me I try not to judge games by contemporary standards. Like Navarro said it came out in  itd be silly to judge NV by the standard of  unless youre explicitly judging it by how its held up. But New Vegas is a fantastic RPG and I love the dialogue. It surpasses Fallout  in writing but it fails to meet Fallout s seemingly big feeling world. So as far as exploration goes NV can leave something to be desired. But I still think New Vegas is a fantastic chapter of the Fallout franchise.,Fallout,dd6bgtb,82,t5_2qnzu
10572768,0,t3_5rboy5,Yes in my opinion it should. NV are objectively better in a few aspects but Fallout  still focused deeply on crafting a world that was fun to explore rich with quirky characters and choices that affect the world. Things I shouldnt have to worry about not appearing in a Fallout game Fallout . Its main weakness is the main story which is honestly just a reimagining of the stories in both the first games. Despite this the game was still fun and I enjoyed the way they implemented statistical RPGJRPG gameplay numbers in an open world game. I also felt that it was the right way to modernize the franchise without becoming too detatches from the RPG mechanics I expect from the series. In fact both  and NV showed me that Fallout can arguably benefit more from being a D open world franchise. Fallout  on the otherhand was  a step in the wrong direction and most of the things it did away with were things that Fallout  managed to get right.The first two games and NV are the pinnacle of Fallout at its absolute best. Fallout  is in between good and kinda almost great. Thats just my opinion though others might disagree and thats there right. I personally just want a Fallout game that turns VATS into an actual turn based combat system and a prompt that asks you if you want to play fallout as an FPS or a third person turn based RPG before starting a new game. Also they need to bring back actual skill points and force you to stick with a build till the very end of each playthrough.,Fallout,dd6hy74,7,t5_2qnzu

One thing that is great about  compared to  is that i could possibly choose to be an evil character if i wanted to be. Blow the up the town and murder sheriff and become a slaver. Tons of more dialogue choices. You could play through most of game and not fire a shot whereas i dont think you can on fallout But it had like  it own share of problems like the gunplay and not being able aim down sights which i think were fixed with mods.I think give it time and some of fallout  problems might be fixed by mods but that will take time. ,Fallout,dd6s7jf,1,t5_2qnzu

Hoover Dam is really the only source of water and it had freaky deaky F.E.V stuff going on in the basement which mightve been more pronounced early on to prevent looters.California probably because of more equal population distribution compared to Nevada had a lot more Vaults.

Could have been able to join them and do lots of quests for them or go to war with them for another faction.  Nope.  Nothing but shootonsight endless fodder.    Multiple Raider gangs with named leaders all over the map.  Any interactions?  Nope.  Shootonsight endless fodder with just a few terminals describing their travails.  But nothing actually in the game to make any of it seem rich or real.    Triggermen a cool s gangsterthemed org could have been running drug prostitution and gambling dens with quests and perhaps at odds with other bad guy factions.  What happens?  Endless shootonsight fodder.  Super mutants opportunity to instill more organization and give them some kind of real aim or foil in the Commonwealth.  What happens?  Endless fodder.    Feral Ghouls Coulda had some cabal of regular Ghouls controlling an army of ferals for their own aims.  Thats just one dumb suggestion.  Coulda done anything to make them more interesting.  Nope.  Endless fodder.  Hell coulda had Piratey Raiders at Libertalia and have it be a town you can visit and quest with.  Nope.  Just another shootnloot camp.  Well all know the millions of more examples about locations towns and factions being left in the rear view mirror during the development cycle.  Bethesda has environmental art and level design like no other.  Their worlds look and feel amazing.  But when it comes to writing in engaging content and Im just at a loss here they fall on their faces.  Im amazed at the talent gap between their art designers and their writers.  Hopefully they hired some pros on for the next IP.  Bethesdas writing is amateur hour and it shows.  Their world building is like open mic night down at the local pub.  And every act gets up on stage and goes wouldnt it be wicked cool if  ?!  And then everything that was said at the open mic night actually became the world in the game.  Its pretty clear they dont have real writers on staff.  Or at least writers who understand the point to open world RPG video games.  Theres a sad dearth of cohesion complexity intertwining purpose and motivation narrative arcs to anything but the main plot etc. in their games.  They sell their amazing environmental artists and level designers short.  Weve been saying it since release everything was in place to make Fallout  such a rich wellbuilt deep world and they instead erred on the side of Far Crystyle shooter camps and settlement building with a tired uninspired retread main plot with incredibly predictable twists.

10710384,0,t1_ddkf9jt,The story is good its just not the right story for this game. As a parent finding your kid would be your number one priority. If they were going to do this story justice the game would basically be in on rails for the first half.Thats not how Bethesda does fallout games though nor is it how Obsidian does it. The original Interplay team did that with fallout  but not since. So because they dont put you on rails and dont want you to feel pressured to do anything they dont really do the story justice. You dont really feel like the SS really cares and you dont really get the emotional impact that the reveal at the end of the chase should give you.The idea of the story is good but they didnt commit to it and so they end up with something that feels kind of cheesy. Its kind of the problem of a lot of recent Bethesda games and to a certain extent Obsidians titles and a lot of others as well. You cant really have an open world sandbox game with a hugely compelling story because a story like that makes you want to finish it and thats not what sandbox games are supposed to be like.Edit added missing words fixed spelling,Fallout,ddkp1z5,12,t5_2qnzu

Id love to see a thunderdome you could compete in. And have the raiders be more flavorful that grrrr lets killem.Hell I can think of some interesting things. Raiders could make quips according to what you had. Like if you had a nice gun they could shout Im gonna take that pretty rifle of yours!

Note for example the Gutsy robots who demand you return to your home citing it irrelevant that the War was over  years ago because martial law dictates a mandatory curfew.. Theres always been loose indicators in the series and a few major ones of AI breaking free of its circular logic and becoming self aware. Most notably the ZAX in Fallout Eden and MARGoT in  although calling Margot selfaware is a sketchy definition and so on.

Their glaring flaws are part of them it fits with the games theme of history repeating itself.Also to clear it up the explaination behind the slave army is these soldiers have nowhere else to go. Their tribal identity is gone they cant rebel because they have no allies. One can run away sure. But they cant grab like  guys and try to hopelessly fight off the entire legion. They can either fight and live with their new identity or run off most likely in hostile territory.Also they are also made to be the more evil choice but all Im arguing is theyre better explained than stereotypical Were evil because its fun factions.,Fallout,de1p5pi,20,t5_2qnzu

The Sorrows are still totally cool with you if you spare SaltUponWounds but you have still killed a large amount of the White Legs populace that was fit to fight but killing this one dude emotionally cripples them being a little hyperbolic there but you get the idea.

Yeah its absolutely frustrating when you lose a long period of gameplay to something stupid but I liked how survival encourages you to not just go guns blazing but to scout out an area chip away and if it seems overwhelming regroup and come back later with different equipment or companions or whatever. I think it also adds a nice sense of progression when a set of enemies that was really difficult becomes easier to defeat. Bruteforcing your way through with saves kind of takes away from that a little in my opinion it was an issue I had with Skyrim as well.

11123131,0,t1_desjq0f,gt With that line of thinking then we could justify raiders raiding settlements are not bad because they would starveExcept Raiders arent currently preoccupied with killing threats to humanity. Also Raiders dont offer to pay for the stuff.gt Heres themselves saying that they will go hungryThat is an issue of Raiders. And I guarantee that they will not actually starve. They are still alive any time you visit and the Brotherhood isnt dumb enough to force their food source to die.gt Thats a lie. Its never mentioned in Fallout . The only games where its mentioned that they do trade is in the early Fallouts in the West Coast. The East Coast they dont do trade for whatever reason.First off I seem to recall the Brotherhood mentioning trading in both  and . Matter of fact you can even see Brotherhood soldiers and scribes trading in Diamond City. Second off if the west coast Brotherhood traded with people and as I said the east coast does as well Maxson would definitely do it as well. The man mixes the best parts of the east and west Brotherhood. Something both sides agreed on is sure to keep going.gt Check New Vegas endings the brotherhood part . Spoilers obviously.. Anyone who has technology they arbitrarily decide they shouldnt they will take it. That someone wont have the choice to refuse just like raiders dont give them a choice.They believe technology nearly wiped out humanity and they are RIGHT about it. There is nothing wrong about keeping dangerous technology out of the hands of those who would use it to do bad things. Plus they trade other types of technology to people in the wastes Pretty sure thats been said in every single Fallout game.gtTheres a character in Underworld a settlement full of nonferal ghouls that says the Brotherhood has a habit of shooting them on sight. And this is during the good Elders rule Elder Owyn Lyons not Maxson which loves the original Brotherhood ideology.If the Brotherhood had a problem with normal ghouls you wouldnt see the LARGE amount you do in Fallout . I mean if the Brotherhood actually killed normal ghouls Goodneighbor and The Slog wouldve been immediately wiped out.gt A human can be brainwashed similar to reprogramming.Its not the same and it requires large amounts of time. To make things worse the Synths are stronger and faster than humans are and dont require sleep.gt Under certain conditions the brotherhood will become hostile to the minutemen. Then you receive this questIn all of my playthroughs the Brotherhood has done nothing to the Minutemen. The only reason the Brotherhood has to attack the Minutemen is if the Minutemen attacks them. The only thing that triggers that quest is being against the Brotherhood.gt Yeah I guess wiping out an entire base full of people that only crime is helping robots is a good thing. My bad.Their crime is helping out a potential threat to humanity.

Theres no need to run power anywhere at all and if you clean the room up theres enough room in that room for the terminal and whichever device youre testing easily.When you get to actually yknow building the vault remember that vault pieces include conduit automatically so if youre building off the spur of hallway that leads back to the reactor room your vault walls already have power running through them and you need only apply the little vault conduit panel to one then wire it to the devices you need powered.Personally I let my ers live in the big square cave room and just add a vault reactor in the middle of the chamber. Theres little need to build an actual vault rooms etc since theres more than enough open space to put in factories living space and job opportunities in the cave. Its not like the virtual people care. Ive checked. They only wanted more soda and for the guy on the Scentmaster  to pedal harder.,Fallout,dfcnlq8,1,t5_2qnzu

11313746,0,t1_dfe6i61,I have a problem with destroying the institute though... FO could have been way more better... originally you could challenge Maxson and take his spot as Elder... they shouldve gave you more options and whatnot... what I would have done as Elder is order my troops in power armor with modified tranquilizers and sleep grenades to come in and secure the facility. I will Execute Father... that man... we may share the same blood but hes dead to me....I will also do what the U.S. Government did to Evil Nazi Scientists.... get their Data in exchange for sparing their life. I  will also locate and secure all vaults in the commonwealth. The Vaults would be used as secret Underground HQs as well as barracks. Depending on how they are built I would have them construct tunnels to have them connected.In the event of an uprising I can quickly mobilize my troops to move underground and suppress any resistance..  I will have the BoS conquer land one settlement at a time while securing tech.  birds with one stone. I  would also secure that Saugus Iron Works. doing so will enable me to create Power Armorweaponstoolsetc more efficiently. All Synth Production will stop. Ill have it that any future Synths created will have a fail safe put in place the moment they act up.. I will implement synth technology to upgrade Assaultrons to make them deadlier.I would recruit outsiders.. especially children... even more so if they are orphans.. give them a better shot of life so they dont experience something similar to what Cait has gone through. These kids will be trained to be Elite SpartansStormTroopers to break the line so troops can move in on the battlefield. The MinuteMen will be Internal Police to handle Domestic Affairs The Railroad will be my eyes and ears on the ground within to population to let me know whats going on... basically Fallout s version of The NSA...  I will have my Scribes cooperate with Institute Scientists to rebuild the C.I.T Ruins into a schoolUniversity of sorts. WasteLandersCommonwealth Citizens are free to come and go as they please. All Abandoned PreWar Hospitalsetc will be rebuilt to help the local population and those who are passing through.... I will have Propaganda Speakers installed on the Prydwen and Vertibird informing Raiders that they no longer have to live the way they do anymore.. all past crimes will be pardoned if they join us for they will have a better life and will no longer have to kill to survive.. if they refuse then death of course. I will organize Massive Clean Up Crews to clear RubbishDebreeRadioactive Materials and rebuild houses. Etc.. As BoS Elder I WILL restore order and civility to the commonwealth.

North East America has that.  aka the pitts.aka BoS are more likely to build a ship sail all around south america and get ot hawaii.  long before the NCR do.that should explain how bad production is in south west america theres a reason we have trains move metal across the US so that we can build in ports on west coast.  cause the refinery is on east coast.hell  if we look at FO.   the BoS are more likely to take the prydwin across the pacific to Hawaii   than anyone is to build a ship.and even that is suicide.  but its at least more possible seeing as how BoS has actually managed to build it better than Germany and Britains Zepplin programs.the best shot anyone has of building an ocean going ship is a prewar one that is repaired.   which becomes more difficult each day due to water erosion  time and the lack of fossil fuel.  most prewar boats dont exactly use nuclear power.  This is why i recommended the Enclave.  they focus on airpower.  something BoS is only now experimenting with on east coast.the Enclave if they actually set up in anchorage   has not only the means to produce and refine metal.    they have the raw natural resources to run some of the older tech aka oil gas etcand this also lets them avoid those sea monsterstldr NCR and BoS both gonna be stuck on land for a while. they have neither the need or want to go over seas.while Enclave being possibly based in anchorage alaska.  have the means and want to.  due to the military base in hawaii. and the battleship port,Fallout,dfkdnxd,1,t5_2qnzu

11510928,0,t1_dg0qckg,Considering that most of Diamond City ousted the ghoul population running on an antighoul platform is how McDonough was elected that would have required a very bloody conflict. Bigotry doesnt go away. Even helping synths with the Railroad is a clandestine effort and synths die in the MM ending precisely because of how many in the Commonwealth feel.PostVic Goodneighbor is very much a response to the antighoul sentiment that permeares throughout Diamond City and most of the Commonwealth. Its really the only place where ghouls can safely live alongside nonghouls in the vanilla game. Thats a fairly significant accomplish on Hancocks part.I get what youre saying but Id imagine very few folks are openminded about ghouls and the Railroads focus means that they have very few members in comparison to the Brotherhood for example. All the factions have members who have issues with ghouls. Creating a new settlement focused on that with a proghoul faction would likely lead to less bloodshed.,Fallout,dg0rka5,1,t5_2qnzu

11567550,0,t1_dg5q2q6,Using aquaboy as an example theres also the issue of not all perks being created equal. You get one perk to spend you can either increase your damage by  or reduce the annoyance of a particular obstacle. Of course you go for  more damage. Too many of the perks were Id like this but I need that.Id handle it by having multiple perk trees and different questsactivities give you perk points in relevant trees. So using Fallout  as an example youd have a Minutemen tree where doing minutemen quests and unlocking settlements gives you perks in it. The perks in that one are minor because you get a lot of them. Use the flare gun twice a day? More artillery? Better equipped minutemen? These are fun things that wouldnt be worth a perk point in a normal tree but certainly worth it if you want to do Minutemen stuff.How about a survivalist tree? The talents for making wildlife not attack you getting wildlife to help you getting more meat from animals... or the perk that was superpathetic on its own Rad resistance. Get perks in that by accomplishing feats of survival like killing  deathclaws being exposed to a rad source over  radsecond etc.That way your main perks can be those boring damage booster ones and you get a steady stream of fun perks to use. ,Fallout,dg76r1b,1,t5_2qnzu
11567649,0,t3_653fp0,Remember that Boston had a very heavy military presence leading up to the bombs dropping. There were constant checkpoints random searches and no doubt numerous arrests. Theres a few terminals that evidence the treatment citizens received and a lot of it wasnt pleasant. Remember also at this time there were food and energy shortages. In the big city where youre dependent on groups you cant control or influence to supply your food and power then youre shit out of luck if theres a shortage.So with that in mind I think the reasons are twofold. First a number of people would have been detained by the military predominantly AsianAmericans and many more would have left for somewhere with less military presence as it would have impeded their daily lives beyond and acceptable limit.Secondly I imagine a number of people would have left to less populated areas where they could potentially subsist so as to not be so crippled by food shortages. You cant grow a vege patch in a downtown apartment. These people would have moved to the country or smaller satellite towns.This leaves behind two types of people Those who are wealthy or secure enough to stay and not be affected by shortages and by extension rising prices. This would be the games protagonist couple since they have a combination of a military pension and a lawyer. Those who are too poor to leave and had probably turned to a life of crime shortly before the bombs fell so as to keep food on the table since they wouldnt have been able to afford it.Funnily enough this could also explain why the Commonwealth is so overrun by raiders. If the majority of people left in the Boston area when the bombs fell were poor uneducated and increasingly violent and crimeprone then that would have been the legacy of ruthlessness passed down through generations to make the bloodyminded raider factions we have today.,Fallout,dg775l1,47,t5_2qnzu

In NV there are multiple gambling games hookers a fighting pit to gamble at things to pass the time to make it feel like youre living there a bit more. Little activities to partake in that the other NPCs  in the world partake in.  One of Bethesdas biggest flaws in world building is making it so that nothing would really happen without you around its like all the NPCs are just standing around waiting for you to arrive so they can live their NPC life.

There are only three major settlements Diamond City Goodneighbor Bunker Hill inhabited Minutemen settlements Sanctuary Abernathy Farm Tenines Bluff Graygarden Robots Covenant County Crossing Finch Farm Northhagen Beach Oberland Station Egret Tours Marina one hermit Somerville Place Warwick Homesteadand one permanent trading post in the form of Drumlin Diner.Besides that there are only the three faction bases to trade at and the roaming traders.The three major settlements honestly feel kinda dull but thats not the focus. The main focus should be on the minor settlements.Most of these settlements can at most be called hamletsfarmsteads with only Covenant and maybe the Slog deserving the name of a small village.
