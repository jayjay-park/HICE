3349926,0,t1_cp9vtbk,Im  and my creatinine is similar to yours. My nephrologist tells me it will likely be years before we have to talk about dialysis or getting on a transplant list. Ive been a bit of a partier my whole life and there are certain situations where I still would be but have to be super careful. Thats more due to my diabetes than to the kidneys though. The kidneys make me crazy solely due to the swelling. I get edema like crazy and cant wear skirts or shorts hardly ever. Makes me sad.Im really glad you and your wife are able to support each other. It truly helps. My SO has been wonderful and hes really the only person I talk to about anything. It can get lonely but talking about having  kidney function with anyone else freaks them out.,kidneydisease,cpa47dy,2,t5_2wkhb
