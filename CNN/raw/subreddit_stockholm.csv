Seems like you cant throw a stone without hitting a bus there are a couple of trams and some commuter trains. The subway runs from  in the morning to  in the evening h service on the weekends. Rush hour has between  and  minute between trains in the inner city  minutes on offpeak hours and then  minutes on the really really weird times like in the middle of the night. When the subway isnt in service night busus take its place. If you only go two stops each day a monthly card looks expensive.

9625869,0,t3_5cpe6z,I would guess a few things.Highly educated people who are comparatively cheap. Because Sweden is a quite good country to live in people dont feel the need to leave as soon as they get an eduction. This means that its actually relatively compared to especially the US cheap to hire highly educated people.Lots of old money. This generates VC.Old successes with Ericsson ABB SAAB Volvo etc. created an engineering tradition that carries over generations.Lifestyle that fits modern city dwellers. This is related to the first point since it encourages people to stay. Productivity of labor here is high and I like to argue that this is because people have a lot of free time to recover so you dont have offices full of insomniac zombies. Tight safety net makes risk taking cheaper on a personal level. Related to first point again.I would also argue that you really have to carefully define recent years. StockholmSweden was completely crazy during the dotcom boom and crash. The dotcom boom might have a relatively strong correlation with the current tech era. The telecom deregulation happened at a perfect time during the early growth years of the internet the government agency overseeing the telecom deregulation didnt suffer from regulatory capture so lots of strong competition grew making internet plentiful and cheap. The people running the internet in Sweden were thinking and doing the right things and many of them are still involved at high levels in internet governance. ,stockholm,d9zl4q4,5,t5_2r7aq

9960479,0,t3_5i6vaw,Welcome! . I think your normal one will do fine. I get by every winter in a similar outfit although some days will be chilly. Ive frozen more in NYC or London than in Stockholm. The cold is different here less damp and the buildings are often better isolated.. Outside the city? Id try to visit the archipelago if youre into art theres a great gallery just outside the city called Artipelag. Taking a ferry out to Fjderholmarna can be cosy but id do it in spring. A walk around Djurgrden is nice. To be honest most of the stuff worth doing is quite close to the city or in the city.. Avoid eating out which is overall pretty expensive. Cook your own meals and bring a lunch box to school.. Drop Coffee at Mariatorget is pretty neat!. Im pretty sure thats illegal to carry around.... Dont worry. Swedes are generally very polite and very modest. I think Stockholm suffers a lot from NYCcomplex and are very fond of american city culture. Trump not being one of those things for sure.. Yes i would even bet you can get by your whole stay without learning one word of swedish  I would skip the class unless you love learning new languages. Most swedes will prefer talking english with you in either case because it will be easier and less awkward for all involved.. It can be very hard and expensive to find someplace to live in Stockholm so make sure to have something arranged beforehand. This is the single toughest thing many exchange students run up against.

Some of them are pretty nice!,stockholm,dd6rn7h,3,t5_2r7aq
10669136,0,t3_5sn1f8,Do the normal touristy stuff see Gamla Stan and Vasamuseum most importantly. If you just wanna hang out Id recommend Sdermalm as well vibrant part of the city. Sadly no big games this weekend that Im aware of but Djurgrden is playing a preseason friendly soccer game on sunday if youre interested. Not gonna be the greatest of games but could be fun to watch at Tele Arena. You might find some fun stuff here  as well. If youre looking for more specific stuff youll have to include some interests etc. Good luck!,stockholm,ddgfvb5,2,t5_2r7aq

11086780,0,t3_5yb7cu,To get from Arlanda to Stockholm you have several options. I would go to Arlanda Sky City SL Center and  depending on how long you stay get two day SLpasses for  SEK a piece and two ArlandaStockholm commuter train tickets for  SEK a piece for a total of xx   SEK. Then you can ride as much as you want within Stockholm.Other options ArlandaStockholm C are. The Arlanda express train  tickets fr  SEK.. Flygbussarna airport coach  ticket for  SEK.. Taxi around  SEK depending on which company you use.gt We will be arriving extremely late at night is it even possible to get over there by metro at that point? You can use the SL planner and put in From Arlanda Central and To Lilla Essingen to see when public transport is available. If you have a lot of baggade or if you arrive at an awkward time you might want to get a taxi but taxi is quite expensive in Sweden. There is no metro line on Lilla Essingen but you can travel by bus all night from Stockholm CTcentralen. There can be long waiting times between  a.m. As for what to do in Stockholm you can check some events here ,stockholm,deooddu,1,t5_2r7aq
