1543422,0,t3_2bss8o,The doctor must test you on your th day before you take your injection. Everyone metabolizes the testosterone differently. Also the medication lasts  days in the body half life and it is best to do the injections every  days or preferably  times a week small dose x a week. Also have the doctor check your estradiol estrogen levels. For most men on trt the testosterone converts to estrogen. If estrogen increases it can cause you not to notice any effects of the testosterone and even cause erectile dysfunction. Very very low chance of gyno man boobs. I do trt for a living and I have guys whose dose is anywhere from mg a week to  a week. Right before their next injection I like their levels btw . The medication peaks  days after the injection and the peak is around . Good luck man.  None of us medical people learn about trt in school and therefore no one knows how to do it properly unless they have spent countless hours researching this subject or going to conferences.

Its fairly easy to figure out with some detailed bloodwork though and a good clinicdoctor will help you figure it out.

Youve never asked what dose youre on?Injections should be administered no less frequently than once per week due to the half life of testosterone cypionate...which is about a week.Im going to guess that your doctor is giving you mg every  weeks.  If Thats the case its not a good protocol.  mg in one injection is going to send your testosterone and estradiol values through the roof.  So thats probably why your testes are migrating upward.A much more reasonable starting protocol is mg every week. ,Testosterone,cnr3ndl,2,t5_2se6p

3386046,0,t1_cpe4a9j,The reason most people start to feel like shit again after three or four months on TRT is the HPTA gets suppressed and all the other things it does stop happening. Two of those things are synthesis of dhea and pregnenolone. Rather than supplementing those two a better way to go about it is to inject HCG which is an analog of LH and will back fill all the hormonal pathways and make the body respond as if the HPTA was working again. TRT is like jump starting the car. HCG is fixing the alternator.,Testosterone,cpe8i7w,2,t5_2se6p
3416363,0,t3_2zcos7,Think about it this way very simplified...Hypogonadal patient is producing naturally at a level of ngdL. They are started on mgwk exogenous testosterone. Lets say for example that mgwk gives this individual a boost of ngdL. Their natural production does not immediately shut down the instant the injection is over the HPTA shutdown takes time. For the next few weeks the HPTA will still be producing some percentage of that initial ngdL in addition to the ngdL from the exogenous injection. As time goes on and the HPTA shutsdown completely it will no longer be contributing to the total testosterone. One week after injection the individuals levels may be at ngdL BUT  weeks levels will be coming exclusively from the exogenous source and will be only that ngdL.please keep in mind I am trying to simplify the concept to answer the question.,Testosterone,cphouc3,3,t5_2se6p

I mean to out that in perspective I feel like Ive walked out of cvs paying  when my kids get a cold thats after the doctor visit. I have or thought I had some pretty awesome insurance. But Im admittedly pretty ignorant on this.Edit I guess look at it this way if I were to go to my dr once per month and then my monthly test cost me  then its not worth the hassle to me. I would just pay the extra  to not have to deal with building the relationship. If my test was like  a month then the piece of mind of having professional oversight would be worth it.With Eastern European pharma test so cheap Im not sure even if the online clinics are worth it. I think the one I looked into only does bloods twice a year so I would still have the cost of private blood work.  which is apparently now totally illegal in my state so  for legit tryEdit  Let me ask a different way how expensive is TRT US Pharma Test when covered vs UGL Test? I ask because lets say you just went to your dr to get tested anyway and you took blood work out of it is there still a major cost difference? There is the obvious benefits of a Doctor oversight b Known qualityquantity of gear c Freenear free blood work. The down side a Potential visibility to insurance b Managing the doctors knowledge of other compounds.If you were to just let your doctor test you without prescribing TRT you would get benefits ac but not b. You would also still get downsides ab. So benefit b  cost is the deciding factor for me. I can just walk into a CityMD and get cheap bloodwork if I dont care what my insurance sees on there.

4345323,0,t3_3aq3sw,Your low creatinine and MCH could be the result of your vegetarian diet.  The elevated hemoglobin might just be due to dehydration but there are many other possible causes as well.  Are you a smoker?  Your liver and kidney function look good so those can probably be ruled out.Your DHT is likely low because your testosterone is on the low side.  Testosterone is converted into DHT so if you dont have enough testosterone you might not be able to make enough DHT.Your thyroid looks good.Your estradiol looks surprisingly good.  Id expect it to be lower since your testosterone is low.  Testosterone aromatizes into estradiol so if T is low estradiol is often low as well.  Yours looks solid.  You generally want to be closer to the top of the reference range on the nonsensitive assay since it overstates your actual estradiol value.I think running all of these same labs again is a good idea when you see your doctor.

5441717,0,t1_cw775wp,gt  why I would prefer injections over the bullshit gel she prescribedgt SheAt the risk of being accused of misogyny I seem to be noticing a trend here.... the proportion of female endos who have a clue about TRT seems to be homeopathically small. In fact I cannot recall a single case study reported here where a female endo provided a good result.Why?Maybe women are less interested in mens problems. Another theory is that given that men have a higher spread of IQs the number of women with enough brains to get into specializations is very small. Affirmative action pushes that number up with marginal and worse candidates. Even without affirmative action and other favouritism towards women the way the stats work is that  given the wider spread of mens abilities  the vast majority of women are going to barely scrape in and they therefore will be mediocre at best.This without even taking into account more recent research that suggests not only is the standard deviation for IQ higher for men but so is the average. This would make it worse.So as a heuristic I would suggest that men steer clear of female endos unless they have specific information that the particular endo is very good.My path to a good doctor for TRT was via a compounding pharmacy. I asked the pharmacist for a recommendation and the guy he recommended is terrific.inb IQ is a social construct discredited Stephen Jay Gould etc. Actually IQ is probably the best established and most useful measure in all of psychology and strongly predicts life outcomes and success in intellectually demanding work.

But imo youre better off going with injections because then you get to the end result without fiddling around with clomid which really only works while youre on it. Its not a permanent fix and there are long term side effects that you just dont have with testosterone ,Testosterone,cx7wgle,1,t5_2se6p

5894058,0,t1_cxrmqjw,There are a lot of conflicting results if you try to search for the half life of the undecanoate ester. The most common and seemingly most accurate number I have found is about  days. The Cypionate ester is  days. So in order to maintain the most stable blood levels which is what you want test C is injected at least once per week though twice per week is optimal and from my experience and others reports you feel the best. More frequent injections  more stable blood levels. So with nebido testosterone undecanoate youd want to inject every  weeks if you want the a frequency proportional to test C. Every  weeks is ludicrous. Thats equivalent to a test C injection every  weeks. You could get away with once a month injections and in all likelihood not notice the drop in testosterone levels but I would not dose it any less frequently than that. Also keep in mind that when they put the testosterone into the oil they are massing it by the weight of the compound as a whole. Test C is  testosterone per unit of mass when you factor in the weight of the ester. So per mg shot youre only getting mg of the actual hormone. Test U is  testosterone after accounting for the esters weight. So if they dont account for that difference in the weight of the ester a mg injection of test U does not yield quite the same amount of hormone as a mg injection of test C. And from what Ive seen a lot of doctors are still largely ignorant of how this all works so I doubt they would compensate for the different weight of the ester. ,Testosterone,cxs8u32,1,t5_2se6p

No sugar bread rice potato or fruit for now. Focus on low glycemic index vegetables. You will feel worse for a short time while your body adapts to using fat as a source of energy. Once you get through that you will tap into your energy reserves and start burning stored fat. You cannot effectively evaluate your hormonal function at this time. Fasting is a bad idea. It alters your metabolism and changes you metabolic set point. Your body adapts to fasting by getting more efficient at using your food which is the last thing you need. Check youtube biostraining channel for some videos about metabolism and metabolic set point.Testosterone makes you gain weight. If you eat properly on testosterone you will gain muscle. If you eat poorly on testosterone you will gain fat. You must get your diet and exercise under control before you consider using testosterone or even determining if you need testosterone.

In actual practice however its not just the most economically inefficient choice but its not a standard used by researchers or intelligent medical service providers.Why? What happens when sweat hair and clothing are added as confounding factors in the application of external exogenous T? It negatively impacts uptake. On top of that dudes who love wimmens have the added risk of making said wimmens into bearded wimmens thanks to the easy transference. Then you have the various class action lawsuits going against Abbot and Abbvie due to a significant number of injuries due to the use of Androgel. These injuries include significantly elevated risks of stroke heart attacks and blood clots.On top of the ridiculous cost you have a significant amount of anecdotal data showing that while it helps reduce the weight of your wallet it generally gives no long lasting benefit to someone who has  low t.Now lets talk about injections. Not only is this the gold standard as the t is best absorbed but risks are minimal. NIH has a large body of evidence showing the physiological level of injected doses of t have little to no side effects particularly related to cardiovascular events and that properly managed TRT using injectables also protects against prostate cancer to a degree.

8439130,0,t1_d5ggmhn,I was more ignorant than I believed at first.I still do frequent bloodwork  its probably one of the most important aspects of TRT especially when self administering. Initially I let my estro get out of control because I didnt experience acne or gyno and thought my doses of AI were appropriate.  months later I was puffy retaining massive amounts of water emotions were off and I started havin EDlike issues. I was also using dianabol at the time which accounts for the additional estrogen elevation and water retention. I know now that I can take up to around mg of test a week before I need to worry about any AI. Its something you have to learn. Admittedly its kind of scary though because youre experimenting with your own body.Get a baseline blood test done before you begin so you know what your normal levels and stats are. Then I would recommend getting bloodwork done every  weeks and adjust your AI accordingly  if it even turns out that you need one.

8505089,0,t3_4w77dl,Its nice to get prolactin levels before a guy starts TRT because a high prolactin might be the cause of the troubles prompting TRT in the first place.In rare cases there can be a tumor growing in the pituitary that is producing a lot of prolactin. If that tumor starts to squeeze your other hormoneproducing cells in pituitary they might stop working i.e. signaling production of your other hormones like thyroid testosterone cortisol hGH. In this way a tumor in the pituitary can cause low testosterone while your testes still totally healthy btw.In your case since they didnt measure your prolactin prior to TRT we have this lingering question of Are your LH amp FSH low due to a normal response while taking exogenous testosterone or are they low because there is a mass in the pituitary squeezing your LHFSHproducing cells?Even in the absence of a tumor sometimes the pituitary simply produces too much prolactin. This alone can cause symptoms like low libido and poor erectile function so you will want to get this addressed regardless.Another point on high prolactin is that it can also be caused by low thyroid. Its possible that the high prolactin resolves after thyroid is addresses. It will be between you and your doc what workup to do and what initial treatments.,Testosterone,d64ovf6,1,t5_2se6p

Quick to anger about piddly shit and let the little things bog me down. One thing Ive thought about after  years of TRT reading is thisSince most of us dont really have a clue as to what our teenage or young adult Test levels were then we dont know at what levels we need to be at to feel good unless we try right?  So some people will say maybe its depressions get looked at etc. but we also know that low Thigh E can mimic those troubles. So why go through all the trouble of psych evals and harmful prescription SSRIs when its quite possible youre hormones are causing you problems. Like you felt fine and totally NOT depressed in your teens and s then slowly in your late s you start to slide into slow motion and low motivation.  chance thats not depression IMO. Then you get labs done and it says your T is fine. So you tell yourself its not that. BUT....what if it is that and you just dont know what your numbers were when you felt like a young God. Im sure you guys take my meaning here. Feel like crap at  ngdl. Maybe felt like a god at  ngdl yet get advised not to try it. I may never know. Sad.

11395954,0,t1_dfnph9n,I was on a plateau for a few months then I started making some new PRs. However there are so many factors to that kinda stuff. Sure it could be the extra test. But especially in the gym just a little extra confidence and aggression can push you over a hump. Pretty easy to get those two things just by thinking you have some help. I mean guys doing steroids are pushing their test WAY higher and usually using much more anabolic substances than what Clomid might be doing for us. But who knows!,Testosterone,dfnpsf8,1,t5_2se6p

11551332,0,t3_64r6lh,DOMS delayed onset muscle soreness will stop happening if you start working out consistently. DOMS only happens when you havent worked out for a while or you drastically change the workout youre doing such that previously unused muscles suddenly get stressed. I lift heavy  times a week and rarely get any noticeable DOMS. I didnt notice a difference between low T and normal T. I simply had more energy during workouts.  And I hate to break it to you but building muscle with normal T levels is still hard. If it was easy for healthy people more people would be jacked. The problem I had with low T was excessive fat gain along with ANY amount of strength gains. To gain about . lbs per week with low T I had to eat  calories at  lbs. With normal T Im lbs and Im eating  calories right now and still not making the scale go up its crazy and also a bit disgusting. I eat  eggs every morning along with oatmeal and veggies.  I made some nice initial strength gains after starting TRT but  months in things have somewhat plateaued most likely because Im not eating enough.  And on top of that my sex drive never fully recovered after TRT. There was some improvement but nothing like I can remember from  years ago when I was . Its disappointing because my labs look perfect. Im just trying to accept it.    My point is TRT is not magic. Although things horribly sucked before Im only normal now just like any other healthy guy out there. Your T levels look healthy but you should investigate Sensitive E like others have said. I doubt TRT is going to make any noticeable differences for you you should so some research and try to critically analyze what could be wrong with your current workout routine. As for sex drive make sure you arent stressed get rid of drugsalcohol and eatsleep right. Thats all I got.,Testosterone,dg5chqk,3,t5_2se6p

11600062,0,t1_dgauksr,Mine says its in Cottonseed oil and it contains Benzyl Benzoate as a preservative. This is from the little mL vials of which I still have  before I get a mL vial. Even though E.D is probably the most common advice here I cant stomach the thought of being this sore for nearly every day of the week. Maybe Ill try it one weekI try my best not to move the needle around when its in but god damn I really had to press down on the plunger hard for anything to come out. It feels like someone hit me in the leg with a baseball bat and I did this on Thurs. Thats why I normally go VG because that can hurt all it wants to and it doesnt affect walking just laying down on that side.  I just get whatever Walgreens has my man. I sort of doubt theyd be willing to do anything but sell whats on their shelves either. Plus I dont have the money for custom stuff assuming its  I just use a GoodRX coupon to buy the stuff out of pocket you know?So I think G  mL syringes are out of the question for Cottonseed.

I dont know.  Im done having kids.  I take it to stop raisin balls and for smoothing out the mood.  It works for that.  Sometimes E feels too high so I occasionally dial back to IU.
