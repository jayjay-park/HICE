6530798,0,t1_czusspu,I appreciated hearing from guilters who we dont normally hear from. Its too bad they dont post more regularly. What youre describing is called cognitive dissonance and it is rampant over on the DS. They cherrypick which conflicting bit of information fits their narrative best. Even before this when the Nisha interview notes came out they collectively decided that her actual testimony under oath was worth less than the casual scribbles of the BPD. Ive said before that I dont actually get annoyed with people being biased. I think its human and its better to know peoples biases upfront than to mistakenly believe they are robots. What I do find problematic is the assertion that their conclusions are born of pure logic and reason and incorporate no bias and that everyone else who contradicts them is an overly emotional idiot conspiracy theorist or whatever.

6911338,0,t1_d0zfdbu,gtWhere is this character letter? This theory is asking you to swallow the idea that Asia wrote two letters to Adnan expressing belief in his innocence and then when Adnan wrote her a character letter to type up even though she sent him two phone numbers and instructions on when to call her she just . . . didnt. Frankly you should be offended that Justin Brown would insult your intelligence with such nonsense.That really isnt at all what I think. Not to mention I read Juuans snippet way before Justin Brown said anything about it and my takeaway was that it was most likely regarding the character letters that AS legal team was asking for. That was a very natural thought. For example when I read it I thoughtas I stated beforethat either Justin and Juuan received a request via a form letter to write up a character letter I was thinking not directly from Adnan in the jail but from the mosque communitylegal teamtrying to remember so feel free to correct where I may be getting it wrong and they were discussing it and Asia mentioned she sent Adnan a letter too and they assumed it was the character letter when really it was just one of the letters she sent on her own or She was asked to send a character letter in the same manner Justin and Juuan werethis form letter as well and sent it but sent it to the wrong address if she sent something to the wrong address it must have gotten returned right or otherwise how would she know? if so perhaps she dindt resend bc she didnt know where or just didnt bc by that time she thought he was guilty.  this would explain why there is no Asia character letter. Or maybe there is and we just arent aware. Have all the character letters been released? I ask bc I really dont know. I guess the way I see it is that while the theory is interesting and full of the kind of intrigue that would make a great storybook plot twist but the mechanics of it seem pretty unlikely. That is why I say as a theory fine. I am all for theoriesno matter how far fetched I may personally think they are and I enjoy discussing them as we are here but any claim that it is for sure or most likely is a little much for meespecially when there are reasonable explanations to be had. Also when the other person accepts they are a theory and is okay with discussing them without accusing the other of being intellectually dishonest.  I mean they were kidsthere are all kinds of misunderstandings and miscommunication that happens and gets passed on to other kids like the game telephone thats how a lot of gossip works.  I still dont understand for example  why Juuan would say that he and Justin got one too if the fact that Asia supposedly got one would be such a big deal. Its also hard to believe that they wouldnt want to at least bring someone in talk to them if they thought there had been an attempt to create a fake alibi. Imagine if they were able to put her on the stand for the state? It is hard to believe the prosecution would just saymeh we have enough no need to add insult to injury. gtPresumably she got it from the defense file not from the MPIA. It was given to the defense in January .but...if the interview was with the policethen the police would have it wouldnt they?  Or are you asserting that perhaps they gave the original to the defense? Speaking of audioI wasnt just wondering about this specific but audio in general. I wonder why it isnt part of the MPIAI guess that is just standard practice? Not so much asking you as just thinking out loud here. Juuans affadavit seemed to me to be clarifying the incident as a whole.  Do you think he is deliberately lying about this incident or just somehow not understandingI have to say thoughif you are correct and Judge Welch happens to grant relief surely TV would get the audioshould already have it if it is part of the defense file right? and use it on appeal. Or couldnt have even file a supplement now? Or are you suggesting that TV would not have access to it? I will tell you thisif it eventually gets released and there is clearing incriminating information on it I promise Ill get angry with UD and I promise that I will be sayingoh Seamus why oh why didnt I listen to you! I dont feel that way though about this thing with the library being visited bc I dont think it is as big of a deal as you do. That is just my honest opinion. Did Collin leave it out purposely? Maybe but I guess since I dont see it is a big bombshell of any kind it doesnt really infuriate me. Seem he was focused on the track alibi. If Mills had any recollection of the meeting that would have been helpful but just the bare fact that Davis went there isnt doing it for me. It has been interesting hearing more about this in depth. I still dont think it is the most likely scenario but it is interesting to discuss. ,SerialThunderDome,d0zpyll,3,t5_3b8nf

The thing in all this that upsets me is when Rabia and her crew used a cropped portion of her diary to say she used drugs and theorize that could have played a role in her murder.  There was no evidence of a drug deal gone wrong.  That was gross to me. I honestly thing that Adnan would have been smart to paint his relationship with Hae more honestly.

Everything the reporter was saying was revealed to be nonsense such as his defence of the police trying to change witnesses minds that is definately not their job as he says.... Lots of really key evidence and issues with evidence   highlighted in the podcast came out for the first time in a way that made it clear that the reporter knew about it all but had not informed the audience.After listening to the interview I was honestly shocked at how much basic info that might make you question Jays guilt was simply ignored. Made it seem to me like the reporter had jumped into a crusade without understanding it all. And he was a crime reporter for did he say  years yiirc? yet kept making such fallacious assumptions in the interview about if Jay not speaking at the trial meant anything about police interfering with witnesses about his stupid all of this list of witnesses must be wrong stuff about his automatic discounting of the more solid witnesses Jay had in defence  especially when he was like a few have now said they might have got it wrong therefore theyre all flimsy as if the shop keepers evidence wouldnt have been important even without the other witnesses etc. about the idea that Jay should have had his own theory to prove about what happened etc.To discount the shop keepers testimony from what the same day? While arguing so strongly for the credibility of witnesses coming forward years later says everything I think.

He had slept with several of the other employees and she knew but was so infatuated with him that she wouldnt break off the relationship.So one day manager dude was screwing some young chick IN THE LIQUOR STORAGE ROOM at work and manager chick girlfriend heard about it and went to investigate.  Instead of being pissed at him she beat the shit out of the little girl and then we found her and the manager guy IN THE SAME LIQUOR STORAGE ROOM later that night.There was also the guy who decided messing around with one of the underage girls was a good idea even though he was in his late s.  They slept together for a while and she started getting hung up on him as young girls do.  One night while they were both working they ended up in a huge fight about him flirting with someone else and she accused him of having a small dick.  His reply was You seemed to like its size when I had it buried in your ass.

Its horrible that mass attacks are happening but lets not discount the fact that mass attacks happen from white people and Europeans themselves as well. The unfortunate side effect from having a global hour news cycle that is accessible through one click is that we are going to hear about bad people doing bad things. The reasons are countless and never justifiable but they will happen daily. Our problem as humans is the idea that we think we can insulate ourselves from bad acts by locking a door. We cant. We have to accept that globally we contribute to the anger and resentment of people living in exile and poverty. We have to accept that by being participants or allies of a neverending war machine we are contributing to death tolls anger resentment and oppression. We have to accept that the way we find solutions is to offer safe havens deliver people from exile and teach people how to leave their own oppressors whether they be physical or theological. Installation and practice of religion is a crime that makes criminals who seek to soothe their pain through fanaticism and seeking the rewards of empty promises.The final solution is education socialization and ending the war machines. Thats the solution that we will need to practice globally and immediately. We need to build longer tables instead of higher walls.

If she proposed it as an option whatever. Its ridiculous but at least it wouldnt be a mandate. What does it have to do with English lit anyway?Im all for inclusiveness but the shit privileged liberals get outraged over is a huge sore spot for me. There is a finite amount of energy to go around and this is not a worthy cause. People who identify as anything other than male or female are a very small minority. If an individual expresses a request to be referred to as something else then sure he she they can make it clear and their wishes should be respected but the idea that its on everyone else to know and to change is nonsense. What about the kids who want to be referred to by their gender identity? Its not just alienating for cisgender people but transgender people who actively WANT to be seen as male or female.Its the same bullshit as safe spaces and trigger warnings. ,SerialThunderDome,d7amvyb,5,t5_3b8nf

There are also often Groupons for Barre classes. Barre is a balletpilatesyoga combo boutique workout kind of experience but it is effective low impact modifiable to your skill can be high cardio or low cardio and really stresses body awareness so its great for people that want to improve their coordination. IMO its the best workout available for people that arent really into traditional exercise like weight lifting or running or jump roping ha or competitive high octane stuff like crossfit. However if you are into those things it might not be your cup of tea. ,SerialThunderDome,d7la8qa,4,t5_3b8nf
