1327002,0,t3_28wxug,So I hooked up with him again last night and now my wife is pissed. She wasnt mad at me for going she was mad that when he texted me for a booty call I got up and got dressed before talking to her about it. Shes also mad that I havent set rules for him  limitations on when he can contact me and when Ill respond. Im not trying to start a structured relationship with him. Its just spontaneous really good sex granted its on his terms not mine. I guess if I want this to continue Im going to have to find a way to make it work for all of us.One positive I learned last night is that he is nearly  not barely  so thats good.,MarriedAndBi,ciiwkyk,1,t5_326p5
3015109,0,t1_coahngf,The sexual spectrum and experience makes complete sense I probably communicated some of that poorly as well.Youre right and I do feel bit embarrassed for being childish that I didnt get a popsicle and am keeping score to a certain extent. Your post along with therapy has me coming to the conclusion that I have not let myself enjoy life how Ive wanted instead care taking for others.I have talked with her about it the past and she has forbidden it. I am not interested in other romantic relationships I just want to know and enjoy an intimate experience with a man. Until I have the chance I cannot tell if its something I just want once or would need a nonmonogamous relationship.It sounds like I need to do a great deal of thinking and decide on what is most important to me. Thank you for your perspective and input!,MarriedAndBi,coaij2u,1,t5_326p5
6943382,0,t3_44z30v,So sorry to hear this OP. Your wife is living in an open marriage and you are not. That isnt fair and her being bisexual is irrelevant. Cheating is cheating and that is what she is doing. When one person in a couple has an affair whether it is physical emotional or both without the others agreement that affair is out of line. Im a bi man in a monogamous relationship with my straight wife. If she had an affair and then ended it she needs to completely distance herself from her affair partner. If the both of you participated in the affair that would be a different thing. Right now she wants to eat her cake and have it too. ,MarriedAndBi,d13d1nk,2,t5_326p5

I have called my insurance to set up a search for an appropriate therapist. I will look into testing for diseases. I know I owe her the truth but I guess I feel like I might be doing her somewhat of a disservice by choosing to throw our home life into turmoil. ,MarriedAndBi,d2pyz35,1,t5_326p5
