5575683,0,t1_cwo7eyx,Googles project wing drops a fishingline of sorts not sure about Amazons implementation. I like Googles implementation because its a hybrid. It has vertical takeoff and hover capabilities of a multicopter but the great efficiency and long range of fixed wing aircraft. This way its able to travel longer distances using less energy. The only prototypes Ive seen from Amazon are regular multicopter designs which isnt as efficient for long distance travel as fixed wing.,AutonomousNews,cwo7raa,1,t5_36ecn
