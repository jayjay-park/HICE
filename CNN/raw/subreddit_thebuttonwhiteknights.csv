4009687,0,t3_36eqqk,I like that idea I changed the header. I spent like  minutes on it though just so we had something cool for new people coming here. I can look into better images I like the Pegasus idea. The angle wings represent the guarding quality I think all white nights should have at least to me. Thanks for all your hard work!,thebuttonwhiteknights,crdc2dt,2,t5_389fj
