3184781,0,t1_corws3l,Those are obviously the richest and quite small parts of what is an enormous city. Its the ugliest city I have ever seen filthy and no sense of zoning or planning. But the people are nice so there is that. I may also be jaded because before living here I had lived in Barcelona and then Lisbon. Lisbon being truly one of the worlds most beautiful cities. But Sampa is really kind of a shit hole.,saopaulo,cos3p5b,1,t5_2rk0t

5510694,0,t1_cwfzr5r,not really. japanese food in sao paulo can be really good but really expensive. rodizio is like a buffet quantity over quality. personally i would always choose quality over quantity especially if you are on holiday,saopaulo,cwg1hwf,4,t5_2rk0t
5510757,0,t1_cwg1hwf,Maybe some rodzios are shitty buffets but Ive always gone to places where they make everything to order. Tamagochi that I mentioned has a R rodzio and its also the best Japanese food Ive ever eaten.Personally Ive only ever paid per piece for Japanese food when at a mall getting Ghendai or something.,saopaulo,cwg1sbb,1,t5_2rk0t

7529950,0,t3_4igw5g,Jardins will give you some impressive houses to see but overall a problem with street view is that housesapartment buildings in SP are walled up for security. Only rarely can you see anything from the street.,saopaulo,d2y4a6d,9,t5_2rk0t
9380860,0,t3_590c8g,My dad once hiked to the top of pedra da boracia Doesnt seem very close to the city. He said it has a beautiful view. Also its not a mountain I dont think brazil has any mountains,saopaulo,d9539zv,1,t5_2rk0t
10621167,0,t3_5ru862,A decent alternative to jardins is pinheiros right next to it. I lived in  different apartments there and really liked that area. The fradique coutinho metro is brand new and the area is less congested and less expensive than the others you are looking at. Boa sorte!,saopaulo,ddbhr65,2,t5_2rk0t
11727858,0,t1_dgp3sly,For at least one weekend I would go to So Paulo the other I dont know. Cant help you much about there since I usually go there for work was there this morning. I love the old downtown even if its a little dangerous. The Avenida Paulista rea is pretty cool too. Around here you have some nice parks and some decent bars and clubs. If you can rent a car there are some nice waterfalls about half an hour from here not sure where but my friends go sometimes. If you stay near the Cambu neighborhood there are some great restaurants and nightlife nearby.,saopaulo,dgpdt19,1,t5_2rk0t
