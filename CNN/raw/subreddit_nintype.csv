2598812,0,t1_cmxprx2,Looks like SubtleLock or LockHTML for lockscreen time and date ProrityHub for the lockscreen notification JellyLock for the circle at the bottom of the lockscreen Protean for the statusbar MiniPlayer for the music widget ?? for the folder icon tweak ?? for the transparent dock  multiple ways to achieve this Circulus for the icons Articon for changing the music app icon to reflect now playing album Messages Customiser for the messages app Copic KualDial ChatPic or xMessages for contact photos inside the conversation Eclipse for the dark look of the UI ?? for the keyboard  it looks like stock though just Eclipsified,nintype,cmxsvf5,2,t5_3407v

3123809,0,t3_2vwbwy,Well Im not sure what the best terminology is at any rate  I just let people decide what they think it sounds like and when I gather enough sample they can be called whatever most people call them.Flick phrases is a good term though. Period key behavior is kinda hard to summarize to a simple phrase.As for the tutorial  probably missing a How do I swipe with nintype? It actually is quite a bit different than what people seem to expect especially when they come from other swipe keyboards. I might do yet another video after the one here  But other than that features tutorials seem okay I only skimmed through some. Might be important to note that a lot of the features are now disabled until you turn on advanced mode  to make users less confused and the like,nintype,cols5bn,2,t5_3407v

3906393,0,t1_cr0prbm,So I installed the app opened the actually app and followed the instructions to add it to the keyboard list then went into messages and tried to type something with it. I tried to switch to Nintype from my other third party keyboard TouchPal but Nintype didnt show up just nothing no keyboard was showing and after a while the stock keyboard showed up. I tried to respring it and that did nothing. So I thought is it because the tweaks I installed so I went into safe mode still nothing. I finally restarted my phone and somehow it worked.,nintype,cr1kaap,1,t5_3407v

5298771,0,t3_3nl0fn,to get the sounds have you tried opening the keyboard and adjusting the volume up or down? I have ran into that problem myself and and stupid and silly as it seems that was the fix  of the time. it seems that Nintype sounds are totally separate from OS sounds and have to be adjusted with the keyboard open. if that doesnt work and you are running a jailbroken device Id suggest running iCleaner and see if that helps. Now with the other problem of sentenceswords reappearing I believe that is a bug that has resurfaced because I get it too since the newest testflight update and if I remember right this was something uunderthesun had fixed before. Can anyone else confirm that?,nintype,cvoz9ev,2,t5_3407v

6860457,0,t1_d0tbiqh,With the squishing thing itll sometimes work fine still and I can type without looking half the time so its not till i look down and im like uh ok because it appears so broken but functions perfectly. But other times it does this then straight crashes seconds laterYeah keyboard not showing happens for me with basically every third party keyboard. Quite painful dammit apple. It especially never appears for me on facebook messenger quick reply creen Ive not even had it show onceIm on .b and yeah same behaviour Ive always had on . Its slightly better than it was on  I think but that could also be the upgrade from iPhone  to s. Hopefully the GM comes soon and fixes a bunch of stuff because this is seriously a joke like come on apple.,nintype,d0txx6j,1,t5_3407v
7635421,0,t1_d39uglg,thats not nearly enough. using chooseboard and running activator scripts to kill and restart the process made a much more substantial improvement over jetslam alone. itd still bug out and navigating between text input fields required a keyboard close or ninapp restart,nintype,d3a3se5,1,t5_3407v

11757531,0,t3_67efpv,Well Im on android . and Im experiencing some problems. The keyboard doesnt seem to stay in memory and when you click on a text box the process has to restart. Takes about  seconds for the keyboard to come up every time you want to type. Also it crashes and  restarts the keyboard whenever you try to go into the settings. I might have to go back to the old nintype until this gets resolved.,nintype,dgsqv72,1,t5_3407v
