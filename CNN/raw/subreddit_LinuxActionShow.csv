2006065,0,t3_2hpro1,From  to  I used to do the desktop publishing for a monthly newsletter  typically  to  A pages.  When I started on it in  the author had been using Microsoft Publisher.  I moved it to InDesign on Windows because that was what I used at work for writing and publishing technical training manuals.  In about  when my copy of indesign would no longer install without errors and I was no longer writing training manuals for a living I changed to Scribus on Linux.  Since  Ive started using Scribus to self publish a series of books.I found the transition from InDesign to be easy from a Users standpoint  if you could use InDesign then Scribus was easy to pickup.  The absolutely major pain was migrating existing documents from InDesign to Scribus. at the time  there were no export or import tools that would migrate existing documents from one programme to the other.  Fortunately for the newsletters I only had to migrate advertisements to Scribus and it was easier to recreate them in Scribus than to try and migrate an existing page layout from InDesign.  I understand that there are now migration tools available if you have to migrate existing page layouts.When I first started self publishing my books I had some difficulty with colour control.

Youll first look through RPMFusion which has popular rd party stuff but far from everything then through Fedora People Repos Copr some RPM repo by the developer and if you still didnt find an RPM you build it from source manually. Fedora is one of the worst distros if you want to use exotic rd party apps.    On Ubuntu just get the PPA. On Arch just install it from the AUR. As easy as that. Ubuntu is often targeted by developers directly. Almost nobody packages for Fedora. Most devs dont want to package for any distro.

Im not making the rest of this comment with a snarky attitude so please dont take it that way.I did the post the way I did out of response to my own experience when I was trying to set a system up for myself. I recall getting frustrated that I would have to follow links to all kinds of other posts and as a new user it bothered me. Basically I didnt write the post for the average Linux Action Show user which is why I didnt post it here myself. I wanted it to be a guide for newbies so thats why theres a bit of handholding going on.To fill in the other parts which I do recognize are more interesting than the process itselfgtWhy is Debian compelling for this task? Im sure there are lots of Arch users thinking that a very focused super slick Arch installation is ways better than Debian...I chose Debian because A Im most comfortablefamiliar with Debian and B I wanted something that was more stable. This is not me saying Arch or any other rollingrelease is unstable I mean it in the sense that I only use this install once a week at best and only for a couple hours at a time. I dont want to have to go through changelogs and notifications to watch for areas of possible concern. gtIs stable with some backports enough up to date for a recording box or is testing mandatory?Stable would probably have been fine for most cases. I actually have the sources file pointing to jessie and not testing so once jessie is the stable release it will be on that. I did this because there were a couple things I wanted to update to the release in those repos patchage ardour lightdm XFCE GTK for the sake of the theme I prefer the kernel for hardware enablement. gtDid you have driver issues with your hardware drivers? How did you worked them around?The only two issues Ive experienced with hardware was my broadcom wifi card and the Beats Audio speakers. I switched to the nonfree repos to include the wifi driver and I havent bothered to do anything with the beats system because my output for this install goes through my interface which works OOTB with JACK.gtDid you have any issue in basic sound management to deal with? I mean pulse audio  alsa etc.The only problem Ive run into as far as sound managementrouting was trying to playback an audio clip into JACK for recordingmonitoring in Ardour. Both Audacity and VLC need the clip to be cued and paused for the output to get listed in JACK before I can assign the path. I usually just get around this by hooking my phone to one of the inputs on my interface and playing the clips from there.I may make a summary post in this series that covers your questions and gives some other insights into why I chose to do things the way I did. If anyone else has suggestions about things I might be able to do like the VLCAudacity clip playback issue Id be more than happy to check them out.,LinuxActionShow,coh0qem,2,t5_2sp2j

For instance I contributed yad fork of zenity and pianobar I tried clementine but the release needed a patch that I couldnt get working so I can tell you its not that difficult to get packages into the main repo. Is it the AUR? No...but its close and packages are audited by the lead devs.  One of the coolest things about Void is its build system which is more or less a script that spins up a chroot where you get to test and build your packages. Packages are automatically built for many platforms including ARM so for example pianobar should be in the repos for the Raspberry Pi version of Void.  Void still needs a lot of work but I can honestly say they work their butts off every day. I subscribe to their github feed I suggest you do the same and constantly see new packages added daily. Id really like to get Juan on LAS because I think void is great and needs the attention.  All in all very great young distro with a promising future ahead. Please install Void on a spare machine or like me your main box.,LinuxActionShow,corelpx,2,t5_2sp2j

3214331,0,t1_couup0w,gt flexibility with rd party tools is a feature  Yes I will agree with that. But it depends how this extendability is implemented. In Firefox I have never had my extensions break on me after version update. And I also am a diehard ff user. On the other hand gnome shell update breaks extensions every single time. On the third hand xfce has all the necessary features out of the box there is no need for applets or extensions because You can do almost everything within the DE.  Btw I hate whisker menu and prefer the old one. I use synapse as a launcher and the old menu can be navigated using keyboard.gt   mate developers  Yes I agree that is impressive. To be fair almost all of xfce development process is basically behind closed doors cause they dont advertise anything. I dont really understand whats the problem with switching to GTK or wayland support etc so I cannot comment on that  gt Goals are not similar  Youre right I shouldve said end result instead of goals. I hope that . which will come out any day now will revitalize xfce and maybe help the developers to pick up the pace have a public roadmap blog with updates etc.  xfce as it is now is a fully functinal DE. Its not like the development is slow and the DE is half finished. So while true they could get things done better and quicker It doesnt matter that much to me personally cause I have  features of what I need already implemented,LinuxActionShow,cov60jf,1,t5_2sp2j

Some simple application in desktop startup maybe.Desktop notifications can suffer from same problems as log can. Do too much logging and not only logs became unreadable you also hog the machine.

3939923,0,t1_cr5dhyb,In terms of having your own snappy store I found this    Question  gt Just to be sure. With snappy it wont be possible to host an additional snappy repository myself just like in the old apt days?I do understand that the introduction of a config parameter like this would possibly compromise the reliability of the system. But there a some companies out there that would have a huge problem with a repository that is not located within their IT. Would the only possible workaround be the direct distribution via SSH?  Answer  gt For Snappy we are making a different set of promises than we are for the traditional aptbased Ubuntus. Related to apps we guarantee a higher level of security by confining apps tightly and restricting what they can do so they can be reliably upgraded and never break anything outside of themselves. The tradeoff is that a central repository becomes crucial to be able to guarantee that all apps have been confined properly and dont override any other apps. That does mean that you cant mix and match selfhosted apps with store apps without forgoing most of the promises that Snappy makes. For companies that need to keep apps within their infrastructure we will offer satellite stores on a commercial basis which will let them mix and match apps in a secure way that still plays well with the rest of the ecosystem.  .  gt As long as people have access to tools which are free software btw to create snaps as long as they can implement sanppy packages in their distros why would we actually need access to their backend?    If you open a .snap youll see that its basically a fancy deb package. So while its pretty easy to package the snappy tools for other distros. Doing the installing assumes that youre on a Debian based distro with all the deb packaging tools.  Its not a  from scratch new packaging format with everything around it reinvented.,LinuxActionShow,cr5dvca,1,t5_2sp2j

5815846,0,t3_3urwwt,Okay I just tried the RC and here are two small design problems after a quick check. Mind you I am a KDE user through and through so Budgie is not really what I am used to . The title bar of a window is freaking huge. I tried it on my netbook with x screen my standard test machine if it cant run on it its too heavy   and it takes a lot of space. It isnt that relevant on big desktop monitors but Your Average User aka a target of this distro I think often uses laptop. On laptops x is still pretty common I think. That title bar will be freaking huge as well.. The start button activation area needs to extend towards the corner and touch the corner. You cannot expect user to target that circle that can get very small.Other than that I think that Budgie is very nice. Not sure if its for me but perhaps I will check it out in the future and perhaps then it will click. I would still prefer my openSUSE base though On the not that much related note I am amazed that GNOME Document Viewer still doesnt support .epub and .djvu formats. After having Okular which opens just about everything on board for so long its just... not acceptable.

Its not like its something you wont ever need again or wont need to use in another system its just that installing arch let me do all of this when I was not in panic since my system was broken it let me calmly learn things that helps me fix my own and other peoples system without focusing on locating an error rather to focus on how the tools and stuff works and to be able to take the time to read through manpages and stuff so I dont think going through an arch install is as fruitless as he seems to think.

7206270,0,t1_d1wwo6r,Weve seen a fairly dramatic shift from virusesworms to Trojans over the last decade.  This is largely due to browsers and OSes becoming a harder target than users.  The reason this matters is that the barrier to entry is much lower when it comes to creating a Trojan compared to finding bugs and successfully exploiting them.  As a result the rate at which new Trojans are coming out is exceeding the detection rate by larger margins than other forms of malware.But wait you say arent Linux users harder targets than dumb Windows users? Yes and no.  Linux suffers from Bushnells Law  Its easy to play difficult to master.  While typing text into a black window is generally considered to be power user territory we still do a lot of stupid things    curl L plaintexturl.org | bashEverything from installing unvetted WP plugins to using poor password safety we Linux folkdespite our know betterdo a lot of stupid things.

7261138,0,t3_4etnda,Interrupting a VM especially one of a more modern operating system can reeeeeaaally throw it for a loop since most modern OSes have regular checks to make sure errors arent happening and theyre a bit more particular about how they handle data. Older OSes are a bit dumber and tend to be less picky.In terms of the sleep thing Your VM has literally no way of knowing that the host machine is going to sleep so youre practically crashing it when you do that. Youre cutting off its resources midprocess and then bringing them back when your PC wakes. You have to remember to treat VMs as if they are indeed their own machines extensions and paravirtualization might help them run better as a VM but youre still running software intended for PC hardware inside of another program. Its a good idea to just shut down your VM entirely if it doesnt take well to being suspended amp restored. Some OSes just dont tolerate it as well as others.,LinuxActionShow,d23jggv,1,t5_2sp2j

Any spinoff that resolved that issue would be more than welcome to submit it to openSUSE which I realise reduces the need for such a spinoffThat is absolutely true. I am wondering though in your opinion would there be any resistance if someone were to submit fixes for the above grievances New GUI Package Manager etc? Would there be any pushback from devs who may already be happy with the way things are in openSUSE? I only ask because...Well I just kinda assumed that someone would have tried to do some of that type of stuff already. And I honestly dont know what the devscommunitys feelings on that type of stuff would be This is of course all under the assumption that the submitted fixes would be well written secure code. gt We do ship with some proprietary software which we are legally entitled to distribute.gt Regarding codecs we do not have such a right this is a legal reality of any project operating in US Jurisdictions. I think many other distributions and spinoffs take risks in this area which would not be sensible for a project of openSUSEs size history and stature to make.Absolutely and Im not suggesting openSUSE take on the very real risk of being sued for all theyre worth just for some codecs. But you must admit having those codecs out of the box is something a lot of novice users want and a spinoff taking on that risk certainly makes it appealing to many as it is able to offer something that openSUSE proper cannot.Also sorry for the late response ,LinuxActionShow,d5scsi5,1,t5_2sp2j

I think the answer is mixing up the current show. Bohus idea would mix it up and perhaps you may find you could mix it up even more than that.LAS feels pretty rigid. That may work for some people but loosening it up a bit may be beneficial. Lets consider a possible timeline with entirely random examples simply for the sake of kicking around ideas.Week   Whoa heartbleed is out. Cover it until you turn blue in the face. Thats serious business. Thats big news.Week   Slow news week. No need to beat the drum with minor news and span that the entire show. Toss in a howto. I wouldnt mind hearing about firewalls. Noahs insight would shine there. Hit me with all of the technical details. I want the nitty gritty.Week   Firewalls are a bit advanced for the average Joe. Time to slow it down. Lets talk about the basics. Visit the early episode User Error? of you helping Chase in regard to getting his feet wet with Linux. That was a magical episode and one I think can be built on more. How do you make a Linux installer? Both Mac and Windows folks are coming to Linux  cover both angles. What can you do in a live environment? I do data recoveries in a live environment. What if I didnt know how  could you cover that?Week   Its been a long month. Lets kick the feet up. Crack open a beer or two on air. Maybe you could have a guest just to hash out some discussions. Maybe Lunduke or Hartley could drop in. I love Chris and Noah. I am also very fond of Matt and Bryan. We love you guys all of you. Youre all Linuxy guys doing Linuxy things. Were all in this together. Lets argue about Tumbleweed vs Arch. Throw in a rant or two. Keep it loose.Let the order be dictated by the news. Say we have Heartbleed and Dirty Cow back to back. Okay fine two big news weeks then this then that etc. It is after all the Linux Action Show. Mixing it up is kind of... actiony. Isnt it? PBut seriously  you guys do a great job as is. Im a fan.

11633302,0,t1_dgei2zn,Before everything happened I will just leave that comment like that ... I had the preshow on in the background and honestly I think Noah and Chris both had good points.I think a good review ... say Gentoo being reviewed by someone really passionate about it like DasGregor sorry to bring a guy I like so much into this thread P  is really better then someone glancing over it really fast and not giving it a fair shake ...whatever the distro is .Chris also had a fair point that when you ARE so passionate about a distro you may not point out the distros downsides as much as others ...Really a good distro ...er what is the word .... a good set of distros? ???? has both kindsHate to seem like I am always bringing up Mint but I love Mint ... it has never let me down and I can hear people like Popey Ikey WImpy and Mr. Tunnell  P  attack the way Mint does stuff and while OTHERS not those four tend to spread alot of FUD about the project .... I can even say ... Those guys have decent points when they bring those things upuChrisLAS that still reminds me of one of my favorite LUPs though I wish wimpy and popey could have made it ... it was the AppImage vs Snap vs ..etc episode where Ryan and Ikey completely disagreed ... were respectful and had a really good debate. ,LinuxActionShow,dgenban,2,t5_2sp2j
11669037,0,t1_dgint9g,Theres a huge difference between when you stop listening to the Podcast and posting garbage speculation and complaining about a Podcast that you dont have to pay for. It shows a sense of entitlement acting like even though Chris and Noah work hard and we dont pay them we still get to be critical of their friendship and then when it is removed to complain about sensorship and repaste it in.,LinuxActionShow,dgip8vg,1,t5_2sp2j
