9826053,0,t1_daoa8pw,Likewise thank you for your respectful engagement. These days things quickly boil down to insults. I obviously agree with you on Gay marriage armed service trying to sexually reprogram kids to be straight conversion therapy etc... But so do most republicans Ive met. Nearly all conservatives have put these things are in the past just as the democratic party has put the KKK in the past. Sure conservatives  or  years ago would be weird about me being gay but this has changed.Ive been to many high profile right wing events in the United States and Europe and have found especially in Europe that people on the right arent homophobic at all but the media portrays them as such.More interesting is that many gays seem to want socialism and economic interventionism. You can be perfectly socially liberal on issues surrounding homosexuality without demanding that the state raise taxes redistribute money etc...Also I am conservative because Im deeply worried about less tolerant groups like Muslims who attack gays France has seen a  rise in hate crimes against gays  especially gays in the Arab or Berber communities. ,LGBTPolitics,daoctd1,1,t5_2uvz2
9826217,0,t1_daoctd1,Interesting. I guess you are the example of the diversity of the other side. Honestly I didnt expect Trump to win because the Republican party in the U.S. has been a snake eating its own tail and now the Democrats are similar as well. Frankly I wish we could have  or more distinct parties. The religious right the Reagan era oldschool Republicans the corporate democrats the progressive Bernie crowd and the Libertarians. Hell make another party just for the Trumpaltright crowd. Anyway I understand your concerns about extremist Muslims but the vast majority of Muslims in America are tolerant of gays the way Christians are. I should know I live in Minneapolis and interact with lots of MuslimAmericans every day. If anything I think Muslims in America are more tolerant than the Evangelicals. The Muslims I meet are live and let live and vote for gay rights.  The Evangelicals Ive met fight against gay rights. We dont really have ISIS people here. Those people sneak in sometimes or are indoctrinated here. But the rest just came here to live their moderate Muslim lives in peace as a proud American.But if I were you Id motivate your party and your Republican allies to fight hard against the Mike Pence agenda. We cant go backwards and I agree that Pence is extreme for the majority of American Republicans. Our political system is a clusterfuck right now. I want healthy parties on both sides. Only time will tell I guess.,LGBTPolitics,daodl44,1,t5_2uvz2
