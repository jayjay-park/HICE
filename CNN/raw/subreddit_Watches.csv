20330,0,t1_cegp61r,Its probably the only invicta worth your time. It uses a very good Seiko movement so itll be reliable in that department. I hear the build quality isnt bad on this one either  cant say the same for anything else by invicta though. Having said that considering it uses a Seiko movement why not just get a Seiko instead? Loads of Seikos in your price range and theyre a respected company by watch lovers and normal people alike. That invicta wont win you any fans with watch enthusiasts  invicta are a bit of a wideboy company but that watch is a solid piece based on price and inner workings and if youre not bothered about what watch nerds think and most people arent then its a good piece to go for.If still get a Seiko  myself though.,Watches,cegqxaz,3,t5_2qls5

48502,0,t1_cejwrbx,Sub is anything but flashy IMO. Daytona is great but there are other chronos I like just as much. Datejust is flashy I suppose in that its probably the most recognizable as a Rolex to the general public. Of course Rolex makes bling bling versions of everything too. The other day I was looking at a GMT II and saw the ruby and sapphire Pepsi bezel version. Straight outta Vegas!To the OP  congrats on the new watch! I have to be honest that I dont share the love for the Pepsi bezel that most people here do but I dont hate it either. I prefer the black bezel or the new blackblue.

64316,0,t1_celkxkp,Going off on a tangent here... I feel inhouse movements are overrated. If the movement is actually an upgrade over a topChronometer grade ETA or a modified ETA in terms of durability functionality or timekeeping then it would be worth the extra cost. However many of the entry level inhouse movements out there dont really offer any advantages over a top of the line ETA. Going back to the Pelagos it at least houses a modified top grade ETA According to a watchmaker at WUS its shock protection system is changed from Incabloc to Kif and the ETACHRON system is replaced with a more traditional system stud on balance spring and traditional regulator pins. The latter is apparently a disadvantage for watchmakers though as it makes it harder to adjust the movement.,Watches,celr36e,15,t5_2qls5

102325,0,t3_1v9lly,An interesting question. Singling out Rolex may be a bit unfair as there is an entire tier of superluxury watches priced above Rolexes. These tend to be handfinished Patek Vacheron AP etc whereas Rolexes are machinemade albeit by highly precise and proprietary machines. Rolex makes nearly a million watches a year so there is actually not too much exclusivity associated with owning one. But their automatic movements are incredibly durable and precise and in fact remain the envy of sportwatch makers the world over. Designs are classic and rarely updated. Pricing has gotten a bit out of control in recent years. Some argue that Rolex is pricing itself out of the upper middle class market it cut its teeth on. Most of their sport models now start around  or  for stainless steel versions. ,Watches,ceq2x2e,2,t5_2qls5

161538,0,t1_cewthia,gt Who does that money actually go to? The delivery company as a fee for handling this VAT payment?Yes.  weeks after the delivery of a watch by DHL I got a bill and some documents from them. I paid  for the watch the MSRP was close to . They just took the MSRP charged  of it plus an admin fee of  so overall  quid. They included the customs declarations from the HRMC that the VAT is paid and the package is clear to proceed. So basically you owe them money for handling this they paid on my behalf. Not every delivery company does that. If thats the case the HRMC will contact you that your package arrived. You will have to pay them the VAT or you will never get your watch.gt As for the EU I just pay the full VAT price thats advertised and thats it?Yes a perk of being a EU member.gt I assume there will be some edge cases too.

307810,0,t1_cfcku8p,So Ill try to stick to the Bauhaus style of watches with the clean face and numbers are a give or take. Thankfully since you want vintage they tend to stick in the range of  mm which should be a perfect fit for your wrist! These vintage watches sometimes have automatic movements so the majority of what i will be suggesting will be mechanical.I stuck mainly to eBay due to its wide selection and the sellers have a visible score of trustworthiness next to their names. I look for gt Some of these come with return policies so that should make you feel more at ease about buying from some. Auctions were unavoidable so dont think you have to bid within the next day just sit back watch and wait. Patience is critical in this situation because of how quickly that price can jump. Also a majority of these watches are from outside of the US so be sure to read through peoples feedback and scrutinize every detail of the watch I did that here but if you do it on your own be sure to google the heck out of everything. That being said onwards to the offeringsGruen they are an old company that died out in the Quartz Crisis around  so the Gruen you see today is not what it once was. They have lots of watch floating around online so the prices have stay relatively low but they are of good quality. I found two Gruen Precisions  amp  with two different movements  and SS respectively. The bands are non factor here because they can be changed out for something more classy than the metal.Omega is still around today and they even have a watch database dedicated to their vintage watches. Their most prominent line back then was the Seamaster so there are lots of those to look at all over the internet. I found two Seamasters  amp  which show some promise Cal  and Cal  Automatic respectively and two Cal.   amp  The only automatic i found was among those and any of those can have their bands swapped for something you would find more stylish. The third one i suggested would probably need a refinishing of the face to clean out the dirt and grime.Zenith is a very nice brand. They are currently well known for their El Primero movement which brings a little more prominence to their vintage watches when they have such a prolific movement now. For you i have found two Calibre  P  amp  a Cal.  Here and a Cal.  HereThere are plenty of other brands out there that I didnt mention which may fit the bill too like Helbros Vulcain and Elgin. Hopefully one of these strikes your fancy but if it doesnt Ill be more than happy to look for you! There are modern brands which may fit the bill to like Junghans so if you feel inclined look at them and see how they fare.Couple side notes about eBay people say youre not just buying the watch but the seller so be sure to check out their feedback and see what people are saying. You can set up reminders on eBay when a watch fits a particular search option you have made it will email you or prompt you on your phone.I hope this helps ,Watches,cfco7k9,1,t5_2qls5

I didnt actually expect much given the price it was only  euros plus shipping but its really surprised me. The strap is extremely soft light and has a lovely pitted texture. Each one is unique. Its also waterproof. Got tons of compliments already.What do you guys think? Would you rock this over a leather strap?My only concern is that I ordered a mm version but its really more like mm theres a slight gap between the lugs. My advice would be to size up to mm and just squeeze it in since its so soft and pliable.

928752,0,t1_ch952vy,Well in defense of design and style I personally think form over function. Aesthetics are more valuable than function in a dress watch. The dress watch is less of a tool than it is a piece of jewelry. Referring to watches being the only widely accepted piece of male jewelry besides things of sentimental value. And in my case the aesthetics of the Edox was the closest that ive seen to my idealaffordable dress watch. Ive searched through many proven quality brands and none of them have really really caught my eye. IE the second Citizen you listed BL was something I really liked for a while but concluded it was too complicatedcluttered for my ideal watch.I have a Gshock that is pretty ugly but its functionality is great. Its much more of a tool than a dress watch can be. In a dress watch I feel I can be more picky in the stylings and I may even prefer quartz because of its accuracy and nonresetting properties.But you bring up a good point about brands that I can definitely understand. I think a cheapy Seiko can beat out many Calvin Kleins or DKNY watches. But I wouldnt say that Edox is on the same level as Calvin Klein because Edox has a long Swiss watchmaking history. I dont think you were saying that though.The first Citizen you posted is quite interesting. I give up the retrograde day but gain hour indicator ecodrive and perpetual calendar. I was confused about how the perpetual calendar worked at first because there was no indication of it but this video showed how it can be set. About  of the way in. I actually like that there is no extra indicators like LY    and  to indicate leap year. Everything is hidden but the functionally is still there. I will definitely have to check this watch out and put it on my list. Its not available on Amazon and its kind of sparse on Ebay.Youve been a big help man thanks.

The details make the difference immaculately applied indices thick and consistent lume screwdown crown on a stem that itself screwed into the case and a bracelet that is as comfortable and deceptively intricate as IWCs original. Every component except for the movement was custom made to spec for this watch even the gently domed singlesided AR sapphire crystal set into the case to prevent popping from pressure differentials.

Buyers want to buy at the lowest price. Sellers want to sell at the highest price.gtother reputable places to buy from? The more reputable the higher the price is bid up. Consumers take the higher price of reputed sellers because the benefit is they dont have to learn to verify the authenticity and condition of the piece themselves. If you want a deal youll have to work for it by researching models and being able to gauge conditionauthenticity.

1214617,0,t3_280s4c, months ago I was in a rush getting ready to go out. Instead of putting on my Nomos Tangente Datum next to my bed like I always do I hastily clasped it to my wrist while walking down the hallway of my apartment. I lost my grip and dropped my watch a gift from my fianc  feet to the hardwood floor. The watch landed flat on its caseback. This is my first mechanical watch and my initial reaction was cringing and thinking I hope I didnt ding the case. When I picked the watch of the floor and saw the second hand had stopped moving my heart sunk. I gave it a tiny wind and a few shakes but the watch wasnt coming back to life.The next day we sent it off for repair to Germany via a local Tourneau shop.  months and  ouch later its finally back on my wrist. Im so happy to have it back and to be able to wear it on my wedding day.I learned a valuable lesson. I have a beautiful timepiece and I need to respect it like I would any jewelry. That means taking it on and off carefully preferably over a soft surface. I also was wearing it as my daily wearer but I may start to take it off when I know Ill be biking to work or doing other physical activities in favor of my hard wearing and scratched up Citizen Eco Drive. Im not so sure about this though. Watches are meant to be worn after all.I also learned that Nomoss service is actually pretty great. One thing I had worried about was the service times of sending a watch all the way to Germany. I thought it would take  months or more. But  months isnt bad at all. And the watch was returned beautifully packaged.,Watches,ci69h7e,9,t5_2qls5

Just food for thought. If you cant fit into the bulova and you can get over the crown sticking out of the  on the seiko that may be your best bet for an every day wear. Also its a lot easier to find a rubberleather strap for a watch than it is to find a steel one. So if your thinking about interchanging straps then this may be your best bet.I dont like the super ultra high tech Casio watches. Some of the eco drives are nice But for me a solar powered radio time set watch takes the fun out of it for me.

The batches produced were so small that I missed out and they recently launched this model just a week ago and being quite inexpensive I pulled the trigger. I went with the white dial because I have only watches with black faces I didnt even think of that before. And the blue hands just look great. The only downside is that it is a quartz movement but since there isnt a seconds hand it dont think of it. The leather band and butterfly clasp feel really good even with my relatively small wrists.

1801878,0,t1_ck6a06b,It most definitely is a factor for judging prestige. Thats why they had the Geneva and Neuchatel observatory challenges. The Swiss just got scared when they realised that Seiko would get greater prestige so they changed the rules so that Seiko couldnt participate anymore and still got slaughtered on the market. Nicolas Hayek had to come up with the ridiculous idea of wearing two watches at once just to keep the Swiss watchmaking industry going. Most of those prestige brands couldnt survive by themselves and were just bought up for the name value.The reason the Swiss try to say timekeeping has nothing to do with it is because with a few exceptions they cant compete in that department but they still make a big deal of having a Chronometer rating with the rather pathetic COSC standards that now pass over  of the watches submitted whereas the original observatory challenges only passed a little over half. A watch is a timekeeper. First you see if it keeps good time then you worry about all the other useless shit.Patek has in house standards that match the old observatory challenges so they get to throw in useless complications just to be fancy  because with them it doesnt compromise accuracy. JLC not quite on the same level but they still have good in house standards. QF used by Chopard Parmigiani and Bovet guarantees reliability accuracy and aesthetics so they get to do fancy stuff just to show off as well. IWC is a bit of a fringe case in some ways their standards are better than COSC in others worse and they dont do in house movements but insisting that a watch doesnt run slow is a standard thats worth something. Omegas at least pushing mechanical time keeping forward with the Coaxial movement. Everything else might as well be a Chinese watch.,Watches,ck6a3m3,3,t5_2qls5

1860355,0,t3_2fwbqz,Well your typical automatic movement has a power reserve of  hours with a little variance. What that means is when it is fully charged that is how long it will keep it self powered off your wrist. If the watch was dying with being off your wrist for only  hrs then it wasnt fully charged. Are you wearing it all day and are you fairly active or inactive desk job? Because if you put it on first thing in the morning and are moving around a normal amount it should reach full charge before the end of the day probably even before noon.So basically you just need to wear it every day get a watch winder for the days you arent wearing it or you can reset it every time you put it on when not wearing it for a few days. If you decide to buy a winder make sure to shop around and know what speeddirection your watch needs. My guess would be that a low end Seiko movement like what is in the SKX is probably something like  rotations and is unidirectional no clue which direction. So dont just buy the first cheap winder you see because it may not keep it wound.,Watches,ckdd8lw,1,t5_2qls5

1879473,0,t3_2g433o,Guy from Zurich here.Theres two types of watches which I know of which are specific to Zurich. Keep in mind that Basel and Geneva are the big watch cities in Switzerland.One is the Max Affolter Watch Shop. They have their own models cost  CHF. They are cheap quartz watches which look almost exactly like Jowissa watches also a quartz brand which sells swiss watches to tourists. The Jowissas are about  CHF. So you get a real bargain there if you show off a little and say this is specific to Zurich  Here is their homepage.The other is more to your style. A local wathmaker maybe in his forties in the historic central part of Zurich buys sells repairs and builds watches. Here is his page. He has about  of his own watches. They are mechanical movements either ETA or Zeno. With some cases dials etc. he assembles them himself. They are about k CHF. That is probably the stuff you want.There is also the Zurich Partime which has won a design award and can be bought at almost any airport in the world. The Swiss partime with the swiss cross telling the time looks like some art student on crack designed it at am. They are both thick as a GShock.There are also some used watch sellers in Zurich. I cannot recommend the one at Bellevue station at the tip of the lake. His shop is called Greenwich Time or something. He just isnt my type. Seemed kind of smug and will never touch a watch from a jap or russian. But maybe this is just my impression. There is also a watch dealer at Haldenbach station. He seemed kind of nice also has lots of Wall watches and oldschool table watches.There may be other stuff in Zurich which I am not aware of. Hope that helps.,Watches,ckfo468,3,t5_2qls5

Chances are you that you should make your own decision after trying the watch out.  If thats the style that youve decided on dont let rwatches stop you from getting the watch you want.  Were a double edged sword we have great knowledge but absolutely have tons of biases and group think sometimes I think I actually joined a sub that is a giant circle jerk.  End of the rant for me is this  If yous the watch that you like then dont let anyone stop you from getting it and enjoying it... I have Fossils that I love as much much better watches in my collection.As for Jomashop its always seemed reliable to me I wouldnt hesitate to buy from there.

I also have trouble believing a watch from the s looks that clean too.  The price for the watch also seems a bit off.

1955320,0,t3_2h1z7l,The ratchet wheel lifting up is a result of the blue screw holding it down backing out slightly the arbor the wheel sits on is keyed to be square so its come out of alignment and isnt seated properly which is allowing everything to just slip and not wind correctly. Simple fix to remove and reset it the back of the watch just needs to be opened the screw removed wheel placed correctly and the screw tightening back down while holding the wheel in place. The trouble is this is an inexpensive Chinese watch probably only worth the  labor most shops would charge to do this. For many shops they simply choose not to work on these types of watches as its fairly common for them to have issues like this and once they agree to do a quick fix on one thing the customer would them assume theyre willing to do anything else it may need or even hold them responsible for further issues with the watch even if theyre entirely not related. ,Watches,ckoti48,2,t5_2qls5

What a few folks have been trying to point to is the double standard andor faulty logic being used to admonish Rodina and allow the Nomos copyfor whatever reasonto receive full legitimation.Nomos deserves a full hearty and wonderful congratulations that they can and do make a breadth of other models. The swing system looks fantastic. That as a point of fact does not make their copy of the Lange any better. It means they do their own things and copy others. Great.I get it you own a Nomos Tagente and youre convinced it is without fault. This is the same overly defensive move of several other folks on this thread. You didnt buy one of the other more original designsyou bought the copy.No one especially not me has ever said there is something deplorable with this copy AT ALL!

We take it back again a month later I get the call the watch is ready. The watch is picked up. It now runs almost as well as it did when it first went in for a service.

2243525,0,t3_2cvtyg,Seiko makes excellent dive watches. With due respect to Swiss watch owners Seiko makes watches that real divers want to take down with them. Other than that and obviously the Grand Seikos Seiko make a lot of aesthetic blunders with some truly ugly watches but these series are really quite handsome. Im something of a Seikophile myself and own the SARB SARG SARG and SARX as well as some other Seiko automatics in my collection. The SARB is generally considered the baby GS because of styling cues taken from big brother. SARBs have been around for a while as Seikos midrange automaticmechanical with classic styling. They are generally around mm in diameter which is now considered small. The SARG and SARX ranges were introduced early  with larger modern case sizes generally around mm with the SARG and  series introduced later in . None have screw down crowns all have sapphire crystals but no AR and all use the same Rc movement with hacking and handwinding and is Seikos midrange movement with date but no additional complications such as chronographstopwatch moonphase power reserve indicator etc etc.. This movement is officially rated as  to  secday but by all accounts they generally perform much better than these modest figures and all four of mine fall within  seconds a day. All were designed for the Japan Domestic Market JDM and not available elsewhere. Just why Seiko has chosen NOT to market these models worldwide is a mystery but for me its a positive and a big part of the attraction of these watches. All models share similar Seiko midrange quality and what another commentator said is basically correct it boils down to stylingtheme. SARG has outdoorexplorermilitary looks see Hamilton Khaki or Tudor Ranger while the SARX has traditional manly looks with sporty overtones suitable to bring to meet your clients in the office. Actually if you look very closely you will find that  both the SARG and SARX ranges share a kind of gene pool and heritage with various earlier SARB models some of which have been discontinued.  The original SARBs have the small and subtle sizes that seem to work best for formal occasions. If I was pressed to say out of these the SARX wins as my allaround favorite with its good modern size versatile styling and superb quality finishes but thats just me. The SARG cases and dial are just a little less expensively finished and reflects this in its pricing by being roughly USD cheaper than the SARX.One of the things about Seiko is you know what you are paying for that is the watch and not for some celebrity to get on a flight to another holiday. Having said that there are a lot of nice midpriced Swiss watches out there Victorinox Hamilton Mido Certina to name just a few. Mostly use the Swiss ETA  or equivalent Selitta movement which is also very well respected but expect to pay between  more for similar quality depending on the brand.JDM Seikos are available from various internet sellers try to get one who is actually based in Japan. If you do decide to buy make sure to have your trash canrubbish bin handy because I guarantee you will hardly be able to wait to get that cheap Seiko box out of your sight. If you go leather be similarly prepared with an alternative strap handy. Their steel bands are OK but only just. You will know then that your money has mostly gone into the watch. ,Watches,clp06ot,1,t5_2qls5

2267578,0,t1_clrzk4b,ALS watches dont hold their values all that well especially compared with PP.  From an article on HodinkeeLange is indeed mediating the issue of their resale values and in the cases of the pieces mentioned above they have much to be proud of.  Still there is a ways to go if Lange is to consistently sell well in the aftermarket but that simply means there is tremendous value in some of the earlier Lange watches right now.  For example say you are the average Greenwich Connecticutdwelling man of some means and you walk into the wonderful Betteridge Jewelers to look at this years Datograph UPDOWN.  You are told the price of this watch is  in platinum. Then out of the corner of your eye you see a watch that looks almost the same as the new Datograph youve just been shown but its at the PreOwned counter.  In fact it is a Datograph the earlier mm version with shorter power reserve and you ask how much it is.  The sales person tells you .  Thats a difference of  between the original Datograph preowned and the new Datograph UPDOWN brand new. That dear readers is a big difference and here in lies the beauty and value of what Lange is a superior watch manufacture making truly exceptional products and what Lange isnt known by watch buyers en mass meaning there are truly tremendous deals to be had before Lange becomes a known entity to all serious watch buyers.   There will be a market correction for some of these great watches from Lange and I can promise you you will be thinking back to this day when you could buy these watches for what you can currently and say damn i should have bought it back then.  Lange has an indisputably bright future and the fact that they are already paying attention to their own collectors market means it will be managed very carefully.In the past Lange has shown mediocre second hand resale value. Many products lost  of their original retail value and quickly which made it an excellent candidate for a nd hand purchase compared to other top highend brands. But this window of opportunity is rapidly closing. William Rohr Consultant Bonhams NY,Watches,clrzqil,3,t5_2qls5

2323527,0,t3_2lwvj0,So my grandfather gave me this watch about  years ago shortly before he passed away. He was a watch collector as well as carplane collector and had quite nice taste. The watch is cool but not really my style and Im not overly sentimental.  I ask about value because Ive never quite been able to find out anything about it and I certainly havent seen many of them. Im pretty interested in selling the watch as I continue to fund my startup. My grandfather was an entrepreneur as well and I can justify the sale of it by trying to build something more meaningful to me. I think he would appreciate that.  Anyway if nothing else thanks for looking at my watch! EDIT  I knew rwatches would come through. I really appreciate all the feedback and I definitely dont mind the real talk. Im definitely not rich and my startup does not depend on  grand. Now if it was K and thats K less I have to take from the bank then I would be okay with that.  Glad to learn a little bit more about Blancpain here and the watch in general. Ill have to reconcile my own personal feelings on my own but it really is great to hear about what real watch enthusiasts think about it and have taught me so for that rwatches many many thanks.  Maybe Ill keep it and give it to my son whens hes old enough and hopefully by then big gold bracelets are more his style than his old man. Thanks!,Watches,clywgxj,13,t5_2qls5

2328521,0,t3_2lza2l,I dont think thats true in many cases. For instance I dont want my colleagues to know if I spent more than a couple hundreds on a watch. Because its badly seen to do so. In the same way that I wouldnt tell them the price of my jacket if I paid more than a usual price for it.Thats one of the reasons why I wouldnt buy a Rolex. Too obviously expensive people know it. Unless youre obviously rich people will see it as either a fake or a showoff.The point is to wear nice looking objects both for us and for the general image they give. You dont wear an expensive jacket to look like its expensive you wear it to look good. In general.And of course thats only the public image aspect. You need to add the personal satisfaction to havewear an object you like. To be pleasured with it every time you look at the hour. Its pretty materialistic of course.,Watches,clzinxk,9,t5_2qls5

2452939,0,t1_cmelb2y,Ive heard this too.  Do you happen to know if there are any released numbers on maintenance issues etc?  Id be interested to see if so.I have a C Planet Ocean which I bought new from an AD in  and its been one of my most accurate watches. I havent sent it in for maintenance and it occasionally sits idle for a week or so at a a time as part of the rotation  yet whenever Ive used it its been problemfree.  I understand YMMV and maybe I just got lucky which is why Id be interested to see if Omega or anyone else has released any info on the s.To the OP The  series is a modified ETA A on which Omega added a freesprung balance and the Coaxial escapement.  The first two iterations A and B had issues having to do with the lubricant and the beat frequency both of which were fixed for C.  The D uses a trilevel coaxial escapement rather than the bilevel used by the C.  It is a coaxial the way George Daniels originally designed it and the mechanism is similar to the current based movements minus the Silicon hairspring.  Based on my experience the C has been problemfree.  Ive read that the D addressed whatever issues a few of the C had and Ive not heard of any systematic problems with any Planet Oceans with the D movement.  Personally I was going to get an based PO when they came out but it was significantly more expensive and also thicker so I kept my C PO and havent had any regrets.Edit  ETA A not A,Watches,cmevx4a,1,t5_2qls5

Both Es and EMs are usually ragged out and even more so as the cost gets lower and lower on the Ms.  Vanos isnt a problem really as long as its checked out before or if it has been rebuilt. And but problem right now with Es is that theyre way too damn expensive.My advice for you would be to keep the cash and find the right vehicle.  EM dwarfs the E in almost every aspect and many would consider the EM the best car that has ever come out of Munich.  Find a clean E for a decent price and amazing maintenance records?  Go for it.  Throw back novelty is worth it itself I think.  But DO NOT buy an EM for the sake of having one now.

The day can be enlarged and put at the six oclock position.  As a refreshing design nudge you might think of changing the background of the day and date to black and put the numbersletters in bold red or a red background and black characters.  The second hand might be black or red to match.Think about rounding the bezel and making it just a bit larger.  Im thinking of the Raymond Weil Tradition mens watches.  But if you do this I think you are moving away from your ultraclean geometric vibe.Is the crown screwdown?  Its a wonderful touch even on  ATM casesmy ESQ Evo watch by Movado has one and imparts a nice feeling of robustness amp manufacturing detail.I really like the AR coating but make sure the watch face takes advantage of the increased amount of light let throughtake advantage of a brighter better lit watch face.

I think Kickstarter is an excellent way to fund something like that as it removes the risk and I may go that route in the future. I really do appreciate the feedback though. I dont tie my emotional state to my work so I dont get offended if there is criticism. Id much rather get feedback like yours at this stage rather than after going through with a production run.

A lot of watch enthusiasts like Orient because they developed and use Orient specific movements. Despite now being owned by Seiko Orient doesnt use Seiko mechanical at least movements in their watches. Now does that matter? It depends on the person in my case obviously yes haha.

3261752,0,t3_2xhblk,Hi rWatchesI am very new to the higher end watch scene. I have been lurking for a while and I figured it was time to spend some money on a nicer watch than a knife. If any of you are also knife guys and frequent rknifeclub  you may know who I am. I have spent quite a long time drooling over knives and watches and knives took over. I decided it was time to straighten out my EDC Collection so to speak. So here is my new watch a Citizen EcoDrive Endeavor. With my spending habits on  blades I figured I should try and somewhat match it without going balls out and buying an Omega or a Breitling without first knowing what I truly need in a watch. This watch has a rotating bezel a chronograph second hand and hr face. I love it dearly already.My style has been a little more athletic but Ive already caught the bug and have been looking into getting a leather banded watch if any of you have some ideas let me know!Also any constructive criticism or comments are very helpful and if you have any question please feel free to ask me!I hope this fits within the Bots requirements and I hope you all enjoy!

The crystal is made out of plastic and can be polished.  Also I that crown looks like it may be a replacement not certain.  Check ebay for k values probably between .

3275992,0,t3_2xnjnq,This is my first of hopefully many simple watches. I have been looking for a watch for awhile know and my girlfriend noticed and bought it for me for our  month anniversary. I couldnt be happier because it is simple classy and goes with just about everything I own. I have never been a big fan of big flashy watches so this fit my style perfectly. If anyone is looking for a nice watch that doesnt want anything flashy this is the watch for you. It is silent and seems to stay accurate. The front of the watch seems to be a rubbery glass texture but it is about  so I was not expecting anything extravagant. The only down side to this watch is the short armband and after only a week of wearing it the band is started to scuff and show a worn color. I cant complain because its an extremely thoughtful gift and I do think it is perfect for my style. I cant wait till I have some extra money so I can expand my collection.

The quote below is probably one of the most interesting arguments Ive heard or the best articulated gt ...Most of todays Google Android Wearbased devices look like facsimiles of a watch but not something a serious watch lover would ever consider as nice. The Apple Watch feels like a genuine modern manifestation of the watch complete with quality materials and a very pleasant ergonomic and tactile experience. It is a watch product that would have naturally come about if the traditional watch industry continued to modernize and develop after the quartz watch became the status quo. After putting the traditional watch industry in a bad place Apple has now come to the rescue of the watch truly bringing in to the st century... I know many people here will never own one potentially myself included but this article made me see the potential the Apple Watch has and why it may deserve a spot in my watch box in the future.,Watches,cpbj38u,5,t5_2qls5

I havent kept track of how many secondsminutes it gains or loses pday etc its something I might do at some point but in all honestly Im not running a train station so I dont need it to be super accurate. I do know it does gain a few seconds however because I have a few watches to compare against. Ive also clanged it against the odd door frames and the stainless casing has scuffed ever so slightly but thats life. I also want to slip in a thanks to this entire group because without it Id never have known about this brand.

Then I just plotted in Excel.I do believe there are apps that take a photo using the phone camera processes the clock hands and then compares it to the timestamp on the photo.

I had no interest in watches perse but I loved wearing my watch because of sentimental value... and sure getting a few complements was nice  I wont deny that! Even still  I just wanted that Armani watch because I thought Armani was just cool.I had no perception of price of watches this is not my ignorance  I just didnt. Similarly to how if you ask someone who knows nothing about photography how much Nikon DSLRs go for they wouldnt have a clue. I had no idea how much any watches cost. My little teenage brain very impulsive and impressionable just had it engraved that big fashion brands were cool and automatically expensive.Your phone comment is really spoton  pretty much everyone from age  and up has a  phone. This has just become the norm really  or at least in the West. A lot of people especially at young age lose or break these phones  if they are fortunate enough to get a replacement  that is  gone. That is not a small amount of money  but we do not see it as ostentatious.

That said the redial job looks OK and I dont think people care so much about originality with these old Bulovas. The only thing off about it is the Extra Fancy or whatever it says above the seconds dial. That almost certainly wasnt originally there. Actually looking more now it might even be both a redial and a mismatched case with a replacement crown in the incorrect style.

The little details may be different slightly but the most easily noticeable parts are almost exact. Start with the bezel and working inwards we have a different style bezel than typical speed masters. Instead of the black inlay it carries over the material used in the case same as a daytona. Then we have a border around the dial that is black with red indices same as the Paul Newman Daytona. Then we have a white dial with black sub dials  same as the Paul Newman. On top we have the branding and symbol same placement for both as well as the description of the watch and its model name right underneath the brand name.

3523419,0,t1_cptspm3,There is probably not a general consensus about quartz or mechanical.  There are many fine quartz watches and more than a few crappy mechanicals.Quartz is more accurate over time but requires batteries and has the distinct ticking movement of the second hand with some exceptions.Mechanical either automatic or handwound will typically lose or gain anywhere from  to  seconds per day.  But people love them for the many personal and qualitative reasons e.g. the smooth movement of the second hand the history of watchmaking exclusivity the expectation of a higher level of craftsmanship longer lifetime for the watch etc..  In this sub you will find people with small and large collections of watches with some that only get worn occasionally.  In this case having mechanicals means you dont have quartz watches running down their batteries as they sit in a box. You can strap on your watch of choice for the day set the time give it a few winds and youre good to go.  Mechanicals are more work but thats part of the allure for some people.  The daily routine of selecting setting and winding a watch is as much a part of the morning as getting dressed and having a cup of coffee.  In your place I wouldnt obsess over the quartz vs mechanical question.  Hes got an automatic mechanical already so hes probably just fine with that vs. a quartz.,Watches,cptw8go,2,t5_2qls5

Orient also recently launched a new GMT model in the Orient star line. Much cleaner aesthetic and smaller case. The model number escapes me but you can find it on the Orient Japan website.

Considering almost all common forms of soldering done in jewelry work use torches burning a gas and using oxygen no not really. Theres going to be oxygen in the environment and it will cause oxidation to the metal. Surface preparation of the metal as well as cleanup afterwards will also necessitate some refinishing work.

3805143,0,t1_cqq0chx,Im not surprised. Id also never dream of sending a watch to Omega for a service unless there were absolutely no other places that could do it for me. I have heard of instances where people send their watches to an Omega service centre and end up with non original parts cases with different serial no. imperfections etc. This is not to say that this will happen to you I have seen watches come out of an omega service looking spectacular compared to how they went in.I have a local watch maker who is very reliable and who I trust to do what needs to be done and would generally suggest people do the same. Its much easier to get exactly what you want when you are speaking face to face with the person who does the work and generally works out to be cheaper.,Watches,cqq0m6r,1,t5_2qls5
3805498,0,t3_33vxtx,Forgive me as Im new here.   But I dont quite get it  the face of this watch is not particularly elegant or distinguishedlooking.   I would even say from my naive perspective that it looks clunky and something my parents would have given me as a first throwaway watch that wouldnt be a huge loss if it were broken.

3825492,0,t1_cqsbxzf,While I do understand that Buddhism supports those as religious values sometimes religion affects culture in ways that lead to one identifying as a Buddhist from a different perspective. The different sects of Buddhism have various foci as different forms of ChristianityJudaismIslam etc have various sects. The integration of those religions into society can be seen even in people who are not particularly religious.

From a practical standpoint diving watches tend to be built more durably than most other mechanical watches. Also they are versatile from a fashion standpoint as a diving watch can be paired with everything from shorts and a tshirt to three piece suits. Also. The Rolex Submariner is a diving watch and the Rolex Submariner is literally what comes to  of peoples mind when they think of the words nice watch. James bond wears diving watches and he is literally the definition of badass and if you wear a diving watch if you get really really lucky some of his badassery may rub off on you. ,Watches,crdetmw,3,t5_2qls5

Youre leaving it up to the seller to be legitimate.Wire transfers are one way transactions no question about it. You have no recourse if things go wrong.But I would add a caveat to that. Many sellers in Europe especially Germany deal exclusively with wire transfers. Once you get into the k figure bracket its just a method of payment that makes sense to use with very trusted sellers. Again you need to be careful vet the seller and make sure you are dealing with a legitimate business but I have never had a problem with wire transfers even  figure ones.

The longer you let it sit with that much moisture inside the more rust the movement will develop and the more expensive the repair will be. If you can get it into a larger bag with some big desiccant packets that would help hold you over I dont recommend rice because it can dust that can get inside the watch which is obviously bad as well but in dire circumstances it can help as long as you arent completely covering the watch in the rice.  ,Watches,crr6n9t,11,t5_2qls5

4180868,0,t3_38mt90,TAG Louis Vuitton Heuer  Ed Heuer. The vintages are goat the new are below par quality for an above par price. I agree with most of OP except for the vintage Rolex part. Though I agree the prices are getting ridiculous but thats a snob thing everyone knows Rolex so its easy recognition so why vintage? Because anyone can buy a new fifteen in a dozen sub instore but the vintages all have their unique traits. So its basically a way for the owners to feel better than other new Rolex owners. Same thing as to why Americans all feel the need to modify their supersportscars because if just anyone can buy the same car as you then youre not better than them. The true Murikancommercialist spirit isnt to be adequate it isnt just to keep up with the Joneses its to be better than the Joneses. That being said Im a huge vintage whore simply because I feel that those watches have a more authentic feel to them. Nowadays a lot of modern watches look too plastique. Furthermore when buying vintage you dont leave  of the valueprice paid at the store. Purchase versus resale value. What I dont get is socalled homages that are straight copies of a watch but with a different name. What I dont get is people wearing wall clocks on their wrists. Especially if the lugs extend your wrist. What I dont get is the AP ROO offshores especially the limited editions. Theyre usually so hideous they can even make blind people cry. Actually I do get it.

4207634,0,t3_392t5c,Hi everyone this is only my second mechanical watch.  Interestingly enough I purchased my first one only a month or so ago to have a decent looking watch to wear in my wedding.  Strapped on cash having a wedding coming up and all I got myself a Seiko  with a silver face and added a brown synthetic strap.  My fiance pretended to be indifferent to it but unbeknownst to me she had already purchased the watch I show to now.  Its a Citizen Signature Grand Classic on a black crocodile strap with deployment clasp which she left for me gift wrapped at home to open on the morning of our wedding.  I love every detail of it!  Im writing to you from my honeymoon in Antigua.. I choose to leave it at home as I worried about the sand and salt water but now I miss it and regret not bringing it along.  I know you its not much compared to the many watches you see here but I hope you enjoy the pics as much as I enjoy the piece!,Watches,crzuwsu,17,t5_2qls5

Its a little smaller at mm  choose your movement from the drop down under the pictureChristopher Ward also makes a  watch at mm but it might be a little dressier than youre looking for.

The square face of the Timex created a mold of itself at the top of his wrist.So yeah. Just thought I could share a horror photo.

4625005,0,t3_3eceof,More picsIve always been fascinated by analog and mechanical things. I guess that is a defense mechanism that stems from being born in this digital age where even your toothbrush has a microchip in it. I love vinyl records oldfashioned carburated engines relics of a past age. The newest obsession of mine seem to be mechanical watches and I dove into the subject quite cautiously by purchasing this  Vostok Komandirskie.After a couple of days of not being able to decide which dial amp case design to go with I settled with the  a watch with a practical dial and a compass bezel. The watch is not selfwinding and isnt quite water resistant as the Amphibia but I dont intend taking it swimming anyway. The watch stays wound for a day and a half on  winds of the crown and the instruction manual suggests not to wind it more than  times from an unwound state.The only part where you notice the price of the watch is as with all Vostoks the strap. It isnt that terrible its very usable indeed but you will eventually want to replace it as it is made from an artificial material which smells quite potently of Chinese plastic and isnt terribly comfortable on the wrist. Ive already ordered a nylon strap for it.All in all this is a fantastic purchase for the price and I will definitely get more Vostok watches for my collection.,Watches,ctdjzv4,3,t5_2qls5

Youre spending a lot of money and a lot of people will advise you to get something else and im gonna be one of them. But let me explain why.For . you can get a hell of a watch. A watch thats not Quartz and that will last you a hell of a long time. Take a look at Longines take a look at Baume et Mercier Tag Heuer. These are brands with a history of watchmaking and these are brands that have stood the test of time. Youre getting a lot more quality for your buck from them even if you buy Quartz. Google Jomashop and see about buying from there you wont get manufacturer warranties but youll save a significant amount of cash.That being said if thats what you want God bless and God speed. Keep an eye on Ebay im sure youll see it drop in price at some point. ,Watches,ctksv55,3,t5_2qls5

4699613,0,t1_ctmrcvm,I wouldnt say theyre made from low cost parts. They use ETA movements yes but thats completely in line with their brand identity. BampR use the most accurate mechanics ETA movements often are. That being said dig into the Space  or the the Hydro Challenger. Both are impressive pieces of horological tech. The Hydro Challenger is a dive watch that holds the world record for depth   meters due to a liquid silicon filled case. Under those conditions a quartz movement is the most reliable. So they use it. Kinda crazy. The space s tcrown system is equally impressive. They own the patent for both of those. Lastly they also own a patent for a water resistance indicator that can also absorb humidity that could damage the movement. Basically they make accurate under any condition watches and go to some pretty great lengths to guarantee that. And if you want to go up in price yeah sure theyll make everything out of gold and stick a turbillion in it.,Watches,ctmxbqn,1,t5_2qls5

4734843,0,t3_3frz70,As promised earlier on the WristCheck thread I have some more pictures to share of my new Omega  but first a bit more of the story. The watch is a joint present from my grandparents and parents plus a contribution from me for my graduating college this past May and their goal was for us to pick out a watch that I would never outgrow or otherwise want to replace. I think they definitely succeeded on that front  its possible that one day if Im very very successful I could have another really nice watch that maybe costs a comparable amount. But between my love of the Omega brand and the coolness of combining the moonwatch with a moonphase this would be pretty tough to beat  and Im so fortunate to now get to own it.Other watches I considered were the Longines Master TripleDate Moonphase Tudor Black Bay Red and the Longines Master Retrograde Moonphase In the end however I decided that at that pricepoint I wanted something more complicateddynamic than the Tudor which is a beautiful threehander but a pricy threehander and that I didnt need all the complexity of the Longines relative to the cleanness of the Omega. Also this picture that I found definitely sold me.Now to some photography stuff Whats a good way to take a picture of a watchs movement? I attempted to for this album but it was hard to get a good shot with the bracelet in the way. Also any tips on photographing a moonphase? Anything with a flash seems to make mine virtually invisible so I imagine that isnt the right technique!,Watches,ctrdbdf,16,t5_2qls5

4885200,0,t3_3hskwl,What kind of accuracy do you need?  Note that mechanical watches arent going to be anywhere near as accurate as quartz ones.  Even the COSCcertified mechanical watches are only guaranteed to be within  seconds a day which is roughly  minutesmonth.  Its not unusual for regular nonCOSC watches to be within  secondsday which is like  minutesmonth.Now a given watch will likely have better numbers as these are just about worsecase examples.  However a mechanical watch is going to be nowhere near as accurate as a quartz one which are often accurate to seconds a month and the atomicgps watches should be within a tiny fraction of a second  always  as long the watch manages to synchronize daily.,Watches,cuabgkx,3,t5_2qls5

This latest purchase likely soon to be eclipsed by the new limited edition blue Sinn  chrono is my latest obsession.  The LE Nomos Club for timeless luxury outside of Dallas Texas.This watch is phenomenal.  The power reserve on the handwind is really the only drawback I have come to accept.  The dial is clearly its greatest asset and the inhouse caliber with the Nomos swing system is a cool addition.

Even though I know that being Chinese made isnt bad it always bothers me and I love when I have a product made by some small nation and you know it isnt the byproduct of spontaneous industry with cheap labor but rather hard work.

The face is simple yet functional with a date complication and a power reserve. Its easy to read too because of the contrast of blue and white.This model with the blue hands only comes with a steel bracelet which Im not a fan of. I got a blue leather strap to compliment the blue hands and I think it works pretty well. If you guys want more information on this watch heres a link to the official website with specifications.

It is smaller than the Professional at mm and has an automatic ETA A movement with a Dubois Dupraz module aka the Omega . It has a domed hesalite crystal and a nice bracelet but still pulls at my arm hairs. You can differentiate a Reduced from a Pro by the dial. There are minute markers and the chronograph subdials are pushed to the edges. I cant comment on the accuracy thus far since I just received it. I may also look into getting a nice leather strap for it in the future.

Smaller form factor requirement. Also Pateks is much nicer to look at.Are either of these watches worth their price?

I apologize for the blurry photos  my phones camera isnt what it used to be.Pictured are Junghans Max Bill Chronoscope Junghans Chronoscope Sinn  St Be Sinn  Sinn  A Sa B Sinn  St Hanhart MK II Junghans Telemeter BlackThe Sinn  has been near the top of my wish list for a while and I was not disappointed.  At mm I loved the way it felt on my wrist.  The real downside was turning the interior bezel was not easy at all.  Maybe this is something that will loosen up over time.The Sinn  and the Hanhart MK II really caught me off guard.  Id seen both online but they are way more beautiful in person.  The Hanharts bezel almost glided and I just could not stop admiring the Sinn s face through the domed crystal.My biggest surprise was the Junghans Telemeter Black.  Ive never seen this watch online or otherwise and it floored me.  The bracelet was very solid and comfortable much better than Sinns metal bracelets in my opinion.

I agree with you that they wear at least two mms larger than stated. I have an almost  wrist and its very large on my wrist. Ive never been able to size it correctly either but I wear mine a bit loose. You may want to inquire if they sell half links like Patek. Yes APs like Pateks are extremely scratchprone. It used to bother me and then now Ive come to accept it but I still take off my watch or wear a Rolex if Im going to be doing something where I know it will be scratched.

This has a seconds subdial and a  hour dial thats just hooked into the hour hand note that its  on the main dial and the subdial.

Im looking to get a Hamilton Pioneer Auto mm for a dressdaily and possibly a Kemmner Skellet as a fancy conversational piece but for the time being I have this guy to photograph.Picked up on eBay for  I think. Its done a great job since ownership... One of the problems with this solar model is the panels sometimes lose conection to the battery and it causes it to shut down and reboot. Being off eBay Casio wouldnt warranty it even with a serial number... a couple screws later and a set of pliers I had the contacts fixed for free and its been running true ever since fingers crossed.

Though its a pretty subtle looking watch Ive gotten multiple compliments on it in the two weeks Ive had it.  I will say that it is a bit heavy on the wrist given the size though I personally like a bigger watch.  I might switch it to a metal bracelet theres a model that comes with it for comfort and because its a bit difficult to take on and off and I sometimes think the black dial version might be a bit cooler looking.

5365170,0,t3_3oi6vm,First of Im a novice and dont know a lot about watches compared to others on this forum Im sure.  But I will give you advice that I would give a friend and you are free to discard it.First of I would try and obtain a mechanical watch rather than a quartz.  I personally feel that there is more craftsmanship with a mechanical watch however to be honest as far as I know they are all made in big factorys unless you go to a specific watchmaker.  However this would be my preference.Secondly there are many reasons to buy a watch. If you are looking at a watch as an investment which it can be and kind of how I look at watches these days even if this investment is small then none of these watches fit that mould.  What I would say to my friend is that they maybe want to look at getting a secondhand Steinhart for this money on eBay which I think is most likely possible.  Not only will they obtain a mechanical watch which is a plus in my opinion they may actually have a watch which will retain its value with inflation most likely  years down the line though I could be completely wrong!,Watches,cvxgm3x,1,t5_2qls5

5372505,0,t3_3ojpfn,My  laptop has done more for me than my Speedmaster ever will. It got me through my university education gave me hours of entertainment on long trips served as a means to video chat with family all over the country and perhaps most importantly at least for this discussion allowed me to learn and create things that earned me enough money to be able to comfortably purchase a new Speedmaster as a present to myself when finishing college.I dont think you can really compare the value of these two things. Justifications like this are actually kind of dangerous when making financial decisions of larger consequence.I would say buy it if you really want to  they keep their value quite well and you can always sell it if you need the money  but avoid making these sort of justifications when dropping this kind of money on a something like a watch. Being smart now will result in many fine watches in the future ,Watches,cvyec9n,2,t5_2qls5
5372644,0,t3_3om7m7,I purchased this watch in the summer off of chrono. Its the previous gen Overseas. I went with the previous gen because of the smaller mm case which I think fits my smaller wrist a lot better. I also think it looks better although I much prefer the bracelet of the newer models.As soon as it arrived I took it into the VC boutique on Madison Ave to have it serviced.  months later I get an email saying my watch service is finally complete. I went in last Saturday and pick it up and was pleasantly surprised by how good it looked. It was like a completely different watch. The pushers are buttery smooth as youd expect from a watch of this caliber. The seconds hand on the chrono is super smooth with no jumps.What I especially like about this watch is that it is M WR. I can go swimming or just take a shower with it on to clean it without having to worry about damaging the movement.It doesnt have the antimagnetic feature that the newer ones have but because of that its also super slim for a chrono at only about .mm thickness. Compare that to my other chronos that range from mm in thickness.All in all great watch and great work from VC in putting it in brandnew condition although for the money I paid to service it I could have purchased a new Omega.,Watches,cvyezan,1,t5_2qls5

I said Gray but it cant be a tropical Milgauss. He smiled and said It is. And nobody Ive contacted has ever seen one like it.Recently a woman came in to his shop and said that she wanted to replace the watchs dial to get it back to its original black. She said she was unable to sell it on eBay with this gray color. The watchmaker told her hed buy it for what she was asking. He has since gone through it thoroughly. Its all original and all the seals and gaskets are good.We theorized as to how this happened to the dial how the seconds hand got rust spots and how nobody has seen a Milgauss like this. But who knows. Heat? UV? Moisture seems likely but the dial has no spots and is almost evenly gray. You can see that its darker at the very edges and that theres a slightly lighter gray band near the hash marks.Ever seen a watch like this?

Of course I was very tempted too well it is a rolex. but I refused.  He got his own first rolex from his dad when he got promoted to VP in his company. And I want to be able to say I made it. before accepting such a nice watch.  Which brings me to my seiko. Since I was moving to Japan this was one of the first things I got after getting settled in. At that time I was ready to shell out around usd for a nice watch but reading lots of online reviews most collection shots showed an iteration of this workhorse in the background.  Its kinda big heavy dirt cheap and unremarkably common. But its been down m under with me in okinawa up masl in Fuji accidentally got splashed with some sulfuric acid at work. but whatever I throw at it it just keeps ticking.It has literally been through everything with me these past few years and despite its shortcomings it has been a faithful companion and keeps good time.Until the day Ill be able to accept my dads watch I cant recommend this watch enough for the first time buyer an enthusiast or even a hardcore collector. ,Watches,cw73hqj,0,t5_2qls5

5517531,0,t1_cwgb0xy,I assume you are from Australia given your post above. I hope you realize this also applies to Australia but just with different values........anything over  shipped into Australia will have  GST added. UK has a higher tax rate on goods than Australia  that is just something people have to live with. Being taxed as per the rules is not getting screwed........taxes are part of life.The tax is added to  protect locally sold andor manufactured goods  as a revenue for the government and  to equalize similar taxes being applied on all goods in the country. And sometimes the total price is set by large companies in each country to effectively equalize across markets.It also seems from the UK government website unless I am reading it wrong that OP would have only paid . on this watch  due to its low value on the table.But the bonus is that if you keep updated with country taxes and tourist taxback schemes as well as exchange rates you can literally find the cheapest place in the world to buy your watch!!!! For example with the USD being stronger than the AUD at the moment and the fact that tourists to Australia get  taxback OFF the listed price on purchases whereas USA have to add  ONTO the listed price of the watch a Rolex datejust can be had in Australia for  less USD than purchasing in USA.Hope this didnt come off too aggressive but there are rules in many countries.

The average of the two would be zero where the average is what would be the net field imparted onto the watch.

5595661,0,t1_cwq42fs,Youre right it doesnt remotely explain it and Id never have guessed the truth but the jackass above you incited me to RTFM so I just wasted the last five minutes looking for it.gt Rolex achieved perfection when it turned its attention to redefining the purpose and functionalitygt of the bezel. Typically a bezel operates independently from the internal mechanism howevergt the Ring Command bezel in the YachtMaster II regatta chronograph operates in conjunctiongt with it. As a mechanical component linked to the movement the bezel literally acts as the key togt the programmable countdown allowing it to be set and synchronised to the sequence of racegt start times. Complex in design but simple in use it is functionally beautiful.,Watches,cwqp09f,1,t5_2qls5

After more than a year of waiting and learning about the Zenith and its history here I had a change of heart. El Premiro it was! I did some GoogleFu went to the AD and I found that the standard one was too.. colorful. However the one with the Power Reserve had a much more uniform face and with the open heart.. I knew that was the one for me. But decided to sleep on it. Fast forward two weeks later and they had a sale at the AD in the duty free. Seeing as the Grande Date was around  cheaper than the standard price of the Power Reserve I decided to get it.Very happy I did! Its a very well made detailed piece and is very pretty to look at.

This my first heavy stainless watch so it took a couple weeks to get used to the weight on my wrist but now its great. This is an automatic watch and one of my favorite features of the watch is that it has a sapphire window on the back side displaying all of the internals of the watch. I had looked at a few watches with blue accent components but this was by far my favorite. The case in this picture is a Wolf watch winder which has great functionality. It has a delayed start feature and can cover a broad range of TPD turns per day.

When I wore a watch in the past I used by Timex Expedition which I purchased for hiking as having an altimeter makes figuring out your location on a mapped trail a lot easier. I also have used a fitness tracker for daily wear for a few years now but its uncomfortable and ugly. The gear S is a nice replacement. So far Im enjoying the functionality and the improved comfort.

I was planning on upgrading the straps but Im in not hurry to do so at this time. I did look at watches such as the Seiko  and Rodina in particular.

Making the timex look a little bit more casual.Going in that same theme the roman numerals are meant to show a dressier watch than the timex.The  inner subdials are spread differently. In the timex they are evenly distributed they are at  and  making them  hours apart while the invicta has them at  and  so two of them are  hours apart this makes the watch look less busy and thus more dressier while the timex design is deliberately making it look more busy that is why it has the larger date window. ,Watches,cymlemr,2,t5_2qls5

6140116,0,t3_3zmv4l,I would second the Ref  case and face though the only way to be sure is to crack it open and check the serial number. You also need to check the serial number on the movement and movement type to check those correspond to the model number else you have whats known as a frankenwatch made up of parts of different watches. The reason Im saying that is that this watch has clearly been serviced badly in the past so Im a little suspicious as to how original it will be under the skin. The tell tale signs are that the crown has been replaced its too tall and round and the face has been redone. The face is missing the Swiss Made at the bottom the main hands and the chronograph hand are wrong and the words Omega Seamaster have been poorly repainted. It also looks like the tick markers have been relumed. The chronograph also has unevenly sized dots. On the plus side the case hasnt been polished so there is a chance a good watch smith could do a sensitive restoration. On the subject of water as mentioned by the above poster you should avoid letting this watch get rained on. My s seamaster has bad seals and gets condensation inside the case whenever it gets wet which can cause corrosion. ,Watches,cynkf1s,3,t5_2qls5

6180610,0,t1_cyrtcq1,gt I guess to get it so thin without an inhouse movement they need to drop the seconds function???Yes and no. Technically speaking theres no reason you cant do the subsecond hand especially on the  movement theyre using because the layout of that movement puts the fourth wheel which the seconds hand would ride on aligned at  so it would be pretty pleasing aesthetically. On the other hand doing sub seconds means you need more vertical space to accommodate the additional hand. They should be able to do that with an additional ..mm. I dont know the specific construction of this watch but if the dial is thick enough I suspect it isnt though being that they intentionally went ultrathin the subsecond dial could be recessed into the dial and not require additional thickness. What they could also do is eliminate the exhibition caseback and go with a solid metal to shave things down and make it even thinner to compensate. ,Watches,cys65ye,7,t5_2qls5

6229442,0,t1_cyxi1nh,Im not the guy you were speaking to previously but can hopefully chime in here. The Orient watch with the numbers is the Orient Mako the one with just dots as markers is the newer Orient Ray.I personally much prefer the look of the Orient Ray dots over the Orient Mako numbers. Is it worth an extra ? Only you can decide. Im sure some people would prefer the Mako to the Ray and therefore not even consider it even if it were cheaper instead of more expensive.For what it is worth Ive got an Orient Ray dots on this Bond NATO strap and it looks magnificent. Even though Ive got dress watches Id have no problems wearing it in a situation such as you describe. Its formal but not stuffy so ideal for a younger guy in a professional environment.

6232751,0,t3_40yg6w,Link to the full albumThis is the SBGR. In my opinion it is one of the best values in the industry. After owning a myriad of watches including a Rolex Explorer  and an Omega Speedmaster . I would put the finishing and detailing above both watches and would say it is superior to many even remotely within its price range. Throughout the case there is just a ridiculous amount of seamless alteration from the brushed and polished elements. The dauphine hands are precisely cut and depending on the lighting can vary from completely subdued to almost glittering. The movement is beautiful. I cant speak highly enough of how wonderful the work on the rotor escapement and other elements are. The mixture of steel coloring with a limited but striking use of gold hits just the right note.Best of all the watch is mm. That to me is the perfect size for a dress watch. On the alligator band its completely appropriate for a formal event. On the steel bracelet its sporty enough for daily wear. I would like to give a particular shout out to Topper Jewelers in Burlingame California. I spent an hour there meeting Rob and his family trying on a bunch of new watches learning about new stuff that theyre collaborating with other manufacturers on and in general just having a really great relaxed time. The sale went flawlessly and they threw in some really really awesome stuff.  It was one of the best experiences Ive had purchasing anything.

6377208,0,t3_42zu31,Talking about common on a forum like this is a pretty extreme example of selection bias.Speedmasters are popular among people who are serious watch enthusiasts. This is due in large part to the history associated with the watch its timeless design and the fact that it occupies a spot in the market that is considered to be the entry level for the luxury tier. Theyre not particularly flashy so you dont tend to see them on people who buy expensive watches as status symbols.When you talk about watches on here though youre talking exclusively with watch enthusiasts. As a result a lot of us have speedmasters. Its also a lot of peoples first big purchase so its only natural that those people want to share.In the general population very few people are watch enthusiasts and even something priced at the entry level to the luxury tier is  times more expensive than what most people would ever even think of spending on a watch. In the  or so years that Ive been interested in watches and paying attention to what people are wearing Ive seen maybe  speedmasters in the wild outside of watchrelatedevents. Of those  two of them were worn by people who I know to be watch enthusiasts. The other two were random sightings.Probably the watch I see the most is the Datejust followed by the seamaster and the submariner.

Ive had this watch for  months or so and it gets most of the wrist time out of my collection. I love that it has quirky good looks but is inexpensive enough that I dont mind it getting banged around.  People often say the OEM metal bracelet is uncomfortable and a hair puller. I wont disagree with that but that leads me to my only real gripe with this watch.

That alone to me is incredible. Their watches are very nice looking. They buy the movements and blank parts from other manufacturers but the watches themselves are made in a little workshop in the back of the store. They sell a couple of preproduced watches but you can get in contact with them and theyll build a watch specifically to your liking.You should definitely check out their website they even have a virtual tour of the store and th workshop As of now Im only a student with an accordingly small budget. But maybe I can get one of their wristwatches as a graduation gift or something.

6491083,0,t3_44j92u,It may seem counterintuitive but it does not despite what others say.Take the following with a boulder of salt  Im not a watchmaker and Im probably using the wrong terminology.Your typical mechanical watch mechanism is unwinding the mainspring at a fixed rate and the rate of this unwinding does not change if the chrono is on or off.  Lets take this in small steps. This mainspring unwinding powers the watch a wound mainspring stores energy and releasing this energy powers the watch.. The watch without the chrono running requires a certain amount of energy from the mainspring.. When the chrono is running additional energy is required.. With each tick the amount of energy released by a fullywound mainspring is more than what the entire watch requires if the chrono was running.. As the mainspring unwinds its releasing energy to power the watch and has less and less stored energy.  In other words the mainspring is becoming weaker.. At some point the energy left in the mainspring is not enough to power the entire watch.  If the chrono is running the watch will stop sooner than if the chrono was off.  This will give the impression that the chrono affects the power reserve.  However if you turn off the chrono the watchs energy requirements are now lower and the watch should again start up because the small amount of remaining mainspring energy should be enough to power the watch without the chrono.Edit see the bottom of this post Edit  now one can make an argument that the power reserve should be however long the watch runs under any circumstances such as running the chrono.  However this is apparently not what manufacturers and watchmakers use.  Youre free to argue that the popular definition of power reserve is not the same as the manufacturerswatchmakers definition.,Watches,czqq5vx,2,t5_2qls5
6494509,0,t1_czqweyt,Looks great beautiful photos.  Wearing this watch with a NATO is the right thing to do so two thumbs way up there.  The lugs on the Steinhart Ocean Ones are pretty flat so even if you like stainless bracelets which I dont they dont really conform to the wrist.  I took mine off a soon as it came out of the padded box.  And even more bonus points for having such a wide collection of straps for it.Curious what are your thoughts about the gray dial?  It seems to be a real lovehate thing with most OVM . owners.  Personally I fell in love with the black dial on the . then bought the OVM . thinking it would be a dark gray and unfortunately had to sell it once I saw it in person as it was just too light in color.

6598305,0,t3_4627l4,Today I received my Braun BN a watch that I have been looking at for the past two years. It is truly a beautiful piece backed by Brauns incredible heritage in the world of Design. The watch is carved out of a single piece of Stainless steel brushed on the sides and sand blasted on the back. The monoblock design allows the case to be seamless more water resistant and according to Braun allows the back to be tapered in the way that it is. The watch presents an unbelievable sense of quality. It is perfectly finished and has a very reassuring weight weighs the same as my iphone s  g  which is quite substantial considering it does not have a metal band. The chamfered edges of the case and saphire crystal reflect beautifully in the light and lume is simply stunning. The watch has an ETA quartz movement and retails for USI definitely cant afford US AU but was able to get it on presumably a pricing error??? for AU US. Im pretty pleased with that.

Here is a link to where I bought it off of ebayThe Process took about min but it was my first time ever doing anything like this so it probably would only take a couple of minutes if you have done it before. I was lucky enough to get a watch repair kit from my parents for Christmas so I had a tool to pop off the bezel from the watch you can also use the dull end of a knife though. Then after that I popped out the insert with my fingers although you could probably get underneath it with a knife or any other tool and put the new insert in!   Putting the bezel back on afterwards is also pretty easy as there is no screwing involved or anything just gotta push hard down on where the bezel fits until you hear a click and youre good to go!

6866008,0,t3_49qa99,First of all few people notice what you wear and so you can wear whatever you like.  Unless you end up working in a prestigious law office or similar fashionconscious environment you can wear dress watches with jeans and casual watches with suits but if you do end up working in a fashionconscious environment youll likely have to set your sights higher than these watches.Of the ones you listed  Id go with the Alpinist SARB.  Its a nice watch and its different than most.  My second choice would be the Cocktail Time SARB.  However the SNZF Sea Urchin is a bit odd here.  While its a good watch its a plainer somewhat lowerquality watch than the others.  If youre considering that Id suggest that you take a look at the Orient Mako USA which is a better quality watch at a similar price point and is now available worldwide.  However given that Orient has just released new versions of the Mako and Ray Ill bet that well see an improved version of the Mako USA in the next year or so.,Watches,d0ukm89,1,t5_2qls5

6984772,0,t3_4bcrzc,Speedy and Shturmanskie are manual. I wear the Shtumanskie every other day. I wind every night before I go to sleep. It is no problem. I picked the manual Speedmaster for two reason it was a bit slimmer and more importantly considerably cheaper used when I bought it. I prefer manual wind as they tend to have much prettier movements in my price ranges and I do like the feeling of winding it. Since I started on Russian and Soviet watches when I was a kid winding was always a pleasurable thing. I just like the act and routine of it. I have both automatics and manual wind watches and love them equally. I like prewinding an automatic that has been out of a winder and unworn for a while. ,Watches,d182b4x,1,t5_2qls5

In the picture you linked to the Memovoxs case looks to be in spectacular condition for on older piece. But the alarm inner dial has a single indicator mark not the distinctive triangle? I prefer the triangle. Someone more knowledgable can comment. Dat Geomatic tho!  Am I reading this right COSC certified chronometer and  Vibrations Per Hour? Only about  made in stainless steel? Pretty unique piece of history there.The Geomatic comes off more squarish with the lugs blending into the case like they do. The Memovox is very circular reminding me of Vacheron Constanin style. Dials are beautiful on both. I prefer the hands on the Geomatic though as the blunted style on the Memovox is not to my taste. I love the idea of a mechanical alarm and that would probably swing me towards the Memovox. However if your interest is already piqued by the Geomatic then by all means go that route!

It shows people that mechanical watches can have a sense of humour playful and youthful. Serious watch makers publicity campaigns are all broadly similar they portray luxury tell their audience that buying their watches is a symbol of success and being a discerning gentleman the watch makers that appear in the ads invariably dress in white lab coats labouring intensely in a state of the art workshop.

7261611,0,t1_d230bsy,I do like it so Im very happy with it!  Ive collected Swatches for a while and I couldnt justify spending that much buying one of these when they first came to the US last year. I was used to paying  per watch for older quartz movements buying them preowned on auction sites.  I held off and didnt buy one.  I had picked this particular one out buy my mother actually bought it for me.  I wanted one as a gift this Christmas but we had a crazy few months and didnt really have a real Christmas this year.  I went shopping with her last week and I wanted to swing by the Swatch store to see if there was anything interesting and she offered to get me a Christmas gift albeit a few months late.  Sentimentally I love it.  As a gift I love it! As a watch I love it so far!  Well see how durability stands up a year or two or five down the line.I want a  or another automatic stainless or gold Seiko in a little while.  Ive always liked Swatches since I was a kid so much because Im a goofy guy a lot of time so a goofy bold looking watch like a Swatch fits my personality.  Plus theyre an awesome watch for well under .  This new one has gotten more compliments in a week than the gold and stainless Tag Heuer Ive worn most days since I turned  has gotten since Ive owned it.  ,Watches,d23le8q,1,t5_2qls5

7435076,0,t3_4h3ebx,If I might make a suggestion...If quartz is what you want you might want to try a solar or kinetic watch such as this one The reason I suggest this is that one of the issues youll come across wearing basic quartz is having to change the battery.  However a kinetic watch uses the movement of your wrist to charge the watch and a solar watch uses the sun.  You may eventually need to change out the battery or capacitor but theyre both still quartz movements and theyll both go much longer before you ever have to open up the back of the watch to get at the battery.So here are some kinetic watches And here are some solar watches Apologies for the number of nonroman numeral watches  the website allowed me to narrow down based on Kinetic or Solar but didnt have anything for narrowing down based on number style on the dial.

7627109,0,t1_d394a3u,I absolutely love my C Trident Pro  GMT the quality and fit and finish what a vague term but its the only term I can think of is fantastic. Its currently my favorite watch. My C Malvern MkII Purple is also great not quite as nice as my Trident I think but still a great piece and certainly good quality.That said Im unsure if I would buy those pieces at full price. Im not saying they arent worth it but there historically dont know about now with the new site and branding and whatnot what might have changed businesswise have been  off sales pretty often throughout the year and at those prices the quality and aesthetics make these watches a steal.The only downside is that some individuals in the watches community might look down on the company because they do admittedly tend to dohave done some pretty  homagesknock offs of more expensive watches like the C being a BampR or the C Harrison being an IWC Portugieser Chronograph but at the end of the day  I straight up cant afford those luxury brands  Im still getting a nicer ETA movement or inhouse adjusted ETA these days for a great price and  what  watch company doesnt have knock off of an IWC or an Omega or what have you these days? Its just easy to scoff from their high expensive horses.Overall Id def recommend the company they have great service and the watches are very nice.,Watches,d395tir,2,t5_2qls5

I still had to wind up the cheap one and set it multiple times a day so this is a major upgrade for me. He set it before he gave it to me and I havent even touched the crown since I got it this Sunday. I would highly recommend the model to anyone looking for a good start and Id appreciate if anyone has any cool information about my watch.

7636242,0,t3_4jwr4w,Hey guys. I know a lot of people here and online knock the price and quality of Hodinkee products and straps but I recently picked up their taupe leather calf and wanted to give it a chance. Its extremely soft and I feel like the color matches the vintage inspired Tribute to Deep Sea very well. Ive always been a fan of contrast stitching on any kind of strap so this one is right up my alley. Each strap apparently is handmade and unique but I feel like it was a little overpriced. Probably wont get another one anytime soon. Ive had this JLC for a couple months now and figured Id add a new strap to give it some life.

Anything with the Identify tag is exempt from the  character comment requirement so all we are left with is just three pictures with no context. Heres one that seems like OP wanted identified because he feared it was fake. This is a fantasy replica that was tagged as Identify. Part of identifying what a watch is will always be trying to authenticate it. Right now the rule seems to be based on the intent of thread starter which is impossible to know.  In my mind the easiest way to decide what has goes in its own thread and what goes in a weekly thread is physical possession of the watch because then we have an opportunity to ask questions and learn more.  That would leave threads like this this and this to go in a weekly thread.,Watches,d3dq50z,1,t5_2qls5

I have not bought a watch off eBay but I know a user on here that bought a Nomos on eBay for a good deal. Nomos has a fairly fixed price for their repairs which is located on their website.

This isnt a ceramic Daytona and you can get a more attractive price for it than you might think. You are definitely paying something for the IWC name but it is finished with extremely well better than the Tudor Black Bay I have in the same price range and has features like AR coating on the crystal that lower end watches dont have.

Just because I cannot yet make a new balance staff doesnt mean Im not more than competent to make a repair or more experienced in some repairs than someone who can. This is not a thing of absolutes and in the service industry the times you will make a balance staff or stem is very low. . of the time  you will buy a part rather than make it because its cheaper. You only make a part for an expensive watch that doesnt have the part available. Think old vacheron constantine.Im not misrepresenting my clients theyre fully aware with my skills and what I do as well as my experience level.

I did a full post on this Patek Philippe Nautilus  a few months ago and thought Id share a few recent images that Ive also posted on Instagram The love affair continues and is stronger than I expected.If youre not familiar with this watch the Nautilus was introduced in  and was Pateks answer to APs Royal Oak. The steel version has changed only slightly since then and now can be had with a white dial as seen here as opposed to the more traditional blue.Why have I been favoring this watch over my other steel watches?

I have owned this watch since early  and four years is a bit early for service given that I do not wear my watches daily or very hard. However it had been recently running s per day after previously operating closer to s so I wanted to be cautious as I truly plan to own this piece forever.I am pleased to report that Nomos service lived up to every expectation and then some. Communication throughout was excellent turnaround time was less than seven weeks from when they received it and somehow the case seems to look better than new. There was a pretty noticeable series of scratches on the top right lug that were very noticeable. Gone. The watch now seems to be running around s per day after a weeks worth of wear. Wonderful.The Club remains the most versatile watch in my collection. For that reason its  week absence was a challenge for my rotation and I found myself reaching for it constantly. I cant recommend the Club Nomos or the Nomos service center more highly and I am simply foaming at the mouth to finally get my backordered Zurich Weltzeit Nachtblau into my grubby hands.,Watches,d4a39p7,4,t5_2qls5

Ive never felt that way about another watches logo though so it feels not quite right. I also dislike a number of the design decisions they made such as rotating the minute marker numbers but maintaining vehicle power reserve indicators. And the fact that theyve labeled its purpose. Edit and I just noticed its utterly absurd thickness. Its deeper than a Pelagos an outrageously capable dive watch for no apparent reason. Double edit Its quoted timing is   seconds a day. This just keeps getting better and better Triple edit I should add that the Pelagos is water resistant to m has an  hour power reserve is COSC a date complication and has a helium escape valve.

8596714,0,t3_4xjv7p,Am a mechanical engineer working in the polymer industry  unless you really force the screw threads in the wrong way or do something silly like using a hammer those threads should be just fine. Just be aware that polycarbonate doesnt have great scratch resistance. Odds are theres some hardening coating over it but if you wear through that youll get some scratching. For water resistance you should be more worried about the seals for the watch than the poly casing. As long as you dont shower with the watch hot steam isnt friendly to most plastics or rubbers it should hold up just fine! And dont knock plastic  it can be pretty darn awesome sometimes! High performance plastics are wonderful things and can be found in aircraft engines and as bearings in the transmissions of some cars PEEK polymers. Now this  isnt anything like that but polycarb is some tough stuff that has great mechanical properties.Now if youre looking at frictionwear properties my primary area for rugged work polycarb probably isnt the way to go. For a watch in this price range that case is probably made of low or medium molecular weight polycarbonate which has poorer frictionwear properties but makes molding much easier for manufacturing. Like I said above it probably has a hardened layer on the surface but if that wears through you might start getting some deeper more visible scratches. If the coating is done right it would take a significant amount of counter surface friction to remove it. TLDR  Threads will be fine unless you force it in the wrong way. Case should be fine unless the probably present hardened layer rubs off unlikely then youll get some noticeable scratches. Plastics are cool! ,Watches,d6g6iu8,3,t5_2qls5

8960000,0,t1_d7oskko,I wouldnt say magnets arent a huge concern. Quartz watches work because of a tiny magnetic motor so a strong enough field will cause issues. Generally close proximity to a strong enough magnet will simply cause the watch to stop but it can do other strange things as well. It may also be possible for a strong enough field to permanently damage the movement if it messes with the stator or permanent magnet in the rotor. This is also the reason a quartz watch should never be run through a demagnetizer. ,Watches,d7ouvw6,2,t5_2qls5

8978825,0,t3_539k5e,What up rwatches?Ive been following this subreddit for about the past two years roughly the same amount of time since I began my deep dive into the world of horology.  Earlier today I received a beautiful custommade Cognac shell cordovan strap from Rover Haven and I so I figured it was as good a time as any to make my first post!I emailed Myron over at Rover Haven about a month ago after seeing his straps featured on FratelloWatches with the expectation that it would be a long wait before I would actually receive the strap as he was still on his summer sabbatical.  To my surprise Myron emailed me this past Wednesday and had my strap made the same day.  Even aside from the strap itself the customer experience that I received in working with Myron is what will keep me coming back.With that said I also wanted to share the story of how I decided upon the . Speedy as my first watch over .  Like many millennials I never really understood the purpose of having a watch on my wrist when my phone would always be there to tell the time.  I received my first watch from my father upon earning my Masters Degree a Citizen EcoDrive Chronograph.  I began regularly wearing the watch but it was still another year or so before I really bought into the notion of beginning to amass a collection.  After much time deliberating on which pieces to begin adding to what I assumed would be a collection that I would keep to affordable under  watches I decided upon the ubiquitous Seiko SKX followed by the Seiko SARB Cocktail Time.  At this point youll see that I have certainly influenced by the hive mind that is rwatches however I do truly love these pieces and plan to keep them in the collection.It was at this time when my father passed away after years of deteriorating from the ill effects of chemotherapy after having battled with NonHodgkin Lymphoma.  My father was never one who owned or seemed to care about having a nice watch but as he was the one who got me my start in watches and I realized my own personal connection to watches I felt it would be appropriate to honor him in some way with the purchase of a nice watch.Even before I was into watches I was always drawn to the aesthetic of the Omega Speedmaster Pro.  I knew nothing of its origin as a racing watch or even it history in space.  Despite my attraction I wanted to put in my due diligence and research into what would be the perfect watch given the circumstances.  I began to think through what kind of watch would best represent my father but had a very difficult time doing so without making it a stretch.  After months and months of research I was brought back to the Speedy.  I came to the realization that my father would have wanted me to get what I truly liked rather than trying to get a watch that would represent him.  I decided on the . w tritium lume Serial dates to  as it was the most modern interpretation with the tritium dial and vintage aesthetic that I craved.  I pulled the trigger a little over a month ago on an example with box amp papers and which had been serviced earlier this year in Japan from a fellow redditor shoutout to ubittn!Sorry for the super long post but hopefully it was worth the read! The Speedy will always be part of my collection and I hope to one day pass it and the love of horology onto my future son.  Cheers!TLDR Received a beautiful strap amp great service from Rover Haven for my Speedy and ultimately purchased the watch in remembrance of my late father.,Watches,d7r49da,7,t5_2qls5

Regardless I really enjoy the diver and nato strap style as well as dress watches.

Got any watch tips or need to knows I should know about are greatly appreciated. And while youre here Id love to know what helped get you through highschool and collegeuniversityIm Canadian so there is a differenceStudy tips getaways motivation or really anything LOL.

Over time they can slowly degrade the magstrip information until its unreadable.This probably isnt much of a concern in Europe.  Its a problem in the US because so many places are still using magstrips on credit cards.

Sure its an ETA movement but very nicely decorated and keep in mind the watch is HALF the price of the cheapest watch NOMOS makes and the same price as Sinns cheapest watches.

9411491,0,t3_59jnge,Hi AllThis is the second piece I took delivery of today the Kari Voutilainen Vingt in Platinum. Completely different extreme than the GF. Its about as classic as it gets. I am particularly drawn to this dial which is machine turned by hand. Kari owns his own dial manufacturer so he has many different dials on his pieces. Also the inhouse movement features a huge balance wheel which uses a Breguet overcoil while the interior curve employs a Grossman Curve. Ive never seen another watch with a Grossman Curve and its intricacies are fascinating. I am not talented enough to explain this but I would urge you all to lear a bit about it. Also the escapement is the first one to ever feature both together which apparently more efficient than traditional lever escapements. This lower energy usage in theory should help out with daytoday wear and tear. ,Watches,d98z0oc,10,t5_2qls5

9433556,0,t1_d9bngpr,Yes I have the Seiko Cocktail time on my wish list for a long time. Theres just this one thing that I am not a fan of in this watch  the hour markers look like sharp teeth pointing inwards. I prefer something a bit more like the SEIKO PRESAGE Prestige SARX with proper rectangular hour markers and without the divisions between the second markers like in the Grand Seiko SBGX But both of these are way more expensive. I dont know why they put in more stuff in the dials cheap watches and less stuff in the dials of expensive watches!! I think a clean dial with less on it looks more beautiful! Anyways I am going to keep looking and in case I do not find anything to my liking Ill get the Seiko Cocktail time. Thank you for the suggestion anyway.,Watches,d9brokc,2,t5_2qls5

Even though it doesnt actually effect the accuracy of the watch its neat to see how they were able to engineer something as complicated as a tourbillon into something small enough to fit on my wrist. This IWC is mounted on an aftermarket black leather strap since I prefer this to the texture of the Santoni strap that it comes on I think that the plain black without an pattern matches the dial pretty well.,Watches,d9h3d2p,2,t5_2qls5
9476658,0,t3_5aj5by,FeedbackRonda ! LuxuryLuxury in the watch world starts with brands like Omega Zenith IWC etc.Your watches are fashion watches not luxury watches. Everyone is launching a minimalist watch brand on kickstarter. The watches themselves are not unique at all.The straps are...interesting...but thats about all this has going for it. Theyre a very specific look and there may be a market out there for them but I dont know what that is yet.As nice of a story it is as to how you came up with your name its not going to sell these straps or watches. They need to stand on their own merits and right now they dont. The name is also a problem. Its a bit of a phonetic mess and sounds like two words crashed together. Its not something your average person is going to be able to pronounce or relate to.For naming lets look at a successful brand. Nomos is the greek god of law. Its also a nice sounding short word thats easy to pronounce. Nomos doesnt try to sell you the story of their name. They sell you on good watches that are constructed logically. The name is conceptually appropriate but you dont need a paragraph of background information or to know the story at all in order to appreciate the brand.I would say that if you want to pursue watch design you need to spend as much time on the watch as you are on the straps. While theyre not something that Id ever buy the straps are unique. The watch doesnt offer anything that I cant get from a slew of other brands. ,Watches,d9h7alt,1,t5_2qls5

I had never had a high quality watch before and I took a liking to all the Tissots. I saw this watch with the chronograph but the price was too high even at the duty free ship prices. So when I got home I found the watch on Amazon and there is sat on my wish list for a whole year. So tonight on the eve of my th birthday my wife surprised me with this Quickster!

10022033,0,t3_5j7g73,Hi everyone we have heard most of your comments and were finally able to work out the logistics and do a stainless steel version. We have decided to keep the blued hands for that extra bit of color while having it come default in black straps. While it is a stretch goal it is placed at  of the total funding required so this SS edition is more or less confirmed if the funding takes off.Overall it has been a really interesting journey and we hope our goals will be reached.

10038852,0,t3_5jh1cc,From what I can tell this is a blaringly obvious fake. My research shows nothing of the like. The date window is poorly aligned and I believe this is fake. Please let me know. Information on the brandgt In  Vacheron Constantin introduced the Mtiers dArt Les Masques collection of timepieces featuring miniature reproductions of primitive art masks. The company selected twelve masks from a private museum collection and reproduced the masks on a small scale. The miniaturized masks are featured in the dial centre of every watch from the Les Masques collection.in  Vacheron Constantin introduced the Mtiers dArt Les Univers Infinis collection of timepieces featuring tessellation a design of interlocking identical shapes inspired by the work of Dutch artist Maurits Cornelis Escher.In  during the Manufactures th Anniversary year Vacheron Constantin revealed the worlds most complicated mechanical watch named reference . It took three watchmakers eight years to build the complication marvel at the request of a client. In the Bloomberg.com interview about this grand complication Vacheron Constantin would not disclose the exact price of this watch but did confirm that the price was between the  million and  million U.S. dollars that had been estimated on various internet sites.,Watches,dbg37db,2,t5_2qls5

10044956,0,t1_dbguybc,I understand what you mean. I think that solid endlink requirement grew out a slightly bad experience with one of my Seikos  curved end links. I deformed it slightly when removing the bracelet for the first time my bad I know and I had to have a watchmaker fix it didnt want to risk deforming it in the opposite direction by trying to fix it myself. I also keep getting the feeling that the relatively low quality bracelet jingles a lot. But maybe Im just being pedantic by insisting that the end links also be solid.

10056888,0,t1_dbiepao,I think he meant that the rotating timing bezel can be used as a second hour dial.  For example if you want to set a second time zone which is  hours compared to your primary time zone. You rotate the bezel backwards  hours. This way on the bezel you will be able to read a time  hours ahead of your local one but in my opinion its not really practical since rotating bezels generally shoe minutes instead of hours it is obviously more useful for diving and timing in general and some of them dont even have it marked all the way.  Maybe my inner math guy  watch nerd ratio is skewed towards math but for me adding or subtracting a few small natural numbers is way easier and quicker than converting a minute track to hours.  But nice lifehack regardless and who am I to judge these as I generally dont like divers or GMT watches as I tend to like fewer complications. ,Watches,dbifqq0,2,t5_2qls5

10062573,0,t3_5jq4uh,I think the rolex is probably fake. Ive never seen a cellini like this before but theyve made a lot of weird stuff so who knows. But the dial says T Swiss T which is a mark used to indicate the presence of tritium but this watch doesnt seem to have any lume that I can see so there would be no need for that.

As I get older I prefer to buy something that I know will last a very long time. Hence the adage you get what you pay for.Theres a reason why the Seiko SKX has so many mods. Or that the Hamilton Khaki Field is recommend so highly for a field watch. Theres multiple threads each week about someone being passed down a good Swiss or Japanese watch.

Its your life and money.If you have the cash to invest and earn more after capital gains tax than the interest expense then you are up! Otherwise the interest payments you are talking about are literally paying for the convenience of having something before you can actually afford it. Even if you can afford the monthly payments the interest is a great way to literally throw away money to the finance company. In your example you are paying  for something that was worth  when you paid for it does that make sense to do for a luxury you dont need??Anyways good conversation and good day.,Watches,dbz3qjw,2,t5_2qls5

A cleaning is fine but no polishing or replacement of any visible parts such as the dial and hands but replacing the bracelet and crystal is ok.

10320429,0,t1_dcdkm4w,I am also a female watch collector and thought that a lot of parallels could be drawn between this article and the experience some women have in the gaming industry. I seem to encounter women who have two drastically different experiences. Those who genuinely adopt the hobby as a passion and integrate themselves within the community may still experience the occasional sexism but their overall daytoday experience is a positive one due to the type of people with whom they surround themselves  this has been my personal experience. Then you have those who try to enter as the token girl and make everything a feminist issue. These women dont tend to have that great of a time. That said I can see why her experience in the watch world may be different. If the women cant vote until the s attitude has in any way permeated the professional watch world that would be incredibly frustrating. I also buy predominantly mens watches and ALWAYS get a weird look or comment when I say its for me and not a boyfriend when purchasing in person. But that social stereotype goes both ways. I laughed at the end of this article because I said the exact same thing the other day. I was wearing a mans watch with a classic design and a random woman walked up to me and asked if I thought that my watch looked androgynous.

10385248,0,t3_5oqguj,My opinion Ive offered before on themThere was someone who did a review over at WUS I dont recall the specifics but the majority of the watches as expected were cheap junk Chinese mushroom brand watches with high MSRP but always being sold at huge discounts. The every member gets a Rolex a week thing is interesting and assuming theyre all authentic theyre probably all vintage pieces in quite poor condition and wouldnt fetch much on the second hand market. Sure pretty much the majority of all working Rolex will cost more than the subscription but I think its just a cost the company is willing to eat in order to attract people who dont know much about watches and just see the Rolex.As a gift if the person is a watch enthusiast I personally wouldnt see it as a good gift since theyre more likely to not want cheap watches that they havent chose themselves. Consider looking at getting perhaps a watch winder a watch box a watch roll some straps or some tools insteadIf the person isnt into watches a watch a month is a lot. By the end of the year someone who isnt into watches is going to have  watches. Thats a lot for someone who is not an enthusiast.

10447250,0,t3_5pmggl,Hi rwatches! I was showing a visitor around around the Edoera trading city of Kawagoe Japan this weekend and made a pilgrimage to an old clock shop there.  The gentleman who runs it always has quite a few immaculate pieces.  After weighing an absolutely stunning Seiko Goldfeather against this  Seiko Crown I had to go with Stainless since it matches most of my wardrobe better.  The markers are reminiscent of the Cocktail Time but the face is a flatpainted silver no starburst brushing or anything.  The shop owner knows I like to peek and see if the movement is clean Ive bought a few pieces there.  I normally dont think year olds look good naked but this one sure does SFW  Diashock is the Seiko trademark for the shockresistant mechanism using a floating balance wheel jewel.  This technology was invented in Switzerland in the s under the Incabloc trademark.  Balance wheels are one of the heaviest parts in a mechanical watch and their rapid motion requires the least resistance and therefore the thinnest pinions.  This means that a big fall can bend the pinions and thus damage the watch.  These antishock mechanisms work by allowing the jewel to float under a spring and a thicker part of the pinion to hit against a guard rather than putting the pressure on the ends of the pinion and the spring then pushes the balance wheel back into position and thus saving the watch.,Watches,dcsa9fy,15,t5_2qls5

Soon my nicest will be a Steinhart Ocean GMT and I plan on wearing that bad boy quite a bit. If I were in your shoes I would probably be too nervous to wear the nice watch but over time those special events become more regular and with more time on your wrist youll find yourself wearing the Speedy more. That said I dont think I could wear that EVERY day. I like having a few nice ones to rotate between. ,Watches,dcyssl5,3,t5_2qls5

For my first proper watch I want something that Im going to be able to wear to special events without feeling casual but which would not be out of place for everyday wear either so no excessive bling. I dont really know what style I would like though as Ive never had a proper watch. Im studying astrophysics so my dream watch would be a constellationplanetarium one which I could probably never afford.My price range would be anything up to AUD and itd have to be very comfortable as despite being righthanded I wear my watch on my right wrist.

Also because of the smaller amount of lubrication approximately  of the amount used in Swiss lever movements it will keep a tighter daily rate over the years.So as an equivalent Swiss lever watch may end up outside of COSC spec after  years itll take more like  for the coaxial.This was proven to me recently as my Railmaster just went in for service after  years.

10546858,0,t3_5qdj44,It was serviced about  years ago and before that I do not know. It was an inheritance from my grandfather. I was going to put it on one day over my dining room table and it slipped off my wrist and fell on the table back cover popped off and a gear came out. I have photos of after it happened and also before when it was open to show the piece. Basically they said they have to repivot that gear and also do a service while it is apart. They wont do a partial service and it would be an open ticket while he works on it. He has worked on the watch before so I brought it to him but hes asking  for the service and  for the repivoting. Seems a bit high of a price for that and wanted to get another opinion on it. I live outside of NYC so figure that would be a good place to start.,Watches,dd3lrhm,1,t5_2qls5
10547259,0,t3_5qxsqy,I dont understand all the hate for tag. I have a Carrera and recently bought an aquaracer and think they are awesome looking watches. The detail on the dial is extremely nice. I have not regretted my purchases. I was also looking at Oris as theyre great watches and a bargain. Sure an Oris wouldve drawn more attention to watch people but I just liked the look of the aquaracer more. Buy what looks cool to you. No one will look at the watch more than you will. I wouldnt spend that kind of money on a quartz though. Having said that I think you should buy a tag from the gray market. I just got one from jomashop and couldnt be happier. It is authentic came with all the packaging my tag from AD has and has a  year warranty. I think at that price point save a couple hundred bucks and go gray market.Also with k budget you can buy a new Omega which will impress watch enthusiasts and general public. I really wanted a seamaster when I bought my aquaracer and wouldve thrown the extra g for it but my wife is hinting at a Rolex for our next anniversary. Im hinting at Omega to her. I know Rolex is a better watch but I just like the look of Omega. Cant help what I like. Perfect example of buy what you like. Not what others like. I also prefer new watches again buy from gray market and save serious cash. I would have no qualms buying Omega from gray market.,Watches,dd3nee7,1,t5_2qls5

Jewels fitted in chatons this was done before the Verneuil Process. The bridge arrangement is fairly typical of that era. Stem wind usually not before ishThe ship on the dial is French big giveaway is the flag. Id say its more likely it was traded with a French sailor for a few cartons of Luckies if in fact it was picked up during the first war.Im taking a bit of a stab here but Im going to guess the ship on the dial is the French Ironclad La Galissonnire. Id need a clearer shot to identify it any better. This would date the watch to the s as the ship was taken out of service in . I dont think its any older than that. I could be wrong here. It may be one of the previous generation Ironclads.The red stuff on the markers would have been on all the markers originally.The watch has been dropped several times which you can tell from the cracked enamel and the missing enamel on the markers.This watch could be restored relatively painlessly if you wanted to as it looks complete and has relatively little damage.Value wise Ill guess between  depending on the buyer.,Watches,ddpkv20,25,t5_2qls5

These luxury objects should be more fun and innovative as possible. We accept creativity and ingenuity in most other aspects of life  technology art transportation finance fashion etc.  but have a hard time with watches? Head scratcher. In my view part of the problem is that watches arent viewed and widely accepted as an asset class like art cars boats real estate stocks Birkins diamonds etc. so theres a perception about watches when something becomes an accepted asset class then creativity and ingenuity flow as it perceived as a lesser risk. ,Watches,de8z459,3,t5_2qls5

They all have some elements that give an air of reproduction the line weight in Omega and Automatic are a bit thick. There were many variations of the  scripting but the G looks a bit suspect especially the upper serif on the G. The Seamaster is very close but the S looks to have a microscopically different curve and the amount of negative space inside the letter as seems a bit more than usual.Do you perhaps have the reference number and the first two digits of the serial number? If you can find reference images then it will help a great deal.

11013721,0,t3_5x9t0s,So. this is the first time im posting in reddit. Im posting this guide to anyone who want to buy  already buying Seiko Green Turtle in Indonesia  through Indonesian sellers. Apparently all the Seiko Green Turtle that appeared in Indonesian local and online shops are sold without the limited edition box and rubber straps. This is the question that i had when i bought mine in a local store. The Sales girl told me that they sold it as singles. with normal box. So i think they sold it separately because in indo they sold it cheaper than other sellers in malay singapore or US. In indo they sold it at .million rupiah or about US  discount may vary between store to store. While in malay and singapore they sold it at a higher price about . So i thought to myself. why not just buy it cheaper without the box and strap.Buuut. i was wrong. Seiko did sold it as a Limited Edition set in Indonesia. Its just that the box and the straps havent arrived yet. My local watch store doesnt know that its a Limited edition watch with a box and strap. And after a discussion in youtube and reddit. i decided that i have to ask my watch store about the box and strap set. After explaining things to the sales person in charge. and insisting that other people who bought it get the box and strap set she  contact their central office and contact the official seiko office. After  two weeks with no further info. At last my local store contact me and told me i can pick up my limited box and strap.I was worried that they might asking for an additional fee. but they dont. She give me the limited box including the rubber strap. signing my purchase note. and give me a warm farewell. So if you already bought a Seiko Green Turtle without the rubber strap and limited box. Better ask your store where you bought it for the box and strap. If they promise you they will send it to you. im sure they wil.  you just have to remind them. if your seller is credible. happy hunting ,Watches,degdhj0,13,t5_2qls5

11073252,0,t3_5y4okk,Hi everyone firsttime poster here. Ive worn Timex Weekenders for most of the last decade so I wanted to get something special after graduating from university getting a new job and meeting my personal savings goals. My heart was set on purchasing an Omega so after doing some research and a lot of lurking here I went to my local boutique to check out a few models. Although the Speedy Pro was at the top of my list I didnt really like how large it looked on my wrist due to the crown guard and mm size. However I stumbled upon the FOIS and was immediately enamored with the slightly smaller size and lack of crown guards. I found a brand new example via grey market at a very reasonable price and struck a deal. Been wearing this for a few weeks now and I gotta say Im in love!Edit grammar,Watches,den55r7,18,t5_2qls5
11078935,0,t3_5y7s0b,After a very reasonable  month wait my Sinn Military II arrived back from RGM. Id forgotten how much I missed wearing it and how hefty this watch is. I had sent it last November when I noticed it was gaining a bit each day and also the chronographs minute hand would get stuck between  minutes. Now its keeping great time again at sday which is what it was at originally  they also replaced the moisture capsule. Just my luck though when I put it on my wrist the bezel insert popped loose. Fortunately a little bit of cleanup  epoxy and a lbs weight fixed that issue. While it was in the shop it made me realize I needed to change my mindset of abusing the watch every chance I had like a test. Last year it was worn  in the ocean weight room sauna shower active sports motorcycle riding lots of vibrations work etc. Im still going to wear it when itll come in handy but for the other little things like the sauna or shower basketball moto rides slim Hamilton mechanical for this etc.. after paying the overhaul service fee its opened my eyes to taking better care of time pieces. I love this watch and it cleaned up well at RGM. Its also nice to have the chronograph feature back when timing food running my kids timeouts. Like my post several months ago.. another year to look forward to putting this watch to work and adding a few more knicks and character.,Watches,denscj6,12,t5_2qls5

At the moment Im using it to time my medication intervals and also to see what time it is where my parents are on holiday.I bought the watch a year ago but sadly it doesnt get as much wrist time as I would like because it is a tad bit too big on my small wrists to my liking.

11319605,0,t1_dff0oi7,Maybe you see it that way but I see it as a simplified way to describe a viable alternative. Its the same reason I still refer to a vegan cheese steak as a cheese steak because its a shorthand for what I eat when I want a cheese steak. Vegans need shoes and belts just as much as anybody else and the shorthand terminology makes it easier in a market where finding what we need is a real pain in the ass.    You dont have to give up computers and cell phones and pets to be vegan. Its currently a harm reduction strategy even if you just cut animals out of your diet youve taken away the vast majority of animal consumption from your lifestyle. Its not currently feasible to be  animal free but you can be pretty close and a large number of people consuming in this way will eventually change the market so there will be alternatives to things like gelatin in phones and computers too.

The watch is high build quality and id love to know more about it. under the canteen watch cover is what looks like a charging port and there is a micro SD card under the casing. you can see the camera lense on the front if you look closely. unfortunately the person who removed the back was pretty heavy handed and pulled the case off along with the battery. Thanks,Watches,dfn5tdj,7,t5_2qls5

11479350,0,t3_63uzvb,I got myself this Seiko Sea Urchin and I am really satisfied with the way it wears on my wrist and how it looks. I got really into watches about  years ago and have been reading a lot about them since.  I am ever since in love with the Rolex Submariner. Hopefully I will own a Submariner at some point in the future but for now this will will cure that itch. I would not trust myself with such an expensive watch at this time anyways. I lost my first mechanical watch which was  a seiko snzg during a night out in Amsterdam. I left the house with the watch on my wrist and woke up the next day without it. Not sure what happend exactly but I think it either got stolen of my wrist or I traded it in for a bottle of Bacardi... After that I bought a William L dress watch which looks really nice but I missed having a nice mechanical steel sports watch. I did some research on affordable alternatives for the Submariner and got really interested in the Steinhart Ocean One but did not like the idea of wearing a watch that looks so identical to the Submariner. I would hate for people to ask me if I was a Rolex and having to explain that it is a homage. I think the Sea Urchin has a really nice design to it looks good with both formal and casual clothes. I also considered the SKX but the watch is a little to utilitarian for my taste and it is the watch my father wears.  I picked up the Sea Urchin for about  in the US  where I am currently studying. It will be  a nice souvenir for when I get back home that will remind me of my time here. Hopefully this watch will last me longer than my old Seiko and will continue my watch hobby in the future.Let me know what you think of my choice!,Watches,dfx6iun,7,t5_2qls5

The only downside is that you dont get a manufacturer warranty but that is easily counter balanced by the fact you will save hundreds to thousands to even tens of thousands of dollars over an AD. You also have to keep in mind its rare for a luxury swiss watch from a quality brand to even need warranty service in the first place. But also the cost of that service minus whatever discount you bought the watch for through a grey dealer will oftentimes STILL be more cost efficient than purchasing from an AD.Another minor downside to a grey dealer is that they may not have your watch in stock and it will take them a few days to a few weeks to source it from their supplier.

11643718,0,t1_dgfqits,Even if they found a way to make it fit with the case dial and hands OP would end up with pretty much worthless frankenwatch. Take a look at a Omega quartz movement   look at the spacing between parts which makes it repairable see how it can be adjusted with a screw etc etc. Its a high end quartz movement made by quality parts and the heart of a horological time piece.Sure a modern Ronda would be equally accurate but it doesnt have a soul ,Watches,dgftuup,3,t5_2qls5
11658155,0,t1_dgh3xj3,Get the Nighthawk. It has some amazing reviews and actual heritage as a watch. Plus some really cool features. The slide rule will allow you to make quick calculations including divisions and multiplications. The lume is super bright and looks amazing. The airplane GMT hand is useful and neat you can set it at same time as the main time and it becomes a  hour time indicator as well. The whole design of the watch is based on airplanes even the links in the bracelet. The bracelet is really high quality for the price. Only issue is the use of mineral crystal though Im sure it can be replaced with sapphire if you want.,Watches,dghgswv,1,t5_2qls5

The spiral pattern on the dial alternates matte and metallic and catches the light a lot better than pictures show. The lume is really cool when you charge it up unfortunately it only stays bright for about  seconds. Anyone know anything about old Oris watches?

11664342,0,t1_dgi5tgu,Yeah Steinhart do have some original designs now but a few years ago it was hard for me to justify the difference between a Sub replica from China and the ETA equipped Steinharts. Of course they were wildly popular and people had nothing but praise for Steinhart it still looked like bandwagoning off an established watch. If I want a watch and can find a well made homage not a copy an alternative as TGV names it I would jump on it.

11732308,0,t1_dgpp9yz,I agree. Grand Seiko also sells very expensive quartz though I know its a much more complex movement and people never poo poo on it. Ditto on the quartz Omegas. Sinn also.I have one of the quartz Aquaracers and while yeah I was bit apprehensive on the price I really love it. You get all the quality of a Swiss diver heavy solid feel with the ease of ownership from a quartz. I can be rough with it go to concerts get in mosh pits theme parks etc. and not worry about damage to the movement. Best part? No  dollar service in  years. For those reasons I think theres room for high end quartz watches. Also Seiko wouldnt pour so much R amp D into their F if they didnt think it worth it either that movement is something. ,Watches,dgpvyel,3,t5_2qls5

All the fakes around here and leniency around them is making this sub a shitty place. Heavy moderation on Watchuseek and The Rolex Forums is what makes those forums better places for watch discussion.Edit Maybe these posts are being reported because people are sick of shitty wrist shots as individual posts. Listen to the people. Dont make a post about it days later and tell them to stop. If you want to be a mod listen to people and try to fix things rather than telling them to fuck off.

11777435,0,t3_681vv9,This is my new Orient Flight Watch. Same movement as the Bambino but packed in what feels like a thicker case. The case is brushed steel and the dial is black with lume on the number marker and sword hands. Ive changed the genuine leather band because it was terrible quality and didnt suit the watch. I originally had it on an engineer link bracelet but this black shark mesh really suits it well in my opinion. I had been lusting over Jeremy Clarksons IWC Ceramic Fliegerstyle watch while watching The Grand Tour. Although beautiful and worth every penny to be sure I still like to eat so this was the compromise. Either way my dog Ginger is happy that it runs on pets. Ive only been wearing it for a few days but Ive already got a ton of compliments more than the price tag would have you believe. I paid  VND  USD. The lume is so thick that it is noticeably raised which gives it a nice presence. I wish it had an adorned crown but the plain crown does match well with the utilitarian design.This will definitely be a new work horse for me and with the screw down crown brushed steel case and sapphire crystal it should last a while.
