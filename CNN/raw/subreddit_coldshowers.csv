1027122,0,t3_25uwpv,Im a couple weeks in still cold. But maybe thats just because I like wearing my jacket...Though I noticed that the water doesnt bother me as much.,coldshowers,chl1g3w,1,t5_2t389

2877733,0,t3_2rkepi,This is normal. Its called the after drop. It will become easier especially if you focus on your breathing in the time around and during the cold shower. ,coldshowers,cnv77cw,1,t5_2t389
3043834,0,t3_2uzy4a,It shouldnt be painful just uncomfortably cold.Ever been to the beach? You know the ocean and those outdoor showers? Thats roughly how cold it should be.Granted its winter right now so your water might be colder than it normally would.If its physically painful make it a bit warmer. The idea is to be uncomfortable and get the urge to turn it warm. Not kill yourself.,coldshowers,codhqv3,2,t5_2t389
3480712,0,t1_cpomzde,Sounds good thanks.I will start in three showers. Each one more cold and the fourth  cold.,coldshowers,cpp0yc1,1,t5_2t389
4260620,0,t1_cs5azy2,Well yeah. Reading this subreddit was the most useless thing Ive ever done. And also the fact that I had pneumonia is definitely not related to cold showering. I just got pneumonia in the middle of the summer which by the way I never had in my life because its the most popular time to catch it. Especially for a person who havent got sick in years.,coldshowers,cs5w2xt,-8,t5_2t389

6741922,0,t3_46pj7c,i usually start laughing after a few minutes under the water because the ridiculousness of choosing cold water is absolutely hilarious. i think its a natural expression of whatever chemical cocktail your body releases as a response to cold water shock.,coldshowers,d0go7ul,1,t5_2t389
6815157,0,t1_d0osgus,Yeah absolutely. I actually enjoy the winter showers more when the water is properly cold. Somehow feels more satisfying than when it is C outside,coldshowers,d0osnas,2,t5_2t389

8386232,0,t3_4ugs06,You dont need to go colder than F .C for most of the time everyday showers. Its a law of diminishing returns to go any colder than that every single day although occasionally is fine just to test your mettle.F.C feels way colder than it sounds. Water is different than air.Get a meat thermometer and figure out the sweet spot on your water dial for wintertime.,coldshowers,d5pts45,1,t5_2t389
8991991,0,t1_d7rf8hj,I started like that. A couple of thoughts cold water does not wash off shampoo and conditioner very well. Second contrasting hotcold shower feels so much better for the skin and body than just cold.,coldshowers,d7sp5u2,1,t5_2t389
9761256,0,t1_dag63k1,gt Did your perception of temperature in the showeroutside change over the yearOh god yes.Cold showers dont bother me really anymore. I dont hyperventilate when the shower hits me so my body has adapted to a colder temperature.It helps me with these midwest winters well temperaturewise... the snow still sucks ass so shoveling out snow is a little bit less of a chore. Little bit.,coldshowers,dagajkm,2,t5_2t389
9817912,0,t3_5fui24,Really a personal call based on how your feeling. For me if its just a cold then Ill usually be fine with keeping it a cold shower but it also just depends on how severe it is. I wouldnt push yourself too much because cold showers do test your immune system and you dont want to make things worse. Really just depends on how you feel how severe it is. ,coldshowers,danaj8f,4,t5_2t389
9992101,0,t1_db9fpga,No prob. Did you take one? I had one this morning still  out.,coldshowers,db9zyqd,1,t5_2t389
10357551,0,t3_5o8bpv,Personally cold showers make me able to fall asleep better. Feels so good to get in the nice warm bed and my whole body is slightly numb from the cold water.,coldshowers,dci37na,2,t5_2t389

11091048,0,t3_5yders,I dont really see this having much benefit but its not going to hurt to try. If you can figure out a way to have an ice bath you might have better results.,coldshowers,dep5sn5,1,t5_2t389
11233777,0,t1_df5bsu6,Not Toronto. I take my cold showers as cold as I can without feeling that needles are in my skin. I do go red a bit but not purple. Being purple is bad and a sign that your bloodflow is not good. I dont want to risk having issues with my penis because I take cold showers. The point here is discipline not pain. If your cold shower makes you shiver scream and want to leave ASAP you are doing it right. If your cold shower hurts your body permanently then you are doing it wrong. ,coldshowers,df5c0d9,2,t5_2t389

11251373,0,t3_603hb2,I think so in a way at least.  I dont take cold showers to generate motivation I take them for reasons that are part of a broader do difficult things approach to life.  But I do generally find that I drink less coffee and carry more motivation and energy into work than days I skip a shower. Every accomplishment throughout the day feels a bit better knowing that not only did I accomplish something but I did it and started the day off the polar bear way.,coldshowers,df7brmy,3,t5_2t389

11488620,0,t3_63uk4q,Ive got long hair so I dont always want to get it wet.  So I do the same thing occasionally without issue.  Just be sure to get your head in there from time to time to build that tolerance the brain freezes only last a brief period before they stop happening.,coldshowers,dfy8feb,1,t5_2t389
