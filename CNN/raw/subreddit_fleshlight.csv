2509117,0,t3_2ocxq1,Theres nothing painful about it and it just has a firm grip when you use it.  Besides that its a total vacuum machine its that good really and probably one of the better purchases available from fleshlight.  The only problem Ive had is that it takes time to get a feel of it. It took me a few uses from it to start feeling all the bumps and pieces inside of it which are really the selling point. But thats hardly the toys fault.     Two other things you should know is that its a little more difficult to clean it just because of the texture and it uses a lot more lube than normal.,fleshlight,cmm2vua,5,t5_2qpg7

3206494,0,t1_cosir8f,According to the fleshlight renewing powder guide you can just leave it on til the next time you use it. If youre still getting tackinessstickiness try repeating the cornstarch process several times before using it again until it feels like new again. I have a fleshlight flight pilot so Im not sure what the others feel like new but mine was pretty smooth.,fleshlight,couconz,1,t5_2qpg7
3248607,0,t1_coyp76b,Are there any particular replacements that this r knows of?I never said that I didnt need lube. I need replacements before the shipping gets here. Besides that is the shower a legitimate replacement for lube in my case?,fleshlight,coyq68g,-2,t5_2qpg7
3255565,0,t3_2xbjk7,Hmm...yeah pause on that shower commentyou dont want to use soap on in or with the Fleshlight. Soap degrades the material. Maybe thats not what cockboy was alluding to but just wanted to make sure that was clear.  Are you just asking what sort of lubes other than the Fleshlight branded lubes you could use? If so the Fleshlube branded lube is just a Fleshlight private label waterbased lube. Its a great lube but its not particularly special. Any number of the popular waterbased personal lubricants available in the family planning section of your corner Walgreens CVS Target WalMart or even grocery store will work great. Just make sure its water based.    The KY Ultragel is greata little pricey but great and available all over the place.    Astroglide is another one that is available at most places. This one gets a little sticky for me after a while but itll do.   I didnt start trying the Fleshlight brand lube until recently. It has become our favorite allaround lube as of late but before that Id just pick up some KY Ultragel at the grocery store...just slip it in among the toothpaste hamburger meat and breadthe cute checkout girl will never notice right?  Actually I live near a large university and the lube sells out quick. If you go too late on a Saturday night youre lucky if theres anything left its kind of funny.    Anyway is that what you were asking for?,fleshlight,cozg7nn,4,t5_2qpg7
4324717,0,t3_3aiw4i,I keep it at the back of my underwear drawer. I figure thats a decent offlimits place for most people. If someone is close enough to me to be messing around in my underwear drawer theyre close enough to me to know about the Fleshlight. My SO knows about it but I still keep it mostly hidden and out of site anyway because I dont want random people or friends or family dropping by and seeing it of course. What type of activity are you hoping to see more of here? Or perhaps post something for us to talk about...,fleshlight,csd4hn4,3,t5_2qpg7

5858529,0,t1_cxnkr4w,Youre not the first person to mention the sticky material to me. I was looking at the pilot mainly as Id be able to reach the whole texture.

5932672,0,t1_cxq919f,Actually I would say it is GO SURGE. The one on the left was my first Go Surge and the second rotated a bit was a replacement by ILF after the first was damaged thank you customer service!. Both have the same code including the same placement of a dot indent before the G in GO and after the E in SURGE. Id say the dot means the code is starts and ends there. So starting at GO and ending at SURGE makes more sense  GO SURGE. edit Or I could be wrong and the dot is a space between words like SURGE  GO. See if the dot is on other sleeves with two worded codes and decide which is more likely. Both of these came from the Texas distributor if youre wondering. ,fleshlight,cxxay1c,2,t5_2qpg7

6242185,0,t1_cyz5512,Just to clarify are you saying the inside of the case the part that touches the outer portion of the sleeve feels greasy to the touch?  Or are saying the outside of the case the part that would come in contact with your hand feels greasy?  If its the outside I would wash it with some mild dish soap and rinse thoroughly before letting it dry overnight. Then rinsing again before use.  If you are talking about the inside of the case it is probably coming from the lubricated sleeve. Are you using a waterbased lube?,fleshlight,cyz62ok,1,t5_2qpg7

6402728,0,t3_43chwr,. Oldest one is about two years old now rest being  and a half to  year old.. Oldest has a tiny tear on the orifice by stretching it too much while cleaning. Apart from that looks great. My alien sleeve that is about  years old has lost a bit of the blue coloring.. Never. As long as you clean them properly and dry them accordingly there should be no serious deterioration well definitely not enough to call them worn out and unusable.Hope that helps.,fleshlight,czhfbmt,1,t5_2qpg7

Again no experience with the Girls line but they are the same quality as the regular Fleshlights which is excellent. ,fleshlight,d3v6zxj,1,t5_2qpg7

8100713,0,t1_d44rybe,Make an O with your finger. Move it up and down your penis. Thats anal sex.The sphincter is generally tighter than a pussy. The rectum itself is not really tight. There is no muscle there. Its warm you get a bit of stimulation but for the most part its a looser nothingness with most of the stimulation coming from the sphincter first I dunno inch of her ass.So no the fleshlight probably doesnt feel like anal,fleshlight,d4qld2r,1,t5_2qpg7
8200697,0,t1_d52jfb8,Yes to the hand touch they are definitely stickier and cooler to the touch initially. Once you get oiled and going neither of those are a problem.,fleshlight,d52n2x7,1,t5_2qpg7

If you are bigger than me girth wise Im sure you will love the Fleshlight Go. Its smaller than the regular version but its also cheaper. And even though its smaller doesnt mean its small. Its just not ridiculously large like the original version and you wont be paying for extra space you wont ever feel. That being said the Go was my first fleshlight. ,fleshlight,dagq3om,2,t5_2qpg7
