8264595,0,t3_4r59qi,Hi Hummingbirds!F recently separated and recovering alcoholic.  Growing up and in my twenties I was always athletic and my social activities always centered around sports for a while I was running marathons.  When I got involved with my ex I started drinking more exercising less and generally all of my bad life habits started taking over the good ones.  Fast forward five years and Im overweight drinking everyday few friends in a job that I dislike and a place I hate.  Sobriety was my first step and I have learned that the allatonce life overhaul method doesnt work for me.  I prioritized getting clean ate lots of cookies and am deeply proud of my success in that area thus far  months!.  The next step was the relationship and living situation.  We separated and I put plans in motion to move back across the country where I want to be.  I move next week.  Its a huge risk careerwise because Im trading job security and a surething for quality of life but its the right choice for me.Now Im ready to address my weight and nutrition.  I started logging calories and using mfp last week lost  lbs of water weight in  days that was surprising.  My goal is to lose  pounds in these  weeks which will put me into the normal range of BMI.  The next step will be integrating exercise.   Im glad to be here and happy to be a hummingbird!,TeamHummingbird,d5amra4,2,t5_3f9ll
