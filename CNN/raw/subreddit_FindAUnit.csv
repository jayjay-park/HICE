3066059,0,t1_cofs7lx,Unfortunately I dont. Were aiming for those numbers but right now were sitting at  with roughly  on average for our Tuesday and Sunday sessions.We say battalion because thats what our level in the TAW structure is called. Heres how it works in case you wonder but feel free to skip if not.  The Art of Warfare is a  member strong gaming community playing about  different games. Each game has their own leaders and each member belongs to one game.Aside from a few purely admin positions almost all of our members are playing one or more games. These nonsupport staff members consistute the TAW Army. The army is divided into  Corps each managing about  games. Each game is a Division. Since its an international community we then divide further into Battalions one for each general timezone needed. For the Arma division nd battalion are all the europeans and any other people who prefer the euro evening timeslots over the US ones. Its pretty indepth but nothing a normal member need to worry too much about. Thats for the higherups to mess with.  As an example the full designation of the squad Im currently a member of would be  TAW  TAW Army  th Corps  Arma Division  nd Battalion  rd Platoon  Echo Squad the Expendables.  Easy to remember eh? None of our members would ever actually use that. Theyd just call us Expendables Squad because our Battalion is the only part of TAW they see on a daily basis.Although its kinda rare we sometimes hold division wide events where we find a time both the US folks and us in the EU unit can play together. In theory those could be  players our current total. In theory. We are currently on a recruiting drive and our aim is to reach  fairly soon. Thats about . full platoons so I suppose we could call ourselves a battalion by in game size as well by then.Regarding only playing on Saturdays that would mean you cant be a proper member of TAW since we require that you attend at least  of the main events the Tuesdays and Sundays ones. That said we always welcome guests to join us whenever as long as they behave. ,FindAUnit,cofsl56,1,t5_2wxui

I think that our small but actively growing group may be a good fit for you  and I would be happy to discuss it further with you either in Teamspeak or via PM.Below is my copy paste for my advertisement here in rfindaunit  but it gives a strong indication of what kind of group Sons of Odin is. Please do bear in mind that we are working on expanding our Arma presence but we do usually get two or more PvP op nights in a week. Furthermore we have plans on buildingrenting a server for CoOp operations in the coming months.The Sons of Odin can best be described as a casualhardcore group meaning that we are all hardcore gamers with a more casual approach to gaming.  We dont require people to play every day we dont require people to invest massive amounts of time in to the games we play and we dont require people to put their real lives on hold to make it into a game  nights per week.  We live by the code that real life comes first.That being said when we are together we go hard.  Whether it is training practice or actual operation we give   of the time and we expect all of our members to commit to putting in the work when they are inworld.  In return we give our members  commitment to making sure they are trained equipped and ready to do battle in whatever form that takes.Here are some qualities we look for in members    The ability to learn new skills and tactics    A willingness to put those abilities and tactics to use    A strong commitment to personal excellence    An even stronger commitment to group unity and success    A sense of fair play and honor    A sense of community    A sense of loyalty    Unwavering respect for others    A commitment to the betterment of the team    A willingness to follow orders    A willingness to respect the chain of commandWhat we are NOT looking for is    Cockiness    Arrogance    I dont need to to train because I have a  KDR    Cheaters    Hackers    Griefers    Racists    Whiners    Faction  Clan jumpers    Glory hounds  RambosSons of Odin has three levels of membership to ensure that every player finds what they are looking for  however I think the highest level one is what you are looking forSOG Member  Extensive application and evaluation process minimum age of  extensive training requiredIf this is a little too intense for you then standard Full SoO membership is available as well  there is an application process associated with joining SoO in a nonSOG manner but significantly less training required and no evaluation.Sons of Odin focuses primarily on Team vs Team and PvP combat.Sons of Odin is an international gaming community  however Arma operations are primarily US time zone friendlyFor more information please see www.soogaming.com or reach out to me via PM for teamspeak information.Feel free to contact any of the following individuals on our forums to gain additional information about our groupTerraphon Rob NordicTiger Tiskahar InfandusNOTE SoO is a multigame community with a strong presence in ArmaTeamspeak is required for all levels of membershipPlease feel free to post in this thread or PM me with any questions or concerns you may have.Thank youValhalla awaitsInfandus  SOG Sr NCO ,FindAUnit,coonqkx,1,t5_2wxui

We at Signal dont run a milsim community what we do is more along the lines of casual realism. What that means is that we dont run ranks or training but instead we focus on getting into the experiences of what ArmA can offer. We still use structure similar to that you would see in other units but when it comes to the individual positions inside the unit no one is limited to a certain role. So you could find yourself playing as an infantry AT one mission and next you could find yourself flying high above the battlefield.

We are a casual group of people that take part in realism style missions but it isnt overstructured to the point where its tedious to play. We do also have a couple of other people that are unable to use their mics for certain aspects of the game so you not being able to use you mic for a while will not be an issue. Our events run at PM EST on Friday nights so hopefully that doesnt conflict too much with your schedule.

7504818,0,t3_4i58wl,Who Are WeThe nd nightstalkers is responsible for numerous public operations that you may see floating around the Bohemia forums and Reddit including Operation Circuit Breaker Operation Direct Current and Operation Boiler Plate. We look towards realism in game play but completely eschew the nonsensical Sir Yes Sir! and general jawflapping regarding rank and anything outside of game play. The people who wear rank wear it because missions have to be made people have to be taught to play and work as a team and assets like the website and servers have to be maintained. These people who wear rank are experienced leaders and technicians who just want to have fun like the rest of us but put in the extra work to make sure that the group can thrive.Our MissionOur mod pack is very light only whats necessary to achieve what we need on a regular basis. The idea is to enhance game play not to bog down your hard drive with the weight of a million assets that are never used. Our missions are challenging and spartan requiring that you rely on your team work and skill in order to succeed. Were not the elite SF group that rolls out with thermal scopes. Were the under supplied grunts who glorify the grit doing battle in the darkness from our muddy trucks and through our rusted iron sights and foggy binoculars under the evil glitter of  night flares that couldnt last long enough. Our AI is tough. Theyve been given the teeth to utterly destroy you and we ensure that they are first as close to human as we can make them before giving them all the equipment that we didnt bother to take just to make it fair.We are not an experience for everyone but everyone who joins the nd meets a group of friends that has endured for years. Even if youre shaky and just booting up ArmA  for the first time well get you rocking and dropping targets with your iron sights and plain binoculars before you know it. Weve seen each other through university and deployments so if youve got to take time off to go we understand and will see you on the other end. Right now our time is your time and there are numerous operations during the week so youre bound to find something.

For security simply make sure that your team keeps all of their sectors covered. No blind spots. Maneuvering in a danger area is a lot about security but also to utilize bounding good breaching and above all consistent comms between your members. And when you take contact depending on the situation a good idea is always to first take cover second return suppressing fire fix them in position flank them and finish them off.

We prefer to adapt to the mission rather than making a mission fit the group this is most obvious in our structure. We dont have a big rank structure or set roles. Instead we use a couple ranks for lack of a better word that determine priority on role selection for that mission.ampnbspWe dont have assigned roles so there is no designated pilots or squad leaders which would hinder the unit in making missions. Sometimes a mission maker cant build a mission the way it should be done when they are forced to incorporate a spot for a jet or helicopter pilot when a unit has assigned roles. Ive seen a wider variety of missions in the past  months than my previous  years in arma combined.ampnbspWe run a weekly mission night every Saturday at pm EST which is sometimes one long mission other weeks its several shorter missions. We dont have any other designated days for Arma. Almost everyone hops on other games with each other during the week though. Sometimes thats Rainbow Six Siege Overwatch Total War WARHAMMER or a public arma server running Exile or Wasteland. Most of us have been playing for several years in large organized units that had too much bureaucracy so we created AmTac to play the way we wanted when we wanted.ampnbspIf Amtac interests you add me on Steam or find me in our TeamSpeakampnbspAddress ts.amateurtactical.comPassword RT,FindAUnit,d4k2ex0,1,t5_2wxui
