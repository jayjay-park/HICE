6695951,0,t3_46tk3t,Glad to see so many feeling the same as I. I saw someone comment that emails were being fwd to the guys and maybe not being addressed by TSM themselves  unfortunately this may be true. I sent similar Email below and got kind of generic boilerplate sorry fwd to the guys hope you keep listening email. Situation really sucks.Email I sent  posting here so I know someone at least took the time to readRussI know this past week has probably been crazy and I hope you have time to read this email or at least pass along to the right party. This is not intended to bash anyone or be negative in anyways it is simply a chance for me to voice my displeasure and concern  I have with something I love and hopefully sway a decision that I believe was made in error.First I need to say I am assuming that the root cause of this was bigger than the  incident. My guess is that there has been growing concern in the past of Zane alienating people or businesses and that this last issue was enough for this decision to be made. Im sure a lot of talking and thinking went into this before deciding it was best to part ways. I fear however it was based solely on this growing concern and may not have given consideration of . who Zane really is . what he is capable of changing and ultimately . what affect it would have for the FBHW show down the road.. Im not going to go into a lot of detail Who Zane really is He has a Radio Show personality of jerk popoff guy and a very different Outside the Show personality that is caring and opposite of Radio. I know it many listeners know that and believe you already know that too. What I wanted to do however is point out something that stems  from this statement that should be considered. Zane developed a radio show personality around what worked for him long ago. This personality took the shape of an on the edge  insulting  jerk type and hes been successful that way. Right or wrong it worked for him and hes built his career on that approach. When FBHW started this continued and he had Jerk  Spice job responsibilities related to the job  that was his role. Again Right or Wrong this is what it is  he had job responsibilities to be this way maybe not for management  but for the listeners and growing success of the show. Now on the outside of radio side you have someone who has matured greatly and has developed into a very positive influence for people and community  odd as that is. The AT childrens project  the countless people who Zane has led to better themselves workout lose weight etc. The person he is outside of radio is totally positive and as such conflicts greatly with the radio personality he has had responsibility to maintain. He has more of a split personality situation than anyone on the show and as you may only get to deal with the radio personality I dont want the other personality to be overlooked in all of this for the radio show one is a character and this other personality is true Zane and as such capable and mature enough to adjust to conditions. Which leads me into. Being capable of change. I dont know what type of limit management wants for Zane but I know that this probably has been a touchy point. The Radio personality he brings to the show has been key to the success of the show but I know that the personality is also one management probably would prefer to not see  or at least limited somehow. I think the listeners get it he pokes fun at situations exaggerating at times for the entertainment value but ultimately it is just entertainment and not taken literally. But I understand why management would be concerned on this especially when his radio personality rolls with a story exaggerates it to entertain and crosses a line management has the right to be upset on. Management should not have to deal with firestorms ill caused by someone popping off a story that alienates people andor businesses. That is an unnecessary risk and issue I understand management has a right to voice and modify. I think deciding to terminate was the wrong way to address however for I truly believe he can and will change or adjust as management sees fit  whether keeping from these topics in the future or simply cleaning up the dirty angle he takes on anything. He is not dumb  he gets why reigns need to be in place on his radio personality the struggle I am sure hes always felt is how to walk that very thin line of performing his jerk role  edgy job responsibility that has contributed to the shows success on one side while not pushing it so far that it is goes unacceptably over the edge  and sometimes you fail walking that line. The point is this  He has had this internal to the guys responsibility on the show and perhaps management experienced his radio personality when dealing with this in the past but I know real Zane is a mature person and more than capable dialing it back as needed to accommodate the better good for the show overall. After what hes dealt with the last few weeks you tell me hes not willing or capable to listen and adjust. On air he is a character  and that character can be adjusted as needed as the actor playing the character is more than capable based on who he is in real life.. What affect this has on the success of the show  this is what concerns me the most. I have been a podcaster on the show for  years  I have listened to every podcast since I started  hence I understand the show intimately and know what Im talking about. Youve heard it before the show is built on talking and the dynamic between the guys  and that is what makes the show work. There is a very important delicate dynamic that exists between the guys that makes the show so entertaining and popular. Zanes departure and the attempt to supplement the void with Joe  Steve is not working. And although you can get by for a day  week this way it will not sustain the show on the long term. It is a delicate dynamic that existed and with Zane not there a wheel is missing from the car and it cannot drive forward efficiently at all. The show is just OK   it is not great anymore. That is my biggest concern  as I love this show dearly and fear without Zane it will deteriorate  lose interest by listeners  and ultimately be dissolved away over the course of time. I have waited a week to write this as I wanted to make sure I observed what I feared before I wrote it down. Unfortunately that is what I see and what I hear from others. The danger in all of this is that Zane departure ultimately will hurt the bottom line of TSM  as the show slowly declines away. I have a few months left on my podcast before renewal I may renew at that time if the quality of the current show gets better but I do not think I will unless Zane returns  and fear having to ride into the sunset away from FBHW. And that is also the word on the street from others  everyone is supporting both Zane and the show right now but the word is it is not entertaining like it was  people will leave as a result.So obviously I would love to see Zane back and hope there is something behind the scenes being worked on. I dont know if this letter does anything to help change feelings or decisions  perhaps I could of kept it short with bring back Zane and left it at that  but I feel passionate about this and truly think this decision was not the right decision. Talk to him  work something out  get him back in the saddle before it is too late. Please do this. He has incredible public support right now  take advantage of it. Get him back and make the public happy  and while the public celebrates TSM and him can openly discuss any adjustments needed behind the scenes out of public view. Thats a winwinwin  Public happy show succeeds and TSM gets undivided attentions by Zane to their concerns and needs going forward. Give him a chance to show you  hes never been more willing than now.Russ I thank you for your time reading. I am only guessing at why the decision was made so I hope this letter is close to hitting it and does something to at least provide a moment to reconsider the situation and the best way to move forward. If you have anything to add or have a need for more feedback let me know. Thanks  and hoping for the best.,fbhw,d0bx3sj,1,t5_2svpm

I doubt at this point they think about him that much minute to minute on the show.  Picture it this way If Zane was just out sick or on vacation do you think the interaction could have taken place the way it did? I do.

7178047,0,t3_4drh7v,Ive also been an Albany listener since day one. Truthfully I was never even a huge Zane fan per se. I didnt have an issue with him I was just indifferent.Since this whole thing has gone down Ive been watching his videos and I really feel like hes either changed or a lot of what he did was shtick. I feel like Ive seen the real guy now and I really liked him. Similarly a few times FBHW have made comments that seemed to me to be off handed subversive jabs at EZ and its changed my opinions of them too. Maybe they werent jabs but thats just how they felt to me.I listen to FBHW occasionally these days for other reasons and now that Zane is back on the air I think Im more likely to listen to his streampodcast than the others. Either way its a sad day for the show.,fbhw,d1u2uoa,4,t5_2svpm
