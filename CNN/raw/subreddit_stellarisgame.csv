6982059,0,t1_d17qtri,Yeah I never really have any interest in schemes behind the screen like what happened but I subscribed here straight away. I have faith that the mod team will deliver the same pleasant experience Ive had on other paradox subs and have timely updates on new developer diaries and the likes.Good luck mate.,stellarisgame,d17r7dv,7,t5_39fj2
6988567,0,t1_d18hcpu,aw crap now I look like a weeb,stellarisgame,d18huf2,7,t5_39fj2
6992334,0,t1_d18wsv7,True which is why I am so happy they added a make everyone the same FTL just so I can also play as if this was a Sins of a Solar Empire game on a grander scale.I am going to reserve criticism of any of the FTLs until we can play. I doubt the devs would make one clearly superior to the others so that no one will want to play the other two.  I would bet each has its advantages and disadvantages.And honestly I rather have lanes than the wormhole that one sounds fun but less useful.,stellarisgame,d18x9ck,6,t5_39fj2

6999907,0,t1_d19dd55,I was thinking more of the catastrophe being the leading up to it rather than it happening.The event firing would just be instant game over.,stellarisgame,d19s7mh,2,t5_39fj2
7004170,1,t3_4blniu,Everything here that isnt already part of the game requires ck numbers of characters or more.Kid if you cared about politics in this game youd bother to do more than read the government names.,stellarisgame,d1a9mqg,2,t5_39fj2
7007174,0,t1_d1ac3xd,I dont see much of a connection between the AI personalities and the prospect of unlocking government types not available at the start of the game.,stellarisgame,d1alwrb,4,t5_39fj2

7019129,0,t3_4bs69s,They also said that the different types of habitable planets are more or less equally likely to show up though arid might have a slight advantage.,stellarisgame,d1byuvh,10,t5_39fj2

7026006,0,t1_d1c6w5u,That bothered me a little in the stream today. I mean I can suspend my disbelief for the scifi stuff but  or  different spacefaring species within a galactic equivalent of arms length away. Maybe Im just scaling it wrong in my head but it seems pretty dern sure close to me.,stellarisgame,d1cr1kp,2,t5_39fj2
