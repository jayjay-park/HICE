2320832,0,t3_2lujr0,I recently started an armor soldier on allies and I think their starting tanks are equally poor.  I found that direct engagements with enemy armor were almost entirely suicidal even after upgrading to a stuart.  Almost all light tank engagements are decided by surprise or the first shot.  If you can get into a good firing position to hit flank armor on passing vehicles or find a route to bypass covered firing lanes and flank positions you can easily score double and triple tank kills even with the AP machine gun ammo.  Try and make sure that you dont give away the element of surprise till you can guarantee you can cover their escape routes.The starter tanks are more effective against foot soldiers though.  If you can avoid enemy armor and pick off troops at m you can expect to live much longer.,HeroesandGenerals,clykhgm,2,t5_2tnq5

3698968,0,t3_32rafh,Try to convince a infantry player  extra hand to run the gun with you. Double the firepower  double the winning. Promote synergy like a boss. Offer rides to cap points. You can singlehandedly carry two infantry to a cap point and they can gun while you move all while you get sweet chauffeur points and tank driving skill.The LEE is awesome and you have yet to realize its trolling power. For example   When there is an infantry humping you without anti tank and you are alone switch seats. To the third machine gun. Sweep. A. It makes the infantry think you LEFT your tank to kill him thus panicing so he can kill you and take your sweet sweet ride. B. They will be too focused looking for your person. C. They cant steal your tank while your in it. D. Most know not of the gun on top but they will keep eyes on your secondary turret. E. It turns the tank OFF.Also shoot every damn enemy jeep civilian vehicle anti air gun you can get your hands on. Empty jeeps? thats  extra points  if vet experience. Yes the empty ones.

3785581,0,t1_cqnowqz,oh okay thanks for clearing that up.But i do think the PTRD vs. Panzershreck cost difference is too vast to say that they even out. One rocket that may not even hit the target costs about  times more than a single PTRD round x coming from the best estimates of the ammo costs for both weapons that i could find online. The cost makes the  panzershreck extremely impractical going one round and only killing a handful of tanks and youll still be out  credits. I understand that the cost is made to be a deterrent to prevent everyone and their grandma from carrying them around but after logging  hours into HampG ive still only seen them in probably less than  games. Being able to kill infantry tanks jeeps and even planes without going broke gives the PTRD a clear advantage to me.,HeroesandGenerals,cqnsavm,1,t5_2tnq5

4013697,0,t3_36cjcm,Personally I think that the purchasing price of the launcher is fine. Id prefer for the launchers themselves to not go up in price. I think they are in a sweet spot that makes them accessible to any player regardless of whether or not they are a veteran. k is a fantastic price for such a desirable weapon considering what some of the prices in this game are.The ammunition on the other hand definitely needs to drop. The wiki says that its  credits a shot.  credits a shot is pretty crazy especially considering that one shot probably wont get the job done for most players. As a nonveteran player that consistently gets around   k per match the price just isnt feasible. That means that in an assault match where the launchers are most valuable I might get off  shots in a thirty minute or longer game and then I lose any profit. Any more than that and Im dipping into my savings.In all the time I have owned the bazooka and the panzerschreck on my character Ive felt prepared to loose savings maybe twice. Its cheaper to do an allgrenade loadout than it is doing a conventional antiarmor run with either of the launchers. Im talking one grenade type from each faction Dynamite Lover and emptying your supplies each run. Absurd amounts of grenades thrown. I think that is a bit out there.I am definitely in favor of the refill cost of the launchers going down. I feel like a large part of the community probably feel like I do seeing the launcher as a weapon that is kind of taboo or barred from use just from a price standpoint. They arent worth using. Twice Ive used them just out of sheer frustration. Despite not being veteran I am an active member in these games. Close to  hours logged all on one character.

4182614,0,t3_38nr3b,As someone who has over  hours in the game i just wanted to address some of the points made by op. Much of my experience unlocking and playing through the lower ranks of hampg is from a while ago when it was much easier to rank up through a ribbon. Currently i have  main soldiers one of each faction. My main loadout is ohk boltaction mines and stickies. I started as german so he is my highest rank halfway into becoming the first rank of general. Just on him i would say that i have about  hours but not focusing on unlocking everything. He has silver in most infantry ribbons and gold in a few. I can easily say that if you wanted to just max out every infantry ribbon with all the gun types before  hours sounds about right. But that  hours is spent simply grinding with no enjoyment and being basically no help to your team. Expect full days of driving in circles to level the driving ribbon and more days riding a bike in circles off in some hidden corner to lvl up for heavyset. To do this now would take well over  hours. Oh and this is for just one character. Try to get one of each faction and well.. Good luck. No AVERAGE player is going to spend this amount of time. Just not gonna happen.As for costs.. This is something that used to be much better. While rockets and sticky prices have largely stayed the same they have never really phased me much but only because i use mines to avoid the cost. I lose utility as a price to save money. Heres where i think things make it really bad. YOU LOSE MONEY IF YOU USE THESE WEAPONS CORRECTLY. Take out a tank with rockets and no missed shots? Good job that cost you more money than you made for that kill. Sure it helps the team but thats a different issue. Nowhere is this more true than tripmines. Things just eat money. But lets talk about Mods. These used to be fairly priced untill about  builds ago. With the revamp of weapon mods costs to repair have spiraled out of control. A fully modded bolt action will run you about  credits or more in a standard game for repairs. This isnt a big deal when at higher ranks your making k credits a game but tack on rockets and other costs it can cost you more than you made for a match. Its even worse using modded subs and mgs. Snipers are some of the worst ive seen for cost per shot but not on rocket level.Not sure how to fix this as guns already cost a ton just to buy them. I do think they ever should have raised repair costs.When i comes to war... Well really with wars ending every other day or so i see no point whatsoever. Soviets were a huge mistake i think. Dividing an already smallish player base into more parts just well hasnt worked for the wars. Currently there is no way to fix the balance and no reward to even play war battles other than the games tend to be slightly longer when its not k against .The youtube comment was spot on every game i saw was rife with teamkilling but actually games i play dont seem to be that bad. Could just be that is what they thought people wanted to see and what the big name attracted. Not sure but def not good press in my mind.As for subs and money ive never put a dime into the game and well i really have no intent on it. Want to lessen the grind? Its gonna cost ya. Is it hurting the players? Hell fucking yes it is. For real though non sub players like me can be and do play very well in the game. Is it hard and take a lot of time yes. At this point i feel the need to stick to only my builds that i have already as the tome it would take to change is just much to long now. Every change that ive seen since the game came to steam has been to increase the grind none to lower it. Is it a better game now? Not really its about the same. But lets all be honest the whole goal is to have people that arnt high level and havent put money into the game for those that have to shoot. A high rank player with money money better guns and higher ribbons is going to win most fights. Its gonna take a long time for a new player to get to that point or money to get you on the same playing field. The game isnt play to winoutside having a nd medal but god damn if not paying hurts after a while..,HeroesandGenerals,crx0rut,2,t5_2tnq5
4183502,0,t3_38o9ny,I asked for a refund on my academy general because I felt the inability to go back and earn the chauffeur ribbons an essential commander badge as a soldier much much much faster was borderline greasy. Generals didnt used to have badges so academytrained generals werent a liability and didnt carry the negatives that purchasing an academytrained soldier had. That was a precedent set in over a VERY long time of gaming.Naturally Ive been told wordforwordgtWe never claimed that an AcademyTrained General would be exactly the same as a General that was levelled up from scratch.So it doesnt really matter that they completely changed the powerpotential of an item that costs about  bucks in the game because they never said it wouldnt happen. Who cares that they already set a precedent for only soldiers suffering from that limitation because they never openly stated it wouldnt happen.So me a solid supporter financially and morally has been punished for spending money on the game. You heard that right paying for something in the game is actually paytolose right now. I cant be the only one fuming about an academytrained general purchase.So learn from mea player with hundreds of hours and dollars spent on the gameReto doesnt care that theyre punishing you for supporting their game as long as they never said they wouldnt do it.I guess theres a silver lining though as this was also part of the support ticketgtHowever we will be adding more possibilities for AcademyTrained Generals to unlock combat badges in the future.Which Im sure most of the veterans know what that means.

5216509,0,t1_cvepwba,Not crying just attempting to understand why it would be permitted by Reto when it sucks the fun out OF the game. People dont play this way for fun they do so for XP. Reto has banned people for riding a bicycle around to grind for heavy SET how is this much different EDIT this was meant to say riding around in circles but either way i was mistaken. The  hours is how much I have played which you said IS less THAN the AMOUNT of TIME you have spent in matches like the ones I am talking about farming other players. Also you want me to provide evidence for a game I played with you  weeks ago despite not knowing I was going to make this post much LESS have you respond to it. That doesnt seem a little odd to you? I remember you because you are A good player I had played with you before and you have a unique name I had seen on the the SUBREDDIT. I play under the name WalterSbchak I responded to you in chat about not farming them. Perhaps that will help you remember. Perhaps not we didnt speak after my comment.How was my analogy completely irrational? Two teams acting outside the spirit of the game to garner more experience. The only difference between farming and an aimbot is you have to download an aimbot. The end result is still the same XP you did not truly earn.If someone leaves the match they forfeit the bonus creds for staying in a match to the end. Credits they would get if the opposing side had not postponed the end of the match to get XP.,HeroesandGenerals,cves5li,1,t5_2tnq5

Assault rifles just outperform those  group of weapons so hard my mp is just a joke now.scopes on soldiers? great idea so why do we exactly have recons again? havin a x scope doesnt make up for havin  slots no cars or APCS spawns limited by Assault teams. the only good thing is the reconcar but Mechanized Recon ATs are rare.thats not even the worst. scopes turned some maps into camperfests. the game became noticable slower and its harder or even impossible to fight closer. id rather outmaneuver enemies between houses than set up a tent and camp around till someone is trapped in my crosshair but you basically have to have a scope or you are fucked when the enemy can see you already and you cannot. and because it is not limited to BA kiddin me? everyone has a scope now well except LMGSMG users and i guess you can see now why those  groups underperform so hard.okay this game is not hyper realistic but WW was not BF with lasers and zoom on every shit. scopes were rare and expensive compared to basic weapons. but at least if you pull shit like that give everyone x. or x and NOT different zoom levels up to x.....,HeroesandGenerals,cvkj3pp,5,t5_2tnq5

I say this with a strong education and  years experience in business tactics and product development. . Im all good with those suggestions. Im happy to concede that enough of the community felt that the original limitations on Recons was unbalanced hence why I mentioned bipods. Your suggestion to make them an accessory to effect the ability to carry a pistol is justified.. Nah sorry its just plane broken on most terrain.. Going to be and actually fixed... different things...hence the gripe.. We can only hope all my bitching will pay off.. Good attitudes to deal with this one thanks.. I see you feel my pain. It traps new players. For those of us who started in the game early when there was little help from experienced vets getting an SMG was a big deal. After buying this thing you finally realize how shit it is. Hence it needs work to make it fit in the game against the Carbine etc.. Fair call but it still shits me. I dont play CS or Cod because of the communities. There have been plenty of suggestions for better team play including tips and posters. The devs have highlighted their like for these suggestions but at current the negative effects of these players still taint the game hence its inclusion.. Happy to.

So while a recon has a bit more damage on heavyset than infantry they have to do so even closer to the action without having an SMG for CQC like infantrecon can have.Oh and when you die those sniper hunters dont get your sniper rifle. They get the SMG which is arguably a much better alternative. Strangely enough thats the main reason why I LOVE playing my Soviet infantrecon.

6451923,0,t3_43w6mv,I have some criticisms so i will start off with the positives. this idea is a good one mostly because things like recoil and sight picture arent easily available from the weapon stats or in game before buying i know i wouldnt have bought an m if i had known and i will never buy the m because i do know how bad its sight is. But unfortunately if your goal is short and concise weapon demos i think you may want a drastic change to the format.the goal of a short concise weapon demo should be showing the weapon firing its recoil and how controllable it is.  seconds of this  second video were superfluous and only there for artistic purposes from artsy camera angles to reloading reload time being a simple weapon stat like ammo count and damage can be viewed in plain text and doesnt really need a video to show the animation the complete opposite of short and concise. it also took  seconds before you even see the weapon fire thats  of the video. and  seconds before you even see the ironsights.the final part is the content this i have no real answer to but this clip shows someone attempting to get the most out of the gun at range so theres recoil compensation and short bursts. which means it doesnt show the raw recoil or cone of fire bloom that happens with full auto. now its good to show how the gun CAN be tamed but maybe only do that with half the magazine then let rip with the rest to show how wild it can be? but too much feature creep can extend the video length past the short concise levels for instance do you add hipfire? so now you get burst and full auto in both hip and ADS what about weapons with select fire etc etc suddenly too much information and the video is  minutes longall in all i like the idea and good luck with it even if you decide not to change things more information will always be better the suggestions are only there to further condense the information etc.,HeroesandGenerals,czmo50l,2,t5_2tnq5

Ive been in this situation before your approach looks very much like a person who has a destination in mind but they dont know how to get there. Its clear you dont like OHK because it hinders the way you like to play but you dont have the experience needed to actually make an informed and unbiased point.Thats fine though CQC players might not have the logical high ground on this issue but they have the raw numbers and thats all you need. Its a moot point. Heavyset sway long distance HK SAs long distance HK LMGs and infantry scopes arent going anywhere because the numbers demand it.But dont pretend like its somehow deserved. Youre only fooling yourself. When LMGs and SAs are outperforming BA rifles at range and with a lower time to kill theres something seriously wrong with balance.

7226081,0,t1_d1z0pzl,Binocs  rifle without scope is way cheaper than having a scope and possibly more effective since youd have an advantage over people with scopes in cqb. Just use the binocs to find people whip out your rifle look in that general area and you should be able to find your target again with with the rifle relatively quickly after which you can take the shot. More time consuming than using a scope but it also trains you to be better at spotting guys who are really far away even when youre using your iron sight since when look at them through the irons you will get an idea of what a person looks like at that range and will know to look for that figure next time. I actually learned this from ARMA but its the same concept in this game and youre engaging at a much closer distance in hampg than in Arma so it shouldnt be too difficult.

Just killing an enemy tank feels like Im actually putting a dent in the enemy war machine. I also started war at lvl . Id already spent  hours in the game grinding only skirmish maps I wasnt gonna wait another  hours to try war. My suggestion is if you want to continue playing staged do so but if youve been looking forward to playing war then go ahead and try it and see how you fare. If its too hard then practice a bit more in staged before you go again.

Or even better start killing tanks! Use the mines in the beginning or bazooka later then stickies or H.

7749552,0,t1_d3n06b7,I kinda get why they want this design it means you have to be using teamwork to get adaptability. Thats pretty reasonable and being able to make a  man squad that has all the things defeats the entire purpose of the system. My main issue is that the autogenerated squads cant be customized. So if Im lone wolfing it and it makes me squad leader and I start rolling with some randos...were all stuck with whatever class we started with. Unless I add them to my friends list and we reform the squad. But what if I dont want to pollute my friends list with every rando Ive ever squadded with?Something that could help is to have a squad matchmaker to use instead of having squads randomly created at the start of a battle. So if youre starting a squad you click a button to say that youre open to people joining. People who want to join a squad see your name the squad name  type and how many squad points you have available maybe?. Then you can actually team up with people without actually having to be friends with them first. Itd do a lot to improve the amount of teamwork going on I think.,HeroesandGenerals,d3n2ewn,1,t5_2tnq5
7758450,0,t3_4lkoe0,Not too many Recon use the SAs in their build but the GER one does have its advantage with a x scope.  I think personally that it is wasteful of the Recons better mods for the BA even if you do play aggressively.  The SMK hart with fine trigger on the Kk can accomplish the same outcome if you are using a sidearm in your loadout AND you have the chance of taking out the enemy in one shot if they arent wearing HS gold.  The G will always be  shot and sometimes  shot depending on HS gold distance to target and where your shots are landing.  If you are not using a pistol as a sidearm and the G is your only true weapon then it might be worth it.

A direct credit cost or something similar.However some people need to leave for legitimate reasons i.e. kid playing and his parents are ready to leave to take him to dinner so he has to log off. Therefore make it some sort of like a Pokemon Go soft ban you cant earn any credits or EXP for matches you join within a certain time limit of leaving a bad match say any match started within  minutes of leaving a match. That way if the kid leaves for a legitimate reason hed be able to keep earning cash after getting back from a hr dinner break.Or if you want to be a softie make it a creditEXP debuff that stacks for the consecutive number of games raged that clears at the end of the day You leave a match all other matches that day earn  less exp and credits. The second match you leave ups that to . That way you have a LITTLE leeway for what matches you really choose to bail from.,HeroesandGenerals,d74cn6o,1,t5_2tnq5

8839780,0,t3_517pkj,I remember when I felt like I was going to be gunned down the second I popped my head out of cover!You will get better eventually. Some more tips from meYou can still snipe long range without a scope. Spacebar zeros your sights.And dont forget nades. Nade spam a cap point then run in and take your pick of weapons.I see a lot of people seem overly focused on their weapon. While obviously some weapons are superior to others they are all killing machines. Play to their strengths.Only mod for distinct improvements rather than an expensive tiny increase. Avoid ammo mods unless they are really needed. Grinding on an unmodded weapon keeps your expenses negligible. Also if you see an unspotted tank make sure you spot it and keep it spotted. If he pops his head out kill him and take his tank.And a wrench can be a nice supplement to your xp and helps your tanker bros.Watch out for friendly APCs in good positions.

Sure this can be remedied by halftracks but the coordination required to pull that off would only happen in War and only sometimes too.I would like to see that sometime in the future soon Reto EXPANDS the town in the direction of A line. Make A line a point or even a point line and push the O and O points towards AA direction. I feel that this fixes the attackers dilemma to an extent since now DECB all have that beachhead spawn in town proper and the spawns dont cramp up the town which is happening currently.Edit what do you think uMaster ?,HeroesandGenerals,d9i7gha,2,t5_2tnq5

9968853,0,t1_db6t3p7,I agree  though I disagree with you on the speed I think they went a little too fast with the fighters. Slightly bit slower would make the world of difference. But in terms of the new raw and roll switch theres no fucking reason for changing it I preferred it the other way so why am I forced to relearn all over again  all they need to do is allow us to rebound the keys ourselves. Its not like its even hard work for them either since they just need to add an option and allow us to switch it!The speed thing is really irritating me and I agree with you when you say that you have to switch between modes in order to speed up or slow down. It used to be a set speed that we could manage ourselves with the W and S keys but now its just brake and automatically goes faster which is retarded.,HeroesandGenerals,db6yuwf,1,t5_2tnq5

10270202,0,t3_5n2daq,There are two different types of gameplay. The first is staged mode in which each class paratrooper infantry tanker recon and fighter pilots are randomly put together by a matchmaker. These are what you call ATAssault Teams put together by matchmaking. The other part of gameplay is War where on the rts map you directly control the AT. When you move your AT into a city occupied by the enemy you start a battle. The battle starts preparing which gives time to for your allies and enemies to send AT into the city. When the preparing stage is over the battle starts. This new match is avaliable to PEOPLE who can play War. They join the battle and use YOUR AT. There is no AI in the game every AT you use and put on the war map directly affects the game and players. Moving your tanker AT into a match where the enemy team has no tanks can be very helpful to the people playing in that match as well as sending in more infantry if they are low. Since in war the classes in each match are affected by who puts them into the battle war matches are usually always unbalanced. So just a recap REAL people use your AT and no AI are in the game. Your AT have a direct affect on the war. On the other side as well make sure when you are playing war games to not overuse resources as they are being used at the expense of the people who sent them there.,HeroesandGenerals,dc86mer,12,t5_2tnq5

10580726,0,t3_5rgrls,I think the Chaffee is the best light tank although not my personal preference simply because it can play as a tank destroyer when trying to punch above its weight.The Chaffee and the Luchs both counter eachother very well the Chaffee is more of a sniper and if he can keep the Luchs at a distance hes generally safe however the Luchs is a brawler and excels in close quarters and hitnrun tactics and can shred anything short of a T even from the front so long as you have apcr. The T doesnt get enough credit IMO as its shorter reload time allows you to put out almost as much damage as a Chaffee and your frontal armor allows you to almost completely negate both panzer s both C and L variants and potentially absorb shots from the Stuart and the t Ive even had  instance of bouncing a Chaffee round though it was just the . If you consider the t as being able to counter you the T can as it is effectively a better t.,HeroesandGenerals,dd7bj92,1,t5_2tnq5

I havent had played much since they changed the credit earning system. However its my understanding that they removed the reward for killing tanks and i dont think there ever was a reward for killing planes if there was it wasnt a very large amount and now your earnings are purely based off salary and xp earned.

And the limiting factor for fire rate with a semiauto gun at least for me is how fast you can click. I cant click fast enough while carefully aiming during a closerange firefight to take advantage of rpm.

10879164,0,t1_de22ubc,The st Special Service Force were light infantry special forces so while I think that they were trained for parachuting shenanigans and other whatnot they were mainly infantry. I dont know if they ever actually did a combat jump.The only dedicated paratroopers that used the Johnson LMG were the Paramarines who interestingly were disbanded over a year before the war ended and hoping that I correctly remember the Forgotten Weapons video about it they only got the guns when the Marine Corps sort of bought the surplus guns that the Dutch colonial forces had ordered but couldnt receive because the Japanese had invaded. Supposedly they then traded the guns to the st Special Service Force for explosives.Anyway its the st Special Service Force that was known for using the Johnson LMG and I suspect that they used it in combat more.While some of the things you say are true rarity doesnt matter. The FG  is limited to German paratroopers because they were the only ones that used them but the M carbine while I agree it shouldnt have a scope as it cant even be used at long range Chaffee and AVS which I think was used against the Japanese and the Finnish simply were used historically and therefore can be used ingame.I agree with you about the M not because it didnt have a stock until the A variant which was all metal and made it even heavier but because it was gt lbs and like you said it didnt have anywhere for the user to hold it so hipfiring with a glove or some kind of carrying handle would have been the only options but Ive been hoping that the  lb MGs will handle like the MG  does now when they add bipods. All of those MGs should be forced into their own specific role as supportive LMGs but still with a limited ability to fire offhand such as the MG  does now preferably worse than that really.,HeroesandGenerals,de23wtd,3,t5_2tnq5
