There is pushing where the crowd surges back and forth.  Thats just what happens.I dont really know what you expected.  My experience up close to No Doubt was  exactly what I expected it to be like at the front of that show.  The only exceptions were the audience members at the front who didnt get it.  Saw two fights almost break out after someone mistakenly assumed that you get something like personal space at the front of a concert.  And of course there is always the crowd of concert newbies who have to flee the front in the first couple songs after they realize what they have gotten themselves into.Stage design wasnt perfectif you are going to do a divider it should be a middle dividerbut if you think no doubts crowd was really bad...I dont think I would want to see them with what you think is good.,RiotFest,cv1b6gl,7,t5_2wqhk
