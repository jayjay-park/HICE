5017076,0,t3_3jbkbq,Question if the guild battle has been won does damaging the enemy more give the guild more GP for victory? I have assumed it doesnt so if I still had swords after we had won I would go for the destroyed  freebies if there are any. Not that I am waiting for this to not contribute to the win its more timing issue and I see we have already won when I look.I definitely think that if we are against a difficult guild it is important to spread out attacks because we get more stones for winning vs being selfish. But it seems like most times we do get a victory. Maybe Im just unaware of how other people spend their swords and some people are sacrificing a lot of their swords to lower people? Maybe we can advice people if they feel they are low on GP to save the last sword until after we have victory and take the freebies? But I dont want that to compromise us winning so Im not sure...Anyway I will keep this post in mind for future battles.Nosilla,swsapphire,cuqqxxi,1,t5_37by9
