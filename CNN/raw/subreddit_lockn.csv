See my comment on the main post.But yea dont be dick as always. To be honest Ive been in tent only camping the last three years with endless room and suggest it to anyone reading this thread.  More room closer to the music and cheaper. Sure you gotta haul your gear  to  yards but you know welcome to festival camping.,lockn,d06qeqb,2,t5_30i8f

7661975,0,t3_4k2vfi,My buddy who has done the official poster in years past says that they are first come first serve and are available when the gates open. They tend to go fast. Also the folks walking around selling shirts are bootleggers and are taking money away from the people who worked hard to design and distribute the official merchandise. ,lockn,d3d4fsl,1,t5_30i8f
