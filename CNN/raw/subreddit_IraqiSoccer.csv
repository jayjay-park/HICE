6406297,0,t1_czhth2y,Honestly...I rarely see Nadhim produce anything. Only reason I put him there was because hes always the captain and surely Abdulgheni knows something I dont lol.Ibrahim would be an interesting addition but would mean we need to take out one of the other . Perhaps Younis we will need to learn to play without him eventually,IraqiSoccer,czhtxd8,1,t5_32zmu
