9095627,0,t3_54ufw1,First off best advice is never attempt to time the market.Now with that disclaimer out of the way I need to say that Ive always been extremely skeptical of the fundamentals behind this meme. I feel like its base of investors really expanded quickly through a lot of mainstream sources which leads to a MemeMcMansion built on a tool sheds foundation. As a Quantitative minded memebroker I like to find memes that prove that they can grow organically without much mainstream support so that when the next crash hits they have the organizational support to pull through. When a fresh meme is touted so quickly by athletes and news outlets I honestly question its lasting power. I could very well be wrong though and it definitely could use more analysis just my two cents.,MemeEconomy,d855cru,7,t5_3gl3k

Youre nothing more than a reaction to the oversensitive radical left confined to a narrative that relies on painting all people that dont align with you to the polar opposition. That much is obvious by how you are unable to understand with someone who disagrees with you and yet isnt an offended crusader. Its sad actually because the people you malign control your every action albeit in a removed and reflexive way. Those of us who live in the real world see both of you as different sides to the same coin. We think youre all batshit and much more alike than youd care to admit. Laugh all you want just dont be surprised when the majority of the people outside the bubble youve created think youre a disgusting person. Enjoy the isolation.

Example Only someone who had seen the show and new the theme song would understand this meme. However a SPongeBob meme does not require knowledge of the show and if it does SpongeBob is enough of a pop culture figure to understand the reference.

Where the hell do you get the idea that the electoral college was there to prevent the overturn of slavery? Its there to insure the everyone has a say in elections. Without it the US is basically the United States of California.And yeah it is representative. You elect your state legislators right? And they appoint your states electors. You are albeit indirectly choosing the electors. And in almost all cases it is rather rare that this doesnt happen if a candidate gets the majority among the people in a state it gets all of that states electoral votes. In some cases an elector can change hisher vote but many if not most states outlaw it and require the elector to vote for the majority in the state. Larger states still have an edge in that they have more electoral votes Texas for example has  and California has . Stop complaining about it not being representative when it is. I get the feeling that people who complain about the electoral college and make up bullshit reasons for the framers having it are just butt hurt because their guygal I hesitate to call Hillary a gal more like a side of beef didnt get in...gtwrath of a white manNot one white man two votesHoly shit and Trump supporters are the racist ones? Say hello to rTD. What the hell does being white have to do with the validity of my argument anyway?The electoral college gives nobody superior power over another in elections.

In a videotape recorded before the massacre Harris expressed enthusiasm for the planned shooting saying it would be like fucking Doom.

11679219,0,t1_dgjufjf,This seems to be something people often forget. In the real stock exchange things are considered worth more when more people want them. You know supply and demand. People here seem to think that once something becomes popular it loses value and thats a bit ridiculous. Sure the quality of the memes will suffer and once a meme reaches the normies it wont be something that you can actually enjoy anymore but if you invested early youll be raking in the GBPs. Being a meme trader isnt about sentimental attachment to memes its about GBPs plain and simple.,MemeEconomy,dgjutwb,10,t5_3gl3k

11771555,1,t1_dgu9kiu,I guess my best counter without doing an actual search is a question. Why do you assume that gender comes from biological sex? Is there really any reason to assume that  of the time this is true?Now whether or not one see this as a mental disorder is probably based on ones personal opinion on the topic. I cant imagine that one can purely objectively determine whether or not this is a disorder.TLDR why should gender be determined by sex?,MemeEconomy,dguc5lu,1,t5_3gl3k

Pyschology is a social science and so psychological beliefs are often constructed from our understanding of society and culture.Are often constructed is not always and i think you know it.You are purposely letting your bias interfere with the reality.The point of the article is to show there is a brain basis for this.gtYou may notice the emphasis on the word feeling i.e. not biologyFeeling based on neuroanatomy.Or are you telling me that you can convert and deconvert transgender people with therapies?gtThese articles aim to study whether or not those feelings are influenced by our underlying biology but gender and its related terminology are and always have been defined by our culture and society.How did you even connected these  sentences?These studies aim to show us if our biology defines our gender identity but i know its decided by culture and society.You literally went and discarded science in favor of mercurial sociology.,MemeEconomy,dgurxry,1,t5_3gl3k
