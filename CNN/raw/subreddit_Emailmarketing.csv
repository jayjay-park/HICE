2726075,0,t1_cncsc39,Hi SuccessNoStressSplit test is all about how many of our customers are willing to open our emails. It depends on how strongly we have built relationship with them so far. It also depends on how much interesting your email subject is to them. These two facts are the only reasons that will take our subscribers to the next level so that they open the email for more info.For segmentation purposes there are three types of subscribers in our list in terms of behavior. Active users leaders these users mostly open the the emails and take action. . Passive users followers are those who open emails but they dont  take action or the dont want to be the first to explore new things they mostly move with the flow and wait for a proven result or they need some encouragement from active subscribers.. Idle subscribers they neither open emails nor they take any action.All the three types have their own characteristics to consider. For instance when emailing to the passive group usually lengthy content is not encouraging and counteractive.After all if the emails offer purchases there must be a good analysis of the customers buying behavior such as price sensitivity credit card safety concerns and such. The information can be collected through email surveys. Then we separate them into different groups and take action accordingly.  ,Emailmarketing,cndxyys,1,t5_2r1yx

8371944,0,t3_4u73by,Mailchimp is a good place to move the list. If youre technical you can also look into Mailgun which is pretty good.In terms of reactivating dont waste an email. In your first email to the group just make a joke about what a long time it has been and get on with the message you want to convey.,Emailmarketing,d5o1k66,2,t5_2r1yx
8470021,0,t3_4v0x2n,To answer your second question yes theres a way to automate that kind of dynamic data. Ideally as a field of data in your subscriber records or as a mailchimps group membership displaying that info is to pull in dynamic values. Youve probably seen inin MC for a first name using dynamic value |FNAME|   hard to give specific advise without knowing your templates and change needs though,Emailmarketing,d60ajar,0,t5_2r1yx
