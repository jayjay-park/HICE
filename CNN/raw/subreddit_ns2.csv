42939,0,t3_1uf7vm,A lot of these suggestions are horrible. Lets go with the first oneAs is map control is already extremely important. Empty rooms are important for flanking positions and obviously rooms with nodes are important because every. fucking. res node. counts.Number ? Commander already is an interactive role. Im an alien comm so I cant talk much for Rines but with Cat packs Med packs and ammo I assume thats a full time job. As an alien comm. We have drifters you control them they heal they buff units and they create controllable phantoms which are always fun.? infestation can be used to attack structures slowly which is helpful to cause a distraction. Also cysts can be popped for some sort of attack Ive never actually seen used.... Things are already balanced pretty decently as is. A melee weapon sort of defeats the purpose of a marine considering their goal is to be at range. Not to mention ammo consumption is thus ignored. A pistol upgrade would mean a player could theoretically have a  shot kill with a shotgun as well as a powerful ranged attack... THAT SEEMS BALANCED RIGHT? A rifle upgrade? Yeah thatd be weapons upgrade which makes the rifle more powerful we already have that. A bomb? Arcs. They shoot through walls you can defend them with more than a pistol.So yeah those are all pretty game breakingeyredundant suggestions.Welcome to the community though.,ns2,cejbiv0,1,t5_2rfpj

246950,0,t1_cf64lr6,Frankly I think youve become one of the best NS casters along with Blind.  Not to slam RedDog but he basically screams a lot of OMG A SKULK JUST DIED !!! and yelling out the names of players instead of actually giving thoughtful commentary or pointing out strategies or potential good  bad moves made by either team.  I think Kaneh has a ton of potential as well as he gives really great insight on strategies and I like his more laid back approach as it doesnt give me a headache after ten minutes of listening.  You and Blind might need to tone down RedDog during the NSWC finals as he tends to try to hog mic time yelling out the kill feed. I truly dont mean any disrespect to RedDog and I appreciate the time that he puts into casting the games but I find the constant yelling of the kill feed and his general overexcitement at small engagements pretty exhausting.  I also prefer yours Wasabi and Blinds camera work over pretty much anyone else who casts  I think you guys have really nailed down where to be and when is a good time to go first person to keep the viewers engaged.,ns2,cf6cl8s,-11,t5_2rfpj
253390,0,t1_cf4qojj,You will always see a delayed version of what the situation due to lag effects. Network is just one part. Your brain is another. Screen mouse keyboard etc.It all adds delays. Getting the jump on someone will give you an advantage much more than ping and reaction speed. If you are reacting to other players you are already too late in most situations.Predicting your opponents actions will close this gap and put you ahead.Strategy games use a different model all together usually turn based with moves submitted well ahead of time.fractions of a second still Also animations are used to hide the lag from the players. This is why you dont notice the lag in dota. Here there are no animations to cover up and your moves are completed as they reach the server more or less.,ns2,cf70o2l,2,t5_2rfpj

429787,0,t1_cfo68lx,Yeah I can understand the skill gap between players in the same server but this could be easily fixed if the game had more popularity to support leagues of some sort or a way to measure skill . This could be implemented into a proper matchmaking system in which only people in the same skillleague set as you could play on that server. Something like bronzesilvergold and masters could really fix your problem. However the game simply doesnt have enough popularity to support this system as there is only a few full servers at one time. ,ns2,cfpb9ds,1,t5_2rfpj

1252790,0,t3_28fxi3,I watched your video about halfway through before getting bored. The main problem there is youre fighting advanced lifeforms lurks fades all by yourself with the standard LMG. Youre going to have a bad time if you do that. Its night impossible to take down a fade solo with a LMG even for good marine players. Taking on a lurk is doable with good aim but is generally only possible from longer range i.e. a lurk charging at you through a long straight corridor.Some more specific tips  Death  charging alone into enemy territory when you know theres a lurk isnt a good idea... Death  when constructing the power always look around and be aware of your surroundings. Also never finish the power node unless something else has been constructed. Have a look at your partner marine nobody is looking backwards which is usually bad especially in that area where its very easy to be flanked. Death  Being flanked by a fade will kill you. Your reaction to it was a bit slow though... Also note that the fade could be seen on the minimap before it hit you... Death  Close range vs skulk is always a toss up Death  Too much reloading. Also no reaction as youre being bitten by that skulk. Try jumping around when youre being attacked. Death  This is basically an alien ambush where the aliens outnumber you and in an area thats beneficial to them i.e. corners. You take down one fade here and  marines die. This is a net win for the marines as I believe none of them had any heavy weapons with them.  Death  You were in an advantageous position aliens had to come at you through a long corridor constructing a sentry and then you charged forwards right into  aliens of which one a fade...  Death   LMG marines vs  fades and a skulk... Yeah not going to happen.Got bored after that. Hope it gives you some insight.,ns2,ciajyl2,12,t5_2rfpj

2813227,0,t3_2s3oxc,There is definitely a steep learning curve with the game.  As someone who played the original Natural Selection and who played NS competitively for a while I have to say that I preferred the original to the sequel as well.  That has very little to do with design features and more to do with hit registry since Ive noticed some huge inconsistencies with hit registry when playing against players with high pingseven more noticeable than in other FPS games.  Its not as big of a deal when youre playing on Marines but on Aliens its a HUGE deal because its hard to estimate where the player might actually be when youre dealing with melee attacks.Then there is the matter of trolls and pub stompers.  Since this is a niche genre those types of players have more of an effect on the community than say Counter Strike or Battlefield.  If Im outplaying those around me by a significant margin than I will go Gorge or focus on welding things up so that Im not ruining the game for others but thats not a mindset that everyone shares unfortunately.I do have to give props to Unknown Worlds for the huge performance improvements theyve made since launch though.  To be honest I dont think the game was ready when they launched it but theyve done a pretty good job of fixing it and now its time to focus more on the marketing and word of mouth side of things.  Maybe some more free weekends or something to show people that the game has vastly improved from the one they played a year ago.,ns2,cnnutws,2,t5_2rfpj

If you cant afford the  bucks it costs on average considering how often it goes on sale you should just look for a different game.NS Doesnt offer anything that could be monetized which means they would have to create content for said change. Granted as a long time player new content would be GREAT! but typically with FP models its always pointless cosmetic shit that saturates the market.

My guess is that because there were changes to hit detection AND network latency they got something screwed up and when testing hit detection they did it with stationary targets how else will you know  if the new hit detection worked? and didnt test hit detection as things jumped around and actively evaded their attacker.My guess is we have much improved hit detection... on where the enemy was a splitsecond ago.
