7532930,0,t3_4ifmka,Starting to think Oscar Mikes ultimate is a bit crap. Sos Phoebes. I think I might replace Oscar Mike with Mellka since Mellka does more damage in three hits than Oscar Mike in eight hits. Much more useful.,BattleBornTap,d2yggoi,1,t5_3egi8

7899868,0,t1_d43vgp1,Very well analyzed.  I really do think youre right.  Thanks for the writeup!,BattleBornTap,d440p9s,2,t5_3egi8
7910872,0,t3_4nm823,yes it does. so you should not only focus on getting the best gear for your setup but for all battleborn as the global damage works even when they are not on your actual team. I have spend some prestiges alone only to upgrade gear for chars i dont use just to be able to invest scrap into maxing out their equipment.,BattleBornTap,d459948,1,t5_3egi8
7921730,0,t1_d4631a9,not that i know of. you will end up having to used them in a fast prestige run to . but if you go full aoe  the one you want to upgrade gear one this should only take a few minutes.,BattleBornTap,d46h71k,2,t5_3egi8
8601758,0,t1_d6goso9,yea i saw that but increasing my battleborns dps seems better than my tap dps.for example level  battleborn vs level  tap damage and level  battleborn has more dps than my tap dps.sorry for not including this detail.Adding it to the post now!,BattleBornTap,d6gtau9,2,t5_3egi8
