6113507,0,t1_cykij8j,The only problems you cited were overbooked and hard to schedule appointments. The only larger problem youve indicated is that HSU is so good at what they do that they need additional staff. The other redditors thirdhand complaint in this thread was devoid of specifics which in my book makes it worthless. Hell it being thirdhand disqualifies it alone. There is nothing to evaluate no context to the complaint.There will always be disgruntled patientspatronscustomers. How many super amazing trusted products on Amazon dont have star reviews? On top of this were talking about customers who go in for help at HSU already in an unhappy state of mind. Not every person suffering depression or whatever ailment will get better not every person is in the state of mind to do so. We all have very different baggage we carry some people carrying it since birth.The unhappy people are the most vocal. The maxim in retail is that if youre lucky a satisfied customer will tell  other person but an unhappy customer will tell .If you submitted this question with your mind made up then delete it and submit a selfpost where you ask opinions about services that are only offcampus. Because what youre complaining about doesnt make sense to me. Its not a reason to avoid the oncampus help unless the delay in getting an appointment is like a month or something.Whats the cost? When I was a student center services were free unless medication is required Im talking about nonmental health medicine I dont know if they prescribe medicine for mental health issues. Why wouldnt you try them out? In a worst case scenario youve lost  minutes or an hour of your time and then are equipped with certain knowledge that you should try offcampus. And if not then hey success. Dont be afraid of success.,humboldtstate,cykjjui,0,t5_2s5om
