10521325,0,t1_dd0ouhr,Thanks for the feedback. Do you know why the mag spacer is there in the first place? I seek to understand this as I dont want to damage the gun. Id rather dispose of  worth of budget ammo than damage something trying to get it to work.I bought the stuff on chance anyway. I knew the odds were against it because if it were any good the dedicated Seecamp community wouldve let it be known. However I have used PPU ammo quite successfully in . where its also said to be hit or miss Ive had  success so I took the chance.I just hate to see it go to waste.,seecamp,dd0pf5i,2,t5_3a9y8
