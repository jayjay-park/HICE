4948876,0,t3_3ioqip,Yo ubananapieAppreciate your contribution here. This is indeed a pretty sweet amalgam of two shows from west coast leg of the Macs  tour. Even though this constitutes a discrepancy within the context of our  Rule You must provide a link for the entirety of the show this seems to be as close to as full a document of the show as is readily available.However we cannot allow for simply copypasting from the document to serve as the submission title. In this instance Something to the effect of Fleetwood Mac live at the L.A. Forum Los Angeles CA  Oct  amp  rock video stream would be acceptable.

6944171,0,t1_d13dg46,gt Point  makes it seem like the band was trying to take advantage of him by forcing shared credit just because they were more experienced.I suggest you listen to Mike Doughty  Circles and tell me that the band didnt add some creativity to the songs. The Circles album is his reimagination of Soul Coughing songs as a solo project but it ends up sounding like amateur coversremixes.,listentoconcerts,d13g9ua,4,t5_2wv0p
