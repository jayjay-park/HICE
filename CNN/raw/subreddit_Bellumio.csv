9380371,0,t1_d9509fr,uh if you think I dont know how to play your wrong also teaming  getting kicked? if that was true every server would be void of people Palso did you know killing and removing people  gains the most points so when ever you get the chance bully the weakRIP weaker people they all cry as strong people bully them. Also did you know you start with  bases not  its just that the second one that is placed randomly doesnt matter. Also you should add that clicking  and the button basically lets you earn x faster. Thank you anyways for your uh concern? ,Bellumio,d9511pd,1,t5_3gwv8
