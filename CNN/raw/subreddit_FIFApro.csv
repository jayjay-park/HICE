2893096,0,t1_cnwxuc0,For pro clubs Ive found that it helps A LOT if you have someone playing a devoted defensive midfield position. If you dont have someone like that  works pretty well when youre on defensive.But pro clubs is just a bit broken so if you dont have human defenders youre gonna get screwed frequently. Its just going to happen when you have  CAMs running at your  rated RB  times a game.,FIFApro,cnwy67o,2,t5_35jzx
2893671,0,t1_cnx02k0,This is my favorite team at the moment. Dzyuba is just so damn good. Someone here recommended him to me a while back and I havent looked back. I mean hes  with  strength  finishing  pace  heading and  WF. He actually has more goals than Doumbia for me.This is my Dempsey team This is the only squad that has an issue with the CMs pushing up too far but its because Jones and Bradley both have HH workrates. Still a great team and yeah the player instructions help a lot in keeping them back.And this is my third one I sold Neymar and Silva a while ago but Ill probably sell another team and buy them back soon.,FIFApro,cnx0iw6,3,t5_35jzx
2894987,0,t1_cnx5otd,Yep I still accidentally let the shot rip sometimes too but its definitely a trick worth mastering and one I imagine EA nerfing in future FIFAs because its animation happens far quicker than it should just like how tricks used to happen way too quick to react to.But enjoy it while you can.,FIFApro,cnx5woa,2,t5_35jzx
2906901,0,t1_cnyi01t,Heres my first good attempt Normally Id take the shot with the first player but I aimed my cross poorly so he had to step back and take a difficult touch. But still it leaves both guys on the edge of the box open and you can see how close it was!,FIFApro,cnyis90,1,t5_35jzx
2907134,0,t1_cny9ycs,what cutscene? ,FIFApro,cnyjqnm,2,t5_35jzx
2915025,0,t1_cnzfxx1,Yeah it seems to work with any player really. But the more curve the better. I tried Pirlo but his shot power is so low that I wouldnt recommend him. Id say just look for someone with  curve  shot power and decent accuracy.,FIFApro,cnzg2d6,2,t5_35jzx
2926554,0,t1_co0q8o7,Yeah I ended up looking through the FIFA  ones the first time through by accident and then found the  ones for the rest.,FIFApro,co0rbtx,1,t5_35jzx
2935056,0,t1_co0hvhd,Same. It seems like too much of a gamble to me. Id much rather work the ball into the box.,FIFApro,co1q877,2,t5_35jzx
2936684,0,t3_2ts50o,I havent spent any money on FUT and I managed to make it to division . In fact most people with really good squads before div  are often not vey good anyways. And its always super satisfying beating teams with Ronaldo or Messi with your k bpl team. If you spend your coins wisely by div  you should have made at least k and you buy a decent team. Thats what I like about FUT you can be competitive without having an expensive team and beating those who have really expensive squads is quite rewarding. ,FIFApro,co1wwdu,3,t5_35jzx

2997865,0,t3_2uha2k,Lot of people seem to think a couple points dont matter.  I wouldnt worry about it.  Whats your team look like?,FIFApro,co8q5xs,3,t5_35jzx
3015364,0,t1_coajax4,I think people put too much emphasis on chem. Just think about this A player on  chem will received  of his attributes and no penalty.Once you have played a player on  chem you can see that chem cards dont have much effect on their play style or performance. I wouldnt pay much for any chem card but I always try to buy players with Hunter or Shadow since they are the easiest to resell.,FIFApro,coajhbl,2,t5_35jzx

3589655,0,t1_cq067so,In addition to the guy who mentioned pulling defenders and trying to cut across defenders I think you can boil it down to bad decision making. A lot of your passing moves are constant  balls which is fine but you play a lot  risky passes and dribbles that just dont come off. Also I would say you need to be more clinical in front of goal there were a few times where you had a easy chance and bottled it. ,FIFApro,cq1g5f7,1,t5_35jzx
