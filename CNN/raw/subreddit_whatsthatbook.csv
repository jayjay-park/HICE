Im afraid I dont recognize the story youre describing but I wanted to suggest that you repost your query in a slightly different format in order to get more views and increase your odds of getting a solution Use a title that describes the book more specifically if you can. Maybe something like YA book with class stranded on island murdered one by one? Those types of posts seem to have better luck here.
