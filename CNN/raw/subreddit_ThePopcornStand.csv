Shadowbans are symbolic more than anything practical.Im not sure what else they can do. They could ban the sub I suppose but it will be back under a different name pretty quickly if they did so. Its not that effective.Reddit isnt a law enforcement agency and I dont think they want to be one. All they can do after this is to make their records and logs available to any law enforcement agencies who require them.

Are you really denying these obviously true facts?Im not denying those claims Im pointing out that describing it as matriarchy makes no sense. Or are you redefining the formal definition of matriarchy to literally mean just that?You can do that if you like but Im not sure what utility that is or what it adds to our understanding of the world.gtReally can you provide some examples of such studies? Because most of the studies of rape on campus Ive seen systematically ignore male victims.Sure off the top of my head is this one The Campus Sexual Assault SurveyThe reason why assault on women is more commonly studied is because they are the vast bulk of reported victims the vast bulk of those that talk about it outside of legal cases and the entirety of research has consistently suggested that women are the vast bulk of those affected.

4975109,0,t1_culnbcs,I phrased it wrong I guess. I just dont like the image mens rights gives itself. Creating a victim complex and having to war with feminism. Its completely rational to be a feminist and a supporter of a mans right to see his children and so on. Though I do admit SRS does nothing to garner support for the cause. I have seen them act like the issues men call out are non issues when they should be part of a larger feminist platform. Its reactionary though. Im rambling. I like you too pal. ,ThePopcornStand,culnegy,2,t5_2ufmh
5020449,0,t3_3jlz84,gtYou are insane if you think MRA groups would purposefully fill up all the spots at an event for women to keep women oppressed or whatever you think is going on in the world. This way of thinking is sick and insane the world is not like this there is no conspiracy out there of men trying to keep women down. Women in the western world are the most privileged class of people in all of history and men are not out there trying to oppress them and keep them down.Insane? Or just projecting?EditgtRava refused to speak to me on the phone because he said he was concerned Yahoo News would misquote him. He also later emailed me to say I hope you print all sides to your story because I am sure you would not want someone to publish a story about you on the Internet labeling you a predator a gigantic bitch an elitist a soulless harpie a narcissist and a dumb woman without that story presenting facts or opinions to the contrary.Yes I  believe that a practicing lawyer who had already decided not to speak to you on the phone for fear of being misquoted would turn around and email you all that.,ThePopcornStand,cur5m16,16,t5_2ufmh

6207585,0,t1_cyv4yhq,Jewdank was a mod in rdrama for about a month. She made a project syncing up subtitles to South Park gifs assigning characters to sub regulars and made a small story out of them. The guy in the thread worked on it with her video editing adding text etc.  When she posted it a few weeks ago just before Christmas as a gift to everyone most folks shit on it pretty hard. It got IMO a very disproportionate amount of hate but I think she was naive to the nature of a drama sub to not expect heavy ridicule. Still it seemed extra cruel and savage especially since it had been a lot of work. I might be biased though as I became fond of her while palling around with her in rTheFemPill modmail. In the linked drama the guy says someone said to her to kill herself and it was not taken down. This is true but everybody else got extremely pissed at him for that and directed all guns on him for a bit. She demodded herself after fighting and talking smack in there and in an SRD cross post and has been staying away since then.Not sure about the doxing details except that it was apparently a YouTube video with a drama regular that got removed.,ThePopcornStand,cyv8hvb,7,t5_2ufmh
