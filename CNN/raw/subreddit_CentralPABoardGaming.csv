4923757,0,t1_cuf5tis,Oh yeah Im considering buying Spike still need to play some others.My only problem with many economic train games and this is true of many other games as well is that I really dislike games that lack a luck element. I like games that have a mechanism that evens out winpoint chances for experienced and less experienced players.I know Ive heard about a few econ train games where if you dont do x y and z in the beginning you can be boned for the entire game... thats not fun for someone newer to the game.But yeah still into economic train games as a whole.,CentralPABoardGaming,cuf6fba,1,t5_34o4n
