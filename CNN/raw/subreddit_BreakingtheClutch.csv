11454857,0,t3_63gxvo,I say give it a try and see how everyone reacts to it. If you were going to start off with Halo  maybe not have the first video be simply Slayer w BtC fans me personally I never watch those videos because I dont get that much entertainment from it. Its like a regular match unless its MLG of course. Do something like Warzone w BtC fans but melee only! Just for example. Or maybe Halo  LASO oh the horror... But if anyone skipped this whole thing my answer is yes. ,BreakingtheClutch,dfueeeo,3,t5_3jubi
