There was too high of a risk that you would betray us again. Even though you apologized I do not believe there was any true remorse behind your words and if you must wonder why I feel so then you need only look at your actions toward Jack. You threatened the wellbeing of him and his wife on numerous occasions for no good reason. Im the one who brought up keeping you under house arrest because I felt that you were too dangerous to be around other campers and that letting you run around might give you time to plot something else with your mother. After everything that has happened...all I feel for you now is pity and disappointment. Ive lost all respect for you and any hopes I had that we could somehow still be friends is gone.

4553206,0,t3_3ddqr2,I wasnt really sure what to expect when the God of Madness stood before me knocking me out with a wave of his hand but I guess I could say I was ready for anything.When I awoke or at least thought I did thanks vision inducement I found myself in the middle isle of an abandoned looking supermarket. Every shelf was pristine and perfectly packed with canned goods and other assorted foods bright florescent light shining down on my face. I rose a hand to block out the light as I raised myself off luckily finding myself in my clothes my sword in my pocket Ill explain that bit a bit later. I hastily looked around the supermarket finally finding the source of my teleportation purpose standing over a helpless little kid clutching on to a pikachu doll.It was emmense to put it bluntly  oh and also absolutely horrifying but you know  snarling at the child who whimpered in fear as it backed up to the corner of the L shaped isle of medicine and icecream odd combination. It was huge with the body of a built goat the head of a menacing lion and a tail that split into the heads of two serpents both heads dripping corrosive poison on the white speckled tile of the supermarket. The chimera roared once again stalking its way towards the boy who looked at me for help and I lost all recognition of the Olympics.I took a deep breath reaching in to my pocket and pulling out the golden and bronze mechanical pen. Clicking the top of it it unfolded rather quickly transforming into the sword that Dean had crafted for me Eagles Voyage. Its cross guard was actually rather menacing  an eagle glaring down in mid flight with its wings spread  but I didnt pay attention to the detail. Instead I picked up a tub of icecream and lobbed it at the chimeras face. Direct hit luckily for the boy and a little less so for me as it turned its attention to me and breathed a mouthful of fire. My reflexes that I had been honing helped out there moving myself almost involuntarily behind the shelf Id found my ammunition on. It must have caught a glimpse of my sword and within its distraction the child ran behind a stack of shipped in medicines. The chimera gnarled its fangs at me and upon seeing the bronze of the blade and the gold of the handle it charged.I didnt really have to much of an option for space so I vaulted over a counter trying to lead the monster away from the kid. I was lucky I had managed to catch the pounce because the chimeras hooves managed to smash the tile on its way down from the air. I could only imagine what that would have done to my face. I backed up against the wall the chimera pouncing on to the counter. I took a swing good and hard managing to scare it off of the counter. It might have been humurous the way it slipped off but I couldnt exactly find the time to laugh. Slowly I made my way out and around the counter the monsters snake tail taking jabs at me. I managed to deflect their poisonous teeth with the metal of my blade that horrible sound echoing through the isle like a nail on chalkboard every time they collided. I chopped off one of the heads and while the other hissed in despair I chopped it off to silence it as well managing to roll around the chimera to face its back.The chimera started up its fire breath and all I could do was run. I sprinted as fast as I could down the linear isle throwing anything behind me to stop the flames. Fire collided against the items singing the back of my shirt and definitely leaving some burns and of course the chimera followed through with a pounce through the smoke. If I wasnt a demigod no way in hell would I have been able to notice the jump and in turn pierce its heart. Thunder struck on the collision from outside the supermarket as the beast fell its body crumbling to sand and moving through the cracks of the broken and soot covered tiles.I managed to find the kid looking more horrified than ever and tried to ease him by kneeling beside him. I held my hands up offering him the blade and smiling as he couldnt hold up the weight. He marveled at it noticing the lightning bolt engraved near the rain guard of the sword and smiled ecstatically. Pikachu! Pikachu! He almost did a dance as he showed me his doll. I nodded laughing a little as I took the doll in hand nodding at the nostalgia of my childhood and checking the boy over to make sure he didnt have any cuts. Yeah Pikachu I repeated a smile on my face.ooc Apologies for any spelling mistakes! Senpai mods notice me ,CampHalfBloodRP,ct4jxk6,1,t5_34k5q

With no hesitation he gave the dead fish on his back a few pats on the cheek like... a dead fish.Mordecai had actually been awake for already ten minutes from Marcus constant heaving and grumbling. Unfortunately he didnt crave for any sort of interaction at the moment specially with the discomfort he is currently experience. With the helpful duct tape and bandage wrapped around his side that made it hard for him to move around. If he was any conscious before hed went under a total blackout he would have jumped off the big guy and end up walking unassisted and less of an inconvenience to the other two. The Herculesspawn stretched for a good ten seconds after Mordecai had eventually asked to be let down. And that like every other idea hed had to take care of himself so far on their trip to Camp HalfBlood was a bad idea. But the certainly peculiar son of Melinoe knew better than showing pain and complaining about a sprained ankle! No big deal.

8343364,0,t3_4tucb5,Mia has neglected to claim a table for herself instead cordoning off a large area of ground for herself and her creations with a custom display case on the side for smaller projects.Her pride and joy is the centerpiece of the show a black motorbike with bronze gear accents and an Eta to match her arm that remains suspended wirelessly in the air above a circular metal platform. Nigh perfect this is the result of months of work for the mechanic with nearly every part either restored or custom made in order to fit the bike perfectly. Occasionally the wheels can flip sideways in order to float rather than drive and a ridiculous array of tricks are stored under its seamless exterior.In addition to her magnum opus there are three other bikes thrown together with a rugged aesthetic  though of course they run perfectly well. There are helmets off to the side for a future lesson and plans for dirtbikes for public perusal on one of her holotablets.Inside the cabinet are some trinkets and weapons  boxes like the one she keeps under the Hephaestus table in the pavilion to keep food in pristine condition and drinks nice and cold collapsing storage systems and a handheld blast chillersnow generator among other neat mechanical gadgets.Along with the more mundane objects in the cabin are also some convertible weapon prototypes Following the same ideology that led to the creation of her crossbowhammersword and her massive longbowballistaswordstaffx sword combo shes been experimenting with multi function more.And of course Ajax is there though now of all things he seems to be... wearing a cheeseburger costume.

I left a couple days ago just to go speak with my Dad in Central Park. He told me that he knows about Alistair Howland because Alistair is my grandfather and his father. He also mentioned that before my Dad was able to meet me as a baby Alistair stole me with the intention of raising me as his own and well... making me a murderer. He said he saw great potential for evil in me. Before my Dad saved from him however my grandfather branded me with a tattoo on my left wrist that I hadnt seen before because of the mist.Anyways at the end of our intense conversation my Dad said that Alistair has found another target now besides Liam and the others. He said that my grandfather is after me. And it turns out that he was right. A day later or so Alistair possessed me and killed half of me. Thats why my left eye turned red.I basically turned into a monster and several times I was very close to killing someone. He made me crazy by... speaking to me through my head and telling me to do horrible things. Thankfully Neil White and Gage Collins came to my rescue and well... they basically got him out of me. I was dying by then of course. Alistair was only seconds away from killing me before Neil finally managed to send him to the underworld. Hes a son of Hades.Now Im here.
