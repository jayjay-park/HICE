Basically he is saying that those possible downgrades down arrows  red triangles can actually be hidden upgrades up arrows green triangles because legendary set bonuses and elemental damage are not calculated into the formula.

5586106,0,t3_3rmzri,Hmmm thats weird.  All I can add since Im not real techsavvy is to make sure youre all trying to join the same TYPE of game.  Like if one person is in Adventure Mode and made the game but the others havent completed the story mode yet you wont be able to join.  All  would have to beat story mode first for you all to join the same Adventure mode game.  It should work in reverse though...the players that HAVE beaten story mode should be able to join a game created by those who havent.  Hope that makes sense.  Also amke sure whoever created the game has the setting set to Friends Only or Open.  If its a closed or private game nobody can join. This probably all seems like commonsense stuff but thought Id throw in what little I do know! lol good luck!  ,D3PS4,cwpibgv,1,t5_333c3

At Paragon level xx theres no chance of me gaining another level for a very long time on my own in the difficulty Im able to play with the items I have available and this will be the case now unless I reset my account.Sure I can keep running rifts hoping for the better items... but theres no more sense of achievement there working for my own character and account growth.

Just turn the difficulty to something you can run quick and go. The goblin is a rare goblin but he is guarenteed to drop it if you see him. There are like  pets he can drop so you cant always get the one you want but I dont think he drops duplicates if you have one. Happy hunting.,D3PS4,dg797ta,3,t5_333c3

11646171,0,t1_dgg3nte,Yeah that sounds about right. Inside rifts and greater rifts only pylons spawn not shrines. Im not  sure but Im pretty certain they only spawn outside of rifts sorta like rainbow and pet goblins ,D3PS4,dgg3vgj,1,t5_333c3

11670393,0,t1_dgis9xc,I reached out to PS Support on Twitter.  They told me that I could cloud download my D game to another console if that console was set as my primary device.  But since the other console I want to play on is in the break room I dont think I should do that to works PS.,D3PS4,dgius90,2,t5_333c3

11709770,0,t3_672yn7,What I do buddy bc I also have an impale I kill  monster maybe  depending on density and I literally run away so the kill streak falls off that way it will spawn a globe. The real trick is keeping that buff up during the rg fight which can be a huge pain. Hope this helpsEDiT I saw where someone said something about  kills Im not sure how many u have to have to spawn the globes buddy but it seems like using my method they usually spawn for me but maybe thats because my previous killstreak was  I will do some testing,D3PS4,dgnbysp,1,t5_333c3
