9119581,0,t1_d87s54y,The servers are really great atm. The easy scripts script. have all been removed AFAIK. The biggest problem is the t harvesting but thats getting fixed tomorrow I believe,hackmud,d880xde,1,t5_3e6gp
9157782,0,t3_55oup2,It would be ton of information to handle. Certainly possible with a corp of people running it. Would be some complex scripting.,hackmud,d8ctdw9,1,t5_3e6gp
9179074,0,t1_d8ffetz,I saw that for auction! This script is gonna be good.,hackmud,d8fijec,1,t5_3e6gp

9417747,0,t1_d99r8bs,A loc bruteforcer is technically possible but realistically infeasible. Were talking over  billion possibilities here. That would be ridiculous if were just talking about one loc getting leaked but it was at least four highvalue locs.And zurich would be very stupid indeed to run anyone elses public scripts. In fact they assured me that they did not. So its very likely to have been an exploit.,hackmud,d99rjg4,2,t5_3e6gp

9728275,0,t3_5eg5cn,NPCs do that from time to time. Nothing weird about it.,hackmud,dac8193,2,t5_3e6gp
9762702,0,t3_5eg5cn,Yes occasionally NPCs will send money to players. Theres not much you can do about it but add it to your bank accounts.  GC is one of the lowest amounts it usually ranges from a couple K to a couple hundred K. It might be relevant to something in the future but who knows what?,hackmud,daggy34,1,t5_3e6gp
