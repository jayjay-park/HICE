8726221,0,t3_4zin5a,This list isnt me telling you what to upgrade but an overview that shows  which units stand out with upgrade so you can decide for yourself where to put your credits. In the first playthrough you most likely wont be able to upgrade everything you want. Giganscudo Duro  not sure if thats the exact translation this time but you cant miss it. The fat pink robot. It has a very powerful map weapon that allows smoother stage clearing and gives you some extra income if you use it right. Prioritize upgrading its weapons and EN. Grungust Type   Hits hard and pretty tanky and has two pilots so double the seishin commands. A great unit all around and you can put pretty much anyone in there. SRXR Gun Powered and DygenguarAussenseiter  Best and second best attack damage in the game. Both can only reach their full potential if you upgrade both mechs in the group and both consume a ton of EN. If you ever find yourself stuck in a stage load the save before it and spend all your money upgrading SRX and RGun. Thatll solve most of the problems in the game.Compatible Kaiser  hits hard has a great subpilot and extremely tanky. Consumes a ton of EN though so its extremely important to upgrade its EN if you decide to use it. Gespenst Haken  this mechs full upgrade bonus gives its final attack extra damage according to its subpilots level. Combine it with Hakens ace bonus and you have one of the highest damage potential in the entire game. Soulgain  I think this is the only mech except the SRX that came out insanely strong and stayed that way in all the sequels looking at you Vysaga and Forte Gigas. Plus its pilot is insanely strong too so its definitely worth upgrading.Bellzelute and Granzon are no brainers and may even ruin your experience by making the game too easy if you fully upgrade them and abuse their overpowered map weapons. Alteisen is fine with its Rampaging Ghost combo attack which actually got buffed a little this time but it suffers from pretty much low everything armor accuracy dodge and HP. Simply put dont leave it in the middle of enemies in later stages it wont survive more than a couple hits.,SRW,d6wf4o9,3,t5_2sg41
10876172,0,t3_5vg0c3,Moon Dwellers is okay not my favorite OG SD Gundam G Gen is fantastic especially if you like UC Gundam since thats all it has sans a few secrets and Im imagining V will also be fantastic and has more then just Gundam obviously. Id say either G Gen or V but I have all  since V is preordered.,SRW,de1sssk,3,t5_2sg41
