Not that I mind considering that I am also planning on trying to start makign reviews atleast once a month along with  lps a week with some extra videos.It is fun to work  hours a day while waiting to receive word from other sources. I still doubt whether I should even make that patreon or not though I do need an actual camera and a microphone. Some actual lighting equipment would also be nice.,ganmue,d0947f4,1,t5_3cn72
