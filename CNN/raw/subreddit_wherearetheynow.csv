But with all due respect how can you not expect people to want talk to him when hes put himself out there in the realm of ideas and the arena of thought provoking perspectives and as fresh and sophisticated such as his and then says he has no wishes to be questioned by anyone it seems halfbaked. I guess you can find these ideas elsewhere and not solely from him and I can appreciate that hes just a guy whose made videos and has said all that he has wanted to say. Thats fine with me. He has cool videos and if you are really married to him thats amazing. Its just that he is a natural person of influence for voicing those type of ideas and which I guess inadvertently created a fanbase because of it. Theres no way to avoid what comes at you once youve done that. ,wherearetheynow,d8js9xi,2,t5_2rfim
