9247987,0,t1_d8o8ale,Im not sure if you are trolling or being serious?  Do you know how hard it is for a college to produce productive NBA players??  Kentucky and Duke have a lot of perceived stars but their development doesnt have much to do with college.  They would be st round picks without college. Hence one and done Take Brice Johnson  Danny Green  PJ Hairston  etc. UNC developed them to succeed as NBA players which by the way... Is a very hard thing to accomplish. ,tarheels,d8o90sy,0,t5_2s54v

10672178,0,t3_5sp3bk,Grayson Allen is probably one of the most hatable Duke players ever. I imagine he is going to do something controversial in one of the games this year. Lets hope he gets put in his place by a dominate UNC team.,tarheels,ddgr5xx,23,t5_2s54v
