2164614,0,t3_2jt7ku,Remember the goal of the lift is to get the crease of your hip below your knee and has NOTHING to do with how low the bar gets.I set you this challengePut around lbs on the bar kg and squat all the way down breaking parallel and come up for a single rep if you can half rep lb for  this should be fine.Once you have done this go up in small increments we have .. kg plates here and perform another rep making sure you hit the bottom of the squat.If you complete the rep add on more weight and go again.The idea is to go until failure. Make sure you hit the bottom of the squat each and every time do not fear failure as it is failure which is stopping you from going deep enough because you are thinking Stop! STOP! STOP!!

It is like you start the lift with your knees almost locked out then bend at the knee as the bar moves up...so the exact opposite of a normal dead lift.

5337412,0,t1_cvqh5wo,This sort of comment is why I havent been on rformcheck in a while. Its totally worthless and it gets upvoted.So heres why the comments worthless. It has nothing to do with the lift at all. Instead of talking about the lift umikewise instead tries to rulenazi that hurrdurr deadlift is a DEAD lift with dead wieeit from da floor.Heres two videos from some of the most widely recognized elite deadlifters. George Leeman and Richard Hawthorne Both use and strongly advocate touch amp go. If umikewise  or anyone else for that matter thinks they know better about training deadlift than these guys sure go ahead and upvote.For OPNothing wrong in the world starting deadlift at any height. You can start it on the floor or from the rack or whatever. People do rack pulls for a reason. As long as your core can handle the shifting balance when youre moving around theres no problem at all.Heres where your problem is. Youre lifting with your back. At the top of the lift you can see your ass is stuck out and your lumbar is hyperextended. This is  wrong deadlift form. The lift is done correctly with your glutes and hamstrings not with your back. By sticking your ass out like that and hyperextending youre removing your glutes from the equation. What youre left with is reefing on your erectors and doing a microsquat.Everything from your hips to your shoulders should remain totally static through the lift. Your primary movers the muscles doing the work are your glutes amp hams. At the top of your lift your hips should be forward and your glutes squeezed tight like youre new in the prison shower. ,formcheck,cvtwwc7,0,t5_2sctd
5361905,0,t1_cvwv13w,in this  you never fully lock out. youre not using your hips at all. still dropping the weight. Your sumo is still just widestance conventional hips are in wrong position. It does show however that theres nothing wrong with your morphology that would prevent you from doing conventional lifts. Also youre jerking the weight every time.Squat form is bad. youre up on your toes. youre twerking. It looks like your knees are travelling straight forward if not actually collapsing inward. It doesnt matter if your knees travel past your toes what matters is the direction they travel. Your toes should point outward a little and knees should track along them. Doing this opens your hips think groin stretch   and lets your body go down between your knees instead of forcing your back to round because your legs are in the way.Post video with a behind angle squat. Still no glutes being used. And also hyperextension.gt after attempting to lower my hips and closer to the bar I would fall lose balance and fall back evident in the videoWhich for sumo is correct. gt Given my poor mobility I find it physically impossible to bring the hips closer to the bar without my knees deviating forwardFTFYThe main thing youre failing on is the most basic principles which unfortunately nobody usually talks about. . Through any lift your spine must stay neutral. Omars video I linked to before gives good breathing techniques that will help with that. . Know what your primary movers are. For deadlift this is your glutes and hams. Youre still not using your glutes for either of your deadlifts. Your hips if youre using them end with your ass squeezed as hard as possible and forward at the top of a lift. Your hips are always back in both squat amp dl.Your  touchless dl is pretty decent except for the glute activation. Get that going work on your ham mobility so you can touch the bar down and your deadlift should be fine.,formcheck,cvx1ljz,1,t5_2sctd

5884868,0,t3_3vtkkn,You are not hitting depth and are your bottom position is very unstable.  Work on your flexibility and with lighter weights.  Perhaps work in pause squats or squat onto a bench so you can get the feeling of a stable bottom position and exploding out of it.  You are not squatting in between your knees but on top of them.  Looks like you are not comfortable in the bottom position.  Those shoes dont look very stable.  Switch to something with a flat sole or squat in your socks. Too much movement in your ankles so this may indicate your weight is shifting around your foot.  You want to spread the floor with your feet.

My recommendation would be to try to squat high bar just until you reach parallel without lumbar flexion and keep trying to get lower week by week.

Pont  implies that a tall squatter should have a vertical back in the squat and forward lean is harmful. This is the reason their backs are hurting the coach doesnt know the movement.Point  says that because an athletes core is weak hell have poor form and have decreased range of motion and the fix is to strengthen the core. I cant even begin to see the reasoning for the decreased range of motion that idea is pulled a full range of motion out of the authors asshole. His athletes dont suffer from weak cores their form is bad because this coach is bad. If you can squat  or  hundred pounds your core sure as hell is strong.Point  This coach would have you believe that somehow high school athletes are so immobile that a bunch of stretches would be more beneficial to than strength training. I hope the athletes thank their coach for their stretches as they head to their yoga and dance classes.Point  The squat is not good because the athletes do not do them correctly.

The squat was one of the hardest for me to learn how to do properly aswell so youre not alone on this.Im going to point out what youre doing wrong and then Ill give you suggestions of solutions for that.gt Depth looks to be an issueYep depth is clearly an issue for you. Youre not going below parallel that is the top of your knee cap is not above the crease of your hip and it should.Im surprised you arent hurting in the top of your knees already because shallow squats usually cause that. Make sure you go below parallel on every single rep. In time it will feel automatic but for now film yourself like you just did and review your depth. Its not realtime feedback but its very close.gt This squat is only lb but I did start with just the bar about  weeks ago so I am progressing.Funny I started having trouble at around kg because I had too much depth. You on the other hand have too little. What matters now is correcting your form because you dont want to progress and hurt yourself because your form sucked thats the last thing you want.gt It appears that I sway forward slightly on the decentNo you dont sway forward slightly. You sway too much simply because you sway. Theres no room for swaying in a low bar.In fact looking from the back your squat doesnt look at all like a low bar squat the place youre putting the bar seems too high on your back youre not breaking at the hips and at the knees during your descent and swaying means the bar is not above the middle of your foot. It should always travel above the middle of your foot.gt my legs look to be pretty unstable?If by unstable you mean theyre not locked when they should then yes.Make sure you lock your hips and knees after each rep.As an additional source of information I suggest you watch this video and pay attention to it because it will make everything much clearer.Cheers!,formcheck,dgqyzxb,2,t5_2sctd
