7653950,0,t1_d3b57yn,Its a issue Ive been morally split on for a while  draw attention to vaping and risk bansrestrictions etc or keep it on the down low for a few to enjoy.Somewhat surprisingly the majority of articles Ive seen lately in NZ media at least have been in support of vaping.Im not holding my breath on the government to take the best steps when it comes to adjusting legislation though.  With bans in Australia and looming restrictions in Europe and the US if those go through I think well be up shit creek really.  Thats where theyll be looking when it comes time to do something about it  our governments never seem to take initiative in this sort of thing and just follow suite with whats been done by others.,nzvapers,d3c7m8p,1,t5_2zmh3
