2656256,0,t1_cn5ao68,Not sure if you are trolling me or not.A gun belt is probably the SECOND most important thing after your choice of firearm. Your holster doesnt matter if you have a shitty belt.A gun belt is usually thicker and MUCH stiffer than a normal belt. It is made to bear the weight and distribute the load of a firearm. If you really want to hear me go off about it you can search my comment history for belt comments. I once made an analogy to a guy who insisted his walmart belt was sufficient that you could use regular hex nuts on your wheels to hold them on but we dont. We use lug nuts instead. Why? The hex nuts may work for a while but when they fail they will fail spectacularly. A regular belt may work for a while but why risk your pistol falling out or your pants sagging or whatever. A proper gun belt is a required piece for the concealed carry set up. It is cheap insurance and makes it much more comfortable to carry.I personally use a belt from Rafter S Gunleather. It looks like a nice plain black dress belt but it is super thick and stiff leather. Some guys perfer operatortacticalpitbulltrexsharknado whatever brand webbed belts and those are fine also. But the bottom line is you need a belt made to carry a pistol with. They usually run  for a good one and it will last a long long time. Im sure some of the guys here or you can search posts can recommend one.,Glocks,cn5avzd,5,t5_2v6xn

2735288,0,t3_2ra7sk,I would say avoid that P ammo unless you are shooting it in a SMG or rifle it isnt an official SAAMI spec and can have serious issues penetrating as deep as a slower round unless the bullet was specifically designed for those velocities which most gr bullets were not. I had several boxes of Federal gr P ammo that came with a Glock  I bought used and eventually sold the ammo because the recoil isnt hard but has some whip out of a Glock  from the two mags I ran.Also you might want to consider gr P rounds in the future if you can order online you can get them for  cents a round depending on brand and gr tend to have better penetration along with reliable expansion. Personally I have gr P Remington Gold Sabers right now for my Glock. I know for a fact that bullet will pass through a full size  lb a market weight size pigs skull and brain then still manage to get lodged in the far side of the neck when fired from a Glock . On two  smaller pigs it went straight through into the ground and left a decent hole on the way out and almost didnt have to cut the throats to drain them.,Glocks,cneznn1,2,t5_2v6xn

3507433,0,t1_cps1njp,Theres really no reason to get a gen unless youre really into collecting different Glocks which I am which is why Im currently searching for a reasonablypriced gen to add to my collection.Theyre not incredibly common to find on the used market but theyre available if you look around. The only available model in the gen configuration is the original fullsize Glock  and some very rare early model Gs. All the other calibers and sizes came with the later generations. Compared to later generation glocks the Gens have a thin pencil barrel that is no longer produced by Glock so you cant swap barrels with any modern glock or aftermarket glock barrel and of course the gen and gen glocks do not have the accessory rail for attaching lights to the dustcovers so in terms of functionality theyre a bit limited compared to the modern gengen glocks. However gen and gen lack finger grooves which is a plus to some. Personally I find the lack of finger grooves and lack of a rail to make the earlier Glocks just look sleeker which is why Id like to add one to my growing collection of tactical tupperware.,Glocks,cps2m6r,3,t5_2v6xn

4067530,0,t1_crjx6op,Nope.  Twice this morning while going through  rounds of the Fiocchi ammo I put the magazine in with  rounds in it.  Fired the first round and the slide locked to the rear while there was still  rounds in the magazine.  I dropped the mag just to make sure there was nothing jammed then put the mag back in racked the slide and the next  rounds in the mag shot fine.Several folks had posted online about similar issues with the G when it came out and I believe Glock changed the slide lock to try to keep it from catching on the bullets and causing the lock back.  Some folks filed down the tab on the slide lock and reported success.  I thought Id just share my experience with the ammo in the G for the benefit of anyone might like to know.  ,Glocks,crjxdm7,1,t5_2v6xn

So if someone breaks into your families home then you need to go and make sure your family is safe.gtBesides what of the further risks involved in clearing a building e.g. the fatal funnel the possibility of being heard and losing any element of surprise the difficulty of keeping your back to a wall while moving as opposed to while remaining still etc?We arent talking about clearing a building we are talking about a home defense situation. You will know you home much better than the person who broke into your home unless you are a navysealsniper and have a foreign government agents sneaking into your home.So on that note I know my house like the back of my hand and I can easily walk around with the lights out which is something robbers or strangers in your house probably would struggle to find their way around a strange house at night.gt Am I wrong in thinking that its better to allow all of your shit to be stolen than to take such unnecessary risks?How do you know they are in there to steal stuff? Did they tell you that? The infamous serial killer Wayne Gracie tied his victims up and told them that he wasnt going to hurt them but only rob their house so most people did put up a fight. He raped and murdered them and their families and didnt steal anything. ,Glocks,d97kvr7,2,t5_2v6xn

When the team looked at shootings in which victims had a chance to defend themselves their odds of getting shot were even higher.While it may be that the type of people who carry firearms are simply more likely to get shot it may be that guns give a sense of empowerment that causes carriers to overreact in tense situations or encourages them to visit neighbourhoods they probably shouldnt Branas speculates. ,Glocks,daj1u3t,22,t5_2v6xn

11128422,0,t1_desw8mh,Im not sure what you are arguing. In the photo his red dot is sitting on top of his front sight post with the iron sights aligned. For something to be cowitnessed it doesnt necessarily have to be zeroed at the same point and its obvious that OPs zero isnt final as he hasnt yet range tested it.     For instance I have an AK with a pkvs red dot. When I look through the irons the dot lines up with the top of the front sight post but the sights are in the bottom  portion of the optic. Its a cowitness but obviously a different type of cowitness than absolute. Its popular for many rifles to come witness like this because you can lift your head a little bit and have the red dot free of the iron sights which makes placing it on target much easier than using it through the sights.        This is called lower third cowitness and gives you the advantage of less visual clutter and the faster acquisition speed of a red dot. Minor drawback is having to adjust cheek weld when switching to irons. Thats why I use it with fixed irons. If I have folding irons then absolute cowitness would be my preference and Id just for the sights when needed.     On a pistol with a red dot absolute cowitness makes less sense as the red dot sight would have to be mounted so low in the slide that the slide would block most of the sight picture with normal size sights. If you just used crazy huge sights to get it to the center of the red dots window the sights themselves would block most of the red dot window and aiming would be just as slow as f you had no red dot in the first place. In either case competition fiber optic front sights with a blacked rear would make much more sense.    Imo OPs setup is quite elegant and gives all the benefits of a low profile red dot for faster and more precise aiming with the redundancy of backup irons should the red dot die.          ,Glocks,deteay0,3,t5_2v6xn
