7694183,0,t1_d3gokq8,Really? That wasnt my experience at all  although I didnt join the tour group. When I went inside the church there was no one else inside and it was a nice place to sit for a moment and collect my thoughts. I am an atheist but I often visit churches for their artistic and historical nature. As such I do my absolute best to be as respectful as possible to the place and any worshippers that might be there. I know not everyone has the same sense of decorum which is unfortunate. I dont know if its frowned upon seeing as Im not Catholic but I often put a couple bucks in the box and light a candle for someone I miss just because I think its a nice thing to do. St. Jerome was certainly interesting and different and the history of the place was fascinating to me. I would be upset if I saw tourists exhibiting the behavior you described as well. Perhaps the informal atmosphere of the pueblo made them feel more free to behave that way? Even so that is incredibly rude. ,churchporn,d3gs1yk,1,t5_2srs2
