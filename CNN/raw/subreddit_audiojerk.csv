396887,0,t3_1ylstb,Dude your setup sounds amazing and dont fear you are almost all the way to getting that blissful analog sound skipfree through your amazing Dr. Dre BeatBox. The problem is the Crosley record players were never designed to accommodate the base waves generated by the beatBox. This of course isnt the fault of the audio engineers at Crosley the base coming out the beatBox actually warps spacetime so any analog device in the room is going to warp as well and this can cause the needle to skip. But there is a simple solution HO!  Water acts as a spacetime damper so all you need to do is fill a large tub with water and submerge the turntable in it.  Some people find this solution hard to believe but dont take it from me test it yourself! Place the tub of water next to the turntable slap some deadmau on the player and note how the slammin base from the beatBox makes the player skip then while its still playing pick it up and place it in the tub of water. I dont think you will hear any more skipping after that.Be sure to let me know how your HO stabilized analogthrubeatBox system works out for you I reckon its going to deliver a sound thats to die for!,audiojerk,cflwj0q,3,t5_2t5zq

2791261,0,t3_2s1mo3,I dont know how to tell you this you might want to sit down. Anyway you where butt raped metaphorically. This man is well known in the audio file community he is an ex Seinhieser employee who was fired for sexual assault. He is delusional and highly predatory. He slipped treble into your drink when you werent looking confusion ear pain and dizziness are a common symptom. As you well known Seinhieser our sworn enemies think the people WANT treble and they do not care for the lives it costs. You will probably find yourself craving treble in the coming days stay strong and resist. Play a  Hz tone every time you feel the urge. You where also physically raped but thats beside the point what maters is he took your innocence. You never do forgot that wretched enticing squeal...,audiojerk,cnlctzn,15,t5_2t5zq
