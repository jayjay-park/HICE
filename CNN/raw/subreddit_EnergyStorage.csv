Lastly in a market like California where energy costs are very high  batteries have a  year return on investment because they offer a large number of services  frequency grid regulation positive and negative peaker general storage etc.,EnergyStorage,cy8f3ms,1,t5_2wfgr

The proper place for energy storage is on the grid to stabilize it against catastrophic or renewables fluctuation. If batteries have a useful value they will benefit from economies of scale. A Powerwall in the home is a fire hazard and with more Powerwall installations one day one of those home will burn down and the lithium will make the situation worse. After that there will be regulations to only allow lithium batteries outside of building in separate nonflammable units. Elon will end up selling grid storage banks to utilities or not selling them at all. ,EnergyStorage,dfq23m6,1,t5_2wfgr
