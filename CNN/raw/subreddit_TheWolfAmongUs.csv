253544,0,t1_cf70wra,Yeah hour and a half for me as well. I dont mind that Snow is still alive in fact Im glad...heh.I did like this episode but I did kinda guess that the creepy guy forgotten his name already had something to do with it  didnt think he would have actually killed Lily though. Now to wait another  months for the next episode!,TheWolfAmongUs,cf718ta,28,t5_2yrhi
276968,0,t1_cf9a9k3,You are right Ive seen the trailers and they dont match Im sure they completely changed the episode during the break between episode  and  and thats why the episode was delayed by  months.But the result is a very short mediocre and without any relevant choice for us players.. ,TheWolfAmongUs,cf9gy3f,3,t5_2yrhi
294227,0,t3_1xfgtq,I bought the season pass yesterday but havent gotten the code yet. It should come in about  hours though if the  hour delay claim is correct probably not. Have you guys just not received it at all?,TheWolfAmongUs,cfb9fxc,1,t5_2yrhi

308303,0,t3_1xlx4v,I dont know if this counts as spoilers or not but for clarification purposes that still not his Big Bad Wolf form. I suppose it would be called something like full Werewolf.,TheWolfAmongUs,cfcq1uq,5,t5_2yrhi
313839,0,t3_1xnala,Thats who Bluebeard was!  There was a charming familiarity to a character who is very unlikeable in print and I couldnt figure it out.  Bluebeard was inheriting latent internal goodwill from Lee.,TheWolfAmongUs,cfdar5x,1,t5_2yrhi
341010,0,t1_cff2iel,I think its definitely the ribbon. I cant remember if Georgie was wearing one though and he said the same thing. I think the ribbon casts some kind of spell that makes it impossible to reveal anything. ,TheWolfAmongUs,cfg4647,1,t5_2yrhi
729295,0,t3_22h32c,Despite how it appears in the show by the time the comics roll around Bigby actually has very good control over his shapeshifting and usually only fully changes if he needs to. Its indicated every time he changes its because he needed to for some reason not because hes necessarily angry or in response to being angry.Edit Remember Bigby is not your typical werewolf. He isnt even technically a werewolf at all s Hes a demigod whos father is the North Wind and whos mother was a wolf. He preferred to take his mothers form growing up and stubbornly refused to learn shapeshifting like his siblings so he pretty much got stuck in wolf form for a long time. At some point Snow White is asked to stab him with a stained lycanthropy knife so he can learn how to shapeshift into a human. He had it in him all along to do this it was just easier to stab him with the knife than to try and teach an old dog a new trick. So now hes able to shift to human to his Big Bad Wolf form and anything in between on command.,TheWolfAmongUs,cgn6aki,5,t5_2yrhi

764775,0,t3_22wqsc,Dont because of the reasons in this comment. It helps with the experience and if telltale doesnt make a wolf among us sequel then go for fables. Because fables comic is more adventure than noir and this is a prequel so it ruins the whole murder mystery shit.,TheWolfAmongUs,cgr7l7p,-1,t5_2yrhi

1404471,0,t1_cis78kw,The fuck you talking about. Having the CM try to talk his way out of it by blaming everybody and then having to win the crowd back is one of the most impressive dialogue in the game. Not only do the crowd doubt themselves but you will also. He actually mindfucked me. But i ripped his head off so he cant talk anymore. ,TheWolfAmongUs,cisbwuo,4,t5_2yrhi

1411180,0,t1_cit5ux9,I guess I should reiterate that it is maybe slightly possible that Nerissa is actually Nerissa at the end and Bigby is just really reading into it. It is strongly suggested this is not the case however. I can live with these two things being open for interpretation aka no one glamoured as anyone and Bigby really met Faith and Nerissa vs him only having met Faith.What I cant deal with is the idea that Nerissa was glamoured as Faith in episode one that makes no sense at all as Ive explained in a few other posts here.,TheWolfAmongUs,cit65wp,0,t5_2yrhi
1411567,0,t1_cit3upu,Nerissa becomes Faith to placate Faith since Faith thinks Georgie will kill her but Nerissa says that he wont.,TheWolfAmongUs,cit7wow,2,t5_2yrhi
1412894,0,t3_2abdic,CM basically told Georgie to deal with it which Georgie interpreted as kill them  or Ill kill YOU.  CM later denies this  but hes that type of guy that seems to always speak in such a way as he can always pull the plausible deniability card after.. Its not possible for him to walk theres four options as to his fate Choke him out at the warehouse.  Instead of taking him to the trial you choke that mofo out right then and there.  The whole trial segment afterwards becomes Bigby on trial if you do this. Twist his head off.  A more violent method which is in keeping with a dark Bigby playstyle.  You rip his head off and throw both pieces down the well much to everyones shock and horror. Throw him down the well.  The humane way of killing him. Imprison him.  Aunty Greenleaf transforms him into a caged bird and he gets taken to the Farm.  He cant actually talk as a bird either.,TheWolfAmongUs,citdvpm,3,t5_2yrhi
1417520,0,t1_cittvy5,To be fair Spoilers Crane attempted to sell out fabletown to the adversary.But yeah that was one of my major beefs with the ending Bigby has pretty much carte blanche when it comes to the security of fabletown as long as he can produce evidence even if it only means a witness or two and yet Spoilers the writers made the whole thing about due process disregarding the fact that there is hard evidence of more than enough criminal activity kidnapping and attempted murder of a public official for one to warrant capital punishment considering how often its dished out in the comic. The only case i can think of of someone committing a seriously heinous crime and living is Hansel and only because there was not enough evidence so he ws struck from the compact and exiled which is pretty much the next best thing and this is just on suspicion of murder. The Crooked Man wouldve been killed without any regard and nobody wouldve given a single shit if they stuck to the comics logic.,TheWolfAmongUs,cityqlw,1,t5_2yrhi

1464158,0,t1_cizqq5f,Im not saying my answer is the correct one. Im saying this is my interpretation.

I told the Crooked Man that I would bring him in and the game didnt give me an option to betray him so he went to trial. I wasnt sure if I wanted to throw him down the well or not but when he suddenly attacked right at the end I decided that imprisoning him would be the better punishment. ,TheWolfAmongUs,cjenvav,1,t5_2yrhi

Not sure why he would later freak out when told shes dead but he was on some drugs so maybe he was passed out for that part.
