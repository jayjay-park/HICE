Part of the reason cars and such are able to is that they are in continuous contact with the surface so there is an effective outward force due to their centripetal acceleration which if its great enough can be sufficient to overcome gravity temporarily.,Eyebleach,cmtv1uf,7,t5_2s427

You can tame a wild animal but domesticating an animal means youve bred it over generations for specific traits.Certainly  years of breeding is not enough to produce many different breeds of domesticated foxes and they dont seem trainable like a dog but those Russian scientists have clearly created a animal that is distinctively different in temperament from a wild fox.

No ones arguing that you little bitch.As someone who has over  confirmed kills I am telling you specifically in the military no one calls SEALs SF. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying Special Operations youre referring to the United States Special Operations Command which includes things from Army Rangers to my secret network of spies across the USA.So your reasoning for calling a SEAL SF is because random people call the gorilla ones SF? Lets get SOW and MRR in there then too. Also calling someone DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six? Its not one or the other thats not how Special Operations Command works. Theyre both. A SEAL is a SEAL and a member of USSOCOM. But thats not what you said. You said a SEAL is SF which is not true unless youre okay with calling all operators of the USSOCOM family SF which means youd call Rangers Pararescuemen and other operators SF too. Which you said you dont. Its okay to just admit youre fucking dead kiddo.,Eyebleach,cuo5xqm,41,t5_2s427

6134005,0,t1_cymhaph,We did domesticate a lot of the animals we eatuse but that isnt necessarily relevant in deciding whether or not what were doing to the animals we eat is okay. I think individuals should have rights not species. Raising animals specifically for the purpose to be killed for food inherently causes them a great deal of suffering and that should really all that matters. We in the west have no need to kill animals for food or clothing so doing so is unethical and in my mind should be viewed just as unethical as if you were to raise and kill a dog cat or even a human in the same conditions. Us using the fact that we breed these animals for the specific purpose of being killed the fact that some humans in the artic circle need meat to survive or that wolves need to eat dear to survive as an excuse for us to go to eat meat every meal just doesnt make sense.   Beans rice potatoes apples and bananas are all much cheaper than meat and just so happen to be healthier and more nutritious. Ive paid less on groceries since going vegan even with all the unnecessary foo foo stuff I buy.  We did domesticate cows but that fact alone doesnt make us eating billions of burgers a year ethical.  ,Eyebleach,cymvehl,0,t5_2s427

I shied away from small rodents for a long time because all the gerbils and hamsters I ever had were biters but none of the rats have ever bitten me hard enough to cause me pain and never on purpose  even when I first brought them home and they were terrified of everything.The only time Ive ever actually been bitten was when this guy who is mostly blind thought the tip of my finger was an extension of the treat I was holding. I yelled in surprise even though it didnt break skin or leave any marks. It took me like a week to get him to take a treat from my hand again haha. I think he was afraid of biting me again.THIS and THIS is Pete and HERE is Harry! Rats are so charismatic and charming.,Eyebleach,czcktrk,2,t5_2s427

They sell some of their foxes to help pay for the research and prevent overpopulation problems but if your not in Russia they are hard to get and expensive. They also spayneuter any foxes that they sell.Anyway there are some breeders in the US who sell domestic foxes that are not these Russian foxes. In these cases what they mean is that they are captive bred which are legal to own in some states you have to get a permit.

Are you just lonely and need attention because of a bad childhood? Are you pretending to be slightly unhinged because you think being mildly annoying is cool or fun? Do you actually think that what you say is anything more than a joke on or about yourself? Absolutely fascinating carry on!

7797685,0,t1_d3sfta7,There are plenty of reasons why people put clothes on their animals. For instance animals with short hair that live in cold regions need something to stay warm when they are outside so they dont shiver uncontrollably. Also sometimes putting a sweater on a dog helps them relax if they are feeling anxious. The pressure on their body helps them. There are worse things than putting clothes on an animal. It doesnt hurt them. ,Eyebleach,d3sipxd,1,t5_2s427

9393238,0,t1_d96jij0,Its actually more complicated than that. The mewing sound that cats make is normally only used when they are kittens to get the attention of their mother. Its never used by adult cats when they interact with each other. Adult cats will communicate with each other mostly nonverbally. Thats why you often see them staring at each other.However cats at some point started using the mewing sound to get the attention of humans. Its theorised that this happened because whilst adult cats will keep their eyes on each other all the time humans will pay very little attention to a cat and thus miss all the nonverbal ques. Cats therefore learnedevolved to get their humans attention with the same verbal cue they used as kittens.,Eyebleach,d96nr26,54,t5_2s427

9685826,0,t1_da6stfg,gtBy the numbers per population wolfdogs bite less often than pitbulls as a breedYou and a few other people need to work on your selective reading. To answer your source there are a few problems with the data. Chiefly it doesnt list a source. Secondly and more importantly the data supports my stance. Wolf Hybrid is often the most misreported data in the world and while youre right that there are very few actual wolfdogs compared to something like a pitbull there are a lot of huskies and other arctic breeds that are often mistaken and labeled as a wolfdog by the owner because the owner is undereducated.You said that wolfdogs have caused the th most human fatalities of any other breed  this isnt true but it fits what people expect out of the narrative. Your source lists  deaths attributed to wolfdogs in the past  years while in the same time frame pitbulls have been responsible for  deaths and huskies a breed commonly mistaken for a wolfdog have been responsible for  deaths. If wolf content creates a more dangerous breed it would stand to reason that wolfdogs would bite more often than one of the most common base breeds of the mix.Wolfdogs are not a good animal for the vast vast majority of people to own. But they also are not the dangerous unpredictable terror everybody on Reddit likes to make them out to be. ,Eyebleach,da6zens,0,t5_2s427

I remember waking up after crashing of course from drinking and I couldnt remember where my phone was.  Well it dawned on me that it was out back.

I dont think they could see CRT TVs very well because scan lines turned it into a mess for them iirc. Same problem doesnt exist for LCD or LED tvs.Whether its just moving colors to them or they think its moving patterns no idea.

10923167,0,t1_de6ih3f,Ive had very similar experiences.  One of my three Smacky was adopted from a shelter.  Smartest animal Ive ever met.  Uses tools listens to conversations makes eye contact and talks a lot.Biggest breakthrough ever was recognizing their dietary needs as carnivores and feeding accordingly.  For the past eight years I use a frozen chicken formula balanced with raw vegetablebased ingredients for a full prey profile and the results are incredible.Hydration is key benefit typical urinary problems nonexistent.  No odor to litter box at all.  Efficient process of food yields rabbitlike poops.  Lean muscular cats with thick silky fur.  All of this for recognizing their true nature and embracing it.The downvotes from my initial comment make me wonder if some misread my intent.  The link about cheetah pets echoed my observations about the predatory nature of cats but theres ZERO negativity attached.  If I die in my sleep Smacky Biskit and Bosko are welcome to eat my face first.  They deserve it.,Eyebleach,de6nd06,6,t5_2s427
