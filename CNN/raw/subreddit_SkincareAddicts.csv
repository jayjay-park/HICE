3585311,0,t3_31emtv,From my experience LUSH products are very aesthetically pleasing i.e. they smelllook nice. But thats it. I have tried quite a few of their products including skincare haircare and bath stuff. The bath bombs give you a nice experience and I really like this one particular thing that I always buy on sales So White bath bomb and I love how it makes my whole bathroom smell amazing.However the skin and hair products Ive tried have been way too harsh and had ingredients that make me cringe now. Besides the sales assistants make everything sound like its gonna fix all your problems but it seems like they dont know anything about skincare. Like ooh you have sensitive skin? TRY THIS CREAM WITH A SHITLOAD OF ESSENTIAL OILS THEYRE SO SOOTHING. Well thats not a real quote but you get my point.To be honest having spent so much money at LUSH is one of my biggest regrets in life.

5101189,0,t3_3kvb5z,Honestly what has been most helpful to me is the full routine of washing face using a nonalcohol toner like witch hazel and then a light gel based moisturizer.  You might also want to experiment with how you shave.  Im a woman but from what Ive witnessed my male friends go through shaving can also add to skin irritation if the skin underneath isnt properly cared for.    However for you if you want stuff more easily accessible I would say the Cerave Cleanser Thayers Witch Hazel and Nivea creme.  Now youd need to apply the Nivea at night and then probably rise it off in the morning because it is thick and not gel at all.  Even with an oily face you need to moisturize it and if you need something easily accessable that I can attest to this is about it.  I also have used Cliniques dramatically different gel and liked it although others dont.    Currently I am on a koreanasian skincare kick and have been loving the polish it has given my skin.    If I had a little more info about your current routine what youve tried budget and accessibility needs I could give more pointed recommendations but the current ones are based on what I could do at .,SkincareAddicts,cv0vted,2,t5_37kq2

5637234,0,t3_3sbq6x,I get rosacea flare ups regularly and I find that its best to be gentle. I really love good oil or balm cleansers because I find theyre a lot less harsh on my skin especially when Im trying to be delicate. I also try to steer clear of fragrance or essential oils. Generally the simpler the better. I find keeping my skin moisturized going light on makeup and keeping your makeup formulations sans fragrance too and fishflaxseed oil Omegas help.

5672764,0,t3_3s9xp0,Change your diet. What are you currently eating?Cut out carbohydrates and sugars. These spike your insulin levels which create breakouts. I recommend you go on the paleo diet drink a lot of water and dont wash your face more than twice a day. I only use water to wash my face and have seen tremendous improvements just by going on the paleo diet.Acne is a problem inside the body not from outside the body.

5721904,0,t3_3semv5,Possible triggersdental products face washes detergents foodYou can try varying those products to see if you can pinpoint any triggers.I know my toothpaste irritated me for a period.Solutions take a multivitamin and mineral.  sometimes nutrition deficiency can cause or make it worse after cleansing with something gentle use a cream like eucerin on it.  It has urea in it so it draws moisture out from the inner layers of your skin rather than just being a barrier to slow evaporation. Give that a few moments to soak in and be absorbed.  Then apply something heavier.  I prefer lanolin that has been cut with some oil so the consistency is more like vaseline  otherwise i find the texture is too thick and as u try to spread it it can drag and rip delicate skin.  I got mine from ebay. If you cant find that then AampD ointment has lanolin in it but also has petroleum jelly and fragrance. This might be horrid but lard i found was great and had staying power as long as nothing touches your lips.   Are you ingesting enough fat in your diet?  I find tallow lard coconut hemp avocado and olive oil all improved the dryness of my skin  ingested or applied. You can mix several products and make something yourself if you are motivated. Do you notice a difference when ingesting vinegar or things with tannins like tea?  They dry my skin so i am careful with them but that might just be me.,SkincareAddicts,cx6cxfe,1,t5_37kq2

Stop using products with bad alcohols and keeplook for fatty alcoholsespecially in your moisturizer. Fatty alcohols help your skin retain moisture. I found this article informative on types of alcohols  Cleanse Tone Moisturize should be your minimal routine. Heres what I use Cleanser Neutrogena OilFree Grapefruit cleanser Toner Dr. Thayers Alcohol Free Witch Hazel  Rose Petal. My friends and I all with different skin types and sensitivities love it. We buy in bulk and distribute to each other. Thayers Alcoholfree Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera   oz Moisturizer A friend of mine gave me a spa gift pack from their trip to Iceland a few years ago. It mostly sat in my cabinet untouched until recently when I started using the moisturizer on a whim. It has by far been the most effective product I have used on my skin that has retained moisture and reduced my acne. I will continue to use it until I find something comparable and more cost effective. The effect that moisturizer had on my skin has completely changed the way I take care of my skin and what I look for in product ingredients. Ultimately your skincare routine should be catered to you and your skin. Keep an eye on ingredients and  introduce new products slowlygiving yourself  weeks between introing or removing products from your routine before moving on to the next one. Give your skin time. ,SkincareAddicts,db7wlex,3,t5_37kq2

10645138,0,t3_5sa4nu,Its called Keratosis Pilaris or KP. MILLIONS of people have this.  I dont know the exact cause or physiology behind it but basically the keratin in the skin goes into overdrive and encases the hair.  There is no cure they will always be there.  Treatments include              Spa treatments you can get are Dermabrasion Microdermabrasion Chemical peels.  At Home     I have a PMD Personal Microdermabrasion Device I use at home works like a charm.     In the shower also gently use a loofah.  You never want to get to the point of bleeding though.        Always keep the area very moisturized so as to keep the keratin soft.  using a lotion with chemical exfoliants like AHA or Lactic Acid.  Soft keratin is a lot easier to remove than its untreated form. ,SkincareAddicts,dddypzz,5,t5_37kq2

10706633,0,t3_5rugs6,Echoing retinolvitamin A. The stuff you find in the drugstores wont be potent enough to create any changes. Your derm might carry a medical grade line like ZO which technically are prescription products or prescribe tretinoin which can be kind of harsh by itself so make sure you have a good moisturizer to balance things out. Be very !! careful with vitamin a as it makes your skin more sun sensitive. Only apply it at night and of course keep it up with the sunscreen. Keep using the vitamin c its great at preventing photo damage.Be wary of drugstore products especially ones with buzz words. They probably dont carry enough of the active ingredients here in Canada theyre capped for how much actives they can put in. But if you find a good brand you can look for products with ceramides supports skin barrier function hyaluronic acid supports skin barrier function matrxyl  antiaging peptide andor vitamins a the best b soothes c antioxidant and e antioxidant. ,SkincareAddicts,ddkb5eg,1,t5_37kq2
11019171,0,t3_5wmmv7,I have very dry skin as well and it sounds like youre not giving yourself enough moisture. The CeraVe AM Moisturizer is not giving you adequate hydration. Its likely you should try something heavier which sounds crazy due to the acne but trust me. I use the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream and seal it with an oil. Try adding a serum to your routine. Even an oil youd be surprised. Also as someone with dry skin foaming cleansers really strip the skin and dry it out. Use a cream cleanser cleansing oil or just something more gently like the Fresh Soy Cleaner or Philosphys Purity Made Simple. Lastly drink more water youd be surprised how much hydrating your body can help the skin. ,SkincareAddicts,degzqj3,1,t5_37kq2

11527629,0,t3_64gxfd,Moved to canada after living in europe most of my life. It may be a climate thing but also might just be your age.  Id say make sure all your products are gentle and fragrance free. Check them on beautypedia.com Although youre oily make sure youre moisturizing and using spf after your salicylic.  Id also recommend not using a manual scrub over acne as it can irritate and inflame it further.  Of you find your salicylic isnt working after a few weeks. Try paulas choice bha products. I think most people have sucess with those.   Best course of action in my opinion is a gentle cleanse exfoliantchemical moisturie and spf.  Once your acne starts to heal you can move on to things to help with pigmentation and whatever else. Take care.,SkincareAddicts,dg2npz3,2,t5_37kq2
11594839,0,t3_65h6ny,Im  live in Australia figured that would help with the advice in terms of what products are available I drink water every day at least try to drink enough. I mostly avoid oily fried foods I wash and moisturise my face twice daily. My skin is rough and bumpy but is worse around my chin and cheeks thats where I get my bad break outs its never random. I used to be over weight and my skin was actually quite nice back then so I dont know if Ive done something to make it this way. I try and stick with a cleanser and not chop and change too much because my skin tends to not like change. Most recently I started using Biore charcoal cleanser. My moisturiser is sukin mattifying. In the past Ive used products such as Burts bees Avocado and oatmeal clay masks Yes To range Rose extract cleanser tea tree oil toners Phisophex Proactiv you name it and most of them just either stop working or cause a worse break out. I had a theory that maybe because I was excessively drinking orange juice that the high sugar content was causing the break out but I havent had any for a few weeks now and it hasnt made much of a difference.My face is usually dry and oily but I also have very large pores. Any advice would be great.  ,SkincareAddicts,dgaa7rg,3,t5_37kq2
11598482,0,t1_dgamw2t,By comparing the ingredients and the expected results of both products. I always check out ingredients and claims before I buy any skincare products and put it on my face. I believe this is something most people do. We all do some kind of research and have some kind of expectation before purchasing a product.Everything in the post is information gotten from the respective product pages on the brand websites and I just pointed out similarities and differences in ingredients and claims from the information on the brand websites.I explicitly stated which product I own and have tried and my experience with it. Thankfully its free to look things up for yourself on the internet so you can always verify the information yourself. You certainly dont have to take my word for it. ,SkincareAddicts,dgap32j,1,t5_37kq2
11633240,0,t1_dgemb7p,Right now Im using the Sunday Riley C.E.O. C  E Protect and Repair Moisturizer. I havent tried any vitamin C serums though I want to. The C.E.O. moisturizer has highpotency advanced vitamin C THD ascorbate. When I bought it the woman at Sephora really sold me on it even though a lot of reviews say its great for dryness which isnt a huge concern of mine. But she let me know its a lot of vitamin C which is what I really wanted in a nighttime moisturizer. Its  but they released a set where you get four small sizes of their products for . So I have a small sampleish size of it currently. If I keep seeing improvements in my hyperpigmentation Ill splurge on the  dollar full size. ,SkincareAddicts,dgen26t,1,t5_37kq2
