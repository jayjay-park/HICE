309952,0,t3_1vkwfp,If youre serious about shaping up  which you seem to be Ill give you a little advice. Take photos of yourself on a regular basis maybe once every  weeks or so. Just a full frontal relaxed and maybe a bicep flex or similar what ever you feel comfortable doing.The thing is that you wont see your progress in the mirror. People around you might notice and tell you stuff like youre thinner or youve got bigger arms. Your clothes might get another fit. But its very hard to see that yourself in the mirror. So thats when you go back and start comparing pictures.Good luck!,fitness30plus,cfcw7s4,2,t5_2zswl

Realistic to outrageous back when you were younger to now just write them all down. Wanna be able to deadlift my bodyweight wanna be able to do a pullup want to open jars without struggle want to climb stairs without getting winded want to wash my clothes on my stomach etc.Keep that in the front of your notebook and touch on themupdate themcross them out as you discover new ways to work out. Start on the easier ones obviously and keep working. Want to be able to deadlift my bodyweight  start strength training. Wanna be able to do a pullup  begin a greasing the groove routine.Sometimes people have trouble figuring out what their goals are until they just lay them all out on the table.TLDR write everything down fitnessrelated you always wanted to accomplish no matter how long ago you came up with it and no matter how ridiculous.

455147,0,t1_cfrzljc,Variability is normal and if you are asymptomatic then there is no reason to begin supplementation. For all you know your T is higher now than it has ever been in your whole life.  Also it is not the case that plasma T is particularly important as most of it will be bound to various proteins serum albumin SHBG etc. and therefore not active. Free testosterone is the diagnostic variable of interest and the testosteronetoestrogen ratio is also very important.  In order to help your doctor have your blood drawn as early in the day as you can. Get a good nights sleep the night before eat plenty of good foods lay off alcohol or any other drugs for at least the week before try to minimize any life stresses etc. This will give you a best case scenario so you can be better informed about where you stand.,fitness30plus,cfrzyyh,2,t5_2zswl

This spring I started running again and got about a quarter mile before I pulled up lame. Same damn knee but worse than last fall even after all of the elliptical use and strength training legs look good but my knee still sucks.

I try to go in about  days a week at lunch so right now I only have about  minutes to actually work out takes the rest to get over there change then shower and head back.I have been starting by walking  mph incline for  minutes to warm up. I stretch then do weight machines for  minutes then walk for a couple of minutes and stretch again. I have also tweaked my diet to limit calories white carbs and sugar and get more fruits and veggies in. Long term I would like to get really strong. But right now I feel I should get rid of the pooch and get some basic muscle tone so when I go heavier on the lifting I dont hurt myself. I have dropped about  lbs in a few weeks doing this and have seen a nice increase in what I can lift comfortably. I started this week doing two turns at each machineone of  reps as heavy as I can go then a lighter one and do   reps. When am I ready to start lifting hardcore and should I drop the machines and go to free weights? Would it be best to just hire the private trainer for a couple of sessions to learn my way around the weight room? It is very intimidating especially with all the muscle bound guys lifting s of pounds. I am an old lady who is pretty weak at this point. Thanks for any help!,fitness30plus,cin4yqh,1,t5_2zswl

Go to pubmed or web of science and spend some time searching reproductive ecology humans or preferential fat use lactation brain or some such combination of terms. Here is off my head information  the idea that just fat is related to menstruation is called the Frisch hypothesis and is inaccurate or an incomplete picture  but fat is part of the equation. Read Ellisons On Fertile Ground if youre interested in this. Or look at work by Jasienski Ellison Vallegia Nepomansky Vitzhum for general information about how energy interacts w reproductive profiles of women. Im a biological anthropologist  I dont study this I work in immune function but Im surface level familiar with a lot of the literature and work closely with folks who do study human reproduction and energetics from an evolutionary perspective. Pregnancy and lactation are closely related to energetics of which body fat is a part. There is a lot of work that looks at energy flux balance and stores in relation to a womans hormonal profile reproductive effort and lactation capabilities. There are also natural experiments w things like starvation. Theres a bunch of animal work that Im less familiar with. This is not a controversial position  women store fat to support lactation and pregnancy preferentially from the thighsbutt region. There are other reasons to store fat of course and those combine to create the phenotype of any given person.

2853390,0,t1_cnog4rd,Sorry for belated reply. Cant live on the internet you know. I wouldnt jump right into heavy anything. Aim for  rep sets and increase the weights while dropping the reps as you feel able. Like over the period of weeks to months. Thats what I recommend and what I do. Others certainly would start right out with  rep sets or whatever. Its highly subjective. Anything is better than nothing!,fitness30plus,cnsfixm,1,t5_2zswl

2997210,0,t3_2uhvvu,First things first.  Theres nothing wrong with not liking cardio and the truth is you dont have to do it if you dont want to.  I too loathe cardio and aside from when I play tennis I just dont do it and my body looks exactly the way I want it to without doing ANY steady state cardio.Truth is cardio is not required to melt the fat offyour diet is combined with weightresistance training to retain muscle and ensure that the bulk of your weight loss is fat only.  Therefore the fact that you enjoy weight lifting is great because that is what you should be focusing on with your workouts anyway while your diet handles the actual fat loss.  Its also good because the key to sticking with a workout program in life is finding one that you enjoy doing.  If you start to dread your workouts eventually youre going to stop.  So do what you enjoy in the gym.As far as being intimidated or having social anxiety if you have the room in your home get yourself an adjustable bench a pair of adjustable weight dumbbells and maybe a doorframe pullup bar.  Between those things youll have everything you need to do complete workouts in the privacy of your home with no one ogling you or feeling self conscious.In terms of diet you are on the right track to be focused on that because that is what will make or break your results.  Especially since youre a vegetarian I highly suggest getting yourself a good protein powder to make protein shakes and supplement your regular food intake.  If you can eat dairy I suggest a whey protein powder but if not there are many good hemp pea or rice protein powders out there.Also do you eat eggs?  Eggs are a fantastic protein source so get those in there if you can.In terms of meal planning if you can do it that is great.  If not tracking your calories and macros with an app like Myfitnesspal is key.  One other option to explore is a healthy meal delivery service.  There are tons popping up in most cities these days where you pay to have them deliver your meals for the day or week and most offer vegetarian plans.  Just Google meal delivery and the name of your city to see what may be offered to you.  Its a little more expensive but it takes all the guesswork out and it also helps remove temptation of boredom eating or emotional eating.In any case if you have any questions feel free to ask and I wish you the best of luck!,fitness30plus,co8npnp,1,t5_2zswl

If you wait  weeks between lifting then youll get doms every single time. Ive always felt it was caused by new movements. It goes away and eventually you wont get any soreness no matter how hard you work out. Creatine  I dont take it. Ever time I do my hair begins to thin. Vitamin d Zma fish oil multivitamin are what I take. The multi because dem vitamins fish oil because Im over  and worry about my joints since Im active. Zma was a recommendation from a doc after fertility issues and it worked. Vitamin d was just a whim after reading an article about how most adults are low.

4582354,0,t3_3drlq3,Pretty much any of the popular heavy lifting programs floating around reddit will definitely hit your lower back pretty hard via the DL and Squats rows overhead press etc SS SL GSLP etc etc. Planks are always great and require zero equipment and are pretty safe if done right. Hyperextensions andor good mornings will target the lower back directly.From a lifestyle perspective yardwork is also often quite good at extended hamstring and lower back workouts. Weeding digging etc. On a related note you could probably use your kid as a weight for some of this stuff.

When you have mobility issues with a mobility jointshoulders stress is transferred to a stability jointelbows.  Are you doing pullups or chins by chance because those are exercises that demand some shoulder mobility. Ive had issues with pull ups.  I would start with shoulder dislocations.  Theres also some Mark Rippetoe advice about  sets of one pull up which I think might be good but not for the reason he gives.

I follow the warmup linear progression and deload plans as designed along with minute treadmill warmup and some stretching of calves hamstrings and quads before squat sets.I am an engineering desk jockey who loves food so I have to battle the middle age spread daily. I have been fairly active most of my life including regular machine weight training as well as skateboarding and mountain biking. However about  years ago I realized that I was plateuing on the pulleys and weight stacks and not really getting any stronger.  I was also plagued with minor shoulder pain and lower back pain that had been around since my s. So about  years ago I decided it was time for a change and looked into several barbell programs eventually settling on SLx.Although I still had some shoulder and back pain for the first year of SL in the past  months the pain has been pretty much nonexistent. I have not experienced any joint issues thus far either. I am convinced that the squats and deadlifts have been particularly beneficial in eliminating my back pain.I am just about at the end of SL since all my lifts are at x. My current working maxes  reps are  SQ  DL  OHP  row and  bench. Bench has been particularly difficult to get past a plateau.I am considering the Wendler  as the next stage in my training and hope it will help me to break through some plateaus continue improving strength and avoid any old man joint ailments.,fitness30plus,d7t5jr4,1,t5_2zswl
