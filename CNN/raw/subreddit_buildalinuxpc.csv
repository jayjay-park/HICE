Can you go ahead and submit a self post with a title along the lines BUILD COMPLETE GAMING  Intel i with Nvidia TI with the appropriate info?   I want to get peoples ideas on a template for golden builds. At the moment I think we should have the following at a minimum  a list of components using PcPartPicker like rbuildapc   Linux installsetup tips if there are gotchas   Any bugsissues with links to upstream bug reports driver issues etc,buildalinuxpc,cpj5mb9,3,t5_37ftz
3430196,0,t1_cpj9870,You dont need any wiring between the picoPSU and the power brick. You plug the power prick into the pico and it feeds it power. The picoPSU has no PCIE pins because it wasnt made to feed a GPU. It has  Molex  Sata  CPU and it is a  pin in itself. Im really curious how you will get a pin power to the GPU. Like I said Ive used it in a build and Im struggling to see how you will give the GPU power. The pico can only provide W of power too W peak which would leave barely any headroom.This is how you feed it power On the picture its mounted to a backplate did not come with the psu.,buildalinuxpc,cpj9nun,3,t5_37ftz
