7877964,0,t1_d41j6qr,It would have. I agree and I cant help but smile. Sometimes I think that if mom hadnt died life wouldve been so much better. But then I realise I never would have met you. And if dad hadnt died we never wouldve come here. Met all these people. The guild. Everything would have just been a hazy dream.

8043673,0,t3_4pc8es,I proceed to the location described. After some time I see a creature that matches the description I was given. When it sees me with my IronMake Sword in hand it cowers in fear and begins to retreat away.Crap... I mumble.  ... and apparently it doesnt respond well to voices.  It appears to still have its attention fixed on me though it is hard to tell.I throw my sword to the ground and it dematerialises.  Please I dont mean any harm.The creature stops but doesnt approach.Can you talk or..?The creature shapeshifts and takes on the appearance of a woman.  Please leave me... you have all made attempts on my life... I dont want to fight. The last person I spoke to pretended to trust me and then tried to kill me... You all fail and end up leaving with me hurting...I ask if I can come closer and she makes a mark on the ground and steps back two paces she tells me I can come as close as that mark. We both sit down.I clear my throat and speak gently.  Who are you and how did you get here?I have no name I dont know where Im from I dont know how I got here... I cant remember  cant remember anything. it responds.Well Im Dash. I was sent to kill you but I swear on my familys name that I will do whatever I can to not do so.Dash... you are no better than those who tried to kill me I can feel your hatred deep down.Im taken aback... it can see inside me. Is this why people want it dead?  I... Ive harbored hatred all my life but my sister has kept me right for years now Im now a master of a legal guild. My hatred pales in comparison with the responsibility I have. I will not dishonour my sister or my guild by acting on my hatred unprovoked.The look on its face is impossible to read.  I believe you. Something feels true about that I dont know what. You have no worries about me provoking you.If you dont mind my asking... How do you understand and have the ability to communicate when it seems you are so removed from the human world?It grins  I must have learned how to at some point. I have zero recollection of it though.... But you came here to kill me right?I slouch.  Thats why I was sent here. People dont understand you you have scared children and have been spoken of as a dangerous monster by those who failed to take your life.So why did you come to kill me?I didnt really. I knew that we dont understand you. I hoped I would gain an understanding of you. You dont deserve to be killed without reason.It switches back to its original form  Maybe there is something I have done which I do not remember. But if Im honest all Ive wanted was to die. People have been unable to. Ive just been hurt a lot.Im shocked.  So... you want a painless death?But I suspect Im a victim of a curse or dark magic of some kind. I feel like Im a ghost but Im not immaterial I have a physical form I feel pain... I remember nothing but remorse.What if you inflicted this on yourself as a result of your guilt? You have incredible power coming from you.It shrugsMy eyes narrow.  Whoever did this you must have been a human before... and this prolonged life of isolation stigma and pain must be the punishment.It switches its form back to the form of the woman.  I dont see how that helps me though.I have an idea Im not sure but it might work. Well maybe you did something that you should be guilty for but what you have been through is punishment enough for almost anything...Its gaze is fixed on my eyes as if somewhere deep down it knew that I was on to something.I continue...  So I forgive you. Please let go of this guilt you deserve to live.She begins to glow as the magic appears to flee from her being. A tear appears in her eye.  I remember... Thank you.  Theres a bright light after she says this and when the light fades she is dead in front of me free at last. There are marks on her arms and probably many under her clothes too this must be a result of the attacks she has endured.I fight back tears this experience is one I will never forget. I have witnessed the evil that magic can be used for even if it was to a criminal. I dont know what she was but I was her first friend in a long time. Her life finally saw a glimmer before she passed away the look on her face will never leave me.,Fairy_TailRP,d4k6nzp,1,t5_3cbdo
