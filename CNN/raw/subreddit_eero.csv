Im trying to move my secondary unit to my entertainment center to give my TV and Apple TV a wired connection. They arent doing well wireless as of late although they are in direct line of site of the main gateway. The entertainment center is generally metal so Im trying to move it around to see what area gets the best signal.,eero,d1dbahg,1,t5_36cnf

8117551,0,t3_4qdj2z,Response to my inquiry about speed test  Britany Roberts eero Customer Support Jun   PM CDT Thank you for writing in. I apologize that you are having trouble with the speed test in our app. Unfortunately the discrepancy with the speed test may be due to our servers having trouble and we are aware that the test can sometimes fluctuate. We are working to make the speed test as accurate as possible. Our speed test in general is much more strict than most other speed test platforms based on how it works and how we test. If you do get lower results with our speed test than you would with others that is pretty normal. I would suggest that you connect a PC to the back of your modem and test the speed using speedtest.net. Then connect a PC to back of the eero via ethernet and test the speed using speedtest.net to get a better account of your speeds. I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.,eero,d4shhti,2,t5_36cnf

9217446,0,t1_d8i45ro,Im having this same problem have had for a while.  I asked the same question about log access and support said no but yet support asked for timestamps of when the problem occurs so they can look into it. I assume that means they have far more access to my node then I do. Likewise they have stopped investigating. I dont think they have any insight into the problem and gave up for now to deal with more readily solved problems. ,eero,d8kdnt6,1,t5_36cnf

9685491,0,t1_da6uh6g,I agree. Although gateway isnt too technical. Its the distinction thats down to a technicality and Id say somewhat pedantic.In the end if you just make Primary and Gateway synonymous everywhere including this sub then itll be fine.

Im not sure how Eero would treat this message typeIt would  filter it completely as it would likely trip the STP filter on all pre.. versions  pass it through in .. and ..  probably drop it in .. as the filter is more specific there  pass it through in .. but apply antiloop filtering and optionally filter it completelyThis is all academic because your switch should not be passing them through to eero in any case.,eero,dclu48k,1,t5_36cnf

10861290,0,t3_5v6qq8,There are certain causes of update failures that may require supports intervention. They have a little more control over the update process and additional options like utilizing the secondary partition in case something is wrong with the primary. As mentioned by others they can and will get you sorted out in minutes and they are very friendly and helpful. ,eero,de09kbn,1,t5_36cnf
