I figured it out though so for instance you have unlocked the car you hit use the wheel to equip the moltovs then hit RB to pull them out and then use RB to cycle through your different equipment.  When in the wheel it will be white not red if you can use it.,Homefront,czxk6yc,0,t5_2sbqu

9589302,0,t1_d9unlpy,Its interesting how Homefront TR scraps everything from the original Homefront game  apparently the devs had little interest in it  but theyve gone and kept Walker from the tiein novel. The events of the novel didnt happen or at least they happened a bit differently in this timeline but the character is intact.The second DLC just came out and is a sequel to the main game and features Ethan who can suddenly talk now thanks to negative feedback over him being mute on a misson to assassinate or rescue Walker.,Homefront,d9v2skh,1,t5_2sbqu
