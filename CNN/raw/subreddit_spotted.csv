8982580,0,t1_d7r8rbq,Manufacturers regularly take their cars up Mount Evans because it has the highest paved road in North America They like to test them at altitude.As a result we get to see a lot of these types of cars in Colorado. My parents live just a couple of minutes away from one of the turn offs for Mount Evans road and I see new cars heading that way on a consistent basis when I go visit them. In January or February I looked over and the car sitting next to me was a Jaguar SUV. It took me a second or two to realize that the Jaguar FPace was still months away from being released.Theres a gas station in Bergen Park Evergreen CO that regularly has cars coming through that are mules or are wrapped in a disguise or are still a couple of months from release. Edit This picture isnt taken at Mount Evans. Just commenting on why we get to see so many cool unreleased cars here in Colorado.,spotted,d7rkh3c,16,t5_2u3hz
