They look more at peoples backgrounds life stories than they do race. As for majors College of Letters amp Science do not consider your prospective major in acceptance. For the Film school you apply after taking several classes in Film around the end of your sophomore year. So this should not impact your acceptance to UCLA either.Good luck!,ucla,cfye2rg,1,t5_2qscu

616375,0,t3_2120wa,Hey! Firstly congrats on being admitted to UCLA!Im a current freshman working on a bioengineering major and like you do not plan to go to medical school. BE at UCLA consists of two different tracks that I believe you declare at the end of  years correct me if Im wrong upperclassmen. The two tracks are . regenerative medicine and biomaterials and . biomedical devices. So you should be looking into number  after a few quarters here which coincidentally is what Ill be doing too. Once the school year begins you actually have about  quarters to decide what you want to do because most lower division classes are the same amongst the engineers. Bioengineering at UCLA has been... hard to say the least supposedly it is extremely challenging but the teachers are wonderful and helpful and research is really easy to get into. Dont worry about jobs because job growth in the field is pretty large regardless of what you are doing you can check out the government site BLS to find out more about overall occupational statistics. Overall though someone with a bioengineering undergraduate degree from UCLA with perhaps a little research or internship experience should be able to secure a job. And with more schools offering this degree or an equivalent the field looks as though it will eventually branch off and require a BE undergraduate degree for most jobs. Experience seems to be what employers are looking at If you are looking to get into graduate school UCLA engineering offers ESAP which guarantees you graduate admission back into UCLA if you fulfill certain academic reaches. Overall my experiences with the program as well as the school as a whole has been wonderful. Do what you think will interest you not what you or others think will be the easiest degree or provide the most lucrative occupations. If you want to read up some more Ill post up a few links and you can PM me if you have any specific questions because spring break!!! Again congratulations and have a great senior year!,ucla,cgac02m,2,t5_2qscu

For the English department one of the requirements is that you take a senior seminarcapstone class theyre essentially the same format I dont know why there are two different labels. Its basically a small  students discussionheavy class that meets once a week. For English capstone classes you usually are required to do a longer research paper or some other project. It can be a good opportunity to get more in depth with a topic youve already studied or even one you dont know much about.

1144655,0,t1_chyct7s,Nah I thought you were trying to say that you were assuming that you were more competent in mathematics just because you were at UCLA. Thats all. Im not saying every school is the same or professor is the same. But heres the kicker theres no way to check. You assume berkeley is more rigorous because its berkeley their name has given you a free pass and the benefit of the doubt yet some school in the backwoods of georgia at some small JC could have the toughest professor out there but people would never know because people like yourself assume that UCLA etc is tougher by virtue of the name and the image of prestige created by persons who walked that campus before you. So you are vicariously living through their reputation. And this is how schools keep their name.I hear alot of people saying my school is taught by professors at the top of their field yet everyone says their professors at their particular school is at the top of their field. So where im getting at is that you have no objective criterion in which to verify the rigor of one class as opposed to the other only the name. And you being in a technical field know this isnt a valid way to judge anything on since its vague.,ucla,chydw52,0,t5_2qscu

1239501,0,t3_289ekw,If you think youll be using the metro bus a lot probably several times a week not just on weekends I would recommend getting a monthly pass. Metro doesnt use transfers. You have to pay the full fare each time if you take two buses or a bus and a train and that can really add up. Passes are loaded onto what they call a tap card. Theyre used on the metro buses and trains theyre the only accepted fare on the trains. Note that Big Blue Bus does sell transfers that can be used on metro. I unfortunately dont have much experience with the Culver City bus system.This summer I plan on taking BBB to the Santa Monica pier for their free concerts on Thursday nights. Lately Im enjoying Will Rogers beach in Pacific Palisades metro  drops you off right there. Hollywood and downtown are really easy to get to on metro in my opinion.

The CA science center has exhibits set up to easily teach kids about science but without sacrificing the experience for adults. They also have the Endeavor shuttle and a beautiful garden outside. So much fun.Griffith Observatory is cool as well. Its a long bus ride but you get to see space stuff.Where to meet people? Study groups clubs etc. If you want a study group people on your floor might be in your classes. Go to office hours and meet study buddies that way.Clubs are fun. My friends love photography club Swing Dancing club and the engineers love their build projects one of my friends does Taiko Japanese drumming and there is Chinese club  Japanese club etc. All the engineering majors have clubs IEEE ASME AIAA and they sponsor build projects. Rockets robots robots that fight other robots dune buggies airplanes nuclear reactors jk.There is an LGBT center lots of volunteer organizations and dorm floors try to organize social gatherings.

Plus those south campus classes where X number of students actually finish you guys have your work cut out for you. I have to say I entered UCLA expecting a challenge and the English classes Ive taken so far have been very very manageable. Thats why I thought a crosslisted philosophy class would be fine I guess lol. South campus is a whole other universe in that regard so props to anyone in the harder departments.I guess its a perspective thing and a YMMV thing you get what you give from UCLA but that goes both ways and if a class isnt working just gotta cut it loose. Were accountable to ourselves as students but if taking a class drives you to insane stress then the point is lost a little. And getting to take a much more enjoyable class later sounds like made it all worth it. Plus each department varies so greatly from class to classprof to prof. So its hard to know what youre getting into even.I do feel a little lazy considering my two class schedule now... but have rationalized that by promising myself I will work extra hard at work and try to get ahead that way...

3482836,0,t3_2zz9rx,Hi Im a current sophomore chemical engineering major and I passed out of A and B which are the two single variable calculus courses and even without an extensive knowledge in that you can do well in the multivariable courses. From my experiences with the upper division courses Im taking the most important math classes you can take are the multivariable series and differential equations so I would definitely take both of these at UCLA. In terms of math B the second half of single variable calculus if you are confident with Taylor Series I would skip that otherwise that is one of the most important concepts in math that you will use in high level engineering. Also when you do come to UCLA if you ever need help with classes or anything with school I would reccomend joining the American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE at UCLA it has a lot of great resources for freshmen.,ucla,cpp9on8,2,t5_2qscu

The perception of the school as a whole matters just as much and both schools are likely to be on par UCLA may actually have a slight edge there.  When looking at graduate programs particularly doctoral programs I would give the departments rating more weight in my search as a higherranked program is likely to offer better opportunities for research.tldr For an undergrad choosing between these two schools follow your heart.

3656957,0,t3_328ttn,Im in both programs. Honors collegium has interesting seminars for you to take. This program requires you to take additional units to fulfill their requirements. The majority of those units could overlap with your major or be knocked out by taking a cluster. I dont find this program especially useful aside from having its own counselor easier to make academic counseling appointments and ease or requesting extra units. I dont feel like Ive benefited networking wise from college honors. Deparment honors requires you to take the upper division research units for the entire year along with a seminar usually this is done during senior year. Your research will need to be supervised by faculty. These units account for some of the honors collegium units you would need. At the end of the program you have to write a thesis. Department honors is a little more difficult to get into and complete because you have to find a faculty supervisor who will sponsor your research. ,ucla,cq94abx,3,t5_2qscu

Being a public school UCLAs art department is very selective as its both a small department and possibly impacted by budget since arts is usually the first to go in schools but the second part Im not sure about because I dont know much about UCLAs impacted majors. The art admit rate for transfers in  was  compared to the university wide  though I think their admit figures went up this year for my major Design | Media Arts anyway judging from what they told us in orientation so maybe they have a slightly flexible amount of seats depending on caliber of applicants every year. I dont know if the art majors application is any more strenuous than DesMAs though in terms of hometests. You can always check this years application promptsportfolio requirements online and check out the student work as well.To major in the arts you must declare your firstprimary major in the department. If you want a secondary major outside of the department thats fine but it doesnt work the other way around apparently.

That being said get what you are most comfortable with and something that will last.  I would caution you to stay away from cheaper laptops sub  because those generally wont hold up.  Macs are good investments and will probably last you your  years but be warned almost ALL computer batteries start losing their juice sooner or later.  I have a  Mac and it holds significantly less charge than it used to.If you are open to PCs I have always had good luck with Dells ASUS and Lenovos.

I had P last year and I ended every quarter with like  swipes left over. Very few people swipe more than twice a day. Depending on your schedule you may have classes around lunch time and the walk to the dining halls and back just isnt worth it. Youll end up buying lunch at one of the places in Ackerman a lot of the time because they dont accept swipes.

7202990,0,t3_4e41v2,I also got off the wait list last year and initially SIRed to UCSB. When I first found out I was relatively apathetic because I was already set on the CCS program at UCSB. After weighing my options and visiting the campus I ultimately decided on UCLA though. I only wrote about two sentences for my supplemental so I think I got off the wait list because my grades senior year were really good. So I would recommend writing a longer supplemental with reasons why you believe ucla is the right fit for you and why you are the right fit for UCLA. I know first semester grades are already finalized but you should work hard second semester and update them with your current grade spread. Good luck man I hope you get off the wait list. I didnt get off last year until May th so I was probably one of the last. Also if you do end up going to UCSB you should really check out and apply to the CCS physics program assuming you havent heard of it. Its a world class program that would offer you a more personal education than UCLA could. ,ucla,d1wx7yh,2,t5_2qscu

7462236,0,t1_d2qd0y6,To elaborate on my original post and what uphlin is alluding toMedical schools generally require one year of biology with lab one year of chemistry with lab and one year of physics with lab at the bare minimum. Common additional requirements are one year of English one year of math one class of biochemistry andor one class of anatomy.Any of the traditional premed majors will require more classes beyond these requirements. For freshmen it doesnt matter if they major in these fields or not while they contemplate following through with applying to medical school because these requirements overlap between satisfying the majors requirements for graduation and for medical school admissions.However your case is different. Because you have already made some headway in completing most of your lower division classes and perhaps some upper division ones you would not benefit much from switching to a traditional premed major. You would have to end up taking a whole other set of upper division classes and many of your lower division classes wont satisfy your new majors requirements with the exception of psychobio. Some of these premed classes can significantly decrease your GPA which is something every premed actively avoids.In any case you might as well finish your major and take the bare minimum premed classes to satisfy medical school admission requirements. You avoid taking the difficult upper division classes for premed majors.As for picking up a minor do it if it makes you happy. Medical schools dont really care about that kind of stuff specifically. If the minor you pick up has some interesting classes then that adds to your knowledge base and perhaps an interesting talking point at interviews.,ucla,d2qerus,3,t5_2qscu

It can scan copy and fax. It only uses two ink cartridges a color one and a black one. You can find a similar one on Amazon for  something dollars. We never found a need for color ink so we only bought black ink. Canon brand ink typically would cost us  to  dollars per cartridge but we stopped buying Canon brand ink about two years ago. Now we buy generic ink cartridges from eBay where we can find them for  cartridges for . I did not take the printer with me to UCLA I left it at home for my siblings to use and its still functioning to this day. I would say if you will be living in the dorms a printer is not necessary. There are two computer labs on in the dorm area and you can also print on the many locations on campus. I lived on the dorms so I did most of my printing in the computer labs. Their hours are  am  midnight Monday through Thursday  am to  pm Friday closed on Saturday and  pm  midnight on Sunday.

I could tell you mine but that takes the fun out of it. one of the reasons I loved going to UCLA was because its so easy to get off campus. for me getting off campus would depend on the orgs I was in but I have gone clubbing or to bars taken weekend trips to San Diego had photoshoots at the Getty karaokeing or food on Sawtelle etc etc. especially if youre not from LA use free weekends to go explore! just general advice take care of yourself. make sure you take time for your own wellbeing and putting your health and mental health first especially if youre active in a lot of clubs and organizations on top of your academics. if you need it there are always counselors at CAPS. people dont talk about how stressful college can be and trust me everyone is stressed at times. it will take time to learn about how you handle stress but youll be okay and its part of the college experience. you dont need to have your life figured out but you still need to try to have at least some type of plan. Ive seen people who graduate having no idea what they want to do and people who have too many breakdowns trying to follow their life plan. I fell somewhere in the middle maybe a little closer to the latter and Im pretty happy with how I turned out. ambition will do wonders for you but dont break your back trying to follow your dreams.,ucla,d7akxen,12,t5_2qscu

Obviously the reporters had a hard time with it. Very sobering to see the remnants of the memorial flowers there for a month or so afterward that were stuck in corners and crevices near the stairs and sidewalkThis whole situation just makes me so sad.

The KoolAid Man wasnt going to bust through the wall of Klugs office give an Oh yeah! and shoot him up.There was no reason for Klug to believe that the assailant was there for anything malicious. Youre going to have trouble convincing someone that youd be prepared to draw a gun when meeting with someone you have had a long and amicable relationship with. Unless Klug draws a loaded gun on everyone that walks into his office he wasnt going to be prepared to shoot at someone who already had a gun on him and was mentally prepared to do it.That is just delusional that you believe that type of scenario.

10105391,0,t3_5kf70m,Im assuming youre looking into the PRIME program?  I cant tell exactly from that linkpdf but I think all of the MDMPH people fall under the PRIME program here at DGSOM.  The people in PRIME  here are all super nice and super great people or at least all of the ones that Ive had the pleasure of meeting and they all come from pretty diverse backgrounds such as yourself.  As for how rigorous the MPH part is I have no clue.  Im not in the program myself and I havent really met anyone yet whos gotten to the MPH part of the degree program since that usually happens at the endafter all of the medical school stuff is gotten out of the way.  And by the time my PRIME classmate counterparts get there Ill have hopefully have already graduated by then.  That being said the first couple of years of the program are normal medical school.  Can you work during medical school?  Yeah I know some of my classmates have small parttime jobs like tutoring or premed advising things like that but being in medical school kind of disallows from having much heavier jobs than that.  As other people in this thread have already said medical school itself is pretty rigorous.  Theres lots of room to balance worklifepersonal stuffhappiness in general but its not always super easy sometimes.  That all being said good luck in your journey and I hope you can get where you want to go.  ,ucla,dboqssf,1,t5_2qscu

Even if people go into a class for an easy A they still learn something in these classes.The article argues these subjects are useless and if they think these subjects are useless then they should explain why each of these classes with higher grade distributions are less valuable.

10661725,0,t1_ddf2w8i,Thats the thing though a lot of people me included find GEs to be GPA downers. So either we arent finding the right GEs are bad at writing or GEs in general dont like GEs or all of the above. Im glad to see im not the only one out there who hates GEs and doesnt understand the whole sentiment that they are easy. They are often way more work or feel like more work than some STEM classes like Chem A or the  series. But that also could be due to not enjoying them. I have always been extremely bad at writing papers so that is why they are so hard for me. Even engineering ethics felt like a ton of work as I literally finished the essays at snails pace.

11416083,0,t3_62y94c,The short answer is yes its kind of possible but also very challenging.  Theres a lot of legalese about residency i.e. whether youre a California resident for the purposes of voting or a California resident for tuition.  This page gives a quick rundown of info about being a California resident for tuition I say quick in quotes because this quick rundown is still pretty lengthy.  Basically you need to have been a resident of California for  consecutive days have an intention of staying here and most importantly prove youre financially independent of your parents.  That last point is because the UC system doesnt want to throw low tuition to people who arent true California residents and are just trying to game the system to not have to pay as much.  Youd either need to get a job that pays enough for you to completely sustain yourself or perhaps hope you get a trust fund though there are probably exemptions and ways of gaming these rules.  ,ucla,dfq02ek,1,t5_2qscu

Keep in mind the structure of the classes will be different because of this though.Most students take  classes per quarter depending on your major. The quarter system gets pretty rough especially around exam season. In my opinion quarter vs. semester system is low on what should influence your college decision though. Any proscons for either system are easily overshadowed by the colleges academics overall. It shouldnt make or break your decision.,ucla,dfsrrfs,5,t5_2qscu
