5151356,0,t3_3liyt6,This is a great clan.  I have been in about  clans over the last couple years and this is the best by far.  People are willing to help and donate.   of the time people will donate what is asked for.  but their are the occasional times where someone is donating the wrong things.  That is never ok especially during war.  I understand that you can accidentally hit the wrong button and send the wrong troop.  Just MAN UP and say hey im sorry I gave the wrong thing.  It should be an automatic exit from the clan when this happens.  Stealing a claim I feel is wrong as well.  I dont know why her attacks keep getting stolen but they are and that is unacceptable as well.  I agree that I Feel claims should have a shorter time frame maybe like  hours instead of .  All in All this clan has great teamwork and help from each other.  I am on a lot just not on for long periods except for a night.  I have the ability to get on at work but for short periods.  I can also help with suggestions.  I just wish my phone would let me go on reddit to help answer claim questions.  I am happy you guys accepted me to this clan and I now know when I left my last clan which was a good one too that I made the right decision.  Drune out,CoCtheBrotherhood,cv6xjew,1,t5_31kpq
