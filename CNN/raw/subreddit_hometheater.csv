A proper projector setup is actually generally more expensive than a TV. Here is why. With a projector you have the projection unit the screen some sort of mount and if youre going D youre looking at active glasses. Things to consider with this. Screen makes a world of difference a great screen will make your viewing experience good a bad screen will make your viewing experience horrible. You could just paint a wall white and if it works for you well it works for you. But if you want clarity and a good picture then you need a half decent screen. It will cost you a few hundos.The projector itself you want something bright with good performance as a cheap projector can impact the viewing experience.

898637,0,t3_24eq39,THD is pretty much just an indicator of quality rather than actual sound quality. Most people cant tell the difference between the measures. Its a correlation not causation case most of the time. The reason why the lower THD speaker might sound better is because it most likely has better crossover components better drivers etc. But not naturally because it has a lower THD.You want more power than less. Given everything else equal it would be better to run your speakers on a  watt amp than a  watt amp. The simple answer is headroom. Your speakers dont get ruined from raw power like they get ruined from clipping. Clipping is distortion induced when an amp essentially runs out of power but is trying to produce more. You can literally never have too much power. Then its just up to you to not turn up the knob as high. Think of it like a high performance engine vs. economy engine. The high performance engine will still drive mph and go to the grocery store just like the economy one. But the economy one will start to kill itself if its needed to race. I run Klipsch Reference series speakers which are very sensitive on a  watt per channel amplifier.  wpc is more than enough to crank those up but Ive never ran into issues.

1571801,0,t3_2c7apu,The key thing to remember for impedance when matching speakers with amps and receivers is how stable the amp will be at lower impedance.  Most amps in receivers are not the highest quality and can struggle driving low impedance high power speakers at high volumes.That being said stress on the amp will occur at high volumes. That Pioneer receiver has plenty of power to drive those smaller Micca speakers.

1673826,0,t1_cjq44yr,gt However the other piece of this puzzle is how youre going to get the signal into the Adcom. If your receiver has two subwoofer outputs great. One to the sub one to the shakers.  My subs are currently receiving high level input from my LR speakers. They use plate connectors between the sub and speaker input posts so my receiver has  vacant preamp subwoofer RCA outputs. I figured I would use both when I got  shakers and then add splitters as I add  more. I previously had each of my subs hooked up to these line levels and didnt like the delay in the subs turning on at lower volumes.  My polk audio floorstanding RTps are rated as low as hz for both the sub and speaker. Would keeping those set as large on my receiver for full range signal and setting everything else to small to eliminate the tapering off of the bass on the nonwoofer speakers i.e. presence and surround speakers work? Or what about leaving the cross over at hz and lowering the gain until satisfactory?  Ultimately from the sound of your assistance nothing should blow up. I have been looking at those plate amps as well like the Dayton Audio w but if money doesnt need to be spent then Ill take a shot at not spending it you know?,hometheater,cjq5bw9,1,t5_2rof6

Your eyes are not accurate enough to be able to say that your tv is perfect.  Nor are your sources good enough.  In fact most bluray player game consoles cable boxes and any other source device you can think of have their own set of picture controls on board which affects the end image produced on your tv.  The only way to get a truly accurate image on any tv is to have it properly calibrated.

1769836,0,t1_ck25ttd,If you can get the HD box I would get it as that would be the ticket to getting a nice HD picture.  The good thing about the settop box STB is you can send the audio to the AVR from that usually. Your AVR is probably first gen surround sound...no HDMI no opticaldigital inputs.  Youre pretty much stuck with the stereo analogue inputs.  To connect the TV without using the STB youll need an digital to analogue converter  Thats assuming that the STB has stereo outputs on it.  Youll still probably want the converter if youre running anything through the new TV.   Now recommendations for the gear... whats your budget?  Its hard to give you ideas without knowing that.  It sounds like you want to go with a . setup...which after looking at your AVR you could do.  However you normally want to match all three front speakers to get a proper timbre match.  Im pretty sure you wont be able to find a matching center so really anything at this point would work.  You could also replace all three up front in order to start building a nice HT.  Another option for you is to replace the whole audio setup.  New AVR new speakers and new cables HDMI.  You could either piece this together or go for a prepack set  That is an example of one.    ,hometheater,ck28ryl,2,t5_2rof6

1821153,0,t3_2ff0ga,Are the speakers getting loud enough for you? In that case theyre perfectly fine. More amplifier power doesnt  better sound. If you feel like the speakers arent getting loud enough or just feel like you need more power youd need an amplifier. Since your receiver doesnt have preouts for the front and side and center speaker you know how two options Either get a separates system a preamplifer and an amplifier or get a better more powerful receiver. Many here will tell you a seperates system works great and will save money in the long run since you never need to upgrade an amplifier. However for the most part separates gear is made for the highend AV user. The best brands Id look towards for these are Emotiva and Outlaw Audio.

I could have ordered everything online but it was much cheaper to go to Frys and piece together the system.   First the speakers I went to  different Fry stores to get the towers sub bookshelf and center speaker.  Since the system is discontinued I got everything at less than half off.  The whole system cost me about  including ft of speaker wire and a ft subwoofer cable.       I was going to buy the Denon SBT after reading great reviews online but once I got to Best Buy I noticed the speaker hookups were cheap clips.  I decided to go the step up and get the Denon SW  I paid I think  for the receiver and I couldnt be happier.  If I want to upgrade to . or k in the future I now have that option and the ipadiphone control is pretty sweet.    Im similar to you I researched for probably  months before settling on the pioneer system with a denon receiver.  Extremely happy with my purchases and I hope this helps!        Edit I saw the top comment posted the same speakers and I saw your comment about the towers.  The towers have  wall anchor clips in the back I know this because my wife panicked after the last earthquake so now everything is tied down.  ,hometheater,clglfwo,3,t5_2rof6

3491356,0,t3_30931b,I would recommend you look into investing in an outdoor TV. I work for SkyVue Outdoor TVs. We build them to last through rain dust snow and extreme temperatures. There are several companies out there including ours that offer similar models. I suggest doing some research based on your specific needs. I will give you some pointers with a nonbiased approach.Things you need to consider  Will the TV be in direct sun? or under a covered porchpatio? Outdoor TVs have brighter panels than indoor TVs which allow you to see the screen even in sunny situations.  nits  Do you already have speakers set up? If not  some brands offer internal speakers just like indoor TVs but they are very limited and dont typically push sound the direction needed. Other companies offer speaker bars with their televisions that are louder than indoor speaker bars more wattage  also weatherproof. Where are you planning on mounting your TV? This will help you decide which size you should get. There are hangers mounts and carts available all over the web.  Outdoor TVs usually have fan cooling systems that are made to keep your TV cool when its really hot outside and heating elements to keep your TV warm when temperatures get cold. Indoor TVs can easily be damaged by extreme temperatures like these. Id be happy to answer any more questions. ,hometheater,cpq8mw1,8,t5_2rof6

3971239,0,t1_cr8u6tv,My thoughts exactly.  I used to have full separates from Emotiva  x UPA UPA and a UMC.  It cost me  just for the amps.  I then switched to the UPAs just for my FL and FR then leave the center and surround to the receiver Denon AVR.  When listening to music I get all the punch I need out of the fronts but in surround duty the receiver handles everything just fine.  If I wasnt interested in the features of a higher end AVR I could get equal sound quality out of a  unit.  Total price would be about  for the amps and receiver instead of  for complete separates.The problem is that even midlevel receivers are ditching preouts for the L and R channels.  For instance the new Onkyo TXNR lacks them.  It blows my mind that a company will skimp on the  to solder in a new connection that could future proof the receiver a bit better.  ,hometheater,cr8ydb9,3,t5_2rof6

I have  year old Def tech dr towers that I prefer because they have clearer highs and offer punchier bass.  In my opinion the Pioneers shine in the middle and when paired with the matching center are GREAT for surround sound.   For stereo listening I feel like they do best at high volumes.

4116996,0,t1_crpj79z,Depending on your Router you would type  for older Linksys Routers or ... for some Belkin routers and some netgear use either ... or .... This should give you your DNS addresses your router uses. if Subnet mask and Default gateway are not listed in your router information open a command prompt by hitting your windows start button and typing cmd into into the search box on your start menu On Windows  or older. Windows  or Apple I have no clue on. Once the command prompt is up type ipconfig and hit enter. This will list your subnet mask and default gateway addresses. You set these in the TV by going to the Network menu on the TV then Manual Setup and switching DHCP to off. After switching it to off you should be able to adjust all the addresses to match the router addresses.  Again this is how I fixed the apps on my Vizio TV. After seeing that you mention you have  devices it could be an IP conflict too. If this is the case it should be safe to set your TV as a static IP on your router and then change the IP address in the TV to match. This will make sure the router only assigns that particular IP address to your TV. If you need directions on setting a static IP address find out what router you have and search on Youtube for a tutorial for setting it all up.,hometheater,crpkaql,1,t5_2rof6

4546828,0,t1_ct3nfnd,The stuff youre googling is out of date. Its  you can ditch the soundblaster the optical cable Spidf and the headphone jacks and just output . audio from your GTX  to your receiver. Ive been doing this with nvidia cards for a while and that all has always just worked out of the box. All you need is hdmi out for your videoaudio to your receiver unless you have a gsync monitor and for multiplayer games you need a USB from your PC to your headphones. Old headphones have . inch plugs and USB modern ones have only USB thats probably what you need. Since you mention that a typical AV receiver is too huge an alternative for you might be just HDMI out for the monitor and then a USB . headset which are available from a variety of manufacturers. Youd have HDMI out for video and USB for surround audio real simple. I dont have any experience with these and the idea of surround headphones makes me cringe but apparently some people really dig them and it might be a cheaper upgrade with better sound if you dont have the room for a proper . av receiver. The nice thing is you can get a set and try it and if it doesnt work then return the headset then consider going balls to the wall with a proper receiver.Hope this helps! ,hometheater,ct3r4et,1,t5_2rof6

4937808,0,t1_cufws0z,gt what kind of improvements would I expect to see with a better receiver andor some sort of dedicated amp? I assume its not just an improvement on volume because I certainly dont need that I normally have the receiver set to about db. Clarity? Dynamic range?Hey. Ill answer things to the best of my knowledge. At those low volume levels assuming the system is calibrated where dB means dB from movie reference level of dB average with dB peaks youre probably barely taxing the receiver even though the p are low impedance in the mid and upper bass. I would expect no improvements at all Assuming the amplifier provides flat response output and that is a safe assumption only ultraultracheap crap usually deviates badly here even more budget AVRs are fine. Im guessing you havent heard any harshness due to amp clipping nor is the AVR ever really hot assuming its properly ventilated nor did it shut down protection circuits. Especially because...gt Also I have them paired with an in sub.Bass low frequencies in general consumes the most power  the lower the more power. So the sub helps alleviate the AVR.gt I assume the crossover frequency I should be using is Hz?Its a good point to start with. It depends how it sounds in your room. Above that the sub location may begin to be noticeable and distraction. I wouldnt go much lower say Hz since even an in sub should be more capable than ps below Hz. Anyway by far the most important part is positioning the sub in the best location  look up the sub crawl. Some rules no more than .ft away from the back wall boundary or floor for that matter due to boundary cancellation if crossed over at Hz.gt And for the MCACC setup should I indicate they are small or large speakers I cant seem to get a straight answer to that question.Definitely small. Small is telling the AVR use the sub crossover. Large is saying dont use the sub for these speakers.gt Also my sub has a dial on the back that seems to indicate crossover frequency. Do I turn that to match the crossover setting I use on the receiver?Turn it up to max the receiver will handle the crossover.gt Sorry for all these unsolicited questions!Its no bother at all my pleasure to help. The best improvements you can make to your system will be by working hard toward the best sub positioning a bigger sub and two subs positioned on opposite sides of the room is a good starting point to combat cancellations in the bass due to room interactions.I would only change the AVR to get Audyssey or if youre rich Dirac Live MCACC doesnt seem to do much good from the measurements Ive seen. ,hometheater,cugy7w2,1,t5_2rof6

There is a possibility they could need more power than the amp can handle or they could be an impedance that the amp cant handle even though i kinda doubt that as i have run  ohm speakers for a long time and pretty loud on a denon amp rated for  ohms.

6448852,0,t3_43viz0,For me it wasnt too hard a decision to get a p LG eg last year.  Im a big enthusiast of physical media owning about  Bluray releases currently.  I hope UHD Blurays are a success and not another d format but Ill be waiting it out.  Heres how I came to my decision Bleeding edge pricing and scarce content availability doesnt appeal to me.  I have no problem waiting  years before considering hardware to watch UHD releases.  That would mean for me purchasing a  k TV a compatible receiver and a player.  There needs to be a lot of content available and at good prices for me to overhaul my setup like that.  Last position I want to be in is invested in UHD too early to the point Im buying releases I wouldnt otherwise just because its all there is.  With that is also the concern that it could be the next niche d format that nobody buys or cares about where major studios like Disney dont even bother to do d for a new release in all markets. I have eclectic taste and do a lot of watching and purchasing of boutique label releases from Criterion Arrow Masters of Cinema BFI and so on.  My gut says that many of those I own already have the definitive disc release on k Bluray.  Ill be much more interested in UHD ifwhen those labels start releasing but until then Im fine staying on the sidelines.  Time will tell how aggressive the major studios are in releasing and pricing which I also prefer to apply the wait and see approach to. k Blurays on a p OLED give me the best PQ out of anything else I looked at in stores and I get that on all the discs I own and countless ones I dont.  Pricing of the TV was great too being roughly at midtier k LCD sets.  Audio quality on streaming isnt great.  UHD streaming will probably gain good momentum over the next  years but I have a hard time caring when they still wont give me a lossless audio option or much higher bitrate p streams.  Im talking about mainstream providers like Netflix Vudu and Amazon here.  Ive heard of some premium options where you download  GBs of data to specific hardware before watching but that is likely forever out of my price range.  So all said Blurays are cheap readily available and have lossless audio so theyre the way to go considering my setup.  ,hometheater,czmco10,2,t5_2rof6

If you plug in the speakers through the standard redblack connectors like youve shown on the wall panels then run cable from speaker to the wall socket and then plug your old speaker cables into the appropriate socket at the receiver end.

Its just not as important to them they text dont talk they stream dont collect. It is to me because I like the lossless audio and high bit rate video plus at my age Ive been conditioned to replace my catalog whenever a new  better format comes out. VHS to DVD I get it. DVD to Blu ray took me awhile to get on board but  I got it. Blu Ray to UHD I dont know? Thats all Im saying. I have a wall full of Blu Rays. What am I supposed to do? Pawn them for  bucks apiece and start over with UHD at  to  a pop?  I also get that the hardware players will come way down as time goes by but I have my doubts about the discs. I think they will    start and stay relatively high for a long time. Why shouldnt they? Fewer people buy discs of any kind much anymore and UHD to me is a new audiophile format ala laser disc IMHOand I own laser discs that they know the enthusiasts will pay more for so why not charge them?

6730931,0,t1_d0fhddi,Audyssey XT first best room correction software of the major receiver players . XT has extra filters over just the XT that levels the frequency response for the subwoofer so much so that a major subwoofer company that offers a built in Parametric EQ on their subs says that if you room correct with a Denon with Audyssey XT then you dont even need to use our subs  EQ. nd feature is Atmos X location based height channel software  rd is the coming firmware upgrade to DTSX location based height channel softwarecoming for the XW for sure but I believe your models getting it also just dont quote me on that. along with this is DTSs upmixer for non DTSX content called Neural X which is getting rave reviews for its ability to make you think the content is mixed like a location based height channel software when it isnt. All of the Dynamic modes available in the built in DSP dynamic volume dynamic bass for listening late at night and for lessening subwoofer frequencies that get your door knocked on by the police. Great DAC good power supply low total harmonic distortion for the amp  amp pre outs for channel expansion and a great albeit not fancy initial setup menu which basically no brainers the speaker setup. Oops forgot the included cardboard cutout for the Audyssey setup mike to use as a stand at your primary listening position with  or more different available calibration position presets to finely tune the receivers Audyssey speaker settings crossovers level and distance.

Bring your favorite tracks no need for HD music iTunes is fine trust me on this relax and prepare to be knocked off your feet!For the record my test drive of RoomPerfect was at a friends house he sells them out off his home using the TDAI ampprocessor xw  Ohm driving a pair of Waterfall Audio Victoria speakers with Atohm drivers and a pair of Waterfall Audio HF subs the TDAI has two discrete sub channels. Then I listened to some Michael Jackson some Pink Floyd and some jazz. I knew all of the tracks before but it was like I was hearing them for the first time. Nothing short of amazing.Important if your dealer sells the top of the line SteinwayLyngdorf systems you might be offered the option to listen to that instead and get to test drive a   audio system. This is perfectly fine and also quite amazing but Id really advise you to stay real and test drive a system that would actually have its place in your house rather than in a billionaires crib.

Slight variations in DC resistance are imperceptible were talking a tenth or two of a dB and only really impact low bass frequencies. An  ohm speaker is only impacted half as much as a  ohm. And were not dealing with radio frequencies so slight impedance mismatches arent going to be causing transmission line reflections and voltages are high enough that even if they DID occur theyd be swamped by the actual signal. So mostly worry about everything else first.

For your surrounds IMO the Qs work better than Qs unless you have a massive room as I like their midrange better..  I was not impressed with the QSeries sub.  I would suggest the commonly recommended SVS or HSU subs in the same price range..  Towers vs Bookshelf for fronts.  You have to listen for yourself.  QQs are more efficient and I prefer their midlow range as they approach crossover.  Is it worth the extra money  maybe not to your ears..  Sound is subjective  even if you have to travel a few hours I would suggest listening before you buy.  Someone mentioned you could do better for you money however I dont think there is a better deal then buying KEF in October when they have their sales. KEF direct has xQ for  xQ for  Qs are  each if you go big.

9449984,0,t1_d9duf7u,It depends on which DAC is better.  One depends on software decoding in your Apple TV and one depends on decoding happening with your receiver.  My bet is that the receiver has a better DAC than the apple TV but I also bet that it makes little to no sound difference at all.  Back in the day my sony receiver would light up a blue LED if it was decoding a DD or DTS signal.  In my current system I have my PS set to LCPM because it has a really good DAC.,hometheater,d9duok6,1,t5_2rof6
9474905,0,t3_5affvr,Short answer the Micca is better than nothing but its best to save your money and get the KEF center later if you can afford it.Ive never heard the Micca its not even sold in my country but reviews and measurements dont inspire confidence. And even if it was comparable quality to the KEFs it would still have a different sound signature. The center channel is very important phantom center is not a good enough substitute. So other things being equal a nonmatching somewhat inferior speaker is better than nothing. But other things arent equal you dont have the extra speaker lying around you gotta spend .Id save up to get the KEF center later like even  year later.

The only downfall is no perfect listening position but this looks more like HT and not necessarily music listening.  But there is a bonus to everything being off angle and reflections probably easier to deal with.  Option  would be much easier to set up if you pull in the couch and put a bar area behind it it REALLY depends on the size of the screen you want because i think that far wall couch in option  would be too far away to be ideal anyway. Lets be real.. youre the one sitting in the direct on seat you dont want to artificially make your awesome screen smaller.In option  the bar area is accessible without interrupting anyone watching nearly everyone can get up and get a drink without interrupting anyone else. This is a big thing especially if youre planning on entertaining other people frequentlyhave kids etc.  While I generally hate stuff like TVs in corners you can hide a receiveramp stack back there in that corner and elevate your TV enough to have a center right below it.  The only real other issue I see with this is there is no mention where your subwoofer would go..I personally like the idea of doing option  though because its very open and nice use of space.  I really like the fact that you could have ideal listening positions here subwoofer placement would be easy tower placement is easy there is no issue of a towerbookshelf being out in the open off the corner where your entrance is... Yeah you have no bar.. but have you considered a dry bar where you have the no bar  text?  You could do a small bar w a mini fridge there for drinks and snacks.  A full bar with seating is pretty cool in theory but ask yourself how frequently it would be used in conjunction with folks using the tvmedia area.. You could do a pretty fair amount of seating with a big L shaped connected sofa on both sides.  I feel like in option  your main sofa is pretty far out away from where the TV would be.. You could modify that plan to have the sofa come forward some and put in a custom floating countertop w barstools that swivel folks can chill  feet behind the main seating which would put your main sofa on the bottom of the  rd image  right at a good distance for a  tv or up to a  screen.,hometheater,dblv8sd,2,t5_2rof6

10133646,0,t3_5l1gzo,The trouble with inceiling speakers is that the goodlooking ones tend to be expensive as the tolerances are smaller the materials are better quality and the looks are designed by a company with better designers. What you typically get for a higher price is notably a thinner bezel i.e. the speaker sticks out of the ceiling less a more discreet grille both important factors if WAF is your concern.Were professional AV installers plus we operate in Europe so I cant give you useful pointers based on price but suffice to say we use a lot of different brands of speakers and the thinnest and most discreet inceiling speakers that I know of short of using truly invisible speakers such as those from Stealth Acoustics are those made by KEF. Sonance is a close second and has the huge advantage of making all of their Visual Performance series available in round square or rectangular variants for the same price so you can choose the format that best fits your design.Lastly depending on what position your speakers will hold in a multichannel audio setup and where theyll be installed relative to the listening position you might need to pick models with a moveable tweeter so keep that in mind too as it also impacts price.Not all inceiling speakers are made equal and choosing toocheap models will come back and bite you in the proverbial ass. Choose wisely and youll get the sound youre looking for.,hometheater,dbsf3n4,2,t5_2rof6

I understand the convenience soundbars provide but chances are the clientele this TV is aiming for already has a pretty nice sound solution. It also takes away from this so called aesthetic LG is going for. Lets put this insanely flat TV on the wall but then need a massive soundbar thing that needs to be directly below the TV.

10204946,0,t1_dc0rfdc,Its bullshit to say you cant quantify the resolution of analog film.  It has a grain it has a maximum detail level.  It just is not uniformly spaced like a digital imaging sensor.  The manufactures even specify it  here is a datasheet from Kodak.  The Modulation Transfer Function MTF describes the resolution.  Typically one would say there is no more resolution when the MTF reaches . or ..  Kodak does not provide values at high enough frequencies but we can speculate that this happens at about lpmm as the slope is only going to increase.A mm frame contains then at most   .MP or .K resolution.For S we have ..  .MP resolution about .K.Note that that is perf S not the standard film which is a bit smaller ..The MTF of the taking lens film scanner and any other downstream processes multiply.  None of them are equal to  at lpmm so the films potential can never be realized if you wish to frame the scenario that way.  Handling damages the film scratches dust which reduces the resolution further.There are higher resolution films than  but this is the most popular stock.I do not mean to frame jagged edges as a pro for digital  it is a con.  You trade it for again the capacity for better contrast.  First generation digital cinema projectors have quite terrible contrast.  More modern installations are better than mm film and Imaxs laser projection system is better than mm film.I dont know what you mean by internegative.  In hollywood or NYC there is a master print of the film.  There may be multiple masters if a digital intermediate process was used.  The masters are generation .  The first children are duplicates made for long term storage and projection at premium and early showings.  Second children are reproduced off of those first projection copies.  Third children are made off of those second copies and so forth.If you duplicate the film immediately after you create it there isnt a large loss of quality.  Unfortunately this is rarely what is done.  Dont get me wrong.  I love film and Im a trained projectionist all the way up to mm.  But Im not disillusioned into thinking it is some insurpassible level of image quality.  The alexa  is very close to the quality of standard mm film as the alexa is very close to the quality of super mm.  Imax mm is still noticeably better than anything else.  I think things will stay that way until the quirks of film like reciprocity failure and a fundamentally different way of sensing color are replicated on digital.,hometheater,dc0sdle,2,t5_2rof6

10268498,0,t3_5jxqoe,I ended up buying Polk Audio Signature S  It was more cash than I wanted but the local Best Buy had one open box for .The first comment mentioned the receiver having a good room calibration.  And the Audyssey setup on my Denon was impressive after my initial setup.  So I figured it would work again when I upgraded.The second and third comment mentioned how sensitive my hearing was and listening to determine if it bothered me.  Well I have slightly above average hearing but nothing great and what I had was so mismatched and undersized the center from my old Infinity TSS  almost anything would be better.I chose the Polk S center for two reasons It fit.  I really wanted something small almost like a soundbar to fit under the TV. The other speakers in the Polk Signature Line all have . woofers.  So the center is designed for the size of speaker I already have in my ceiling.Amazing! The sound is a huge step up.  Of course it have a fuller sound especially with music and the voices are much clearer.  The biggest difference I noticed was the surround field was more distinct.  I guess because I dont have to turn up the volume as much to hear the vocals  the rear background seems larger if that makes any sense.Anyways I just wanted to stop and say thanks.  You guys were a big help when I started with the TV receiver and ceiling speakers.

The first time they shipped it back to me without fixing anything. It was at the shop for about  mo.  I decided to ship it back because I had paid for shipping and some repairs that never happened. nd time around they kept it for about mo. They needed to replace the board with the surround sound but i think it was no longer manufactured. They had to find a replacement surround chip and hand soldered it.  The SR was only  yr into a yr warranty and I could not get a replacement part for it... Thats a problem when you think about it. Overall I was about mo without my receiver. I was pretty sure they were going to scrap the unit so I bought a SR. And I received that one with a broken antenna...  When I called Marantz for the broken Bluetooth antenna they ignored me for  days. Then told me to return it to Amazon then shipped me an FM antenna out of the blue.

Stick to looking at  and To give you a quick run down of HDRHDR currently has  formats. HDR and Dolby Vision. HDR is more popular but lower quality not that much lower though still a lot better than nonHDR. Dolby Vision requires a physical chip in the TV while HDR is just software. Since HDR TVs dont have the chip they can never support Dolby Vision but Dolby Vision TVs support HDR since they just need a software update which theyve all done at this point. Dolby Vision TVs are generally the more expensive ones. The XBox One S Im pretty sure is HDR so it will work on any HDR TV. Whether a Dolby Vision blu ray will work on it Im not sure. This breaks out which TVs can do which HDR type. Also in the learn section is a pretty good article on HDR as a wholeMy personal opinion Since HDR contains less information it makes it easier to stream so cable providers and streamers like Netflix will likely pick HDR for their content I think Netflix and Amazon already are choosing it for their limited HDR selections. Its also the common denominator since every HDR TV has it so choosing that format will also reach the most people.I would start by looking at the Samsung KS Sony XD and Sony XD. The  and  are a bit over your budget but all three of these TVs will have their prices reduced once the  models come out. Id use that same website I linked to compare them. Theyre all HDR TVs. For Dolby Vision your best bets are the Vizio P and the LG B OLED as youll see theyre more expensive,hometheater,dcmu08j,5,t5_2rof6

10722501,0,t3_5t9ynt,As others have said matching for Atmos doesnt matter unless youre ridiculously fussy. If you go for a different brand of surround you may notice a difference when sounds pan around the room. Again this comes down to how fussy you are  when youre caught up in a movie very few people noticecare. Just try to get surrounds that sound tonally similar to your ears  Goldenears arent accurate speakers theyre distinctively voiced so try to get something with similar voicing.gt Am I looking for anything different when discussing rears or surrounds? IE would a speaker thats good for one be good for the other?Yesgt Im seeing people talk about bipole speakers. Whats the benefit of them specifically here?If youre going for Atmos theyre not recommended by Dolby. However if you get a chance try them to see if you like the spread of sound.Btw are you intending the system mainly to be for movies or for channel stereo? Because if its for movies theres little point in getting the Ones as mains. Unless you get extremely lucky their subs will be in the wrong place in your room.,hometheater,ddly383,1,t5_2rof6

10936116,0,t1_de7x350,Even with a  discount that comes to well over  you would need like  off.    If you can see my flair you can see I have Klipsch fronts and a sub and I like them a lot they are the Synergy series bought all on Craigslist recently for  seperately however critics I would have for that setup are    Front towers I personally believe the only benefit they have over bookshelves are aesthetics unless talking big money. The fact that they go lower is moot as a subwoofer would be better at those frequencies anyway and double bass isnt a big factor. I would get those Klipsch backsurrounds see below and use them as your fronts uzeospanteras review of them    Center Yep thats a good choice.    Side surround Did you check the price Hint its for each? Thats way too God damn much to spend on surrounds. Surrounds are for noise such as the soundtrack gun shots the occasional rear dialogue etc. Also those are bipoles so they contradict your previous statement if you want me to explain bipoledipoleradiator I can. I would suggest you stay with the Fluance models I suggested.    Back surrounds Again way too much money for your budget to spend on rears. see here They have a nonremovable base so not meant for wallmounting and again you want frontported or sealed speakers wallmounting a rearported speaker is no bueno. Id still suggest those Fluance bookshelves mainly because they are comparable to the Klipsch Rs I mentioned earlier and they are frontported Im not aware of better options for this price range above the cost of those Sound Appeals.    Sub I would not recommend that sub. I have the Klipsch Sub which has watt RMS amp watt peak and gets down to Hz. I like it and I have it half gain to match my Klipsch fronts with my wattchannel receiver at half power. That Klipsch sub you linked to is watt RMS amp watt peak and gets down to Hz. Unless you want to buy used like I did those two subs I linked to are far superior the BIC goes down to Hz with watt RMS amp watt peak and the HSU is the same specs probably slightly better sounding bass with more power distributed to the super subsonic frequency range but it has the option of closing  port which brings it to only Hz but much more power. If you are only going with one give me a few minutes and I can find you a single sub to compete with a pair of those subs but a pair is always better for your layout.,hometheater,de7zezg,1,t5_2rof6

10999003,0,t3_5wyujq,How loudly do you expect to play?WPC from the Griffin Twenty recommended by doubois will get you dB maximum output at a normal listening distance with your Paradigm Atoms. Going with the Yamaha and its WPC will buy you some headroom up to dB. dB may not sound like much but thats a huge amount of headroom before clipping in comparison.On the other hand I used a WPC Fisher CA for a long time for my bookshelf speakers and I never actually used the full WPC according to the power meters at least. Not even when I played at relatively loud levels. And those speakers are a little less efficient than your Paradigms. Your speakers are reasonably efficient especially if you relieve them of bass duty by using a sub.Plus the Griffin is probably the first stereo amp Ive seen that actually has a real proper crossover on its subwoofer output and highpasses the main speaker outputs. It gets major brownie points for that.The downside of its superclean design is that you only get Bluetooth and an optical input nothing else. The Yamaha at least gives you set of analog inputs in addition to the optical input.

11392397,0,t1_dfn3m2x,I may be biased as I own the Samsung but I think you should go with the Ks. Input lag is clearly important to you and it is lower on the Samsung. Picture uniformity is a big deal to me and that is also reportedly better on the Samsung. The local dimming is better on the Sony so if you are viewing in a dark room it is something to consider. ,hometheater,dfnb889,1,t5_2rof6

11548782,0,t1_dg51qt4,Since the receiver is only a single zone does it have B speakers with AB switching?

11663869,0,t3_666lgp,All videos even Blu Ray are compressed and streams are often compressed further depending on bandwidth.  One of the easiest ways to reduce the number of bits needed to display a single image is to save on color depth.  Streaming HDR is mostly marketing bullshit.  For most streamed encodings even with high bandwidth for almost all pixels you have contain far less than even SDRs  bits of color depth.  For most pixels color information is approximated from neighbors or previous frames.  If your network cant reliably stream p it doesnt matter if your streams can support HDR. Color loss due to compression will more than negate any gains from HDR support.Several years ago I remember most people struggling to tell the difference between a  bit panel and an  bit panel on a laptop.  The number of people who can differentiate an image with  bits of color depth and one with  bits will be much smaller.  Id wager that someone who tells me that they can do that with a highly compressed stream is just not being honest.,hometheater,dgi44rk,3,t5_2rof6
