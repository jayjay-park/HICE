9239617,0,t1_d8n2y91,Exactly. The ratings Scrubs Med got were so fucking poor. And everything you said about how they just poured the old characters in there is why. In my opinion Dr. Cox was perfect like you said. He fit no matter what show he was originally from. J.D Elliot Turk and even that weird episode with Sonny didnt fit. In my mind I saw a brand new show that Bill Lawrence had created that was loosely based around Scrubs but was mostly a show about what goes on through students eyes as they go through Med School. But for them to just write in characters that were just too fucking out of place or to just change their personalities was out right idiotic. I mean that episode where J.D. and Turk go to Dr. Mahoney and push her to go date Drew was like J.D. and Turk. But for Dr. Mahoney to listen and just go out of her way to talk to him and try to start a relationship was not her character. And from then on she went downhill... completely changing.ABC fucked this spinoff over hard. They had a fresh start and they made it as much as they could as the original. First Mistake. Then they add all the original characters back and change every way about how they act versus the original Scrubs. Second Mistake. Then they cancel it after one Season because the ratings were so hard because of the first two mistakes. Third Mistake. Oh and one more thing...Zach Braff wanted to stop playing J.D. after Season .,Scrubs,d8n6sxy,2,t5_2rs5a
