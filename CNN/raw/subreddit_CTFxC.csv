732695,0,t3_22j5bz,Initially I was very surprised about this but after reading a lot of these comments everything makes more sense now. Deep down I feel like the cancer is the underlying cause for the separation as it has made Charles a different person. He definitely is not who he was a few years back. Now this is not to say that he is a bad person now but I am just stating that it seems like his personality has changed. Also like some others have mentioned I feel like they are in two separate stages in their lives. Alli is still young wild and free while Charles seems much more mature. Im definitely not blaming one over the other and I hate to see this happen do them after all that has already happened. Its just so weird to have watched them when they were boyfriend and girlfriend and now I am watching them get separated just five years later. Its quite surreal actually. ,CTFxC,cgnk7st,18,t5_2s7gl

All we saw was a minute or two and we didnt even see her directly we heard her laughing once or twice and say very little. It brings up the point again that we dont know what goes on behind the camera.It might seem like Charles is having a tough time and Im sure he is but you need to remember that he is also unwell so that is also going to be affecting his mood people cope in different ways and thats something we also need to remember before we start accusing people and placing blame.,CTFxC,cgq552s,1,t5_2s7gl

892001,0,t3_24c3me,Im pretty indifferent to the fact that Charles may or may not be dating again. Its really his decision and we really have no say in it. Im really not sure if he is with this new girl and if he is I feel that it could be too soon. Thats only my personal opinion assuming that he and Alli truly did break up  weeks ago. But again thats just my personal thoughts. For all we really know they could have been separating before Charles posted the We Need To Talk video which would make the time after breakup more substantial. All Im really saying here is who cares. Its his life. We dont really know what happened. They say no on cheated and I believe it so I really dont feel that another girl being in the picture is a problem. And she may not even be in the picture! Girls and guys can be just friends. People just need to chill out about Charles and Allis separation. They are grown people who know whats best for them. We should be lucky to even know as much about their lives as we do. Glad youre giving Charles the benefit of the doubt because he seriously needs all the support he can get. This is a tough time for the both of them and hes continued doing what he loves during this hard time not only for himself but to please us. ,CTFxC,ch5oax4,9,t5_2s7gl
894519,0,t3_24c3me,I dont really mind if Charles is dating someone else but what I am mad at is the double standard.People calling Alli a lot of horrible names because she wasnt in the announcement vlog claiming shes cheated and all other stuff. Just for her to reveal that Charles wanted to do it on his own and I dont think she was overly happy at that mentioning it twice. Now with Charles dating people are just saying as long as hes happy etc. Whereas if Alli was involved with someone she would get a ton of hate again.Im not saying everyone is like this thankfully on this website there are more mature people that can have an actual discussion but on others I just hate this double standard Charles can do no wrong but Alli is the devil. Im not blaming anyone for this split and who knows if we ever find out why they really broke up but that just grills me.,CTFxC,ch5ylv1,32,t5_2s7gl
915718,0,t3_24ll68,My parents are divorced and when youre in denial you try to think and pick at every detail of both people and say well because they are doing this means heshe still loves them unfortunately we have grown attached to Charles and Alli and I think about  of people want to see them together but honestly I dont think the necklace means anything about them getting back together if you pick at every little thing they do and get your hopes up you will be disappointed when nothing happens. I think there still is a very small chance of them rekindling their marriage again but then again we have no idea what happened and why they even separated. ,CTFxC,ch8dg52,1,t5_2s7gl
932307,0,t1_cha4kvs,Charles has to get the insurance on them considering how much he breaks them. He probably spends like  a year to get it replaced for free every time he needs a new one. He doesnt buy it outright every time that would be a waste of money. ,CTFxC,cha9apa,3,t5_2s7gl

It is completely up to Charles to do exactly whatever he want  which he does and i think a lot of it comes from him and his brain cancer  he does not want to wait around for happiness he simply just takes any chance he gets.The thing that i and probably a lot of other people can feel is weird is when did he meet this new Ally? We have all been following him for the last couple of years and as far as i know  she has never been sighted in the vlogs before.

1634896,0,t3_2cyhil,I think you pose an interesting question.  The first Ally and Alli those were just coincidences.  But Allie?  Something is up there. Heres my theory.Charlie first met Allie through Facebook. This narrows down our possibilities Charles noticed Allie apart from all his other followers simply because her name was Allie.  He may have accidentally opened up her Facebook page when seeing Allie assuming it was Alli and then liking her photos and progressing their relationship.  Allie is a significant name for Charles and it will stick out whenever in writing.  Ever have an ex and see their name on paper?  Yeah like that. Charles has a great philia in names and gets turned on by the name allyAlliealli.  Can only date allys for this reason.My reasoning for him dating Allie is option .  Its not coincidence that her name is Allie.,CTFxC,cjl8sbd,2,t5_2s7gl
1665673,1,t1_cjp45yc,He hasnt talked shit about her in videos but it was through instagram comments where a lot of socalled fans blasted him and other fans in the comments of one of his photos and talked about how he should be happy with Allie because Alli Speed was a blubbering drunkard and he finally lost that last nerve and said there you go in agreement.It wasnt him shit talking it was him giving up on fighting those that hate him so much for filing for divorce.

Doesnt mean its right but it shouldnt define a person.And if people dont want them back together then why still bring shit up? To waste precious time on the internet while you could be well I dont know minding and concentrating on your own life? If you cant change the situation why bring it up? Its a dead issue. Move on or ship out. Hmmm maybe if fans werent so shitty and leaving idiotic comments on either of their videos and started being kind and supportive to BOTH of them Like they should have in the first place then maybe none of those would have happened the way they did and both could live separate and in peace? Also could just wanna support her by watching them? Why should someone have to explain why they watch a video? Do you need an answer for everything? Oh I forgot vlog watchers are entitled to EVERYTHING. Geez. My bad.,CTFxC,cm004fy,-3,t5_2s7gl
2575820,0,t3_2pab94,Allie is IMO a guest on the CTFxC channel like the guys in We The Kings. She has no real involvement into the vlogs like Alli did. She edited produced and did a lot more for the channels success than shes given credit for. ,CTFxC,cmusqjd,16,t5_2s7gl
2618664,0,t1_cn0cqz9,I am sorry if I sound rude. I dont think anyone would have any idea who that person is. There are many trolls and countertrolls on ctfxc vlogs and the fact that they are in the top comments is quite frustrating. ,CTFxC,cn0ebi0,6,t5_2s7gl
2874797,0,t1_cnuihfz,Crazy people with too much free time. My observation in this situation is many women who have had bad relationships regard Charles as their bad exboyfriendshusbands. When they see Charles they see their bad partners and put themselves in Allis shoes. That is the reason they victimise Alli Speed. They cant see Allis flaws because it see themselves when they see Alli Speed. I feel bad for them but they seriously need to resolve their own problems. Its not fair to put all the blame on Charles. ,CTFxC,cnuv58t,0,t5_2s7gl

3332774,0,t3_2ybrsf,I dont think its awkward at all hes said countless times that him and Alli are still friends and have no problems whatsoever. I think fans just blow things out of proportion just because he doesnt put Alli in the videos whenever theyre at the same place Playlist Wedding etc. I can see why he doesnt because the haters might crawl out of their holes and say stuff like wow that was so awkward look how awkward they are when it couldve been the most nonawkward thing. To be honest I hope he puts a clip in one of his vlogs of him hanging out with her just so everyone can see its cool between them but I can understand why he hasnt. ,CTFxC,cp85ut6,9,t5_2s7gl

4583548,0,t3_3dsvx2,Old news... but the lady is still hung up on chaz commenting on his new girlfriends facebook. From everything she said only one thing stuck to me. Charles and Alli were already meeting divorce lawyers since mid . People dont believe that divorce is a long time coming and they have been struggling to stay together even though he was telling the truth. ,CTFxC,ct8cw48,14,t5_2s7gl

I wouldnt say Im a fan of their music but I do appreciate that We The Kings are really close to their fans.  Ive been watching since day   and along the way Ive picked up watching the DLV the Shaytards Tim de la Ghetto among others and its just amazing how they tackle life and its challenges.  All of them especially Charles make me look for the positives that life has to offer and make me realize that no matter how shitty things get your attitude really goes a long way. ,CTFxC,cx70mqw,3,t5_2s7gl

7346902,0,t1_d2d56zd,Who says she is depressed or bitter about the divorce? You took my comment way out of context. Im not saying she is depressed about Charles. Like I mention she has times in her life when she is down. She has even said that she doesnt know why she is down sometime. Why I brought up Charles was because she has been having these down times for years even when she was with him. Anyway everyone gets down sometime Alli just chooses to talk about it on camera. I dont know why you are so sure that she is sitting home bitter about Charles and Allie? Alli world doesnt revolve around them and the same for them about her.She hasnt said anything to or about them. We have no idea what or who that tweet was about. I remember Lauren tweeting something a few months ago about people being gullible and fans automatically assume it was about Charles. I mean really? Fans need to get over it.                                                                                                                                                       ,CTFxC,d2daj5s,12,t5_2s7gl
7607366,0,t1_d36saee,I dont have aggressive anger to anyone. I call things as I see it. You know for how long this CTFxC fan base was bragged about being the most kind helpful and concerned fanbase of any Youtuber or any internet star around by Charles? And look what everyone did to him when he kinda needed everyone most? It went up in flames. People turned on each other slit throats spit out rumors plain falsities and flat out made everything concerning Charles and the CTFxC so toxic at times you couldnt be around it or risk people thinking you were a son of a bitch like the other shitty members. Its YOU guys making yourselves look bad. Im just telling you so as NO ONE seems to realize that. And if you look at it you know the honest truth why the videos arent doing well his subscriber count is so low. The divorce. People who chose to stay with Charles stayed with Charles those who chose Alli went with Alli and those who didnt follow Alli but still hated Charles just dropped out. THAT is the gods honest truth. People got all petty and chose sides like a team or two heartthrobs in a tween Vampire movie. It was all and still mostly all about them. That and the fact that Allie is in them drove people away too. You cant deny it.You say Charles isnt the most interesting vlogger around but had almost . million subscribers at one point and you know if he were still with Alli Speed by now hed have atleast  or  million subs.Im pointing out hypocrisy and pettiness. I dont hate anyone. Im showing you what the real truth is and how to some people within the CTFxC that were embarrassed by most peoples actions and embarrassed to be called CTFxCers because were associated with that. Bottom line that facade the CTFxC had built up as a fan base fell away at the first sign of major trouble and you all ate your own. Its amazing what a divorce and girlfriend will do to people when their entire little naive world comes crashing down. Its why I say the CTFxC is dead. Its dead because most of us really dont care and we lost a majority of members. Were just Charles fans now who also love and watch Alli Speed aswell and wish her nothing but the best. You found someone different to watch cool. More power to you. But dont also sit there and tell me this fanbase is any stronger or as strong as it was to the point he should brag it up. It almost ruined him. It almost ruined Alli Speed. It almost ruined Allie Wes. Most have stabbed him in the back more times than you can count. That doesnt make me hate YOU the people. It makes me hate the hypocrisy and excuses you all seem to have. I dont KNOW you people from a fucking hole in the wall but I CAN tell you the actions of the whole group have been fucking deplorable since . Thats NOT off limits or outside the realm of discussion.So get it right and dont twist my words. ,CTFxC,d36x1wf,-6,t5_2s7gl
