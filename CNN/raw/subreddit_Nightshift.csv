Youre right the latter makes you a target immediately.If youre out to do some damage and you see  onlookers and  armed security guards who are you going to take out first?  The average joe or the dude with a . on his belt thats obviously paid to try to stop you?My deal was the same thing.. Needing something to pay the bills and that was available but after going to the first interview and finding out exactly what they were wanting and the lack of compensation they were willing to give for it I noped out of that one pretty quickly.Anywho..
