NoWill Batman show off his detective skills and will he have have inner monologue? I think so. Something like him finding out who superman isHow long has Wonder Woman been around? According to the sneak peak that CW had shes been around for a long time. World war  I think they said. Not positive How many members of the Bat family actually exist in this universe?  Dick and Jason imoWill we see a nod to the Court of Owls? NEW  I think that they can fit in this universe.  Have not read this,dawnofjustice,d0yrhoi,1,t5_31vbe

I dont even have to bring out The Dark Knight because no Marvel movie comes close to that masterpiece. If you disagree please explain why because I cant name one Marvel movie aside from Winter Soldier that even comes close to MoS.

BvS plasters a bunch of super villian traits on Jesse Whateverthefuck gives him annoying personality ticks and calls that character development.  And thats substantially more than we get for Superman hes essentially blank theres zero reason to accept or even understand Batflecks change of heart or even that either of them is anything near a hero of the magnitude this movie repeatedly tells us but never shows us they are.

7071760,0,t3_4cdqaf,So I just found out based off the DCEU reddit that they maybe putting out a directors cut in theatres. Im putting this here because this would help people who didnt like it get a second chance and just maybe the directors cut would help fix that but Im going to be honest here. I feel like this is an extreme low blow to moviewatchers. If this goes through WB is clearly milking everyones money. I for one will not watch it because I hated it and dont think I can stand watching it again but what I cant take is the fact that this would drive the box office gross for this movie almost double because we all know that anyone who loved the movie would be watching this one as well. ,dawnofjustice,d1hy3xj,1,t5_31vbe

7086216,0,t3_4clmjg,He kills one person.  According to Mark Hughes Forbes.  And if you disagree with him according a commentator of the article Mr. Hughes has an interview coming up with Zach Snyder so perhaps you can get him to ask the director how many guys he kills if you disagree  actually pretty sure Snyder is already quoted as saying he never shows batman kill anyoneIts important to note Batman is fighting a ticking clock to save Martha and that this is frankly a world where there may not be any absolute no kill rule for Batman. After all only ONE previous modern Batman film had a strict no kill rule  of the seven previous films starting with Batman in  and continuing through The Dark Knight Rises Batman killed directly or indirectly in ALL of them except Batman amp Robin. In this new film Batman v Superman he only actually directly kills one person the guy in the pickup truck firing the machine gun at the Batplane.Id note Batman shoots up the ground for several seconds fair warning hes going to shoot that truck and the guy has a chance to clear out of the way and save himself but refuses. Its notable that if you watch the scene via the trailer and pause it right when the Batplanes bullets strike the truck the guy is in fact GONE. The truck is hit blows up and flips in the air and we never see the outcome so the film sort of leaves it up to the viewer to interpret it as either Batman just blew that guy up or  for those who are willing to suspend disbelief much farther to have mild plausible deniability  Batman blew up that truck and the guys were all burned and critically injured but might not be dead since we didnt see for sure and maybe they were wearing body armor since Batmans seeming skintight suit is armored.Anyway I think we are supposed to assume those guys are likely dead even if Batman never bothers to check. The point is every other instance of someone dying is as a secondary outcome a consequence caused by their own actions not Batman directly killing them. Batman brands criminals and other criminals sometimes kill those people in prison. Batman sees a thug about to toss a grenade so Batman shoves another thug into the first guy and causes him to drop the grenade  the thug then tries to grab the grenade instead of running or rolling around the corner and Batman cant be said to have psychic ability to predict the future and how people will respond so all he did was knock a guy backward who was about to toss a grenade. If thats murder then so was Batman setting fire to a room full of explosives at Ras house and leaving all those ninjas inside when it blew up.Notice by the way this is about actions in service of good  saving Martha  and the consequences of actions arising from other factors. Thats a recurring theme in the film and here Batman is taking actions to save Martha thats his intention and to act on behalf of saving her within the few minutes of time he has left he is willing to accept consequences of his actions that might not be what he fully intends.Which brings us to Batman shooting the flamethrowers gas tank. Batman does NOT blow that guy up. Instead Batman has a machine gun and could shoot the guy but instead he sees the man will use the flame on Martha and so Batman choose to shoot the tank powering the flamethrower. This prevents the flamethrower from working and the guy can shut off the flame and give up. But what happens? The guy turns the flame toward Martha trying to fire it and so the gas ignites in the air and blows up the tank. Batman dives atop Martha and protects her. This is no different from Batman diving at Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight and knocking Dent off the ledge. Batman in that scene was trying to act to save the boys life rather than leave it to chance and he knows his action could cause Harveys injury or death  this is a major theme of that film Batman and whether the Joker can force Batman to compromise his one rule. And the spirit of that rule is indeed broken at the end a bittersweet and tainted victory for Batman.My point is this Batman does not in fact murder a bunch of people in Batman v Superman. Several people die as a sideeffect of Batmans actions when those people making choices leading to their own deaths. Only once when he shoots that truck and it blows up can it be said Batman literally demonstrably directly killed someone even if it leaves mild room for the graspatstraws interpretation...,dawnofjustice,d1jl8ox,3,t5_31vbe
7086529,0,t1_d1jexh2,Theres a flaw in your logic. If the mainstream audience and fans are  separate entities how can the main stream audience already have predetermined expectations for the character of batman if they are not fans and thus do not really know if Batman kills or does not. Now if youre suggesting that the main stream audience is used to the previous cinematic versions of Batman your logic is also flawed since all Batman movies  except for the Batman and Robin one with the bat nipples had Batman indirectly or directly killing people.

Just telling the exact same story about Batman AND Superman would be pointless.I prefer to see a much more wellrounded character and quite honestly I dont think weve ever had a movie that TRULY got at the PSYCHOLOGICAL component that drives Batman like we did here and we certainly never got a look at what makes Superman a man other than he loves Lois Lane. That is just silly because you never get to see how Superman struggles with being both sides of his personality. Snyder introduced a deeper look into the minds of what made both men tick in a way that had never been even done properly for either man and I think that shocked a lot of people.Its called character development people.,dawnofjustice,d2ofwvt,1,t5_31vbe

Like cap punching iron man and seemingly feeling no pain invulnerability and super strength are very different but thats the kind of lazy shit marvel pulls no one wondering where the doctor is after bucky escapes he was specially sent ross ignoring iron mans findings before the latter spoke to falcon ant man getting beaten by spidey in that manner real original disney iron man realistically should have beaten the snot out of cap after bucky was down wanda having to throw the bomb at the building instead of anywhere else the airport scene which was unnecessary if iron man and the others even gave steve the benefit of the doubt he deserved that at least unlike in bvs where batman and superman were strangers vision being the strongest fighter at the airport but somehow cant knock out everybody quickly and bucky being reactivated what are we in a s spy movie. Thats just some of the flaws this movie has. And u give it a ? Ur a complete imbecile if u think that and u should not be watching movies any longer. Oh and the villain was great? Bruhl did okay but again besides loki marvel does poorly at villains. Zemo is such a great name and thats his backstory? Talk about mediocre. And u love iron man  and age of ultron? Wow two of the most disappointing and overrated marvel movies to date. Both are decent but not turds as u are so quick to throw out. BVS as everyone says is far from perfect. To call it a turd however is ridiculous. Like I said do us a favor and stop watching movies. Post this shit on a marvel subreddit where the rest of u delusional idiots congregate. Honestly  out of ?
