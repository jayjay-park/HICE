4120003,0,t1_crpuicw,No problem! Im sure little bugs like that will be ironed out over time.   Touching up on desktop is a little nicer also with the bigger viewing screen and all...   NINJA EDIT  Rotation seem to simply replace with a rotated photo although if you adjust the colorcontrastpicture settings desktop seems to make a samedate nd photo. Even still it doesnt seem to make the nd photo with a date of today.,googlephotos,crpwm4f,1,t5_38em4

8254058,0,t1_d5997ux,I assume ppi is pixels per inch? Can you explain that a little more for someone who is fairly cameraimage ignorant how reducing the pixels per inch is different than reducing the mega pixels? My naive impression is that reducing the megapixels aka the number of millions of pixels would be the same as reducing the pixels per inch assuming that is in fact pixels per inch.Thanks in advance.,googlephotos,d59barx,1,t5_38em4

10022023,0,t1_dbdunr8,There isnt currently a way to download multiple photos from within the Google Photos app but you can from the Google Drive app.     It might already be on your phone but if not download Google Drive. Go into Settings and check the box that says if you want Google Photos to show up in your drive. You should then see a Google Photos folder on the left hand side of Google Drive.   To download multiple photos Open the Drive app and select the Google Photos folder from the main menu. From there you can multiselect your photos then use the Download button.,googlephotos,dbdwbgp,1,t5_38em4

10138662,0,t3_5l5k38,My phone HDR function sucks and a shaky hand can totally ruin it. So I use a manual camera app Camera FV to take a bunch of photos with different exposures Bracketing then upload them to GP. After a few minutes an HDR was generated and it is mindblowing...,googlephotos,dbt2lrd,2,t5_38em4
10232788,0,t3_5hkhy1,This is kind of late but you should check under Hide amp Show People in the app. Its under people and its the button in the top right corner next to the search bar.,googlephotos,dc3xzsc,1,t5_38em4

11519733,0,t3_61y00t,The app will go through all your photos and look for different ones or changed ones. Then update accordingly. Updated my wifes phone from a  to a  and it had to sort k worth of photos.  Left it on and app open all night was done by morning. No changes. ,googlephotos,dg1rhqk,2,t5_38em4
