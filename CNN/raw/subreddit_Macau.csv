570336,0,t1_cg53js7,I agree. Maybe within the next ten years the government should start caring about the locals Chinese or not. The government should also increase the payment of workers just saying. ,Macau,cg53oti,2,t5_2skxf

8591628,0,t1_d6fgnnp,Why Taipa as opposed to what looks like the main city of Macau?  Also I was just looking over the city and Ive noticed a strange amount of casinos and gambling places whats up with that?  Ohhh I see I was worried I would have to take a ferry or cross a border or something thats a relief.  Can you walk through this tunnel or do you need a car or something?  Thats also a big consideration for me as Ive always preferred walking or cycling places Im not sure about bicycle infrastructure here so Im just gonna stick to walking at the moment PI dont plan on living on campus!  The main reason Im doing this is to experience a different culture and environment than what Im used to so everywhere Im looking in Asia at the moment Im looking to rent an apartment in the city but not on university grounds.Yes fall !  Im in the final year of high school in Canada but application deadlines for most universities are around November or so.  So Im spending the next couple months researching then sending out applications by October.  I cant seem to locate the deadline for the University of Macau specifically on their website...but I assume its around the same and Ill be safe for now at least.  Also UMAC would be the best place to study history right?  Oh and could you tell me a bit more about the costs of living here?  Mainly the range monthly rent could be for an average small apartment cost of food and basic living supplies and also I am wondering about the price of electronics such as a phone or PC parts hobby of mine P.Oh and ONE more question.  Currently the most feasible and likely options for me seem to be the Philippines ManilaQuezon City and Malaysia Kuala Lumpur presumably.  Would you recommend Macau over these countries or would one of them be more suitable for an international student?Sorry for the wall of text and all the questions but I want to make sure Im well informed on this.  Moving continents is something you gotta think about to say the least...EDIT Also weird and specific question but is healthcare subsidized?  As in prescriptions specifically since I need two ,Macau,d6fjl13,1,t5_2skxf
8724167,0,t3_4zihly,I had a taxi tonight that was absolutely horrendous. Drove like a madwoman and couldnt understand a lick of English. Uber provides a better service  fact. Thats why the taxis are losing business. Whomever owns the taxi service must have their lips firmly planted on the governments ass.,Macau,d6w5uti,3,t5_2skxf
