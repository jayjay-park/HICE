3428641,0,t1_cpikq49,One thing you could always do if youd like to use quick cast and only want instacast for hog is keep settings on instacast but then in game press k and you can change your  abilities to quick cast. This would make your actives be on insta while your abilities are on quick. Only downside is you would have to do this for every single god I think,SmiteXenia,cpj39yl,2,t5_35ghh

4809968,0,t1_ctzyb9y,I did have a longer ass reply with data and crap but power cuts op.Mozilla just spent  years switching Firefox over to process per tab. It is default in Septembers beta release and should be default in stable by the end of the year presuming no bugs.Comparing Firefox multiprocess to normal Firefox it is faster and actually uses less ram for the same number of tabs compared to turning it off.Chrome uses more memory still due to larger caches it is also why it is generally faster than most other browsers in day to day browsing because it already has most stuff in the cache. It is by design not by software fault or poor architecture.Edge is also process per tab and uses less ram than both it also scores higher on benchmarks. If you want performance run Edge.Personally I use  browsers at work daily and several at home. Other than the really bad ones IE Samsung and HTC browsers UC browser and Ship Browser they are all pretty damn good for the regular user. At home I use Chrome because it has the best dev tools other than Edge but MS got a lot of bad blood to make up for and it syncs with my phone tv tablet etc without me having to do anything. If I ran on a Mac Id use Safari. If I had a Firefox OS phone Id run Firefox.  If it was me  years ago Id run Opera.Im just sick of people badmouthing Chrome when they have no idea why Chrome does what it does. And people trusting Windows task manager when it lies about memory usage not really lying it just reports virtual address space allocation as memory usage which is not correct. Much better to use the memory tab in Chrome or Firefox if you want accurate readings other rd party tools are available and the sources for what Chrome and FF do is available if you dont trust it.As for bias on the Chrome team. Of course they will be pro Chrome but generally they are just pro web. Some have worked for Mozilla Opera and other browser vendors. There is no bias to their tech talks when they are about general stuff obviously ones centered around Google specific tech like push notifications or search are going to be biased and you can see developers from Mozilla Microsoft and Opera in the crowd at most of them if you know who to look for of course.I like the current ecosystem of browsers each one is pushing the rest to get better. The only exception is Safari because Apple do what they want at the detriment to us poor software developers that have to polyfill the missing web standards in Safari rip webrtc.,SmiteXenia,cu0u43d,1,t5_35ghh
