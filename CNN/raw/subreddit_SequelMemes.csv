11345414,0,t1_dfhxjxx,Yeah JJ Abrams definitely was playing it safe. I dont think it was just to do with appealing to a new fanbase but rather appealing to the old  the ones who grew up loving the OT. He didnt want to risk experimentation or development so he did what noone expect he lied he learned to lie. He played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctiary of his wor wait what was I saying? ,SequelMemes,dfhzdxl,1,t5_3iiyd
11406755,0,t1_dfoxphl,rplace is this big canvas the mods put up and people have been creating drawings by placing pixels on it. theres this cult that formed called The Blue Corner they have an official sub too lol and it was literally just people declaring war on the other colors before taking over a huge corner of the canvas with dark blue pixels. They swallowed up all the drawings over there with no regrets before forging a truce with Rainbow Road. Now its more of a controlled spread because they think of themselves as merciful gods.,SequelMemes,dfoxwsc,33,t5_3iiyd

11605557,0,t1_dgas3d6, I respectfully disagree. I think that theory is very wrong. The entire point of the star wars series is to Bring balance to the force What the lightside of the force represents is the balance of the force. The balance of all the natural forces in the world in a perfect harmony brought about by its practitioners walking the middle path of healthy moderation. What the darkside represents is the malignant misuse of the force and the chaos that ensues as a result. The darkside is all about serving oneself above respecting the well being of others or the common good.It makes no sense to me that there is meant to be a balance between light and dark. What balance means is all light and no dark. Sure people claim that because the Jedi forbade relationships that they were against love and thus the extreme of the lightside is just as bad as the extreme of the darkside. However that is really just short sighted IMO. The Jedi forbade intimate relationships for their members because they were peacekeepers and as such could not allow the power they wielded to be swayed from upright justice. Say that a Jedis lover commits a crime and as a result of their relationship the Jedi allows the injustice. Or perhaps that a tertiary party exploits the Jedis relationship by capturing the lover and leverages the Jedi to commit injustices himself. The Jedi were not forbade to love at all but to love everyone equally. In fact compassion and kindness were central to their order. Then on the other side you have the the Sith Lords who did nothing but feed their own desires and in doing so commit terrible crimes. I can never understand why people subscribe to the Grey Jedi have is right theory. The darkside practitioners literally murder people in cold blood while the lightside people try to protect and heal people and serve the common good,SequelMemes,dgbhztl,17,t5_3iiyd
