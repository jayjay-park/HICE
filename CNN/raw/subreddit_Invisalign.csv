5820254,0,t1_cxhl442,Yeah I was too. Though in hindsight a good part of jaw surgery and orthodontics is facial balance  aesthetics. It was a bit much though.,Invisalign,cxik65p,1,t5_2uslh
6221284,0,t3_3xp2gt,I use BleachBright because most whitening products make my teeth and gums uber sensitive. I DO NOT whiten with my trays in. Ive heard of people doing this but my fear is that it will make my trays look cloudy and gross. ,Invisalign,cywsjrb,1,t5_2uslh
6331458,0,t3_4296hi,I change weekly.  Its less movement each week for more trays.  Results in less pain each week too.  My ortho is a top provider I trust him.,Invisalign,cz9bfj0,2,t5_2uslh
7829674,0,t1_d3vjpds,I have both the retainers and the lingual wire. Yes it would be more convenient to not have to thread floss. I have one of those little brushes you stick between the teeth instead but its still an extra step. Keeping the bottom row straight was important to me though  Ive read the teeth can still move over time despite having a nighttime retainer. My bottom teeth moved a lot after I had braces the first time. ,Invisalign,d3w4exl,1,t5_2uslh

9491084,0,t3_5antsm,I try to have water nearby to rinse with if Im drinking tea or coffee. Im so far along heading into year  with  more refinement sets I dont really care and drink with the trays on. New set in  days anyway Ive decided I care more about having them in more than staining.You arent supposed to drink hot liquids with them in but again see above. I figure if my mouth isnt burned then any potential tray warping is minimal.,Invisalign,d9iz97q,1,t5_2uslh
9712049,0,t1_da97jsw,Has your issue improved yet? I just took a break from my trays for a day and by the evening I felt fine again and I slept with them in. Im usually a side sleeper but Ive been sleeping on my back more and so far it hasnt happened again.,Invisalign,daa7wqc,1,t5_2uslh
9743776,0,t1_dae3yzv,My teeth werent bad just a little mis aligned and crowded. By bite was perfect. They were straight after the first or second set of trays. But then my bite was off. Ive had at least three trays specifically to fix my bite. Im not a happy camper and my dentist knows it. The only option I have is to stay the course. Unless I want to pay another dentist thousands to fix wham my dentist messed up. Believe me I wish I hadnt done this. My teeth were fine before but vanity and doubt got to me. ,Invisalign,dae4s4h,1,t5_2uslh
9933420,0,t1_db1l2g0,Yeah I had a palate expander in for a year before Invisalign so my top teeth are used to moving. But my bottom teeth havent moved by force since . Its already gotten better though. I actually think the worst feeling is the added uneven pressure on the attachments when trying to remove the aligners. Im determined to not break any off so its quite a process right now with an attachment on nearly every front and side tooth top and bottom. I only take them out twice a day mostly to avoid the drama of taking them out. Also the naked attachments feel horrible without the smooth plastic of the aligner to protect the inside of my mouth. Im really excited about being able to change trays weekly doc said it was up to me and how I feel pain wise but I think I am going to do this first one for two weeks.,Invisalign,db2clql,1,t5_2uslh
9942957,0,t3_5hnk9l,I lost my th tray so I called my ortho and he told me that I could wear it the next one instead of ordering a new tray and waiting the  weeks to get them in.

10055883,0,t1_dbhr2up,This is my  concern since I drink a lot of beer. I got my first trays a few days ago and havent drank with them in but the weekend is quickly approaching... Based on most comments on here I think Ill be alright.,Invisalign,dbib0vr,1,t5_2uslh
10088157,0,t1_dbm4rnl,Then youre lucky! From what I understand they give more leverage for more serious movements. I dont like them so far but Im sure Ill get used to them eventually.,Invisalign,dbmi5rr,3,t5_2uslh
10091281,0,t1_dbmp46p,I had a lot of anxiety about the rubber bands before I got them but they are really no big deal. They really arent super visible when youre speaking or smiling. The biggest negative is your mouth my be a little bit dryer than usual. ,Invisalign,dbmws6e,1,t5_2uslh

10466307,0,t1_dcp6vz3,Go to the store and pick up a bag of those travel flossers that look like little slingshots. Use them to take your trays out instead of using your nails. Just hook the floss string under the back of the tray and pull. This should pop it right up and then just continue removing it with your fingers. Super easy that way. ,Invisalign,dcugnut,1,t5_2uslh

11000004,0,t3_5x0q43,Im on  of .  My teeth were the opposite  bottoms were great could barely see them move on the clincheck but I had a gap on the top I wanted to fix.  I ended up with attachments on almost every top tooth.  Those take getting used to  especially when you take the aligners out to eat. I used wax like for braces while the inside of my mouth toughened up. I also recommend having a tooth brush tooth paste floss and a case for your aligners pretty much everywhere.  I also recommend retainer brite tablets for cleaning.  The booklet says to use toothpaste but I soak mine while I eat dinner and they stay very clean.  And chewies.  They are little tubes you bite on to help really seat your aligners in place.  I found that even when I thought I had them on all the way theyd be a little tighter after a chewie.  They also helped the first couple days when the aligners hurt more kind of like rubbing a sore muscle.  I keep a couple in the car because I have a long commute and I was very used to chewing gum on my drive so now I chew on those.Best of luck to you!  I cant believe how much my teeth have moved in only  trays.,Invisalign,deetg2z,1,t5_2uslh
11061277,0,t1_de6f7me,Are you happy with the new direction? Sounds like a midcourse correction if they arent giving you your remaining trays. How many new trays did you end up getting? I ended up getting  new trays for my upper teeth only.  weeks each so thats another  months or so to close a small gap. My ortho said its possible to file my teeth so that they are more even with each other. This wont happen till my refinements are done. Im looking forward to that since Ive chipped a few so even though my teeth are now straight they still dont look quite right.And youre right. Moscow mules are my favorite drink!

11079527,0,t3_5y22r9,I just put tray  in today. When the dentist put the first tray in I was in total pain. It took about a about a week before I could eat solid foods and not regret getting invisalign. Once I got half way to through tray  I had no pain and still dont. Also if you have sharp edges on the trays get an emery board and lightly file down the sharp edges.  ,Invisalign,denurmr,1,t5_2uslh

11512104,0,t1_dg0q8qh,Theyre a little sore. I only feel any soreness if Im eating something thats hardish. The mouthguard Ive been using has helped me become used to having something fitted to my teeth. I had braces as a kid but I was a little shit that didnt do what he was supposed to. I guess well see how things go when I switch to a new tray next week. Im using one rubber band on the right side of my jaw but it doesnt feel too restrictive.,Invisalign,dg0wd9m,2,t5_2uslh
11535262,0,t3_64jswc,Two years months is a pretty normal and acceptable treatment length for full adult orthodontic treatment but obviously less is always welcomed!Obviously its hard for anyone here to comment without seeing your teeth progression and all the details of your case but it sounds as though your orthodontist may simply be providing you with good thorough care.  Although your case may look simple to you and appear as though there are just a couple crooked teeth that are already looking fairly straight your orthodontist may be pulling out all the stops and giving you a good quality finish with a great smile AND a healthy ideal bite relationship. Getting this right is a process and does take time BUT at least you dont have metal strapped to your teeth for  years! trays   weeks  refinement trays   week brings you to about  months of treatment which is still well within the realm of normal for orthodontic treatment. Keep in mind that multiple refinements are available so dont be surprised if you end up with a few minor refinement trays at the very end to get everything perfect.Youre investing a lot of money in yourself and it seems your orthodontist may just be trying to deliver the care that youre paying for.  Its very possible everything is going as planned and they are just trying to do a good job. The tray numbers and weeks are daunting but definitely hang in there and stick with the process for the best results  it will be over before you know it and worth it in the end!,Invisalign,dg3ivs9,4,t5_2uslh
