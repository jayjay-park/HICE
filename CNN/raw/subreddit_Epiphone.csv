10918327,0,t3_5vv6wr,I have a  Epiphone Casino with a Bigsby and I pretty much never have tuning issues its totally stock check my post history for a photo if youre interested.I assume that this issue happens most often when you use the Bigsby.  Or at least the issue is magnified if you use it more.Two questions How are you wrapping the string at the top of the tuning pegs?  Are you doing it in a way that minimizes slippage? Have you sufficiently stretched the strings out?  There is a lot of excess string going from the ball end at the Bigsby to the bridge.  That string section sits relatively high in tension compared to the rest of the string from the bridge up the fretboard to the nut.  That bottom portion of the string can use a good stretch if you have not stretched it thoroughly.  Tune the pitch down a little bit so the string is a bit less tense and you dont snap it by pressing down on it and then flex the strings repeatedly one at a time by pressing down on that section between Bigsby and bridge with a finger or two.  Be careful not to break them especially the thinner strings.Not stretching this portion of string really the rest of it too COULD make tuning stability issues.  Im not saying that it will or that it is the cause but in my experience if I stretch a string out properly I almost never have tuning issues.  The main exception to that is if the guitar has a bridge that is held in place only by the tension like a Harmony H then one wrong whack and youll knock the bridge out of alignment and screw up the tuning.,Epiphone,de65cnc,2,t5_2xe6g
