573661,0,t3_20p5kj,Not sure on how to make a huge scar like that but the method I use for small scars is to get some latex color it with some red to remove the yellow latex color or buy flesh latex   Apply it to where you want the scar. Let it dry Use a knife or some utensil to lift the edges of the latex Bend it so it stands straight out Apply some more latex around the bent edges Let it dry Apply makeup around the latex where it connects with your skin and color the scar itself.Its quite a simple way to get a scar that looks really good.atleast when its a smaller scarCould work over an eye as well but you would have to keep some plastic over the eye when you apply the latex and no need for the outer layer of latex when its as small as Zoros eye scar.Hope this helps!,cosplay,cg5hak1,1,t5_2qkju

1726144,0,t3_2e5xga,Using metallic fabric paint and painting directly on the fabric will give you some pretty crisp lines. If you want to add some extra stiffness to the general area so it looks more like rigid metal as the fabric will crumple naturally even with paint you could add interfacing onto the inner side of the coat between the outer layer and the lining. You might also try metallic ironon transfer paper similar to this. Ive never used it myself so I cant really give you a good review on it but another cosplayer either from here or from over at rcosplayers might be able to weigh in on how effectivelong lasting it is. ,cosplay,cjwqu0s,1,t5_2qkju

That is my very good pal yeah! Annnnd totaly something he would do. Unfortunately Im not so sure about the story  we were at Anime Expo that summer and never went to Anime Con unless the storyteller got them mixed up. I was also with him the whole time and dont remember the described instance but seeing as it was  years ago I may have just forgottendidnt think much of it. Id be happy to talk to the user though because it could very well be! He doesnt use FB so I could help her contact him if she gets a hold of me. Thank you ,cosplay,clho0my,1,t5_2qkju

There are a variety of shoe inserts you can use to make shoes more comfortable.Alternatively you could make boot covers.  This might even be a better option since the slouch boot is not a hugely popular male style plus boot covers will allow you to prioritize wearing a boot that is super comfortable.  Its not very difficult to do and there are a bunch of tutorials available online exampleHope that helps a bit!,cosplay,cnny8rw,2,t5_2qkju

It was really hard for me to find satisfactory white balances here whereas at other venues it feels a lot more forgiving. Also I was forcing myself to use primes this time so I had to go with broader metering instead of my usual zoomin to spotmeter skin tones.

But Arleen Sorkin was the actress who played Harley in pretty much everything else.But Tara Strong does look fantastic as Harley.EDIT I got curious apparently Tara Strong has played Harley a few more times than I thought and as with all her roles shes great at it but shes still not the original Harley. Also Harley Quinns character design was apparently inspired by this previous role of Arleen Sorkins?

4408422,0,t3_3bgjem,Wood glue is an option but its a lot of work.My advice would be to cover the foam in something first. Worbla wonderflex paper mache or even hockey tape. Something to make it a little more even that doenst have holes like the foam currently does. After you have this coating now would be the time to use the layers of wood glue. OR I suggest fiberglass resin. Heres an easy to follow tutorial on it if youre interested Its a lot less work and takes a fraction of the time since you dont need multiple layers or sanding most of the time,cosplay,csmkbb7,3,t5_2qkju

I stumbled on a pic someone took of me when I was adjusting the armour for one of my costumes and just felt so awkward.

Me? We arent in the public eye we get much more freedom to be who we want to be we dont have to care that much about how other people interpret our actions.Celebrities dont have that freedom.What they say and do reaches millions of people and has added weight because of their fame.  Denying this is simply pulling the covers over your head and pretending.Famous people influence how other people act.Nigri has decided that she isnt happy how shes influenced people and wants to change that.That all said Im a considerably more tolerant of Nigri than a number of the other posters here.  Yes she sexualizes her self and thats what she sells her brand on.  That said Ive never seen her portray cosplay as sex is all that matters.  Ive seen her talk a couple of times about cosplay and its always been stuff I agree with.  Ive seen her as a judge for contests and again she seems to know her stuff.  So she was selling herself not cosplay as a sexulized item.She has apparently had a bit of a come to jesus moment here though where she has seen what shes done in selling her self has had an effect on cosplay as a whole and thus she wants to change that so good for her.,cosplay,cu6ejzj,4,t5_2qkju

5115254,0,t3_3kzi3t,As someone else who just started cosplaying iv only done one  so far. Id say the best place to start with a static shock costume is which costume do you wanna do? He seems to have two main costumes.This  looks like the easiest way to go.Get some black pants amp black boots then a white shirt and Grey gloves blue coat and maskgoggles.But then these the one you linked which is more  Full body jumpsuit with coat mask  goggles. And then theres this  for a little extra help in case you needed any more ideas. But id say start with picking which one you want to do. Then set a price range that you would be willing to drop on this costume. Then you can start planning and making it.If you need any help making it I will try my best and help out p but Im still pretty new also so Dont be expecting any miracles now haha.,cosplay,cv2kvc7,2,t5_2qkju

5305891,0,t3_3njrt6,First I would take a look at all the different versions of link and decide on which one you want to cosplay. You can decide bad on which one you think looks coolest or which one is most doable within your current skill set or even which one is most doable with your available materials. If you are particularly creative you could create your own link with your own style such as steam punk post apocolyptic etc. Since link is so iconic and has a very distinct design its shouldnt be hard for people to recognize you and enjoy the costume. Once youve decided exactly what you want your link to look like youll need to decide exactly how you are gonna tackle the project to make the costume. This will depend on your skillset tools time money and motivation. You could go the easiest but most expensive route of buying a premade costume or take a middle ground and buy real life items to modify to look like the costume or go hardcore and make everything from almost scratch. To help with your planning youll want to look at other peoples link costumes and even find tutorials people have made. Since link is pretty popular you should be able to find a good wealth of information. After you are dome planning its a matter of obtaining what you need and going at it!! I think Ive read somewhere that a green nightcapwizards hat if you can find one can make a good Link hat. Keep km mind that if you are buying things from different places the colors might not quite match. From there Id just get a nice white long sleeve shirt an oversized green tunic like shirt a white something for your legs and some boots! That should serve as a solid base for your link and depending on which link you want to be you can accessorize from there!Sorry of some of this level was too basic for your skill level but I figured Id just share my kinda thought process when starting a new project.,cosplay,cvpw0kb,1,t5_2qkju

I trust that the OP is intelligent enough take in what Im saying and decide for herhimself how to proceed. If they just want to post a picture cool no problem if they choose to share more info also cool.

My guess is that most of the people who are taking creepshots are socially maladjusted enough that being called on their inappropriate actions would be enough to drive them away.  Then again they might be so oblivious that they just keep on doing uncomfortable things at which point informing convention staff is probably your best bet.  NYCC really made an awareness push with the Cosplay is not consent posters everywhere which Im sure creepy photographers ignore but HOPEFULLY help cosplayers realize they can report such actions.Although for the record Ive done some shots that sound like what you described and this was the result.  No way I would have attempted it without telling the girl what was going on though nobody likes having a camera  inches from their face without warning. ,cosplay,cw212zb,2,t5_2qkju

5857747,0,t3_3usmew,For the curled edges of the cape pipe cleaners or floral wire sewn into the trim may be a good way to provide structure without making it overly stiff! The gold shoulder piece would probably be best constructed out of foam or worbla with a heavier wire adding some more structure. I would highly suggest avoiding satins and all the shiny fabrics you typically see cosplayers wearing  they are extremely difficult to work with and unless done well can make an outfit with a lot of time effort and hard work in it still look pretty cheap. Learn about fabrics because knowing how fabrics work and lay is super important! Think about the character the way they move in game and their backstory  what fabrics would it make sense to wear? A lot of the mistakes Ive seen come from cosplayers choosing the wrong fabric either for the garment itself i.e. jersey knit does not work for a structured jacket or for the character would wolverine wear a sparkly silky material? . There is always room for creativityof course! But choosing the wrong fabric could cause making a costume especially one you want to be as accurate as possible an uphill battle from the get go. Patterns can often be found online you just have to do some digging! Search for cape patterns robe patterns etc online and if you find something closeish dont be afraid to alter patterns in order to make it closer to what you want. That reminds me invest in some muslin  a cheap thin offwhite cotton material that you should make your costume out of BEFORE hacking away at your good fabric. This way you can adjust fit and whatnot before making the costume. This helps achieve outfits that are custom fit to your body which really helps elevate the look and sell yourself as your character! ,cosplay,cxnh9eb,1,t5_2qkju

However even those imperfections can be salvaged and disguised if you intend to cover whatever you make with Worbla.

8431723,0,t1_d5vhysc,Honestly I would have loved to have added a hood but I was afraid of it just being seen as a genderbent kylo ren. Which was not the goal. I will probably play around with it some more and see how far I can push it but I definitely wanted to start with a near exact copy before tweaking it. I already added another leather wrist cuff for more symmetry and simplified the staff a bit but the boundaries will definitely flex more!! ,cosplay,d5vi8ci,11,t5_2qkju

8711515,0,t3_4zb4ce,I would recommend looking into textured zentai suits online. These would be premade that you could modify to accommodate the colors and cut you want.  I am stuck in the middle of a Flash cosplay and think I will have to got this route because the fabric texture the Jill Valentine has is similar to many super hero costumes on TV and in movies nowadays. Plus finding bolts of this fabric has been nearly impossible for me. Hope this helps. ,cosplay,d6ukqj7,2,t5_2qkju

8783608,0,t3_50eoiy,Lots of Pepakura plating and lots of eva foam?     Id go out and look to see what other Cosplayers have attempted.  Next step would be to look for any D models for layouts.  See if you can Download and print out any schematics.  If all else fails Look at Youtube videos on how to make horns and just make yours straight for the drill.  And look for other videos on how to make a helmet.  I know Im being captain obvious but thats all there is too it really.   Id say Pepakura armor plating techniques are your best chance for the price in doing  of the costume.   If you have any D skills this thing would be super fast to do.  If you have any other questions let me know! Enjoy! D,cosplay,d73mg4h,2,t5_2qkju

8975630,0,t1_d7qnjg6,Its a bit tricky since the details of the mask is pretty thin craft foam that is mm is very sturdy but that is probably too thick. I have tried to coat the foam with epoxy and it becomes pretty durable although it is a bit tricky to work with. I know that there is a thing called foamboard that is a combo between craft foam and cardboard. I think that it would suit this kind of project but it can be quite expensive in Sweden at least.Also for connecting the parts I would recommend contact cement glue it is cheap and easy to work with as it has some cure time. ,cosplay,d7qqgmn,1,t5_2qkju

For the outer panel I used wall vinyl. this And for the inner part I used plastic canvas. this Easily glueable together. They are very plyable and durable. For a face shell Gimpee has a pattern you can look up that you cut out of paperstock or cereal cardboard. Easy and looks great. As far as the canisters go I used nerf darts spray painted silver and glued them to an elastic band with clips on each end. As far as the silly string goes.... The best idea I have is trying to attach plastic tubing to the silly string canister having it on your belt or under the hoodie and having it run up your body to your wrist. They sell plastic tubing like that at Home Depot for cheap.,cosplay,d82uhgz,2,t5_2qkju

9292207,0,t3_57ol2e,Yea I have used a camera and screen setup for the Alphonse I constructed for my kids.Rundown I used two automotive backup cameras a small LCD screen switches and a battery pack of  AA batteries to power it all and his eyes.  One camera was mounted low at about his belly button and another at chin.  A switch allowed the cosplayer to switch between the two lower one for walking and the higher one for seeing peoples faces.  The two video cameras feed the LCD that is mounted in the chest costume is larger than the cosplayer.  It worked well for the LCD screen here as it was at a comfortable distance for the cosplayer and not to close to their face. rd camera on the shoulder just records like a GoPro.Here are the components I used LCD screen no longer available but as long as they are small automotive ones should be fine. link back up camera the important thing to remember here is that most backup cameras reverse the image left to right.  This one has two wires that work as jumper to either flip the image for a backup camera or not   Link,cosplay,d8tuqy8,2,t5_2qkju

9316282,0,t3_57z3lw,I dont think it will turn inside out too easily. I would suggest you put on the tank top and ask someone to literally put the ducttape straight onto the material while youre wearing it. you can then tell the person if its too tight or too loose. once youre happy with how it looks you can get the person with a markersharpie to draw where you need to trim some pieces to have smooth edges. using a scissors cut up through the back in  straight line. I would suggest getting a cheap hole punch and buying a few eyelets from a sewing store and press them into the holes for lacing. you put want to cut an inch out of the centre so there is a slight gap to give it a little bit of the corset look. Im not  sure but I would think that spray paint would stick to ducttape. this means you can do cardboard stencils of the design you want and mask of particular areas to do different colours. test on scrap bits of ducttape first. the beauty of it is that you know it will fit you will have fabric against your skin instead of tape and you can make it any colour you desire or leave it a cool silver with some simple black borders. that all depends on the costume. or ignore everything i read and try this,cosplay,d8wwo9e,2,t5_2qkju

9930146,0,t1_db1tjml,No problem Im glad what I said wasnt taken negatively. I just have had the metabolism line thrust in my face as another seemingly naturally skinny person most of my life so Im always happy to dispel the myth. If your tests have come back fine and you do have a desire to gain any weight I highly suggest a very typical MyFitnessPal  Calorie tracking route. Ive fluctuated over the years from  at my lowest to  at my highest all on purpose and all with strict calorie tracking. Its really not too hard to control it very specifically after a bit of testing around with food consumption. anybody reading this wanting to know more feel free to PM me and Im always happy to help you get started with a gain or lossSimultaneously most people dont realize the amount of too thin they find you is likely because we live in a fat worldsociety now and therefore skinny makes some people uncomfortable. Even when I was working out very controlled low body fat and was very cut but still optimally healthy my coworkers used to try and get me to eat some donuts with the input that Im too thin while they preach behind their beer bellies.Basically its late and Im rambling but my point is youre looking good and should do whatever suits you with your body barring negative unhealthy things. Personal preference that girls have more chunk is not health advice and it should stop being delivered as if it is. Keep on keepin on I hope life is wonderful and the internet acts less internety towards you in the future. More on point thats some very nice crotch mistletoe youve got going on there. Its quite a uniquenice take on Ivy. ,cosplay,db1x8ve,5,t5_2qkju
