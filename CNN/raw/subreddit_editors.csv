All of reporters though want to see tons and tons of cheese ball transitions in their packages. Not this reporter but theres one in particular who will get mad if you dont use some type of transition for literally every cut of their package. The only transition I used that I liked in this package was the edge wipe as the train was going by.,editors,cev6ho5,1,t5_2qpkc

179530,0,t1_ceycf0b,You will not be able to get the bigger GPU on the  and with FCPX the GPU is very important. The baseline  iMac comes in right at your  budget. But if you can spend a little more Id suggest first paying an additional  to add GB more for the GPU which would give you a total of GB VRAM then if you can stretch your budget more I would upgrade to the GB SSD for  more. Then in the future when you get a little more money you can upgrade the RAM to  or GB through Other World Computing or wherever else for a lot cheaper than Apple RAM.Its worth it to spend a little more now because that setup should last you at least  years. So as technology evolves so quickly its important to have a computer more powerful than you need right now.

375660,0,t3_1ydd8u, I would think the  processor upgrade makes sense when youre spending over  on the laptop. You might check into Philip Blooms twitter account. Hes doing an experiment where he takes the MacPro cylinder on the road for the next month. Its an interesting prospect indeed. You mentioned you use CS in your bay. Anything you start on Cloud isnt going back to CS. Once your company takes the plunge in one bay youre kind of on board. If the perpetual license cost seems a bit excessive for EOL software the Cloud subscription does allow you to install CS. I find the AJA boxes to be a bit more durable than BlackMagic boxes. Check out the TTap. I think its worth noting that the laptop has two Thunderbolt ports. This means you wont be able to use two external displays with these converters unless one external desktop display is using the RGB HDMI output on the computer and the TV is using the HDSDI or YCbCr HDMI output on the converter. Both converters are the end of a Thunderbolt chain as are displays. An alternative is the AJA IO XT  that will daisychain. Since youre an Apple shop and Apple wants the whole world on Thunderbolt having a box that doesnt end a chain will prove to be useful plenty of times. MDP gt DVI sounds like a good place to be. Dont forget DVI cables if the displays dont come with them. Cant hurt to have two HDMI cables on hand as well in case you end up using the HDMI port on the laptop. Remember HDMI carries audio DVI doesnt. Storage  USB  should be fine. If you look at Thunderbolt storage look for something that wont end a chain and cost you a display. Also make sure your backup situation is solid. I would be inclined to double up on working drives as well. Or at least bring something off of a shelf that you could work off of for a little bit. Google has found that  of drives die in their three months when they sit in a server. Sounds like this is a fairly mobile operation so your mileage may vary. Maybe you could limp by on the internal SSD or a Best Buy drive while waiting for an RMA exchange. Given the expense of this operation things slowing down or shutting down because of a drive that died probably wont make whoever is bankrolling it very happy. Again you may not need two of the same TB drives but you probably dont want storage to put the brakes on this job. Ill echo uschmattakid and suggest audio monitoring of some sort. As has been said many times theres sound then theres the picture. And half of the picture is the audio. Since youre in a hotel some headphones Sony ? are probably a good idea. Youll be up editing into the night sooner or later. Some studio monitors such as small Genelecs might be worth the space. Maybe you just need something off the shelf from an electronics store. Maybe the TV speakers with audio going over the HDMI cable is sufficient. Again given the money going into this an audio monitoring plan should be in place. As for an extra room I dont think thats a bad idea if the budget is there. First I like getting up and going somewhere when its time to work. On the days when I work from home walking from one room to another just doesnt put me in the mental state I need to be in for work. Second when Im on the road Im not great about keeping my hotel room clean. The longer the stay the more I settle in and tidy up but still there isnt always a good place for your general living mess. If youre editing out of the same room youre staying in youre inviting a client into your living space. Places you invite your clients are a reflection on your business. Its just nice to not have to think about the presentation of your hotel room. If the room isnt an option perhaps theres some office space producers are working out of and you could commandeer a corner. Being away from the hotel might add a rental car or cab expense into the picture. Edit  forgot to add a mouseWacom to the list. You dont want to edit for weeks on a trackpad. If youre using a lot of After Effects you might want a keyboard with a numberpad. If you dont get that youll want to remap your RAM preview button.,editors,cfjpaqf,2,t5_2qpkc

IMHO the only thing they did wrong was excluding the table for the producerclient.And the place Im working at now has suites sort of laid out like this. Its like if you took the traditional clientbehindtheeditor situation except turned the editor by about . It works well enough for what we do its just a quick glance over to have some good old fashioned facetoface interaction. Also since the editors workstation and the client table tend to be made out of one surface it curves around it really does provide an environment that encourages the editor to turn around more often so they can easily look at notes photos papers eat lunch etc.,editors,cful9su,3,t5_2qpkc

You may not even hate each other but think of it this way one day if the director comes to terms with what heshe has put you through it might hurt more to realize how much heshe put on you.In a way it might hurt more now for the director to have to deal with the fact that you need to make a living and get off this project ASAP but in the long run it might be far more helpful and beneficial to not just you but also the director.Id just be honest and say that you need to make a living earn a wage pay bills provide for yourself and your family and that you can at best clean up the project for someone else to come on board.Thats what I would do. I would spend a week organizing files to make sure they are accessible to anyone with editing chops note these chops need not even be of high skill but simply enough to navigate a project and make loose decisions.Be free! You are not obligated to this person! You are allowed to take care of yourself!

Somehow she gets it out of him that he spent a lot of time in Vietnam as a member of some special forces.  By the tone he took on the subject and the way he emphasized lot of time I got the hint that he may have spent some time as a POW.She says oh you must love Vietnamese food!

Its not a part of a personality its not an identity and its not an automatic measure of competency. If someone wants to edit in FCPX...good for them. Im sure they have reasons. If they want to shout that choice from the rooftops and on the back of their car...again good for them. A touch silly but ultimately harmless.Results count far more. If the person is a good editor I dont care what platform they use its their choice based on their work situation. It behooves the editing community to step back a second and realize that an editors worth isnt tied to their capacity to use AVID vs PP vs FCPorX WMM or whatever...and the diversity of editing platform choices out there should be welcomed rather than sought to be eliminated.I personally think the design shift from  to X was a pretty big deal...not really in the change of software but in the minds of Student and Professional editors in the moment. My observations in Chicago and beyond have been that everyone just sort of assumed that their NLE choice wouldnt ever become a risky or obsolete decision...it was quiet boring and stable...and the software didnt change. FCPX destroyed those notions. I dont think theres an Editor left that now doesnt believe that a software company wouldnt pull the rug out again.These things arent security blankets theyre tools of the trade and its time to move on.p.s. my intention might not have read clearly but i was actually commenting on the behavior in this thread and saying youre behaving from a stance of tribalism,editors,ckjxwwd,2,t5_2qpkc

My  cents is you should go if you can and basically want to.  College is becoming less important perhaps than it used to be but I think its still worthwhile.  I cant claim I used any specific lessons from college at work today but being able to experiment with technology and filmmaking was very helpful towards making me confident that I can figure things out.Also I know very few noncollegeeducated editors  this is at least partially due to my age over  under   and I think college teaches you how to get shit done team work and just a general knowledge of the world.  Having studied film theory some literature science history theater sociology and computer programming has definitely helped me in my job in a myriad of ways beyond just knowing how to edit. ,editors,cmivb3z,2,t5_2qpkc

3078581,0,t1_cogdfvz,What youre seeing is compression or expansion of the gamma curveSo heres the thing when youre working with RGB color you have a range of  for red green and blue right assuming an bit color depth. In the video realm the Rec.  color space is used and that only allows for values between  and .Generally when Rec.  video is played back on an RGB monitor like a computer screen its expanded so values of  are at  and  at  and everything in between scales accordingly. The problem is theres no standard way for telling if a video has been encoded at Rec.  or fullrange RGB so a lot of playback systems just guess. VLC is notorious for guessing wrong.The reason it looks better on your Mac is because the OS X media frameworks are more tightly knit. A lot of players but not all will tie into the Core Video and Core Audio frameworks and use that for dictating how media is to be handled and treated. This means that gamma correction is more consistent between programs. And this kind of attention to detail is why OS X is generally considered to be more media friendly than Windows as this kind of stuff can be utilized throughout the OS and is designed with media production in mind.gtThis occurs with multiple formats .mp .movFYI MOV can contain a number of different audio and video formats and codecs so that really doesnt tell us much about your file.If you want to avoid this issue in the future depending on what youre trying to do with the video coming out of After Effects you could try using a codec that is locked to RGB or Rec.  like DNxHD You can get the codec for Quicktime here and if youre on Creative Cloud you should already have support in After Effects. Just note that DNxHD is rather inflexible with frame sizes frame rates and bit rates. X variants of the codec indicate bit color depth and the absolute maximum bitrates like DNxHD X for p. versus DNxHD X are the RGB variants.,editors,coh3cb0,3,t5_2qpkc

3197075,0,t3_2wq6h2,Before I became an editor was working as a DP I was hired by DirecTV to work in LA I live in Toronto.  The job was technically just a cameraman position but it was very specific to something I had done before on a project I directed.  The job was a multiyear ongoing sporatic job.  So... they used the NAFTA system and got me a Management Consultant visa techically a TIN Management Consultant Visa.  NAFTA visas are surprisingly simple to get.  The company writes up a document declaring all the reasons they need your expertiese and cannot find an American counterpart.  You bring those documents to a land border doesnt work at airports tell the border guard that youre applying for a NAFTA Visa and they bring you into the NAFTA offices for an interview on the spot no appointments.  DirecTV had written a huge ish page document in legalspeak trying to justify my position.  The NAFTA agents took me aside and basically said ok we have no idea what this document says... can you explain in plain english what you do?  So after I explained that Ill be helping them get a camera workflow going and that I had made previous films that exemplify the exact workflow theyre trying to emulate they all sort of nodded in agreement and plainly asked but... youre not replacing an American job right? and I answered no. With that the stamped my passport and I was legally allowed to work in the US for the next year.  The following year it was even easier as once youve been cleared the NAFTA agents seem much happier to restamp your passport without all the scrutiny.  The only drawback ... once youre official done visiting the US as a travelertourist is more awkward because they try to ensure that you arent illegally continuing your work.  So... a few years after the job ended I endured extra questioning at all bordersairports with complementary suspicious looks etc. ,editors,cotdkdg,4,t5_2qpkc

3431059,0,t3_2zhqnx,Unless you want to get into graphics Id leave CD alone. Theres a lot more to learn there than there is to learn in After Effects. To say its massive is to do the word a disservice.If you know After Effects Id leave Motion alone. Motion is Apples version of After Effects. Its a paradigm shift from After Effects. No precomps no parentchild relationships no expressions quite limiting. The behaviour engine is very nice though. Id say stick to After Effects. More powerful faster at rendering far wider install base.Resolve isnt a bad suggestion. If you want to learn Resolve buy the Color Correction Handbook and work your way through it. Do a few Resolve  tutorials online before diving into the book. It assumes understanding of the software and goes right for techniques.Learning Audition or ProTools is a great option. Ive met plenty of editors who ignore audio. The axiom is half of what you see is what you hear. Audio is so important. I wish I had some good advice on that front but I really dont. Ive learned what I know about audio through osmosis over the last  years. Learn dynamics compressors and gates and EQs. Theyre the breadandbutter tools of mixing.,editors,cpjd7jz,2,t5_2qpkc

Im pretty sure you will have dramas if you are having two Avids access the same media. Even if theyre not modifying the media I think they will both constantly be scanning and be pretty much unuseable. You need to have something like an ISIS or EditShare system I believe to do this properly...  A possible workaround is to have the media drives readonly for one or both of the suites so they cant modify the database files. Im not sure about that though.,editors,cq3rysk,1,t5_2qpkc

3821074,0,t1_cqr78ob,The fact that it looks different in Premiere vs. Youtube doesnt automatically indicate an issue with the file exported from Premiere.  Reimport the file in Premiere and you can see if the export actually looks different.  If it looks different in Youtube you have the file you exported the ingest tools that YouTube uses which convert to many formats the specific browser you are using which may be using Flash or an HTML viewer and the API that the software is using to display the video.  The shift could be anywhere in that chain and might look completely different with the same browser on a different OS or a different browser on the same computer.  If I bring up a video side by side in VLC and QuickTime player on the same machine it often looks quite different between the two apps but that doesnt automatically indicate an error was made when creating the file.  It indicates that the file will look different for different people who view it in unconstrained ways in the wild.,editors,cqru1dt,1,t5_2qpkc

But you are competing with bigger players right?   for instance and theres that other one that feature films use Im blanking on the name right now.I like the idea that people can make notes as they watch.  Then when I review the notes does it show me where in the video they made the note?   Can I click on their notes and go to that part of the video?   Can the notemaker moveadjust their notes easily?Do you have some sort of easy control to move backwardsforwards through the video?  I find the biggest problem with streaming videos and note taking is it is very difficult to go back.  Like if you see something and then the video goes past the point you want to take a note how do you go back easily?  Often you try clicking on the little bar and end up  or  minutes back or you keep finding the right part but the streaming file doesnt have the data so it wont play until you go back farther.

Im an expert Avid editor and track targeting and sync has never been an issue to be clear it was an issue when I first learning avid but that was eons ago and I am fully comfortable with that system.  If this is indeed the holy grail of the featureset than I suppose it isnt a big deal to me.  I can however see that it would be important to many editors who havent learneddone that system for years and years until its become muscle memory. gtIf I have the SFX of the glass breaking why cant the sound be attached directly adjacent to the picture?This is a good point but again I am not really concerned about clip connections.

Western music uses equal temperament so the ratio in these changes compared to the change in interval of the octave will remain constant as well.,editors,crht8s1,7,t5_2qpkc

6104700,0,t3_3z5vpq,Hey.First take a breath and dont worry too much  the beauty of non linear editing is that the footage is always safe  the edit is adaptable  and the more you work on it the better it will get.If your director is going to be the in the room with you  use it as some time to get to know one another a little bit good relationships help and to understand what they want out of the final product.Theyll know that the first thing youll need to do is get organised. If they insist on being there theyre going to have to help you organise the edit  you can arrange your footage into scenes and takes. They were there on the shoot so they can offer advice on what takes they do and dont like. Youve got to get everything in order first in the project window  then in the timeline. After that you can begin to play with pace. Be confident in saying that you need them to chill out for a while while you organise things and get something together to show them. Its their job as director to make the process easy for both of you  if theyre not helping you to make the best possible cut then thats not your fault.  But thats not the problem right now and hopefully  it wont be a problem.Good luck.,editors,cyjjiwb,6,t5_2qpkc

ProRes Proxy or LT is probably your best bet but youll have to relink to your original files or higherquality transcodes later.Media management is VERY important in this case and I would suggest looking into ClipWrap or EditReady or rewrap using Prelude so that your original h files can have .mov file extensions to make it easier to relink to originals later.You can also transcode to  or lower frame size which will be smaller in file size but bitrate is the most important factor for playback.The time you spend invested in creatingimplementing a post workflow will be cheaper than what you would have to spend to upgrade your system which may not be necessary for the editing portion of your work.,editors,czuw62m,1,t5_2qpkc

You start with that... and as you get better and better you will be able to do shit movies that are tougher.But what promo  trailer stuff teaches you us how to tell a story with the existing elements heck you could even cut a VO or just do mediocre GF over black with like REVENGE IS COMING or whatever.... it teaches you how to work with music and cut to it. How to build setups and transitions with video and audio color correction to create a sort of look or to repair footage... alot of stuff really.

7273469,0,t3_4exwpr,I do a lot of promo work and this is my method a combo of the top two commentsThe first thing I like to do is locate a kickass track that the client approves of then I start checking out potential graphics that will help determine the look and feel for the piece. Once I get an idea in my mind of where I would like this thing to go I sift through everything and separate footage into categories then take the best shots from those categories and put them together on the timeline. Its important that you present these as chronologically as possible to form a sort of story. Some event footage just isnt chronological but you need to make it chronological. Give it a flow whether its working from inside shots to outside shots or shots during the day into the night. There needs to be an indication that you are taking the viewer somewhere and not just showing them a bunch of random shots... I realize this may not be helpful as Im imagining it to be Im not the best teacher.  I also like to start and end the video with the very best shots for the most impact. As my boss says the first and last ten seconds of the video are the most important so you gotta make it shine.Then I take all these best shots and cut to the music utilizing speed changes the sped up footage that looks like timelapse is great for this or fps footage slowed down on a p timeline and often times lens flares. I also like to do a quick succession of jump cuts on the same clip as it jumps forward in time. Mix up the beats you cut on or it becomes too predictable. Lastly I color correct and level out audio and add graphics. Everyones method is different but I hope this helps you out at least a little bit! Its really the same process for me almost every time I always always always choose music first. It can make or break a piece. Good luck!,editors,d24y0th,3,t5_2qpkc

7371290,0,t1_d2f4ktp,Actually meeting people at work is probably my  for networking. After working with the same group of freelancers a bunch grabbing lunch chatting in the halls or in the kitchen grabbing drinks after work etc. you just build relationships the old fashioned way. And Im not even talking about the people that do the hiring though that doesnt hurt getting to know editors post producers etc. can be really beneficial. I get a lot of leads from editors Ive worked with that either cant take a job because theyre booked on something else or because theyre booked on something that needs more help I keep a list of my favorite editors for whenever I have to turn something down or a post super asks me for recommendations. Companies like hiring people that come recommended by someone they trust.    ampnbspOther than that theres the more formal networking events I dont think formal is the best wordofficial?. In NYC there are a bunch of groups that hold meet ups occasionally. Blue Collar Post Collective Post Alliance TV Takeover etc. Most of these groups have FB pages which is another great way of chatting with people all over the industry and hold monthly bimontly or quarterly gatherings that can be as informal as beers at a pub or more formal with speakers from large companies like Avid promoting their product although the more formal ones usually involve beer as well  actually I think the key to networking is probably beer.    ampnbspI also try to get to as many seminars and panels as I can. Im not usually very good meeting people at those things kind of an introvert but I feel like they help keep me motivated. Listening to upper echelon editors talk about their work keeps me interested and engaged in the industry and inspires me to push myself when I start feeling complacent.,editors,d2g2cc1,2,t5_2qpkc

7543530,0,t3_4inuzc,The numbers dont look too far off to me.The underlying problem is excessively complex with hundreds of small variables each tilting the scale a little bit at each step. These are things like for a cinematographer at the upper indie level there is a perception that a woman will have a harder time carrying a large camera package this limits the movies available. Some of these problems are fixable some may not be.I think the biggest one is fixable. The biggest one I see is the perception that women only make issues movies. These can be wonderful movies but if the plot is about someone dealing with an internal or selfinflicted issue it generally doesnt sell well. Because of this it is perceived that women only make movies that dont sell well. Not a good perception to deal with.Typical documentaries are the classic example of this. The other classic example is Lifetime movies.The solution is for more women to make movies even outright failures that are external conflicts. Make action movies the especially plotless wonders where we blindly cheer on the massacring hero just put her in lipstick and hot pants have some guy rip off one of the legs and she strangles him with pants leg. Some distinctly external conflict Rambo is a great example there is nothing internal about Rambos conflict there is some but it doesnt really come through.I see a lot of women doing things that feel like progress but will be used against them. Demanding that half of a film fund be dedicated to women will be used against them. There will be a fund that caves for a while. The problem is that everyone will watch that fund. The truth is that because women do not have the experience yet those movies will not be as well made and so will not make as much money. Everyone even slightly biased against women will now point to that fund with a see what happens when we do that and funding for women made movies will shrink perhaps lower than it is today.Instead the solution is to simply insist I just want to make movies this shifts the funding decision away from men versus women and into whether or not your movie makes a good investment. If enough women start just making movies we will see the numbers trend towards evening out.,editors,d2znv92,4,t5_2qpkc

7829635,0,t3_4mk081,Just finished my first documentary in K. While I managed to do it on a very small budget it made things significantly harder. We used proxies but our budget got blasted on hard drives. Not only did they have to be large enough but they had to be fast enough and still be portable enough for travel.That said some shots greatly benefited from being shot at a higher resolution even when downscaled to K. Especially some VFX work looked much more realistic downscaled than rendered at native K. Im not sure however that my next film will be K.If you have the budget for appropriate storage and use proxies then K is no problem but for low end productions I think it will still be several years until it becomes the norm.Some higher end productions have probably recorded K for years but the output is still often just K. And while RED have gotten more attention it still seems like Arri cameras are the norm for Oscar winning films and has just recently developed K cameras.With K BluRay i guess it will be standardised pretty fast for hollywood fiction films and TVseries. Maybe  years.For news you might see K standardised in big cities by  years but smaller more local TVchannels might not make the switch until about  years.Cameras have become cheap but infrastructure is the problem. It is not just the cameras that has to be replaced. In that regard it might become the norm on YouTube far before news channels. With the release of K capable phones GoPros and HandyCams it might be the norm within  years. While K might become the norm I doubt it will be in every camera until maybe . A time where Hollywood will already have started the move to K.It is difficult to predict exactly. Perhaps some new technology will arrive to make it cheaper sooner. Or perhaps financial breakdowns will cause delays.At least where I live the latter seems to be happening. Production quality is at risk of going down in TVproduction because people are forced to produce more with less time and money.I wouldnt be surprised if we had to wait until about  until every platform had K.,editors,d3w498p,2,t5_2qpkc

8669472,0,t3_4yofzv,Yep. At this stage youre better off with local proxies. There are plenty of options for shared storage. But changing your whole environment for one project probably wont end well. Unless the client is willing to pay for it. Make sure every editor has the same organization structure in their projects. have one person make all the proxies for everyone else. So everyone has the exact same footage. assign a team leader to hold it all togethermore of a producer than editor at that point. ,editors,d6payue,3,t5_2qpkc
8673732,0,t3_4yofzv,Im keen to hear what you end up with. I am now in a similar situation. I need to setup our offsite editing room. My idea was to have a central PCstorage with a RAID  or  or even just two plain s and a GBe network. Ingest and backup station would produce proxies and store them along with source material on the central server. From it assistant editors and editors will edit proxies and at the end of their work will switch to online with proper sources and finish the damn thing. Schedule will dictate that ingest would be done when least workload is on the server. Id avoid LaCie from experience.We still havent decided will we do the project with MC or Premiere though. It depends on how many skills we will end up with in the team. MC could probably complicate things a bit.,editors,d6pu75f,0,t5_2qpkc

9318346,0,t3_5821xr,I started out at a local TV station... didnt even work in production or promotions but they gave me a chance to learn some things and eventually I moved into the sales production department shooting crappy local commercials. From there I got a lucky break into a new network doing onair promotions. Watching movies and tv shows and doing promos. This was the luckiest break I got and only got there because I was ambitious and knew the guy hiring. I had to bust my add at the new job because it was a level I had never worked before. Alot of  hour days. When that division was sold went back to a local TV station doing sales production again. Then two years later back to some networks to do entertainment promos... and hopefully Ill be here quite a while. This was probably a  year journey to where I am now.Best way to get started Start working with what you can... and look for any job thats close to editing. Not everything is editing films.

9346053,0,t1_d90mdpm,Yeah the av lag is also a deal breaker for doing full cuts remotely. However its come in use when I start an export leave and then upload it to drive when I can watch it from a bar or a friends house. Notice something I want to fix or whatever which happens at least twice on every project and then I can just pop into teamviewer and move this or that a couple of frames or adjust something in after effects real quick and then start the render over.The picture I posted was from when I was sitting in my car at my other job and had to change a cross dissolve that was a couple frames off. Opened it up on my phone did a quick slip edit looked at it frame by frame started the export and uploaded the new cut from  miles away. In this case Teamviewer completely saved my ass.

9400990,0,t3_59bvmr,The only major issue is if you need to sync the footage to audio since there will be time code differences.

9927551,0,t3_5hjdpz,Thanks for all the responses. I am going to go through and reread to make sure Im noting all the great suggestions down.I am pretty much a lone operator though there is some collaboration. Currently what I have done put each interview onto its own sequence and added timecode to the video track and outputted private youtube links for each. The woman who I am doing this project withfor is not technically savvy but knows the subject very well and she is reviewing the links and making notes with in and out points for rough chunks.This seems like a good approach as it helps narrow down how much I need to review and so on. However going to the next stage is where I ran into confusion. Unsure of if I should do a radioedit thanks for that term or just cut away etc. Also I see that Premiere does an ok job of auto transcribing it seems to need a lot of correction which is reasonable enough but I wasnt sure if I should do this with the master sequences or just the rough cut smaller chunks etc.So far from reading the responses I feel like its probably best to work only with transcribing the roughcuts and then doing a paperradio edit for those pieces. Again I am going to go through and reread all the responses and see if I am clear on all that has been provided. Thank you all again so much!!!,editors,db1l2kn,2,t5_2qpkc

Putting tune into learning Premiere Elements may be a good idea.Plus editing isnt that simple a task!

9985946,0,t1_db8nxav,Awesome that this video changed your view on FCPX! As someone who worked heavily in FCP for many years and has also used Premiere and Avid I can tell you a few things I really like about X The organization tools like rangebased keywords favorites and smart collections can seem strange at first compared to bins but are another example of metadata being used incredibly powerfully and flexibly. He did a good job of showing how Favoriting and Rejecting works in the video. Rangebased keywords allow you to label just a section of a clip a more powerful and flexible form of sub clipping in that you never lose the full clips handles which is especially great for docu work. Smart Collections allow for saved metadata searches that update automatically. All of this combined with the Skimmer makes going through hundreds of hours much more manageable. Audio Roles are really great while working in X as shown in the video. But they also can be used with a plugin called XPro to output an AAF that turns all of those Roles and Subroles into audio tracks for ProTools all nicely labeled for the sound mixer. I find it a superior workflow to OMF. Another cool Audio Role trick when production sound mixers include iXML data in the sound files all of that comes across in X and can label each individual audio channel as a character or microphone name automatically on import. Its awesome. Auditions are a feature that allow you to put multiple takes of a shot all in one clip on the timeline and toggle between them to well audition them. And even if the takes are different lengths thats okay as the magnetic timeline will ripple the timeline to accommodate the different clip lengths you toggle through. I would also say Multicam despite being a glaring omission from the original release works incredibly smoothly and can seamlessly mix different formats and frame rates up to  angles. And the Angle Editor lets you jump into the multicam clip and make all sorts of adjustments including reordering angles automatically syncing to another angle via audio waveforms or applying effectscolor corrections to an entire angle. It may seem like a small thing but the Trim Start and Trim End commands the equivalent of Avids top amp tail trimming are my favorite commands in FCPX and work really well in conjunction with the magnetic timeline.Those along with the magnetic timeline which is the most frustrating thing at first but is now one of my favorite parts about the application are some of the things I really like about working in FCPX. Hopefully youll give the app another look.,editors,db973gh,1,t5_2qpkc

Or much at that as Im doing this for free for my sis?You either have to learn it or something like it or hire it out.One thing you might try is to look for an Adobe After Effects template that does something close to what you want. ,editors,deoyga5,1,t5_2qpkc
11127504,0,t3_5yvv79,I started with a nonAvid NLE while working on my first TV pilot. After selling the show we switched to Avid and have never gone back.  Its software that feels like it was designed by engineers instead of artists but once you wrap your head around its logic it really is the fastest and easiest way to edit.,editors,detak9l,15,t5_2qpkc
11186612,0,t1_dezwzl0,Ive just tested this. Compared to merged clips I can see the benefit given the fact that merged clips dont function correctly at the moment. However its not so useful when it comes to working with multichannel audio unless youre prepared to go into every single multicam sequence and change the audio settings.

11210430,0,t1_df2ojs1,Appreciate your response.  Ive worked the remote editing scene for a little over a year now and have managed some top name clients but Id like some stability and certainty in my jobs.  And yeah I usually have to break through the barrier of trust with clients that I work with out west.  They want to guarantee a fast turnaround and that the footage can be transferred easily across platforms.  I think the majority of freelance editing is coming from mom and pops startups and other organizations who have no clue how to secure someone locally or of course no one is available locally.Within your position whyd you turn from editing to Producer?  Were you based in LA when you first began editing?,editors,df2ou2o,1,t5_2qpkc

11336552,0,t3_61s27p,Hi this is my first post on this page and Im apologizing in advance for the vagueness of my question and the fact that this is probably asked daily.Anyway Im just about to graduate and I was curious if anyone might be able to point me someone who hasnt worked on any pro jobs only student films and free stuff in the right direction as to where to try to look for jobs to break into tv I know that you dont get to be picky when starting out but in a perfect world Id love to end up as tv editor lol.  One of my professors told me about filmandtvpro.com staffmeup.com and Ive found entertainmentcareers.net so Im curious if those are good places to look.Also Id like to learn more about post houses as Im not really familiar with what they actually are and if they are a good place to look at as well.Thanks for reading!,editors,dfgz8ho,1,t5_2qpkc
