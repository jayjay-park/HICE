3055542,0,t3_2v3zd1,As was previously stated the USCG does not have a repayment program. What you can and should look into is public service loan forgiveness.  The military counts as public service so after you apply through your loan servicer you simply have to make  payments towards your loans whilst serving. This equates to  years you can also piggy back this with income based payments. After the  payments the rest is forgiven. If you plan on serving for more than one contract this is worth looking into. Good luck. ,uscg,coepdy5,1,t5_2rcfq

The psychological stress is... considerable.  Im not saying that you shouldnt do it just be fully aware of what youre getting into.  Be prepared for the possibility that you will attend the school more than once before you complete it.  Be prepared to be an E until you do and your immediate superiors will likely be younger and less educated than you.to sum it up Be  sure that this is what you want to do not just some whimsical hero fantasy. Be prepared to accept that it wont happen through no fault of your own injuries knock out a lot of candidates and have a backup plan in place something else that you wouldnt mind doing in the coast guard.  Be prepared for the nonswimmer aspects of the coast guard that you will have to deal with before you even get to that school.

Another thing is If youre looking to be all tactical and a bad ass gun slinging cowboy Dont be a GM. The rate believe it or not is very paperwork heavy. Lots of accountability of weapons ammunitions pyrotechnics Training people to properly use firearms. For example I work for a unit that specializes on working onfixing large caliber weapon systems like the MK  the MK  and the MK and I love doing that.

6120173,0,t3_3yhpyx,The EPME requirement to have your name placed on an A school list has been waived for most rates due to the need to move people through schools. You still have to complete it to become an E but most rates will have you do it during A school. Regarding the housing it completely depends on where youre sent. The general rule of thumb is that the government wants to house you as costeffectively for them as possible. That said theyll definitely figure out a way to keep you and your wife together and housed togethergotta take care of those dependents! In areas with a fairly large CG presence Portsmouth VA Alameda CA etc. you can bet on living in govt owned housing which basically means they give you an apartment that they own and tell you that you have to live there. Dont worry though theyre not barracks. In areas with smaller presence youll collect the going BAH rate for that area and live on the economy. This might also be true for heavy presence areas where the housing just cant keep up with the number of personnel. It works the same underway or at a land unit.,uscg,cylatnt,1,t5_2rcfq

6672393,0,t3_46yvzh,When you attempt to join the Coast Guard you have to go to a MEPS Military Entrance Process Station. This is where every potential recruit for any branch goes for a physical. There is a manual online that contains disqualifying conditions for the Armed Forces as a whole. You can google DOD medical manual or for a more specific one US Coast Guard medical manual to find it. Being underweight is a temporary disqualification so you would want to meet the minimum weight for your height before going to MEPS or you will be temporarily disqualified. Its no a questions asked process. If you dont meet the standard youre disqualified.  Standards Being diagnosed with depression is a permanently disqualifying factor. This means that you cannot serve in the USCG unless the USCG Recruiting Command approves a medical waiver for you. This can and does happen. I had a waiver approved for  separate permanently disqualifying factors but they were physical ailments and not too serious. Ive heard mental problems can be a bit more difficult but dont discount yourself.I would contact a local recruiter ASAP because they will know how waiverable depression is in your circumstances. If you really want to be in USCG you just have to try. Plenty of people in their mid to late s enlist in the USCG. Being a single parent could be another issue though but Im not sure of the specifics. ,uscg,d09heeu,1,t5_2rcfq

11037056,0,t3_5xlkb7,Boot camp is hard as fuck and a lot of people dont make it focus on that. Youll learn about each rate there. Unless you really want to decide on a watch standing rate bonus etc. thats OS. Nonrate and IS is the same path. Good luck. ,uscg,dej14en,5,t5_2rcfq

11169554,0,t1_derl0j7,If you are courteous can get the recruiters attention and arent a general scumbag drinking shouldnt be an issue.  Give them a reason to want to get you shipped youve changed since then.  I know a guy at my unit who smoked Marijuana before put it on his meps form and still got in.  They were happy that he was honest.  ,uscg,dey22hk,1,t5_2rcfq

11334752,0,t3_61ocrg,I just graduated Friday and the only advice you need is exactly what they tell you in the beginning. Be fast and be loud and youll have the easiest boot experience. That means making the time objectives they give you and screaming as loud as you can at all times. IT sessions will be shorter the louder you are and less frequent the faster you are. Besides that learn to use an iron and get with the guy with the best boot shining technique. Hint its the guy that is using cotton balls not the one who is using his cloth. Have fun!P.S. Your recruit PCS has a list of TPO numbers. Write those down on your table of contents in the big book of knowledge theyll give you. ,uscg,dfgrvyw,3,t5_2rcfq

11470236,0,t3_63q6h2,You should really do your research into all the branches and see what really drives you. It is true that the CG handles many forms of law enforcement. There are a few rates that specialize in this but almost anyone can volunteer depending on their station. I have a good friend who just got out and was hired by a Police Department in CA. He was a Maritime Enforcement Specialist and that got him quite a bit of Law Enforcement knowledge under his belt.As a nonrate on a cutter even I was able to do boardings oncommercial vessels for law enforcement purposes. The best idea would be to speak with a recruiter at gocoastguard.com and see what you think.If you have any questions feel free to DM me.,uscg,dfw591f,3,t5_2rcfq
11502407,0,t3_642k30,I love the replies. I was going to say that the Coast Guard from my limited experience on here and YouTube seems like the type of branch that would allow this! Glad to see you got your answer!,uscg,dfzsqg7,1,t5_2rcfq

11599140,0,t1_dgaqst4,Well what you just said was rude and unnecessary. Not everyone knows all about the USCG but everyone has the opportunity to learn in a professional and respectful environment. Its people with your attitude that turn away some good recruits or people just wanting to learn or be curious. I am not saying that OP was correct in trying to join the service and not wanting to fight or make sacrifices. I am just saying no matter who the OP or recruit its our job to represent the USCG as respectful and professional as we can. ,uscg,dgarrsa,4,t5_2rcfq
