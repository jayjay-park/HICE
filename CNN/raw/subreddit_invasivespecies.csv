1222617,0,t3_26sil7,The Bradford Pear has always been my leastfavorite tree.  They are in so many parking lots and down so many driveways.  Theyre beautiful for maybe two weeks a year but then the rest of the time they are quite ugly especially in the winter.  Ive never seen them spread here in Texas however.  The worst part about them here though is that grackles love them. I dont know if it is because of the way the branches grow in that upward parabola or what but those stupid birds which I loathe with all of my being haha flock to them. ,invasivespecies,ci75vil,1,t5_2s89v

3984801,0,t3_362pr5,Heres the Oregon Invasive Species Councils  Worst Invaders list a lot of those are throughout the Northwest too.In the Northwest the the main invasive birds are common starlings house sparrows and pigeons. I have a few bird feeders on the balcony and while  of the birds that visit are natives occasionally starlings will get into the suet and I chase them off. My general recommendation is that if your feeders are feeding more invasives than natives take them down or at least take down the ones the invasives are using. Youre not likely to get nutria or feral pigs in an urban area but keep an eye out for nutria if you live near water and listen for bullfrogs. Also brown rats are a common invasive mammal.The big problem with invasives here are the plants especially English ivy Himalayan blackberry and Scotch broom. One of the best ways to help native wildlife is to plant native plants. For example red admiral butterflies love stinging nettle but because wildcrafting has become trendy more people are harvesting urban nettles which has been decimating butterfly numbers at least in Portland. So plant some nettles and other natives! You can check with your local plant nursery for suggestions for your area.,invasivespecies,crai43l,1,t5_2s89v

4571400,0,t3_3dktlb,For what it is worth a opossum is probably not the worst of nonnative species. It is hardly a predator and more of a forager and scavenger. Obviously I understand the concern and nobody wants another nonnative species. However not all introduced species become invasive though you do not want to find out when it does. ,invasivespecies,ct6u3et,5,t5_2s89v

4928625,0,t1_cufd3xn,A female zebra mussel can lay up to  million eggs in a year. These eggs will hatch into microscopic larva called veligers The veligers will float around in the water for two or three weeks before attaching to a surface with their byssus They will even attach to other zebra mussels as seen in this picture. I dont know if it necessarily kills the zebra mussels underneath when they stack up like this. They are filter feeders so as long as water can reach them they will be able to get food and oxygen.,invasivespecies,cufsjea,3,t5_2s89v

11049012,0,t1_dekds2y,I hate Iris in general its a plant that eats up an enormous amount of flower bed space looks ugly for most of the year then puts up somewhat pretty flowers that dont really smell or attract to many insects. My partner planted a bunch in our backyard and whenever he isnt home I dig a couple up and throw them down a hill. Also I totally know that satisfying feeling you are describing my house is on a hill next to a very dense forest. After ripping out the tones of English ivy it opened up a huge portal into the forest and the number of bird species suddenly quadrupled because now they can freely fly from my yard into the forest. ,invasivespecies,dekdxb5,2,t5_2s89v
