4896275,0,t1_cubp7i0,Hes a fantastic guy and the fans here love him. Hes really skilful has fantastic close control and works his arse off  great to bring on when youre holding a lead because he chases people to death.Hes much better playing centrally behind the strikers.His finishing is pretty mediocre and hes fairly lightweight and has a habit for diving. Nevertheless Im sad to see him go if he does.,Watford_FC,cubpq7y,3,t5_2xd7f

5842373,0,t3_3snvyg,Im home category C and can apply on Friday I think. Im away seeing family over christmas then so cant go anyway. I can try if you want? I benefit by getting another match recorded on my loyalty cards so I get boosted up for future games! I think same applies for City if anyone else needs tickets. ,Watford_FC,cxlgmlt,1,t5_2xd7f
8710464,0,t3_4zbn9v,Really happy with this very attacking fullback who has always managed to shine in a turd of a Newcastle squad.    I expect this means that Brice and Parades are both off.,Watford_FC,d6ug003,1,t5_2xd7f
