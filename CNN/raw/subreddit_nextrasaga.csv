11054802,0,t1_deky75b,There was a letter in response to her exhusbands restraining order against GG cant find it right now. She mentioned that they had not been living together for the past three years but she respected and trusted him and that they still did things together including travel. His FB page indicates that they do a lot together. She does mention something about not supporting his online stuff so Im guessing that he reigns it in a bit for her. Although his emails to her are pretty out there.Unfortunately I cant seem to break away from reading this craziness Thanks a lot! and Im piecing together a picture of a man who seems intent upon receivingfabricating bad customer service and then filing class action suits against the companies. In one document he even mentions that he is employed by a law firm to research class action suits. It almost seems that he is playing the crazy person in order to incite reactions from the reps and to be so hard to deal with that they just want to make him go away. The one about his Nextel phone is absolutely comical. gtNow take a deep breath and take care of my business. The damage is clearly done. Now it is just a question of how I go about collecting. I never allow myself to become part of someone elses collateral damage. I focus on the small stuff that is wrong with the system akin to each one of our DNA which has damage built into it but which fortunately with advances in discoveries that now begin to be dealt with. Unfortunately fixing our DNA doesnt alleviate the problems endemic systemic to our human nature which is now much more than epidemic it has now metastasized. ,nextrasaga,del1kbw,3,t5_3jecu
