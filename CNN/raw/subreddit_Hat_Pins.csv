7493315,0,t1_d2tqxw3,How it worked out for me... I drew up what I thought would be a rad design in my sketchbook. I didnt have a scanner so I took the best picture I could of it with my phone and put it into a vector design software... I use Inkscape its freeopen source. I colored it in in that same software but you could probably use GIMP or Photoshop if you would rather. I sent my design to a website that makes pins and what colors I would ideally likeif I wanted multiple colors and they made up a digital proof of it and sent it back to me with a quote. Once I approved it and the cost they sent it into manufacturing and I received my pins later.I believe most places like that will also help you with your design questions if you need it. Some will even take just a drawing and make up a proof for you. I hope that helps! ,Hat_Pins,d2ty6zp,1,t5_398i3
