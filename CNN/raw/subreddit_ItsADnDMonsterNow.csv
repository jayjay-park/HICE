7414738,0,t1_d2kxv48,Certainly one of the best options Ive seen. Higher rolls have less of an unfair impact per person because getting higher than high requires so many points that they dont get very far. It also keeps the organic flavor while giving the option to improve weaknesses as a sacrifice instead of improving strengths.gt Rolls average to This is probably the best way to balance rolls is to use the average in combination with various methods and types of die. I think that might have been what I was going for cant remember. ,ItsADnDMonsterNow,d2l0a27,1,t5_32tjx

9479890,0,t3_5akdkh,Harpy EagleWith the many threats lurking behind every trunk Adventurers may be forgiven for keeping their eyes straight ahead when traveling through the rainforest. This however would be a grave mistake and almost a guarantee that the Harpy Eagles will descend upon them. While these creatures mainly prey on Sloths and Monkeys it will take four or five swings with a longsword to fully convince them you arent one of them. Harpy Eagles have dark plumage ranging from slate grey to lighter shades of black while their undersides are white. Male and female Harpy Eagles bear no great differences with each other. They tend to be  ft. long with a  ft. long wingspan.Harpy Eagles are often trained by their namesake as hunting animals. However Aarakocra find this to be heretical and battles have been fought over the nests of Harpy Eagles. Meanwhile many of the creatures still lie free unobstructed by masters to hunt as they please.Example Encounter A mated pair of Harpy Eagles descends on the party. If a Small creature is among them that creature is picked up and carried off to the birds nest.Example Adventure A war between Harpies and Aarakocra over the nesting ground of a few dozen Harpy Eagles threatens to boil over into a nearby hamlet.Example Campaign A golden Harpy Eagle has been spotted flying overhead a settlement marking it for destruction by the local jungle tribes. Although these tribes usually fight with each other they have destroyed no less than six settlements this way. The party the newest member of the guard of the last settlement must tackle the seven shamans uniting the tribes and learn the significance behind the golden Harpy Eagle.,ItsADnDMonsterNow,d9hlmv3,6,t5_32tjx
