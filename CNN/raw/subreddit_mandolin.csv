421408,0,t3_1ywgi2,Have you looked at ffcp? You just need to know how to build a minor shape and know how its shape repeats onto itself. Same with  shape and so on. Once you apply the ffcp method youll see and know the patterns and every key will be unlocked. Honestly if you can find the   of a chord. It is not a big step to make it a  add note whole step down from a  or a major  half step below a  a minor flat the third.Know the major chord arpeggios first jazz chords are pretty much the same with a couple extra notes. Arpeggios are something that I constantly work on and my understanding of it just comes a bit more naturally now. You just got to practice it with brain engaged and brain disengaged and your hands and ears will train themselves. If that makes any sense to you. For me its one of those things that you practice a lot and get frustrated overthink it then one day it just clicks. If youre working on a specific tune target a measure know the arpeggio for that measure. Play the melody and then when you get to the measure play something based off the arpeggio. Thats a good exercise and I use it when I solo.I dont have the book so I dont know how you should best utilize it.  People learn differently. What I do know is that being frustrated is good but its important to break it up with fun stuff you know well. ,mandolin,cfog0cj,3,t5_2rsc7

1176653,0,t3_237zyg,Another folk remedy but if you have trouble developing calluses Ive read and had good luck with dipping my fingertips in witch hazel to dry out the skin. Another and probably better tip is to take the tab off the top of a soda can and use that to scuff up your fingertips. I heard at one point that is what Eric Clapton had done when he was starting out but that is probably just bullshit folklore. True story or not it works to build monster calluses quickly.The best way though is to just play even just a couple hours a couple days a week and it will stop hurting pretty soon. They take time to build up and are pretty easy to maintain.,mandolin,ci1zrx1,1,t5_2rsc7

1347120,0,t1_cil5gke,Of course learning by ear is a critical aspect of music making. At the same time having a notated version has its uses as well. Thats all Im looking for a version that I could use every now and again. A potential resource out of many of all different types. Also as I said before although bluegrass is very close to my heart as well. I am primarily interested in classical. I hope to use the mandolin eventually to play both and your advice is well taken regarding the bluegrass side of things! But it is only one aspect Im using it for and fluency reading from a score is essential if I ever wanted to work up to the Bach violin partitas or something. ,mandolin,cil60nw,1,t5_2rsc7

2012195,0,t1_ckvddz9,They make a huge difference. Personally I prefer a sharper point on my picks but I see a lot of mando players opting for the blunt shape which can make tremolo picking smoother without catching the strings as much. I love the tight snap I get from a pointed shape. I often buy larger picks usually between .mm. amp form their shape to suit my personal taste with a file amp then finish off with different grades of sandpaper. ,mandolin,ckvo06h,2,t5_2rsc7

Our local shop has had nothing but a great experience with them.This is sort of unrelated to the quality of mandolins but I feel is sort of worth mentioning. I really like Kentuckys work but they give my local music store problems from time to time by neglecting to ship parts of their products like the bridge and telling our luthier that they lost it. It got to the point where our shop discontinued carrying Kentucky products and started getting Loar to fill the gap.

9435783,0,t1_d9c1k2w,A compressor essentially evens out differences in volume. If you play a note on the mandolin the initial attack is loud and the sustain is soft. If you run it through a compressor it makes the initial attack softer and gives more volume to the sustain. A lot of jazz guitarists use compressor pedals to get a little more punch out of their guitar.It depends on exactly the context of your playing though. If youre recording you can just use a compressor plugin. If youre playing live youll want a compressor pedal so youd need a pickup as well or some sort of mixer with compressor capabilities.I mostly play jazz music on the mandolin so I think a lot about sustain and I have tried just about everything. I currently dont use a compressor but when I exclusively played acoustic I did. Now I play mostly electric mandolin.,mandolin,d9c1uxv,1,t5_2rsc7
