They had also renamed the city to Thebes after Zethus wife Thebe. On the other hand Amphion had married Niobe daughter of Tantalus. They had seven sons and seven daughters. Niobe boasted that her children were more beautiful than those of the goddess Leto were.He took part in the battle of Marathon in  B.C. and also fought in the battle of Salamis in  B.C. He visited Sicily twice and probably spent some time in that country as the use of many Sicilian words in his later plays would indicate. There is a curious story related as to his death which took place at Gela in  B.C. It is said that an eagle mistaking his bald head for a stone dropped a tortoise upon it in order to break its shell and that the blow quite killed schylus. Too much reliance should not be placed upon this story.But hold thou thy peace and keep thyself out of harm s way for I though I be in misfortune would not on this account be willing that sufferings should befall as many as possible. No indeed since also the disasters of my brother Atlas gall my heart who is stationed in the western regions sustaining on his shoulders the pillar of heaven and of earth a burden not of easy grasp. I commiserated too when I beheld the earthborn inmate of the Cilician caverns a tremendous prodigy the hundredheaded impetuous Typhon overpowered by force who withstood all the gods hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws and from his eyes there flashed a hideous glare as though he would perforce overthrow the sovereignty of Jove. But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter came upon him the descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame which scared him out of his presumptuous bravadoes for having been smitten to his very soul he was crumbled to a cinder and thunderblasted in his prowess.Bring me with all speed my greaves my spear and my armor of defense against the stones. Theseus and his army forced Creon and the Thebans to give up the bodies of their enemies. I must needs do this urge me not very much. In Laconia she has a sanctuary where she answer a person s question in a dream. And how shall it be his good pleasure?And from the sown heroes whom Mars spared is Melanippus sprung a scion and he is thoroughly a native. But the event Mars with his dice will decide. And justice his near kinswoman makes him her champion  that he may ward off the foeman s spear from the mother that bare him. Now may the gods grant unto our champion to be successful since with justice  does he speed forth in defense of the city but I shudder to behold the sanguinary fate of those who perish in behalf of their friends..   ,heythisisallantheboss,cxbuvyp,1,t5_2xo9v
