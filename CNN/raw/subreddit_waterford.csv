3163370,0,t1_coputs5,Railway Sq is without doubt where I would choose if I had that decision its literally a  second walk to college street and to the town centre. Also right next to Tesco Odeon TK Maxx and Costa. The apartments are pretty big and decorated alot nicer than your average student accommodation majority of people in my class who arent from Waterford live here and they love it. Its not exactly student accommodation so if you wanna mix with only students it wouldnt be the best place to pick but alot do live here I know they get booked up pretty early. Riverwalk is nice too further out more so in the middle of college street and the cork road campus about a  minute walk into the centre from here too. Unlike Railway Sq its just students so a good chance to get to meet people. Internet is pretty non existent here its wired but likes to work only when it wants too apartments get cold enough during the winter too and the radiators are pretty terrible. Youve to pay a certain amount for the TV at the start of the year too. Theyre quite strict down there aswell but you could kinda understand why. Dont be fooled by the pictures on their website they dont look much like that at all.If youre into parties Manor Village is probably the place to be. Most st years stay here cause of the reputation and again a good place to mix. Alot more central than Riverwalk and probably the same in terms of room quality and that. Have been interrogated entering on Wednesday nights so theyre very strict too but again kinda have to be. Alot of random room inspections too from what I know. Personally Id stay away from here but thats just my opinion we could be completely different. Manor Village  is at the front of it where its a good bit quieter if thats preferable. Insanely long post Id imagine so I do apologise! hope I helped somewhat.,waterford,copvrcs,2,t5_2se9n
