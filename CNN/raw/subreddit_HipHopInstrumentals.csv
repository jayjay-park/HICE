2347029,0,t1_cm1ruij,Yes its possible but not preferable to me as the artist.  Preferably its a complete experience meant to be heard as one unit.  But realistically I realize not many people listen in that way.  Im not sure I agree with the rules of the sub but thats not important.  I suppose Ill wait a few days and resubmit one or two individual tracks or take advantage of some of the other subs.,HipHopInstrumentals,cm1syk9,1,t5_2skk8
