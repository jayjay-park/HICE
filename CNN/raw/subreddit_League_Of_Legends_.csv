5887086,0,t3_3vvows,he just doesnt do much for the team. as far as an ap threat goes he is melee so its  reliant on hitting the hook or else your damage output in say a siege is . his waveclear also requires you to be in melee range of minions so if they push you cant defend towers without taking a beating. its not that bad but it has a lot of flaws that is the job for most mid laners to deal with,League_Of_Legends_,cxrbwuy,1,t5_38wos

6066230,0,t3_3y9k76,Right now Guinsoos is the best item in the game and has great synergy with Voli. If youre going top with the Bear grab an early one to press your advantage and pushing power. Guinsoos plus your W attack speed boost is crazy v potential and lets you do insane damage. Get some tank items and finish with Titanic Hydra and Steraks Gage. This will let you scale into late game well while still dealing damage. Plus the Steraks shield is great with your passive and lets you survive more fights. Hope this helped.,League_Of_Legends_,cyerw0h,1,t5_38wos

6735239,0,t3_47wspt,for the first i think ? levels youll get some champs that Riot company believes are easy. As of my leveling experience which might have changed you gain Summoner Spells Masteries out of game free buffs per OUT OF GAME level. New Champs every week try some out and find one you like then save up enough IP to buy it see in shop icon. A lot of the s are good cheapest champs for beginners like Annie Nunu and Ashe. Learn the game through them and when ingame follow the recommended build path  youre not experienced enough to go buying other things until youre level ish. Play to win cause thatll help you prepare for ranked yet never let that get in the way of having fun  be original. When you near level  buy some Runes similar to masteries just more diverse and you have to pay for them with IP.,League_Of_Legends_,d0fzdim,1,t5_38wos
6739581,0,t3_47wspt, What this guy said. But play whomever you like really watch some videos on YouTube for beginning League of Legends the game can seem overwhelming. If you have any friends you might ask them to play a few custom games with you. For runes I would ignore them till your account hits level  since thats when you unlock tier  runes. Mobafire is your best friend. Buy the items that the guides recommend and learn when it is best to buy certain items. As for champions some of those free champions until level  are sorta hard in a way. Garen is a fairly simple champion to learn the game with as he requires little skill to use abilities is tanky to forgive your mistakes and does some great damage. Otherwise just have fun. You have until level  about  games to figure stuff out. The major reason LoL isnt more popular is that people get overwhelmed and quit soon after they begin. Stick with the game it is worth it. Oh and dont spend any money till level  my advice. ,League_Of_Legends_,d0gfiiq,1,t5_38wos

It might be enough but if you truely want to carry hard work is needed!To put in context I used to main morgana and Ahri mid now I play Anivia for simular reasons. I had around  winrate on them mid and have over  games over  season on em. This knowledge has given  good things. I get to know the champ better and when Im matched up to either of those I never lose cause I know them in and out.Btw Id say Anivia wall and propper ult placement requires  games due to the big champ pool in the game so you get xp in all matchups.

8763780,0,t1_d711tzc,Also I checked your overview. Didnt you get  day ban before this permaban? Yet you still use your chat like this??Only person to blame is you.What about your account ThiefZidane?  I read a comment where you said  Nah lol I can say what I want p people get offended and good for them. Mute me. Grow some fucking thicker skin. Pussy ass adults who cant handle chat will fail in lifeI think someone with a lowself esteem does what you do they constantly talk rubbishspilling hate being judgmental swearing calling names and being negative. So in fact i think you are failing in life because you expect other people to change grow a thicker skin because you cant simply stop being a rude person?The problem is I should be able to say whatever the Fuck I want.xDDDDDDDDD sure bro sure... i think your problem is already deep in you because you spill hate on people you dont even know like what do you get out saying these things in chat?Someone that is happy with themselves and their life wont go around talking like you do that is just from my observation. one time you saidno if you cannot get passed toxic players by muting or ignoring them then you deserve to lose every single match. unless they physically threaten to come to your house and do something then shut the fuck up and get over it. riot is toxic because of people who have thin skin who cant take a critique and who cry. probably people like you. you dont have to type back you dont have to see what they say. thats your problem. if i want to tell someone they are shit and retarded. thats my right. if i do that on the street. who is going to ban me from the street? no one. get rid of toxicity by getting rid of punishments unless they are physical threats.Dude someone that is a good person and confident in themselves dont go around talking shit about other people. You expect people to mute you and accept what you say grow a thicker skin??
