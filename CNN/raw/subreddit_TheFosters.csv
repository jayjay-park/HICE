4794935,0,t3_3gj6ss,Goshdarnit! Jude even was in the previews but nope  once again no Jude or Jonnor... Were going to have to wait till the Winter premiere at least I guess. Looks like some minor Jude being upset about Callies probably failed adoption next weekIm not even going to go into this weeks storylines because I think theyre very convoluted. ,TheFosters,ctyxvhm,10,t5_2xm3c
7016920,0,t1_d1b85aj,gtWhat is not common is for someone to assert theyre gay and then backtrack and say that they dont really like guys and just dated a boy because they liked him as a person.Ive had that exact experience not realizing I loved my friend as the best friend I could ever have instead of in a sexual way. We did sexual things together because I was curious and inexperienced and thought it was the thing to do when you love someone. But alas I wasnt gay even though I thought I was.gtThe difference in growing up in an environment where homosexuality is normalized is the lack of pressure or expectation to be heterosexual so you are less likely to pursue oppositesex relationships for the sake of experimentation. Like I said I grew up in that environment. I know a lot of people who experimented with both sexes because they were trying to figure themselves out. If anything it would be more common because neither set of relationships are stigmatized and generally sexuality as a whole isnt either.gt Jude isnt exploring bisexuality. The conversation he has with Taylor is him saying he doesnt think hes gay or likes boys that he isnt sure if he likes girls because hes never been with one and that he liked Connor as a person.The conversation is coming from a confused teenager. His feelings are common. To like one person then look back and wonder if you really liked them like that is something lots of teens struggle with no matter what their sexuality. Most kids dont wake up one day and realize theyre gaystraightbi. Its a process and Jude is going through it.gtThis is nonsense backtracking on the part of the writers after having Jude a dozen or so episodes prior come out as gay to the audience.Lots of teens I knew came out as gay in high school and then backtracked. Adolescence is a confusing time and part of that is because you have to learn which feelings are sexual romantic and friendly. Thats frequently a damn hard distinction to make as it is let alone when all of that is new to you.gtCrushing on a boy for two seasons dating him making out with him crying at night after breaking up with him and then deciding a few episodes later hes not gay and doesnt particularly like boys isnt realistic.You can have nonsexual crushes. You can have romantic crushes friendly crushes etc. I had a crush on my best friend. I still think I was in love with her. But it wasnt a sexual crush and it took me a long time to figure that out. Sexuality and romance dont fit nicely into boxes and acting like they should is disingenuous to many reallife experiences. Just because you havent personally experienced what Jude is doesnt mean its not real.,TheFosters,d1bpsay,2,t5_2xm3c

10901545,0,t3_5vflcr,I feel like this show has took us through every emotion possible and went through so many real issues in todays society. Im interested in seeing what Emma does regarding her pregnancy  Im wondering if she will have an abortion as they havent touched on that subject as of yet not that I can remember anyway sorry if Im wrong,TheFosters,de4f0o3,7,t5_2xm3c
11290589,0,t3_5wtg0v,Im really glad that the show is putting this more in the limelight. As someone who is LGBT it was validating to see something like this. I definitely sought out different ways to learn about it and it probably wasnt healthy.,TheFosters,dfbrss1,2,t5_2xm3c
