293866,0,t3_1xfxff,Also there is a great deal of Jungian psychology in the lyrics of Lateralus.  The alchemical process that a persons soul goes through is described by the colors of the soul.  They are as follows Nigredo Blackening Albedo Whitening Citrinitas Yellowing and finally Rubedo Reddening.  The process that Jung based it upon was basically the holy grail of alchemy where lead was turned to gold hence the leaden grudge being turned to gold.  The album name Aenima is a Jungian psychology concept as is the shadow discussed in  amp .All that said the letting go concept crucifying the ego and a good number of lyrics are pretty Buddhist.  The whole ParabolParabola song if it isnt Buddhist I dont know what it is.

1881224,0,t1_ckfo439,thanks. I got the point of your post. I was just trying to say that if this was a song written by anthony keidis or some other hack it would be INSANELY personal. All caps. But if you consider the source when billy howerdell got to work with Maynard I think he damn well knew that Maynard would pull out some really personal shit and go pick some scab and come out with a gut wrenching song. Maynard does that often. and considering that maynards mom didnt die many years after this song was written yea Im sure she heard it too. If your son wrote a song with your name as the title how could you be like... Oh I missed that one. And they had a loving relationship from what I understand. but again she knew what he was capable of so Im sure it made her uncomfortable yes but its not like it blew her mind as much as hearing a song about her son getting sexually abused. Right?So. Your post was all about reactions. How did billy feel how did Judith Marie feel when they heard the song. And my point is that they probably said ... Shit thats rough. There he goes again.

5799878,0,t1_cxfslf6,What you guys fail to address is he was like this from the beginning.Theres YouTube footage of him in like something telling an interviewer what the content of the interview has to be about.What did the Bs happen so quick after their early release that by the time they had their first spot on MTV he was over it? Doubt it... Hes been saying this shit since day Another thing you guys fail to address I feel is no matter what he saysdoes I feel fans blindly justify it. Hes private...reporter is a douche...well hes sick of it... When if it was any other person most people would not hesitate to call them rude or an asshole or a diva.I mean the unreal irony is MJK has the audacity to say guys who come into the business early on end up being monsters because theyre at a volatile stage in their life and they believe their own hype meanwhile I cant think of anyone who makes journalists more uncomfortable than him. Not allowing them to ask any questions fucking relevant questions questions pertaining to the biggest chunk of his success whether he wants to admit it or not questions pertaining to the REASON hes being interviewed in the first place and shutting them down if they ask certain taboo questions like hes the leader of some small country.And the sad part is if he had the decency to acknowledge the fans to say how much he appreciates the support I dont think Id be saying any of this. All it would have taken in the  years hes had a career from people supporting his band is every once in a while to utter those words thank you. But I literally pose anyone the challenge of finding me more than two instances throughout his career where he genuinely thanks fans for the support.Thats why this whole thing feels disingenuous to me. I think he meant every part of what he said. I have every reason to hes done it before. I just think he reached that pivotal point of pissing people off and he maybe couldnt handle that? I do not know. These are all accusations. I personally think theyre true but theyre still accusations nonetheless.Sometimes I dont want to say stuff like this cuz tool is obviously one of my favorite bands posting here and whatnot and like most of you I think MJK is easily one of the best lyrical writers of this time. And I do like the idea that we only know what hes sold us... And that all this really has been to keep his personal integrity intact. I guess this is coming from disappointment in this whole thing. I think you have to be a special kind of asshole to be that negligent of thanking fans for supporting you I really do. I feel thats a given.,ToolBand,cxg138p,2,t5_2rfjf

I had pavilion seats but the lawn went absolutely apeshit when Tool went on. Granted it was Ozzfest so there was a variety of fans but Im glad I wasnt out there. People were lighting their blankets on fire and swinging them above their heads flaming pieces of blanket flying onto unsuspecting onlookers. People were ripping up the sod and chucking it as well as a decent sized mosh pit. By a few songs in almost no one in the pavilion was watching the band they were watching the mayhem going on in the lawn.

When I started listening to tool I hated heavy metal too but I loved Tools heavy stuff. Also they have some filler songs that are kind of weird just so you know if you really want to you can skip them. By the way tool isnt metal theyre rock but they can get pretty heavy.,ToolBand,d00uq8a,1,t5_2rfjf

6866131,0,t1_d0siart,I just saw it via toolband and was going to do one of theseTitle Adam Jones New Rolling Stone ArticleBody Via Toolband ADAM TALKS ABOUT A PASSION OF HIS WITH ROLLING STONEFor your reading enjoyment ADAM talks WWE and mentions new album Then I was going to link to the article.Then I was going to say Dont bother reading it the entire article is about Adams fascination with the WWE. Then literally the last line of the article is Plus were writing a record so weve gotta get that done too.Then I planned on putting a  face.Having done all that in this comment Ive personally lost steam caring about the album but this just seems douchey. Its one thing to tell your fans you work at your own pace and it will be done when its done. Thats fine. I think even the most annoying tool fan stops nagging because they trust tools art. But I think its another thing to almost prey on fans vulnerability by saying things like this because you give them nothing of value except reminding them about something they desperately want but youre doing so cryptically.Again I dont care that much. As a person who has seen other musical acts treat their fans much better Im sometimes disappointed in these  year old men who act like theyre in their twenties still in terms of being cryptic. You guys are  somethings you showed your faces in the last album...I think you can tell your fans a little more about the album progress in fact I think you ought to tell your fans more because I think your fans deserve to know more for the time alone but also because of how little you seem to care to let them in on a band theyve supported tirelessly.Easy to talk for an hour and half when youre getting a couple grand out of it in the VIP meetup but years and years into the new album no new news an opportunity comes up and literally nothing?Disappointing. Not as a fan. As a man on behalf of other grown men musiciansbusinessmen behaving less maturely than they ought to,ToolBand,d0ul4bl,0,t5_2rfjf

Basically there has been hints for years that there is a secret thing called Problem    the Riemann hypothesis. People have pointed to it being something on a format that may no longer be used today others point to it being some random album names that were planted in Europe with fake names from the import version of nima CD  Bethlehem Abortion Clinic Iced Pee amp Subtraction etc its just a weird thing that nobody has any real idea of.

At one point the main character goes into a Brian Wilson esque drug craze to produce his next hit and ends up doing all sorts of crazy stuff like ordering  didgeridoo players to try and make it perfect Like what Tool is currently doing.  It is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time due to the humor and music history related content.  You should check it out if you can its ridiculously funny.,ToolBand,d73nat4,6,t5_2rfjf

It might be a good idea for Tool fans who want a physical copy to locate a record store well before the release and tell the store that they want to buy it there. With so many people not buying physical copies anymore shop owners have no idea how many copies they need and usually play it safe by ordering too few.

11308463,0,t3_619tqy,Do yall just give up after  minutes or something? I went to just take a peak at other shows tickets before getting some for the Gorge and at  cst I was able to get matched with tickets for the St. Paul and Chicago show multiple times... I didnt get them or anything but it took one or two searches on the app and I was looking at decent ones. I think some people lock up so many right away and then buy others and release the first ones and then it cycles like that for like  minutes until theyre all sold maybe. Because even at  or  pm I was still able to find singles and a couple pairs too! Not saying that ticketbastard isnt awful but before flipping and buying at x from those even shittier sites maybe check a couple times more. Or be patient?   This is why those sites and scalper are still going strong. People assume if they didnt get tickets after  minutes everything is sold out and they go pay double. When in reality someone like me was maybe just looking at the tickets only to release them for you.   Oh well going to the Gorge HELLLLLLLL YEAAAHAHHHHHHHHHHH! ,ToolBand,dfdsphw,1,t5_2rfjf

11737921,0,t1_dgqa82a,No Im not wrong.  A ToolLateralus does have increased dynamics as a result of the HDCD coding. It doesnt matter what other HDCDs have or dont have were talking about Lateralus. I was around when the CD was released and we did some tests comparing the HDCD rip vs a rip with HDCD disabled. There is clipping without the HDCD encoding and the dynamic range is diminished. Ive never listened to it significantly since release without the HDCD playback enabled so I dont know how big the difference is but the benefit is there.  B Checked for clipping? How does the fact that Mastered for iTunes stuff being checked for clipping in any way invalidate what I said? I said nothing about clipping. You can squashcompress the dynamic range without inducing clipping. Itll still sound just as shit. Well maybe not QUITE as bad as something that is clipped to hell but almost. Mastered for iTunes is a very very bad thing if you are an audiophile.   And no I havent read that article yet as I dont have time right now. Ive earmarked it for a later read.,ToolBand,dgqiui2,2,t5_2rfjf
