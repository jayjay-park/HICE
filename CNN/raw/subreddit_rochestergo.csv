8486715,0,t3_4vx5s7,Im still seeing hitmonchans at high falls park by the gym. I see him about once a day maybe a few times. I dont know if you can camp at that park to get multiple. They dont seem to spawn all that often but when it does spawn its always in that park by genesee brew house.EDIT Also I see Ponyta in Genesee Crossroads Park downtown every day by the Sister Cities foot bridge andrews street.,rochestergo,d62dw5s,3,t5_3fd73

8780214,0,t1_d6yjgir,Yeah its definitely more suited as a PidgeyWeedleetc farming location than a hot spot for anything really rare. Ill need to take better care and note the times Ive caught things like GolduckTentacruel to see if theres a pattern. Sounds like theres occasionally really good stuff in front of Five Guys. I only have time to go at lunch though...,rochestergo,d7373rk,1,t5_3fd73

9687079,0,t1_da60y70,Im not sure it was a nest so much as a consistent spawn point. Only one spwned but it was multiple times a day.Doduo on the other hand is running rampant in that park.,rochestergo,da74ywp,1,t5_3fd73
