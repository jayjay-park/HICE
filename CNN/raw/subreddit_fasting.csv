Since Ive only fasted for a four day period I wanted to know how you dealt with food cravings or thoughts?What things did you do to ensure that you could go  days without food?  I just bought some potassium salt today so that I have an ingredient that will help keep me from cramping up and whatnot.Also what were some things that you did to keep you from being idle for to long?  I ask because sometimes physical activity is out of the question obviously.   Anyways any and all wisdom you could impart on me would be much appreciated.  Im aiming for a  day fast in the near future for personal reasons and would love to perform a  week fast too but unfortunately my class schedule and other responsibilities do not permit me to do so.  Thanks!,fasting,cggx6ky,4,t5_2s9dh

Say what you want about the government as a whole but the FDA has done a relatively good job of regulating what comes into the grocery store. This isnt China fortunately. We dont have to deal with lead paint in baby formula. Postfasting once I am back in the gym I may try creatine. Its been studied at length and proven effective. Possibly a preworkout as well since I had success with them staying focused and not tiring during my workouts. Aside from that all protein can just be eaten. I have to agree with you on the endomorph theory. Supposedly as endormorphs we need to watch our calories more so than the other three body types. Well if we need to eat a deficit somewhat more regularly than others fasting is essentially the nuclear option of calorie deficits. Yeah I thought about body image issues and eating disorders. I cant speak for others who fast but for me its to get leaner. Am I unhappy with my body? Yes. Do I hate myself and do I hate my body? No not at all. Fasting is just an expedient method to get a result I want. I do not look at my body and feel revulsion or disgust. That said I am sure there are some people who do fast who do suffer from these feelings. I hope people can be honest with themselves and decide when they need professional help and not a fast. Fasting when done for the right reason and in the right way is little more than a form of a caloric deficit. It just comes down to fasting being purely voluntary and eating disorders unfortunately being something that people cant voluntarily opt into. ,fasting,cjogfb8,2,t5_2s9dh

5972647,0,t1_cy2ihsr,Not sure if you have a medicalscientific background I do not. So apologies if I have to get back to you.The refeeding syndrome describes complications with patients who underwent a prolonged fasting under stress and with health issues. The entire article basically speaks about what happens if you refeed starving patients with too much calories at once.gtHistorically some of the earliest reports of the refeeding syndromeoccurred in starved patients in wartime such as Japanese prisonersand victims of the Leningrad or Netherlands famines. In generalthose individuals with marasmus or kwashiorkor are at risk for therefeeding syndrome particularly if there is greater than weight loss over a couple of months. Patients are at risk if theyhave not been fed for  to  d with evidence of stress anddepletion. However more specifically this syndrome also hasbeen described after prolonged fasting massive weight loss inobese patients including after duodenalswitch operations chronicalcoholism prolonged intravenous fluid repletion and anorexianervosaThe first paragraphs already bothered me. I highlighted the specific areas. I do not see any correlation with a healthy adult sitting at home who is not under stress not an alcoholic not in a warzone or living through a famine.gtAnorexia nervosa is one of the more common modernclinical presentations of the refeeding syndromeIt goes without saying that you should not fast if you are a diagnosed anorexic  this goes against being a healthy adultgtThe degree ofrefeeding is important in the etiology of the condition and as wewill discuss later calorie repletion should be given slowly particularlyduring the first week at about  kcalkg of body weightper day.This is exactly why I advise people to break the fast in a controlled manner and not start binge eating.I agree with your statement fully  water fasting or tea fasting should only be done by healthy experienced adults under medical supervision. But the danger of sudden death because you drank too much water or because you did not pop a pill during a fast is not really a thing. Historically people have been water fasting without ordering pills from amazon and had their results alas they did not do it for weight loss but in a controlled spiritual experience.The body is pretty much selfregulating. You will notice if there is an issue especially during a fast where you do not have any external factors contributing like bad food alcohol... or dietary supplements. ,fasting,cy2jmp6,4,t5_2s9dh

I have also had panic attacks where I couldnt sleep til  am or at all and had to just walk around aimlessly for hours to calm myself.  So no need to apologize for the ranting at all I feel you!My depression stemmed from the fact I also have severe anxiety and after HS I lost all of my friends and had no one at all to confide with my family relationship is also very depressing and I feel there is no meaningful social interaction available.  After closing my world off due to panic and anxiety depression set in and I must say this is the worst feeling ever and I am willing to try anything at all at this point. Anyways I have heard of people removing anxiety through fasting if even for a short period of time and have feelings of aloofness albeit with awesome mental clarity and basically an IDGAF attitude possibly because the mind is subconsciously focused on the lack of food too much to not care?  Anyway I will try to discipline myself and fast for a few days at first and see what I can do. I have also read it has huge benefits on stuff like skin complexion eye vibrancy etc and overall makes you look betterhealther which is also a very appealing can you also attest to that being true?Thanks again!,fasting,czyuv15,2,t5_2s9dh

It definitely is effective with anxiety in my case. while i started fasting for weight loss the mental effects are becoming even more important for me.Tomorrow should be challenging day  as Im working.

7942533,0,t3_4o1r0c, Type Ramadan  No consumption Length  h  for a month Why? Im not Muslim Im not a convert but Ive learned about the religion and I have many friends who practice the religion faithfully. I wanted to better empathize with those who arent as fortunate or able to eat much every day through this fast. I also wanted to learn some self control over myself and over my diet. I want to be used to going long periods without eating also Notes hating it and loving it. Hating it because Im so used to instinctively eating or drinking water all throughout the day but loving it because Im really impulsive and I feel in control of myself. Its not actually a problem to me but when Im not occupying myself my first thought is about how hungry or thirsty I am and this feeling generally lasts throughout the day though I feel fine and I know Ill make it to break fast. I just hate how much I think about my hunger. The fast starts pretty early and Im having trouble waking up to eat before then but eating in the morning has and still makes me hungrier throughout the day so Im really on the edge about breakfast. Im extremely tired yet I feel more comfortable and energetic. I get tired around the evening but a quick nap usually helps. Havent been exercising at all in fear of dehydration and I usually did some kind of workout once a day before I started fastingIts also humbling me a great bit and I feel much more peaceful than before. I cant really stress eat during the day which is good and I generally feel better about myself and a lot less anxious than before. Im hungry now but its more so me wanting to taste certain foods over actual hungry. Edit I also ran out of food and my car had a gas line leak Sunday so Im currently surviving off very little when I do eat. The only food I have is mostly cereal pasta chips hotdogs rice bread birthday cake and some grits. Not the best situation but optimistic all the same,fasting,d48tccj,3,t5_2s9dh

Finally I never realized just how much time I spent on food prep every day. When you eat  mealsday   snacks its just crazy how long it takes to get the food ready sit down to eat and then clean up. I feel an immense sense of joy and freedom now and Im not a slave to my cravings any more.I said I wouldnt be weighing myself but curiosity keeps getting the best of me.

8358571,0,t3_4u2z6c,There seems to be a couple issues here.. You shouldnt be starving during a fast unless your talking about the mental need for food not the actual hunger. If your hungry drink water. Black coffeetea no sugar also helps. I think IF and fasts should be convenient and match your lifestyle no point in forcing yourself to do something at  for a month and quit when you can do it at  for years. That being said dont be lazy try it out experiment and see what suits you best. Its up to you to find the best balance.. Personally it doesnt really matter if its a weekend or not the hard part for me are social events. I try to arrange my fasts around any group meetings and IF eating windows during them. Not always possible but I do my best. Once again for me its all about the balance.. Tips on how to get through the weekend while sticking with IF dont be too worried about productivityhappiness try it out it will probably be better than you expect. Even during longer fasts h many people me included feel better not worse.

According to Dr. Fung who specializes in Fasting Health your body uses max g of protein from muscle per week of fasting. If you were to fast for  weeks thats g which is very easy to put back on in  days. Ketones aka fatty acids aka......fat are used for energy  of the time.

9272418,0,t3_57a4e8,Dr. Fung talks about this in his recent interview with Mercola.If you havent fasted before or been on a ketogenic diet your body may not be adapted to burning fat for fuel. As you become adapted your cells develop more mitochondria within each cell. Mitochondria are the powerplants of the cells. They convert fuel into power. It may take  weeks to a month for a person to sufficiently increase their mitochondria such that they feel good burning fat instead of sugar. Fasting seems to speed up the process. Being insulinresistant seems to slow down the process per Fung.Mercola gave an anecdote where having a fat shake tea coconut oil butter and stevia helped one person feel much better during their fast and kept them in ketosis.I dont know how pure you want to keep your fast but if youre inclined to loosen up in order to continue it instead of stopping maybe try a cup of bullet proof coffee.For me I like salt  and a good bit of it.,fasting,d8rcgd2,2,t5_2s9dh

10623302,0,t3_5s0gpa,That actually happens to me too when I eat too many carbs. Weird right? This is one of the reasons why I prefer lower carb diets. Maybe some people are just more genetically sensitive to carbs even without diabetes or prediabetes. Actually one of the weirder things is that ever since I started doing keto and fasting fairly regularly Ive been able to tolerate large amounts of carbs better as long as I dont eat like that for more than two days. Maybe because the carbs mostly go towards restocking my muscle glycogen?However I DO still get dizzy if I eat carbs immediately after a fast so I usually keep my fastbreaking meals really low carb.

I believe that means ltmg per dose whereas many OTC tables here have mg !. that dose will stay in your system until the next morning acting like a sleeping pill. it basically means youre effectively getting half of your sleeping pill when you want to wake up  not good.ive taken a mg dose and slept for  hours straight. couldnt sleep at all the next night. definitely would not recommend that high a dose.,fasting,ddrmmxw,1,t5_2s9dh

11209658,0,t1_df2l5q0,Nobody is telling you to fast for  days. Some people fast for  hours some for a week some try a month. When you begin creating ketones and the fake hungry feeling leaves after the third day or so of water fasting you will likely have more energy than ever before. Fasting does not mean you are going to feel tired and bogged down as popular culture has suggested. Learn the science and frankly spectacular benefits of water fasting and then make an educated decision on what you think of it all. People that speak about fasting who havent fasted themselves are not reliable sources. Same goes for doctors that have no personal experience. Jason Fung has had hundreds of patients and has the data to back up what is actually happening during extended fasting periods.As for Ghandi. Well he was already a fairly lanky fellow and was a large advocate for the fast. If anyone that low in body fat decides to fast for too long they will eventually reap negative benefits when they deplete their fat and begin metabolizing protein.I have more energy today third day of fast than I had riding bikes  miles a day as a teenager with my best friends.

11702108,0,t1_dgm1z0t,I presume you mean autophagy so if you mean something else this wont apply...The turnover rate in cutaneous tissue is very high but they tend to be produced and shoved out with little modification. Scar tissue does indeed improve over time but Im not aware of any evidence of autophagy applying to existing scar tissue.Autophagy generally refers to the process of breaking down old proteins the cellular machinery within our cells. The extracellular matrix which makes up much of the connective scar tissue is much tougher and not subject to the intercellular autophagous process.Fasting may help reduce scarring but it wont be to a large degree.
