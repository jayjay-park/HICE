11516133,0,t3_6045v1,Hi! Im one of the cocreators of the Musician Match. Weve been hosting a monthly event at Art Works and so far have had over  people participate. The energy enthusiasm and positive feedback has been great. Weve had a diverse mix of instruments interests and skill levels. From pro players currently in bands to folks who have never jammed with others  and everyone in between. Its amazing to see folks get right into making music only a few minutes after meeting. Magic! Right now were planning our next event and will soon post details to mysongx.com  let me know if you have any specific questions. Happy to answer. ,rva_events,dg1cson,1,t5_32k7y
