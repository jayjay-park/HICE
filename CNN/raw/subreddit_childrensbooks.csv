859619,0,t3_23ylsx,I really like this post as I myself struggle with my own creative desires musical mostly vs financial need and a familys demands.Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to make big bank at a questionable job in order to underwrite the work I care about.

1208835,0,t3_27v4t6,Im going to assume from the content of the story that you were aiming at secular nontheistnonspiritualist families instead of as you stated nonsecular spiritualisttheist families. If Im wrong what Im saying wont make sense. I love the direction that youre going and I think there is a need for this kind of thing. I struggled with explaining these things to my kid. Here is a post I made at the time. My wife and I are atheist and did not want to lie or tell religious stories as if they were true. I told her about how we came from the earth and trees etc. and thats where we go back to when our body dies but she wouldnt accept that the stuff she was made up of going into the eco system would still be her. I wouldnt tell her or hint that her consciousness would continue after her body died. I see that as the same deceit as religion. I really appreciate what youre doing so Im not going to hold back. Here is my unrestrained response to the content of your book. gtWhen our star was born it made the moon and the planets and the earth.Technically our star did not make the moon and planets it captured them in its gravity. Though its all star stuff. It is necessary to be simple but you should also be accurate. gtIn fact all of the animals in the world today changed over time from being dinosaurs to the animals we see today including you and me.Not all the animals we see today came from dinosaurs. Most of them came from creatures that lived alongside dinosaurs though. It is probably true of birds however. Dinosaurs did not evolve into humans!gtWhen people die they become the earth and the trees and the sky.In what way do they become the sky? Also it is peoples bodies that become the earth and trees. Theres no evidence that our consciousness remains in any form. To say people become these things may easily be interpreted as their consciousness joining those things too. gtShe is in the stars?The only interpretation that I can work out of this that makes sense would be that the entire known universe is the realm of stars including Earth. This is assuming that she is the remains of her body. Otherwise it would suggest like religion that she is out there. Either way it makes it very easy to interpret that there is life after death a spiritualist model. Dont get me wrong. I really like where youre going. I like the discussion and the childs questions. I just found the answers to be inconsistent with the overall theme. I think of you clean that up you could have the makings of a nice book. ,childrensbooks,ci5m1rn,2,t5_2ryh7
