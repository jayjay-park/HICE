He whines about zombie accounts but utters not a peep about the SPAs and zombie accounts that are on his WPFACTION.You write I believe you are an asset to the encyclopaedia. This was formerly true.You persist in believing that the people who regularly libel software developers who have done no wrong are not misogynists. I wish you the joy of the company you prefer. Everyone knows how to reach me if Im wanted. A project or really a boys club which punishes editors for defending the good names and reputations of living people from vicious internet trolls does not deserve to survive and is unlikely to. MarkBernstein talk   March  UTCThe problem is precisely that you are not defending the good names and reputations of living people from vicious internet trolls you are repeatedly and gratuitously attacking editors in good standing and anybody who doesnt absolutely agree with younow including me it seems. Ive lost count of the number of times youve been asked to stop and yet you refer to your opponents as the armies of Mordor during an enforcement request about precisely that sort of comment. What misogyny and trolling there is is being controlled it is simply disingenuous to suggest that its rife and certainly what goes on here pales in comparison to most of the rest of the Internet and we put significant effort into dealing with it. This is not about trolling this is about your inability to engage in goodfaith discussion without attacking your opponents. HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?   March  UTCI know of two possibly three posted statements that were both libelous and disgusting within the past week. I dont doubt there were more. Thats a fairly mild week as you well know. The previous week one of those lasted for many hours. The term Armies Of Mordor was coined by Prof. David Millard as you know and is selfevidently satirical. As for the control of misogyny howre you doing with this weeks plan to purge the page of the term  launched by a zombie account again  words long again raised anew every two weeks by your good faith goons who always just happen to have a fresh zombie to kick things off and with which you havent dirtied your hands again.These are not goodfaith discussions they are a sham. As unfortunately is Wikipedia.No need to reply here. Wikipedians seem to think that everyone reads these backalley pages but they dont its a fantasy treasured by little boys of various sizes in their basements the world over. You may think the rest of the internet is worse but this pile of garbage is your patch HJ and where you should be cleaning it youre making things a good deal worse while failing to protect the victims against whom your allies are wielding this project. MarkBernstein talk   March  UTCAsking questions is not disruptive. It takes more than one editor to get a discussion going round in circles and if others disengaged and ignored there wouldnt be a problem Assuming there is one to start with. More to the point thats not even close to misogynistic trolling. There were some very unpleasant edits to Brianna Wus article the other day and they were reverted within minutes oversighted shortly after and I fully protected the article as soon as I got to my computer. When something nasty happens it gets dealt with. The rest is not going to be won by calling your opponents names. HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?   March  UTC,WikiInAction,cpmdxsk,9,t5_3596i

4007157,0,t3_36bwop,I remember Lightbreather as the editor behind the wikimedia proposal for a safe space only for women that for some reason needed grant money those not familiar with this have fun reading the lengthy discussion page linked from that thread that contains all of the opposition comments.  She did a lot of selective canvassing to try to get it passed.From what I have gathered from skimming this case so far Lightbreather is a part of the Gender Gap Task Force.  For those not aware there was an ArbCom case concerning misconduct with the task force several months ago around the same time as GG and apparently Lightbreather retired just as it started and then unretired right after it ended and it has been pointed out that she evaded punishment that she should be taken to ArbCom for.Another familiar face SlimVirgin has canvassed the Gender Gap Task Force to the case.This is something I just found funny from the evidence.  She broke her elbow and accused an editor of warring with her specifically at a time she was at a disadvantage  Then didnt get the right answer so she pinged and canvassed some SJW admins who would be on her side.  She does this a lot actually.  After a long period of stalkingwarring with an editor and several times saying he doesnt respect women going as far as to join the WikiProject he is most active in Pornography after previously accusing him having no respect for women BECAUSE he edits porn articles.  She took him to ANI and pinged  specific admins hoping theyd resolve the case in her favor.Tried to turn the WikiProject for editor retention into basically another gender gap task forceShe is currently party to  interaction bans with other editors.

4023339,0,t1_crdkwev,Ill respond to you if nobody else will.This post remains up because it breaks no rules.  The article linked by this post in particular is the highest profile incident of this happening on Wikipedia and is a main battleground that people on the site fight over on how people should be represented if they are trans.  On many other articles about trans people this article is frequently cited as a precedent to follow.Personally I see no issue with an article describing a person by the gender and name that they identify as and if the reliable sources identify them as such.  As I said this is an article on a very high profile individual who came out as trans and therefore there is a BOAT LOAD of coverage about that enough to warrant significant inclusion in the article.  It is not surprisingly at all that people who are both fervent advocates of trans rights and those opposed to it for various reasons have turned it into a battleground.  This is also a high profile article for political reasons and people have plenty of reason to smear them as well.,WikiInAction,crew2zj,8,t5_3596i

Little would have changed in the outcome if WiA had deleted those posts immediately. Stukalied or other members may or may not post at the Kiwi Farms.

8241383,0,t1_d55ltn2,Oh hello there thekohser. In  I came across your article on Russavias outing by an editor of military history articles Charles Ainsworth who in turn got blocked for this and unblocked by an admin which led to his desysopping. I admired this because I now know Wikipedia has been taken over by trolls and its scope of influence now covers the entire Internet.Worse still there are bits of Russian influence in the Wikipedia community many of them including myself are secret puppets of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Kremlin. Were being used to destroy the West all along.Also there are Wikipedians who praised and supported US Republican candidate for president Donald Trump. For example Erik Moeller a controversial highlevel Wikipedia manager well known for his pedophiliadefending views might have backed or endorsed him. And there are  or  if counting Stemoc known Wikipedians for Trump. However given Trumps statement that he has secret supporters there could be more than  or  which may include BatteryIncluded who I think called Trump very talented colorful bright and honest person he ever comes across and administrators such as Boing! said Zebedee AGK and Dennis Brown.Wikipedias love for Donald Trump is not the only thing youve concerned. There is growing love admiration and praise for Vladimir Putin as well among the Wikipedia community. The editors and administrators noted Putins ruthlessness in enforcing the rules in not only Wikipedia but also the entire Internet.And also some of Trumps policies turning off Americas tech industry and his proposed Internet ban may benefit Wikipedia because theyre constant under attacks from critics whom they called trolls vandals disruptive and tendentious people.In summary Wikipedia may have played a significant role in shaping Donald Trumps rise to the US presidential candidancy in its fifteen years along with Putin himself. The folks at Wikipedia do not wish to see his bid derailed or lost I think and pave the way for Trumputin mafia given that the WP communitys tendency to act like a mob.Thekohser I hope you take note of this.,WikiInAction,d57q8nu,1,t5_3596i

8692343,0,t1_d6s2rbt,I have to disagree with games being just pixels. In a lot of ways theyre the same kind of thing as books and movies.  In America popular culture takes up a lot of our time.  If you grow up or as an adult merely get used to seeing women or minorities or anyone portrayed in an unhealthy way youll end up feeling like thats normal yes even if your parents have given you the its fiction talk.  Toxic masculinity youre a failure as a man unless youre everything on this checklist objectification of women racial and ethnic stereotypes they all matter.I think its that games still get a lot less attention than movies and they used to get even less.  If the female characters in a movie are clearly solely there for sexual fantasies the whole country notices and a lot of people object.  Now games are getting more of that kind of attention than they used to.The Star Trek DS episode Far Beyond the Stars covered this idea a long time before the shift in gaming journalism.  The eps set in the s among a group of scifi writers.  It starts with the one woman and one black writer being told not to show up for the company photo that will appear in their magazine so that the readers wont know theyre not white guys.  The big turning point is when one of the black writers younger friends is shot by police while committing a minor crime.  Hed been convinced there were no good straight jobs for black men even though he was personally acquainted with the black writer because he just wasnt used to seeing black men as artists or professionals.  Hed internalized the message that hed been shown over and over in the media and it had drowned out what hed seen with his own eyes and heard in real life from another person.,WikiInAction,d6s677n,4,t5_3596i

He hopes that the ban of computers by Trump will solve mental health problems I presume.Bear in mind BatteryIncluded and other people on Wikipedia including administrators have openly praised and admired Russian President Vladimir Putin who from the start may have a hand in playing them pawns. Putin is a thug and should not interfere in Internet affairs since the President calls the Internet a CIA project whom he hates except for his own website and his community.If Putin launches a Russian version of Wikipedia BatteryIncluded Dennis Brown AGK and Boing! said Zebedee will migrate to that project.If BatteryIncluded and his Wikipedia community on one side and Putin on another side met I knew it for sure. It is Vladimir Putin whos using and playing with me all along. He used Russavia in . He used all of us. And now hes smiling at me every time I got banned in    from Wikipedia after an absurd PhobosGrunt episode in which Putins corruption may have been the cause from ED from OhInternet from Bleeping Computer and from Know Your Meme to name a few. I wish he will not get away with it since my bans are examples of evil trumps good.You should know that. Altright is supporting Russia and it is racist.

If I had to guess DoRD stumbled on the socks which he blocked and then saw a possible connection to Ricky but wisely decided to verify with other CUs and defer to ArbCom for desysopping instead of publicizing and acting upon the initial result by himself which explains the  months delay while ArbCom checked and doublechecked and discussed the situation.People often shit on private backroom investigations like this but I prefer this and then public confirmation once the result is certain... instead of public discussion of initial results that may turn out to be mistaken and cause a lot of drama and unwarranted trouble for the accused.,WikiInAction,d8f8nqp,9,t5_3596i

If youre not having fun let me know and Ill wind down instead of up.A honest thank you for saying that! Makes me more relaxed. gtAnd this one gives largely male definitions. By your reasoning dont you think these others might have been using the malespecific meaning?Thats certainly possible. They might have been. If we cant figure it out by context probably the only way is to ask. It could also be that the term itself was intended as generic but the creator intended them to be male anyway. Its just a case of we dont know and the whole discussion while still interesting is probably a little pointless in the end. Now for me when I read a grammatically male term I dont make any assumptions on the natural sex of the person described. Its how I grew up. And might be influenced by my native language where men can  or even have to  be called she depending on the sentence women he and a sentence like she impregnated him can make perfect sense she being male and he being female. A generic understanding of grammar is still common but probably on the way out. I think its a little sad because I like not having to consider someones genitals before I talk toabout them...edit  Given the question of inclusivityability to identify Id have no problem to think the characters are not male as long as there is definitive prove that they can only be identified as male.
