2435981,0,t1_cmcogrs,Laveener here ... I seem to recall that the GRIC was originally onboard with the highway going over the land but something happened in the late eighties or early nineties that essentially pissed them off again at the white man and have ever since been opposed to the freeway really just to be dicks. The wife and I moved to Laveen over  years ago because of the promise of the freeway going in .... Obviously were still waiting.It seems like this is the closest that weve ever been to getting the freeway built but I will believe when I drive on it. There a numerous dark forces in Ahwatukee aligned against having the freeway built. It has nothing to do with the handful of houses that might have to be razed and more to do with the fact that those pricks dont want our kind shopping at their Trader Joes. Before we moved to Laveen we lived in Ahwatukee and while we made many good friends there the overall community snobbish bordering on pure dickishness. While Laveen has a ghetto problem it also has a wonderful sense of community. It has a very Mayberryish smalltown charm yet were only  minutes from downtown. BTW The portion of South Mountain that will have to cut into to avoid Indian land amounts to small hill at the very western tip of the preserve. Also the Indian are plain stupid They just built an entirely new casino right there on their sacred land and because they opposed the highway there wont be an exit for the casino which of course would have brought them a lot more business.,phoenix,cmcsk6f,-7,t5_2qmpu

SRP wants to put the cost of power generation in with the grid cost though they consider the power plants part of the grid.  Solar customer will pay for their own solar and they are more than fine with removing the subsidies so long as the subsidies for oil and gas are removed as well. You sound like an SRP shill making the same baseless half truth arguments.

Any time you need to stop you stop. You step to the back or side of the room catch your breath grab some water and come back in whenever youre ready.I remember once stepping out there have been many times but this one time in particular... took about  minutes caught my breath came back in and the instructor yelled Way to get back in there Charlie. Theyll never give you shit for stepping out but will always give you credit for getting back in. Theres no ego. The best most experienced students will slow down to work with you and encourage you. A friend of mine who weighs over lbs started recently. He didnt make it through the warmup without needing to step out and catch his breath. That was fine. He even wrote on Facebook that he was getting looks but not looks of judgement but looks of yeah been there... we know how it feels. I understand being hesitant. Best thing I can tell you to do is come in and talk to the head instructors Michael or Tony. Explain your concerns to them facetoface and see what they say. Better than from some random guy on the internet  They have free trial classes as well so really my suggestion would be come by talk to Mike or Tony take a trial class and see what you think.Again feel free to ask any questions either here or via PM.,phoenix,cuu6ibe,2,t5_2qmpu

There is a pretty hip bowling alley downtown if you can get there called the lucky strike. It even has an arcade and restaurantbar attached. They may have age restrictions though at certain times so call ahead. If you are a smooth operator I would suggest grabbing coffee at a local coffee shop or mall.

5796045,0,t1_cxf7u1q,A lot of that just isnt true.  First Portland wasnt planned around transit.  What do you know of Portlands history?  Did you know it was  cities merged together Portland East Portland and Albina.  Hence the quadrant system for street addresses.As for Phoenix there was a plan called Val Trans.  It was put to a vote and lost a fairly close race.  That was  or .  Phoenix also had streetcars before the s like every decent sized city in the US.  Bus highway interests and the proliferation of suburbs killed them all off.  Like I said give PHX some time.  Not only is transit expanding per the regional transportation plan that details everything but politically the population is becoming more interested in transit investment.Portland really isnt the panacea of transit anyway.  The UGB has helped keep density and ridership up but its also making anything west of nd and north of Milwaukee too expensive for most people.  Its becoming Disneyland for wealthy hipsters and the retired.,phoenix,cxfjycs,1,t5_2qmpu

5877172,1,t3_3vpg0d,Near  year resident here Ill give it to you straightif youre young and looking for a place for young people phoenix is absolutely NOT your place. I know young people who move here and their friends ask why? like are you retiring? Why in the world would anyone under  move to phoenix? Are you going to raise a family? No? Then stay the hell away from phoenix. Nothing going on that pretty much describes phoenix. Is it better than redneckville SC? I dont know probably. Are there MUCH better places to live on the westcoast? Absolutely. Literally anywhere west of here ok maybe not reno will be MUCH better than phoenix. If you find something to do in Phoenix other than go to bars let me know. Theres no good food in phoenix compared to most other big cities. I mean sure theres a few select restaurants youll go to but compared to other big cities phoenix ranks pretty much at the bottom. I would highly advise almost any other city out west. Denver Seattle Portland San FranDiego hell even LA. Ive met MANY people who have moved here from other states and during the honeymoon period they absolutely love it. Then about  years go by and theyre done. Once again phoenix is NOT a place for young people. Downtown is a joke. Scottsdale is a joke unless youre into blonde cougars and Tempe is all college kids which is fine if thats what you want but also high crime. Again if youre not coming to phoenix to retire why are you coming here? Stop and ask yourself what is attractive about phoenix? I can not on good faith offer a positive overall review of phoenix. People live in phoenix and say but look how close we are to california! or were only  hours from vegas!  everything people in phoenix want to do is NOT in phoenix. Pros  months of good weather per yearlow housing costs NOT low rentuhhh... Im stuck thats all I got. Cons lots and lots of old people and familieslots of redneck conservatives who think theyre cowboys living in the wild west lest we not forget this IS a deep red stateyou will absolutely need a car anywhere you gopoor food optionssheriff joe no awesome breweries ok theres like  maybe  but cmonthe heat. during juneoctober you will not be leaving your house while the sun is still up. trust me on this one. edit  Im laughing because reading through all the other comments here EXACTLY confirmed what I just said. Multiple people saying how close we are to OTHER places or that all there is to do is tempescottsdale drinking and literally no one has mentioned anything awesome about phoenix. OP are you starting a family and buying a house in phoenix? Yes? then sure phoenix is for you. No? then stay far far away. ,phoenix,cxq128j,-1,t5_2qmpu

6945810,0,t3_4au7li,Ive lived in Central Phoenix my whole life and the Roosevelt neighborhood downtown for the past  years and I think what is happening downtown is great.  Just  years ago downtown was scary place filled with homeless people and abandoned buildings  the only reason anyone ever visited was for a Suns game or work in the govt area. Now we have dozens of local galleries coffee shops restaurants bars boutiques salons  places that I can walk to at night and feel safe! I think that ASU has played a large part in gentrifying downtown  bringing in younger people who want to be able to live in an area where there are fun things to do. First Friday has also become quite the event with making Roosevelt the epicenter for arts. But youre right  its getting crazy expensive.  I just read an article about new sf apartments downtown costing month or something ridiculous.  The only way that I could afford to buy a house in my neighborhood is if my salary doubled. How to solve this? I dont know.  You could make x of all new apartments to be available for a lower income level. Its just what happens when you have a limited supply but lots of demand. ,phoenix,d13mz88,3,t5_2qmpu

Talk about airplane noise we were directly in the flight path they are probably a few hundred feet if not lower by that point. Then add in the trains. It actually becomes peaceful in a way. I imagine not everybody feels this way though and I would guess that value is affected. My bigger concern would probably be a crash though I admit that I dont even know the flight path right now. I also admit that it isnt likely but you see more small plane crashes from these smaller airports not so much the big ones. I assume they might land from the north heading south based off the direction Ive seen them heading from my location. Id guess landing in that direction is better than taking off in that direction if youre buying a house in that neighborhood. I also hear and see them right over my head a lot so I understand I am probably at a similar minute risk from my current location.Totally agree again on the north and east Mesa stuff.

11015205,0,t1_deghpan,McDowell is definitely smooth. Not a ton of climbing and the climbs you do find are long and gradual. Most of the trails off Pemberton are hardpack sand. Browns is similar except there are  turns every  ft. on a lot of trails. Lame. The race loops are OK at McDowell but Browns has more fun stuff toward the back of the park. Anything north of El Diablo loop is pretty fun with smaller climbs and no tech.South Mountain runs the gamut from ultra technical to standard issue XC. The big climbs are very big often steep and can be technical but they are much more rewarding. A good loop that is a bit tamer is start at th St.Beverly Canyon Trailhead. Beverly Canyon up to the fireroad over the ridge fun chunky up and down Desert Classic out and back Beverly Canyon back up to the fireroad fireroad to Javelina Javelina back to the Beverly Canyon Trailhead. Lots of texture to keep you entertained the whole time without the higher consequence of National. Dreamy DrawTrail  is also fun. Good climbs good XC and lots of solid tech if you know where to look. Right through the middle of the city. Youll never see the city from McDowell because the park is behind the McDowell Mountains.

I would like to avoid them like plague.Edit The article defines intervention as anything that would produce a bad experience for the passenger such as sudden braking or acceleration. On the other hand critical intervention which is defined as ones that would result in damage like turning into incoming traffic is still high at once every  miles.Edit I know these cars always have people in them hence the human intervention part.

Your undergarments should not be tight at the leg creases where your leg meets the pubic area. Meaning no tighty whiteys. Also no Marky Mark Calvins. Sticky to all cotton fabric for awhile. Think breathable. . Chamois cream is not just for cyclists. Invest in some. Youll thank me later. Forgot the damn link .  Use AampD ointment to clear up the itchy rash you have now before you start using any other creams or chamois creams. .  Wash your hands thoroughly after each visit to the bathroom.

11396110,0,t1_dfnlzb6,When it comes to public schools there is no broad brush that can be painted with.If its an title public school though so for example Urban  Poor those kids are going to respect real and direct. Even as early as middle school. Its  and everyone has a cell phone and they can find anything to support their viewpoint. You need to be concrete and direct subtly is not your friend.However with this being said these kids THIRST for actual meaningful education it just must be presented with someone theyve established trust with. Sadly I do not think the resource problem is physical its philosophical. Education should be budget friendly but not become ruled by it. Schools need LOWER Student to teacher ratios. Ive taught where its  kids in ONE classroom. It is not realistic to put  people on an some there unwillingly island and not expect many issues to occur.Its really the philosophy that every child WILL be the BEST and NO child will FAIL EVER. Unfortunately this doesnt reflect life. Life is about choices and you can choose to pass just as you choose to fail. Everyone has a different set of obstacles and we try to make a lot of superficial work instead of encouraging what needs to happen we need to give students NOT their parents more choice in their education. We need to be facilitating more shadowingonthejob training skills than test staking skills for a standardized highstakes test. We need to allow students to better explore career options in high schools and build paths for students to actually experience what that career is like more than just a romanticized day of Im talking about the hard stuff. Explain the idea of life balance better do you want to be a doctor knowing that you may be on call  for a portion of your career? Are you really going to want to get up at  am and go to bed at  pm to change your lifestyle to suit that culinary baking dream?? Public schools do need some things that could immediately change the face of any school PARENT AND COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER HELPINVOLVEMENT. I know this is not the most fun thing in the world to do but can you referee a tball game or coach a cheerleading squad? At one school I worked with the Track teacher had to google to show the kids technique as he selfadmitted to me he was clueless otherwise sincerely I didnt judge if we  wouldnt have tried there would be no track team. I myself got wrapped in coaching or supervising some things I was clearly not qualified for at the time. I got lucky once or twice and had an enthusedtalented parent that could properly assistant coach  meaning that they were the actual coach and I was just the motivational piece.  FUNDRAISING Anything you can do to help raise PRIVATE funds to finance the school it will be better.For example In Nazareth PA the school district there has pretty much amazing everything yet they get the same money from the state as most schools do. Mario Andrettes former Formula Racer wife is a former Nazareth native and thats why he sinks the money in there her involvement I suppose. Now can all schools get a race car driver to donate regularly? No lol thats ridiculous. However what about local businesses who arent using their money to donate to local schools in favor of tax deductions? If the local shops would do this it would solve quite a few problems in my personal opinion. One school in particular was so amazing they wanted to get high school students CompTIA and CISCO certified FOR FREE but we couldnt get ANYONE to help fund us and all we needed was  to finish out the year for those kids and possibly have a chance at turning a profit I just reread this and this is exactly what I mean our school HINGED on making money not on being sustainable in our rd year. The only investor we had was some large local org who wanted the ability and connections but not the kids or the teachers . It really is a heartbreaking story.  Meaningful and REALISTIC goals set WITH students Yeah the state wants all the kids to score high on the localized test so they can show progress but what about what the kids want? Whats in it for them? I once had a very talented student who was a great artist I say this with love and respect she was not a good student in the traditional sense she was a very abstract thinker she aspired to be a tattoo artisthairdresser and at one career night many teachers jumped this poor girl and began telling her that her dream was the worst thing ever and she should go to college instead. This really damaged so much with that student after that night I saw a change and she confessed what happened to me as I had witnessed it. Whats wrong if that is what she wants to do AND she has the ability to do it? No it may not be the most conventional career and a sophomore in high school may not absolutely mean what they are saying here but imagine having your dreams crushed by those who she trusted? Let kids explore their dreams and goals even up until senior year its better to go through  trades and find the one you love then all in on an unknown college goal for a job that you may or may not enjoy. Im not sure I answered your question but its mostly less politics more community involvement and more engagement and empowering students outside of academia.

As you pointed out the climate has always been changing. The issue is that the global temperatures and concentrations of certain gases and particles have never changed this fast. Source gt Was it people in huts burning firewood that started global warming?Some people think human activity might have played a role but I think its misrepresentative to say that from  human fossil fuel activity is akin to people in huts burning firewood.gt Besides a warmer planet has tremendous health benefitsIt also has tremendous problems and it definitely could be argued that the problems outweigh the benefits. A rising sea level could displace hundreds of millions around the world and could create worldwide migrantrefugee crises of coastal dwellers moving inland.gt When propoganda doesnt match the model predictions you just make excuses so Im not expecting an honest answer from you. You bought into the scare and you feel at faultgt ...gt I admit the science has been excessively wrong and can see that their tax policies are nothing more than an opportunists launch for a power and money grab.I dont deny that there is a lot of unnecessary propaganda misinformation and ridiculous fearmongering around this issue and it pisses me off too.
