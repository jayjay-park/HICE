4736897,0,t1_ctrml1b,Well if thats you plan then go with it.I do not appreciate and will not stand for petty claims thrown against MoralLesson with no foundation and with a goal to destroy his reputation. So unless you have any proof of wrong doing stop posting assumptions.,LiberationNews,ctrmntm,1,t5_380f0
