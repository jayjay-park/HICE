2653953,0,t3_2qcile,The only two TFC packs I know of are both on the ftb launcher called TerraFirmaPunk and TechnoFirmacraft which both feature a tech mod or two along with tfc. TFP seems like a better pack but I havent used it. I played with TechnoFirma and was kinda unimpressed an had to quit after a week due to world corruption. And lastly there are some light modpacks for servers on the TFC forums a particular one Ive played was Vividcraft. It had a map and an NPC mod and thats about it ,ModdedMC,cn502e4,2,t5_2us1j

7520531,0,t3_4ibbtp,. Icapi was causing errors near the beginning try running without ic and see what happens. Or see if it has an update available.. It clearly says enderio doesnt work well with optifine so after you try without ic or update it try without optifine. . If neither of those work remove enderio and see what happens. I hope those help. ,ModdedMC,d2x1pyc,1,t5_2us1j
