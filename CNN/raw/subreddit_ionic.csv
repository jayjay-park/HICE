6237058,0,t3_40z5vt,Local database access?  Ive done some iOS work with SQLite but am curious about what ionic has to offer in local data storage. ,ionic,cyyl3o3,1,t5_320ze
7671721,0,t3_4iw443,   I will try a couple free tutorials firstif you provide if I really made something out of it. I will by  month one to learn all tutorials in one month.Since most of learning is always by self.    Actually I am learning Ionic with Typescript now and I am encounter wield problems though. I followed exactly the api to use NavController but it never works as it suppose to I have no idea why.Hope there are some tutorial can really lead me through,ionic,d3e8anu,1,t5_320ze
7702982,0,t1_d3hqfe0,Some good points there. I think Im going to take a gamble and go for V. I made a start today. It is quite a different development experience. Especially the stacktrace you get on an error. It almost had a java feel about it.,ionic,d3hs0dd,1,t5_320ze
7847396,0,t3_4msz01,Oh btw an example of the JSON data incl the Arabic can be found here ,ionic,d3y47cy,1,t5_320ze

8252146,0,t1_d58x35q,Gotta validate the receipts on a server.  ,ionic,d592o8l,2,t5_320ze
8287252,0,t1_d5demqi,But we can host by ourself with open source Parse server. I think it is still a good choice to use,ionic,d5dgriy,2,t5_320ze
8760971,0,t3_4zdxyi,when you say alertnotification do you actually mean like a notification that will come up even if your app is not running in the foreground? or do you just mean like an actionsheet or modal or popover or something along those lines?,ionic,d70s672,1,t5_320ze

11230610,0,t1_df48sjc,Thanks for taking the time and yes it appears there is a long and challenging road ahead. I think Im up for giving it a shot but there are some benchmark questions that I havent found much information on. For instance how many hours did it take you to learn each of the languages proficiently? How many hours until your first app? Did you major in CS? I did not majored in Accounting and Im curious as to how much of a disadvantage that may be. In regards to the selftaught route and resources is there a triedandtrue path here? The link I posted above was found off of a basic google search. Should I simply use the resources that it refers me to or are there better alternatives? What resources did you learn from?  While building a mobile app is the ultimate goal Im nonetheless very interested in learning programming. If Im capable of learning languages such as Java or C that companies are looking for that would be great as well. ,ionic,df4z3kt,1,t5_320ze
