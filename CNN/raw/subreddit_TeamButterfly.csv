8582697,0,t1_d6eed8p,Its super simple. Get a couple of the McCormick grill mates jars of rub. I like the Apple wood and the sweet and smoky. You can blend them or do them separately since tenderloin usually comes in  packs... at least around here. Add a little kosher salt and garlic powder. Hubs says you should let them sit out and get to room temperature before you coat them in rub. Then youll need to smoke them with wood chips and charcoal dont ask me how Im not initiated into the secrets of pork smoking giggle. Use a meat thermometer to check them and when they reach the appropriate temp bathe them liberally in your choice of BBQ sauce and keep on the heat just long enough to make the sauce get gooey and sticky. Allow to rest gently wrapped in foil for at least  minutes easily the hardest and one of the most important steps. Then try not to eat them all in one sitting lol,TeamButterfly,d6ef8c1,2,t5_3f9lf
