I would admit to one or two very recent drinks rather than the handle you drank the night before as they both smell the same pretty much.This is coming from someone who doesnt drink much any more.  I was a lush in college and married a fun guy. I thought he had to be ready to settle down in his s? Nope  yrs ago I had to make him choose between going to the bar every night and passing out nightly after driving his drunk ass home only  DUI or keeping his wife amp daughter.  He picked the booze.Im over it pretty much but still worry about him.  He just now swang by to get his daughter and his nose was CHERRY red.  He was shaking bad.  Didnt say anything but I am upset hes going down hill.  What can I do? Its the life he chose. He doesnt have daughter overnightsI am looking for that powder stuff you guys take and its subreddit. It may be the only thing he might take.  Hes functional but apparently running out if steam in that area. Yeah I am still enabling whatever.,cripplingalcoholism,cga4clf,1,t5_2s68b

However there are choices between being sober and drinking alone.    It still sounds like a bit of a struggle between what you want to do and what you think you should do. Dont worry we have all been there and go there from time to time still even if we have accepted our lifestyle.    It will sound trite but you might try pacing or measuring out your drinks. I find that when I measure my drinks  i.e. . oz per glass I tend to drink less than if I free pour  I have a pretty good idea where Im at throughout the day rather than suddenly finding the whole fucking bottle is gone.

Be friendly most people are old hippies who did that back in the ss and not creepy horror movie types. They just want to converse and talk about the good old days. A lot of times people will drop you off at a fast food joint and buy you a couple cheap items.Beyond that its up to you. He loved it and after he left town he would call me every couple days from another state and eventually settled somewhere.A few tips he shared Bandanas with an american flag on them or any other american flag clothing. Throw your thumb up with a big old smile and jump around dont look solemn and dreary even if youre tired because most people wont bother. Dumpster diving is a great way for a free meal grocery stores and Little Ceasers are great they toss out old hot n readys all the time. He also begged held a sign up and shit for a few bucks for food and booze.

1463178,0,t3_2ax7z2,There is the good advice of the taper guide in the sidebar.  However sometimes you have to do a quick and dirty taper due to circumstance like money or time.    Last Friday after a couple week bender I cut it down to about a mickey a day still completely fucked the next about half a mickey and it was hellacious. Sunday I bought another mickey equivalent and I kept it to one . oz shot equivalent every  hours. It didnt stop the sweats or the shaking or the heartracing or the mental stuff  but it would slow it down for a bit. I did that for the next  days and it got a bit better near the end.    For a hard taper there is no way to avoid withdrawal symptoms. What you are trying to do is keep those withdrawal symptoms within the bounds where you are not jumping out of windows or running to the ER.  It will not be fun but it is doable and many people here have had to do it.    Best of luck.  It does take some will power but it can be done.  No gain without pain.,cripplingalcoholism,cizooek,1,t5_2s68b

So i did and then we started playing beer pong. When I missed a cup I punched a hole in my wall. Then I was trying to move my mothers china cabinet to cover up the hole. Problem was that its a two part china cabinet so instead of moving the entire thing I just pushed the top part off of the bottom part and wrecked everything. Best part is my friend was on vine for some reason and got it on video. Next thing I knew im waking up to my mother screaming at me to get out. I got kicked out of my house that day and was homeless for a while. I also found out that my friends had cleaned up the entire house for me. What annoys me the most is that apparently my friend tried to tell me to do something and I slapped him in the face.

1701040,0,t3_2duz75,I just read a series of articles from HAMS  The Harm Reduction Site  This link It might be worth your while to read through them.  They reference a number of studies which show the harmful effects of confrontational rehab and the whole fallacy of the step method.    There are quite a few articles.  However you might be able to find quite a few that could bolster your case against going.  Give you some ammunition against your family.    Personally I think it is a hurtful idea rather than a helpful one. I see no benefit in disrupting your life merely to follow some popular culture trope that insists that rehab and total abstinence are the only solutions to those of us who drink or have drunk heavily.    I know it will be a bit of a slog but most of the articles are short and they have links to all the reference papers that they cite.    There is a sign in my therapists office which reads Therapy is for those who want it not those who need it.  Going to therapy when you dont want to and are hostile to it is in my mind a complete waste of time and money.  ,cripplingalcoholism,cjtku5n,3,t5_2s68b

Look at it in your head drunk or sober. Then write it out as clearly you have that gift. Then reach for it each day even in baby steps. Read it each day. Reading between the lines you are a caring person who still has friendships you care about.

Maybe do the genderswapped equivalent?

Wipe that person clean from my memory but not until Ive finished a good long period of self loathing and remorse.I dont advise either of these actions.

I am a footnote a sentence in parentheses an item just barely remembered when it was almost too late. I have forgotten myself. I love too much. I give myself away and dont think twice. When Im alone its like I am vapor just barely hanging on to human form. When Im alone my heart skips beats stasis is my form of living. Being alive..... What does that mean? It cant be breathing blood pumping through veins the heart doing its thing. My heart beats only in tandem. I breathe in plural. This isnt fun it isnt fair I didnt want this. My heart is trying to kill me going against my wishes just to prove that I am not and never will be in control. You inhabit my heart no wonder youre unhappy trapped in some cold unfamiliar prison that you cant even see. Wasted moments days years eons spent not knowing what I could have had and losing it. Breathing takes an effort that I dont think I have. And why is it that nothing can ever be just easy good or comfortable? Every situation comes with strings attached a laundry list of bullshit to be dealt with and guilt to be endured. How have I survived this long? How did we get here to this cold and empty place? I have forgotten where I came from. It has ceased to matter. All that matters is right now I am sitting in my empty bed waiting for the sun to rise and morning to begin so that I can wait for the moon to rise and then do it all again. My loneliness consumes me. I am no longer human. If I could raise the dead Id have an army by my side. ,cripplingalcoholism,cpb0dxk,6,t5_2s68b

3546245,0,t3_30q25n,Hrm...Disclaimer Not a doctor.OK.  This sounds more like the less serious alcoholic hallucinosis and not delirium tremens.  If you know the hallucinations are not real youre probably in the clear.  If you cant distinguish between reality and unreal manifestations of the mind then you might be on the cusp of fullblown DTs and thats a very serious problem that requires immediate medical attention.The former usually happens within  hours of reduction or cessation in booze consumption.  The latter more serious condition usually happens between  hours.  With other longeracting sedatives this can occur even a week later or more.You greatly minimize your risk of complications like this by reducing your consumption gradually rather than abruptly but your safest bet is to check yourself into detox.  That way they can measure your vital signs and if anything catastrophic happens they can pump you full of drugs to calm your nervous system down before your brain gets scrambled like yesterdays eggs.Its certainly not something to fuck around with.  Its becoming less common because we now know how alcohol interacts with the brain but withdrawal still occasionally kills people.,cripplingalcoholism,cpwhtan,1,t5_2s68b

I just worked at full hour shift at Borders and was looking forward to just going home and doing nothing.A lady friend calls me and asks ...wanna go to Vegas?At this point she wasnt quite  yet... so her gambling would be illegal.  Buuut... I oblige.  Soon as Im off work I pick her up and we drive straight to Vegas.  I think it took about four hours.Me being me I decided that all I was going to bring with me was one dollar.  I was going to find the biggest slot machine I could find put it in and see what happened.I lost.  This was in the Luxor.I just kind of shrugged and moved on.She kept at it though... she was playing slots and winning a good chunk of change.  I was concerned when the hopper ran out of coin and some slot techs had to come over to refill the machine... I was convinced they were going to ask her for ID and then wed be kicked out.But nah.  She was sly.She won a small jackpot all in nickels.  She took it all in nickels.  We went to Dennys and ate some breakfast food then started to drive home.  We paid for gas all in nickels.This was one of the only times I ever fell asleep at the wheel.  edit mind you we were fully stopped at the time in an endless line of cars... but I managed to stay awake the rest of the way home...  It was morning now and we were in rush hour traffic.I slept like a baby throughout my Saturday.  We had fun... man... I miss that.

Let me tell you people on the ground had no fucking clue what was happening.  Some people thought we were being bombed some people said stuff about planes one asshole told me that they heard on the radio that more than  major US cities including LA and San Francisco had been attacked.  Then he asked me for  dollars.For some reason I wasnt frightened at all.  I walked through the whiteout back to my office and then to my husbands office to see if he was still there he worked very nearby.  Police kept catching me and putting me in buildings to stay safe but I wasnt buying that shit.  Someone was attacking the buildings downtown.  So I kept popping out again until I got out of downtown and walked home.Ive been back to NY a couple of times since we left which wasnt long after  and the citys atmosphere was so changed it was like a different place.

Which means you are going to have to taper your way back to sobriety or as close to it as you can imagine. Which means it is not drink time.    I cant speak to the specifics  too many variables.  However nothing is going to happen unless you get your feet back on the ground and start behaving like a responsible adult.    Perhaps not what you want to hear but thats my take on the situation.    You might have to face the fact that you are not going to be able to be the saviour in this situation.  It might be too fucked up for that to happen in the time frame youve set up.  Unfortunately there are consequences to this lifestyle and sometimes they unfold over months not just the next morning.    This is going to be a hard one to navigate.

Mine had expired at the beginning of this year and I procrastinated getting it back. Once you apply and are approved and it will tell you if you are you are able to backdate medical costs up to three months before you get insurance. EDIT For instance I had an E.R. visit a week after I was approved and all the bills went to my insurance because it was already on file... even though I didnt have the actual insurance card yet. All I had to do was sign the consent form for them to be billed.Wait it out for now unless you are really terribly concerned. But if I were you Id google your state insurance page and apply tomorrow.

4640491,0,t3_3efjl7,Durch First and foremost I want to congratulate you on your success. Having known you for a few years I can see the paradigm shift after these  months.I really like to see this post in this sub because there are some people in here that arent bottom drinkers as you describe yourself. Some of us in here try going to stop drinking and are repulsed by the AA shit people are peddling or just disgusted by the optimism of that sub.  What you have is a concrete post of how you have maintained yourself in a nonimposing manor and I appreciate it a lot.  In return I will do a little inventory myself and post my current status after my comments on your post.When you mentioned getting into new hobbies and buying things but never following through but eventually getting the time to follow through is a huge struggle for me personally. If I buy this bike I will stay sober. never works out for me.Sobriety is very strange for me as I have some different mental illnesses.  I have tried staying sober while on meds and the combination of just being sober and pouring in new drugs REALLY fucks me up and never in a good way. Always back at square one.  I think I have maybe a total of  months of sobriety in the past  years.Where I currently stand in the stage of my life sobriety might have a place long term.  I greatly fear being forced into sobriety and I think that if either of my parents die I will be left with little choice of being a complete piece of failure shit or trying to deal with  incredibly huge life hurdles at the same time.  I am constantly on the move getting to new places where people dont know my past and dont judge me but it can be a matter of time until it all turns into shit.  I really dig the island life because this is where alcoholics go to fit in and function and so far as I can tell nobody where I currently am would label me as an alcoholic.I have made some great strides this year in at least embracing sobriety in some aspect of my life.  I intentionally over work myself  hours a week and dont get a day off so I dont have those really shitty days at work.  Pulling  hour shifts and trying to get drunk after on beer is an impossible task.  I had my first day off last week and I loaded up my backpack with a  pack of beer and rented a fat bike and rode for . hours on every trail on the island stopping at the major lookout points to enjoy a beer and the view.My best option for long term sobriety would be to stop for at least a month before I relocate because environment is the biggest factor in addiction.  If I can go somewhere where I can openly say i dont drink and not feel an overwhelming sense of dread or judgement I might be able to swing it.  At the same time I place myself in places where I can look like a saint by maintaining my functionality compared to other people who dont recognize they are alcoholics or just plain dont give a shit.One thing a bartender friend brought up to me who is one of the only people on this island that knows that I am  a CA and wasis one himself hasnt quit but rarely drinks and stacks money during the season and travels all winter is tackling a hiking trail like  miles. camping carrying all your shit with you.  I think he planted an idea in my head that if I went out there to do something that was in my ballpark working out and pushing myself while also being sober by my own choosing cant find booze in the middle of the sticks i might make some peace with my addiction.That is all I have for now again I really appreciate this post more than you can imagine and I am camped outside of a closed starbucks to get the internet to post this to you.Cheers to all you out there.,cripplingalcoholism,ctfi1lw,3,t5_2s68b

4661849,0,t1_cths4ty,No student loans! There is always a grift in the system to take advantage of. In the words of the immortal Stanhope swing around the brass pole a few times. Moreover if the OP is in poverty he will certainly qualify for all sorts of aid. Just fill out the FAFSA. Also if you volunteer for certain positions in Americorps you are eligible for the Edward R. Sagal award which is a five thousand dollar grant from the federal government. Thats how I paid for some of my school. Moreover I would recommend against going to the university. Its unnecessarily expensive and you get pretty much the same education you would if you just went to  a community college. You get out of education what you put into it and going to a fancy school more often than not doesnt change that basic fact not saying fancy schools dont have more resources and better more experienced teachers just saying you have to balance this against the absurdly overinflated prices of school these days. Community college is much cheaper. My local one is a hundred dollars a credit! You can literally get an associates degree in something like nursing for about five thousand bucks compare that to the forty thousand dollars youd be in the hole for if you went to the university. Just my two cents. Also most community colleges have federal grants to help students who are either below the poverty line firstgeneration college students in their family or have learning disabilities. They provide all sorts of services for free like tutoring and meal plans and whatnot. Just go to the Student Services office and tell them about your situation and they will be more than happy to help you.As for the meds well at the end of the day thats your call OP. I am certainly not qualified to offer my opinion on it. I would say however err on the side of a healthcare professional. See what they have to say. ,cripplingalcoholism,cti6kh5,2,t5_2s68b

5164521,0,t1_cv7wu0l,Yeah I had an ALR hearing which got my license suspended for  months. I also lost it for a year after I ended up with the conviction.  I blew twice the legal limit and looked terrible on video.  My lawyer said that Tarrant County judges are very proprosecution and juries tend to be very conservative here.  He said my chances of winning were about  best case scenario.  So I took a plea that gave me a conviction but kept me off probation out of jail and with no community service or anything.  I had to pay the fines but was then done with it other than having to get an occupational license to drive legally.I drove without a license for about  months but got scared th of July weekend last year when it was a no refusal weekend and there was just a sea of police pulling people over on the highways.  So I freaked out and got the occupational license which also required me to get an interlock device for the remaining six months.,cripplingalcoholism,cv8il9y,1,t5_2s68b

5321776,0,t3_3nwl4q,Im with uhellishgoodintention. These are times when you just have to say fuck the hospital bills and get yourself to the ER if this doesnt clear up very very quickly. Fuck it might mean you are going to be paying  a week for your ER bill for the rest of your fucking life but at least you will have one.    I have no experience with pancreatitis but understand that it is extremely painful if acute.   gtWiki symptoms The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe upper abdominal or left upper quadrant burning pain radiating to the back nausea and vomiting that is worsened with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of internal bleeding. Blood pressure may be elevated by pain or decreased by dehydration or bleeding. Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated. The abdomen is usually tender but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease bowel sounds may be reduced from reflex bowel paralysis. Fever or jaundice may be present. Chronic pancreatitis can lead to diabetes or pancreatic cancer. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of pancreatic enzymes hindering digestion  Basically not something you want to take chances with.  In order to treat it often you have to refrain from eatingdrinking of any sort for some time. You might try do nothing for an hour and see how you feel even if you shaking like a fucking leaf from no alcohol.    Best bet if no ER  phone a fucking free health line staffed with trained nurses etc and perhaps follow their advice.,cripplingalcoholism,cvrx3jt,3,t5_2s68b

5499932,0,t3_3qccvk,gt Cant explain it no legitimate reason to drinkI can.  Total abstinence increases the cravings to drink and drink even more when you ahem relapse I hate that stepper jargon.  Advice  look into harm reduction naxeltrone etc.  You know shit that actually has data to back up its efficacy.  AA dues to its anonymous nature has no available data to indicate how effective it actually is you just have to take AAs word for it.  IMO AA does more damage than it does good for a drinker.Oh yeah since you had  or  benders this past year which I would say is probably an improvement from your previous years you are gonna have to feel ashamed of yourself and start back with your  chip.  Personally I think ONLY  benders in the past year is something you can be proud of but then again I think AA is bullshit.Look at it this way  If I get drunk every day for a year but then reduce that to getting drunk  to  days a year shouldnt that be celebrated as a success?  The total abstinence preached by steppers on sets you up for binges cuz if you do happen to drink one beer AAcultmentality tells you its a relapse so if youve already lost your chips why just drink one beer?  Why not drink  since youve already relapsed and have to start from the beginning?Another CA shared this link and its pretty eyeopening The Irrationality of AAYoure not an idiot youve just bought into AA bullshit and dont feel bad I bought into it once myself and so have many others.

5542629,0,t1_cwjmnj3,Interesting. Im sure its different in different states. Im in NY. Here typically someone ends up in a state facility if they cant be safely discharged to the streets within about a month. The bar for a safe discharge is really very low I had a client tell me over the phone that he wanted to be discharged so he could kill himself but that he wouldnt tell this to the doctors because he knew they would keep him. I of course relayed this to the doctor who was like No fucks given Im sending him home to the underpass where he lives. To be mandated into psychiatric treatment you need to have multiple involuntary hospitalizations related to med noncompliance in which you became an imminent threat to yourself and others. Theres only a handful of people who meet that criteria and in a pretty long time of being in the field Ive only ever worked with one person who had that court ordered and Ive worked with some mad scary peoplepeople who literally tell me theyve killed people or raped people and are not even a little bummed about it. Ive seen people land in hospitals nearly dead because they were too mentally ill to stop sitting in a snowbank and needing multiple amputations due to frostbite and judges being like Nah theyre not sick enough for mandated psych treatment even though they dont understand why they just got all their toes amputated and the temp is still . Im sure to a certain extent it depends on the judge. Or one time I called  for someone who was literally naked on the street and covered with days worth of fecesshit caked everywhere they were scooping shit up and into bags like a weeks worth of shit and EMTs came and were like They seem finewouldnt even take them in for a workup just to be safe. I have literally never ever heard of someone being held involuntarily because of substance abuseeven clients who land in the ER several times a week I had a client be taken to the ER three times in ONE DAY and they kept letting him gohe was usually in the hospital  times a week in general but x a day was getting a little crazy even for him.

If your really bad plan kills people you killed those people.Stalin had people killed at will and thrown in gulags for speaking against his tyrannical regime. Mao had people imprisoned for criticizing the government and probably did the extrajudicial killings as well but its really hard to prove conclusively. Neither minded the deaths of millions of their own enough to change course very much at all. Thered be a population left because not caring about people doesnt mean you want to exterminate them. Life expectancy might have gone up but it probably didnt double maybe if infant morality went down drastically I could see it and medical science was advancing worldwide regardless of how retardedly you try to revolutionize your nation. Both Stalin and Mao were responsible for far more than  million deaths each.Those werent directed by the Christian state that was Christendom it no longer existed at the time. They were just perpetrated by Christians. Were not tallying up every crime committed by Muslims and Christians were comparing the actions committed by members of the radical interpretations of those religions in the name of those religions. Even if I did grant that those crimes were done in the name of Christianity I dont theres no ISlike group of Christians because to commit the types of crimes ISIS commits is antithetical to Christianity. You cant  name nearly as many examples of radical Christians in the modern era committing violence in the in the name of their religion as you can Muslims maybe you can if you count a few African countries but like much of Africa those countries have poor documentation. Yes according to the New Testament visiting violence upon those who violate laws set down for Christians to abide by is a sin. There are many hypocritical Christians who do not understand their own holy text.Edit The ChristianMuslim violence thing was started by you saying that the Crusades could be compared to modern Islamic violence. I think weve gotten off track but I want to point out the Crusades were perpetrated by a Christian statelike entity which no longer exists. Furthermore no one is trying to establish one at least not very effectively outside of Africa arguably. As long as groups continue to try to establish an Islamic caliphate they cannot be compared. The IS is the Islamic State. ,cripplingalcoholism,cx63qud,1,t5_2s68b

This is like  times cheaper than the equivalent amount in whippets the first time and after that you can keep the tank and just refill it so its like  times cheaper. NOTE If you do this DO NOT make a mask or other direct delivery method to you. Youll pass out and suffocate and not notice  your body doesnt notice a lack of oxygen only a buildup of CO.

8015931,0,t3_4oza0t,I guess Ill use this opportunity to apologize to this community. At one point I made a post or  that kinda made it sound like I find entertainment in crippling alcoholism. After someone commented that their life is hell I realized what Id done. Part of it had to do that Id mostly just been reading posts that dont have really depressing titles and part of it is that theres definitely a sense of humor amongst the people in this sub so I find some of the posts entertaining. But I deleted those posts after I realized how horrible they might have sounded because some of you really have issues that I dont wish on you and I dont find entertainment in that. You all seem like good people to me. I know crippling alcoholism cuz I see it in my family and it is really shitty. Im sure Im headed towards some degree of being an alcoholic if Im not already considered that to begin with hopefully its never considered a real problem for me.

Shed been clean for a while but her shitbag boyfriend bought some and she decided to go and sell it. I knew that the whole situation was fucked but I was too busy puking in the tub to fully comprehend it. I made plans to come out and visit her she said she was going to go to some hot springs in the desert where she could relax and look at the stars and be with other hipstershippies. In a brief moment of lucidity my last text to her was trying to see if she was okay. The next morning I couldnt get in touch with her looked on facebook and her sister had posted that she had lost her battle with depression. I was a selfish shit and dumped my problems on her and even if I could forgive myself for it I dont want to because I deserve to suffer for that. ,cripplingalcoholism,d5p4fue,10,t5_2s68b

I got past the shame of the routine because the clerks were so cool about it. For example at  am every day I would bring my preschooler with me to the first stop of the day and he would get a lollipop. No judgment from the clerk. One of the afternoon stops carved out a special area of the walkin just for my brand of beer at the time. I got to know the clerkowner and helped him with immigration paperwork for his son. After that he gave me a discount on my beer. When I got sober I disappeared from his store abruptly for months. When I finally got the nerve to go in filled with guilt and shame for my past drinking he hugged me said he was happy I was sober and wished me well. He said he knew I was struggling but it was not his business. Good guy. Try to find cool clerks is the moral I guess. ,cripplingalcoholism,d7cwbas,25,t5_2s68b

But...this wont work.When you see your doctor roll his or her eyes its because you are the hundredth severe alcoholic this week that has tried to bargain their way out of this.There is no magic pill unfortunately. You can get on benzos and get sober for a couple days weeks months. But If you dont figure out why in the first place you are going to drink again. I only know this because this isnt a unique condition. You and literally millions of people are right where you are right now every day.Coming clean to your SO is tough. It leaves you vulnerable. Lying is easier safer at least in the short term. The logistics are tricky. And relationships based on lies probably dont last.If you have been able to hide your drinking for a long time...either they are stupid or in denial. You know them better than us. Will they leave you if you admit weakness? If yes. Do you want to be with someone that would leave you when you are at your lowest?Good luck.

10011388,0,t1_dbbwmg6,us women are weird in the sense that we need that emotional connection in order to be intimate. I mean yeah when were single ladies we can absolutely bang some random dudes and thats great. but when it comes to maintaining intimacy with our partners it takes a little more work.do you show affection on a regular basis out of love and not just out of the desire to get laid? do you spend time together? do you communicate your feelings for her your appreciation for her things like that? I dated a dude for ten years and totally lost interest in sex the last two years and I honestly thought something was wrong with me or with my body. I spent countless hours googling the female libido and what to do to boost it. turns out there wasnt anything wrong with me I just didnt feel any kind of connection to my partner who was on the road  or  days out of the week. sexual intimacy is very important in a marriage because theoretically the onlyperson you can have that with is your spouse.she doesnt know youre drinking? even if she doesnt Im sure she can feel a palpable rift in your relationship. and when it comesdown to us CAs everything takes a backseat to our drinking. she must feel that. why dont you feel like you can be honest about your drinking? marriage means for better or for worse. I would strongly consider telling her  her response may surprise you. she may come back at you from a place of love and compassion. she may blow you right then and there.Id also consider reading about the five love languages and learn how to speak hers. theres a theory that says we all speak one of five love languages  physical touch words of affirmation receiving gifts quality time and acts of service. learning your partners love language is helpful. and dont discount couples counseling. it sounds cheesy and ridiculous but I assure you its actually great and can break ground on a stagnant relationship. but be honest with her. we all deserve honesty. and you deserve to feel that you can be honest. ,cripplingalcoholism,dbcigpz,7,t5_2s68b

11490390,0,t1_dfy9m7w,Im quite curious howwhy you think youve managed to vomit blood from your liver. Lol... if youre somehow that far gone healthwise you would certainly know it already. Honestly its bright red. Its probably esophagealstomach irritation or something if anything at all. It would be concerning if you continued vomiting large amounts of blood or if it was coffeeground type blood. Conventional medical advice always screams GO TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IF YOU VOMIT BLOOD but alcoholics are not healthy normal patients and one instance of vomiting blood is not typically immediately an emergency. If you go to the ED theyre probably going to tell you you have gastritis or something and to cut back on the drinking. ,cripplingalcoholism,dfyfn8r,3,t5_2s68b

Little did I know it was the biggest meeting in town probably around  people or so sitting around with coffee and smokes and when it came my turn to introduce myself I was nervous as fuck and barely stuttered out my name. Never went back to that one needless to say.Next time around was a smaller group but a few towns away with a friend of a friend. Still felt so out of place just wanted out of there and grab some drinks.Next few meetings were by myself parked in the Kmart parking lot blasting Rammstein with a flask. Husband was so proud lol.If I ever had to go to another one I think my topic would be how everyone felt about crippling anxiety without booze and puking your way through the first few drinks so you dont get the shakes and how youre more normal when full of booze then without. Maybe they would get it but somehow I doubt it.Oh and the shitting thing my most memorable time was early in the morning kids getting ready for school and just couldnt hold it another second..I felt like the chick in Bridesmaids when she shit in the street..yup it just happened,cripplingalcoholism,dgl112u,2,t5_2s68b
