1581132,0,t1_cje0s9t,Its like they switched spots Linden used to be the strong one but now Holder is basically trying to keep her strong so she wont put them both in  prison. ,TheKilling,cjeh3ot,3,t5_2s7ku
1589596,0,t3_2caorv,Im finding it a little hard to suspend disbelief at Lindens slip up at the end. Really? She goes to the lakehouse in broad daylight doesnt check to see if anyone is around and then just dumps the phone for any bystander to see?,TheKilling,cjfjfns,8,t5_2s7ku
1595940,0,t1_cjfcj5g,he so put himself out there.  and like directly after he pretty much declared his love for her keep in mind that they worked together for only a few months and that they hadnt seen each other in years when she recoiled instinctively and said something about getting a parking ticket or whatever and he stopped her she had this look like she was waiting for him to just say some specific words words he never said.  and then she drove around and processed it all and ended up rolling to the rosie larsen field and affirmed it herself like she made this decision to stop searching to live with her past and reconcile it as best she can whatever that holder was too wise to demand of her.  just really brilliant totally finished the series off perfectly.,TheKilling,cjgc6an,9,t5_2s7ku

3525592,0,t3_30nvjy,Season  and two are about the Rosie Larson case the consecutive seasons are each their own story. I really liked all of the seasons for different reasons whether its subject matter or the characters. Seasons  and  really get in to the family dynamic after the murder that doesnt happen as much in the consecutive seasons. A solid show stick with it!,TheKilling,cpu551d,3,t5_2s7ku
3679188,0,t3_2wkdb8,Im assuming you are talking about the last scene of the series? its funny you say that because the creators have basically said they didnt want to force the relationship and left it open for interpretation. They didnt show them kiss or anything in the last scene so I left it as it could have been a friendship or a relationship. I thought the last scene was honestly perfect with Lindens speech it summed up the series perfectly. ,TheKilling,cqbngym,1,t5_2s7ku
8377879,0,t3_4udenm,Ive watched the first season of HTGAWM and just finished the rd season of The Killing. I honestly would say theyre not very similar at all. The Killing is tough to watch but it will hook you and the acting is superb. You will have to watch a lot of detective work but I think its worth it. There are twists and turns but not  in every episode and not in such a dramatic way as HTGAWM.If you find it too sad then maybe its not for you. I watched the first two seasons a year or two ago but the rd definitely feels much more dark.,TheKilling,d5os8as,10,t5_2s7ku
