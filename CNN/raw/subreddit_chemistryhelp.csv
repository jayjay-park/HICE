11181157,0,t3_5zjwf3,The way I always do this is to use PVnRT. If you arent familiar with it its known as the combined ideal gas law. The problem gives you P partial pressure of N V volume of the tank T temperature and R is a known standard value.Quick note on the partial pressure of nitrogen given normal air is  N so this is a normal value. So our values areP system . atm P partial N . atm V .LR .T C Kn is the amount in moles of nitrogen if we use the partial pressureYou will need your temperature in Kelvin to use this value for R.SoPVnRT .x   n x . x .  . x n n ..n . molN   gmol.     g NI would double check your . g answer its pretty far off what it should be.,chemistryhelp,dezddxh,0,t5_2uujw
