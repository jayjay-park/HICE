1056894,0,t1_chof0xw,I have to agree. They are trying to create drama. I dont want to see Elliot getting served papers in an airport parking lot. Drama is fine as long as its on the boats,deadliestcatch,chof95f,2,t5_2sj2t

1516519,0,t3_2bhdba,Aw I thought she would take a stint on the Wizard Keith would treat her like any of his other greenhorns a distraught Mandy would quit after King Crab season then sign on for opies on the Cape Caution where Captain Wild Bill would make her work twice as hard.  At that point Mandy would probably leave crab fishing altogether and hook up with Emily Riedel and the Eroica and hunt for gold.,deadliestcatch,cj6deu9,2,t5_2sj2t

1591528,0,t3_23qlus,I dont really get the Elliot hate sure the guy can be a whiny tosser from time to time but as far as I can tell hes just insecure as hell and makes up for it by posturing. Hes getting better though hes kinda like Keith in his first season on the show these days.,deadliestcatch,cjfs6xl,1,t5_2sj2t
4387112,0,t1_csgpzfy,I dunno. It felt like Andy was coming on to right the ship as it were. Jonathan did NOT seem to have a handle on things with the whole Danny situation so Andy coming on might be just the whip crack that the whole boat needs. ,deadliestcatch,csk5x3a,2,t5_2sj2t

7947640,0,t1_d42o9sf,The Keith thing is a little weird.  Keiths marriagefamily broke up and Im sure he was carrying a lot of guilt over why.  Maybe he thought Im too private of a person to publicly air my dirty laundry and Im sure he saw how the whole ElliotBaby Mama drama storyline played out on TV and just didnt want his personal life to be part of the show and told the producers so.  Still it would have been interesting to hear him talk about it with Mouse or Johnathan or even a cameraman up in the wheelhouse during a long night.,deadliestcatch,d49e15z,1,t5_2sj2t
