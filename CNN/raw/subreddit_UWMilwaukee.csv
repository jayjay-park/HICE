If you can afford the dorms you can afford an apartment.If the East Side is too expensive look at Riverwest or other neighborhoods slightly further away from campus. Expect to find roommates too. A br split is significantly cheaper than a br or studio.,UWMilwaukee,cfwfzpf,13,t5_2scoy

3899326,1,t1_cr0qldq,Im sure at least a few of my complaints you wont agree with but perhaps some Im disappointed  that it promotes Anita Sarkeesian and her shoddy research making presumptuous claims about the harassment she received and ignores the harassment she has sent. Im disappointed  that despite having sent this article to all of the students we are not allowed to comment on the article to share our opinions as there is no comment system. Im disappointed that the sample size being used for their study their dissertation is based upon is only twenty people when there are between  million   million male gamers in America alone and this does not even cover female participants or other genders. Im disappointed that they have made all the participants anonymous so any possible meaningful data that could have been extracted or looked at has been erased.  It makes the study seem likely their emotion are more important than the facts.  How do I know all of the participants arent from a sect that all hold the same opinions?  How do I know this data even if it were large which it isnt is meaningful? Im disappointed that part of their inspiration lies from gaming on Xbox Live playing Call of Duty.  This is probably the place youll find the most gender harassment which mostly comes from children and adolescents.  Yet even so they are using these experiences to label gamers as a whole and men as well. Im disappointed that what started out as a largely male targeted medium is being looked down upon purely because it was often originally created and targeted by men as if this is wrong. Thats like me being upset that erotic novels are largely targeted at women. Im disappointed that it assumes that the harassment is mostly or even solely targeted at woman and even worse purely for being woman.  Male gamers haven been harassed while gaming since its inception.  It is nothing new or exclusive. Im disappointed that analyzing and reacting to a players skills in a competitive game is looked down upon even when gender is not considered.  Yes it can be rude but it doesnt mean that the criticism of your gameplay is charged with sexist homophobic or prejudiced insults.  The players are largely being commented on by their ability to play the game. The article itself makes claims about women being half the gaming demographic. Clearly theyve made this claim based on a study that includes mobile games and does not represent the more hardcore gaming community as a whole where the perceived problem they are discussing exists solely.  The number of those gamers in that hardcore community is mostly male by  to . Im disappointed that male sexual harassment doesnt seem to be worthy of consideration.  As if no male gamer has ever been told to suck a dick. Im disappointed by the onesided nature of the article and the study having not looked at the criticism of their claims or not discussing it. Im disappointed that the article asks the reader to have an unbiased viewpoint and clearly has a biased viewpoint itself. Im disappointed that Gamergate has been represented this way even though the lawyers of Gawker media admitted that Gamergate has nothing to do with harassment and is entirely about the ethics of gaming journalism. Im disappointed that the author of the article has no available email to contact her or her full name to ensure that she can be reached for comment. Im disappointed that all of the following Ive listed above despite all these criticism and potential flaws is promoted by our University.  It is in my opinion that it is being promoted solely to promote their stance on gender studies and the humanities.,UWMilwaukee,cr0r9ov,2,t5_2scoy
