4761222,0,t3_3g27tw,I work at The Lakeland Center. There is going to be a pit set up so I wouldnt get seats in the first few rows because there is a wall that is used to close off the pit and it blocks the view for smaller peopleeven some adults. Id get tickets in the middle Orchestra  maybe row F H I thereabouts. The rows start at AAA BBBthese two rows were added after the fact then go A B C so on until J then there is wheelchair seating in row K with an aisle behind the wheelchair seating then regular seating starts again at L and goes until M.  ,lakeland,ctup2z3,7,t5_2s2xw
