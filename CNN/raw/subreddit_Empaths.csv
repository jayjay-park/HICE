2652591,0,t3_2ng7qz,I have an empathic friend and she and I connected right away.  Shes also one of the only people who I truly feel has the level of understanding that I do as far as what it means to listen.  She makes me know that Im not alone or some crazy out of balance person with freaky emotions .  We clicked so well I felt like Ive known her forever kinda like you and your new friend.  Its pretty great!,Empaths,cn4tonj,3,t5_2zhl2
4183548,0,t3_38q3mb,What I would do here... is clear my mind meditate or whatever you do when im at my clearest and most powerful and then spend time with that person and feel out their emotions and mental state.  Basically give yourself a blank slate to work with while your calm and able to notice subtle changes in energy.  Understanding other people requires you to understand yourself first.  Knowing your own cycle with your ability... when your strongest or weakest.  If your weak their emotional state will show in you if your strong you will notice it bounce off of you or absorb it depending on how you control your ability.  Keep calm and know yourself first then understanding others will come more easily and more intimately,Empaths,crx4los,1,t5_2zhl2

5001004,0,t3_3j8l53,Holy shit. Ive been noticing this shit going on for a while but I have absolutely noone to talk to about it because nobody gets it. Yay empaths! Its fifth dimensional unity consciousness rising really fast. Its been getting crazier since the last solstice.Everything is coming into the light. Absolutely everything. There is no hiding anymore and its going to be getting faster and faster and at some points scarier because people are still going to try and find logic in it and fight it but resistance is absolutely futile. All theres left to do now is let go let it in and keep going.,Empaths,cuot47a,6,t5_2zhl2

8201379,0,t1_d52oyqi,Thank you. I want to believe this.. But I dont know if he wants to change and I dont know how he feels about me. He said once that he believes everyone has multiple soul mates. I dont know what to believe. Whenever we talked I couldnt shake the feeling that whatever he said to me was said to other women and I was always afraid he was lying. One of the last things I said to him was kind of an ultimatum. I told him to just tell me how he feels about me because I need to know if Im his friend or what he wants. He just didnt respond at all. Hes insensitive and it hurts. But I just dont know. ,Empaths,d52q5e9,1,t5_2zhl2

8841925,0,t3_51b52i,What SpookyVal wrote is pretty much what I was going to say. If you have intent you will likely manifest it. Just dont try to control the outcome or how it happens or worry about how it will happen like how or where youll meet other empaths. Just intend that you will and it will manifest in its own way. ,Empaths,d7ao9tt,2,t5_2zhl2
8893231,0,t1_d7frzbp,Im going to check Fringe out. Ive heard before that its a great show.  Add one more to my Netflix cue.What do you mean by side of the empath spectrum? Could you help me understand this a little better? I know some but because there are sooo many people who relate to the empath trait list it makes it difficult to really understand what certain things mean or if what you mean is what I think it means.  There are alot of teachers out there who teach different terms about the same thing.  Then theres those who teach different things altogether when sometimes they lack a good understanding of the subject themselves.  I would fall under the latter except I dont know that Id call myself a teacher.  Ive never had formal or informal training or lessons.  So Ill be the first to admit that my knowledge is weaksauce.  Metaphysics in my experience seems to have a lot of things like that.  Since there are a lot of storys and a lot of whats actually occurring is ego driven its tough to discern the wheat from the chaff.  Please dont mistake my question as insinuation. I try to double check my own understandings through others to find commonalities since I would admit to having only a beginner level understanding of any of this at best.  Thanks for the Fringe suggestions. Im going to check both the empath episodes out today.  Also could you suggest any books or sources I could check out? ,Empaths,d7gu8r5,1,t5_2zhl2
9206301,0,t3_569wha,First off youre going to want to stop thinking of him entirely.  Whatever lent up anger involving him is at the front of your mind youll either have to let go or let simmer until it fades to the back of your mind.  While youre doing this youre going to want to remove all reminders of him from your life as possible.  Dont even so much think about him much less contact or see him.  The longer you do this the more the connection weakens.This is not an easy process.  In fact its one of the more difficult psychic processes out there.  If any part of you still feels like you should be together this might not work entirely.  Psychic connections especially strong psychic connections something Empaths seem to create a lot have a tendency to come back if youre not careful.Most of this is going to rely on visualization andor a ritual to help ground the process.  You basically want to either pull the connection out compassionatelyneutrally with positive energy or cut the connection off through negative energy something I wouldnt suggest.  You can use a pair of scissors or knife and a piece of thread to add tangibility to this process but its not neccesary.  Afterwards youre going to want to use energy work to heal the area at which point the connection was formed.,Empaths,d8iyud0,2,t5_2zhl2

9741858,0,t1_dadvju3,What exactly do you mean by physical energetic healing? Taking away physical ailments?In my view telling someone what we sense from them without permission can actually be a violation of free will and as such should not be taken lightly but I used to see it more the way you do.,Empaths,dadwa2q,2,t5_2zhl2
9769557,0,t3_5epw0r,An example from today...  I had just finished buying groceries and was heading to the checkout line in a generally positive mood.  I looked up and saw that  store employees were trying to help a senior citizen who had fallen into a chair.  They were rapidfiring questions at him Do you know where you are?  Do you know what happened to you?  I immediately turned into another aisle knowing what would happen but it was too late.  My mind instantly went from alert and happy to the gray muddled static of his confusion.  I tried to refocus but was a little like mentally trying to sprint in ft of water.I was able to clear my mind by repeatedly telling myself that hes fine hes getting help and doesnt need my concern.Im still new to knowing Im an empath  week and am struggling to control it.  ,Empaths,dahbbnf,3,t5_2zhl2

10242368,0,t3_5m9hd7,Yeah.  Pretty sure it is.  I think its a self defense mechanism to separate yourself from all the negative vibes you pick up on.   Its not a healthy attribute to be sure but its something that happens nonetheless.,Empaths,dc512h2,1,t5_2zhl2

11357054,0,t3_61v7mw,That is a very intense experience and I most certainly would never think of judging your lifepath.   We do our best with what we have.  Being an empath is challenging yet its also a gift.  Your emotions were so overwhelming with regard to your dad.   Yet it was your ability that may have saved him. Some days are tougher than others.  I know today was one for me.  I call them the days the world gets in.   Then you are left to sort out what belongs to you and what you have taken from others.   Always being mindful in my case that you do not project the feelings off on others.  Your SO sounds very special.  Hang onto him.   Anchors are important. ,Empaths,dfjauq9,2,t5_2zhl2
11711922,0,t3_62t4b7,As an empath Ive been able to easily empathize and pick up information from what I think is the electromagnetic fields of another persons heart in the past.
