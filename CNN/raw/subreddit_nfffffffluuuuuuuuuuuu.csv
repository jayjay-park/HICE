41918,0,t1_cej4545,I dont like the Panthers. I was happy when my Cardinals crushed them on Jake Delhommes Bday. But let me say this. Any team that plays against the ers is my favorite team of all time.I fucking LOVE your Panthers and I cant wait for Cam to show Kaep how its done. I am genuinely excited because I dont believe anyone can stop Carolina and I hope the cats CRUSH the Vaginers. Plus I do love cats and I kinda wish my team was a cat team. So count me in as a Panther for the week.Meow meow. ,nfffffffluuuuuuuuuuuu,cej7bws,-1,t5_2tocy
