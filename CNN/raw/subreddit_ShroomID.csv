5183964,0,t3_3llqwm,Hey I like in Canada and I have used these kits a few times. I have had this issue with inky caps coming up. If you pick them off you can still end up getting cubes. Although it looks like you may have contamination. I would contact magicmushroomkit support. They have always helped me out when I have had issues. Good luck!,ShroomID,cvauvvi,1,t5_2xpli

5532525,0,t1_cwinms4,If you could get pictures of the stems. Not just one stem but all of the mushroom stems that would help. The cap doesnt really look familiar to me though. But it doesnt look too unfamiliar for me to say a definite no.,ShroomID,cwitu1g,1,t5_2xpli

9598134,0,t3_5cfxsj,Not active. Most things that are active present blue bruising when pinched or broken. However to get a good id wed need better photos of gills and such.,ShroomID,d9w5zsr,1,t5_2xpli
9737734,0,t1_daddgfn,Yep Ive eaten them in soups though I havent found them in a few years. I would rate them higher than mediocre but definitely not amazing.Have you tried them out?,ShroomID,daddzl5,1,t5_2xpli

11090715,0,t3_5ycvmd,They look like dried amanita muscaria to me but without seeing them fresh it makes it harder to positively identify. I strongly recommend not eating them unless you are  sure you know what they are. ,ShroomID,dep4ftx,2,t5_2xpli
11590943,0,t1_dg9sgbm,Definitely not Proostropharia and its definitely bruising. A good stipe picture would help.,ShroomID,dg9uayo,1,t5_2xpli
