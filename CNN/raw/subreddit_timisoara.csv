1741231,0,t3_2ecpjt,Recomand cu cldur pizza de la Da Toni. Pentru livrri la domiciliu au buctrie separat i pizza e cam average dar dac mnnci acolo la ei e vizavi de Abator pizza e excelent la fel i servirea i tot restul. Preul e pe msur dar dac eti pizzafil eu cred c merit.Alt loc caremi place e Pizza Poli. Pizza mare are  cm i cost ntre  lei depinde de model. Edit Legat de timpii de livrare nam ateptat niciodat mai mult de  de minute. Cei drept nam cronometrat dar nu mori de inaniie pn vine pizza. ,timisoara,cjyn8da,6,t5_2rong
7420031,0,t3_4gvj3n,I want to support you morally here. Im a parttime vegetarian originally from Timisoara. Every time I visit it seems harder to stomach the traditions both at the dinner table and in the conversations surrounding it. I get fed up with the national dish of greasy fried potatoes with fried sausage and fried meat. My grandmother will never understand why I dont want some seared pork ears I used to love as a child. I visited the grandparents in the countryside once during the winter. It was very hard to find a decent vegetable or anything not preserved in lard. There is relief to be found with the younger generation that has grown up with the internet speaks a foreign language and has absorbed ideas from further out than the typical km radius of infogossip that the older people have been limited to.It may be a while before we see a full blown vegan restaurant in town. So theres Biofresh and Restaurant Quinoa downtown.There are likeminded people that can be brought closer through something like reddit. For what its worth Im sending you a virtual highfive. Keep on keeping on buddy!,timisoara,d2lly18,3,t5_2rong
