16860,0,t1_cegcizr,Bummer for you too.Got any suggestions on a brand that would be in about the same pricequality spectrum? I mean the internals of the machine suit me fine its the service that chased me off.That and the fact that some new models get bricked ! if you install linux.

217464,0,t3_1w6bmw,Get the nextday warranty. At least when they had IBM contractors to do service the service was impeccable inside the US. Fantastic service by knowledgeable contractors.I havent had service in a while and I heard they were going to layoff that team and outsource or somehow bring in cheaper technicians. That may reduce their service.The online reps are fairly useless and their please use my rep ID after every statement is annoying. I dont blame them but Lenovo management. Their website isnt great thats for sure.Edit And despite all the shit Lenovo has done to the ThinkPad line its still a class above other vendors. That will probably change in the next generation or two but as of today its still mostly true.,Lenovo,cf37plp,1,t5_2r0pw

724128,0,t3_22erzn,I would not purchase a Lenovo. There are multiple threads from the past week alone regarding terrible customer service. They may have great hardware but the company supporting that hardware doesnt seem very good. If you do purchase a Lenovo maybe look at a thirdparty retailer as well as purchasing a separate warranty.

1623511,0,t1_cjjmuyj,Well they ended up just refunding me for some reason. I didnt complain Im just getting an Asus from the computer shop here I dont have time to wait to get a new custom one delivered. Cant say this gives me a good impression of Lenovo the forums were atrocious as well. Above all I just like to think that I got the one bad unit of the batch but I doubt Ill buy from them again in the near future. The high point of this was getting my money back painlessly.  Maybe Ill try ThinkPad next time I hear they have better support than Idea products. ,Lenovo,cjjt561,1,t5_2r0pw

3750529,0,t3_33bg1s,Hey throwawayThis is a tough question and my apologies for the mixed answers. Ill see what I can do to get a better answer for you. Ill tell you from my experience typically we charge the card once for the order to make sure it is a good card and to hold the charge. Once the order ships we charge it again and this will be the final charge. A lot of times this second charge overlaps the first charge until it drops off. This is why we typically would suggest not using a Visa gift card but Ill look into it further.Thanks!,Lenovo,cqjsb41,1,t5_2r0pw

4818889,0,t3_3gqufv,I own this model. Do NOT buy the UHD if youre doing photography and video. The yellows are awful in such scenarios.Also the hz introduces flicker which is pretty noticeable when the screen is bright. I notice it always when I would login to Windows  and the bright blue lock screen appeared.I bought the laptop for webdev work and although its fine for running VMs and coding it is awful for doing anything within Photoshop.

5877520,0,t3_3vpdbp,. Yes. All the drivers are online.... UEFI is on the board not the drive but every PC launching with W. uses a UEFI even the Surface RT. You can access the UEFI menu even if the drive has been wiped.. Its easy if youre asking about it you should just use a guide to help you. I wouldnt recommend a novice to disassemble it blindly.. I dont see any dust building up there bought mine back in July. I store it in a sleeve and dont use it in dusty areas though.. I use a keyboard cover to avoid this issue but a cleaning cloth can clean the keys too.. I removed most of their bloat except the energy manager because I limit battery to  as I keep it on AC.. Some games require specific driver versions like Star Wars. Other drivers like Bluetooth WiFi etc. are barely updated by the OEM...Broadcom Intel Realtek etc etc update their drivers frequently even though OEMs rarely post newer versions. Realtek does generic releases every other day then DolbyMaxAudio ones about once a month. Intel releases HD drivers RST etc every few weeks. ,Lenovo,cxq2pct,2,t5_2r0pw

11260067,0,t1_df89qwb,Youre right about the CPUs having the GB limit but if Im not mistaken the memory limit tends to be dependent on the chipset used on the motherboard not the CPU itself. This is purely anecdotal but in my recent laptop research I dont recall seeing any current ultrabook CPU models that let you upgrade them to GB. On the other hand more than half of the laptops using HQ series CPUs let you go to GB. If the s motherboard is using the same chipset as the XPSs motherboard you would presume that youd also be able to get up to GB practically GB since GB soldered on unless theyre using a different chipset or have hardware capped the RAM. Seeing how Lenovo limits what wireless cards you can use as replacements I would not be surprised if the  is capped to GB.
