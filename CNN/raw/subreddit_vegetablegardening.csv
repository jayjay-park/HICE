8018121,0,t3_4oarbw,Nice. Were starting to get a few things out of our raised bed too. Also in GA. ,vegetablegardening,d4hb7uo,1,t5_30g5j
8063422,0,t3_4plkzc,I would say either Anaheim or one of those light green banana peppers but youll really just have to wait. Frankly waiting to see what it turns into is the best part of gardening for me.,vegetablegardening,d4meks6,1,t5_30g5j
11325805,0,t3_61cv38,Ive been trying to grow small squash but I never seem to have success. The plants dont take off and end up hit by downy mildew. I think Im finally able to ID female and male flowers better so fingers crossed for hand pollination this year.Also I need to trellis my peas better. Last year I let them roam free on my balcony and ended up with a pea jungle that knocked down their own trellis after a few encounters with wind storms.,vegetablegardening,dffrevx,1,t5_30g5j

11441593,0,t3_63b4jx,Second that.  Also dont bother spraying them unless there is nutrient in the spray just water thoroughly and allow to dry before the next water. Too much water leads to root rot and subsequent nutrient uptake issues.,vegetablegardening,dfsw6z2,2,t5_30g5j
11462110,0,t3_63k4de,This year Im trying Oda peppers and Sugar Magnolia tendril pea from Bakers Creek. A friend of mine grew Purple Beauty peppers last year and they turned out great. In the fall Im going to grow an overwintering purple sprouting broccoli either Red Spear or Rioja. Also if youre not already growing it Orach is like a purple spinach. ,vegetablegardening,dfv81e4,3,t5_30g5j
