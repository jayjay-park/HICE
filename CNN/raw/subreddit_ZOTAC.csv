9731087,0,t1_dace2ua,Not the point. In case the other guy didnt come and say Id void my warranty I wouldve taken off my heatsink and replace the compound. So why is the first guy working for customer service if he doesnt know what his customers can or cant do? I couldve easily ended up with no warranty if the second guy didnt come. Do you see my point? Also you can downvote me as much as you want I am right and if you cant handle it its not my problem.,ZOTAC,dackhmw,1,t5_2vvbq
