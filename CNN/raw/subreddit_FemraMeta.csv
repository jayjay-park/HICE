571422,0,t1_cg57lr7,Holy shit dude what did I do to you? Hell you even have upvotes from me in my RES history.gt More fucking trolling.Pointing out ableism is not trolling. Generally in AMR people are asked to modify their posts to avoid ableism.gt What you say in AMR isnt criticism of FRD and you know it.Yes it is. I think many people in FRD are sexist racist and transphobic and I will point that out. I try not to engage with those kinds of people directly though because thats a sure way to get myself banned.gt You are just some asshole behind a keyboard that gets off on disrupting things in a place you wont get caught. You have made literally zero contributions to FRD that havent been just you trolling.What posts have I made in FRD that werent in good faith?gt You want to prove me wrong? Make two long lengthy posts in FRD that are your own words. Make them start a good discussion on an issue.I think my contributions are fine thank you very much.gt Youre nothing more than another AMR troll.Because people have different opinions of me that must mean they are trolls!,FemraMeta,cg584r6,-4,t5_30ytj
597477,1,t1_cg84u6w,Because egalitarian is a bullshit title. Everyones an egalitarian in their own mind anyways reddit eaglelibrarians just externalize their mental masturbation.

610310,1,t1_cg9mi38,gtPlease explain why youve only repeated your previous argument written before my last post? Because simply put you havent understood it. And I keep trying to no avail to explain it to someone who I doubt very much earnestly wants to understand. There is a difference between calling someone a sexist or flat out saying a person is being sexist and what Ive described showing through argument why a person is being sexist. Heres a great examplewww.reddit.comrFeMRADebatescommentszmcnmetanewruledisallowingcertaintypesofspeechcfqqwhm Notice how uZorbathehut is respectful in getting his point across while at the same time stating his disagreement clearly.gtExcept my objection is to the current zero tolerance policy. Spamming the report button defeats the whole purpose.What does that have to do with some mysterious bias against AMR? Lets grant that report system is imperfect and that people who want other users gone are incentivized to report their posts. Guess what? It happens to everyone all the damn time not just you. The best way to avoid being banned? Learn the damn rules! gtI already covered that one earlier too. Theres a difference between why a rule is created and how its applied.Why do you get the sense that you are the one whos covered the topic and had the same points flung in your face? The reason I keep repeating it is that youre not getting it. No one disagrees that how rules are applied are different from what the rules are and why a rule is created. No argument. But what is your point? See you keep stating and restating these generalities as though you actually think they prove something. I know the word evidence is a touchy subject but jesus some of it would be nice. You know I can claim anything I please. But that doesnt make it true. gtPerhaps thats advice you should consider?I have considered it. Thats why I try always to examine an issue from the other perspective. I dont see you doing that at all.gt Ive met a few good MRAs. But from what I understand youre completely misunderstanding the complaint. When writers and posters in A Voice For Men mensrights historyoffeminism dot com and others simply rewrite history in order to make their case it shouldnt be given the same consideration as a feminist theory which actually did some research first.Ive met a few good feminists as well. Usually theyre incapable of carrying a debate without devolving into emotional pleas or ignoring massive double standards but I find that to be true of anyone whos been indoctrinated within a certain ideological framework without having been exposed to the world of ideas and criticisms that exist without. Look I dont think that anyone should get away with rewriting history whether theyre feminists or MRAs. If you think that these sites are being brought up to represent false historical positions then youre perfectly free to post corrections cite your sources and explain the problems. But since I havent seen any MRAs post historical links from these sites and given that Ive been in this subreddit for quite a bit longer than you I would guess that this is just a lazy strawman. And further this was not what I was talking about. I was talking about how before you joined AMR there were multiple threads in which top comments mentioned how horrible the sub was for placing MRAs and feminists on equal footing  one is a hate movement the other legitimate social justice.tm So actually I think its you who isnt addressing the point. gtIm curious why the selective outrage? What outrage? What are you talking about? Have you been following this discussion? Its not about attacking AMR its not even rmensrights. Its about rfemradebates and whether or not the rules are unfairly applied to AMR members. As far as I can see you havent provided any evidence or rational argument.

1996300,0,t1_cktejuq,Im not angry with you but I specifically referred to the comments. I said that the OP was designed as an end run around a Rule  and that  of the comments broke Rule . You answered in a way that I took to mean youd read the comments and they largely passed muster with you. Was that not your implication?As I said elsewhere generally I dont like to get into arguments over what someone really said. I am concerned about my own bias in reviewing comments so I hope you can understand that I am going to be concerned about someone whom I obviously dont know as well as I do myself.I did not respond to the specific claims you made about the article because I thought that would just lead to a rabbit hole. You argue one sentence I argue the next. I dont want to miss the forest for the trees. I am genuinely concerned about how we are going to agree if you are missing a larger context that provides some grounding. If you read say a statement from the DMV that implied that failure to renew your drivers license could result in water boarding you would reread it because your contextual knowledge of the society you live in assures you that you cant be tortured for minor failures to comply with the law.Similarly I can tell you in more detail why your take on the Salon article doesnt make sense but I feel like its important to take a step back and ask how likely it is that a mainstream article would advocate genocide as a solution for something that isnt even completely illegal. It just doesnt make sense. Yes to me it also indicates a serious misread of the article but it also makes me wonder why that didnt trigger a reality check.Sure individuals on Reddit say all kinds of terrible things but thats the context of Reddit. Not the context of Salon.EDIT a couple extra things an article is not the same as a Reddit comment. Context does come into play. But what I am more puzzled by is that nowhere in the article did the author say I propose that we reduce the human male population and see if we get the same kind of positive results we saw in the baboon troop I described. You not only inferred this yourself but you decided the person who posted the article also implied this despite the fact that they repeated a main takeaway from the article people are not the same as baboons. But it seems like you think you read the article as literally as possible. So it seems to me like theres a really big disconnect here and I am not sure why it happened.FYI the main takeaway from the article was not that aggressive males need to be murdered for the good of everyone else how would that even work? but that even baboons behave better if circumstances allow for it.

2118942,0,t1_cl951nk,gtThe constant swap between class and individual is where the problem is As the mod who pushed to restrict that sort of classbased analysis in the first place yeah Ill take it on the chin thats one of the main reasons why. I dont believe that the separation between class and individual is anywhere close to as large as some people generally think it is. At best its a very fragile frame that can be shattered without even realizing it. Once you start to apply that classbased analysis to individual people or even situations the idea that its not something that should be taken personally kind of goes right out the window. gtI am not fungible with all other men nor is my experience universal to all men.

Other feminisms are relevant insofar as they affect this nameless feminism. Foucauldian feminists may not go up and lobby governments and pass laws in the name of Foucauldian feminism but they create theory and discourse of what feminism is and should mean which informs feminist efforts to effect change in the world using the political and social power of feminism singular nameless.
