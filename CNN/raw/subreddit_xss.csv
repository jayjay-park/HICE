5043091,0,t3_3jubfk,Check out the OWASP top ten and how to prevent XSS  there are things you cant and really shouldnt do like putting user input into HTML attributes like ltdiv classhere or putting user input directly between ltscriptgt tags like     ltscriptgt    var username  I can put an apostrophe and escape the string and then start writing code and itll end in the quote like this     ltscriptgtAlso you see how in the code you show how to put in a comment?    if submit         .postajaxinsertforumpost id  comment comment function             window.location.hrefwindow.location.href            What happens if you change ID? Is that bad?Because someone can test anything like I tried this    curl XPOST  d id  comment The ajax thing is fucked if this script tag works ltscriptgtfooltscriptgtIm getting  but maybe that has to do with it. Never do clientside cleaning of input and verification that its clean. Do that for convenience check if the email address is formatted correctly but always check server side as well and sanitize all user input. If its only done on the client the client can do whatever they want and modify whats sent out. Personally I just use firefox TamperData and change all output that goes out. No JS in the page can change what eventually gets POSTed.One thing that scares me... Do you see this in your code?    alert pg  hcd By CDGbrtmhThat looks like its inbetween real code and I dont see where user input would get there. I didnt test very hardcore but if they injected code without doing XSS they hacked your site or modified data on it.Is it possible someone legitimately hacked the site not XSS?Personally I think you should take this entire page off the internet and anything else that looks affected. People could infect other computers with your website by putting malicious code on it and linking people to your site. Since guys are already fucking with you and theyre defacing it it could end up like that so personally Id take it offline and test offline checking everywhere that input gets. Even look through your database and find the comment entries and what got stored. You need to delete all rows with this sort of thing and figure out how it would have got in there. Backup your DB so you have something to investigate later after you fix it.,xss,cutvthq,2,t5_2qxe8
