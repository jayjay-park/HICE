They are either liquid or solid according to this NASA article.     I think the cloud takes on an ocean like movement because the clouds are forming in air with a different density than the air without clouds. So they are separated just like a bed of water is from air. ,WeatherGifs,d0eyghg,9,t5_39geq

Yes he is doing a show and he needs views but it gives storm chasers a bad name.Also in addition to this he doesnt really know that much about weather.  In one of his most famous videos he points up to the sky near a tornado and points out the rear inflow jet.  Rear inflow jets are something that full size storms have but not something that you would see near a tornado.  Its clear that he knows just enough to keep from getting killed but storm chasers hate that he is seen as the guy that speaks for their community.Source My wife is finishing up her PhD in atmospheric science.

Trees are fine except for some like palm that get wrapped for winter usually anyway. Some plants like aloe Vera need to be moved inside if potted. Even if they dont its just the leaves that die from being frozen and thawed they lose cohesion or something it turns to mush and theyll regrow in the spring.

I use to live on Maui and worked as a canyoneering guide and put up dozens of routes there So I know all about this setting up egresses etc. This is due to EMI East Maui Irrigation for sugar cane long ago. There are miles and miles of tunnels and ditches that run around Haleakala big volcano that supply water to the central valley for the sugar cane. The ditches and tunnels have spillways that empty into other streams when they get overwhelmed. So it can be raining on one side of the Haleakala and clear over head and you are meet with a wall of water. Maui has over  inches of rain per year this is pretty common and is deadly to tourist.
