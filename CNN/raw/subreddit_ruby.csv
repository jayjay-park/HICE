I guess well keep using Monk until some Sinatra update breaks it and then roll our own solution.Padrino is cool but given that most of the Sinatra sites we build are either simple RESTful facades to another API or basic forms Padrino is more than we need.

That means that when you first show up in Redmineland you see the promise of Redmine add ons created by other users scratching their own itches but in reality most of the time these solutions are halfbaked at best and tailored for the creators specific use case.  Support is nonexistent.  Youll be learning a lot about sysadmin on Ruby servers which happens to be something I enjoy but its a pretty steep climb to start.  Overall the Redmine experience is one of trying not to get mired in too much technical debt and being constantly frustrated that shit doesnt work the way you want it to.If you can get into Jira for free like upreflightsiren says Id recommend that very strongly.

440680,0,t1_cfqe2lp,gt  Gives me k jobs in the USAgt gives me k jobs in the USAAnd Java gives nearly k. So even using your metric the claim that most job offers will be C is false.gt I feel it gives a good idea regarding that there will be more C jobs than ruby jobsI dont really doubt that at all. The issue is that you didnt say that C will lead to more job offer than Ruby. I.e. this is a possibly accidental strawman.gt Regarding most classes what schools are you referring to? I am going based on Computer Science classes at Cuny Hunter and friends from related colleges. So when you say most of your classes you mean most of your classes assuming you go to a certain subset of schools. My retort is that this depends on the school. I dont doubt that some or even many schools do use C for some or even many courses but  simply stating that a future CS student will use C in most classes without any additional qualifications is simply absurd. I for one took a single Cbased course in my   years of CS classes spanning across three schools. Even at schools where CC is an introductory language and used for a few core classes that in no way implies that a given students particular path will be mostly CC since schools typically do not bind students to a single language.In my experience its actually rather common for schools to have an intro language then require another language like C or Java which represent more of what one would see in industry then pretty much arbitrarily picks languages for most other courses. For instance one might learn C then use it in  courses but never use it again because he or she is taking courses related to web applications mobile devices etc. gt Not to mention I cant imagine students completing a computer science major without having a firm grasp on pointers and related low level topics.To begin with this does not imply that most of ones courses will require CC. Additionally CC arent the only languages with pointers. I learned about pointers using Ada for instance.Of course you dont have to take my word for it...Just listen to Joels complaints about the tendency of Universities to become Java Schools,ruby,cfqfw5p,1,t5_2qh21

657056,0,t1_cgewxv2,Well youre correct Im suggesting replace memoization with dependency inversion. Im not confused about it though.gt Memoization is a very useful technique for caching expensive operations and I dont think you should disregard it like you are doing.What Ive learned is that expensive operations often dont belong in the same level of abstraction as the class theyre contained in when you memoize.I still use memoization from time to time but I believe I used to go overboard and Ive noticed many ruby devs make the same mistake.Its sort of like private methods I was noticing how I was clinging to them for encapsulation and noticing my classes were hard to change and often did too much. It was suggested to me to eliminate them altogether for a time and the result was really beneficial for my overall design skills. Memoization is the same story for me I quit cold turkey for a bit learned other tools to solve the same problem and now choose to use it only when its the ideal fit.Ruby devs typically bang out memoization like its second nature thats a habit I think is worth breaking.,ruby,cgeygmx,2,t5_2qh21

2241914,0,t1_clok48v,Exactly.   Im a long time Python coder and new to Ruby and boy oh boy would I be thrilled if we could use Python andor Ruby natively in browsers.  This sounds a bit like Pyjamas.  Or GWT even may I never look at it again.  I see why something like this is attractive but it annoys me that were still stuck with generating Javascript.Actually my dream for browser scripting would be even better than that  an open API integrating with the DOM CSS etc that any language could plug into Ruby Python Perl even compiled languages whatever.THAT would be awesome.  One of the things that absolutely drives me crazy about web programming is that we are pretty much locked into Javascript or something that compiles into Javascript.

I think thats a great way to learn the basics of how Rackbased systems operate.  Moving onto Rails from there will be intuitive and even a welcome thing.  It may be better than spending a lot of time on Rails from the start and not getting a hang of things.

3063719,0,t3_2v8bl8,Ive been using Ruby pretty regularly for about  years now mostly as a hobbyist and in support of my workIm not a professional programmer but I do a lot of programming at work to automate tasks and generally make my job easier and more efficient. About a year and a half ago I wrote my first and so far only Rails application. I seriously had no idea what I was doing. It was like learning a completely different language.I went through a book building the tutorial application and it still didnt make much sense to me but I had enough knowledge at that point to start writing an application. So I started working on it and realized that I wanted to customize certain behaviors. So rather than looking at the way it would be done I just started poking around and figuring out how to do it on my own by applying my existing Ruby knowledge. As I started digging into the code I began to realize what Rails was doing under the hood. Eventually it all clicked and all of a sudden I realized I was getting Rails. The end result was an application that probably isnt exactly enterprisegrade or even terribly secure or functional but it serves its purpose. And if I were to write another Rails application now Im confident I could do a much better job because I now understand how Rails works from the outset.So stick with it. Eventually and suddenly itll all make sense.,ruby,cofjv8w,2,t5_2qh21

3131025,0,t3_2w059b,Imagine an hourglass. The wide part on top are various frameworks like Rails and Sinatra.  The bottom are web servers like Unicorn Thin Mongrel and Rainbows!.So on top we have say  different frameworks and at the bottom we have say  different web servers.How do you get each one to talk to the other?  We could get each author to open up a dialog with all ten teams on the other end individually and write test suites making sure that they are compatible.  Yes we could do that.But that becomes increasingly unreasonable as more people make more webservers and more people make web frameworks.  Wed need hotel conferences for them to all convene and have meetings in order to make sure that framework  works with webserver s new version.Each project in turn would become quite large and complex as the teams implement the dozens of ways needed to interact with various technologies on the other end of the hourglass.A better idea is to have a common interface used in a nontechnical way between frameworks and webservers.  Something that makes all of the webservers kinda look the same although they are different under the hood.  At the other end you need to have some guarantees from the frameworks that they will only be doing certain things and not other things.The pinch in the middle the middle of the hourglass thats rack.  Its a common tool so that I can make a new framework you can make a new webserver and they will work together without us even knowing about each other  so long as we know about rack.Now my framework only needs to talk to rack and then Ill be able to run my app on any webserver that can also talk to rack. Also the application developers can switch out webservers for their sophisticated rack application fairly painlessly. A new one comes along with exciting features? I can try it out with about as much effort as trying on something at a department store.  Really. So all the tools in rack do things like here are my endpoints which use this framework  and here is the server they run on.  Its the common road between the towns of frameworks and webservers,ruby,comj1hk,20,t5_2qh21

Perhaps the API might look something like    def postparams      params.requirepostschema    end And perhaps you have appschemaspostschema.json file that gets loaded and validates the params hash based on that JSON schema file. That might be cool. But thats just all window dressing. Also I can see some problems with adding type validation like when input types dont match what you actually want for example how do I know if some incoming web form field is actually an integer versus a string? Or that a checkboxs  vs  should actually be cast to a boolean instead of an integer?Where I think hes wrong is that the old world of modelbased validation is somehow better. As pointed out elsewhere in the comments as soon as you start needing contextspecific validation admin forms vs user forms for example model based approaches become extremely unwieldly. And putting massassignment protection into those controllers could mean implementing the same code twice is a strawman and Giles is smart enough to know that.

This makes us the first POSIXfriendly JVM language with full support for spawning processes inheriting open streams perfoming nonblocking operations on all types of IO and generally fitting well into a POSIX environment.I would expect that proper support for FFI has to be a high priority as its one of the few obvious pain points remaining.

5430075,0,t3_3pf126,. In my opinion break is preferable to return because it breaks out of the current block meaning that if you have  loops one inside the other using return will break out of both of them.  Additionally break can be used to return a value.  As far as I know this is the idiomatic way to do it.  Where did you hear breaking out of a loop is a bad idea?  Documentation. Sounds like you need a new method that returns values from both of the methods and compares them.. The appropriate way to do this is to either Pass an argument with a meaningful name and execute one of the loops based on an ifelse or create a method to contain each loop that way hitdealer has its own version to call.  The second idea is better because it honors the Single Responsibility PrincipleYou are trying to introduce a Dealer and Dealer is a noun rather than a verb meaning that it is a class rather than a method.  Perhaps it is time to spend some time looking into creating a class to house your methods?

Essentially a doubleentry accounting style ledger that tracks all inventory changes.Depending on your application I would also caution against becoming too attached to the location concept. Inevitably you will have locations as part of your data model but there often end up being nonlocation inventories as well. e.g. Inventory that isnt yet in a location ordered but not received inventory inventory on trucks for delivery inventory in the packing stage etc. Some of these can be modeled as locations but it becomes a cumbersome model that way.,ruby,cxn367m,2,t5_2qh21

Or actually cover?  for ranges the include? method actually checks every element in the range to see if its equal to the argument while cover? just checks the endpoints. With only ten elements in the range it wont make any real performance difference but cover? is better practice when it works properly for a given range always will for a range of integers sometimes wont for ranges of unusual objects. In ruby  can be defined differently for different classes like pretty much every operator for better or worse.  But in idiomatic ruby its usually not even more equal than but more like is a member of the set.     SomeClass  someobj  is the obj a member of the set of all instances of that class    regexp  string   is the string a member of the set of all strings matched by the regexp    range  element  is it in the range    some string  somestring  in this case just boring synonym for  the member of set apply only at a stretch oh well.      One would THINK stdlib Set would do this but it doesnt seem to. The ruby stdlib     is idiosyncratic sometimes oh well.     Set.newsomething  element  NOT is it a member of the set although that would have made senseHowever for Range  is defined as include? rather than cover? something only apparent by looking at the MRI C source and not mentioned in the docs! It probably should be so is a bad choice. It was laziness on my part cover? would be clearer and better youre right! And I think I agree that  isnt implemented consistently enough to be useful and clear and should probably be avoided although its used for case statements whether you like it or not so you cant avoid it completely.

8579367,0,t3_4xa0jg,sqlite is a database just like postgres and mysql but it is not a service  and postgres and mysql are.A service in this context is a computer program that is running all the time communicating with other computer programs over a network such as the Internet or a home wireless network.Services such as postgres and mysql can actually be configured to start automatically when your computer boots. However on some computer setups say a Mac running Homebrew you may need to start them manually or take extra measures to ensure they start on boot.Because sqlite is not a service a sqlite database is managed directly by your computer program without talking over the network. This has the advantage of being much easier to set up but services like postgres and mysql are able to offer much better performance. This is first and foremost because they can be run on entirely separate computers as your computer program. Twice the computers means twice the computing power in this case.,ruby,d6e07h6,3,t5_2qh21

That being said developers might also lean on select technologies when they arent as experienced. I say this because that is what my skills look like as a student developer focusing mostly on Rails and not much outside that realm. Using a few technologies might not work for some people anymore because they have gained experience and have a higher expectation from clientsemployers to deliver quality.

9155856,0,t1_d8cagoe,The former can be a deal braking performance bottleneck.At a development and startup scale performance is rarely an issue. If youre building a tool rather than a product scaling isnt going to be an issue.The problem is that it can be extremely hard to switch from an ORM to a native solution once a product is launched and on the market. Ive seen a number of companies limp along with a bad DB solution throwing hardware at the problem.Unfortunately hardware only gets you so far. Eventually youre running the biggest iron available with FireIO cards and still hit the wall. The further you push with an unscalable solution the harder it is to switch.IMO its much better to spend a little bit of time looking at the long term needs of the product. Where does the company want to go? Do you expect the product to support thousands of concurrent requests? Do you need a SQL database? Can you refactor parts of the product to use other platforms for your nonrelational data?

9645166,0,t1_da1xbj9,Ah maybe Im just adding to the confusion then The gist of it is that Ruby is an Object Oriented programming language. This means that everything is an object. Objects are created from classes which are basically just collections of methods. A text string like Hello World is an object with the class String.    gt myString  Hello World!    gt Hello World!    gt myString.class    gt StringClasses are organised in hierarchies. So we can call the ancestors method on the class to see which classes that class inherits from    gt myString.class.ancestors    gt String Comparable Object Kernel BasicObjectIts perhaps a bit clearer with a number    gt myNum      gt     gt myNum.class    gt Fixnum    gt myNum.class.ancestors    gt Fixnum Integer Numeric Comparable Object Kernel BasicObject So to get to back to the print method when you do    gt print Hello World!    Hello World! gt nil...it is actually calling the method in the current context which is an object that has inherited methods from its ancestors.The print method is inherited from the Kernel class. So you could do the exact same thing this way    gt Kernel.printHello World!    Hello World! gt nil,ruby,da1ysf9,1,t5_2qh21

11284586,0,t3_60w1az,Its interesting to me how different people view different solutions to problems. I see comments on this article where the idea that ruby is backwards is expressed. I feel the same way about Python so I assume its just a personal thing.For example List Comprehensions are the most backwards thing I can possibly imagine. Being a native English speaker having a sentence likeShe and he will go to the mall and maybe we will run into these people I mentioned at the beginning of the sentence who are named Joe and Suzy....is nuts But thats exactly how List Comprehensions read to me.    S  x for x in rangeThe predicate nominative comes before the subject... twice! Its values should be squared it who is a range of . Compare that to ruby    S  ...map|x| xThe range is the subject and then we use pronouns after we know what were dealing with. There is a range of  whos values should be squared.,ruby,dfb3agh,3,t5_2qh21

11488916,0,t1_dfxgphh,I have some question to your questions gt Why not go onerepomultigems?Do you actually know any other large project besides Rails that use it? Sure it solves some dependency problems but on the other hand makes project management on Github kind of more difficult  you just get one giant pile of issues and pull request which is just hard to manage.gt hanami could just provide a boilerplate of the webpack config with a few opinions bundledYou know that not all projects in the world use webpack nor all should right? What about them? Also there is hanamiwebpack gem which I think is going in the direction you suggested. And I feel this is a right way to do. Also I dont think that using HanamiAssets is required by any other component so you could probably just unplug it from your setup.,ruby,dfy9ms3,1,t5_2qh21
11510997,0,t1_dg0q1nv,Again... never said it superseded. One is more clearly targeted at newer developers and specifically around a single language ruby. A general OOP book is definitely going to be more suited to advanced developers.,ruby,dg0rug9,1,t5_2qh21
11514739,0,t3_64cetl,The internal queue solution is described as to use only one database only which would be the same SQL database using transactions. In the references for an example of an internal queue delayedjob is given. Another example would be que which I think has some more sophisticated handling of transactions letting you make changes to other rows in the same transaction as queue operations. I havent used either extensively but que has always seemed very interesting to me. ,ruby,dg173zz,6,t5_2qh21

11733943,0,t1_dgpzeee,Depends on the context. It is very true for named dates I would definitely prefer Date.today.allday over Time.now.allday. On the other hand when you start doing calculations it quickly makes sense. E.g. .days.ago.allday has great readability even though it is a Time object. Converting to Date.today  .days.allday or .days.ago.todate.allday is not an improvement.,ruby,dgq2m2k,1,t5_2qh21
