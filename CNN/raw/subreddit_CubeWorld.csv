610187,0,t1_cg9mcvn,I would argue that most games that are better taking fewer larger releases have enough content and polish to be released outside factors such as promised features aside. Some games that have long times between update include Dwarf Fortress and Kerbal Space Program. The longer development time means both a more stable release and that the people who play the game are satisfied with the content until the next update. Incomplete games cant keep players interested very long and need more frequent releases. Most complete games slow their updates in the interest if stability and because the game is finished enough that rapid updates arent needed to keep the game relevant in its players minds. Older finished games do require more updates to keep more than the most interested players however. ,CubeWorld,cg9mptb,14,t5_2t4bs

This new preview of the quest system shit only made it worse because it shows that Wollay after a year of selling the game still hasnt hired one other employee to help develop the game a little bit quicker.

But nobody who complains has any idea how long it takes to develop a game let alone one as ambitious as this game with such a tiny team. All anyone does anymore is spew hate and insults at wollay and trash on this game. But every single one of them is going to be doing nothing but praising this game when wollay puts it out complete. As for me I still have nothing but hope and time. And if Im wrong so what. Im out  bucks.

Its effectively a lightweight and pretty Dwarf Fortress which is a great combination to bring the genre to the masses.Ive been a supporter of the Kickstarter since day one. Even now two years later it is a long way off from a finished game.  Progress has been consistent but slow. At the current of development Id say they are at least a year away from a finished product.Given that the creators have hired at least  other people to help with the project I can only assume theyve run out of funding by now or are close.

The game that you lost interest in.    gtIts a comment on the way the development marketing and communication could of been handled with an example of a recent successful Alpha campaign.    Yes but unfortunately this game didnt have that type of campaign and its pretty damn late to try bring up this discussion.  Bringing this up WHILE everything is in the dark is probably better than complaining about it AFTER it seems to start making a comeback.  Its like you see someone doing something wrong so you wait until they stop to tell them rather than say Hey thats wrong you should do this.    gtIm sorry youre not interested in discussion feel free to close Reddit and move onto better things.

Which is why were still talking about it when its been years since anything was released.Of course at the current rate its likely someone else will use the same ideas as CW and make a complete finished game probably not voxel style tho long before CW hits ..

10925258,0,t1_de69dk3,Actually the Wii wasnt a failure at all. It dominated the market for a while. It was aimed at families so naturally all the parents bought it for christmas and birthdays for their children and it appealed to gamers and nongamers alike. Also the way it made you physically moved appealed to parents. Literally Sony and Xbox tried to hop on the bandwagon releasing the camera tracking etc to have the same features as the Wii. It was pretty iconic in its time. Anyone I ask has a Wii somewhere in their living room or locked up in storage.The Wii U however can be considered a failure and that is because it WASNT diverse. It had the same name as the Wii and it didnt seem to offer anything really different or interesting like the Wii did.However the Switch is promising. Its a portable and stationary game system all in one. It looks slimmer and more streamline than other systems. They took a risk aiming their demographic to millennials and hopefully thatll pay off for them.Im not that interested in consoles as a PC gamer myself Im just interested in business and marketing. ,CubeWorld,de6v49t,1,t5_2t4bs
