119044,0,t3_1vgcjc,We should really create a sticky thread for this question because it comes up a lot not to fault you OP...itd just save everybody time if we set up a consistent set of answers.Express MX fits slim but the quality isnt great.  Prices get as low as  per with a good sale.Charles Tyrwhitt Extra Slim has great quality but arent as fitted at the waist even at the extraslimfit. They go as low as .HampM is obviously very cheap and not the greatest quality but they sure are slim.BR Tailored Slims are a great fit on slim guys with a bit of muscle.  They drop sub on sale semiregularly and theyve been as low as .Nordstrom s are a boxy slim cut.  Very slim very straight.  Nordstrom sales are rare but they can be had for  when they happen.  Quality is good.Calibrate is slightly more tailored a bit more chest space than s.  Similar quality and pricing.J Crew Factory Slims are a solid pick.  Ive seen them as low as .And of course I cant forget Uniqlo which seems to fit most skinny people pretty well and are priced well though they rarely go on sale.Its impossible to give a single recommendation as to what is best because itll all depend on the subtle differences between shirts that make some fit well and some fit poorly.  For example Im more of an athletic slim  chest  waist and BR tailored slims fit me perfectly and s are too tight in the chest...but for somebody with less chest muscle than me and the same waist the BR would be big up top but the  would fit perfectly.,frugalmalefashion,cerzj8l,36,t5_2s8e9

640873,0,t3_21g3lr,As one of the pessimists but more of a realist imo I think the idea of creating a website very similar to another already great site seems bad. If you dont provide any benefits over the other and you fill an even smaller niche why bother? Massdrop has clothes and plenty of other stuff and theyre doing great. The question you need to solve is why should people use your site over massdrop? I dont care if you believe this can work but what is going to attract people? Facebook vs Myspace facebook was more simple and restricted and tackled ease of use and gained viral popularity. Youre going to need some advantage over massdrop to lure enough customers for group buys. Sample buys arent going to help you in the long run. You need to focus on your companys core strategy. ,frugalmalefashion,cgd4941,1,t5_2s8e9

Going to class wear what ever they hell you want Grab one suit over the summer for orientation if you want to but a lot of people show up in just a dress shirt and chinos for that anyways.  Start looking but dont feel like you have to have a full new wardrobe by the start of the year.  You should have a suit by the spring semester so you have it for interviews for summer internships and depending on your internship you might need to wear one everyday im interning at the public defenders office so i do.  I know this probably isnt the response you are looking for but unless you want to be labeled as a gunner theres no reason to suit up every day.

However I have not been happy with the feel of the fabrics particularly for regular cotton shirts. It is quite thin and not very soft. The oxfords I have are ok though they are pretty similar to Uniqlo oxfords. Uniqlos fabric is slightly softer though. Pants  Newport chinos are actually quite nice. They make great summer chinos since the fabric is soft and not too heavy. These are considered slim straight.

3317081,0,t1_cp6clxv,Lol no Im far from the only one. Id send myriads more but Im on mobile. Just search Corter on mfa. Theres many posts about it. Heres how it played out. I order two belts. One black one brown in . The site said items will ship in a week if theyre stock items for I cant remember the terminology as it was over a year ago items he had to make it was  weeks. I assumed since the belts were in normal size and normal color they fell in the first category of shipping in a week. It didnt say anywhere on the site that they fell into the  week category which is whatever. So after maybe  days I emailed him for a status update hey man I was just wondering if I could get an update on the belts. His response was Per the email you just responded to it will take  to  weeks. I thought that was a pretty douchey answer since it was an honest question and it wasnt clear in the email but I just let go and waited. Now were at four weeks and still nothing so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and waited until week five. At this point I was pretty annoyed because I havent heard anything and he was a dick about it in the first place so I sent an email that said hey any updates on when my belts will ship? And he never replied to that one. Now Ive been waiting for six weeks total and still nothing. I emailed him again and he responded this time saying that they just shipped everything out so I should have gotten a notice they shipped a week ago. I told him I didnt. He said that hell get them out soon. He didnt apologize for the extra two week wait or for not shipping them or ignoring my first email. I finally after  weeks and a few days got the belts. The belts are ridiculously rigid and about half an inch thick. The point of belts is that theyre so supposed to contour to your body to hold your pants up. These dont bend or flex at all. After about a month the black one and brown had both lost a rivet so I had to take a rivet out of the black one to wear the brown one. It was a fucking joke. Almost  weeks  dollars and the belts not only made it look like I had a permaboner because of how thick the leather is but I also have to dick around with the rivets. Rather than bother with their garbage customer service I just went back to wearing a three year old shitty gap belt which still works just fine and cost half as much. Fuck Corter.

4049809,0,t1_crhu6wh,Physique is much more important than height in determining fit chest and shoulders especially. On top of that theres also the matter of body proportions e.g. long torso. Im    and a small regular not slim definitely fits me best at both J.Crew and Uniqlo.

Every time I save myself an hour lets say making  straps I shave  off my costs so about  per strap.  I mean I could keep that difference but Im not trying to be Walmart.

Not everything in clearance is a final sale item and the code works either way.Ill also note that one of the best things about JCF is that the sizing is pretty consistent.  It may be the biggest reason I shop there because its rare for something to not fit in my standard size and thats rarely true elsewhere.

5115274,0,t3_3l1wu5,Yay for Ugmonk! Its a great company and Jeff Sheldon has a lot of really cool designs.Couple things though. Its not a new brand its just not very known yet. Theyve been around for  years selling those simple qualityfocused shirts and books and bags. It is a fantastic brand though.. This sale is once per year at best. Ugmonk rarely has fullon sales like this. Take advantage of it!. Fit is somewhat trim but not tight. Im  and  lbs and a Medium fits me well. Not too big not too slim.And theyre supper comfortable items. Great feel on your body. Screen printing isnt that plasticy stuff either  very smooth very clean feel as a whole.. Coupon codes dont stack. Sorry. So the  off code is a best bet. Ive got several of those so PM me if you want one.Oh and their sweatshirts are absolutely incredible.The designer graduated from the college Im currently going to. I love his company vision read this! he just creates stuff HE would want to wear focusing on good design and quality and all of his designs are really catchy and neat.So yeah. Glad to see someone else bringing attention to this brand. Get stuff from Ugmonk!,frugalmalefashion,cv2kygf,1,t5_2s8e9

5207649,0,t1_cvdk0p5,The seconds issue with the walnut Fifth Aves could be that the shoe was lasted incorrectly so it fits tighter than its .D brethren. Thats completely speculation but explains the problems youre finding.As for the Presidios its a different last so theres no guarantee that youll wear the same size in that as the Fifth Aves or any other shoe. Also that pinching and folding under and above the strap probably wasnt present until the shoe started being stitched up and burnished. Even if it was I suspect in their business model that they still make a small profit on seconds so its more cost effective to make a pair of seconds and be able to sell that bad piece of leather than just discard it.,frugalmalefashion,cvdppj9,0,t5_2s8e9

5920161,0,t1_cxvnksy,Depends how often you wear suits. Wear a  suit everyday you want half canvas for durability so suitsupply is a great choice. Its a  entry fee but the value makes it the frugal choice.  Wear a suit x a year for weddings and such you can go with a fused suit as you dont need the durability and can be more frugal. I really like j crew factorys worsted wool suit. It has a cut that is very flattering to most people on this sub.  In general you want a  wool suit. Worsted wool is a good choice in a basic color like navy or charcoal. Fit is king in the chest and shoulders as you normally can get sleevesif nonfunctional buttons and waist tailored.

I have not taken them out to wear yet and they still have their tags attached to the garments.More information measurements product details etc on the Reigning Champ website can be found here The retail price according to the website is  CAD. To ship to the US is an extra  CAD which would be  USD. It is a tagged size large but fits a slim medium very well.Likewise more information on the Apolis Coated Chore coat can be found here The retail price is . Measurements and more details can also be found on the website. This will come with the Apolis canvas bag that was given to me when I bought this product from their website. This fits a TTS medium.The final piece I have for sale is my ILoveUgly Black Parka from the  line up. Its a size medium which also fits very slim. I wore it for about a month before I decided I dont have use for it. I live in Seattle and it is often very wet here. I prefer to wear my other jackets over this one even though I love the custom little details that wear done on this piece. Cordlined hood custom buttons inside design inside pocket small fishtail etc. This was purchased at retail for .

Grailed post for those who use it.As of now I will only be shipping to CONUS via USPS. Expect a tracking number within  days of sending payment. Prices are quite firm but feel free to make an offer. Please dont try to lowball me. I wont accept ridiculous offers such as  for the sweatshirt or  for the chore coat. I am quite reasonable I believe but these are good prices for the pieces youre getting.

Im usually between medium and large for a lot of clothes  I should have been right on the line based on their measurements for the blazer I picked up but the large was so snug that I didnt even bother trying on the medium.  Also theres a  inch drop not really sure on the term so if you go with a  jacket youd get  inch pants.

Most people also want loafers to fit a bit more snugly especially if theyre going to be worn sockless.  My feeling is that the . would be the right size for you but Im not at full confidence for the recommendation.  They dont seem to offer a lot of loafers on wider lasts for some reason.

9402133,0,t1_d97rpbf,Yes and Shinola has a factory headquarters? in Detroit and they are a part of the face of the revitalization of downtown Detroit. It is a part of city pride for a lot of people and they really like the company for putting money into the city. On the other hand they are criticized as not just overpriced watches but also faking their made in Detroit heritage because they are really only assembled in Detroit using watch movements from overseas. By many they are seen as a cheap fashion watch brand taking advantage of people who want to see Detroit come back. There are also very strong feelings that companies like Shinola and the city government for that matter are putting on a revitalized facade with new buildings businesses and walkable areas in Detroits downtown while the rest of the city and the surrounding suburbs are still in very rough shape.So yeah they are incredibly popular in the area and also very controversial. The company is seen as either an answer to prayers for the city or a deceptive conartist preying on people who think they are helping the city. ,frugalmalefashion,d97sc3f,12,t5_2s8e9

10499870,0,t3_5q3be5,MakerModel Red Wing Postman Sand Suede Japanese exclusive  model  Size Leather Sand Suede RoughoutSole Cushion crepe solePrice  shippedWearsCondition Brand newImages grailed linkNotes  For sale is a brand new unworn pair of the Japanese exclusive sand suede postman oxfords style no. . I bought these originally from unionmade for  shipped. These have been sitting in my closet for about  months now I have just tried them on never worn outside. They have a unique foot cushionstabilizer on the medial inside of each shoe. I have researched online but have found no information on this and it is exclusive to this specific RW shoe model to my knowledge. After trying them on it appears to be there to make the shoe more comfortable with wear regardless it is completely unique and not featured on normal postmans. These shoes are absolute tanks. They have a super thick lined fullgrain roughout not split suede leather upper durable cushion crepe sole and all the robust construction you expect from a Red Wing Heritage shoe. I have another pair of postmans as my daily grinders black suede and they are hands down the most comfortable shoes I own after about a month of breaking in. The postmans were originally made for postal workers who needed a comfortable durable service shoe that they could wear for a full  hour work day. I assume this will be even more comfortable than standard postmans as it has the foot stabilizer. Please know your Red wing sizing before ordering as I will not accept returns.

At the very least you would know how much you get beforehand. eBates even has a coupon finder like Honey in their extension now if thats something you want.gtIt isnt like an obnoxious pop up or anythingI found the popup at checkout is rather annoying because it never found coupons.

11124382,0,t1_des58wd,Ive had my wallet for almost  years now. I use it every day and its gotten accidentally soaked before but continues to hold up beautifully to this day. With regards to your problem Ill experience it the most when I remove  cards or more on any given side which is rare but the leather tends to reshape within  hours. I keep my personal identification health cards on one side  and creditdebit cards on other side . This is my configuration about  of the time give or take some cash so I feel the wallet has adjusted to it nicely. Sometimes Ill add a temporary card that I have to use for the day which will fit snugly and after removal the pocket may feel a little looser but within  hours go back to normal and I dont have to worry about slippage anymore. I used to carry probably  cards on both sides before finally realizing it defeated the slim purpose. After sizing down there was a temporary issue of loose cards but for maybe a week max. No permanent issues just make sure you keep consistency with what you carry.,frugalmalefashion,desxtuo,2,t5_2s8e9

11399289,0,t1_dfo2h2v,Im not sure what you mean by limited world view.  Obviously Uniqlo isnt the only one that does it.  However this is the only company Ive come across that has said it will leave the market completely if they are forced to pay the tariff or manufacture in the US.     I  understand the dynamics of textiles and the industry.  It truly is sad to see workers exploited in this manner.  Maybe im getting older and more conscious about things like this who knows.  What strikes me is Uniqlos arrogance here.  To be fair the wages some of these people make are probably exponentially greater than they would have if not for that particular job.  I think we need to parse the article a bit though the head of Uniqlo didnt say anything this is the head of their parent company that owns among other things Uniqlo and I presume has many other importing business within the US.  Hes saying that if hes forced to pay the tax manufacture in the US he will pull all his business including Uniqlo because according to the article you cant make really good products in the us at cost beneficial to the costumers.  Not only is that completely false  but its this kind of corporate thinking that values profits over human value.  At some point ethics have to come into play.  You can continue to purchase their products..  but I wont. but thats my opinion and right.  ,frugalmalefashion,dfo3f9s,1,t5_2s8e9

Varying from dressy to very casualworkboot style from cheap to very pricy at the Alden shell cordovan levelRed Wing  Iron Rangers Mocs and Beckmans are great bets depending on what you want in style. More casualworkboot style but generally very good quality especially with Red Wing owning the tanneryAllen Edmonds  Higgins Mill Dalton First Ave are good bets on the casual to dressy side.

11750162,0,t3_67nxea,I tried a pair of these on instore once and they were so janky and looked nothing like they do online at least in my opinion. ,frugalmalefashion,dgrws4k,5,t5_2s8e9
11753440,0,t3_67obb4,Selling a pair of size D Allen Edmonds Cavanaugh loafers in walnut. Purchased these shoes on eBay and wore them around for a day before I had to come to the conclusion they were just too big for me. They are in excellent condition easily  and have plenty of life in the soles as you can see from the pictures. Box shoe bags and shoe trees are not included. Feel free to ask any questions if interested. Asking  shipping included. Will ship USPS priority mail anywhere in the US. Album here ,frugalmalefashion,dgsa5qp,1,t5_2s8e9

Very slim so easy to slide in your skinny jeans pocketsIts also picked up a nice patina from being handled.  mine  all of their optionsJust thought id leave another option here since if you go with Shell Cordovan you still will be paying around  with the discount anyways,frugalmalefashion,dgswqxu,-6,t5_2s8e9
