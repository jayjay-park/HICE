4573344,0,t1_ct70s9g,That being the case and that its been over a year I dont really see how you would expect a free replacement to be a fair solution. Tungsten is a naturally brittle metal it happens. Doesnt really matter where you buy your ring that will always be a risk. The title of your post makes it sound like you blame the jeweler for the quality of the ring though. No need to start a witch hunt. Like upleasureincontempt saidgt matter can be hard and brittle OR soft and pliable but cannot be bothampnbspThe manager may have been a bit smug but it sounds like you were acting a bit entitled. Their lack of sympathy and poor business practices are another matter altogether... ,barrie,ct72v8p,2,t5_2scn1

6278414,0,t3_41k833,Copeland Forest is a crown land forest in Oro Medonte right near Horseshoe Valley road. The entrance is off Ingram Rd clearly marked with a parking lot.  There are no motorized vehicles allowed so in the winter its hikers snow shoeing and cross country skiing. Its a  hectare property with kilometres and kilometres of trails. Its dog friendly and theres a sign to keep your dog on a leash but its kind of just common knowledge that everyone lets their dogs off back there.  Only slightly downside to the whole property is that its multi recreational use so hunting and guns are permitted on the land during hunting seasons. I live near it and I go there ALL the time with my dogs. Any time Ive seen a hunter they are very courteous and respect that there is a lot of different activities going on. They usually dont wander the main trails and mostly they are bird hunters so theyre in the wet lands anyways. You do hear the occasional gun shot in the distance.  Its really a beautiful large forest and I love going there. ,barrie,cz3a9ud,1,t5_2scn1

7054075,0,t3_4c7uak,What kind of camping experience are you looking for ? Aside from the whole sleeping in a tent thing. Will you have kids with you ? Is your trip more focused on nature ? Close to amenities? Looking for a campground with more action  younger crowd who like to party at night or somewhere thats more quiet and relaxing ? Awenda is good for nature and relaxing. Typical provincial park. Theres a bunch of private campgrounds in Wasaga beach area that are close to beach and action  dining. If thats your thing.On a side note  Bruce peninsula is amazing. The grotto is really neat.  Make sure you go before am or there s a line up of cars to get in the park and not guaranteed. They only let a number of people in.  ,barrie,d1fxsi2,3,t5_2scn1
