4638972,0,t1_ctfavw5,Article  Section C of the Constitution lays out the structure and formation of Supply Days clearlyiii The Order Paper will be determined by the Opposition House Leader or a suitable facsimile on days which have been earmarked as Supply Days also known as Opposition Days.iv Supply Days shall be allotted a rate of one supply day per week to a maximum of six  supply days per month.v The Opposition may request the addition of a Supply Day from the floor and it may be added to the calendar upon approval from the House.vi Supply Days will be determined through discussion between the Opposition Leader Opposition House Leader and the Prime Minister and Government House Leader should the four be unable to reach an agreed upon date the Supply Day shall be allotted to the nearest day no later than one  week since the last Supply Day.To the best of my knowledge a supply day has not been allotted or recognizedagreed upon by the leadership of the House. If this is not the case then the motion would meet the conditions of a supply day motion but would still fail to meet Article  Section C Subsection ii In order to move a piece of legislation it must be added to the Order Paper. The proposed legislation must have a mover and seconder who will both affirm this status to the Speaker of the House. A Motion of Notice wherein the Speaker is made aware of intent to table the bill must be made a minimum of one  day before the Bill is tabled.Since I am not Speaker I cannotwill not rule the motion out of order but the rules seem to be against the motion proceeding at the moment. Alternatively uzhantongz is first in the order paper if he has agreed to provide you his slot on the roster it would address one problem. But it would still need to be given notice to the Speaker and the Speaker would need to confirm the swap.,cmhocdebate,ctfb65x,1,t5_35i0f
