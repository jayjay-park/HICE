93837,0,t3_1v69l1,It does look a bit low but I cant tell for sure without a picture from the side. Or draw up a quick diagram where its pierced. The stretching of ur piercing isnt happening due to the weight of the jewelry. Its probably just a bit sore from smashing a needle and a piece of metal down your nose. If you really wanna know for sure just go to ur local piercer or a different one. Theres only so much Internet people can do in such a case. ,bodymods,cep43hf,6,t5_2qj5t

2775696,0,t1_cnj41hs,gt Its pretty much common knowledge to wait  months after piercing to allow for full healing...It is in the US? Here in germany not a single studio will tell you to wait more then  weeks if you want to start stretching  weeks to change the piercing itself only and we dont have any problems with it so far.gt Probably wouldnt have gotten a blowout but you did cause damage to your ear.I did not trust me. My ear never had any cuts blowouts catbutts or even blood on it while stretching. The only problem i actually ran into was stretching when we had C outside and the sweat made it feel weird thats all.gt Its easier to have a minimum than guess if your ears are healed and end up forcing it.The thing is when your ears dont hurt anymore even when you move the expander for example any movement not just spinning it around and they are not red or anything when you take the expander out for cleaning you are pretty much ready for the next step. Either the next expander goes in just fine without any force or it doesnt Thats pretty much the only guidline people should follow because its based on each individual healing process.gt Besides how is waiting a little longer screwing up? Better than going too fast.Not exactly. There can actually be alot of problems when stretching extremly slow that are mostly based on people playing around with unhealed stuff tho. A friend for example took  months to go from mm to mm because his ear completly healed and the cicatricial tissue made him unable to get a bigger expander in at all He had do simply buy steelplugs amp wait which still took  months with them in . Its true that you should wait till everything is fine but overwaiting and messing around with it can fuck you up big time too. Again it really depends ly on the persons healing ability and skin.gt Post some naked ear pics I wanna see how healthy your lobes are. No catbutt?Sure. I actually even do productmodel shots for plugs from time to time too. This here was at mm freshly stretched from mm new pierced after  weeks only. And for you and probably tons of other wait X months users i just took new photos of my current mm which took me  days from mm to mm which you can see not perfectly round because of antiform plugs right now tho and a bit red from wearing steel to long here ,bodymods,cnjl4lf,1,t5_2qj5t

This is even slower than regular stretching but I was able to keep the bottom from getting any thinner and move the hole a little higher in my ear lobe.  I think I was around  inch when I did this maybe th.   To make the teardrop take a plug that is say  or  sizes smaller thats the base then get something that a lot smaller like g or g and wrap them together with clean teflon tape.

6096502,0,t3_3z1xm6,Honestly who cares what people think? If you like the look rock it. A lot of elitist assholes on here will judge you hardcore for it. But I say fuck em. If you want to wear something wear it. If someone with mods judges you for wearing a faux piercing then they are a hypocrit they sure as hell dont like being judged.

6361027,0,t1_czav7cf,Thats so awesome! I want to repierce my naval but idk. The first time I pierced it I bought a sterile piercing kit online and did it myself. It turned out really good until my mom made me take it out. She took me to the doctors thinking it was infected... Even the doctor was sorta impressed I pierced it myself and it wasnt infected. The healing process for any piercing is something you should take into consideration but it shouldnt stop you. Whatever decision anyone makes on a body mod should be made carefully and truthfully. ,bodymods,czcof27,2,t5_2qj5t

6638087,0,t3_46kb2h,gtcan I remove them all and get them back in easily say after an hour or ?I have zero experience with penis piercings ... Im a girl but with most of the other piercings yes you can take them out for a while and they wont close immediately. be wary however that if you keep them out long enough but more like a few days they will shrink a bit  so then putting the old jewelry back will make it sore for some days and wont be as easy,bodymods,d05xo5h,2,t5_2qj5t

7650512,0,t3_4k19v9,Your best bet is going to be finding APP piercers and getting friendly with them. Heavy mods are a real grey area and most piercers arent going to straight up talk about it to anyone. The actual process is going to entirely depend on your anatomy and what you want out of the process. Healing will also depend on a lot of things. These would be things to talk about with the person specifically doing these mods.,bodymods,d3btk1o,1,t5_2qj5t
7657861,0,t1_d3cm0rp,I know but I was hoping I could get a white tattoo that had this similar look. I personally think white ink like this looks more appealing on darker skin. Kind of like how dark colors look more appealing on paler skin in my opinion. I like the contrast between the colors. ,bodymods,d3cnmbp,2,t5_2qj5t

9351895,0,t3_58lifc,Well Ive had a few piercing but no tattoos so maybe Im not entirely qualified to say. But what I think is a piercing is a long build up and then a short intense pain some are obviously more intense than others. However a tattoo is more drawn out so it shouldnt be as scary if that makes sense? Those reactions you had were likely due to your body responding to stress and adrenalin. If theres not that whole oh my god oh my god here comes the needle moment as there is with getting a piercing Id imagine your bodys response would be less extreme. But everyone is different!,bodymods,d91f4yx,5,t5_2qj5t

10183645,0,t3_5lt93z,For smaller gauges your best bet is probably some kind of shortterm biocompatible plastic tubing. Ask your piercer which option they stockrecommend or see if friends at a hospital can hook you up with surgical tubing of the correct diameter. Cut a piece stick male or threadless ends on and youre good to go!The catch with plastics is that even the surgical ones leach chemicals when worn at body temp for a long time which can be avoided by replacing them every couple weeks. Id be especially wary of smalldiameter glass jewelry in a profession that risks getting punched in the face occasionally... Thank you for your service!,bodymods,dbydf5e,6,t5_2qj5t
