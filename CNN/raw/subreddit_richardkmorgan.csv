2170167,0,t3_2jtvsq,I liked it a lot and was fairly satisfied by the ending.  I loved the whole bit about how being a god is terribly difficult.  Then they finish off that setup by having Jhiral take back Archedis slavelover.  I was wondering how they were going to wrap that up with her being so adamant about not wanting to be queen and I found it quite satisfying.  I was left wondering when I got to the part about Hjels birth.  Am I correct in thinking that it turns out Ringel dressed up as dakovachspelling? and saved Hjel?  I just dont understand how that is important.  So we have ringils first meeting with Hjel when Hjel has already met him.  Then we have Hjels first meeting with Ringil where Ringil has already met him.  Now we have Ringil going back in time to save Hjel at birth and on top of all that confusion he dressed up as dakovach?  Also what was with him biting the ravens friend?  ,richardkmorgan,clfoggb,5,t5_2s5e7
