7680270,0,t1_d3ewu6y,Pi should be almost independent of dimensions. It appears in any dimension greater than  quite often. Its neat that you found a good approximation but I find it hard to believe it represents something physical.,TheoreticalPhysics,d3f788m,2,t5_2uge2
9465026,0,t1_d9fr87s,Any finite stretching is fine but dimension is a topological property. By definition if you dont conserve it it isnt a homeomorphism.,TheoreticalPhysics,d9frbqm,1,t5_2uge2
11265100,0,t1_dc3ln7a,I agree. Not being a scientist or physicist but having read a large amount of books on theoretical physics I have found there sometimes appears a fine line between philosophy and physics and some of the accepted ideas in modern physics began as extremely odd ideas bouncing around in someones head. So I would not try to filter any reasonable query or idea.  No one forces anyone to give them any attention.The only change I would like to see is more AMAs.   Hopefully some knowledgeable people will volunteer for this. ,TheoreticalPhysics,df8vse6,1,t5_2uge2
