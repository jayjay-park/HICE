4834,0,t1_ceeza53,Thats quite an exaggeration by them then. Sure it was a disappointment because people expect so much more but that does not mean its a very bad game. If it was a completely new game with a different name by a different game company everybody would be saying now that its not bad but its very limited its just that expected more that its gonna get a load of shit.So out of the thousands of games that have came out this year this Yahtzee site or whatever thinks Simcity is the th worst? Its nowhere near close to that.Its like when people say the new Star Wars movies are some of the worst movies ever made. Well of course theyre not theyre still good its just that they dont stand up to the older staw wars movies by far. ,SimCity,ceezk5e,-18,t5_2ryr3

With that already in place and just a port from one language to the other its much simpler.This is what I am thinking... the design phase and logistics testing phase is the long part of the process.  Once you have worked through the kinks of exactly how you want something to work and make sure your processes dont conflict with each other what language you write that in is fairly trivial.  Much like building a city really... once you have figured out the traffice and layout of all your zones which could take weeks or months to really get down you could erase the whole thing and redraw all the streets and zones again pretty easily in a matter of hours using.  ,SimCity,cepmo24,1,t5_2ryr3

Over the year and a half or so yeah its gotten better.. but that is standard.. expected nothing to garner pats on the back. It is still woefully flawed everywhere for any kind of serious level of play. The layer maps are a shining star but even those have a very inconsistent barcolumn function.. lets say  units shows as an inch high escape out to zone then back into layer.. same bar shows a  value  inch high If you were none the wiser you would have not known of an increase and actually assumed a decrease for example.

1100099,0,t3_26p7fi,Noob question.How do you guys get the rampsfeeder roads attached to raised highwaysoverpasses? If thats what Im seeing? Again NOOB! but Ive figured out how to make a raised road nm keys and connect it to other FLAT roads but I cant then cause another road to be connected to any of the raised part rampstyle. Does this require a mod?Take pity on me. Ive also searched for tutorials but for example my results here At first glance it looks like a lot of relevant hits but in reality a lot of them have to do with other building aspects or do not refer to SimCity . This is the closest and still doesnt show how to get a raised road with a RAISED connecting roadrampThanks in advance.  ,SimCity,chtc4f9,1,t5_2ryr3

1158493,0,t1_chzx0us,Nope.  The tool of choice ended up being SimCityPak by rOppie.Even in our work with Maxis on a mod level they have used SimCityPak and helped make it more robust to be honest with Oppie by helping with various aspects.Since Oppie was ahead of Maxis on actually having something functional I think it was a decision to help make that or improve that tool for the community vs making an SDK in the normal sense.But there is a level of unknown when it comes to many aspects of even how maxis would create and do things within the game or for the game.Maps for example were and are something that can take  weeks to develop due to the nature of how they are actually created and what is involved.There is no Internal Map Tool. There is a process which I only understand part of with Maya and how they use the UV and BMPs to get textures and effects to work correctly in the game.  The process of creating content was complicated on the Maxis side and we are trying to simplify it now on our side in the community but it still is not as simple as most would think.I myself was diving in with the latest version of DS  and since its so new I do not have the ability to export to a format that is supported yet myself on my end for modeling in the normal sense.So again .. more time is needed to bring more people into the modding groups and help create the custom buildings and content users wish to have.,SimCity,chzy501,0,t5_2ryr3

3043747,0,t3_2v0vk1,Personally SimCity  failed by alwaysonline DRM then the big hooha over single player which they ended up adding months after launch. The old SimCitys were good because you could play them offline and SimCity  was great due to the modding community and for me it was the road missions. SimCity  has small cities BUT the megatowers make up for that. And its different to SimCity  and before.Cities XXL on the other hand is basically a slightly updated version of Cities XL. New engine and less lag? Yeah right.Cities XL Platinum being my first game of the series it was okay. But when they decide to pop out what alot of people call an update  patch on Cities XL and renamed then well yeah. Did they even put the effort in? Did they bother to reinvent it like they did for SimCity? Dont think so.So I think Cities XXL is the bigger flop here as there is marginally small differences to the previous version.Cities XXL has been out for a day. The company behind it hasnt responded to anything so all I can say is give it some time and if nothings changed in a couple of weeks then Cities XXL is the worst,SimCity,codhf63,6,t5_2ryr3

3788184,0,t1_cqnjhnb,Doesnt that mean I just sacrifice the st city? Also I dont like supporting universities as theyre just too slow to warrant all that money and space that I could have used for a wind farm or a trade Centre. And what about design? Thats what I wanted to know more about. I want it to look like a spectacle. There was this one video I saw a long time ago of an older simcity game where the up loader had made the city spread out in the form of circles. I thought it was really beautiful. Thats what I want to achieve a city that not only functions well but also doesnt look like a recovered warzone. ,SimCity,cqo304m,2,t5_2ryr3

4374297,0,t3_3b3q7s,Its pointless to jump on some random server and try to play. Half the cities will already be abandoned by their players and the other half will get abandoned within  days often in a very incomplete state making the other cities useless to you. Also its based on the idea of cities helping each other out which typically doesnt happen. Everyone is just building independently and not communicating at all.If you have some friends or family to play with I guess it can be pretty fun. However multiplayer is still too limited. You can only view static snapshots of the other peoples cities. Also you cant for example build a mining city and then trade resources with anothers manufacturing city  you can only manually gift resources or sell them on the global market which is just a resource sink. That really defeats the purpose of city specializations IMO. You could manually set up a scheme where one guy gifts you Ore and you promise to gift him money in return but that would be extremely tedious.The last issue is that the servers might close down at some point in the nottoo distant future. Maxis has been shut down and the very last patch they made allows you to transfer your online cities into the offline mode. Once EA pulls the plug SimCity will become a singleplayer only game as theres no way to set up your own server.,SimCity,csipw60,5,t5_2ryr3

4576540,0,t1_ct73xua,Nah I agree with kylezo gt  is my favorite especially for realism. Better atmosphere better architecture better graphics feels more like a living city. Doesnt get more realistic than rampant homeless dudes visibly running around your city.  was just more realistic and far more fun and Skylines fails to immerse me in the same way that all the actual SimCity games did.  is the only one that actually feels like a real city rather than managing a database.,SimCity,ct7han4,-3,t5_2ryr3

5233130,0,t3_3mnic1,Education is weird.  I can usually get my cities to tech level  and then they start losing their tech level.  Doesnt matter if I add more colleges or how many students.  I even had a city with a University that was full and three colleges and was down to tech level .  Industry kept complaining about unskilled workers.  So I stick a college right in the industrial park.  Students are showing up but industry around still keeps closing.  At that point I just closed every college and brought down Industry taxes to  with the savings.  Maybe they were just shitty places to work and students left town after graduating heh.Also created a low density town  pop that was  in the green per hour and over a million in the coffers.  The town just ran itself and I could leave it run on cheetah for hours while I did other things.  Was teaching  of the students in town except the  waterfront mansions that kept complaining about missing school.  Even stuck school bus stops in front of their houses and they were still too dumb to just get on the bus when it came to their doors.,SimCity,cvgs6np,3,t5_2ryr3

6067318,0,t1_cyef6la,well its hard to say with the info you have given.  I have found that you need to really think about how you plan the town and also you have to keep an eye on not only the RCI greenblueyellow demand but also on the amount of workers and unemployed that you have as your town evolves.  Education is very important to keeping crime down and you always have to find ways to make traffic move smoothly.  Grow slowly and always try to keep your budget in the green at least until you really ramp up your manufacturing and start basically printing money.  You have to keep your sims happy as well.  Scatter some parks around get transit going if traffic is piling up.  Just so many variables but keep in mind that the game itself has bugs and sometimes problems will arise.Gambling towns are tough.  Even a successful town will have swings in budget when you are making money hand over fist and then you are in the red...then back in the green and back in the red.  The money coming in is erratic.,SimCity,cyewzmh,1,t5_2ryr3

6818756,0,t3_48q0sk,To be honest I never understood why EA just didnt make a morepolished SimCity  called it SimCity  and called it a day.I say this as SC  its expansion  all the mods ever made for it was a pretty sweet city sim game for its time  and that was  years ago.So in my personal opinion the only way EA would get me back on board seriously especially from Cities Skylines which satisfies most of my citysim desires but clearly not ALL of them would be to start there.Then if they somehow were able to add in the networking functionalities added in the network mods including the enhancements from SC Ill admit I love me some curved roads thatd be nice.Also make the resource micromanagement an OPTION. While it adds a nice level of realism to be frankly honest its an utter pain sometimes to deal with.Oh and make changing the colors of the menu backgrounds and text easier or more intuitive. My eyesight stinks and if I could just make that one change itd be amazing.All in all EA has the formula they need. I think the reason SC bombed so horribly is because just like Societies they tried to make SimCity a thing it wasnt. I dont blame them for trying  the fanbase just didnt want it. So in reality if a SC were to come out EA would really need to follow the fundamental SimCity formula at least at the base level and not deviate too far from it for fans to buy in and for the game to be a financial success.,SimCity,d0p7dfx,2,t5_2ryr3
