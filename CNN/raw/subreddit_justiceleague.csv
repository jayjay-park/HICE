1420639,0,t1_ciuaf5e,Not particularly... If youve read other grant Morrison you know how strange it can get although his JLA run is admittedly tame for him. I recently went back and reread all of the  JLA run and none of it is really like the cartoon so your question is a toughie. That being said I think a lot of the comics are much higher quality than the cartoon which always felt limited to me by their animation budget and young target audience. Maybe take some time and read one of those top ten lists and youll probably find that you enjoy the comics a lot too. ,justiceleague,ciucsd0,2,t5_2rqpm

3028942,0,t3_2scnww,This whole movie was garbage and it felt like a rushed first draft script that needed extensive rewrites and polishing. The only thing I liked was the art and animation. Here are all the issues I had with it First off its way too short. It has a run time of just over an hour. The movie needed a lot more time to develop characters and let the story breath Aquamans switch from normal dude to superhero happens almost instantaneously. One minute hes getting beat up by a bunch of bar thugs and the next minute hes going toe to toe with elite Atlantean troops and summoning sea creatures. Orm aka. Ocean Master is WAY too powerful in this. He singlehandedly takes on the Justice League and beats them around multiple times in this movie. The Trident of Poseidon isnt that powerful folks and Orm has always been more of a plotter and schemer hes not Doomsday. What the hell is Black Manta doing? Hes given no backstory or motivation and seems to be tacked on just because. Speaking of enemies this just didnt feel epic enough. When Atlantis attacks Metropolis there are like what a couple hundred troops and  tanks? How the hell are they going to take over a single city much less the entire world with such a small force? At least in the JL show they had a plot to flood the planet and seemed more of a threat. Atlantis just seemed small and weak in this movie IMO The Justice League is really stupid in this movie. They all Batman included seem to make bad decisions and are just generally outclassed. I think a big part of this is because the villains they need to fight are so weak in this that the writers needed to dumb down and power down the JL.I could go on. If they wanted to do this right they just should have had a stand alone Aquaman movie made it  minutes longer and polished the story up some. They could have had the JL show up at the end to help but it should have been solely an Aquaman movie. This is by far the worst DC Animated movie Ive watched so far and Ive seen them all.,justiceleague,coby4b3,1,t5_2rqpm

7026592,0,t3_4bs014,Okay a few questions here spoilers belowspoilers We have to wonder just what the hell did that wacky Lex Luthor mean by this statement? The Bell Has Been Rung Especially when the camera then cuts to the painting in his fathers room showing the devil rising from a fissure in the Earth in context of what Lex said Devils dont come from the Earth below they come from the sky . Now recall the vision Batman had in the batcave with the post nuclear war with BatSoldiers and SupermanSoldiers as well as a Lex Corp truck. At the END of that sequence we see a lightning storm inside the batcave and someones face warning Bruce about Lex. Batman awakes as IF from a dream but...look what was in that vision. He saw monstrous flying creatures could these be Parademons? Could the warning figure in the mask be The Flash who somehow time traveled to get a message to avert that nightmare future? Lex said Hes coming for us that sounds like Darkseid to me. But...how does he KNOW about him then? Was he working for him all along? Did he learn it from the Kryptonian ship?,justiceleague,d1ctfrq,5,t5_2rqpm
7551667,0,t3_4irfqe,Exactly. It should also allow for more creative freedom. They can keep what works and scrap what doesnt without compromising the whole universe. Just makes business sense to me. And rumor has it even Marvels Kevin Feige wishes their shows werent connected to their cinematic universe.EDIT Plus they already have the multiverse established if they want to try a crossover eventually.,justiceleague,d30l747,6,t5_2rqpm
9416218,0,t3_59jib1,I gotta echoed everyones sentiments with Young Justice. I think it even does a lot of stuff better than the Timmverse. A lot of the animated movies are worth checking out too. Batman Under the Red Hood Wonder Woman Justice League Crisis on Two Earths Green Lantern First Flight and Justice League New Frontier are among the best. I dont think any of the New  movies have been great but they have great designs and action so they still have some merit. ,justiceleague,d99kkkf,2,t5_2rqpm
