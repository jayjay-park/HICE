His mind begins to race as he draws another three arrows from his quiver this time aiming at the rain of boulders upon him. Fire. Three boulders down. Yasaki leaps to the side to escape the rest of the rocks but he had wasted too much time destroying the first three. He feels his ribs cracking and howls in pain as the boulders come crashing into him.He was in trouble now he couldnt hold back any longer. Yasaki begins moving around the field with his superior agility readying an arrow while Sweeney comprehends his movements. Steadying his breath and timing his shot very carefully Yasaki fires an arrow to the underside of Sweeneys knee at one of the weakest parts of the body.

187444,0,t1_cezs409,Orville    Orville and Albert continue to build the wall. Together they harvest and shape stone and assemble it to protect the well. Orville periodically tests the walls strength with his cane at one point knocking over a small portion of it. He tunnels away for a bit leaving Albert to repair it and returns with mud from the river which the duo use as a much more effective adhesive substance. This continues for quite some time. Multiple uses are made of Orvilles saw cane and even screwdriver when dealing with minor bits of structural excess using it as an improvised pick. More than once Orville thinks to himself that this would be easier if he still had the pickhammer but he has tossed it into the sea.    Eventually there is a wall build around the entirety of the well feet tall but Orville is not satisfied. He pulls large boulders out of the ground to climb on and works with Albert to build a rounded ceiling putting the well in a protective dome. He destroys the boulders he used to boost his height and steps back. He gives the structure a mighty whack with his cane and it does not budge.    We have done well.

Yea they were falling. He looked like a stone statue as he just fell through the air contemplating what Sia had planned for this.

As Katarina and Sierra jump up upon its leg Katarinas swords lodge in the armor giving leverage to move with. The Kaiju angered at these tiny foes raised its leg up off the sandy bottoms out of the water held it suspended for a moment and then slammed the leg with crushing force back into the ground trying to blast them off. Its head snaps around as explosions hit its sides from the ramparts where Raul was commanding the soldiers the creature dipped its head into the water for a moment opening its jaws and swooping up a great gullet of water. Crunching its jaws shut you can see a ripple run through its neck as it reels its head back then snapping its jaws open and flinging its head forward as the muscles contracted in its throat. A huge cannon ball shaped expanse of water rockets from its mouth straight at the ramparts the water shears through a bottom half of another tower on its way towards Raul not even loosing a touch of momentum.

One grabbed for him and he screamed as he dove out of his chair taking his trombone case with him. He opens the case and quickly assembles his instrument that he had done so many time before. He watches carefully as the pirates begin rushing towards him when Argo tells everyone its time to work.Why are you so focused on me Im not the dangerous one on this crew.He began slowly regulating his breathing preparing for the combat as he placed the mouthpiece in the instrument. As soon as they began getting closer he let loose small bellicoso blasts just enough to sligtly move them around the deck of the ship. He aimed a majority of the bellicoso blasts so the other men were directed towards Argos waiting fists while the rest of them were sent careening over the railing into the ocean.,GLRP_EastBlue,chnu8aj,1,t5_2zi0t

1130727,0,t1_chwit4g,Speed. Speed and timing are the two most important things to Argo right now. To play the game of inches that five of his compatriots have already failed at.  Too fast and you dont get a rise and have the wave crash down on you too slow and you end up like those five surfers who have already fallen.  He judges the distance and then decides its time to work! He decides that hes going to make use of his arms this leg it really is a test of strength and Argo pulls out with a double arm drag to get himself going. The sea ahead of him was like glass in comparison to the wild storm behind him. And so like in a natural rhythm he begins with a freestyle swim stroke type motion.  Movement is life and Argo is trying to epitomize this. One arm drag  out and repeat. Not too fast not too slow.  Argo hums a jaunty tune occasionally looking back to judge his position. not like theres a whole lot he can do to save himself. But its nice to know how close death may be. But Death isnt near his board blades are catching the wave his speed has matched and now he is beginning to rise onto the Crest for further challenges.,GLRP_EastBlue,chwtehq,1,t5_2zi0t
1133113,0,t3_2738mj,AprilApril is starting off simple. She takes a look at the doorway. Placing one hand on her chin the other on her. She thought about how to utilize the space. There is plenty of clearance between the top of the door and the roof. She takes her handy tape measure getting all the dimensions  of the top of the doorway. She makes a few marks with a pencil an inch out on both sides of the doorway. Next April takes a x setting it down across the sawhorse she is borrowing for this job. April makes the measurement for her cut then positions the board. She grabs the long crosscut saw from her pile of tools one of the things she needs to address making a place for all those but for now she had to move one step at a time. She pulls her saw back and forth with force quickly making the cut clean through the plank. She then takes a chisel and hollows out two rectangular strips of wood. Making the piece of wood easier to grip for a bird. It is almost like three branches now. To finish it April takes a piece of sand paper to the piece of wood. She rounds off the edges around the whole board. Felicity is gonna lover her new perch.Lastly with Aprils cut plank of wood she grabs her framing hammer two metal brackets and a handful of large headed nails that are immediately stuffed in her pocket. She takes two nails in between her fingers and lines up one of the brackets on the wall with the pencil marks she made.. After she puts a nail into each hole hammering it into the wall. The nail head is larger than the hole the nail is in to prevent it from moving out of place. She repeats this with the other bracket. Then she sets the plank in between the two brackets April then hammers a nail in through the brackets to the both sides of the board to support the x.She takes a step back to marvel at her handiwork. It is only the first step but it is a glorious one. April moves over to Felicity getting her onto Aprils arm. Why dont you try it out? She asks the bird moving her wrist up to the new perch. Felicity moves an eager Ralph out to grasp the wood. She grabs on with one foot the moves over quickly. She starts going back and forth on the front of the perch.So you like it. The bird ruffles her feathers then lowers her head. April reaches up to pet the bird on the head. Petting a bird is strange there feathers dont feel as soft as other animals. April then grabs the eagles beak moving it up and down almost shaking hands with the bird. It was a good first step in making a home.,GLRP_EastBlue,chx3287,1,t5_2zi0t

Delicious stuff. Weve been here for a little while now just came from Whiskey Peak actually. Which reminds me.. the reason we called was for Silver Smith. I know hes part of your crew. There are a couple of guys in the Grand Line looking for him theyre not to be taken lightly either. One of them called himself Moon said he was his brother. I dont know how much of it was the truth but I cut the guys arm off only to see it grow back right in front of my eyes. The fucking Grand Line man.. he says shaking his head lightly.After a second the smile on Jacks face faded to one that could be only described as The look of the Grand Line.Make no mistake though Souji Im only telling you this as a favor to you and Lucille. I dont want you guys getting caught in the crossfire. These guys reek of trouble.Emmile rolled her eyes for a moment. The guy could lighten up already things were getting tense since they had entered the Grand Line.Well it doesnt sound like anything has changed for you guys I cant say it has for us either.

Ones that wont make him do their bidding and have him witness all kinds of terrible things. Ones that hell survive through thick and thin with in the Grand Line and grow in strength with. Ones thatll help him out when the time comes for the Lightbringers to declare war on the world government. It was pretty optimistic and he didnt even know if he was up to it. He wanted to do it no he felt like someone had to do it and in heat of the moment he said all kinds of things. But now he felt like they could do it one day.Thanks. I needed to hear you say that. Maybe being a criminal wont be so bad if I have you guys with me.Seeing things from the other sides perspective made him begin to see just how wrong he was in his assumption that all pirates are evil.

So young. So sad. One day Zenith might possibly kill this little boy just based on the fact that hes seen this in his dreams over and over again. Him as a bird against a giant dragon.

Which was interesting to say the least its like she wasnt expecting him to throw an actual hit and she tried to take note of that. The girl wrapper her right arm around his right arm and then slid her butt against Zeniths thigh. Hey now dont make me out to be a pervert or something.A hip throw huh?If he could remember based on what Yosh tried to do against him way back a throw was more about positioning and using momentum than strength. So that meant that if the positioning of one of the two people were off than it wouldnt work. He too turns his back towards Azure their backs practically touching as he wraps his left arm around hers. He then curves his back effectively stretching her back.,GLRP_EastBlue,cvl5428,1,t5_2zi0t

So its probably some sort of bird that was indigenous to South Blue. The fireproof bit was believable though even if LeShade hadnt shown that to him. He had seen first hand a creature who was quite resilient to lava itself over at Rayetta. Hell he even chased that creature down to the depths of hell itself so that he can fight it.Well we better hope that she lays eggs and a lot at that too.

Well to be honest Jack was  bottles of Whiskey under at this point anyway.Hey there e is! And hes got a friend! Get em!!cc shouted large man in the distance a torch raised in the air.As he shouted the battlecries of an angry mob pouring from a house behind the man rang out loudly.

She would place a hand on both of them.Oh these?  Actually I think these are just decorative swords.  I probably shouldnt use these in combat but they were the only swords in my house.  Zoey explained with an innocent smile.  But from what I read in books I think they are called wakizashi katana.  They are like regular katanas except shorter by a few inches.  She added.  Zoey would flash her hip forward at Souji with a cheeky smile sort of brandishing her swords in front of him.  Dont they make me look cool and experienced?  Zoey asked with a chuckle.

She would listen to Gray as he tried to console her saying that he felt the same way too once.  That he too had a black room and that she isnt alone in her black room.  She has a new friend she has Gray too now.  She would listen to Grays story about how he never knew his parents and how his Gramps found him.  In actuality they werent that much a like at all.  Zoey just ran away from home granted her home was a cancer to her personality and overall mentally abusive.  However she still had blood relatives and despite the bullying her sisters probably loved Zoey more than her parents did.  She would cling to Gray a bit tighter now not really stating how he was wrong about them being similar.  She didnt deserve for her backstory to be compared to something like Grays but this feeling this consolation felt so nice.Thank you Gray.  Zoey said sniffling.  Her crying having finally calmed down.  Ill return the favor.  She said.  She would turn her consoling embrace into a hug before pulling off of Gray.  Her smile appeared on her face again.Zoey would wipe her eyes as she started to chuckle.Well... I think that is enough of that... and meditation seems to be over for today... ya wanna do a quick sparring practice?  Zoey asked returning to her cheery excited self.

Hed shown that picture to more than one person and LeShade was actually the first to ask him that. Seemed that this guy brought back happier memories than the kid.That is my stepdad. Raised me from an infant and the only guy my brother would even acknowledge as a father. He was a marine actually taught me everything I know about swords. Hes long dead though.. he couldnt help but chuckle lightly at the last part despite what hed actually said. Hed died of natural causes so Jack had come to accept it relatively easily especially since theyd seen it coming from a mile away. He could almost feel the old guy rolling his eyes at Jack in the background once more.How about you you got anyone back home?Suddenly something he remember from a while ago jolted through his mind like a surge of electricity.Actually I met somebody a while ago looking for you.

If this was a result of something that occurred in the prison it was possible Revell and Zenith could end up the same way. Could this be why they had issued that challenge in the paper?
