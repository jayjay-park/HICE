1339836,0,t3_29emw8,Its not uncommon at all and no theres nothing wrong with her. Shes basically having her gecko period and its totally normal once they reach a certain size. As for whether or not you should get her a boyfriend thats up to you and whether you want to take care of the babies. If so I just recommend you do your research first and make sure its right for you as the most mama will do for them is not eat them as in the babies will need separate enclosures from her.,CrestedGecko,cikci9x,3,t5_2vwdx

1857572,0,t1_ckd0vix,That sounds like a wonderful idea its worth it to take your time and do things as best you can for both the geckos and yourself! I think of it this way as cresteds can live from  to  years youll have them a long time so its good to wait till you have the timemoneyresources instead of rushing into things. If there is a particulat morph you really want youll be happy that you waited for the right animal as well. You should post pics of your vivarium too I love seeing other peoples set ups!,CrestedGecko,ckd16kh,2,t5_2vwdx
1991225,0,t3_2hi3g0,That pattern is crazy,CrestedGecko,ckt55lb,1,t5_2vwdx
2380529,0,t3_2mmtsu,Also personal preference. But I keep my geckos food like mid tank height. It may be a little too high. Since I have a lot of geckos I like to leave some easy to get food on the bottom in case they want it just move it around to see where it likes it and it may be easier accessible when the glass is wet from misting,CrestedGecko,cm5xwpn,1,t5_2vwdx
2823311,0,t1_cnozjiz,Presumably I have to cut them up or do they just nibble at it?Also do you really not have to clean the tank? That just sounds too good to be true.,CrestedGecko,cnp05wo,1,t5_2vwdx
3056370,0,t1_coehwwt,Well I have that small tank for holding when Im cleaning the big one. Its too small in my opinion even for a baby to live in full time. If you do get it you will have to eventually buy a bigger one as it grows. ,CrestedGecko,coesgy5,1,t5_2vwdx
3678995,0,t3_31r2du,I keep Repashy in there all the time and change it every other day and I feed a cricket sometimes two a day to keep her actively running around. If I dont give her a cricket she seems to pout and wont come out of hiding. Shes learned what the black tubes hold in them!,CrestedGecko,cqbmogo,2,t5_2vwdx
4143836,0,t1_crrw1d8,Thank you for your advice. I got a couple of cresties that have been living together for a couple of months with no problem. I got plenty of foliage. I will probably separate them as they get a bit older and especially if one of them turns out to be male. ,CrestedGecko,crsm4x5,1,t5_2vwdx

4972627,0,t1_cul78fa,Its funny. When people come over and ask what its name is you say Fatbot. And theyll wonder why you would name it such a ridiculous name with perplexed looks on their faces and you can laugh.,CrestedGecko,culc4op,3,t5_2vwdx
5194227,0,t3_3m4s99,Ive got the same problem the crickets always come out and get eaten eventually but I guess since the backdrop is Styrofoam you could always use more and stuff it in the opening. But it has to be pretty tight since crickets are so crafty. ,CrestedGecko,cvc3ju0,1,t5_2vwdx

6904897,0,t1_d0yzdw8,I am trying it actually. My first clutch is due in two weeks. I also spent months doing research and raising up my breeders to make sure everything goes smoothly. Theres always the chance I wont be able to sell off the babies and its a scenario that anyone breeding anything should consider. ,CrestedGecko,d0yzmuy,2,t5_2vwdx
8006576,0,t1_d4fzwy5,Yeah I dont know who told you that and Im sorry youre in this position.The gallon would work as a temporary house. You can always buy a Rubbermaid bin from Walmart modify it drill ventilation holes and to grow the little one out. Its cheaper and you can get decent sized ones.Do the bumps look like little white bumps? Those are cloacal spurs and both genders have them though some argue they are more pronounced in males.If you have pictures of their vents we might be able to determine the sex of the g.,CrestedGecko,d4g0jm6,2,t5_2vwdx
8881034,0,t3_51sz13,He looks like a little ewok!    I really want to find some almost entirely black ones maybe a little tanbrown..  like gargoyle gegko coloring would be cool too.    but I love how his hands are black like hes got gloves on.Also dems some wicked nails.  Ill bet they draw blood ,CrestedGecko,d7fdih1,1,t5_2vwdx

9329389,0,t1_d8sl92r,Oh yeah ours are the same way. I like to sit on the couch with them and let them do little jumps onto the blankets. Just wish they wouldnt pee on me like every time I take them out lol.,CrestedGecko,d8ykgmi,1,t5_2vwdx
9330956,0,t1_d8ykpx3,She took out the geckos hide and now the gecko seems to be pooping and eating a little bit Ill let her know about the alternate foods to see if those may also work for her. ,CrestedGecko,d8yrm75,2,t5_2vwdx

10504501,0,t1_dcyraxu,BRILLIANT idea! Im at work now but this weekend I will  use my smoothie nanners for geck measures. I still need to post a picture of the little lady I brought home two weeks ago so this works!,CrestedGecko,dcysp1m,1,t5_2vwdx
10534169,0,t1_dd1wo4c,Thank you both so much for replying! We actually put in a couple crickets today and he ate one! Thanks for the advice and reassurance ,CrestedGecko,dd25xfs,3,t5_2vwdx
10824774,0,t3_5usk19,Just got my first crestie yesterday! Currently housing her in this xx because I got a great deal on the whole set up. Im moving out of my small apartment in a year and a half and plan on sizing her up then to maybe a xx. Lived in this same enclosure at the breeders and seemed pretty content and active. Might remove some of the coconut layer to make more vertical space or is it vital to maintain humidity?. The apartment is kept between  so Im thinking about buying a blue night bulb to keep on hr. Can I place the light fixture right on top or will it melt the plastic or metal mesh? ,CrestedGecko,ddwhzc6,2,t5_2vwdx
