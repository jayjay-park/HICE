10294310,0,t1_dca3fyb,No youre the best! Your pup is so lucky to have someone willing to spend the time and energy not to mention  to help him live his life to the fullest!Its going to be difficult and frustrating at times and thats  normal. Hes young and wants to burn off energy and cant and its going to be overwhelming sometimes. Itll be okay this will pass eventually. There are plenty of people in this sub that have experienced the exact same situation youre going through if you need advice or need to vent. Keep a positive attitude and lots of treats in your pocket! Best of luck! ,labrador,dcawzhi,2,t5_2taso

11081384,0,t3_5xzewb,A good vet will give some advice over the phone without charging you. At least mine does. Call them just to make sure but she probably just needs time to adjust. A former lab of mine did the same thing when the older one died. My current lab was basically traumatized a couple of weeks ago by a storm and he was in a funk for about a week before he snapped out of it.As long as he doesnt need the vet take him to the park and get him doing what he loves to do without actually babying him. I train my lab for hunting and the only time he seemed normal was during retrieving drills and I think it helped him come around.,labrador,deo2cjn,1,t5_2taso
