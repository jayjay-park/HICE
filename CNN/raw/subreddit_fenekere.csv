These were not originally part of the language and they do not follow the same rules as the original root words and their derivatives. The consonants and vowels used in the prefixes are the same ones as the rest of the language but they do not represent the same morphemes. Fenekere was original invented by ebejefe the Linguist. The prefixes were added later almost immediately actually by teehese. This is one of the reasons that while almost every other aspect of the language has a pronoun a single character root to describe it the prefixes dont. If teehese wasnt there to add them they wouldnt exist so they are called teaheso.,fenekere,cl6d4ip,2,t5_31cy3
