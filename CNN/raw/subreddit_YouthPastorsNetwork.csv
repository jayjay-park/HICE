6281112,0,t3_41mpr2,I dont think what you did was inappropriate but I think its important to be a pastor first and a friend second.   If I was a student and I saw favoritism or special treatment towards some students it wouldnt make me too happy.  Not that Im accusing you of doing that.    I think youre lucky that you had students that became such good friends that hopefully they went on to spread what you taught them. ,YouthPastorsNetwork,cz3lbu3,2,t5_3brhd
