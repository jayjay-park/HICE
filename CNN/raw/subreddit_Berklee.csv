1128700,0,t3_26zxug,MPEGuitar Performance dualmajor hereBring your guitar and a small amp for the practice rooms. You dont get to practice in your dorm if youre on the berklee campus. Most jams youll have will take place in rooms that have an amp so dont worry about it too much.I came from really far away so I couldnt carry much more than a weeks worth of clothes my instrument and bedsheets. Personally Im glad for this. There were no opportunities for distraction whenever I was in my room. College certainly can be scary and it can feel like you should bring every xbox microphone and framed picture you have but  I guarantee you that a youll get so engulfed in the first semester you wont have time to miss anything from back home and b someone else will have things that you could borrow if you need a microphone stand or a large amp etc.The most important thing to bring is an open mind. Seriously. Focus on doing well in classes try to enjoy even the classes that feel like a waste of money and stay connected to your Peer Advisor I used to be one youd be amazed at how well we can help but most of us only help when asked. Jam whenever you can but try to get to know people for nonmusical reasons too. If you only care about how well your friends play youll find pretty quickly that you wont have any friends.Also ignore anyone who tells you that the only successful people from Berklee dropped out after  semesters. That statement is complete bullshit.,Berklee,chwl6le,3,t5_2regy

5592428,0,t3_3rpp5s,You take a survey closer to the start of the semester and they try to match you up with people who have similar survey results.  Be as honest and realistic about yourself as possible on the survey if you want someone compatible.  ,Berklee,cwqakez,2,t5_2regy
6056924,0,t1_cyd915z,Seconded. They happen like minds clump together everywhere the important thing is to not get caught up in any egotism or elitism any of them have. Hang with people you work well with learn from those you dont keep an open mind and practice humility. Youre experience depends on your own attitude and no one elses.,Berklee,cydk6dm,2,t5_2regy

7865047,0,t1_d40367b,I just graduated from EPD with a minor in audio for video games.  I love the program I think its one of the real hallmarks of the school.  Its sort of the cutting edge of Berklee in terms of music technology so there is always interesting stuff going on.  Audio for games is new to Berklee and I hear rumors that there might be an entire major dedicated to this soon.  You can sort of choose your own track in EPD.  If you choose game audio you will learn how to create audio assets from scratch or procedurally and then implement them in games.,Berklee,d403qfl,1,t5_2regy
