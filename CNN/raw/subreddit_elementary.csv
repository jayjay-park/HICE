As the moderator Im allowed selfrighteous internet policing on this subredditand occasionally a few other places across the web in order to make sure things work on this reddit. But Im upvoting you because that was a glorious level of sarcasm. ,elementary,cmkid84,3,t5_2sn2r

7488189,0,t1_d2squ0i,Oh whoops! I meant to include that in my post. Its the episode where Watson is kidnapped and theyre Mycroft and Sherlock working to get her back. MampS have to track down a guy that apparently has a document with a list of names of people major figures with hidden private accounts to dodge taxes. I know thats a pretty common thing but the list aspect and having big names on it made me think of the Panama Papers.  I watched it a few days ago as Ive been binge watching the show so my recollection might not be entirely there.,elementary,d2td7nz,2,t5_2sn2r

The way ACD describes him makes him pretty impressive. Besides hes from the Illustrious Client which is again a case that is so good and horrible and compelling and once traumatized me so much that I think nobody whos read it could ever forget any part of it. ,elementary,dgaziuc,2,t5_2sn2r
