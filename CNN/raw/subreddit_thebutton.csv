There are much better things you can do with your mouse than tapping the first button that comes your way.. No matter where you do it how you do it or in what position the wrong people will tend to find out.. The less you look at the button pressers the less theyll look at you.. Make the trends dont follow them.. Hypocrisy is not the best policy. Stay strong nonpressers!. Save that first tap for when you are really ready.. Nonpressers have more fun and tend to be happier..

Youll see that the time continues to tick down. Wait until it ticks all the way down to zero.Now we are going to enter  javascript commands to see what will happen at the end of time. Your browser is waiting for messages from reddits servers via websockets when it receives those messages it performs a function. We are just going to call those javascript functions directly while the internet is disconnected.In google chrome open View gt Developer gt JavaScript console in the text field typer.thebutton.onJustExpiredsecondselapsed  HIT ENTER r.thebutton.onExpiredsecondselapsed  HIT ENTER voila end of time.,thebutton,cpya3tq,2,t5_36buk

It seems like there might be a benefit to clicking it at a lower time which seems damn near impossible literally everyone Ive checked is at either  or .Imagine if it was ticking down toward  and you hadnt clicked yet.  Youd be so tempted to click to get that  and possibly some kind of achievement on your user page.  Itd hit  and some dbag would click it resetting it to .

However what happened to me and I believe a few others with low times is that we clicked when the clock lagged on our end. For most people this simply gets them marked as a s or s when their timer resyncs but for a lucky few like me a glitch causes us to get lower times however we also get the cheater flair.

Lets say the reddit server receives  clicks each in separate packets the packets can either be sorted by time and the first packet can be used to reset the server and the other  are given s or the first one resets the server but since the other  were sent while the timer wasnt at s theyre also given the same credit as the first.Id imagine it was most fair for the programmer to choose the second case.

I think that was buoyed by a second wave of media attention which got another wave of interest in the button after the initial oh hey an April Fools thing reaction of most redditors. Id be happy if we dropped  seconds every night until the end but if that were to happen I wouldnt call this endtimeswed still have another two weeks and the buttons only been around for  days. Do you think that the yellow rush heralds a precipitous drop in low seconds per night?

Some intelligent people using legitimate analysis have looked at the trends and predicted thebutton will go unpressed in approximately two weeks.Are we as a group doomed to fit the statistical model? Do we have any power to significantly change the end? Can we rise above the base behavior that numbers confine our group to and act as a whole?Do we as a species have any power to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions or delay peak oil? If we cant influence the average presser to waitasecond to tap a finger what hope is there?What happens when it runs out? It is guaranteed that we will find out someday and that day is approaching. If we choose not to exert our influence and do nothing the result will be the same. The individual presser has only the power to delay. Do we believe that our life has meaning and our actions can improve the world?We need organizers strategists monitors lieutenants and recruits all willing to press when needed. We need them now. We will all have to press and we are all pressers. Purples are not worthless in this undertaking or immune from responsibility. We need to get the word out that we are organizing. There are countless potential pressers out there who dont even know the button exists. People have created throwaway accounts that are long forgotten and could press again this time with the knowledge that a disciplined press could be made by their childrens children. Maybe it is just a timer. Then all of this was for nothing. Maybe. Do your part. Delay the end. ,thebutton,cqezbln,2,t5_36buk

Let me tell you a story reddit about your current interim CEO who is trying to keep the job dont forget to tell uknthing that this isnt acceptableRead  Ellen Pao reddit interim purple CEO COURT DOCS they are funny and strangeOR READ THIS LOLSOME  COMMENT CHRONOLOGICALCHROMALOGICAL BREAKDOWN OF THE COURT DOCSRead  Seven comment breakdown of COURT DOCS cross referenced by year with lots of lulzze storyThe current before she is in purpleprison reddit joke CEO is Ellen Purple Pao as of a few months ago when Yishan Wong who personally hired her and put her forward for the CEO position and has totally not had sex with her either honest hes married she wouldnt do that stepped down instantly without warning... and she was instated within the week. Unheard of.Ellen Pao a psychotic and entitled purple monster who is being investigated by the SEC and FBI along with her hubby for their role in a ponzi scheme ripping people off. Ellen Pao WAS fraudulently suing their previous employer to get some gomoney as she is  Bankrupt  Illiquid  In massive debt  Purple  Any other synonyms for fucked?She lost her case and even went after Starbucks thats a lie the starbucks bit I meanDear Ellen Pao The verdict came back You get NOTHING. You LOSE. Good day sir.But guess what? Order now and well throw in a pretrial injunction that forbids the discussion of Ellen Paos financial situation or flair. Right. Because the fact that she has negative net worth and zero liquidity despite her charity position at reddit has no bearing on a MM hail mary. those gilds on this comment are literally paying for her lawyers coffees... I le sigh.While doing so she is taking every chance to shit on every woman who has truly suffered discrimination at their job.Ellen Pao is trying to characterize a relationship she had while at the company as almost rape saying she succumbed to advances... and while it wasnt rape it was consensual... not rape... did I say rape enough yet?   She invited the guy out for dinner  she said he was her hero and his mind was amazing  she bought him chocolates  she admitted she loved him    wanted to marry him    wanted to have kids with him  FYI She never said this was rape in fact she has MANY MANY TIMES said it was not rape. You know. Like a suspicious number of times. Which is weird. She usually says it like it was entirely consensual dot dot dot or it wasnt rape at all dot dot dot. Like I dont know theres something sinister and almost rapey about her having sex with someone if he didnt leave his wife for her afterwards. Or she just wants the words not rape and wasnt nonconsensual on the jurys mind.But wait for it. They had sex... and you know what that means in her mind. Entitlement.So it turns out HE DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIS WIFE FOR HER. Ellen Pao seduced sorry succumbed to the advances of and clearly someone who cannot make their own sober decisions about which dick to suck needs to be a CEO. I know many many women who are capable of saying no to sucking dick someone hold me... and screwed a married guy at work then got antsy when he didnt leave his wife.Wait... but that cant be true I just said she didnt have sex with Yishan Wong because hes married and... wait. Just to be clear moves mic closer Yishan Wong did not have sexual relations with Ellen Pao. Allegedly. I mean.The current Reddit CEO Ellen Pao totally did not have sex with the last Reddit CEO Yishan Wong just making that clear in case anyone else reads between the lines and gets the wrong idea ALSO Ellen Pao DID NOT RAPE Yishan Wong. I know I probably shouldnt even bring it up but I just want to be clear on that.She didnt rape him but you see the effect first hand now. Seriously though guys this rumor should not get out of hand. Its probably salubrious and prophylactic just to casually mention that Ellen Pao did not rape Yishan Wong to get the CEO position. I mean lets nip this rumor in the bud before it spreads. Lets get ahead of it.Edit Ive heard rumors that huffingtonpost is going to run the rape allegation story that seems a bit unfair we really shouldnt let this get out of hand. Even purples deserve a fair trial hashtag fair criminal trial against ellen pao nowShe also did not promise him a cut of her winnings of  if he stepped down his reddit position poorly paid one at that and vie for ten years salary payment from her instead by making her a CEO although a joke title here at le reddits it looks good for her case.oooooh snap! MauryI am not the father danceSo when he decided not to leave his wife for her after a brief fling she is on record showing she spent FIVE YEARS deliberately trying to stir shit up how much shit? Literally  pieces of paper. Shes trying to win the old hailmary sue my company by a sheer volume of attack combined with five years of only keeping emails and parts of reply chains that gave a context to her being shunned. She goads people and tries her damnedest to cause conflict to get it on record. AND FAILS!So she thinks that she has  throws of the dice to win this case. It doesnt work that way.. She was paid MORE than her male colleagues. Given the best mentorship guidance and coaching from the most reknown and expensive coaches. She had hundreds of complaints filed against her from WOMEN in the organization that she MASSIVELY discriminated against filing poor reviews and criticisms and complaints against almost all women she worked with.. She has emails showing her taking advice from lawyers back in  then one friend of hers saying delete all emails except those you can use to try and sway your case. So she did that. For five years.. Her complains amount to I was made to sit at the back and take notes. Despite only doing that on ONE occasion and actually spending the first days in the front row people not letting me in to their deals... after people complaining she was always trying to get into deals after the research and diligence was done instead of coming up with her own ideas. Thats it literally it.. She was offered her dream job the job she wrote she wanted when she was found to have failed EVERY SINGLE employee assessment for five years running and missing EVERY TARGET. She refused knowing it would hurt her CASE she had been building if she accepted.. She starts suing them while working there being extremely abrasive basically like Westboro Baptist abrasive while trying to goad someone to make a move that would help her case. Nobody did.. As SOON as she complained they hired an investigator for her literally within a minute to help her. She refused to speak to the investigator they hired to HELP HER while she was preparing her case and finally did ONLY WITH HER OWN LAWYER PRESENT lol.So she wanted to paint a picture of her being oppressed. What a sad fuck. Pissing in the face of every hard working person and shitting on the progress so many amazingly talented women have made.  Ellen Pao also lied and sabotaged  womens promising careers just to make sure they werent promoted as this would have damaged her case  she had a lawyer on retainer since  and spent  years trying to frame a company for things they didnt do.Thats right Ellen Pao shit into the mouths of all those professional women who would never stoop to such dirty fraud to get ahead. girlsCEOEllen Pao wants someone to gild her  because she fucked a married guy they talked about him leaving his wife and marrying her and having kids he didnt... somehow that entitles her to  and its totally not a hailmary because shes going to prison. When the SEC  FBI get through untangling the ponzi scheme in the Caymans. is also the amount that Buddy Fletcher and her have stolen from Firefighters pension funds.

The instant gratification in the button is based more off of curiosity than a desire for it now. In the first couple days everybody got purple without knowing any better because they werent told any different. Just press the button or dont. Noone was told you can press it now and get purple flair or wait and press it later for red flair. A social experiment nonetheless but not an experiment in instant gratification.

3812797,0,t1_cqqrwt0,I personally liked And Another Thing... which does follow immediately after Mostly Harmless and ties a niceish cheerfulish bow around the depressing plot of that last book by Douglas.         There was no th book so I dont know where the other people are getting that figure although both short stories I mentioned are reprinted in The Salmon of Doubt which is mostly a collection of Douglass nonfiction writings but also contains around a dozen chapters of what would have perhaps been a third Dirk Gently novel or maybe another Hitchhiker one near the end of his life he lamented to his friends that some of the ideas he was writing were more fitting for the universe of the latter than the former. In that case we might still only have six because Eoin Colfer might have never been asked to write And Another Thing... Confused? Just wait.        You could make the argument that Douglas Adams Starship Titanic is a book in the Hitchhikers universe after all the idea for the story came from a footnote in Life the Universe and Everything. But that was written by Monty Pythons Terry Jones most probably while he was nude read the forward for more details. There are no common characters planets alien species or even mention of The Guide so the connection is weaker than anything else here.        If you havent read Dirk Gentlys Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul go now to Amazon and buy them.,thebutton,cqqw1bf,2,t5_36buk

It showed wrong numbers to some people and question marks to others but it still registered presses and reset the timer properly on the back end of things which means the people who pressed during these outages got a completely different number than the one they pressed on.   This last one did the opposite it showed everybody the correct numbers ie. people actually got the number they pressed on but none of the presses reset the timer which is why I would argue that the presses werent actual presses because according to the announcement a press resets the timer. These presses didnt which is why I feel they should have been rolled back.

3861854,0,t3_34nulr,Actually thats not true. Lets say literally everyone followed your strategy to the letter. How long would the button last?The answer is  minutes. After one minute everybody clicks and after one more minute the button ends. Its not like you can schedule a minute for every user to click.Think of reddit as a big distributed system without a central scheduler say a TCPIP network. In such networks you can minimize congestion by randomizing delays between broadcasts.Having a population of nonpressers who have some probability lt  of clicking when the button reaches their own private threshold between  and  is actually a very robust way to keep the button alive for as long as possible.,thebutton,cqwhhvc,1,t5_36buk

This is fundamental misunderstanding of what makes this game great. For one you wish to lie about your true nature as a presser. So this ends up making you lie about anything you have to say about the button. Next any attempt by you to join in in a particular group becomes an idealistic role play about yourself and how a fictional you would react in a particular circumstance. But it would be a guess. You would not actually know. So this makes your actions phoney.Ok so you can join one group the I collected all the flairs group. But you still know you not only pressed the button but you did it a bunch of times. This defeats the aspect of obtaining any flair. You get bored and then what? You go away and forget about the button.What do you think will happen? The button finishes and you get to post about being an elitist? That you turned a test of integrity and honesty into some kind of pissing match about how prepared you were despite having no more knowledge than anyone else?I get it you want to be special. Everyone does. But when you try to achieve it by throwing away your integrity all you do is make yourself a fool. And fools are not special.,thebutton,cr42pn4,14,t5_36buk

I believe it will just pause and wait for a s presser.Ive seen red variously defined as ss  s and ss Red flair being available down to s should indicate s presses are naturally possible and thus it simply waits for a press when it hits .

Text is grouped so close together and without a mouse pointer to see where Im clicking before I click I have to go in blind with my finger and hope I hit the right thing.Not to mention issues with zoom as sidebars take up valuable screen space on mobile. When chrome stretches to accommodate it it makes all the font on screen smaller forcing me to pinch and zoom to make the content I actually want to see take up the whole screen. With an app sidebars are hidden unless you swipe from the right side of the screen to pull them up comment threads automatically take up the full width of the screen when you go to them and linksposts are spaced plenty far apart.,thebutton,crbm1r1,18,t5_36buk

4090716,0,t1_crmgga5,I was gonna write something really long here but the sumup isYep indigo doesnt belong on the color wheel. But purple and orange dont really either  theyre really tertiary colors. However theres a conflict between the color wheel  which should represent all the hues we can see  and the spectrum  which represents all the hues of visible light. There are colors on the color wheel that dont appear in the spectrum because theyre the result of our photoreceptors being stimulated by multiple frequencies of light at once and magenta falls into that category.Violet and orange basically get promoted because they pop out nicely in a rainbow while cyan is difficult to distinguish for us from light blue and magenta doesnt exist in rainbows at all.And I think the button colors are clearly meant to be more representative of the spectrum  highenergy purples down to lowenergy reds  than of the color wheel.,thebutton,crmkelh,3,t5_36buk

4108664,0,t1_crolyyu,Thank you for this. I read philosophy books in my free time and spend a good amount of time thinking about abstract concepts. My stance isnt that I am correct but that there are different ways of approaching a concept. The button by its very nature brings about these kinds of conversations I love which is why Ive been sticking around. I am enjoying the responses that are thought out since it lets me see another persons way of approaching that concept or idea. Ive never really put much thought into choices decisions options how they interact with each other what sets them apart what is the same how should we approach it. Personally I think a choice involves a lot more than simple knowledge of somethings existence. I feel intent plays a role and how active that concept is in ones head and how the relates to something being or not being a choice on which one decides upon. Things are more complicated than Oh you know gardeners exists therefore you CHOOSE to not be one! I mean it isnt like we are all actively thinking about EVERYTHING we know all at once always forever. Thoughts just dont work that way.,thebutton,crom30i,1,t5_36buk

We are not waiting for anything. We chose long ago. Nothing is being decided for us. We decided on day one.Look I get it. As more and more pressers get their flair and feel regret they need to keep finding new ways to rationalize the consequence of their choice. Youre a presser. End of story.
