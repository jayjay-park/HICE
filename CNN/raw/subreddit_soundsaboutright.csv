Maybe he was pranking his friends and he thought he took all the bullets out? Ugh...that is not much better. ,soundsaboutright,crds4cq,1,t5_2z525

5172321,0,t1_cv9e0hh,Wow someones salty. Grime is a genre that evolved from drum amp bass and garage music that originated in the UK. Skepta is one of the most well known artists in this genre. In recent years it has become more commercial and less street so theres a grime revival going on trying to take grime back to its roots as a genre.As to why you should care its up to you if youre interested in the music and the scene. Nobody is forcing you to care.,soundsaboutright,cv9gdwv,8,t5_2z525
