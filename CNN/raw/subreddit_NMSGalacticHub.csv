Completely different. Desert planet. Same name undiscovered name. Built a scanner and checked coords. They match your screen other than the first few letters prior to the actual coords.Im in survival on PS. What platform and mode are you playing?Ill upload some screens later to show what I ran into.

11025127,0,t3_5x4ulu,Oh hey Patdaddy.  Sorry bout that.  I had discovered the other  planets in that system and that was my last planet to explore.  I did not know you were still in the system as the name wasnt set for the planet but I did see the fauna was  complete so I did name that planet after U.  I was not making fun of your screen name bro calm down. There is the YouTube live stream if you want to take a look.  I was in the system for an hour and twenty minutes or so starting around the hr min mark and ending at the hr  min mark.  Also boss man says hey guys go explore this region theres gonna be a lot of people exploring the same region you are.  This problem is bound to happen.  There may be more than one or  people in the same system and if you dont upload a discovery and goto sleep there is a chance someone else will name it.  Thats just how it goes.  I was not trying to make fun of your name or take your discoveries or anything.I had already spent some time in that system exploring the  other planets.  I was naming each planet as I explored them.  I was in that system for at least an hour or more looking for fauna and resources.I did not just land and take off and name the planets or system and try to take them from you.  Nothing showed as discovered in the system except for the fauna on that planet and that was the last planet I landed on. WIth so many people exploring the same area this is bound to happen eventually.  I was exploring one system and was on my second planet when lilianara jumped in and named the system I am sure this wont be the first time that will happen either.  My name is IgottwormmS it comes from the Dumb and Dumber movie and was going to be the name of their worm store in the movie I really dont have worms sorry to disappoint anyone.Im not tryin to make fun of you or name steal your system or planets.  I thought there was a possibility u could have been there but I also thought of the possibility that you werent and maybe that planet would not have been named so I named it.I apologize if you were offended in any way.  These things happen sometimes and will happen with so many people exploring the same area.,NMSGalacticHub,deho3p1,1,t5_3ha7e

11285270,0,t3_612kyk,This is a new planet report for Oyamachi a Korvax system in the Roof of Rento. Oyamachi is a fairly standard Korvax system found amongst a cluster of recently discovered systems just a few intersystem jumps from Lennon.First in the series of planets is Nurlov a planet plagued with atmospheric contaminants. Nurlovs vast plains are scarred with immense cracks along the orange molten glass that stretch into the horizon. With Megaliths on youll see tall green crystals scattered all over the plains. Uranium?! Nurlov is an extremely hostile planet  storms will regularly block out the sun and an aggressive flotilla of Sentinels will always keep a laser trained on you. Top it all off... with nope crabs! However if you ever wanted to find Grav Balls and Calium in one spot Nurlov is definitely a go for treasureseekers who dont mind the danger! When youre on Nurlov you cant help but feel some race just as smart as you are used to live here  and that upon splitting the atom they found objectionable uses for it... less objectionable.Gihareya is a dead planet. Nothing at all worth mentioning here with the bleak dark purple landscape and an occasional voxel rock.Zahig is a scorched planet with low lying plains and hills with an occasional rise in the distance. Fairly populated by creatures of different sorts the ground and atmosphere combination would almost make you think its Australia! Except the kangaroos have antlers! Landing on some sides of the planet does produce some very scenic vistas to see the neighboring bodies in among the stars. With Megaliths on theres the very mild addition of an extra tree species to spice up the largely barren terrain.Aiwaniwa is the systems only exosuitfriendly planet. A fairly rocky world of very infrequent floral capacity a chain of ponds and rivers fill the bottommosts of the landscape while mountains and spaghetti formations fill the rest of the gaps. With Megaliths on huge rather spiny towering leaf plants will fill the horizon. Despite the rather limited plant biosphere Aiwaniwa is home to some fascinating creatures starting with flying oneeyed eerie bananaface things a beautiful space dragonfly and a lizard... dinosaur... thing The latter of the three succeeded through a violent introduction too  a sudden slash at your exosuit backpack and upon turning you see this guy growling and wanting to definitely add a few more slices on your suit with clawed hunts. Suffice to say he was a quick dispatch.Morovoi is the next planetoid in the system a moon of Aiwaniwa. Extremely hilly almost cratered terrain leaves you with vast distances visible to the eye and occasional patches of radioactive flora manage to be natives here. Angry Sentinels will keep watch on you but as the rambunctious terrain dictates  deploying your Roamer to get some SIIICK boost jumps will easily put you out of their way! I was completely expecting to find Gravitino Balls on the surface given Sentinel presence but did not find large enough patches to make a noteworthy listing of them. After a few cicles and quite a lot of jumps on naturallyeroded ramps I decided to leave the planet after a terrain survey.Sadansvar is the last stop in the system. This moon is indeed a rather bright sunny place  it would be a perfect place to go sunbathing if it werent for the fact youd turn into baked macaroni if you ever bothered exiting your exosuit. not like you can anyway! Sadansvar is home to some odd insectlike multijointed creatures  youve seen some of those yourself surely but the ones here were pretty huge! The rolling red lowlying hills make for a perfect Roamer excursion which is exactly what I did managing to impress myself by drifting down along a hill!Now one fascinating aspect I found out about the game overall dring my time experiencing this Sadansvar are the huge warped trees Megaliths added. As you can guess these are actually lush trees  that are warped a bit. Examining the provided screenshot will immediately show two of the trees seemingly leaning to each other and this hunchbackedness is shared by other trees of the same species. The odd thing would be these trees look completely upright until you approach them when they suddenly gain their drastic winded bend. It seems to be part of some level of detail system where the warp effect only appears when you get close as most tree props in the game generally do not ever get this large anyway. One of the older GDC videos from Hello Games talked about how trees were deformed via an animation skeleton to further give them variety. This is... well the first time Ive seen it.This concludes the planet log for Oyamachi a Korvax system in the upper limits on the Roof of Rento!Previous Planet Report Records C Aijimana XIII  Seiyoshi  NoomUjer  Yonezaki  Anabesca  Yugashi  crossdiscovered by vmworks and NecroBones D Nekoku  crossdiscovered by NecroBones  Rotunaxo  Molinu C Ikonomia  Vistyino VI  Iakhanya,NMSGalacticHub,dfb633b,2,t5_3ha7e

11571232,0,t3_655qn4,The one on the anomaly shown was only  slots when I looked but a pretty decent Aclass in any case. I intend to look around the system and see if there are any  slot versions especially if it can be found as Sclass.This is a really nice star system in general. On PC Ive named it HUBG Sibinz Uxin as usual based on the random name. It has  planets two of which are frozen one of those has oceans and one is lush and beautiful. Another is a very hellishlooking barren world. Hopefully this means it has a lot of chances to check for various slot counts and class levels for the multitool.gt This screenshot shows the star info with the Rento tree visible on the right.,NMSGalacticHub,dg7lsjl,2,t5_3ha7e
11571484,0,t1_dg7kq05,I was looking into that but since I deleted my hanging pearl garden when I moved to the HUB I cant see replacing it with containers.I did move  ships filled of pearls to a starred station the other night my  slot with  free bays brought me about mil the other ships and suit netted me like another  mill.   Whereas my  slots of pearls I think was sold at . for about  mil straight from the freighter to the station.,NMSGalacticHub,dg7mtnf,1,t5_3ha7e

11584070,0,t1_dg8ga1i,Yes i like the video but some things are not told. Like NMSSurvivalGuru great as a basic explanation though.Anyway website will tell you to travel directly when you are under jumps in the hint panel.Also now that people can adjust hyperdrive range everything flows just right.,NMSGalacticHub,dg927sp,2,t5_3ha7e

11594991,0,t1_dgaanwk,Yeah lol. I will fill up two ships I have a large nip nip farm on my freighter worth of nip while Im out exploring plants regrow every  minutes and take the full cargo to Denzels Wake to sell it all for about  mill. If Im trying hard I can make  mil an hour usually. I dont know if it beats the pearl farm but it flows with my gameplay better. ,NMSGalacticHub,dgaau38,1,t5_3ha7e

11619211,0,t3_65miak,.. Location Yzawa  Coordinates ISHNEFD  Region Ladwilszecz Fringe  Jumps Remaining Position Forget what I said about the Fp system being the best space color. The straight F  is actually black space with yellow gaseous clouds as highlights. Reminds me of the system the real Nostromo visited in the movie Alien. Thats what Im lookin for now. The drudgery of the long haul has begun to set in.  or so jumps followed by several hours of collecting resources for the next series of jumps. Its all Heridium Carbon Plutonium and Thamium with a touch of Zincwhich for the element thats needed the least is actually the one that takes the longest to gather. At least I finally found a good use for the sentinels each one contains about the same amount as a Zinc flower. Ive switched from the small exocraft to the medium rover which allows me to gather Plutonium without having to get out and shoot it  but its slower than the fourlegged cycle so I dont seem to be saving much time.In between jumps Im catching up on reading about the Hub which makes it even more frustrating that I cant get there sooner. I miss my home base. Cant wait to rebuild it and to see other peoples versions. If I start gathering for more than  cells at a time I can get there in four jumpseries. Worth the extra effort.,NMSGalacticHub,dgd1r0x,1,t5_3ha7e
11619224,0,t1_dgd1o75,Youre welcome good luck finding the best one.,NMSGalacticHub,dgd1sxy,1,t5_3ha7e
11620281,0,t3_65tmbn,Youre in good shape! My journey was  jumps at about  degrees left of center. I started out  regions below. I recommend start aiming up at a  degree angle for your first jumps until you are on the same region. Then its a straight shot and you dont have to aim up or down for the rest of the trip. Your angle isnt bad either. Line up the center then move right until the center is maybe not quite half way between the middle and edge of the screen. Make a couple jumps then hop down to a planet to get your coordinates and check that your angle isnt changing too much. Once you have a straight path you can go maybe  jumps before you have to check again. When you are  jumps away or so you have to start checking every jump for accuracy. Good luck!,NMSGalacticHub,dgd64bt,1,t5_3ha7e
11622703,0,t3_65v5yk,Yes I ve had this happen to me  or  times while tabbing out to my other screens. Also Im mapping the Bisticabi Boundary since I came to the HUB a couple day ago. Maybe well be neighbors if you decide to settle here. Cheers and good luck!,NMSGalacticHub,dgdg0ef,3,t5_3ha7e

11776178,0,t1_dguqg6d,I renamed all the planets in the system so whats showing on the Wiki page for Makonis are the new names. You can upload these as replacements or name them what you want I suppose. There are already vast differences between the PS and PC versions of the Hub.According to the properties page for the System info boxes there should be a place to register which platform the information is for. I dont see it showing up in the actual boxes on the pages though. Not sure whats up with that. I think the best thing would be for all the names to match but in reality thats a nearly hopeless task. Theres just no easy way to find out if the undiscovered system you just entered has already been discoveredrenamed on another platform since you wouldnt know which name to be looking for. Ultimately each platform is going to be a slightly different reality sorta like the mirror universes in Star Trek.,NMSGalacticHub,dguv6zi,1,t5_3ha7e
11778420,0,t3_67fflc,So I stopped by in the official capacity of researching player bases for the Wiki and took my very first base race on your track. I may well have been the very first to use your track too because ... I set the record!  Not bad for a lowly Cartographer. This in spite of the fact that the cave through which the course runs is now pretty well choked off by Comm Stations and I also had to deal with some illegal interference from one of the locals Seriously though great base and a fun racetrack. Looking forward to posting this as one of the first Base pages...!,NMSGalacticHub,dgv4dnk,1,t5_3ha7e
