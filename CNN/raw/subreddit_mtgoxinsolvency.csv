427921,0,t1_cfp43kq,biasedMark is a very strict about what his people says and even more what he says. I dont know what were the lies he pushed in forbes and others for. But if they were to create better picture of company then I find my explanation much more appealing. If he would be speaking about something uncertain he would have used if as you did. He is a programmer and temporaily by programmers mean can vanish just about anytime. You are also explaining only the second part of the sentence. How would you describe the part where he says the no coins were lost?biased,mtgoxinsolvency,cfp4ayw,2,t5_30lhf

465495,0,t1_cft4frf,I think they might have accidentally a word or two there. I believe the spirit of the sentence is that currently by order of the court Mt. Gox is in a frozen state until they can assess the damage. They later go on to talk about repayments so I dont think its nefarious. ,mtgoxinsolvency,cft6fik,1,t5_30lhf

801367,0,t3_23bhg5,As far as I can confirm from WSJ and reuters this is the official site of the Hollywood investors seeking support from MtGox creditors for their plan. Personally I believe this to be the best option available for people like me who are owed BTC. This bit is tellingWe believe Mark Karpeles has changed course in an effort to avoid personal liability but in doing so has sacrificed your interests.I think thats right. As the WSJ article I posted indicates Mark was fully supportive of this but changed tack to avoid having to go to the US. ,mtgoxinsolvency,cgvda6d,2,t5_30lhf

1796669,0,t1_ck5ju6r,Youre missinterpreting feelingoks post and  dusuenders post.   dusuender is claiming that MK is responsible for suicides because he didnt post more information about what happened.But the primary claim that  dusuender is making is that MK is responsible for suicides because he didnt tell everyone what he knew after Gox crumbled.For that to be true you have to believe the following. The suicides wouldnt have happened if MK told everyone what happened a HUGE assumption and one we have no reason to believe.. That more harm wouldnt have come from MK spilling the beans.  Given that we dont have any idea what MK is withholding if much of anything we cant really know with any certainty what the more moral course of action is.. That MK actually IS largely responsible for the collapse of MtGox.Now Its odd to be defending MK.  Personally I think hes responsible for something but its a huge stretch to say hes morally responsible for strangers committing suicide because he hasnt come out and say whats happened.  This is a criminal investigation.  Itd be irresponsible to release information about what happened as it reveals to the criminals what is know.,mtgoxinsolvency,ck5ma42,2,t5_30lhf

4035634,0,t1_cqlqsjl,SuggestionCombine selling of K coin and buying it back into one auction.So the steps would be. determine distribution of the assets over all creditors based on the April  Coindesk price this seems to be mandated by Japanese law and the way the claims are being recorded now.. all creditors end up with a fraction of both the remaining JPY and the remaining BTC. Build an order book as follows .. Creditors who want JPY only want their BTC auctioned off.  So their BTC is put up in a market sell order .. Creditors who want BTC only want to buy BTC for the amount of JPY they have or put differently want to sell their JPY for BTC.  So their JPY is put up in a BTC market buy order for that amount of JPY which is somewhat different than a traditional market order where you specify the amount of assets you want to buy not the money you want to spend. . In order to get an equilibrium price that is close to market price the order book is opened to outsiders.  That is any Kraken user can put in a limit BTC buy or sell order in the order book.   . An equilibrium price is found by determining the price at which the amount of BTC to be sold is the same as the amount of BTC to be bought is the same as the amount of BTC to be sold Remarksrefinements. in order for an outsider to enter the auction she would need to be a Kraken user and have funded the account with JPY or BTC if they they think the equilibrium price would be higher than market price and they hope to sell into it with a high limit order. That seems to be a high threshold.  However Kraken could allow margin orders with BTC as collateral or another currency  such as USD.  How much collateral is needed is up to Kraken to determine.  In any case BTC allows to transfer funds to be put up as collateral in an auction in about an hour so.... There is no reason why creditors could not use limit orders as well instead of  market orders.  So that would mean I am willing to convert my fraction of the BTC assets to JPY if the price is above xxx or I am willing to convert my fraction of remaining JPY to BTC if the price is under yyy.  I am not sure whether creditors would be allowed that freedom either by JP regulations or by a decision by the trustee.,mtgoxinsolvency,crgajp1,3,t5_30lhf
