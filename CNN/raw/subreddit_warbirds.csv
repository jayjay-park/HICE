3918302,0,t3_35bv9q,Normally my zoom lens is enough for what I need. Today I wish I had a more powerful lens though.  Thankfully the weather cooperated and it was pleasantly warm with a light breeze.  I tried to get near the Washington Monument and yet still in the shade.My attempts to capture both the monument and aircraft generally failed to produce any interesting photos sadly. I wasnt at a good angle or distance for it.,warbirds,cr2x7qx,1,t5_2wumt
