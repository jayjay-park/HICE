If so I can recommend most amazing country for you to visit that is really close byIll give you some areas around the Yorkshire Dales as they are the closest National Park to you. The Lakes isnt too far but you may want to do an over night for that. There is also the Peak District and North York Moors which are equally beautiful in their own ways. But I am not that familiar with them so cant properly recommend places. Malham Cove and Tarn  beautiful limestone cove with limestone pavements and a the highest lake in England is also one of the rarest types of lake in Europe Ribblehead Viaduct  stunning Victorian brickwork railway viaduct cutting its way though the Yorkshire Dales going past the Iconic Yorkshire Three Peaks  Ingleborough Whernside and PenyGhent. You can take a train from Leeds to Carlisle which is one of the most beautiful train journeys in the country. Fountains Abbey  Stunning remains of an abbey which historical owned a huge area of the Yorkshire Dales and land around Lancashire. Big deer park. Masham and Leyburn across to Richmond  Great towns to visit with a good bit of history attached to them. Masham has two breweries.  Gordale  A limestone ravine which is said to be the inspiration of Helms Deep from Lord of the Rings and the nearby Ribble Valley is said to be the Shire York  Really easy drive or train journey away well worth a visit Hubberholme and Wharfedale  The church at Hubberholme has some amazing carvings of Mice on the pews within the church worth a visit if your going up Wharefdale as are Kettlewell and Grassington.,Leeds,cnistmp,3,t5_2sklh
