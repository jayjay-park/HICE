820995,0,t3_23jdpq,Short answer yes.Longer answer the idea of a  mile oneway trip with charging available at each end makes the commute not only possible but a no brainer.  Yes it might take a bit of work to configure your charging but even in the apartment you can do some rapid charging with a bit of work.  Even with nothing but the  volt outlet available you can recharge your car overnight with ease and with a  to  converter box you could recharge a  mile ride in a couple of hours.Yesterday we drove the Leaf about  miles and still had  or more miles left on the battery when we got home again.  Thats fairly typical for this kind of weather but we wont get that kind of milage out of the batteries when its cold.  Then we only get  to  miles total our of the battery pack.Still youre only needing to do that one way.  If there is a quick charger any where near where you live and you use half of your battery getting home  minutes would allow you to top off and have a full battery for the next day when you can then fully charge at work.I save  per month on my fuel bills per month after considering the difference in gasoline and electricity and thats not including oil changes air filters emissions testing etc.  Of course I own my home and have a  volt EVSE installed in my garage and I dont actually commute to work I work from home so all of our trips are local runs to the high school or to the grocery store or to visit friends or family.,leaf,cgxlkzz,3,t5_2sfej
826041,0,t3_23jdpq,If you have a J charge point located near your house or you can have one installed then its a no brainer.Charging at v is going to be a little iffy. You can recover  kWh   miles in  hours overnight so youre probably okay in most cases. If you do significant driving while at home then you may run into trouble.Dont run an extension cable out across walkways. If you cant park closer to the house where you can avoid this I would hold off on purchasing a LEAF.Also consider how easy or difficult it will be to charge if you move.,leaf,cgy67re,2,t5_2sfej

If theyd say that theyll allow you to upgrade to a larger battery down the line when better tech is available and  that the car will be able to fully utilize the additional mileage then that would make the car more valuable.

7058659,0,t3_4c8eij,Heavy traffic isnt a problem for the leaf.  There isnt a lot of battery use unless youre spinning the wheels andor youre blasting heat or to a lesser extent AC.  Generally you should consider the distance and not the time it takes to get there traffic.  Ive found three things affect range  Hills.  Hills eat batteries fast.  Although of course you conserve batteries by going down hill.  Temperature.  Especially cold.  The batteries dont work as well and you also lose range by running your heater.  This can be up to  ! of total range when it really cold but being in the bay area this wont affect you.  Speed.  Youll get much more range going mph compared to mph over the same track.  This is the opposite of a gas car and is why driving in traffic isnt a problem.Id say if you get one of the new SV or SL leafs with the bigger batteries then you should be for fine for a really long time.  If you get a standard leaf with only  miles of range you might be cutting it close in certain situations.  Are you able to charge at your destination?If youre buying new you could consider the Volt which has a similar pure EV range.  Good luck!EDIT I just reread this.

I wish my leaf got about  more miles per charge...the  model will.  If you are going to buy new you should probably just wait until this fall.Its my favorite car I have owned.  And I deeply loved my s era Nissan hardbody PU and my s era Mercedes Diesels.  No maintenance freedom from gas stations quiet comfortable cabin with a high stance on the road and great visibility.  Very roomy cargo area and backseat as well.I think the exterior is UGLY but that is point of personal preference and doesnt diminish from all the outstanding features especially at the price.Mine was a CPO which splits the difference between new and used from a private seller.  Might be something you want to consider as it provides a really nice extended warranty but at a used car price.No rebates though.,leaf,df210rc,2,t5_2sfej
