5943740,0,t3_3wsl8e,gtThis is great for HRC is the short runto watch MSNBC or CNN her race to the nomination is a cakewalkbut it means she is not firetested should she win the nomination. Every other nominee in recent history has been firetested before the general. In  for example Obama had been worked over on Reverend Wright and his dubious Chicago funders by HRC and others in the primary race. By the general McCain could get no traction with those issues.Youre kidding right? The GOP has hammered on Hillary since  the most recent of which was Benghazi panel  which led to her having an  hour grilling where she shamed them thoroughly and came out on top looking presidential and the GOP having nothing but a growing scandal of their own that they were wasting tax dollars on a witch hunt to try to make Hillary unpopular.Theres a reason why you dont hear anything else about that special panel  The GOP is trying to shut it down as quietly as possible without making any noise.As for the debate schedule it was decided long before any candidates were announced so its nonsensical to point at it as being designed to be unfair for Bernie. Besides the debates have not been a strong point for Bernie going by the polls so its probably better for him that there arent more anyway.The Sanders camp is looking like Ron Paul . by pointing out conspiracies everywhere like the supposed media blackout... Hah Sanders got plenty of media coverage over the summer when he was new and fresh but he refuses to say anything new and even demands reporters not to ask about ISIS and terrorism during a news conference... Whoops.  They dont talk about him because he doesnt offer up anything new he says the same thing over and over again and refuses to detail out his biggest selling point to his fans his tax plan where he would actually pay for all those trillions of dollars of promises he keeps pandering out to those big grassroots crowds.Bernie is torpedoing himself. Terrorism is the  issue on everybodys minds right now and he continues to beat his Blame the  drum. ,hillaryclinton,cxyr5vw,9,t5_2u1c9

In order to win Iowa cleanly I think she needs a decent endorsement that has some activist power in Iowa. Is there another group that hasnt endorsed in Iowa with a force of volunteers? Makes me think that they should have waited on the Tom Harkin endorsement until now would have been a great counter to the good week Sanders is having. Of course no way could they see how strong of a contender Sanders was going to be so its a mistake in hindsight but certainly not a mistake at the time. ,hillaryclinton,cyxyan8,7,t5_2u1c9

6273572,0,t1_cz2fvef,Sorry I tried scrolling through some of the fact sheets but didnt find what I was looking for.  Any chance you could point me to toward the tax plan that shows how she will pay for all of the proposals that shes made?  Im referring to whatever documents she meant when she said I have actually documented every way that Im going to pay for what Im doing because I think the American public deserves to know. And you can go to my website and actually see that.Are there specifics for what tax rates she will implement what loopholes will be closed etc?  Im not trying to be obtuse here.  Im just trying to piece together a cohesive policy from these various fact sheets.  Is there any place where theyre all tied together into a comprehensive proposal?For example the Infrastructure fact sheet says Clinton would increase federal infrastructure funding by  billion over a fiveyear period fully paying for these investments through business tax reform.  Where is her proposal for business tax reform?Also Im looking at the Plan for Lowering OutofPocket Health Care Costs to see what she means by build on the ACA.  It lists Build on the Affordable Care Act and require plans to provide three sick visits without counting toward deductibles every year and Provide a new progressive refundable tax credit of up to  per family for excessive outofpocket costs.Im no economist but wouldnt the first bullet increase insurance premiums?  I cant imagine that the insurance companies will just eat that cost.  Am I missing something?  The second bullet says This tax cut will be fully paid for by demanding rebates from drug manufacturers and asking the most fortunate to pay their fair share.  Are there specifics available on that?  What kind of rebates are we talking about?  What fair share?Is the fair share part referring to her fourpercent Fair Share Surcharge on Americans who make more than  million per year?  That fact sheet says she will not raise taxes on middleclass families and has already proposed tax relief for college and health care costs but makes no mention of the health insurance fact sheet.  It also says She has also said she would end the carried interest loophole and close loopholes and tax expenditures that benefit multimillionaires.  What exactly does she mean by that and how much income is it expected to produce?Im sure shes added more detail in other fact sheets but Im having trouble assembling it all to get the big picture.  Is there another site that does a fair job of presenting her policy proposals in a more cohesive manner?Thank you!,hillaryclinton,cz2qg3i,0,t5_2u1c9

6277598,1,t1_cz3295i,I think you would agree with OPs article because it makes largely the same point. It agrees that a lot of Sanders plans are basically fluff papered over with sloganeering. He needs to show some interest in and grasp of foreign policy. The Sanders camp can point to polls and say he needs to be taken seriously but should be warned that it comes with increased scrutiny. Both articles make the point that he just isnt prepared for that type of test. Between his ideas about policy and politics he is saying a lot of things that are simply fanciful. If he wants to be more than just a novelty he has to offer something more serious than wish fulfillment for the left. ,hillaryclinton,cz36xaz,6,t5_2u1c9

6295719,0,t1_cz56y0a,I would like to mention I didnt say more moral  and I dont think youll here many Clinton supporters say she is MORE moral than him... But I would argue they are equal.. First of all being neutral and anti gay are  different things. She was very neutral and didnt speak much about the topic. Sanders was openly pro gay earlier but they are both the same now I dont think it matters who was it earlier... Im worried about now cuz she didnt become president forever ago And personally I still support the decision to go to Iraq.. I just dont think we did a good job once we got there. People may not like it but we cant just ignore countries that are causing problems. The US is there to help all its allies. Every country went there... The problem is that we tried to shove democracy down their throats and didnt truly help the people restabilize the country... So after we pulled out everything went to hellBut overall I dont vote for Hillary for her stances. They are close enough to Bernie to be practically irrelevant... But she has more experience and is much more willing to compromise with Republicans... She also has more experience in foreign affairs where Bernie has ... Bernie will be OK as president. But every Republican will do everything they can to stop that socialist and he will accomplish nothing because he wont try and work with them. He will fight those Republicans until he gets exactly what he wants... Which he wont . Hillary will try and make the US a better place and she will do anything to get us there. My favorite way to think about it is that Bernie wants to up heave the entire government and country in  years. Noone is going to let that happen and it just isnt realistic. We need to take small steps in the right direction. I think Hillary is realistic and can take those steps better than anyone else  I hope this helped a bit p I enjoy discussion,hillaryclinton,cz592vr,3,t5_2u1c9

You know how the core Sanders supporters behave when they imagine theyre getting a raw deal  just wait until they have something plausible to latch onto. No what the Superdelegates are useful for is clinching  so that you can say to the other guy or girl that its time to throw in the towel before youve won a majority of pledged delegates. Her Superdelegate lead combined with a good showing on Super Tuesday may mean that Sanders doesnt make it to lose on March th which could save two weeks and a few million dollars.,hillaryclinton,cz74cjy,3,t5_2u1c9

MasonDixon has a solid rating from FiveThirtyEight.I expect Iowa to be a close call probably closer than a  point margin. But I predict Clinton will edge Sanders out. Im willing to concede New Hampshire but then again I dont really care about New Hampshire as losing that state wont put a dent in Clintons campaign.

6386282,0,t1_czfdmzg,They cant just go anywhere. They are assigned to their local precinct. So if theyre still registered at home then yes this will help some but otherwise they cant just be spread around.And honestly even if you send  or  Bernie supporters back to a particular hometown precinct which is the kind of numbers were talking about theyre not going to make a difference unless there is already a groundswell of support there. My understanding is that they have to represent at least  of the people in the building to get a delegate. Caucusing locally is really an awesome experience in democracy because it is just so inclusive and personally active. But its also a bit like the electoral college up close and personal. You dont win unless you can spread that love all over the state in significant numbers. Because Iowa democrats seem pretty pragmatic and mainstream in my experience and observation Ill be really surprised if Clinton doesnt win the democratic nomination in Iowa by whatever their equivalent of a landslide is.,hillaryclinton,czfjxjc,2,t5_2u1c9
6389989,0,t1_czfwbuz,gtHow is this bad? Are they saying that it should be legal to sell violent games to children?I think it is bad.  Im against legally enforced rating systems except for pornography. The science to support the claim that violent media makes disturbed violent children is way too contradictory and flimsy to support laws that restrict important freedoms like speech and information for minors.I also find the suggestion by these efforts that all media rated for mature audiences is trash to be prudish and narrowminded.  A signficant majority of Oscar winning films are rated R.  Theres no reason whatsoever someone should be restricted from watching  Years A Slave or Unforgiven because theyre under the age of .  Theyre highly acclaimed works of art.Having said that I dont really care about any of this as a voting issue because Im not  and this kind of hysteria about violent video games and gangsta rap ended a decade ago so its not even part of the discussion its only being used to pad out this guys list.,hillaryclinton,czfz4tp,3,t5_2u1c9

6395686,0,t1_czgb6zf,For the record the MPAA rating system and ESRB rating system are selfregulating organizations and are thus entirely voluntary they are not law nor are they legally enforceable in any way.  You cannot get in legal trouble for selling a Rated M video game or an R rated movie ticket to a minor.Some attempts have been made to make them legally enforceable Brown v EMA the one in question that Clinton was involved with but as you mention they fail due to first amendment issues.  Just because its not legally enforceable doesnt mean its not enforceable in some way though.  MPAA and ESRB ratings work because most everyone voluntarily follows the rules these organizations set forth with the threat that if they dont then they dont get the benefits following the rules grants them.  If a video game or movie doesnt submit for review most retailers wont sell it.  Consoles wont license a game if it doesnt have an ESRB rating.  If a theater or retailer dont follow age restrictions they could face backlash and possible restriction on what content they are given to sell in the future.

From the articlegt The key takeaway from our model below in order for Sanders to be on track to break even in pledged delegates nationally he wouldnt just need to win Iowa and New Hampshire by a hair.

6447398,0,t3_43ygvc,You dont and you dont need to. Bernie mightve won that demo by  but that demo was only  of the Iowa turnout. In fact the one thing to come out of Iowa was that Bernie needs to either win that demo bv an even larger amount or make inroads with other demos. Bernie can win the  demo all day long and hes still going to lose the primaries by a landslide.Hillary gave an amazing interview yesterday with Chris Matthews where she gave a really good point she wants to bring back the Democrats to the middle. Thats going to cost her ideologue support in the primaries but its going to win her the general. Sure its going to piss off the far left loons of the Democratic Party but thats a good thing. The thing that those people and a lot of Bernie supporters dont understand is that we dont have a monarchy. We dont elect  person who then accomplishes everything they set out to do. The next President is going to have to work with a Republican House and likely a Republican Senate. And  very good way to start laying the groundwork to work with a Republican Congress is start appealing to Republican moderates. We are not the idiotic party that puts lunatics like Palin so TrumpRubioCruz that have no crossparty appeal come November.Stop trying to win internet arguments with BernieBots. You cant flip an idealogue and even worse you might embarass yourself to a reader that sees your comment and is on the fence.Edit Go here CTRLF On most political matters do you consider yourself and look at those results. Clinton crushes the Somewhat liberal  and Moderate  metric of people who selfidentify and Sanders only wins people who selfidentify as Very liberal . Winning the extremes of the party and only the extreme of the party is a fantastic way to win primaries and lose generals.

Presidential candidates who are serious about doing the job theyd be elected to do take an active role in learning about foreign policy. By all account Sanders is not interested in foreign policy even coming from his own team of foreign policy experts. Obama at this point was being advised daily by several foreign policy heavyweights. Hell even when Obama was in the Senate he made foreign policy a huge part of his docket. Sanders is not interested in foreign policy and thats perhaps one of the biggest roles a president plays in American politics.

So heres my uneducated guess... if Im like others I want people to choose for themselves and dont like a lot of authority figures making rules for everyone.  With that being said Im HUGE on playing fairly and by the rules.  And as I see it Im procapitalism but I see that our system is rigged to favor the rich and rich corporations.

Does this person support a majority of issues that are important to me.If I can answer yes to ANY one of those questions then that person will move on to to the next set of questions that are important to me. If there was a Republican that received a yes to any of above then they would move forward.It just so happens that both Sanders and Clinton and OMalley have at least one yes that qualifies them moving onto the next set of questions. Bachmann? All nos. Trump? All nos. Bush? No. Rubio? No. Warren? Yes.Obviously everybody has their own set of questions that they use to evaluate candidates. As an aside Ive heard that one of the last questions people ask themselves is Can I envision this person running a war as the Commander in Chief?This is all pretty basic stuff.

Oh right thats pretty much exactly what obama has been doing. Okay so far... gt And then democrats push the bill again and again until the backlash of the population is too much and the republicans pass it because thats how you do politics. And we go off the rails again here though. Backlash of the population? Who??? Liberal people in liberal districts? Why would republicans care about that? Its like you guys dont realize that republican voters exist. gt You dont start at the compromise position and then give into the other side. You start as far in your corner as you can and you make the republicans come to your side. Something that Bernie has a terrible record at doing in the senate yet Hillary has a great record of. gt Bernie has fought for decades to help the majority of Americans and you can be sure that hell work tirelessly as president to push through legislation that continues that agenda.No he will be stubborn and alienating and extreme just like he exactly has been for decades and nothing will get done.

However we did give the nation Rick Santorum sorry so so sorry.President Obama called us yes specifically us in rural Pennsylvania biblethumping gunclinging xenophobes and then he won Pennsylvania in the general because we said Oh well thats kinda true. While everyone elses congressperson said they didnt want the Guantanamo detainees in their districts a Pennsylvania congressman John Murtha said wed be happy to have them. I recall this because FOX news thought this was a slam dunk against this longstanding Democratic congressman and sent a crew to ask regular people what they thought. And every single one of them said they thought it was a great idea to build the facility in their district. The FOX anchor was flabbergasted.I organized at my university and in my county for Hillary in  and people were excited about her. They wanted to see her as President all for different reasons but the prevailing sentiment was that as Hillary now states in her stump speeches the economy simply does better under a Democratic president.Rest assured the keystone state will live up to its name and deliver a decisive victory for Hillary.

6765687,0,t3_48f19m,I was a wee baby th grader in  but I voted for Obama in my first election in .  Im very proud of his presidency but not because of his  message. Im proud of the way he responded to the sometimes very personal and irrational opposition that crystallized against him after the  midterms. He eventually got down in the trenches and fought quite effectively on behalf of people like me. Im so proud of his list of accomplishments despite the unprecedented vicious and petty republican opposition. I most of all admire his levelheaded and cerebral response to unfair or disingenuous criticism. But despite all of this I think he should be running right now and Hillary should be retiring after  years. He ended up fulfilling her campaigns realist vision of politics and probably did so less skillfully than she would have after having to adjust his strategy. She also would have understood the necessity of building relationships in congress immediately while democrats and republicans complained about Obama failing to reach out to them in the beginning. He now has to lean on Biden to be his administrations connection with congress because of the respect and friendship he built amongst his colleagues. Hillary has had these strong crossparty connections for years and Obama would have benefitted from  years in the senate to build a similar base of respect. Hes certainly been an inspiration for my own approach to politics and Im glad to have grown up with him as an example but I think Hillary was really the better choice in . And Im sure she would have been just as good of an example. ,hillaryclinton,d0j64zw,13,t5_2u1c9
6766237,0,t3_48ezil,I think a lot of people feel the way you do. You gave Bernie and Hillary a close and honest look. Originally you thought fairly that Bernies candidacy had its merits and justified your support. But over the past few months Bernie his campaign and most of all the reddit Sanders Brigade have engaged in really nasty and contrived personal attacks against Hillary. For a candidate who brags that he has never run a negative campaign and that he will never accept help from a Super PAC he sure has no problem with his supporters as well as a few proBernie PACs spreading misinformation about Hillary. I think its gotten so aggressive that people on the fence like you have asked themselves is Hillary really as terrible as they say? And then once you do your own research you realize that all of this antiHillary rhetoric is just that politically motivated smears against an enormously qualified and progressive candidate. Of course all of this is to say nothing of Hillarys objectively impressive credentials and platforms and Bernies single issue candidacy and lack of comparatively impressive foreign policy experience. So it makes total sense how the Slash and Bern politics of the Sanders campaign and the reddit Sanders Brigade could backfire. Welcome to Hillarys campaign. We are supporting the most qualified wellrounded and honest candidate in this race  on either side of the aisle. Dont let anyone especially the reddit Sanders Brigade make you feel bad for your sincerely held political beliefs. ,hillaryclinton,d0j8dta,14,t5_2u1c9

6792857,0,t1_d0m8uj7,I dont know how people dont see that Socialist countries are not consumer capitalist nations. America is addicted to consumption. Northern Europe is not. Now Im not an expert or anything but at least Ive been to Sweden Finland and Denmark. Their houses are small. Their cars are smaller and older. They bike and walk a lot have tiny vacation homes that are basically shacks that they keep in the family for generations and eat out infrequently. Consumerism is not anywhere close to what it is here.If we want that sort of democratic socialism we have to give up a lot of consumption. Its not sustainable. And furthermore Im a pretty big environmentalist. Consumption at the rate were going at is not compatible with a healthy planet. Im not an idealist when it comes to technology either and I think that big tech companies that make billions and employ few are going to really really harm our economy.Which is also why Im inherently skeptical of companies like Yelp Amazon Valve and Spotify that make money producing absolutely nothing other than an artificial technological barrier between producers and consumers.We dont need easier faster cheaper ways to consume. We need less consumption. Democratic socialist countries understand that. The American economy does not. And neither do Sanders supporters.Editgt And am in a similar situation as you okay youre maybe doing a little better.If you want to see your net worth quantite by age I like this nifty tool Were better off than all but  of our age group .

6794979,1,t1_d0mhh56,gt Personally I believe that the world will inevitably tend toward and ought to freer trade.I would agree that it inevitably will.  As for ought to then its really going to depend on what freer means.  The problem as I see it is is free trade has been conflated with trade between nations period.  What free trade means to me based on the TPP and past agreements is highly deregulated trade with provisions to ensure corporate rights over those of people.Sanders is not antitrade.  He just wants trade agreements that provide environmental and workers protections with the same level of enforcement as we provide rights to trade.gt She decided then that she couldnt support it because of the human rights concerns which shows at least I think better judgement than outright rejecting it preemptively like Sanders did.Most people familiar with the issue knew roughly what was going to be included.  Search for TPP is worse than we thought and youll get an idea of what people knew were in it... the final text just confirmed and exacerbated those concerns.Also Id be curious if you have information about her specific concerns that relate to human rights.  Obviously we cant know the version she claims to have been the gold standard as that was purely private but I could certainly get an idea based on specifics whether or not these were left by the wayside or were integral.  I cant imagine it went through that massive of a transformation but Im open.  Also has she made any mention of how the version she supported  lobbied for differed?gt If she came out tomorrow and said she supported it I personally would not care because I tentatively support it on the basis of free trade mostly taking a neutral stance where I think each deal should be assessed individually.It wouldnt bother you that she claims now there are human rights violations and then goes on to support something which by her own words codifies human rights violations?,hillaryclinton,d0mi1wj,0,t5_2u1c9

But globalization hasnt been good for everyone and its not shocking that some people just want the changes to stop.

Ive heard about reports from her aids when she asks for a briefing and they give her a  page document and expect never to hear about it again... then she follows up the next week with sickie notes on the whole thing and detailed questions about an item on pg .She was the most widely traveled secretary of state ever and her reputation around the globe is pretty much the polar opposite of her reputation on Reddits front page. She nearly ran herself into the ground working for Obama and our country.She plays the game it is true. She plays by the rules that were written long before she came long.

6824947,0,t1_d0pvxy3,For software I mean things like WindowsOffice musicvideophoto editing enterprise software lots of very expensive proprietary software are pirated and used in TPP countries d modeling etc. Even basic accounting software like quickbooks all the way up to expensive Oracle DB software or SAS analytics software.  I think you should separate packaged software from the underlying CS principles thats more patent than copyright anyway.Now I agree with open source software in principle. Im glad there are people that work on it.  But I dont hate proprietary paid software.  Industry and capitalism creates competition and a race to create more features with more polish.  Compare SAS to R or Excel to LibreOffice.  Both can solve many of the same problems but R has severe limitation that SAS easily solves for those willing to pay for the solution.  Likewise power users of excel of which there are s of thousands worldwide for analysis and reporting will never be satisfied with current limitations of libreoffice. Bridging that gap would require far more developers and engineers contributing and its just not feasible.  I think many people underestimate the degree to which very expensive CS and SW engineering expertise goes into creating commercial software.  There is a lot of proprietary advancements in DB technology behind many of Oracles features.  You can try and form a team of open source developers to replicate them. They might get close on many but it would take an army of experts to reach full feature parity with the same performance. Commercial software is a very important industry to the US and employees huge numbers of white collar US workers not just the engineering team but product manager marketing sales finance etc.  Their products would hugely benefit from strong WW copyright protections just like the US movie television gaming and book industries.  ,hillaryclinton,d0pwnlt,5,t5_2u1c9

As one myself there are many of us who support you wholeheartedly. I grew up in the s and remember always seeing you on TV as the First Lady fighting for Healthcare and being an awesome role model for young girls like me. I always felt that if you ever ran for President that I would vote for you. Unfortunately I was just a few months shy of  to be able to vote for you in  but I am so happy you are running again! I feel you are the only candidate that is actually offering a pragmatic and sensible platform plus you are clearly the most qualified!

6843752,0,t3_49ih0q,I think when you consider that many of Sanders proposals simply wont pass congress you come to the realization that Hillary is the better candidate and her platform has been more thought out with the objective of actually getting things done. She doesnt make promises she cant keep Sanders supporters forget that president Obama was never for single payer healthcare nor did he advocate that Wall Street bankers should be jailed. Obama did support a public option but that was dropped during negotiations because blue dog democrats and republicans didnt like it. It appears however that there is a provision in the ACA set to go into effect in  that would allow states to opt into what would be akin to a public option this is what Hillary said she would push for in order to cover those that are currently uninsured. A lot of Sanders supporters kind of made Obama out to be something that he wasnt in their own minds when they voted for him. Hillary is far closer to Obama than Sanders and many voters are realistic and dont think he can get his proposals through congress. If Sanders fails to get his proposals through congress then he would be forced to compromise or get nothing done he would then invoke the ire of those now supporting him and become another failure like Obama. I just dont think Sanders is a good choice progress will be made incrementally and eventually we will get to where we want to be. ,hillaryclinton,d0s1ms9,21,t5_2u1c9

6854653,0,t1_d0t7a5v,If we can make coverage affordable for everyone and more importantly if we can decrease out of pocket costs which is Hillarys focus at present. Underinsurance is a much bigger problem than uninsurance see the documentary you mentioned does it really matter that insurance companies profit? At the end of the day all I really care about is that everyone has access to affordable healthcare. Everyone wins.There are logistical problems with Bernies plan. It is prudent to enact cost controls which would make moving towards single payer down the line more feasible. Every health policy wonk Ive read I read a lot this is also on the top of my list of concerns agrees with this. Of course if you only listen to Bernie his plan is very appealing. He paints it as all puppies and rainbows but hes being totally unrealistic. Theres no way he can offer comprehensive coverage eliminate all out of pocket costs and have no treatment denials with the taxes hes proposing.Hillary has been fighting for universal healthcare since   and has been for the pubic option since  it was a new idea at the time. Insurance companies lobby against the public option because they know it will be hard to compete with it and they will lose customers and may even go out of business. And if everyone gets on the pubic option guess what thats single payer! A much smoother transition I think.,hillaryclinton,d0ta7ar,3,t5_2u1c9

The people who work with her like her a lot. You read interviews with people who work with her even ones that are critical of her and a common theme appears in all of them Hillary Clinton is nothing like the media makes her out to be she is warm kind considerate and without ego. Hillary Clinton is someone who cares about you but it is hard to portray that because she does it by actually listening to what you have to say and not talking at you. Many of these people are those who worked in Obamas campaign whose job it was to actively vilify her and she was nothing but gracious to them to a shocking degree. People who work with Hillary like her so much that we even have a section in our wiki that has republicans saying nice things about her You dont hear that about Sanders in fact you here the opposite There is even a quote about Sanders by Barney Frank back in  that said something along the lines of we didnt get stuff done because of Bernie Sanders we got stuff done in spite of him because his holierthanthou attitude almost killed the amendment without our work. The article about it is hereI think it is very telling that not a single person who has worked with both Sanders and Clinton in the senate has supported Sanders. The analogy I like to use for why Democrats pick Clinton over Sanders is this In a class election would you vote for your good friend who took notes for you when you were at your grandmas funeral and made sure that we had funding for the yearbook or vote for the guy who sits behind you in math class and sometimes lets you borrow a pencil. Clinton is the good friend Sanders is the guy with the pencil. ,hillaryclinton,d0tk1to,2,t5_2u1c9

False equivalence spreads easy. The general public probably still thinks the debt ceiling crises and government shutdown were due to the reluctance of both sides to compromise. Hell most of the antiestablishment Redditors have bought into that as well. People just do not pay attention to politics outside of Presidential election years.Obama ran on a platform of bipartisanship he had to keep up the image of trying or he would have risked losing support. Hillary is quite explicitly NOT running with any expectations of bipartisanship. She can enact a fully partisan agenda and start pushing executive orders through the minute she steps into office.

I grew up in the DC area with two parents on opposite sides of the political spectrum and I was really involved in faux debates in high school and man  really got to me. I was so convinced I should be able to testinto voting because I knew about the issues and wanted to vote and I felt that if I was informed theres no reason I shouldnt be able to.I kind of think I was right to this day. gt When I voted for Hillary in my states primary a couple of weeks ago I couldnt even look my father in the face the next time I went over for dinner. So I called Dad on his birthday. Of course its his freaking birthday and we start talking for a bit... and he lets the Donald bomb drop. My dad... Hes always been conservative and Ive always been argumentative. I bother him with facts. But I think he knew on his birthday I couldnt do a single thing so he lays into every reason hes going to vote for Donald. My father is married to a Mexican But shes a LEGAL mexican and has  daughters me and my sister and could give two shits if I have access to rights my body healthcare...

Its a representatives system so no matter how many or how few vote they all still represent the same number of people The entire basis of the article is that Bernie would need to get ahead in the delegate count for the Super Delegates to switch to his side. ,hillaryclinton,d0v58cv,7,t5_2u1c9

If there were and auto manufacturers resisted safety technology that could prevent people from plowing stolen cars into crowds for example one could make an argument for their culpability. Youre getting a lot of conflicting answers because courts have not been able to look at these questions to evaluate the applicability of various legal rationales in this case because of the immunity legislation.A lot of us take issue because the Senator opposed immunity for other industries for example fast food where he felt it appropriate to let the courts decide the issue but for some reason the firearms industry earned his special consideration. ,hillaryclinton,d0z209o,3,t5_2u1c9

During this primary season Ive had a tough time finding Clintons authenticity. I think that I now have a better appreciation for her having seen how she has had a consistent record in moving forward even if the details change over time. I was taken aback by her comments about the Reagans. Ive also been very impressed by her swift apology and how she used it as a learning opportunity. Shes handled this and many other questions about her character genuinely. I am also impressed by the deep thought and planning that goes into her policies. Clinton has earned my primary vote.

It included automaker and housing bailouts which were lossmaking whereas the other programs had positive returns. Calculating the rate of return on the program as a whole is complicated because the cash out and inflows occur irregularly over a period of several years. Also to the extent that TARP was funded by USG debt that would not have otherwise been issued it doesnt make sense to compare returns on those funds vs. some other hypothetical investment because the latter would not have occurred.

6931935,0,t3_4am17d,So .... continue doing exactly what weve been doing P. I do appreciate that Bernie had to flame out before most of his supporters would listen.  You really should dig into the differences between Bernie and Hillary on Climate Change btw.  Not only has she been vastly more active on that front than he has  not just in public life but also through the Clinton Climate Initiative in her charity work investing heavily in green energy and tree planting  but her policies are significantly better than Bernies.  Which is why all the environmental groups endorsed her over him.For one Bernie is a total NIMBY and his climate plan involved phasing out nuclear power  this would force us to rely more on coal to fill the role our current nuclear reactors fill which would be horrible for the environment.  Hillary understands that coal is far more dirty  and dangerous!  than nuclear.  She doesnt talk it up a lot because some voters are irrationally afraid of it but she doesnt scaremonger or plan to shut them down like Bernie and indicates her support for nuclear with phrases like we have to be open to all options when people try to get her to condemn it.Hillary also is tying jobs and the environment together by making green energy her jobs program.  She isnt the lesser of two evils.  She is legitimately better than Bernie.  Like significantly.  Hes got a good heart.  Shes got a good heart and a good head.  ,hillaryclinton,d1226kg,3,t5_2u1c9

Hillary followed the advice of her predecessors regarding the handling of emails and has admitted that it was a mistake. Keep in mind that she was a middleaged politician not a technology expert.  was before a lot of the largescale public security attacks took place. There should have been better policies. Someone more knowledgeable about online security should have been advising everyone on security measures. Someone dropped the ball and I do believe that Hillary has some responsibility in that but I also believe that she did not and would not intentionally do something to compromise our security.

The same vulgarity is not directed at male Sanders Trump or whichever other male presidential candidates supporters. But maybe it should. Maybe your above imagined candidate would actually not be popular with a section of Bernies supporters because they distrust women in power? There are people over in rsp still saying they will vote for Trump if they cant vote for Sanders. So they will vote for a candidate who has polar opposite positions who is running for the opposing party instead of voting for a female candidate who shares over  of the same platform?

6955862,0,t3_4ay06m,Im honestly just getting sick of this shit... Im convinced that upwards of  of the hate against Hillary is due to her being a woman and associated unconscious bias. I just am.Even female friends who dont support her speak in terms that are undoubtedly rooted in gender. Unfortunately telling a friend you think theyre being unconsciously sexist is a poor way to convince someone that theyre doing just that I could go on a whole separate rant about how you cant call anyones actions sexist without them assuming you think they always and forever openly hate women.  But I really do think its sexism. I think people trust Bernie because men who yell and tell it like it is are seen to fit exactly with the expected gender role of men as aggressive leaders. Women on the other hand are supposed to be delicate flowers so whenever Hillary gets passionate or yells its seen as inauthentic. And frankly many of these people are so angry over people like me calling them out that they have doubled down on the cognitive dissonance to such a degree that even years from now they may not realize their support for Senator Sanders over Senator Clinton is rooted in sexism same is true of trump supporters I just am not friends with any of those people. One of my female friends a Bernie supporter who will unenthusiastically support Hillary in the general has repeatedly said she refuses to support Hillary on the grounds of her gender... and she says it in this way that simultaneously demonizes those who may be voting for her because of her gender and plays on this fear that women are worried about being judged for supporting women candidates.... without realizing that much like black people women do not get to take off their skin when they enter a room. Gender matters in this race.

7023677,0,t1_d1ch4nq,Thanks for the votes hope that stops the timer from coming up in the future. Please remember that there are many trolls who are trump supporters on that sub who are using web extensions to downvote everything on that sub instantly after they are posted like I have mentioned in this post.  gt The voting brigade happens regularly in Bernies subreddit too even on posts like updating deadlines for registration. This voting brigade mostly comes from trump supporters who have a berniesanderssucks subreddit on their reddits sidebar. In that subreddit they once promoted an extension that downvoted all posts in sp subreddit. I have even see people with user names like sanders troll the both subreddits and regularly post in the trumps reddit. I think a good chunk of the same trump supporters vote brigade your sub too and the trumps subreddit has Hillarys image for downvote button. I am not denying that there are no Bernie supporters who vote brigade there are some such users but not a lot of them. I think its not good to generalize all of them as the same. If a majority of bernie supporters wanted to brigade it would be a different scenario as yesterday night I have seen as many as k users at times there. The set of Bernie supporters who do brigading is a very small minority as on average I see around k people on the sp subreddit every day. I hope this brings things into prescriptive. Now a suggestion to improve this situation. I think you can do what the trump subreddit does where you can vote only if you subscribe.As its a sanders subreddit you can have some overzealous supporters that are sensitive to posts sounding negative about Bernie. I have often upvoted and responded to posts that criticize Bernie in a constructive way. If you want to post anything was constructive and related to Bernie that got downvoted let me know.

My precinct went  delegates for Hillary to  delegates for Bernie none for uncommitted. Everyone in the room agreed that they would vote for Hillary in the upcoming election but that they wanted to vote for Bernie now to push her further left. Thats everyone who was a Bernie supporterI showed up and gave my speech for Hillary. There was a lot of misinformation about Hillarys policies and whether shes really as liberal as she says as well as a distinct misunderstanding of why Bill Obama and now Hillary are moderates in our current political state despite whatever policies they may have. There was a moment in which people verged on tone policing Hillary compared to Bernie but thankfully someone pointed out that that wasnt okay.Overall the experience was very stressful but Im glad I did it! ,hillaryclinton,d1em06i,30,t5_2u1c9

7046359,0,t1_d1f1gk8,I can tell you some of her actions that show how she thinks and break down how campaign finance reporting works. She authored and passed the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This law requires drug companies to conduct costly research trials on children as well as adults because children react to new pharmaceuticals differently than adults. She still receives money from pharmaceutical companies.She worked with Elizabeth Warren on creating the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Had she remained in the Senate she would have sponsored and passed it. The CFPB has refunded billions of dollars in corporate bogus action to consumers since . She still takes money from banks.She was the original target of attack ads that created Citizens United in the first place. Citizens United to Stop Hillary took out  minute infomercial spots to run hit pieces on Hillary in the lead up to the  Virginia primary. So there is a very personal motivation for her. To me attacking her for raising money after Citizens United is like judging a pedestrian who got hit by a car for buying a car so he doesnt have to walk through that intersection.She returned a  contribution from Walmart while she was in the Senate. The story of her tenure on Walmart is actually more interesting than she aint do nothing for labor and worth your time to research.Hillary pointing out that GOP candidates are bought and paid for matches with the actions of those candidates is accurate. Hillarys actions in contrast do not line up with her contributors. So I trust that because shes done it before shell do it again.Shes also been talking about it for a lot longer than a year and done it in the public eye. A month before Bernie entered the race she declared that overturning Citizens United would be her litmus test for her Supreme Court nominees. Two years ago in an appearance on The Daily Show she used her time to talk about wealth inequality. Now how can she take all that money from those corporations?The truth is she doesnt. Not from the corporations themselves so to speak. In the US people who donate to campaigns must declare their profession and employer as a part of making the donation.Campaign finance reporting in the media aggregates all the people from a single employer. So as for me the media doesnt report that ugreenerlantern donates mo to Hillary that gets lumped together with his other coworkers and instead you see that the store that killed Marshall Fields donated thousands and thousands of dollars and why does Hillary hate local department stores?That  that Hillary received from Goldman Sachs in donations?  came from employees.Sure some of that comes from people wanting to advance their employers interest. But some of it also came from people who support the cause and have money.  The billionaire Warren Buffet was the one who articulated the Buffet Rule that he should not be allowed to pay less in taxes than his secretary. A lot of rich people will be rich no matter the situation and vote on social issues. Lots of rich people went to hippie liberal arts schools where they learned about leftist politics  off the top of my head Steve Jobs dropped out of Reed College.Painting everything as black and white deprives one of seeing the vivid colors and shades of gray and all the power that one can harness from that space.,hillaryclinton,d1f29q2,5,t5_2u1c9

Id like to see public funding instant runoff voting and better access for voters ultimately but the public funding is idealism talking. Pretending like the presidency is for sale is just... detached from reality.As an aside the whole Republicans for Hillary phenomenon is really heartening in this political climate. Particularly because the Republicans who Clinton and Kasich attract tend to be economic moderates with respect for science and no dearly held racism and sexism. This represents many of the people who I interact with and value in my daily life. Despite me being far left of center Ive come as Ive gotten older to value relationships more and ideological purity less. My shift from Bernie supporter to Clinton supporter reflects that.

Wouldnt these two policies be attractive to his supporters? They are to me. They seem like obvious methods to increase tax revenue to pay for more programs and likely resonate with many liberals no? Marijuana is at least on the horizon legal in what  states?And gun control. How the fuck do the people in love with Bernie in my experience largely very liberal people continue to be blind to his avoidance of the topic and his ties to the NRA? While simultaneously attacking Hillarys character regarding Wall Street. We were seeing national coverage on different mass shootings almost every week leading up to Januaryish.

Almost  million dollars that she has raised at a max of  per person or corporation just like Bernie.The largest bundler for her campaign committee is the University of California. The second largest bundler is Emilys List an organization devoted to getting more women elected in politics at every level they probably run a workshop in your area. Surely one of the smallest bundlers is this very subreddit which as raised over  one hillionaire at a time.Edited to add My point is we dont all know that Clintons campaign is heavily funded by special interests.Edit  Back of the envelope calculations show that about  million dollars of Hillarys campaign contributions were from donations of less than . Thats the same amount as has been raised by all proClinton PACs combined.Edit  Hm I am interpreting Open Secrets incorrectly.

Dems dont want to sue just ANY manufacturer or dealer that sells a gun that is later used for a crime they want the ability to sue irresponsible gun manufacturers and and reckless dealers that sell their guns to criminals. For example there was a case Adames VS Beretta where a  year old boy took the clip off his fathers handgun thinking it was safe and ended up shooting his friend accidentally. The victims family tried to sue Beretta saying that the manufacturer should have made the gun safer and provided more warnings. The case was thrown out citing PLCAA which Sanders voted for. The freaking case would not even be HEARD This is just crazy. No other industry has this type of immunity but because of the gun lobby this particular multimillion dollar industry does.

7120666,0,t3_49zjik,Dear Hillary ClintonI am writing this in hopes that you do get to read it. It is rather long but in order to tell my story I need to write it. I have a story to tell about me and my life since your husband was first elected President and just how important it is for me that you be elected too.You may not remember me but I was the artist who sent three prints to Arkansas when President Clinton was first elected. It was the only three that I had at the time. It was my way of congratulating him at the time. Within nine days of receiving them he wrote me a thank you letter which I still have and cherish. I had just started my career as an artist traveling and doing art shows. The thing that excited me most about President Clinton was they way he got people motivated and seeing the bright things in life. He was so upbeat. During his administration my business grew. At an art show I would have people on one side of my booth pulling art off and other customers on the right side doing the same. And they were buying. I had my best years ever and was able to buy equipment my own printer and I became self published. Before I hired my printing done. That was key in getting people to buy from me. They felt good about this country and good about themselves and the middle class was coming back again.Then when George W. Bush was running against Al Gore my dream shattered literally right in front of me. I remember being at an art show in Atlanta with TN sign over my head and being touted by Republicans. I had a rather large booth and this guy looked at my sign and started to downgrade everything President Clinton had done and telling me about the recession and on and on he went as I walked across the front of my booth. I told him I was scared because the first thing people stop buying in a recession was art and the last thing they buy in a recovery is art. He kept saying I would be fine. I told him Prove it to me. Buy something. He kept walking. He did not buy a thing.Then the recount happened and the election as far as I know was stolen from Al Gore and my art died. Sales dropped off. People stopped buying from me. I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in  which took me away from my art too. It was the size of a softball and the only way it would kill me was with size and it nearly did just that. During my recovery I sat on my front porch and read your book Living History. You had just released it. I got to know you quite well and you helped me stop worrying about my future. But I now had a pre existing illness and that meant my husband would always have to work so I could get the health care I now needed and live. While GW Bush was in office I saw everything I had worked for fall apart.But after President Obama was elected I started to see a turn around in sales but tragically in  I was hit while walking by a drunk driver on drugs in an F. Those injuries set me back and it would take more than three years before I could get back on the road again. I worked so very hard to get back. When the Sandy Hook massacre happened I remember walking through my living room saying I had to do something. I had not painted anything in almost three years and I went in my patio room with my feline leukemia kitty at my right foot and painted all  victims in a painting called Innocence to give to them. I learned a lot about each one and a lot about myself in the process. I tried but was unsuccessful in giving it to them. It now sits in my closet. They are so lifelike and I painted each the same age as the day they were taken from us. When I finished each one I would tell their story and say  was taken before heshe could chase their dreams. I changed colors to match their favorite colors and I can still name each one. I am hoping one day it will find a home. So the gun issue is real to me. Every time I see another massacre I think of those four months I spent with them and how those families have to relive what happened to them. I know for a fact that you as a mother and grandmother will not stand and tell this country about continued butchering of our children. That is what it is. You will do something about it.My brain tumor started to grow again and I had to have another Gamma knife surgery. It seemed no matter what I did something kicked me back. I have lived with the worry of not getting insurance should my husband die or lose his job since  and when the ACA was put in place I finally could breathe again. THEN Congress was handed to the Republicans and my worries started all over again. He will have to work forever to keep me alive should they take it away. In  I had two surgeries one for a ruptured tendon in my right thumb because a plate ruptured it after being put in place for a broken wrist and back surgery for the injury I had from getting hit by the drunk driver. My entire year was wiped out. And none of it has been any fault of my own. I have to have MRIs the rest of my life for this tumor.When I saw that you were running for President I had hope for the first time again since your husband was in the White House. President Obama gave me the ACA but the hate that is felt towards him has constantly kept me worrying they will do away with it. The Republicans keep trying to repeal it. And if a Republican gets the White House I will die if my husband cannot work forever. Many other people in this country will die as well.This has been a very long letter to you. I realize that. But it was important for me to write this to you to tell you that I support you  and know that you will make a great President. You are so unfairly busy defending the attacks handed to you by the Republicans. But through it all I am hearing your message. I dont think people are excited about anything. I think you can bring that excitement and HOPE back to this country. When you have that in your life the hate and the negativity goes away and people can work together. They will want to work together.I once traveled to Abingdon VA to stand in line with one of my new prints to give to President Clinton only to be turned away. I have always wanted to meet the man who if only briefly gave me the chance to sell my art and help my husband pay the bills. One day maybe I can meet him and maybe one day I can meet you as the new President of the US. Hopefully my medical issues will stop causing me issues so I can do what I love to do.Stress has a way of interfering with healing.Hope has a great way of helping everyone heal.This country needs to heal and you Hillary Clinton can cause that healing to happen.I support you  Hillary Clinton You WILL be my NEXT PresidentI will always have HOPEKim Ward ArtistYou can read my story and see the three art prints on my website which does view better on a computer than a mobile device ,hillaryclinton,d1nj8zs,5,t5_2u1c9

7127908,1,t3_4d61zt,The race is far closer than it was a year ago. Hell its far closer than it was six weeks ago. Clinton had a  point lead and is currently sitting with an  point lead. in the pollsI dont see how the media is being too generous to a candidate that has received far less coverage than she has while out fundraising her has beat her in  state. etc.None of this is a swipe against Clinton. But trying to be real about the race. It is far closer than it was ever expected to be and Sanders for the first time in a year has a very small window in which he could grab the nom.Honestly I think this has more to do with Wasserman having some backtracking more than anything else. But Sanderss momentum is likely to be stalled by New York Clintons home state on April .That was a little over a week ago. And since her polls numbers have been cut in half in NY. Siena had her at  at the beginning of March. Two days ago CBS has her at  Quinnipiac has her at .If Clinton wants to win she needs to continue the same strategy and hope it lasts long enough to hold off the Sanders surge. If she takes NY Sanders is essentially done. But if NY upsets and goes to Sanders Wasserman and everyone else saying Sanders wasnt in this race is going to look like an absolute fool.,hillaryclinton,d1od1s4,0,t5_2u1c9

7150222,0,t3_4dfuzo,Alright guys... Today is going to be a big day for Benchmark Politics. Wisconsin is an important state. Weve been refining our state model more and more as time has gone on and our partnership with DDHQ has given us access to awesome data. We will be working with privately run exit polls today! You will be able to get very fast access to exit polls as soon as it is ok for us to release them at our site. This is very exciting for us and should make our calls today even MORE accurate than normal.  uapostleian and I have worked very hard over the past week to ensure that you guys would have stats county by county on EVERY state as well as expectations that can be set high. Well hopefully save you some nailbiting tonight and give you fun stuff to watch!This next part will sound familiar to all of youBefore reading Please read the how to guide on using the Benchmark model. It has EXAMPLES! I would also suggest you read our PostMichigan Analysis where we show you EXACTLY how we called a state like Michigan correctly.People have highly encouraged me to move my stuff to a single consolidated place and this will serve the job well. Throughout this primary season and beyond I will be posting models like this that allow you to follow along with on primary night and not act confused. Watch with purpose. That is the point of all of this to be able to say with data and analytics to back it up that one candidate or another is doing good or bad using hard metrics.I want to make sure that everyone is clear this benchmark model is not a prediction. It will get more accurate as time goes along and already has scored some major victories but using the benchmark itself as a prediction misses the point of the model. Polling is not yet adequate enough to get reliable countybycounty predictions that will be accurate to any degree as much as the state polls are. That being said the demographics can be extrapolated and the counties and precincts can be modeled. What this does is try to say how a candidate is EXPECTED to do given the demographics crosstabs and previous results this year as well as past contests. If a candidate consistently is beating their baselines you can bet they will beat their model baseline as well.I would like to give a special shoutout to the Race Dot Map peopleImage Copyright  Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Dustin A. Cable creator.You can read our Wisconsin Benchmarks at our siteWe have the state benchmarked at Sanders   Clinton .This is above polls but you may know that Sanders has outperformed our benchmarks in several states lately and so the model has reacted to that. This MAY be because these states were caucuses so Clinton may have more room to outperform her Benchmarks than Sanders does.

And  in federal income tax and another  in Vermont income tax.Thats kinda low  a  effective rate. For someone who wants to raise taxes on high income people like himself hes not paying much tax. He needs to release the full return so people can work out how he got his tax so low.Hillary has released her full returns from  onwards. All the Republican candidates have released their full returns apart from Trump who has the excuse that hes being audited for the last five years and doesnt want to release the returns till he knows the IRS agrees with them and they are the final figures.

7160063,0,t3_4dkwgi,Here is what is going to happen now. We are going to endure another stretch of gloating and brigading to intensify after Sanders inevitably wins and wins big in Wyoming. That will trigger another wave of fear among Clinton supporters and confidence among Sanders supporters because human beings just cant help but extrapolate based on recent events. Then New York will vote. Clinton will win. Suddenly everyone will remember that the last few weeks went down exactly like expected since Super Tuesday and that no development has ever shaken the longterm projection of a Clinton nomination. The April th states will vote again with a strong showing for Clinton. Sanders will win some states and Clinton will win some states. Each time the narrative will shift but the math wont. Remember that Clinton is a topnotch candidate with a topnotch team. Remember that a lot of brilliant capable people are paying close attention to this race with a lot more information and resources than we have and they have consistently shown good judgment in responding to the conditions of the primary.  Remember that you are an important part of this process but that you dont have to carry the contest on your own. Try to take a step back from the electoral roller coaster and do what you can to support your candidate  volunteer donate phonebank have conversations with friends and family vote.Take joy and comfort in what you do to support this historic campaign and let experts worry about the details of strategy. I promise we are all going to come out of this smiling and we will need our energy for bigger battles ahead.  ,hillaryclinton,d1s1308,5,t5_2u1c9

Final point given the Republicans plenty of ammo...Get ready for attack adds against our Presidential nominee especially if it is Clinton and all Democratic candidates up for election this fall sponsored by the Koch bros with Bernies smiling face decrying how they are not qualified for their offices probably followed by a snarky text like and this is what their own Presidential candidate said.

I think the rest of the campaign is just pushing as hard as they can to keep the negativity flowing. They dont want to back down. And if it werent for the fact that theyre now starring in the GOP propaganda well see this fall Id say let em. This is a terrible look for Bernie. His extremist supporters desperately want everyone to believe they represent his base and that base is a yuuuge part of the party. But its bull. Most of sanders supporters are far more moderate like Clinton and plan to vote for her and are using this primary as a way to show the party the issues that speak to them. This shitshow is gonna push them away.  In fact its already started.  ,hillaryclinton,d1u8ie0,9,t5_2u1c9
7179624,1,t1_d1u7vne,From the article exit polls said  of Sanders supporters and  from Clintons side straight out didnt vote in that race. About the same actively voted against Kloppenberg from both Sanders and Clinton supporters. Also both Sanders and Clinton had urged voters to cast a ballot for Kloppenberg in that election. And the the thing that I think did the most harm gt The candidates names were listed without a letter indicating party affiliation next to them since the election was officially nonpartisan. In that case a lot of people might have just punched a name without knowing anything about the candidates.My guess as to what happened is Sanders camp is made of Sanders supporters who are not normally politically active so they were busy just making sure he got his voters to turn out to win. Clintons resources are the existing Democratic structure in Wisconsin so they were more plugged in and able to get in info on other candidates while also promoting Clinton.Ultimately  in  Sanders voters voted for Kloppenberg versus  in  out the Clinton supporters meaning the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters did vote for Kloppenberg and Sanders supporters choose to not vote by only a slightly larger margin than Clinton supporters.So come on blaming that loss on Sanders alone is more than unfair.,hillaryclinton,d1u9bvg,2,t5_2u1c9

Clinton said she thought Sanders hadnt done his homework and that does raise a lot of questions.As the topic in question to which Sanders was not prepared was debunked already it was in the very least not honest from Hillarys side.

At the moment is looks like Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic partys nominee and that Donald Trump may well be the Republican partys choice. There will not doubt be other candidates in the general election like the Libertarian partys Gary Johnson.The current topic is whether New York should allow its primary elections be opened up to independent voters or whether the Democratic and Republican primary elections should be reserved for members of the respective parties.

7228618,0,t1_d1ztr1k,We wavered between Two and Three Pinocchios. Clinton has carefully crafted its talking point to find the particular government data that support her point which gives a wildly different view than how trafficking flows are tracked. We do not find the per capita measure as a fair assessment of gun flows from Vermont into New York. The difference between this point using per capita calculation and the raw number  percent of crime guns with source states identified in  came from Vermont is so stark that it creates a significantly misleading impression to the public.

7244581,0,t1_d21m8xa,gt Reducing Americas problem with race to a spreadsheet is deeply offputting to minorities in America especially to black people.My point is that youre attacking a straw man. No one is saying that its a simple equation and that a spreadsheet or bullet list of items is going to suffice. The debate is over whether focusing on classism as a primary target not the sole target but a primary target in the fight against racism is sensical. Its hard to argue otherwise.On the flip side you could also easily argue that white neoliberals like the Clintons tend to overfocus on feelgood PR pandering visiting churches etc than they do on actually agressively attacking the mechanisms that actually create and sustain racism. And thats not to say PR isnt hugely important it is but its also not the only part of the equation.,hillaryclinton,d21nni2,-4,t5_2u1c9

Youre attempting to weasel out now by changing the subject. Stay on topic the gender pay gap. If your response doesnt refute his points it will mean you are unable and so youre just trying to promote your belief without any real evidence.gtgtbut just want to push your own belief when all the evidence points to the opposite.gtThis evidence doesnt exist.The evidence for the gap doesnt exist. And where it does exist its been disproven.gtgtThe article literally states discrimination as its rd point. gtThe articles rd point says Myth  Gender pay discrimination is already illegal and therefore not a problem.. It does not say Myth  Gender pay discrimination is the driving forge in the pay gap. Direct discrimination is incredibly hard to study but it has proven to exist. See this experimental study by NBER gtNo one said that discrimination is the cause of the pay gap but it definitely is a problem that does perpetuate it. Lol. Thats the thing. The article stated no other cause. There may be other causes but they werent mentioned. Hence the article being shitty.

7273118,0,t1_d24w035,Clinton When we think about what more needs to be done we need to be paying attention to the title because it really is the secret opening more doors for women and turning more women into entrepreneurs. In  more than  million women around the world started and managed new business ventures. Nearly  million more women  were running established businesses. But in addition to being optimistic we have to be aware of the fact that in developing countries there are too many disappointments for women because they are underserved by financial institutions. The World Bank has calculated a global credit gap for women of around  billion. This credit gap is one of the biggest problems we face in the global economy.  I have to tell you women are a really good risk to lend to. We need to close this gap. So Im putting my banking friends on notice that this is a big market and someone is going to serve it. This spring Goldman Sachs and the World Bank joined forces to create the first ever global finance facility dedicated exclusively to womenowned small and medium sized enterprises in emerging economies. Its a  million dollar partnership aimed at helping  women access the capital they need to continue growing. Im looking forward to seeing this effort bare fruit. Thanks for shining a bright spotlight on what is possible if you believe in and provide support to women who are ready to go out there and roll up their sleeves and make a difference for their families and their communities.  ,hillaryclinton,d24wkzm,3,t5_2u1c9

7282144,0,t1_d25tp08,I may have preempted a sass call but the oh really is normally a snarky comment.I do not have data for the questions I created but was using some common sense. How you ask questions is more important than what the answers to the questions are was my point.As for the disconnect there is a disconnect between the claimed cost that vox uses and the cost that would happen. For instance it mentions that the tax for employers will be passed to the employee. But it doesnt mention that the liability of that company for that employee would decrease by a larger margin.On mobile right now so excuse the lack of hard calculated data. But if taxes for the employer go up k and that now gives the employee health coverage that the employer was previously paying k for. The net responsibility is down k. Likewise if you assume expense auto get passed to the employee the benefits would expect that their pay would actually increase.This also doesnt calculate how employers will need to find more ways to be competitive for talent. If healthcare isnt a defining characteristic of the benefits then what else will they offer?As an aside there is an assumption that we will reign in the costs of healthcare as well. As of right now we have the most expensive health care yet not everyone has access to it. We are paying more and getting less which the hope is socializing a need will save the outrageously rising costs.Edit here is my post doing the calculation Essentially the estimated cost was k for health insurance for a family plan. The new tax would be little less than k. There is a k less the employer is paying for the employee to have insurance. Then we go into the assumptions that costs are past to the employee then the opposite assumption should be made.,hillaryclinton,d25xjl1,2,t5_2u1c9

If you honestly cant acknowledge that fact were going to have a hard time moving forward.I have not claimed that everyone will dismiss the Republicans attacks as right wing propaganda. What Im saying is that the attacks have ALREADY been made and Hillarys current poll numbers reflect the effects of those attacksand shes still beating Cruz and Trump in the admittedly worthless general election polls. Bernies numbers reflect his national standings before anyone has actually turned their wrath upon him because no one actually thinks hell be the nominee.

7299559,0,t1_d27wajv,I think youre trying to lump too much into what I said. I asked that the But Id vote for Warren trope be dropped. Period. The end. Because it is insensitive. I explained that. I actually would rather you just say you dont like HRC or like her less and why preferably giving policy reasons. I might disagree with you on how we interpret a vote or priority of a position but at least you would appear to be looking at the candidate and issues not looking to shield yourself from criticism. I didnt say I think electing a female president is the most important issue. But I will say I think it is incredibly important.  Women are half our brain power in the US and we treat them like they are expendable.  Sure an incompetent female president wouldnt help that. But I think most people even if they disagree with HRC on issues recognize she is more than competent and experienced.  So I dont see that being an issue.  So having the example that a female can lead the US would make a difference here in how women are perceived potentially having long term benefits both on a personal level of women being and feeling valued and also economically  as businesses that have women in higher level positions tend to be more profitable than those that dont. I dont expect this to happen immediately. This is something that takes time.I also think that having an example to other countries that we value women will elevate our status in the eyes of more progressive countries and also will challenge the less progressive countries to start looking at women differently. We are increasingly seeing policies aimed at limiting reproductive choices.  Sanders has a good voting record but has dismissed it as unimportant. The most important issue to me as a woman in my daily life is controlling my reproduction. It is absolutely part of my autonomy as a human.I think being a white woman is an interesting position I am a white woman because I have the experience of white privilege but not of gender privilege.  And I think that makes me more empathetic to recognizing where privilege is changing access in all sorts of ways. Take the Sierra Blanca vote by Sanders. I think that vote comes from a position of privilege.  I dont think he would make the same vote if he was a not white or not male or not hetero. I really dont. Maybe he would have. But given his other espoused ideals I think he would have seen how wrong the vote was.I think getting to where she has gotten with the lets face it handicap of gender speaks volumes about what HRC can do what her capabilities are and also how tough as nails she is.  Sanders hasnt had those obstacles. If he had I dont think hed be where he is. And being president is about overcoming obstacles.So those are reasons off the top of my head why gender matters. ,hillaryclinton,d27ws1d,1,t5_2u1c9

7314812,0,t1_d29kjoz,I was reading about California you can find super detailed information on it if you do a quick google search. Im sure theres a lot of history you can read. Personally I support closed party primaries because I think you should have a say in your party and yours alone. A partys candidate choice is not a democracy everyone doesnt need to participate youre only choosing a candidate to run for a big election. This person represents MY best interests the party that I am part of. Why should an outsider to that party have a say in who runs to represent MY interests. If independents support anyone thats great but theyre not in the party and they chose not to be. Choosing a party candidate is not about getting the most voters out choosing a party candidate is about getting YOUR voters out to vote. Independents are note democrats nor are they republicans theyre not being supressed theyre CHOOSING not to participate in a party. They should know what the risks are in choosing not to associate with anyone and if they dont then they should accept the consequences of being uninformed. In a general election I think everyone should be able to vote for the candidate they want regardless of party affliation but I believe that is already the case.

He can be a hack since he doesnt depend on future business as a campaign adviser. That means theres no reason for Weaver to turn down the volume on the Hillary attacks. After Tuesday if the polling turns out to be correct there will be no functional path to the democratic nomination for Bernie Sanders. He will be all but guaranteed to lose the pledged delegate race. He will be substantially behind Clinton in the popular vote. In this situation continuing to campaign against Clinton will serve no purpose.

7365626,0,t1_d2fces7,Ok. I appreciate the response. I could write pages on the PLCAA and simply dont want to for sake of my own time and sanity. Here are a few things that arent necessarily structured to respond to your points in logical orderIf the problem is death by a thousand cuts I am not accepting that as a problem but if it is then the most narrowly targeted way of addressing that issue is to have a cost shifting statute whereby plaintiffs are generally responsible for the costs of losing litigation against gun industry players I think we make a mistake talkinga bout manufacturers alone when we talk about the PLCAA because it also applies to dealers  and I think that is potentially a more harmful restriction.While there are exceptions to the PLCAA notably for manufacturing defects even those have been narrowly construed.  A case in the th circuit didnt allow a lawsuit to proceed where a child had shut another child with a gun because the shooting was a volitional act. Now not knowing the facts I dont know if the plaintiffs could show that the gun was defective...but lets say that the facts showed the dealer told the parents it was a good gun to have in the house with children bc it would be difficult for a child to hold...well they never have a chance to get that far and argue that it was defective based on the selling of the gun.There is an interesting case going on now involving a situation where parents warned a gun shop not to sell a gun to their mentally ill dangerous and violent daughter. The gun shop sold the gun anyway she killed her father with the gun. Gun shop was sued and case was dismissed under the PLCAA.  It has been appealed and a portion of it is being allowed to proceed. I havent read the court papers but I hope we can agree that a gun shop that is warned not to sell a gun to a violent and mentally ill person and does so anyway without caring about the warning is doing something that is pretty bad.In Chicago  gun shops supply a disproportionate  of guns used in crimes. Why? No way of really knowing and lawsuits against the gun shops would be dismissed so no way of looking into it.  In Nevada a gun shop that had a mountain of evidence that a large inventory of its guns just went missing had a gun taken by a drifter who left money and used the gun to kill someone. No way of knowing what exactly the evidence would have shown but if the gun shop was skirting gun laws by winking and nodding at people who couldnt pass background checks that guns could just be taken and if money was left it wouldnt bring charges wouldnt that be something the gun shop should be liable for? Im not sure where I read this but as I understand it gun manufacturers have been aware that certain gun shops do lose too much inventory and they take advantage of that by making sure those gun shops have plenty of inventory to loseIn the US in general we pass along a lot of information regulation of industries to individuals because our court system is easy to access.  What this means is that a lot of things we now know manufactuers have done such as market cigarettes intentionally to children we only know due to discovery in litigation.  Discovery does two things  it uncovers the bad actors and it is also a reminder to manufacturers etc that someone is watching.  Right now in the gun industry no one is watching unless youre extremely extremely unlucky and they know that.  How is it that  dealers supply a disproportionate  of guns used in Chicago crimes? How is it that manufacturers who are supplying those dealers dont pay attention to that? are they taking advantage of that probably or are they concerned? The guns used in the Paris attack are linked to a South Florida dealer  the same dealer who was linked to the s IranContra guns and there are reports that the dealer uses unauthorized brokers.  But can it be sued? It would be very very very hard. Your fears about litigation shutting down reddit are the very reason why tort law and contract law actually work.  Reddit isnt going to be shut down.  It hasnt been. It wont be.  The law is actually very good at making sure that crazy lawsuits based on fear not facts dont ultimately withstand scrutiny. Most lawsuits that you hear about that seem to crazy to be true have facts behind them that if you learn them you realize arent so crazy.  No other industry has this level of protection. That is because it is not needed.  To bring a lawsuit under a tort theory you have to show a duty that the defendant negligently recklessly or intentionally failed to uphold that duty and damages.  Showing the duty when it is just a routine you sold a gun the gun was used as intended and it killed someone without more facts is nearly impossible. Most of those cases would be dismissed either on the face of the complaint or more likely after discovery and before trial.  A cost shifting statute which I wouldnt agree with but could stomach would mean that if it was dismissed at one of those stages absent extenuating facts the plaintiffs would pay the costs and fees incurred by the defendant.  But it would still allow access to courts and discovery.  For the few cases that make it to trial the judge would have determined that there is a theory where the defendant did owe a duty...doesnt mean it did but under the facts most favorably construed there is one.  But if the judge hears the evidence and is like no way. They didnt prove it. she can dismiss on a directed verdict or dismiss postverdict on a motion JNOV its a motion to set aside the verdict.  And if that judge is terrible lets pretend she is there is one appeal as of right in all jurisdictions.  And a gun case  that is decided controversially is more likely to get a secondary look after that appeal.  So there are plenty of protections and the only issue here is cost.  And that can be dealt with.  So there is no need for these types of sweeping immunity.  It only protects those who are doing shady things.  It doesnt ultimately protect the dealers who take their responsibilities seriously and the manufacturers who dont want to deal with shady dealers.  ,hillaryclinton,d2ff5u8,1,t5_2u1c9

Thinking of female VP. Someone qualified and someone who could step into role on Day . . Thinking of getting an old hand as VP like Cheney and Biden rather than a younger person. Someone who focuses on the VP role rather than with an eye as next President. Doesnt want an Al Gore VP scenario. I think she had a problem with Al Gore. ,hillaryclinton,d2fmcny,16,t5_2u1c9

Hillary winning will mean I get to see the first woman POTUS in history right after I saw the first black POTUS and it also happens to mean that far and away the most qualified candidate took the reins in driving America back toward its rightful path.gt Its not about hillary losing its about bernie winning.shes not hes not. go on.gt  i view her as just as obfuscated vague and pandering as any other candidate ive seen in my life she represents the same bullshit.because the internet told you to? you never followed politics before which means you never paid attention to anything about HRC before any of this  and only because you keep bringing up this longstanding exhaustion you have with a process youve never participated in... how old are you? gt one thing i have never been happy about is the money in politicsyou must hate that Sanders is wringing his remaining supporters many of whom claim to be bordering on poverty already for money to put toward a campaign that cannot win. gt she definitely takes part in the practice i fundamentally disapprove of.as does Sanders who has several PACs backing him as well as the DNC funding him now and the decades theyve funded and ensured his runs for office in VT were successful. gt not to mention that the checks shes cashing are from people who...well in my eyes theyre monsters. fair enough. kinda badass shes taking their money and then turning around and speaking against them on a national stage huh? Sanders is taking money from the NRA and letting the GOP run campaign ads for him which I find pretty sick. Id still vote for him if he were winning the primaries and he were the choice against Trump.gt her pathetic dodges to releasing those speeches speaks volumes to me i dont think i could ever trust her.well dunno what to say other than congratulations you bought the GOP spin. she should release her intellectual property  pieces used in a business transaction as a private citizen  because you people demand it? that sounds SUPER regressive I thought you guys were super into privacy law and TPP and all that.interesting though that the speeches are being harped on so much so that Jane Sanders has decided to hold his tax returns  you know those things all presidential candidates actually do release per tradition?  hostage because she knows its a last scrap of hope.thats incredibly dirty  thats some political insider bullshit wouldnt you agree?,hillaryclinton,d2ju6mj,5,t5_2u1c9

If independents want to have a say they can choose to register with a party. Ive never quite understood people who choose to register as independent especially in closed primary states. Theres no burden associated with being a member of a party. You dont have to donate to them or vote for them in the general. Literally the only thing that happens when you register as a Democrat is that you get to vote in the party primary.As for the public funding argument people literally make a choice not to be able to access the event when they decline to register for a party. ,hillaryclinton,d2kpi2d,11,t5_2u1c9

He is not a stupid guy and hes been in politics for over  years...he has to realise the truth. Theres no way he believes that super delegates are going to change their minds because of these meaningless polls?! Its just another blatant lie to make his supporters keep believing.

Im jazzed about her big encyclopedic noggin her ability to see all the pieces on the chessboard geopolitically economically  she sees the US as part of a big picture and her genuine drive to understand and address so many different issues. Her platform includes so many interesting initiatives relating to everything from climate change to substance abuse to Alzheimers in addition to campaign finance Wall Street and the other big stuff.

7531410,0,t1_d2xunhn,As an NC resident Pat McCrory is not crazy. He is a nakedly political coward who for his whole term has tried to play both sides of the fence with our crazy legislature to seem levelheaded. Early on he would sign X controversial spending bill and then do things like veto the legislatures clone of the Indiana religious freedom bill for being too broad or something along those lines. He tries very hard to project a common sense image to seem like a consensus governor while he quietly slashes education spending limits student voting and allows fracking among other things.This time he tried to hop on the political correctness gone too far train and it blew up in his face. It was a bill negotiated quickly and privately like several other controversial bills this term supposedly as a common sense measure and tried to play it off like that not expecting it to get nationwide attention. He backpedaled somewhat with his executive order saying private businesses could do what they wanted but the a lot of the worst parts of the bill are still in there like the inability to sue over discrimination so hes still taking a hit. Even now you see him pushing things like were gonna raise teacher pay to k a year! in an election year lol.Paul LePage refused to attend a MLK Day breakfast telling the NAACP to kiss his butt He told students to go to private or charter schools for a good education and that if they couldnt afford it tough luck Hes said that drug dealers with names like DMoney Smoothie and Shifty come into Maine sell heroin and go back home but not before half the time impregnating a young white girl before they leave Most recently he vetoed increased access to an overdose antidote saying that it only extends lives until the next overdose. He is the craziest governor in this country by a mile.,hillaryclinton,d2ya98p,3,t5_2u1c9

7539808,0,t1_d2z5vsx,gtFirst off I dont think speculation is a fair interpretation of how people are assessing Hillary. You say theres no evidence but thats untrue. There is evidence its circumstantial but there are perfectly valid lines of logic that rely on this type of evidence. This is called abductive reasoning explained here First of all no. Working solely off circumstantial evidence is not a perfectly valid line of thought. Thats why circumstantial evidence is not something you can submit as evidence in a court of law. Circumstantially because youre a redditor I can conclude youre a  year old virgin with no friends. Reality is probably quite different but I dont have the evidence to know so Im not actually drawing that conclusion. Thats what you have going on with hillary none of this complex abductive reasoning crap... you have people who basically saw hillarys name on some list associated with some other name of a person who might be known to be nefarious or at least assumed to be and people thus assume Hillary is nefarious. Its not good reasoning its bullcrap is what it is.Second of all no its not a strawman to say you should vote for Hillary because shes better than Trump. She is better than trump and you only have two options to vote for. Third party you say? Thats called The Spoiler Effect worth looking up if you have time its why Gore lost Florida in  and thus the election. People mistakenly thinking a third party is better to choose if you arent big fans of the two mainstream parties is literally why we had to endure  years of Bush. Voting for a third party is has and always will be a useless exercise in our two party system. And no voting for a third party en masse will not end the two party system.gtand has been a massive enemy to change.I assume you think countries with more than two major parties get more change done than we do? Because that is factually untrue. Multi party democracies encounter just as much deadlock per prevailing cultural sentiments at the time as any other country. Were deadlocked because the country is ideologically polarized not because we have two parties. If we had three or more parties the country would still be split roughly  on gay marriage. If we had three or more parties the nation would still be about  split on the basic role of the government. I could go on and on. This year may mark a point where spoiler third party voters yet again run another election though. ,hillaryclinton,d2z8myj,6,t5_2u1c9

7607236,0,t3_4jhar8,I was enthusiastic at the beginning for Bernie and had the usual dislike for Clinton but after I started following  around the time of the AZ primary I started to realize that he probably wasnt going to win this one. After some research of Clinton I decided I was fine with her and that I honestly didnt care about any of the stupid scandals. My position on certain things like Free Trade also changed.What really started pushing me to be against Sanders however was the allornothing mentality of his base specifically from people I know. Normally reasonable people are willing to throw progressiveness under the bus and vote for trump just because Clinton would only give them maybe  of what they wanted instead of . Hell I told one of my good friends about  and he immediately was suspicious of them when they said they didnt think Sanders had that great of a chance at getting the nomination or even our state. The recent Nevada debacle certainly sealed my disdain for Sanderistas.I think that this election has been a growing up moment for me. Im   by Nov and this is my first rodeo I was eligible to vote the previous one but I didnt really care since I was going through my libertarian phase. It taught me the importance of compromise and pragmatism. Im not willing to throw away this election and help elect a protofascist just because I didnt get everything I want and tbh Im probably getting more of what I want than I realize.So I guess Im with her now.,hillaryclinton,d36wiql,23,t5_2u1c9

I highly doubt you were really limiting your statement to something a weak as there is some overlap between his supporters and gamergaters but the majority are fine its just the radical minority I have an issue with. Thats hardly biting criticism. Its neither precise nor constructive. Has their spamming twitter hashtags influenced the Sanders campaigns platform? What does it even mean that  of his supporters are Gamergaters?The whole point is just to divide everyone into two groups label one the bad group and then keep those two at each others throats. Negative tactics to promote positive change never works which is why SRS and Circlebroke just end up being a boys club for hating on others. They promote no positivism they achieve no progress in the things they hate.Imagine were in the same position were in now with the general public only the president hasnt been able to solve it. People are even more angry theyre more desperate and theyre willing to accept just about anyone so long as they offer the hint of a solution. How do people act towards each other?

7657549,0,t1_d3ch9bq,Dont get me wrong I do think he should have some representation on all of the standing committees. What I found out however is that representation is already guaranteed in terms of the structure of the committees. Basically some PLEOs are nominated by the DNC chair and go through an election process to be seated early on. Then there are more after the primaries are finished which are selected from both sides in direct proportion to the popular vote for each state. What Sanders wants however is basically  on all committees.gtSanders threatened to have his delegates attempt to make changes to the party platform and the convention rules at the July convention if the DNC does not address his grievances.gtIt is my hope we can quickly resolve this in a fair way. If the process is set up to produce an unfair onesided result we are prepared to mobilize our delegates to force as many votes as necessary to amend the platform and rules on the floor of the convention he wrote.In many ways as you say forewarned is forearmed.

Massive wealth inequality exists strongly along racial lines and are a strong component of the cycle of poverty which disproportionately afflicts minority groups.There are a million facets to wealth and income inequality and where B goes wrong is by vilifying wealth and success as immoral rather than treating the issue like a social condition that needs to be addressed.,hillaryclinton,d3juzeb,2,t5_2u1c9

7750400,1,t1_d3n1fjn,Now youre the one spinning the vote. You mentioned that  Democrat Senators voted against it but you failed to mention that  voted for it. In that regard Clinton was with the majority. And the resolution was not specifically about invading Iraq. It was presented as giving the President the authority to use our military as leverage that would encourage negotiations. There was no language in the resolution for invading Iraq. They took Bush at his word when he said he wanted the military option as a threatgtgtThe resolution supported and encouraged diplomatic efforts by PresidentGeorge W. Bushto strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Councilall relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq and obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay evasion and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.Its much more complicated than to say she voted to invade. The blame for the invasion falls squarely on Bush. He was the one lying about everything and he was the one who decided to go full invasion before negotiations were exhausted. If Bush had been honest and told Congress that he was already making plans to invade then most would not have voted for it. You can blame Clinton for believing the President along with a bunch of other Senators including a majority of Democrats. But you cant blame her for invading Iraq. That was the Presidents decision. And we should let him off the hook for it by spreading the blame around. ,hillaryclinton,d3n5vqa,1,t5_2u1c9

Meanwhile like Obama shes poised to become one of the best Presidents in history. Fundamental change terrifies some people.

7812739,0,t1_d3u55ix,Nixon was pretty far to the left.  Just because he was a Republican does not automatically make him a conservative.     He got us out of Vietnam.    He was a keen foreign policy type whose diplomatic efforts strengthened our relationships with both established and emerging world powers.    He implemented the first significant federal affirmative action program.    He dramatically increased spending on federal employee salaries.    He oversaw the first largescale integration of public schools in the South something the crackers where I grew up were none too happy about.    He proposed a guaranteed annual wage aka a negative income tax.    He advocated comprehensive national health insurance single payer for all Americans.    He imposed wage and price controls in times of economic crisis. This wasnt a terribly good idea but it was the furthest thing from a conservative idea. Truth is it was positively socialist.    He indexed Social Security for inflation and created Supplemental Security Income.    He created the Environmental Protection Agency EPA Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.    He promoted the Legacy of Parks program.    He appointed four Supreme Court Justices. Three of them voted with the majority in Roe v. Wade.,hillaryclinton,d3u7st3,3,t5_2u1c9

7821343,0,t1_d3v4zrh,I appreciate the real response and Ill try to respond in kind. gtgt So to me you do not speak for them but rather from your own place from which you find Sanders views more to your liking but very much your own place with your own people.Yes absolutely. I cant stand parties and I only respect people who come to their own conclusions. I dont speak for and honestly dislike the Sanders camp. rsfp is like a zombie apocalypse and IT IS ALL CAPS ALL THE TIME PEOPLE. I just support his candidacy because a he does represent my voice well and b his candidacy has been a good thing for the world.The reasons I sometimes make bombastic statements are twofold.  First I only say what I genuinely believe. I do think HRC will tap Romney for VP. Its her best move and she is both smart and  IMHO  unprincipled. A ClintonRomney ticket would sweep the country possibly winning in all  states. Her base would consider her a genius for pulling this off. If I am right then I hope you will remember this conversation. Second making shocking statements encourages people to take clear positions against you. Since I do think ClintonRomney is likely to happen I want to encourage people to say No Effing Way! as loudly as possible in the hopes that they have a moment of cognitive dissonance when the event occurs. It is those moments that add up and eventually lead people to more radical positions ones that they hopefully have figured out for themselves.As for her being a Republican I agree with Chomsky that there is just one party  the money party  and it has two wings. Its been this way since the earliest civilizations. Liberal and conservative are strategies for maintaining the status quo. So I dont think Clinton is a Republican and I dont think Romney is a Democrat. But while they do employ different strategies and have genuinely different ideals they share a common goal of maintaining the status quo. In this way they are both corporatists.This election has seen the first real threat to corporatism in a long long time  probably since Teddy Roosevelt. Trump and Sanders for all their differences do share a slash and burn attitude to the entrenched power of this country. So it is in the interests of both establishment parties to stop both of them. The best way to stop antiestablishmentarianism so fun to type is to unite the establishment and wait for this to blow over.Regarding Obama its true that I am really disappointed. I thought he was different and that once he got into office he would actually stand up to entrenched power. Instead he caved and largely has just been a placeholder president. Part of the reason I wanted to see Sanders elected was just as a test. If he caved as quickly as Obama then I would know that it doesnt matter who is President  once you get that job there is some kind of leverage employed that nullifies you. I wont go into my problems with his presidency unless you are really interested. Its kind of off topic although I am happy to dump if you want to hear it. I will mention that I dont think things are better now in the spheres of economics warpeace environment freedom or privacy. They might be better than they would have been under McCain or Romney but are still worse than they were eight years ago.Thanks for reading!,hillaryclinton,d3v6nw6,1,t5_2u1c9

7869205,0,t1_d409ar8,I just think its convenient that the state of K education is rarely mentioned by Berners. That a disgusting amount of schools teachers and students in public school districts coast to coast are barely staying afloat. Sure college kids or professors have a right to protest issues on college campuses like budget cuts but when you look at colleges theyre fucking palaces compared to most schools in America. Especially innercity schools attended by primarily children of color and rural schools attended by primarily white children. And not to mention the horrid state of special education here I mean how many universities are in worse conditions than elementary middle and high schools. Like I dont think the costs of textbooks are the big issue when in many schools you have rats running around in broad daylight and kids under the patio cover at lunch recess eating their only meal of the day. I dont know why anyone thinks that resolving student debt should be a bigger priority than cleaning up K and giving disadvantaged kids the boost they need. I feel almost as if student debt is almost a privilege. Like Id rather be stranded living with my parents paying off my debt for the next decade which in reality is my situation now than be stranded on the streets with no parents or at least without ones that care resorting to crime to survive or Godforbid in prison.I know Im obviously preaching to the choir here but thats like my biggest issue and one of the reasons why Im so happy about Hillary. Because shes been fighting for the children in our public schools literally her entire political life. And thats why schoolteachers are pretty much unanimously behind her. Anyways in conclusion student debt is without a doubt a form of classism but its more of a middleclass thing than say being pushed through the schooltoprison pipeline. It just bugs the hell out of me that Sandroids think that somehow Hillary is seeking to hurt poor people. When like shes more of an advocate for helping the disadvantaged. And her huge support from PoC and the most financially destitute is a testimony to that. Even Bernie himself frames his campaign as one primarily for the middle class. But his fans see his underdog tone and think that theyre the most disadvantaged ones despite usually being white young and middleclass. rantBut yes student debt needs absolutely needs to be minimized. ,hillaryclinton,d40kl20,3,t5_2u1c9

When I got positions of power at work customers and my male bosses would denigate and shame me. Ive done pretty well considering how many men have tried to shove me down but I am not nearly as strong as Clinton. She is a superhero to me. Her success here is a success to all people who were pushed down by dominant members of society and the discrimination will continue some actions more subtle than others but if we keep strong and know our value we can keep making strides. We are all human and deserve to be treated as such. ,hillaryclinton,d41775p,22,t5_2u1c9
7875209,0,t3_4n5nti,Hi and welcome!  Let me start by saying Ive been a fan of HRC since she announced her run for the senate in . I think she is a dedicated public servant who has dedicated her adult life to working for people in the shadows of society like Hubert Humphrey once spoke about. Her work for children and mothers and minorities is laudable and her persistence when advocating for them is always consistent.  As for the issues you talk about I am only going to go off of how I understand her positions. For more specifics you would need to watch speeches read transcripts and browse her issues portal. Anyhow heres my take  Environmental policy I know a lot has been made about her past statements and work regarding fracking. Lets start with the idea that fracking when regulated properly can be a net gain for the economy. The horror stories we hear are from irresponsible companies who are taking advantage of the lack of regulation. Additionally HRC is very much aware of the threat that global warming presents to all of us and I respect her leadership in that field. As for nuclear power Im not aware of her stance on the issue but I am not personally against the idea because nuclear is clean.  Education When it comes to education you need only look at the work shes done for prek and you can immediately extrapolate how important education is to HRC. Even in her book It Takes a Village she speaks about the importance of education not only early in life but throughout. When it comes to postsecondary I think that we all as a party and a country need to take a long hard look at how the rest of the developed world does things. The US has without question the best colleges and universities in the world. Making them more accessible to Americans who are smart enough to go is a great thing. This is one issue I am happy that Bernie may have moved her left on though I doubt HRC and Bernie are really all that far apart. Generally though I would like to see HRC talk more about her ideas about education. Not just college and postsecondary but what are we going to do with common core and how are we going to regain our international dominance in the STEM disciplines.  Finally what I am looking for in a Hillary presidency is first a continuation of the good work that Obama has started but also the efforts that HRC will put in to getting more democrats elected as well. Hillary being an insider is a net positive to me and I think it will help move this stagnant congress forward. However unpopular HRC seems her and Bill are really good at getting policy moved through. I know that incrementalism may be boring and not provide the fireworks we would all like to see but thats how things really truly work in a democratic republic.  Something else that excites me is that we will finally have a president who isnt afraid to get dirty and in to the weeds when it comes to her policy proposals and defending them. Not that president Obama hasnt but she will do it differently. I can think of no politician with as high a profile as HRC who is able to provide a message and stay disciplined with it to prove the benefits of her proposals.  I am also excited to have HRC get to work on expanding Obamacare. I wasnt very happy in the beginning about how much of Obamacare was a windfall to the private insurance industry not in the slightest. However I realize this is progress in the right direction. I think HRC will work on a public option which will lay the groundwork for what I hope to be the final step in all of this which is universal medicare.,hillaryclinton,d418v91,1,t5_2u1c9

Wants all votes in California voted edit counted thinks it will be closer but not enough to matter.

The red meat stuff was required for them to win the Republican nomination but it was easy to see it wasnt really who they were McCain had always heretofore been labeled the maverick of his party and Romney initiated the blueprint for Obamacare in MA Romneycare.Much respect to Mitt for having a spine and the balls to call out what he sees as wrong. Theres not a ton for him to lose but theres not a ton for him to gain either. I think hes just doing this because he cares and is appalled by what he sees.

Its a lot easier to kill yourself with a gun and easy quick access to guns has a known effect on the suicide rate.Research published in the American Journal of Public Health showed that states with a law in place that required a waiting period for the completion of handgun sales had  fewer suicides per capita and  fewer firearm suicides.

From here on out starting next week the Economist polls will NOT be included in the approval indices for they are very clearly antiObama.This isnt okay.

I dont think shed turn off too many Republicans who were considering voting for Hillary because a VP doesnt actually have that much power and getting her out of the Senate could be seen as a win for them.

8146659,0,t1_d4vrqv1, The links above are my references Here are her  biggest spending focuses that stand out in my eyes.  Reinvesting in Infrastructure and Scientific Research DebtFree Tuition for college students Programs to fight Drug Addiction  Ensuring Paid Family Leave for LowIncome families and particularly for women. This last one is not as many people portray it a handout to the poor but an attempt to boost the Labor Force Participation Rate for women since many times they cant keep their jobs because theyre occupied by child care. But your probably more interested like me on how we pay for all this and fight income inequality She wants to grant  percent tax credit for companies that share profits with workers on top of wages and pay increases.  She proposed a new  percent minimum effective tax rate on adjusted gross income AGI above  million. She also proposed a  percent surcharge on AGI above  million to create a new marginal income tax rate of . percent.  Her plan would impose a  percent limit on the tax value of deductions income exclusions and other loopholes that are highly popular with wealthier families and individuals The Clinton plan would eliminate the carried interest provisions that has allowed hedge funds and private equity accounts to pay a tax rate on their profits far below the rate that most Americans pay on ordinary income.

Not just to Hillary but to those further right than her which encompasses a big percentage of America.  Their world views are equally valid to Bernies.  His view isnt the best just because some people agree with him. There is no ONE way for the world to be or change. The trick is to find a policy that stretches while it supports. I think this platform does that.For example gay marriage in NY was largely unpopular when Hillary became its senator...so it wasnt the right time to push for it.  She works hard at shifting POV along with grassroots organizations and several ears later it was more palatable to a larger percentage of the population.  We now have gay marriage.  Same deal with most other issues including he minimum wage had she been as purist and radical has Bernie demands none of this would have happened. You cant force feed your ideals down someone elses throat.  Thats called fascism.To block an advance because something doesnt match your vision even though it stretches a larger proportion of people isnt how you get things done.  this is progressive for most of America as it stands NOW.  next time it will be made more progressive for the world as it is THEN.,hillaryclinton,d4wmb2m,4,t5_2u1c9

8159255,0,t1_d4xdr3y,First no Senators that give up a seat with a Republican governor is happening. Dark horse is the former governor of Washington Gary Locke. Second Tim Kaine represents Virginia. If Tim Kaine represented Massachusetts he would be as liberal as Warren and vice versa or her or should would not be elected in Virginia. I am sorry but I am going to have to slam you as it is clear that you dont know anything about Virginia politics or Tim Kaine. Not sure where you are from but you are not from the DC area or follow the politics of the area. I dont know jack about Brown I did live  years in Mass but I know more about Virginia politics than any other state.Tim Kaine left office as the second most popular governor in the history of Virginia. Most likely he was Obamas second choice for VP to Joe Biden. Joe Biden has worked out quite well and he brought many issues to the table that Tim Kaine would never bring. In January  Kaine became the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. He took the position at the request of President Obama.I have met Tim Kaine in person. I dont usually say this about politicians and I have met many but he is one of the sweetest nicest genuine men that I have met. There is none of that Sanders gruffness to be found in this man. He can work with Mrs. Clinton. He would also diminish the lefts charges of her being a warhawk. As far as him being a moderate as i said that is in Virginia. This man is a Catholic in its truest sense. Think Pope Francis style. Hell be right on board with expansions of health care education etc. and he is anti death penalty. He also has a  rating from Planned Parenthood so no issues there.As governor of Virginia he was tremendous at growing business including small businesses in Virginia. One of the reasons Virginia is now considered the  wine state east of the Mississippi is because of his efforts. Unlike California you dont hear about outbreaks of various childhood diseases like measles and mumps because Virginia makes school children get vaccines unless you can demonstrate hardcore religous exception. Thank Tim Kaine. Virginia has one of he best HPV vaccinations rates in the country. Thank Tim Kaine. And Tim Kaine led Virginia during the Virginia Tech mass shooting. In a progun state he actually got laws changed to limit access to guns with people who have a history of psychological issues.Finally Tim Kaine has been a Senator for less than  yeas but has not been a silent freshman especially when it comes to war and peace in the Middle East challenging both Democrats and Republicans to do their Congressional duty and pass the laws required for intervention in the Middle East for how long and against whom. Of course this has not happened. There are other reasons that Virginia is important. With Trump handing us Florida with his Star of David Mrs. Clinton needs to only win the swing states of Virginia and Nevada to win the election. Senator Kaine also speaks fluent Spanish.Due to court ordered redistricting Virginia should be gaining  possibly  Democratic members of the House in  election. After the  census the gains will be even larger because of Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area. Trump and his gutting of the government does not play well in Virginia. Because Virginia was a slam dunk for Mrs. Clinton in the primary it is estimated that anywhere between  to K of her voters voted for Mark Rubio in the Republican primary to stop Trump especially in Northern Virginia as Virginia has a semiopen primary. Finally Northern Virginia brings the intangibles of having the   and  highestincome counties in the United States which get bluer and bluer every year.Hope my rant didnt bore anyone too much.The Progressive Case For Tim Kaine As VP,hillaryclinton,d4xge8a,7,t5_2u1c9

8177195,0,t1_d4zia9z,Ill take a crack with my take.To start off I imagine this is more of a benchmark for Hillary than a guarantee.  I doubt she would axe a highly qualified male or female to ensure an exact gender split. In addition Im not necessarily against it I just have my qualms. However Ill make my argument questioning it Pure probability makes it unlikely that it would end up exactly  on either side.  Its just unlikely that an unbiased genderblind cabinet would end up even the same way if you flipped a coin  times it would unlikely end up exactly . More important are the arguments for or against quotas.  First the arguments seem to hinge on the presumption that we all suffer from unconscious bias  this isnt true.  Studies certainly show biased tendencies across society but they dont say much about individuals. Basically you could send out a survey and find out that Americans were overweight but it would have little bearing on huge swaths of America. Considering the fact that people test out as having less and more bias and that can be worked with this clearly isnt a certainty.  Second it assumes that bias ALWAYS favors white males  which is particularly relevant considering that the person presumably hiring in this case is female.  Yes historically it has tended to and again on average probably still tends to.  If youre looking for a sort of historical reckoning of the past then theres certainly a case.  But if youre looking at now and individuals its not certain again especially since the person in charge is a female who knows her stuff. It  presumes that youre simply looking for any qualified candidate when even if its an imperfect search I would hope that youre looking for the best one.  I believe in affirmative action for schools and to a lesser extent in certain jobs but the further up the chain you get the more qualms I have with it.  There really arent thousands of people qualified to be Secretary of State or the Federal Reserve Chairman or many other positions. There are probably closer to  maybe . Regardless Id like to think that whoever was chosen was at least believed by the person hiring to be the best one to do the job.   I voted for Clinton in the Primary and Im voting for her in the general because I think shes the best qualified candidate. Ive counted the last several votes Ive made in state and Presidential elections and its been  votes for black men  votes for white women and  vote for a white man who was a Republican when I generally vote Democrat.  I voted for all of them because I thought they were best qualified. I would not have voted for any of them simply because of race or gender.  Considering that most people seem to agree this s hould be the case the idea that women should vote for Hillary because shes a woman was not received well the question becomes at what point in the chain should people disregard these factors.  In my opinion the higher up the chain the more important the job the more I want the person hiring to be picking the person they think is best.  Cabinet might be up there for me.  The examples given the Rooney Rule in the NFL and symphonies were of people being given equal opportunity rather than guaranteeing a certain number of jobs.  Admittedly in this case Hillary isnt going to put on blindfolds to interview cabinet members but I dont see much reason why something like the Rooney Rule where there was some sort of guarantee of putting a certain number of women up for consideration wouldnt suffice. Or that you wouldnt be able to trust her to hire similarly qualified women over men.  Personally I dont particularly care what the cabinet ends up splitwise so long as no ones being discriminated against.  But I do like to think that the person in charge who I voted for to make these decisions believes that theyre the best people for the job.Again Im not necessarily against it but I do think that there are issues with it.,hillaryclinton,d4zp6is,1,t5_2u1c9

Theres a lot of help for them but money isnt really the problem it kids not finishing because they didnt know what they wanted when they started. There is also too many people going to colleges instead of trade schools. I support Obama in his efforts to reign in the private college racket. I agree that programs to help are important but the bill needs to be paid by the students or parents as a matter of fairness.

He was a genocidal maniac slaughtering the Kurds and was using iron fist techniques to maintain order against the majority population. I said that we have two choices  continue with these fictitious states and accept genocidal war lords as being needed to keep a reign on them or accept some instability and work toward building a middle east that is more composed of ethnic and religious boundaries.I said that there is no Iraqi people. There are Kurds who are better off but at the expensive of nearly  decades of war. There are Sunni who were immediately victims of genocidal violence in response to anti baathism in the aftermath of our withdrawal and now all Sunni territory is being occupied and fought over by ISIS. There are Shia who now have to fight fucking ISIS and have to run a government of a country comprised of two other major groups who dont want any part of it.I said the Iraqi people are not better off because there is no Iraqi people. But bar the Kurds the people of Iraq are suffering far more now than they ever did before. And thats a fact.

Assuming parents can be in two places at once or that work demands are somehow optional is whats insulting and inaccurate.Parents need legislative reforms to afford them more leeway when family life demands it.  They need shorter working hours and flexible schedules.  They need higher incomes so they can afford to provide for children beyond the barest of necessities.One reason why I like Hillary is because she advocates for these familyfocused reforms.

8368569,0,t1_d5nkz4f,gt And I just really want to point out that he was basically mathematically eliminated back in MarchIm a former Berner and I was active on Sandersforpresident under a different account that is gone now because of my OCD. I knew he wasnt going to win on March st as I walked to the church where our voting area is located and filled in the box for Bernie Sanders which helped deliver my red state for him. It wasnt because the DNC rigged the polls voting is done on the state level state parties andor the secretary of state of the state control the process. I stopped looking at that sub around the same time because of their need to find some kind of magical thinking validation as to why things werent working the way they expected them to other than hey we put up a good fight but it didnt work out. I also left because of the noticeable Trump spam that began to pop up and incessant Hilary Hate which I was never intoHonestly it reminds me of what engineering professor Thomas W. Eagar said about  Truthers he said they use the scientific method backwards as they determine what happened throw out all the data that doesnt fit their conclusion and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion. Im not saying DWS isnt bad as her job or unfit to be the leader of the DNC Ive been saying that since November  when we got steamrolled in the midterms but she isnt the reason Bernie Sanders lost. He never turned out his youth voter base he opted for large rallies rather than retail politics and he never convinced minority voters in most states to vote for him and a lot of these emails show some of the campaigns incompetence and the DNC extending deadlines for them because his campaign staff couldnt get it together.I imagine you wont see Bernie saying he lost because of what is contained in this email dump and most Bernie Sanders voters like myself have already moved on. This could be exploited by the Trump campaign to some affect and most of the BernieOrBust devotees werent going to come over anyway although those on the edge might be more difficult to convince but Im going to wait and see if this turns into a big nothingburger like when the DNCs archives on Trump got released.edit changed a phrase,hillaryclinton,d5nmdyf,14,t5_2u1c9

8371568,0,t1_d5ny1o0,TimMeijer thank you for a thoughtful reply!I both agree and disagree simultaneously.Theoretically philosophically its best to make ones appeal to others in an allinclusive manner.But up til recently historically speaking that allinclusive manner wasnt actually allinclusive.  Women and minorities of all types were not actually included in what was seen as allinclusive.  And while thats changed some it hasnt changed enough.This is a bit like the misunderstanding thats made those who cry all lives matter fail to realize that we who cry black lives matter do so not because we disagree with the allinclusive sentiment  we agree all lives matter  but because all too often our society our government in its agents and its policies  behaves as if black lives do not matter.I know from what youve said that you get this Im trying to point out the parallel.Its too soon to be able to talkbehave in a colorblind genderblind orientationblind manner because we dont live in the theoretically perfect world we aspire to build we live in this one in which too too many people still are blind to the various subtle and nonsubtle forms of discrimination that still disadvantage women minorities and the poor.,hillaryclinton,d5nzv8g,5,t5_2u1c9

And when one person suggested they take an action they were told they couldnt proving that they were actively trying to be impartial. News flash its not against the rules to have opinions its not surprising that the DNC preferred Clinton and rules can only be broken if actual actions were taken.I havent seen any proof in this hand picked selection of emails that anybody actually did anything to influence the primary. Yet Sanders diehards and the media are swallowing it hook line and sinker using wild speculation from earlier in the primaries as a supposed pattern of behavior. Sorry but a few opinions in a few emails out of  cherry picked by Russia to do damage to the Democrats plus a bunch of sore losers bitching about common election anomalies every single time they lost during the primaries doesnt make a pattern of corruption. Just a pattern of stupid people failing to use proper skepticism and rational thought. ,hillaryclinton,d5pfy90,4,t5_2u1c9

However now its time to unify and I believe that America needs to follow the road highlighted in the Democratic Party Platform. It is the best chance to advance Bernies ideals. They may not all be realized less of them may be realized under Hillary compared to Bernie but well keep moving forward. I agree with a lot of whats said here. Dont belittle the BernieOrBusters listen share ideas about how to elect progressives to Congress and other political offices. Show them kindness and respect and theyll come around.EDIT Also especially for the older Clintonites among us dont try to tell them that their idea of a revolution is ignorant and unobtainable.

And all the while the times has given equal weight to these lies as it gives the truth. And every story it writes points somewhere overtly and implied somewhere she has trust issues. Then it writes stories nonstop can she be trusted. Then it asks can she change the perception and now on her big night you have this story. Just another prime example of vague writings about some nebulous trust issue which she only has because of publications like the times writing dutifully about Republican lies. Enough.

They arent academic works where originality of thought and analysis are the way to earn points and to take those is to essentially steal them from elsewhere. Political speeches serve a different purpose and have different standards.In the case of the Melania Trump speech the lifted language took the form of what should have been a deeply personal narrative about upbringing and family values. Lifting someone elses narrative in that circumstance is fundamentally ungenuine and dishonest.In the case of Hillarys speech she was making an observation about the character of a nation.

But Sanders efforts to parlay this vote into indisputable proof of his marriage equality bona fides ring hollow in light of his statements at the time. Explaining his vote in  Sanders chief of staff told the Rutland Herald that Sanders vote was motivated by a concern for states rights not equality. gt Sanders took a similarly cautious approach to samesex marriage. In  he took a stand against samesex marriage in Vermont stating that he instead endorsed civil unions. Sanders told the Associated Press that he was comfortable with civil unions not full marriage equality. To justify his stance Sanders complained that a battle for samesex marriage would be too divisive.gtEarlier in his political career Sanders was even more indifferent toward gay rights which W.J. Conroy recounts in his book Challenging the Boundaries of Reform Socialism in Burlington. When serving as mayor of Burlington Sanders told an interviewer that LGBT rights were not a major priority for him. Asked if he would support a bill to protect gays from job discrimination Sanders responded probably not.You talk about that gay pride parade in  but did you know about the We believe in Marriage week the year before in  where Bernie  as Mayor  signed a resolution supporting traditional marriage between a man and a woman?What about the great work Hillary has done in supporting LBGTQ rights in general especially as Senator and SoS?So you see when things become a who did what first and who is the better supporter of insert issue here old actions are dredged up on both sides it can become a bit too reductionist. It ignores the big strides both parties made over the years and what their stance is now. It also ignores the big strides society has made even in just the past decade when it comes to acknowledging marriage equality specifically and gay rights in a general sense.Edited to add Hillary has marched in the NY Pride Parade three times in   and .

The biggest thing is to practice out loud on your own or ideally with someone else. Practice natural concise responses to common questions work on your breathing and pacing and tone. Smile while youre doing it because no matter how stupid it sounds people can really hear it in your voice and it has a huge impact on whether people on the other end of the phone call will feel comfortable and trusting.

8483586,0,t1_d61papi,Listened to the podcast. As you say weights and other objective measures are used in the model. And I am sure that he is sincere when admits his past mistakes. But at the end of the day he does have to decide whether a model and its parameters are sensible. There is no single best way to determine which model is the best. And there is no true poll for him to compare a models output with. So when he decides which model to use he is partially basing it on which models output are most consistent with his expectations. And his expectations are susceptible to being influenced by his bias.I dont know whether or not his favoritism towards Hillary will influence his numbers at all but either way I do think that him holding such strong opinions against one of the candidates is unscientific.,hillaryclinton,d61zs1s,2,t5_2u1c9

Just today a poll was released showing that the number of republicans who support him went from  to ... hes not losing support where it matters for him hes gaining it. For better or worse  I say for MUCH worse  people dont like Hillary Clinton. They dont trust her. And even though I cannot for the life of me figure out why that is it remains a truth among the American public. Yes Trump may be even less trustedliked but for some reason that is not enough to stop people voting for him. The people who dont trust hillary dont vote for her. But many people who openly admit they dont trust Trump are still planning to vote for him.

Being automatically pro or antiintervention without actually taking into account of the specifics of each situation is very problematic to me.

They should hire more articulate athletes and let them lead in commentary so so difficult for the talking heads who only think they can do sports commentary!.   A friend tipped me off to the replays on the NBC site for swimming which had a couple of very sharp and very fair Aussies doing the talking.  Since you are Dutch I will tell you my NBC TV story from the  winter games.  I follow modern European constitutional monarchies as a distraction from crazy US politics.  My royal watcher friends were very excited during the speed skating when the camera panned to the Dutch king and queen in the stands among the orangewigged crowds .  I saw that when I was watching and just about fell over in shock when they were correctly identified by the NBC host the second time the camera panned.  I thought that NBC had finally acquired A Clue  as a note coverage of notBritish or notdescendedfromGraceKelly royals is not very common here so its not something that a lot of us know.  I later learned that  either NOS or another Dutch group do all the TV work for the speed skating because well they are simply the best at it and everyone else just uses their feed.   So it really wasnt that remarkable that they were paying attention.  One of the Dutch crew must have sent the information up to the booth.   ,hillaryclinton,d6kggsn,1,t5_2u1c9

It was without a doubt something she had to do to maximize the effect of the speech. She is not trying to get them to join her. She is trying to show them that they are not the target of her speech. This is what I said about  days ago regarding this speechgt It will be interesting how she frames it. Unfortunately the most effective path to do it will not be as popular on the Left.gt Basically she should give cover to the real Republicans and play to their notion that this is an aberration. If she drives a epic wedge between AltRight and Real Republicans her message will be echoed by the Right all over OpEd pieces and on TV. Though hanging the AltRight around the neck of the Establishment Republicanshowever true will only serve as red meat for the Left.

8776999,0,t1_d72s8l8,Glad you asked!  The USTR has a helpful explainer of ISDS on their website.  It protects  basic rights Freedom from discrimination  An assurance that Americans doing business abroad will face a level playing field and will not be treated less favorably than local investors or competitors from third countries.  Protection against uncompensated expropriation of property  An assurance that the property of investors will not be seized by the government without the payment of just compensation.  Protection against denial of justice  An assurance that investors will not be denied justice in criminal civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.  Right to transfer capital  An assurance that investors will be able to move capital relating to their investments freely subject to safeguards to provide governments flexibility including to respond to financial crises and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system.So in the example you gave you wouldnt be able to challenge Japans change to their capital gains taxes unless the change only applied to foreign investors.  Then you may be able to argue that the first right was violated.  But a general increase in capital gains taxes wouldnt be discriminatory at all.The whole point of ISDS is to ensure that countries treat investors from signatory companies the same as domestic companies.  This is largely what free trade is in general.,hillaryclinton,d72sk7k,1,t5_2u1c9

She then blurted Donald Trump has said so many controversial things over the last few days that we dont even have time to report any negative things about Hillary Clinton.  My jaw just dropped. To me that sums up the way the MSM especially cable news intend to cover this election. By the way it was the same reporter that covered Hillary Clintons address to the NAACP or some other black organization.  Hillary answered some questions from the press while she was on stage.  The first question from the reporter from MSNBC?  EMAILS!!!  Next question?  Why are you so unliked!  Lol,hillaryclinton,d73odbq,1,t5_2u1c9

His denigration of everything  America in general the military the situation of black people undocumented immigrants etc. etc. his paranoia his conspiracy theories  are where his real feelings start to show.  He should never have the power to express his real feelings upon our nation.  People like Stalin did that with his purges and concentration camps Hitler similarly.  Thats what these dictators do they seize power and then they have an entire country to punish and hurt.  Its not even so much his particular proposals that are so alarming.  Who knows if a Wall would even get built etc. etc.  Who knows what he would actually do if he were President he changes his mind so much anyway.  Its the fact that we would have a dictator personality  as President of a democracy.  We would instantly be in a battle to keep our democracy to stop him from actually becoming a dictator.  ,hillaryclinton,d7i5mi3,0,t5_2u1c9

Trump hasnt lead a single poll in Minnesota Michigan or Wisconsin aside from those statewide tracking polls that give bizarre results in every state and hes put very little effort into contesting them Minnesota nobody is contesting he sometimes visits Michigan and Wisconsin but he stopped running ads in Michigan after a week and Clinton isnt running ads in all three. All three have been solidly blue the past few cycles. Its all fools gold. Plus hes deeply unpopular in Wisconsin even among the right. Colorado and Virginia have moved so far blue Clinton has stopped running ads there. She has a solid lead in the polls there. Thats the most significant Electoral college change this cycle. More so than Trump trying to make plays into Maine and Connecticut more so than Arizona and Georgia turning into battlegrounds or close polls in Kansas and Texas. Colorado and Texas were reliably red states for decades which werent even contested by Kerry. Obama eeked out close wins in Virginia twice and Colorado was thought to be super close in  by the Obama campaign. Theyre not close at all anymore. Thats  electoral votes that Clinton is so confident in shes barely even trying to defend them anymore. With all those she just needs to defend PA shes doing fairly well in the polls there and its their home turf and carry any other state. New Hampshire is easiest where she has a solid lead in the polls a small state that Trump hasnt devoted any effort in really no ads there not many visits Ohio by all accounts a close state and where organization will probably turn out the win  Iowa Trumps best swing state but he still has no organization there nor ads Nevada close swing state but get out the vote matters and polls probably understate Dem support North Carolina doing better there than some other states and where the Trump campaign is lagging behind Clinton and Floridathe big one but she has a massive organizing edge and a slight edge in the polls.

If Clinton is actually ahead a few points we will still see a few polls with Trump leads and a few polls where Clinton is up high single digits.The problem is a lot of people cant deal with these conclusions and start cherry picking data.

8955201,0,t3_52wyyi,As a Democrat I honestly dont think much of this argument.  For example Clintons great economic success latched on to the sudden upturn in the economy at the end of Bushs presidency and the .com boom.  I do believe that a social safety net is a very good thing for the economy but I just dont believe that the party affiliation of who is in the Oval Office over the timescale of  years is the deciding factor in how the economy goes.  Well Reagan screwed up I guess so theres a big smear on the Republican party.  In terms of bad economic decisions I even dont place much blame on Bush Jr.  A lot of the decision making then was what is least bad given we just had a massive terrorist attack in our tier A global city? and can we honestly say a Democrat could have made the economy work in that situation without inviting the financial bubble?  Even Kurgman who was super critical of Greenspans decisions at the time basically admitted he cant think of what else you could have done but lower interest rates given the situation.  I suppose Bill Clinton would argue he was more hawkish than Bush and  would never had happened if he was president for just a few more months but thats a separate issue.  ,hillaryclinton,d7oa4sd,3,t5_2u1c9

Its polite to go there first before posting in a subreddit. Every single subreddit has them. Why should we reward them for not paying attention?gt This also isnt about appeasement  this is about education.If they really wanted to be educated they would ask better questions. And if they really wanted to be educated saying Hey look at the links and read the discussion would be an answer they would be perfectly OK with. You can spend your time trying to educate them hoping that some of them are sincere. But to ask everyone else to do that I disagree. It is a waste of time. Direct them to the links direct them to read the discussions. If they sersiously want to know more thats where the info is. And if they are honest a direction to the links and to read the discussions will make them happy. If they are not honest they will be upset by that and be pissy. Going into a sub that you have never been to before and making a post asking So what is it you all like about this subs content I honestly want to know is not polite its not honest and it is usually someone who isnt willing to take the time to really consider the thing they are asking about.

Im fairly confident that at the end of Hillarys presidency people will also have forgotten about all of the insane conspiracy theories they had about her and look back at Hillary Clintons years and say Eh!

The metro area has more jobs than it did during the height of the Detroit auto industry but now the jobs are mostly in the suburbs and mostly in services rather than factory jobs. Our factories are producing more than ever before but they need fewer workers because industrial robots and other automation has made them much more efficient.There was a lot of white flight to the suburbs starting in the s. The lower population and smaller tax base made it more difficult to pay for city services which made the city less desirable to live in which led to even more people to leave the city and it continued to spiral until they filed bankruptcy. Other former industrial cities like Pittsburgh have done a much better job maintaining a vibrant city based on technology and healthcare.

Im in it and its in me.I do however view the party as irredeemable. The offenses are too great in my estimation.  Congressional republicans have done great harm to our republic our families and our communities...and they are not alone. A tiny example is TX AG Paxton filed suit against the admin in a bid to keep more low wage workers from being eligible for overtime. I protect my biz with ferocity but Paxton is now actively trying to take food from babies mouths in a stunt to deny any progress to the administration. Being paid fairly for work that goes beyond the normal workweek is not something a legitimate business owner or politician will argue. Another slightly larger example? Remember CA energy crisis that led to the removal of Gov Grey Davis? Total republican hoaxa coup. I say the Republican Party deserves a very public execution after thorough public water boarding. Run the offenders out on a rail.Corporatism is the sexyass legit looking drug dealer  and cash is the drug. A greatly modernized evidencebased secular conservatism foil would sweep.

She should continue to find outlets with which to anger him and baitandswitch him into defending himself rather than attacking Clinton.The debate went spectacularly for two reasons one because Clinton was amazing and two because Trump did not capitalise on his opportunities. Trump could have made the middle east the emails and the cybersecurity questions into real and serious attacks on Clinton she needs to prepare for those next debate.Other than that in terms of improvement I think she needs to set the narrative in terms of who is right over the border wall as well as over trade deals.

9189896,0,t1_d8gtm31,I realize that primaries are always going to be tough and that part of campaigning is going to be ugly. For me personally the main issue is sexism on the left. Not only Sanders though he and his surrogates did play in that dirty sandbox a bit but just more generally. The most painful of all womens oppression is coming from our socalled liberal brothers. Its nothing new Im sure it motivated the PUMAs too. It was hard for us to have to wait our turn yet again.With this primary what a lot of feminists like me see I really am just speaking for myself and a lot of women from whom Ive heard the same kinds of things is a woman who has played by all the rules and done a better job by far than any of her relatively mediocre colleagues. We saw Bernie as that guy the one in the office who swoops in and takes all the credit but does fuckall to make things happen. But he talks well and gathers up the glory and we have to smile and nod so he wont stand in the way of us continuing to work hard for the things we want. But anyway the main thing for me is that Hillary spent her entire adult life developing working relationships with colleagues in public service. There is no one credible who has come forward and said shes hard to work with while many people from all walks of life and perspectives have made it their business to remark on how incredibly awesome she is to work with and for. From my perspective she earned all her endorsements through hard work willingness to listen and compromise and negotiate and on and on. All while being belittled and demeaned in subtle and not so subtle sexist ways throughout the years. And instead of recognizing and admiring her accomplishments in that respect or at the very least just whitewashing them Sanders and company reframed that as a rigged system. When they complained about the superdelegates they were fundamentally complaining about the fact that  of their mutual colleagues preferred the idea of working for her rather than Bernie and they ignored any kind of real reason why those colleagues would have had those preferences. Sanders was asking us to just take him ahistorically ignoring what is historically womens work hard work that actually keeps the lights on. Thats what a lot of women like me saw.And going beyond that it was reckless to reframe womens work as a rigged system and now here he is having to undo all that. Im grateful that Jane was able to convince him to do it heh heh and a lot of my negative feelings toward him and his surrogates are fading. But whenever I encounter someone who is still singing that song about rigged systems Im sad and I still kinda blame him.I was out knocking on Democratic voters doors this weekend. Most people were enthusiastic but about  all young men were convinced that their votes wouldnt count in the rigged system so they were either going to do a protest vote or not vote at all. I wanted to go back there like the mom I am and lecture them like I would my own boys until they crumbled in shame but we dont have time for that.Phew anyway go Bernie!,hillaryclinton,d8gvxgw,2,t5_2u1c9

9225414,0,t1_d8lc3cf,It doesnt matter if it was a week ago or  years ago. Donald Trump treats women like chattel. He fat shames he lies he makes shit up at  AM in hopes of embarrassing a woman because she dared to go public with the way he treated her.Add to that the Donald keeps dragging up Bill Clintons indiscretions from a lot longer than  years ago. We dont need guys like Donald Trump setting an example for our young men. We also dont need guys like Bill Clinton setting an example for our young men. Im no raging fan of Hillary Clinton there is no doubt she is done awful things and precipitated some worldwide shit thats going to take a lot of time to recover from if ever. Im not saying go vote for Hillary Im saying make damn sure of who you really are before you cast a vote for a man that thinks its OK to walk up to a woman and grab her by the twat while forcing his tongue down her throat because hes rich and famous.  Would you honestly want him anywhere near your sister or your daughter or your wife if she happened to be hot?  The only person whos come out of this looking vaguely decent is Melina Trump. She refused to go on camera with him and discuss this situation and good on her for doing that. It may be the only stand she ever takes but at least she stood up.  Not even Hillary Clinton put her political aspirations aside when her husband was out screwing everything in a skirt.This is my opinion anyway it doesnt matter to me at all if people agree with me thats the wonderful thing about having a brain and not being afraid to use it. You can form your own opinions make your own decisions based upon experience facts and hopefully a bit of commonsense. Hopefully the latter will prevail.,hillaryclinton,d8le0lo,1,t5_2u1c9

Trying to paint Hillary as a human being in itself seems like a lesson in just how deeply rooted the misogyny in our culture is.  Aside from the fact that Hillary and Obama are both amazing public servants and have done so much to keep this country moving forward they have sparked really great conversations assuming people can stay civil  about race and gender and our own biases. For some of us  its exposing things in our subconscious we didnt know was there.  For others theyll just dig their heels in deeper.

9249828,0,t1_d8ofg7w,there is a reason Trump kicked off his campaign with the line about Mexicans being rapists.  The fear of white men is not of immigrants taking their jobs. What keeps guns under white males beds is the fear of men from other races raping their women.  Lack of empathy for immigrants is partly IMHO because the fear of their women being raped is greater than their perceived need to be empathetic.  How dare you say i should be empathetic when white women are at risk. And we cant let in immigrant children who are at great risk because immigrant men would soon find a loophole and come in as well.  The rape line by Trump should have disqualified him right at the beginning. Trying to play into this insecurity of white males was so blatant.  I do think we need to talk about why Trump got so popular after saying Mexican immigrants are rapists. I think he knew exactly what he was doing and it makes him deplorable.  ,hillaryclinton,d8oheo8,2,t5_2u1c9

9260183,0,t1_d8pryq3,I wouldnt worry too much. For one thing this kind of nationalist fuckstick mindset has been a sickness in this nation since the turn of the last century. Dont forget that the KKK was an organization for proper protestant white men defending American values against black and immigrant hordes back then. Then you have the underlying racism and sexism living on morphing into the Nixonian Law and Order of the sixties. Later it becomes the nascent teaparty terrorism that lead to the Oklahoma City bombing. Again with white supremadcy undertones to say the very ultimate least. Then Obama comes on the scene. It becomes birtherism the occaisional hairbrained terrorist attack that fizzles because of stupid nimrods that cant see beyond their contrained ideology and the general unpalatable nature it holds for sensible Americans. Ordinary black Americans suddenly find cameras in their hands and now the whole nation sees the sick underbelly of racism thats been part of our institutions since their creation every week. So now we see it with the Trump people. Thing is as Ive pointed out its always been there. Its probably always going to be there in some form or another. Some people will never let go of their fantasy of power no matter how utterly its pounded into the ground and ridiculed. The point is  we cant let it stop us or worry us we just have to keep forging on making this country what we want it to be for all of us and dont pay those people any mind. They arent worth it they dont have any real power any more unless we give it to them and once the bright light of what we truly are about shines upon them theyll slink back into the shadows like the cockroaches that they are. You cant bring the hornets nest down without knocking it out of the tree. And doing that means youll almost certainly get stung. But if you want it out of the tree you do it anyway. Bad things might happen. Terrible events may come our way in retaliation but if we want that nest out of the tree we really dont have any choice. We cant fail in this. ,hillaryclinton,d8psmxt,9,t5_2u1c9

9279902,0,t3_57hfrg,Choice cuts from the PPP poll  of Trump voters think that Hillary Clinton should be in prison to only  who disagree with that notion. If you hate the opposing candidate so much you think she should be in jail youre probably not jumping ship. Alex Jones floated the notion this week that Hillary Clinton is actually a demon and  of Trump voters say that they really do think Clinton is a demon to only  who dismiss that idea. This measurement pretty clearly shows that  of Trumps base is the InfoWars crowd so theyre not going to be too dissuaded by allegations of sexual misconduct. Weve talked all year about how theres a cult like aspect to Trumps following and this finding might show it most of all despite everything thats come out in the last week  of Trump voters say they think that he respects women to only  who dont believe he does. Again if youre willing to dismiss all the facts in front of you to the contrary youre probably going to stay on board through election day.Also my favourite thing about PPP is how they keep dragging Jill Stein One final note on the Presidential race we tested Ken Bone as a hypothetical independent candidate and he gets .

9313635,0,t1_d8wagx9,Older Hillary loving millennial woman chiming in! Gonna go ahead and echo uepraider re the woman card. I kinda feel like millennial women in general grew up with a kinda internal sense of I dont want to be good for a girl I just want to be good it fosters a certain rejection of embracing the socalled woman card and also perhaps lends itself to that not like other girls attitude. Further studies have suggested that there isnt as overt a gender penalty at entrylevel jobs so many younger millennial women have yet to experience overt workbased sexism first hand and understand the frustration sacrifices and compromises you have to make to advance your careergoals. In combination I wonder if those two factors dont in part cause younger women to reject Hillary because they feel like shes unfairly playing the woman card something theyve worked hard to avoid and dont really understand the world shes come up in.  Edit I should add that I do not think these are the sole reasons I believe plenty of millennial women have substantive concerns too. Im just saying these feelingsreasons exist in the background and color the way someone younger might look at HRC. ,hillaryclinton,d8wklmw,5,t5_2u1c9

She pretty much did the same thing to him.  Bright side for her he totally waffled over supporting Trump.  The first question of the debate was for both of them Yes or no do you support your partys nominee for president?  McGinty obviously said yes and Toomey pretty much said See she supports Hillary Clinton! and tried to use that against her rather than answer for himself.They asked Toomey later on whether or not he still supports Trump and he still wouldnt answer but said he might disclose his vote between now and the election. ,hillaryclinton,d8ya8a7,1,t5_2u1c9
9327535,0,t1_d8yadx2,Yeah the assassination aspect of it is potentially a dangerous or disturbing kind of commentary but since the object of the game is to prevent it instead of being the one to carry it out that really takes the edge off of it for me and lets me focus on all the background commentary. As the game progresses the situations Trumps enabling get more horrifying based on Trumps own sketchy business record and scary campaign promises and it gets harder to protect him because obviously theres more civil unrest as he becomes progressively more like a dictator with God delusions. So theres definitely an argument to be made by people who feel like the game takes things too far but I do think it has merit.,hillaryclinton,d8yc0lm,3,t5_2u1c9

Gaddafi doesnt even belong in the same category as Hussein and Kim Jong Un. Not all tyrants are equally evil by virtue of their tyranny.  Hillarys involvement in overthrowing Libya is a black smear on her record. She has too low a threshold for what warrants military intervention.

9394178,0,t1_d96r7qx,The comparison of Rubio to Trump is not the same as Sanders to Clinton. Its a false equivalency. If Clinton had no qualifications demeaned her opponent in the most personal and inappropriate of terms and was friends with Ronald Reagan while being a Republican for decades of her adult life maybe it would be a different conversation. But none of that is true. In reality Clinton is a liberal politician with a very similar voting record to Sanders and who has adopted many of his goals which also happen to have been the most contentious points of the primary free college public healthcare medical and family leave. Is she as left as Sanders? No. Do they see eyetoeye on everything? No. But elections arent a zerosum game where either you find the perfect candidate who agrees with you on everything or you just give up and say were screwed either way. Its about finding the person who will accomplish what is most similar to what you want to accomplish. And if you look for even a second its clear to see that if youre a Sanders fan the person who will accomplish what you and Sanders want accomplished is Hillary Clinton. Are there a few points of disagreement here and there? Sure. But theyre close enough. Especially considering the alternative who is diametrically opposed to everything they and you want. So you can either vote for the side youve been on or you can elect the alternative by deciding that nobody is just pure enough for you and staying home or casting a protest vote.,hillaryclinton,d96s12b,4,t5_2u1c9

Murphy dad was putting up the money but Florida market is so expensive and he needed more money for ads. If Murphy ends up losing by a point or two I will blame the DSCC and Chuck Schumer for it.

Comey sent a letter to a bunch of Republicans informing them of this.   Jason Chaffetz tweeted about the the letter.   A bunch of people including former FBI people pointed out that its a huge breach of protocol for the FBI to comment on ongoing investigations.  They usually put everything together and dont say a word until theyre ready to make a decision.

9455866,0,t1_d9ej4ry,I dont think he is going to remain the FBI director even until the th. There is a LOT of pressure on him to resign from both the left AND right. And that means the FBI agents themselves most likely want him to resign because right now the reputation of the agency is in the toilet and that makes it harder for them to do their jobs.The ONLY way in my opinion that he is not asked to resign is if he is doing this because the agency is putting together the case against Donald trump to be prosecuted next year and he is trying to prevent accusations that he Held onto anything that could even remotely have given Trump the presidency and thus the immunity that comes with it. However he completely bungled it when he sent the letter BEFORE they could read even a single email! Again embarrassing the agency.My guess? Obama is giving him the same Monday deadline as the senate. If Comey ignores it Obama will make the call asking for his resignation. Comey in my opinion has to clarify exactly what is going on and how this is extremely unlikely to have anything to do with the prior investigation or reveal any wrongdoing on Clintons part. About how the agency maintains the same stance as when he announced the results of the investigation last time. Stupid but not criminal.,hillaryclinton,d9eljow,2,t5_2u1c9

Click on a state and scroll down and you can see step by step where they get their numbers from starting from the overall poll average. These states all seem to be light blue again right now but at the time of writing you would have seen for example Florida having a Clinton lead in the simple poll average followed by an adjustment of about  in Trumps favour due to trend line which has been enough to turn NC FL and NV various shades of pink this week even though he has never led in s poll averages in those states.,hillaryclinton,d9limzl,1,t5_2u1c9

More than likely theres this small group of NeverTrumpers who have been jerking themselves off over what will turn out to be a relatively innocuous bit of oppo just like they jerked themselves off for months about how they were totally going to revolt against Trump and run a real viable NeverTrump conservative. Which isnt to say that there isnt real oppo out there that Wilson doesnt know about.

9541377,0,t3_5bipli,Question what is yalls stance on taking collective responsibility for the actions of the government?I was thinking about the South Park episode that was made when Iraq War protests were going on during Ws administration and in that episode Cartman has a hallucination where he goes to the drafting of the Constitution and he discovers that the Founding Fathers included the freedom of speech in the Bill of Rights because it gives the government the ability to go to war and the people to complain about it so that we dont face hatred for simply being Americans.In my opinion the electorate should take responsibility for the actions of the government because of the fact that we are a democracy. German voters put Hitler into power and it was just as much the fault of ones who voted for Social Democrats and Communists as it was the ones who voted for the National Socialists. The voting age population of the United States bears as much of the responsibility for the Patriot Act and the Iraq War as President Bush and the members of Congress who voted for it including Hillary as Bernie supporters are quick to point out and members of Congress who didnt. Iraq could have been ended had Kerry been put in in  but the American people definitively said that time that they wanted four more years of Bush.Going into Tuesday we have the fate of our country resting on our shoulders and it follows us into the voting booth and goes home with us and it will be there once the new President is in office and we hold her or him accountable because we are a democracy a government by the people for the people and of the people.Sorry for going on a bit of a rantsoapbox there lol.

Think about it states get the number of electoral votes based on their population. What if they have a huge population but only a very small portion compared to other states of that population votes. That means those few votes from that state count more than voters from other states. It gives more weight to people who live in states with high populations and low voter turn out. It also gives more weight to swing states such as Ohio and Michigan rather than to high population states like California and Texas.

I can say this as a veteran of several elections down here in Australia where various right wing troglodytes have won convincingly looking to be in power for a generation only to fuck it up for themselves a year or two down the line. I totally get the feelings of sadness and helplessness you must be feeling now but ultimately theyre not terribly useful emotions. Use them as a motivation to get back up because youre sorely needed.Things look dire for American progressives now but theyll get better  particularly if we use this as a wake up call instead of an excuse to disengage. And remember this is Donald Trump were talking about here  the very things that scare us about him are also his greatest weaknesses. I doubt weve scratched the surface of the cesspit that is his past or just how unprepared he is for the office hell hold. And you know you look on the bright side.

9710416,0,t3_5dwep9,Sorry but playing this blame game where your candidate had nothing to do with losing her own election is going to continue to put voters off and lose the Democrats power. I supported Bernie in the primary and voted for Hillary in the general. I saw the need for unity in the face of a firebreathing maniac knowing that while I could survive a Trump presidency unscathed many many others could not. I ask no credit for that it was just the human thing to do.But honestly to anyone outside this subreddit this looks like deflectionegopreservation...and Ive been a reader here for many many months. Im almost positive that in the future analysis of this election wont show that Bernie or Bust or Bernie himself had much to do with the loss. IIRC polls indelicated that most Bernie primary supporters were voting for Clinton in the election.I personally dont see how the economyfocused message took away from his other positions on civil rights which were very very similar. Is it that despite supporting the same legislation he just didnt talk about it enough? And I know this is a touchy thing but as much as you want to call his platform a product of white male privilege that is exactly some of the demographic you need to win an election. Their votes matter. Other than a mass populist movement focusing on the economy which affects tensions across all races and genders how do you plan on winning next time? This is an honest nonfacetious question.Regardless I know Im not gonna be guilted over something I didnt cause. If everyone here wants to retreat back and cling onto the Democratic Party that just lost the election youre in for a harsh awakening in  and .EDIT Also for the record I fully believe white male privilege is a thing but I just dont see how its relevant here. If white males voted for Trump they werent on board with either Hillary OR Bernie in the first place. Because people who were truly with Bernie should have voted for Hillary. How is it Bernies fault?,hillaryclinton,daa0n5r,6,t5_2u1c9

9721563,0,t1_dabclkp,Theres a lot of stuff in your comment that there are different perspectives on and Im sure uReimiS would be better to talk to about bathroom bills.  However I certainly recognize that the situation is rather sensitive.  I feel like ftm transgender people are perhaps most at risk with the North Carolina bill  people who present look and identify as men being forced to use the womens bathroom is going to lead to problems Im sure.However as a gay man I have a lot of concerns with the FADA.  We decided back in  that it was not ok for a business which serves the public to discriminate against parts of the public.  We protected race gender religion and national origin.  You cant refuse to serve people based off of broad criteria  we as a nation decided that was wrong.  Why go back on that now?People sometimes claim that oh the public opinion will punish a company who is bigoted but I recall when the news broke about ChickfilAs stance on gay marriage.  People flooded their businesses with support.  Donations go pouring in to companies like that.  People sometimes argue dont go to a business that doesnt like you I wouldnt shop somewhere that hated me! but that ignores a central issue  if I have to restrict where I can get my products from based on whether or not they will serve me doesnt that make me a second class citizen?And speaking of second class citizens the civil union distinction is exactly that.  You can make them as equal as you want in every right and every aspect but they are still separate.  And separate is most certainly not equal.  The connotation which will follow in the publics perception will be that gay civil unions are not equal to real marriages.  No matter how much the government might want them to be equal concepts they wont be  a different name means that there is a difference.  And thats exactly why people want civil unions not marriage because they think there is a difference.I appreciate the approach some people are taking now of calling their spouse a partner rather than husband or wife.  Its a blurring of the line.  Now that gay marriage is legal if you dont specify the gender of your spouse people cant make assumptions based on that.  And really its private after all right?Those are some of my concerns and perspectives I hope you found it helpful!,hillaryclinton,dabe7r0,1,t5_2u1c9

10066944,0,t1_dbjq8u8,I have some sympathy for the ones that believe all politics and politicians are inherently corrupt because of the money changing hands in our political system  and that everyone involved is thus compromised to a greater or lesser degree by engaging with it. I feel that there is some truth to that but you have to actually be involved to change anything Im of no doubt that Hillary and Bernie and heck half the party would like the corporate and wealthy donors to have less influence though the money they can wield however it is not the reality with which we have to work. Until we can do something to remove the need for countless millions to run campaigns money will have a undue influence. It isnt right in my opinion but refusing to take any money standing on principal in this case wont help though we should be working towards creating a situation where that is possible. What I really cant stand is the suggestion however that the  corruption runs equally deep on both sides of the isle and that somehow Hillary personifies it because that just isnt supported by evidence in my opinion.  ,hillaryclinton,dbjqv15,10,t5_2u1c9

Been sort of depressed like a lot of you probably have been since election day.Sorry if this has been discussed but something that has pissed me off is Hillarys sudden postelection surge in popularity on social media. Her tweets are being retweeted out the wazoo now. People now see her as some kind of graceful loser bastion of much needed wisdom or whatever proxy they see her as that suits them. Its suddenly cool to like her now that shes lost and people are treating her like the only adult in the room. People have come out for Hillary now that its over and shes more popular on twitter than ever. It really bothers me. The same respect should have been shown during the campaign. None of it was there. So much was about her emails or how she wasnt relatable and now suddenly she is getting the respect she deserves as a wise political powerhouse when she needed that respect months ago.So all these johnny come latelys to the Hillary support all I say is say something before the election next time instead of just passively standing to the side and assuming the more experienced and sane candidate will win without your support.

That bill almost passed. We need all the dems on the same page. And the only way to define the page is to have an open conversation where were all listening to each other. Its not a war. Its a conversation. Start treating it like that.Also I highly recommend reminding them to do as follows. Vote from progressive candidates when possible.. If that is not possible vote for the next best thing within party lines.. If that is not possible vote for the next best thing outside party lines.Rather than falling back on the tempting burn this shit down kneejerk response that comes about due to stress and frustration.

Thats a fair criticism but it also needs to be balanced with the knowledge that the DNC itself is not all that powerful hell Obama built his own organization in  because he knew the DNC wasnt great and couldnt be relied on and you didnt see him whining about it.

10671291,0,t1_ddgm0oh,But we dont need a single payer system! There are other options that are equally workable that are much closer to the system we already have. France Germany Belgium Austria Luxembourg South Korea and Switzerland are all examples of effective universal healthcare that do not rely on single payer. And there are a great many countries with a two tier system that would also be closer to what we have now. A Medicaidstyle program for those in need but an insurance mandate for the rest. I truly wish the left would realize there is more than one path to universal healthcare. Sure single payer can work but so can other mechanisms based on insurance mandates and regulation.Additionally sure you can find some polls supporting single payer healthcare  with the caveats that taxes do not increase they do not need to change doctors they dont have to give up employer based coverage and we do not experience longer wait times for non emergency services. All of which would occur to one degree or another. Which means youre pointing to phantom support of a nonexistent policy prescription. Pursuing a policy more akin to Germany by a for example would entail significantly less disruption to our current modus operandi.

If there were more than two days left maybe thered be a chance but it would be a hell of an upset if Thompson won at this point.,hillaryclinton,dg1cq1f,4,t5_2u1c9

11588773,0,t1_dg9g3f3,Yeah they base it on polls even though the polls were wrong throughout the entire election so they cant say with such certainty and smugness. He probably could have carried states that were razor thin blue wall states but its hard to tell. The issue is whether dem voters would have turned out. Im not sure those essays would have destroyed him against the access Hollywood tape but there may have been something else that was worse. Plus Donald Trump plays with no rules so its too hard to figure out what wouldve happened in a crazy year. ,hillaryclinton,dg9lfa7,17,t5_2u1c9

11658554,0,t1_dgghkxj,Bernie did the opposite of what was claimed by the Hillary camp during primaries that he wouldnt support the party or down ballot races if he didnt win. He not only campaigned for Hillary but has continued to support down ballot races to this day and is still on tour with Tom Perez doing that right now. I cant speak on this particular instance where he didnt defend Hillary at one rally you mention but Id say his response that he was campaigning for her shows who he supported. I dont know where you get the idea that he has been tearing down the party candidates or policies as he done the exact opposite of that since the primaries and continues to do so. ,hillaryclinton,dghifj1,2,t5_2u1c9

11717281,0,t1_dgo66bj,Oh come on.  Im not saying she has anything of value to say but defending her right to free speech is hardly sanctioning hate speech.  Besides the fact that one can argue that hate speech is free speech.  Fighting words direct appeals to violence are illegal but racism abhorrent as it may be is not.    She was invited by a group of people interested in seeing her.  No one has to go and theyre free to protest her.  But I disagree with basically allowing small groups of people to intimidate them into not inviting her and from what the school said it was mainly security issues that were the reason.  Personally if she was on my campus I would consider going.  I think it would be mildly interesting and I think theres some value in watching flamethrowers like her so that you can recognize their patterns.  ,hillaryclinton,dgo6ljf,7,t5_2u1c9

I told them I will not donate another dime until they focus on democrats and focus on new people who want to join our party. Im sick and tired of Bernie and I want him to go away.

11759409,0,t1_dgsxysh,Ill take a look at the articles you linked. I dont consider myself an expert but I have been following the issues with college campuses for the last couple years so I feel like I have a decent general view.  My statement was based partially on this article which basically attempts to justify the practice is by a young person who is either fresh out of college or close and makes sense given everything else Ive seen.  Part of the problem is it tends to be hard to find people who are neither racist nor dismissing of legitimate racial issues.  Some of the best ones Ive found on the subject are Conor Friedersdorf Wendy Kaminer and John McWhortor.  This debate featuring Kaminer and McWhorter and Shaun Hill and Jason Stanley is pretty good.  ,hillaryclinton,dgsyizv,4,t5_2u1c9
