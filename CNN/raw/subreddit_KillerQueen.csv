11375574,0,t1_dfkxvnz,I agree with getting paid. Otherwise people can start to feel resentful I do all this junk for nothing and I barely get a thank you. No one has a clue how much effort.I help organize STLs scene. Its a passing though Ive had but on the whole I really enjoy it. But it takes a lot of time an effort promoting the game here organizing and running weekly tournaments rounding people up etc. It can be herding cats in a busy bar.,KillerQueen,dflehao,1,t5_2qj85
