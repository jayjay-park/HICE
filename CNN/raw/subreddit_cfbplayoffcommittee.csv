2242435,0,t3_2ktxew,FSU  Louisville  On every metric but turnovers FSU outplayed Louisville and the Cardinals were only in this game due to Winstons three picks in the first half.  It doesnt surprise me that when the picks dried up so did Louisvilles scoring they just couldnt get any field position with their offense or special teams.  I actually think Louisvilles runstopping defense wasnt the best shot at slowing down FSU given that they dont really want to run in the first place.  However between Dyers success running the ball and the breakdowns in Louisvilles secondary Im now more interested in the FSU  Miami game as the most likely ACC road loss.,cfbplayoffcommittee,clov7ln,5,t5_2yfyq

2328902,0,t1_clzilur,The AuburnNebraskaUCLA triangle is difficult for me because I use the eyetest mixed in with resume and injuries. So do I punish UCLAs ASU win and to what degree? Nebraska is playing amazing football and came a late pick away from being undefeated so do they slot behind loss teams with better wins?Auburn has finally failed the eye test too. They got into a shoot out with a bad USCe team then were a freak injury away from losing to Ole Miss and then had major mental errors at home against a bad AampM team not what you would expect from one of the nations top teams.Auburn should probably be up in tier . But I cant nail down where to put them in order.And no disrespect meant to Boise at all! ,cfbplayoffcommittee,clzkcup,1,t5_2yfyq
2374608,0,t1_cm541r2,Its certainly going to be harder to get bowl eligible in a conference with  conference games as seen by Oregon and TCU but yes thats interesting.

I really think theyve been a victim of unattainable preseason hype  hell hath no fury like a pundit scorned I suppose.Georgia is so incredibly frustrating.  Im not sure I see any other team in the country where theres a stronger contrast between good deep wins and crippling losses.  Im really interested to see COFH and the CCG.,cfbplayoffcommittee,cm5o7ds,2,t5_2yfyq
2442495,0,t1_cmdlduw,I want to discuss Georgia Tech because I think their chances of going to the Orange Bowl are slim.  I dont know how predictive we should go but my feelings are that either they beat FSU in the ACCCG and still dont go to the Orange Bowl because FSU would fall to that spot or FSU thumps them and they fall as well although the question is how much would the committee punish a team for losing in a CCG to a playoff bound team?Am I wrong?,cfbplayoffcommittee,cmdlica,1,t5_2yfyq

Virginia Tech Ohio St.Arizona has an extra loss but we are all willing to put teams with more losses than fewer if the resume outweighs it this is why almost everyone has one or both of Alabama and Oregon ahead of FSU.  Arizona has the better wins and while they have an extra loss is it enough of a hindrance to hold them back despite the better wins?  Especially when both teams they lost to are better than the teams Ohio St. and Baylors?Im feeling like Arizona deserves the same despite the loss bump we give Oregon and Alabama.

5230153,0,t1_cvgeond,Now were kind of back to what I was saying before though... about not recruiting a QB for the offense.  I dont really consider panicking and getting Adams as a transfer recruiting either.  Had Adams say put at EWU youd have Lockie that Allie guy that took over last night and that highly rated freshman you redshirted whose name slips my mind as your QB situation.  Thats pretty awful.  I cant believe that the coaching staff couldnt play the Be Mariotas replacement card  years ago or  years ago in order to get someone decent into the fold.  Especially given that they have been making it work with athletic star guys all along.  Many should be jumping at the chance to start for Oregon rather than be converted to a CB for LSU. ,cfbplayoffcommittee,cvgfao7,1,t5_2yfyq
5428190,0,t3_3pco7h,Coming in hot!  Im doing mostly eyetest but trying to start incorporating resume just too early to base solely off resume IMO.. Utah  best resume by quite a bit in what I consider to be the best conference.. TCU  I still think theyre better than Baylor and I think theyre gradually improving weektoweek.. Ohio State  Still the most talented team in the country.  If Urban ever truly gives the reigns to JT watch out.. LSU  I give them a slight nod over Baylor and Clemson but I still dont know that either has played a really good team.  UF is bolstered by the Ole Miss win which looks a lot worse this week and you still have to count the ugly wins over Syracuse EMU and MSU.  LSU could be great but theyll need more than one dimension against Saban in two weeks.. Clemson  They havent really looked the part but like FSU last year they keep finding a way to win.  I love Watson but need to see a little more consistency on both sides of the ball.. Michigan State  I think theyre a great team but at the end of the day they barely beat two teams at home that are marquee wins and throw in the close calls to Purdue and Rutgers and Im not really sure what this team is.  I dont know if they played UM on a neutral field ten times that they would win the majority.. Baylor  I keep feeling like Im missing something with Baylor.  Their SOS by Sagarin standards is th and theyve played four of their six games against teams outside of the top  in Sagarins rankings.  If Baylor makes the dance theyll certainly have to earn it after this weekends layup against ISU they finish the season after a bye like this KSU OK OKST TCU TX.. I still think they probably wind up with two or three losses.Next AlabamaCaliforniaFlorida StateIowaMemphisNotre DameStanford,cfbplayoffcommittee,cw5i9kb,1,t5_2yfyq
5481092,0,t1_cwbjz63,I found reading this discussion to be very interesting and Im glad you both kept it fairly civil.  Some responses Members are allowed to use any ranking methodology they want including something totally arbitrary like the attractiveness of team uniforms.  The only requirements for membership are consistently turning in ballots and participating civilly in discussion. I agree with uTheCid that a computer algorithm is simply a tool one crafted by a voter to put teams into the order that he or she would like.  Its no different than using a pencil and paper to tally notes about teams.  Technology regardless of how sophisticated it is always reflects the will of its creator. However I also agree with uatchemey that it would be awfully boring to shut down conversation by saying Well thats interesting but Im bound by my poll so its moot.  So in addition to participating in discussion about why your poll produces certain results and possibly tweaks you might want to make to it in the future I challenge you include in your discussion posts some commentary about teams that you think based on your eyetest your poll is wrong about at the moment and suspect will move up or down in coming weeks.  That way people who do prefer an eyetestbased evaluation will have something to talk to you about within the same framework. In response to the comment about the previous member who used F rankings not working out that was not the case.  Those rankings were perfectly valid and actually predicted the future order of the rest of the committee by a few weeks on most occasions.  That member left for personal reasons not because of any difficulty with that methodology. Conversational consensus is a valid way of arriving at descriptive or normative theories Habermas is an advocate but it isnt the one we use here.  Discussion is a courtesy and a means for members to encourage critical thinking but there is no coercive epistemology in this process.  Members can and do submit wildly divergent ballots theyre averaged to produce each step in the process and voters need not have any confidence in the outcome or requirement to change their beliefs as a result.,cfbplayoffcommittee,cwc9egv,1,t5_2yfyq

FloridaOSU and Baylor are teams with relatively weak resumes but one blowout of a decent team Penn State and Texas Tech who have generally looked good against weak competition.  No one else on the list has looked as consistently good against their also weak resumes.Iowa has the best resume but I really dont think theyre playing that well right now and I also dont think Pitt or Wisconsin is all that good.  Just better than most of the other resumes out there.TCU has a weak resume and has played too close too often but they are undefeated.I have Notre Dame on top of the one loss teams.  Their one loss is to the top team in the country and they have a lot of depth to their schedule so far despite not really having any marquee wins.  I think there is a three team tier here with them Stanford and Alabama.  Stanford is above Alabama because I think Northwestern would beat Ole Miss on a neutral field.Utah and Florida is my last tier.  I think Floridas loss is definitely better but Utah has much better wins.For G Ive been voting both Memphis and Temple in the next six for both weeks now and I think both of them are deserving but right now Memphis has the stronger schedule so Im going with them for G rep.
