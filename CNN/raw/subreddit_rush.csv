6482052,0,t3_44bhbl,My alltime favourite Rush song its such a masterpiece. That main Camera Eye riff you hear throughout the song is so catchy I never get tired of hearing it.  The oozing synths and city street sounds at the start give the song such a great atmosphere right off the bat. Neils drums are at their finest with some amazing fills found through out. The solo is also one of their best solos ever  Alexs screechy guitar is in top form and I love the backing melody from Geddy and Neil during it. Its so cool to me how you can hear Geddy replicating that awesome main riff Geddys vocals are fantastic as well and I love Neils lyrics. My interpretation of the comparison between New York and London is that it can be extended to all cities. They might have minute differences but at their core all cities are built on similar foundations. I think thats realized most through the line a light unique to every citys streets. Also this interpretation makes sense I think when you consider how similar the structure of the two sections is. Repetition actually serves a good purpose in this song.,rush,czpsjir,1,t5_2r4wq

6552685,0,t3_45czzo,Geddy used a Mini Moog for leads. Look into a used Novation Bass Station II. A big part of the Moog sound is the db  pole ladder filter. The Novation has a similar filter and will you get you close to the Moogy goodness. Theyre  used. I own a Moog Minitaur and I use it for all kinds of Rush sounds so fun playing Xanadu! the Minitaur is another good option at  used. Another cheap option is a Micro Korg  used it is a  voice poly VA synth as opposed to the Analog Monos mentioned above but it will hack out convincing Moogy leads and even has a decent set of Oberheimesque patches if you wanna try and program that famous Tom Sawyer growlThe modern equivalent of what Geddy used would be a Moog Sub and DSI Oberheim OB... But these are .k and k synths,rush,czx3nrx,2,t5_2r4wq

Her nonfiction books give a little more insight and clarity though. If you want to skip reading the fiction ones and get straight into what she actually believes go read her first nonfiction For The New Intellectual. A few of those speeches I mentioned are in the book and the title essay speaks about what philosophy has gotten wrong through its history. The Virtue Of Selfishness contains some of her most notable essays from her Objectivist Newsletter. Finally youll want to have a look at Leonard Peikoffs Objectivism The Philosophy Of Ayn Rand. This pretty much sums up her philosophy and states everything very clearly.

8942080,0,t1_d7fsmn2,Also if you listen to Signals carefully and concentrate on Alex youll notice that Geddy brought in synth as a lead instrument and Alex continued his Moving Pictures style of soloing to the album. They sacked the producer after Signals but Alex took a long hard look at himself and then on GUP you see this new and improved Alex. His sound changed and so did his style and IMHO Geddy found the right freedom to express himself on synth just coz Alex gave him that space and his guitars lend such a great context to the album.

Never mind the keyboards being turned down why an I suddenly able to hear more crispness from Alexs guitar strikes? Why am I able to hear more vibrato from the violin? Why does the guitar sound separated from the keyboard instead of blended in?Im thinking that the original must have had a lot of reverb added in final mixing. I thought it was just Geddys voice on the first listen. But now I think it was everything. It made the guitar work and Geddys vocal and yeah the violin sound muddy. Alex in particular sounds a whole lot more like he did on Vital Signs. ,rush,d87yx0k,1,t5_2r4wq

9356997,0,t3_58iot4,Ill cement my reputation as the Rush contrarian by chiming in here. I like Hold Your Fire.I like Mission.Hold your fire keep it burning bright. Hold the flame til the dream ignites. A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission.To me its an easygoing tune about pursuing your dreams with a passion and persistence to realize them in the end through spirit and vision. Its motivating and beautiful to me and I just turned it up and grooved to it again while I wrote this. It helps me focus on doing new things.I really like Prime Mover.From the point of ignition to the final drive the point of the journey is not to arrive. Anything can happen.Maybe this one thematically comes after Mission. This is about taking the steps to realize the dreams youve had a common RushPeart theme  see Dreamline Clockwork Angles etc and discovering that the world is an entropic place full of unpredictable complications and diversions that sometimes take you where you ought to go rather than where you thought you wanted to. The point of the journey is to learn and grow and love your experience. It feels like a relative to Grand Designs about combining order and chaos and the dichotomy of pattern and entropy. A common theme that resonates strongly with me.I LOVE Time Stand Still.Though I was a casual Rush fan Tom Sawyer and then Presto in the s and deepened my knowledge of them in the s with Roll The Bones and Counterparts I didnt know this Rush song until  at McMurdo Station Antarctica Dreamline took me there   when a buddy of mine assisting the Live From Antarctica crew used it in a video Ive loved it ever since. In my mind its one step further on the metaphorical journey that links these songs and others in the Rush pantheon. Here the pilgrim has gone far and long on the journey but has lost some of the initial wideeyed openness that sparked the first steps. They are now recognizing the need to slow down to savor each moment properly and ensure theyre really getting the whole meaning of the experience. This verse Summers going fast nights growing colder. Children growing up old friends growing older. hits me hard every year around my lateautumn birthday as I realize another year has passed and Ive missed opportunities to connect better with my friends and family and live mindfully through my experiences.  It makes me cry with emotion. Musically I think it sounds great and I even enjoy the Aimee Mann.I enjoy Force Ten Turn The Page Second Nature High Water Open Secrets and yes even Tai Shan. Of the whole album only Lock and Key doesnt do much for me. I actually hadnt really listened to Open Secrets much before today. Its like a first take on interpersonal themes that matured later on Counterparts. Lock and Key has similar themes about looking inside ourselves at the darkness. Force Ten is a bit of a mystery. I like it musically and lyrically but Im not sure I know exactly what its about or why it was written. You cant say no to Dance and dream like lovers. Attack the day like birds of prey.Second Nature is a nice riff on the ideas of coming together to make the world a better place. Lyrically its interesting but it seems to lack much punch musically and emotionally. Turn the Page seems to me to be about keeping an open mind and not letting yourself be closed off to new understandings even painful. Sort of a side dish to the Big Three themes I call out at the top here. I dont think its as powerful muscially as I would hope for but its good.Tai Shan. And now we come to Tai Shan. If youve read Pearts books you know of his trips including bicycling in China and Africa. Some of his African experiences later manifest in The Larger Bowl and Workin Them Angels Snakes and Arrows and clearly he felt moved to compose something that expressed the way he felt in China. Its not bad but its not amazing. Should it have been included on the mainstream album Hold Your Fire? Maybe not. Apparently they were trying to take it to ten songs and Force Ten itself was hastily crafted to accomplish this. Perhaps Tai Shan wouldnt have made the cut if there were other material and maybe wed never have seen. Still I appreciate the insight of it not getting lost never to be heard. Id love to hear more of the studio cuts and demo material that never made it to albums. Tai Shan exists and everyone can be a little awkwardly uncomfortable about it but it is what it is and it is one more piece of the puzzle that is Rush Peart Lee and Lifeson.Its clear the album does mostly fulfil the themes of Time and Instinct that the Wikipedia writeup says were core to it and its also clear that it was a step back and breathe and explore project. Some things could be better some are good and some are great. I enjoy it a lot and I enjoyed relistening to it today.,rush,d922exi,3,t5_2r4wq

How is he obligated in any way to Yes or to the HOF?He doesnt owe anybody in the industry anything.I guarantee that if Alex or Geddy needed him for something hed be there in a second just like they were there for him when his wife and daughter died.

10631100,0,t3_5s5fch,Hey Dan! I saw NSPTWRP live in Chicago and there was an amazing instrumental that played right before the song Heat of the Moment. Is that a live show only song or will it be on an upcoming album? P.S. Youre the reason I listened to Hemispheres for the first time so thanks!,rush,ddcimkw,10,t5_2r4wq

10766074,0,t3_5tx9nv,Aesthetically its the Rick . In my opinion the  is the coolest looking bass of them all. For sound its the Fender Jazz all the way. The Rick has a cool unique sound but Ive always thought it has a little too much high end. The Jazz bass has the perfect mix. ,rush,ddqfvkb,2,t5_2r4wq

11199598,0,t1_dex8g70,Pain and old age. Not putting shade on the man but thats the deal. He cant do it anymore and was suffering physically even on R. Dont blame the guy. He wants to be remembered as the best fucking rock drummer ever. Not as a shadow of his past accomplishments. I think that Geddy and Alex will work together again. Though it wont be Rush. Theyd have no intention of disrespecting Neil by using the band name. In my opinion of course. ,rush,df1gljb,3,t5_2r4wq
