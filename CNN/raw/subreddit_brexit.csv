Its also disingenuous to tie that point to a quip about Syria being in the EU.  You make it seem as though its impossible that large numbers of Syrian and middle eastern refugees will be able to gain access to the EU and thus Britain.  How are those migrants working out for Germany and Sweden?  Any uptick in crime at all?  Ill let you take a guess.In regards to the unelected politicians yes they may be unelected but at least you will have a clearer path of recourse than with the bureaucrats in Brussels.   With the job stealing argument we will see if companies prefer working in a country with higher regulations and taxes as opposed to a freer market and economy.  Competition is ultimately good for the end user right?  Lets let the markets decide.  Plus I doubt the EU will be able to continue in its current form as many other countries will now be looking to leave.  There was always going to be a drop in the markets as they all hate uncertainty.  They will correct and we will move on.  Its a bit unfair to already quote currency devaluation no less than  hours after a vote.  This knee jerk reaction to the Leavers is petty and we should take a step back and look down the line a bit.

8134381,0,t1_d4ra9pj,You linked this in another topic. So I guess I just tell you what I think when looking at these numbers.Loss of confidence will cause local investment and FDI to decrease in the short term.Well this is the selffulfilling prophecy you see a lot in economics. People say it will be bad so they get afraid what results in less investment or people buying less what that can indeed have a negative effect.Its similar to how if a person who people look up to starts telling a bank is about to fail so people should all take their money of. People doing that will make the bank fail.On the other hand once things calm down and the economy would rise up again this would increase again as well.So for now this is short term.Because of this economic slowdown the Bank of England is expected to need to inject bn of stimulus but a lot of analysts are still predicting a recession  Maybe and then what happens after? Might also be short term and is still more guessing. I think they first have to look at how this will continue to go.Inflation is on the rise due to pressures from both the deflating pound and the expected interest rate cut from . gt . The BoE is more worried about providing liquidity atm and will worry about inflation later and this isnt really a huge deal unless it goes on for a long time. So short term for now.Altough exports do benefit from a falling pound the combination of shortmedium term depending on negotations loss of supply chain plus drop in domestic spending comes nowhere close to outweighing benefits The pound did fall but we also have to see it in a perspective. Here are the charts showing what the pound has been doing.  Now if you put it on  week hurry!   it looks extreme. But now put it on  year. First thing to notice is that it went up just before the Brexit because of people betting on a leave. So to have a fair idea about the drop you should but the value before the drop somewhere at  . where it is now at .. That is a lot but its a similar drop as we have seen between January of  where it was at . to April ..  Looking back for  years you see that you currently are back where you where in . You did survive that back then.So as long as the free fall does not continue there is also no real reason to panic yet. Again this is more short term.Growth projections revised down . depending on which bank you look at through  for the UK causing a . GDP drop for UK and . GDP drop worldwide. This also leads back to the possible recession.First of all this is a projection and an initial hit was expected.. The question is where the UK is  years after you are really out of the EU.An increasing public deficit and current account balance see twin deficit Because of what?In the long run the big problem is just being able to reintegrate with the global economy.I agree its all about getting that new treaty. So they should try to make a good deal with the EU and try to do it within  years. Also they should start making deals with other countries. This is a political challenge.If they do a terrible job that is a problem if they do a good job it can be great. But I see this more as a indirect result of the Brexit. The questions is.. what happens in the long run when they get a fair trade deal in a reasonable time. Remember Article  means that noting really changes for at least  years if you do not yet have a deal. So they should set that  years period as a goal. Then I talk about the deal with the EU and some other important ones with other countries.So these are interesting numbers but mainly short term partly still unsure and some seem big until you look at them on a bigger scale.,brexit,d4udm9s,1,t5_33mm8

9784587,0,t1_daj3ria,I think that as far as possible the idea of what the UK wants from the negotiations should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I dont think it should be an adhoc or ongoing process but rather something that is done before the bill to trigger Article  is brought to the House. The issue with letting the government get on with things before presenting a fullyformed deal for Parliament to amend reject or accept is that its extraordinarily unlikely that the deal will meaningfully satisfy a majority of voters. Giving parliament the power to shape the deal as its made will be the best way to ensure that it is representative of the voters desires.The challenges being brought so far seem to be along the lines of process rather than substance ensuring that the process followed is unquestionably within the bounds of the law. I find it hard to understand Leavers well the Daily Mail at least who froth at the mouth about this. What if May had already triggered Article  then it was ruled that she had acted unlawfully? That would be a serious barrier to leaving. Brexit is without a doubt the most complex undertaking in the history of the UK government. It will completely redefine the existence of our country if not permanently then for at least two generations. Once it is done it cannot be undone in the sense of being able to return to anything resembling the current status quo. Once it is done it should not be credible for anyone to meaningfully call the process or its outcomes into question. There will be detractors and there will be unhappy voters. That unfortunately is what happens in a Democracy. But the unhappy minority should be much much smaller than it currently is and much less unhappy to boot.,brexit,daj5wcg,1,t5_33mm8

What a boom for British regional development arts science and so on.According to the Kings Fund the NHS has recently found itself generating a .bn structural deficit. Lets patch that up with an extra  of margin leaving us with .bn.Thats a fair bit of change. Weve already covered x the social spending the EU contributes to social funds but I guess it wouldnt hurt to pay the UK Horizon  guys a th time for this year leaving us with about M which I suppose could be used to build a hospital or something.,brexit,de915zj,1,t5_33mm8
10999828,0,t1_deer3zr,Nope unfortunately Tusk and Merkel flat out refused to guarantee anything until Article  talks have begun again I cant post the link due to the phone app but a quick Google search is your friend back in November  so there should be absolutely no reason for us to guarantee anything until Article  has been invoked as that will only leave us high and dry going in. A deal will be reached though no doubt. We have something they want  The City of London.Also no offence but your sources are mainly from largely proEuropean news outlets so I am quite the sceptic of bias media both left and right but I appreciate the response nonetheless.,brexit,deesq51,3,t5_33mm8

11168666,0,t1_dexuz4x,Thanks but Im in China at the moment so Im guessing itll be too much of a hike!Well its all a bit too early to say definitively but at the very least we can say there hasnt been the collapse in business and consumer confidence that many expected. Even if theres no deal on permanent arrangements then presuming theres transitional arrangements and its difficult to imagine the EU would like massive tailbacks into Rotterdam Hamburg ports or EU companies suddenly being cut off from the Citys capital pools then economic damage will be a slow drawnout affair very possibly rendered imperceptible by countervailing natural growth government intervention new trade deals etc.Anyway it seems to be your task to accentuate the positive in an uncertain world!,brexit,dexyfyl,2,t5_33mm8

11418909,0,t1_dfq92yt,Well if the EU is unable to guarantee Gibraltars continued existence as part of British sovereign territory as has clearly been the wish of the people of Gibraltar I can understand Mr Howards reaction.If the EU did that to us with for the sake of example France claiming that the Swiss sovereignty of longlost parts of the Canton of Vaud is invalid with Brussels fully supporting these interests in the background while unwilling to officially restrict its intentions in any clear matter the roads and bridges would be blown up within hours. ,brexit,dfqbl7p,2,t5_33mm8
11447841,0,t1_dfs66d2,Spain is one of the  members remaining EU members. So should the EU have overruled a long standing territorial claim from one of its loyal remaining member states?Yeah ok but cmon its spain its not like its a real country. The only reason any of them have jobs is because germans keep paying them to build roads.,brexit,dftlprn,0,t5_33mm8

11636055,0,t1_dgexpvg,Not really no. Brexit is the will of the people. If the Tories lose they wont Brexiteers will claim this is a judgement of May and not the referendum result. If they win it will be vindication that Hard Brexit is what the people want. Either way Brexit is not going to stop.,brexit,dgeyk3x,5,t5_33mm8
