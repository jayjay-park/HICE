10877292,0,t1_de1fl6l,I havent seen many Korean movies but the ones Ive been have been excellent like gwansang very depressing very long but it was well done and i loved the acting the casting. I cant stand korean dramas at all. theyre all unwatchable for some reason . I understand Korean so some of the dialogue sounds more annoyingwhiney than if you didnt understand Korean  though Im sure you can tell when stuff sounds annoying or whiney.,JapaneseMovies,de1wyjt,1,t5_31hj6
