6066623,0,t1_cyefrbl,Yeah Im glad you realize I was joking with you. People on here are so sensitive sometimes. DAs far as Japanese albums are concerned Deep River is one of teh few albums I can personally listen to from beginning to end and not skip a single song. It covers all manner or genre from pop to experimental ballad rock electronica and even songs that cant even be classified like Sakura Drops. I just feel like if someone had never heard a Japanese album before a great place to start would either be Utada Hikarus Deep River or Nakashima Mikas LOVE.,jpop,cyetq9g,1,t5_2rmjc

6275748,0,t1_cyw3xyp,Okay so. Sakura was good but I actually like the english version by Ailee better. Faith was good.Be my last was really good one of the best Ive been directed to on here. A song for you I liked crystal Kay original better than the cover P Yours only was pretty good.Jewel I really liked it and Im assuming that was a short version so Ill go and download the whole version tonight If I cant have you sounds very s but it was still good Believe in love was really good. Anna is amazing and I never realized. Whatever the last one was called was good but bad quality. Thanks for the recommendations!  ,jpop,cz2zcoh,1,t5_2rmjc

6811755,0,t1_d0oeosh,Most likely  at the most . That video is too many for sure and not at a school for the most part. The one im thinking of was inside of a school and each girl had their own little singing part in a different room in the school and then they all went to the roof to do a dance number for the chorus. They were also young girls. Like probably a  yr old group.,jpop,d0oer54,1,t5_2rmjc

7205024,0,t3_4e55jh,Well as someone who has been listening to Jpop and Kpop for over  years I think I have the answer Jpop as a whole caters to a very Japanese way of understanding music. While you will see Western influence in Japanese music it is still primarily a very Japanese sound that is an acquired taste for anyone outside of the understanding of Japanese culture. Its like Indian music for instance. Bollywood music is INSANELY popular in India but it is not really that popular anywhere else. That is becasue Indian music caters to the Indian ear and the music is made to only be appreciated by someone with an understanding of what makes Indian music different from other types of music.Now you have South Korean music that tries so hard to be Western. They see what they think is popular in places like the U.S. and Europe more so the U.S. than Europe and try to emulate it as the music from the U.S. is pretty much enjoyed the world over for better of for worse. Since Kpop is more of a business than an actual style of music it emulates whatever is popular and if you notice that over the years the style has changed to reflect what is popular throughout the world as a whole. In the early s alt.Rock was the height of popularity so you saw a lot of Korean Rock artists doing rock music. In the late searly s it was all about the boy bands so Korea answered in turn. In  the popularity is in urban sounding music and EDMDance so that is why current music sounds a lot like what is popular on American radio. S.Korean record companies want to make money and will do so by emulating anything they see is being copied throughout the world.I have been listening to Kpop since Generation  so I understand artists like Park Ji Yoon JYP J.ae FinK.L. BabyVOX Shinhwa H.O.T. ect. made music that was very much Korean while still incorporating influences from the West. Now you have so many hiphop artists RampB singers and Dance artists that sound like Western music with Korean lyrics because they want people who are used to American music to say This sounds just like music form the U.S. but in Korean. The industry follows what is popular in the countries it sees making the most money regardless of what that style is.In short Kpop is more popular than Jpop throughout the world because the former has simply become Pop music that happens to be in Korean versus the latter being pop music made for Japanese audiences. Jpop has a very distinct sound that is usually only appealing to people who appreciate and understand Japanese culture while Kpop is designed to be palatable by as wide an audience as possible. In short Jpop doesnt want to be popular outside of Japan because it isnt made for foreigners. Kpop on the other hand is in the business of making money and will copy anything that sounds looks and feels popular especially if it is at the expense of what makes it Korean music in the first place.,jpop,d1x5jk2,26,t5_2rmjc
