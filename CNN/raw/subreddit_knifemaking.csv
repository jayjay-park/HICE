5263088,1,t1_cvk2cg2,The ideal hardness for a throwing starknife is  to  RC.  The ideal steel for a throwing starknife is mediumcarbon steel.  It is likely that any given circular saw blade body fits into these requirements.  What you call a crappy steel body is often a very nice steel such as  or .It is unlikely that abrasive cutting of the saw blade would result in a significant loss of hardness.  Because the RC is lower than a typical cutting knife it would take a higher temperature to affect the temper.  In other words if you have a piece of saw blade that is  RC you would have to heat beyond F to ruin the temper.   is really quite hot  beyond blue beyond purple  hot enough to make welding gloves smolder when the steel is handled.If there was a loss of hardness it would be localized to the area adjacent to the cut.  On a cutting knife this would spell disaster since the edge must be hard.  On a throwing knifestar however this would not affect performance significantly.Yes  will buy a . x  piece of steel.

If your line does become washed out if you draw file or sand  flat parallel to the tang the line will come right back so long as your sandpaper is flat as well.   Dont use a soft backer for your paper until youre at the very highest grits and just working on your finish.Dont think the grinder is going to save you all that much time youll likely throw out a few blanks before you get the hang of it and youll benefit from touching it up with the file jig anyway if youre doing a flat grind.Congrats on your first knife!,knifemaking,d6t872t,2,t5_2to7v

They work really well for foundry work with a crucible and they do get hot enough for forging but unless you are forging really small pieces itll leave you wanting more.  That being said they work really well and just with good ol matchlight you can really get some heat from it.  Also mine is made from the same metal planter.  After running it for four plus hours at a time I can tell you that none of that zinc coating burns off and even if it did chances are youre using it outside and have plenty of ventilation.
