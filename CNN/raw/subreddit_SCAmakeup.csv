2569358,0,t3_2oe6fh,Ive been using tretinoin . for awhile now and I actually never encountered the dryness problem. My derm had me use cetaphil the one in the tub and I think that must have really helped combat any of the dryness that would have happened if I was to use something else!,SCAmakeup,cmtybnn,1,t5_359aa
