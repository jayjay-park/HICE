677534,0,t3_2100el,if you like game of thrones there fat pink cast it a feminist podcast and they start off with discussing each ep of season  as it airs then expand their topics for the off season. there are a few episoded dedicated to talking about parentsfathers and princessons. i really like it and they call out the shows and the books problematic stuff. but you basically have to have read the whole series theyre full of spoilers.,SRSMen,cghaaz4,1,t5_2tjl0
1207317,0,t1_ci5dvt7,Well I suppose you deserve some credit for attempting to distract the issue good job!Womanesia is a severe plague that is spreading across Australia. Luckily AampE have the cure a series which teaches women how to be women. The programs involve women doing womanly things such as cooking and cleaning and being submissive.Would you say that is not sexist?,SRSMen,ci5fwnu,1,t5_2tjl0
1269421,0,t1_cicbd0p,You should know that it remains an open question in feminist theory as to whether the aim is to erase differences between the sexes or to elevate femalefeminine attributesvalues as still different but equal.The good news is that while that gets sorted out there are plenty of clear injustices that everyone whether they call themselves feminists or allies or just decent human beings can work on together.,SRSMen,cicfd3e,5,t5_2tjl0
1494684,0,t3_2baxub,I feel ya. Heres what I tell myself to maintain some perspective there are a lot of blogs articles posts and websites that do round up white and male as the enemy but the internet is not real life. Theyre writing to make a point pick up a solution start a discussion or find an answer and mentioning all the decent human males is often besides the point except when showing theyre still capable of moments of implicit sexism. You have to let it be a mutual understanding that everyone recognizes there are a lot of decent men out there. Our gender is not the enemy. The culture our gender breeds us into however is. Id say its impossible to separate the two and it makes sense that its not so clear when youve been reading so much.Its entirely understandable you have a growing prejudice against your own ingroup but for the sake of everyone especially yourself you have to let that shit go. It will drive you crazy. It will make you hurt. That pain can become enough to make your investment in feminism dubious masochistic or even nonexistant. Remind yourself of your very best feminist friends. Remind yourself how they treat your problems and how willing they are to believe you and empathize with you. Remind yourself of their coolheaded confrontations with aggressors or willingness to get to know someone past a very clear layer of misogyny. Remind yourself of the implicit faith they have in you. Are those the actions of people who believe men are the enemy? No. And are those people the same ones writing the highlights of societys horrors? Sometimes yes. Youre doing exactly what you shouldnt do when the conversation is a criticism of privilege  but also what the human mind does so quickly and effortlessly  youre taking it personally. If you wanna be the ally that I assume you do you gotta realize that this self.post was making their problems about you. And thats just wrong. That being said Ive done worse and thought worse than you just posted. I even have some rather sinister criticisms of feminism that will never see the light of day. My thinking is scattered across the fucking states and my beliefs waver with a light breeze. But my actions do not. And thats the important part.,SRSMen,cj3mtet,11,t5_2tjl0
1516320,0,t3_20ii61,There is an evil sadistic side to me that would like to follow the person who makes this argument around and constantly talk about how much I hope their parents andor children die painfully. See how long they stay aloof.,SRSMen,cj6cih8,1,t5_2tjl0

1884237,0,t1_ckg83jn,Oh i see. Yeah i guess.I read a magazine article about bianca and nick bowser. A married couples who are both transgender. Quiet interesting them having children mom empregnating dad with dad carrying till birth. Quiet a surreal read. Thank you so much for you empathy. Yes it can be quiet painful to have both men and women members of your own community buy into the idea that my genital size makes me more or less worthy as a man and a lover.But everyone here has been so support and you have my deeply felt gratitude for that.,SRSMen,ckg8r31,4,t5_2tjl0

2719286,0,t1_cnd40nk,The th option thinking doesnt come from the Rebecca Watson story and other stories like that themselves but from the reactions to it. When you read through the social media comments one person will say to never approach her in a club or a bar other will say to never approach her in a library another one says to never approach her after class and so on. Some will take it even further and say to never approach unless she approaches you first. An empathetic person will never want to make another person uncomfortable and how do you know which woman prefers which approach? The safest and best way for everyone is to never approach anyone at all.,SRSMen,cnd669u,7,t5_2tjl0

2844948,0,t3_2sl6tb,gtSo Id invite you rSRSMen  to go back through your own history  have you always been the sort of person whod post to SRSMen? Have you even always been a feminist? Are there certain things you regret saying but understand why you said them at the time?Certainly not.  years ago Id probably have been featured on Prime for buying into straw feminist arguments. My mother is a feminist and Ive been brought up with ideals of equality decency and justice from a feminist perspective. But she hasnt been any sort of activist or openly described herself as feminists before others largely sick of having such debates with people that arent likeminded. So it was easy for me to think I wasnt sexist or part of a greater problem since I generally have been a compassionate person at heart while feeling utterly disenfranchised myself. But then I started digging deeper and found that many feminists in fact do care about men and are part of most stories that draw attention to problems men face. I basically started to reconnect to my roots. The examination of said roots helped me to realize that I felt disenfranchised because I have a social anxiety disorder. And strangely the more I understand that Ive actually been disenfranchised not by feminism but neurotypical privilege and toxic masculinityheteronormativity. There are things would regret having said and even more things I would wish I had said but Ive always had a great deal of acceptance for the past. Regret only increases my anxiety so regret isnt for me. ,SRSMen,cnrgwzg,2,t5_2tjl0
3306956,0,t1_cp57hro,I think the problem is how the internet santizes everything. Every day we hear about how so many children were killed in syria so many people were forced to be raped in Saudi Arabia this day or that day. It just feels unreal and inauthentic  look at the way chan a site full of normal people for the most part has deliberately attacked epilepsy sufferers. The only way you can possibly comprehend websites like tumblr is through escapism.,SRSMen,cp57wzv,-4,t5_2tjl0

3529422,0,t1_cpukr16,gtNo but not all mens are like that talk.gtWomen and anyone else who doesnt identify as a man are super duper welcome!Well according to the last two rules on this subreddit it doesnt look like they take too kindly to men here.,SRSMen,cpuktnh,-10,t5_2tjl0

4517579,0,t1_ct0140j,Well Im certainly not trying to say this shit doesnt happen. As Ive said it happenedhappens to me. Im just saying that I think this particular issue is often exaggerated it seems as a way to refocus men because so little attention is paid to us. sI also think its important to remember again that fields where emotional expression is paramount literature theatre music are also dominated by men. So we need to question this truism that men are not allowed to be expressive.,SRSMen,ct031wy,2,t5_2tjl0

5256792,0,t1_cvj8u57,Hmm fair enough.  We clearly received very different messages from that article but I can see how you came by your interpretation.  Im not telling you to accept being a social outcast and to find your purpose in life.  Im trying to say that it doesnt need to be that way.  I think you will probably have sex and if youre socially isolated its entirely possible for that to change.  ,SRSMen,cvjmqrg,2,t5_2tjl0
6000709,0,t1_cy650j0,gt by making jokes or generally mocking shorter penises youre reinforcing a hypermasculine phallocentric culture in which mens worth is valued by penis size or height. Did I mocked small penises? Quote me because I dont recall doing that. I have said I mock short guys about it but only after I find they are misogynistic.gt Unsurprisingly some men without these attributes have selfconfidence issues and problems with their own masculinity.Wow mental problems due to objectification! I wonder how that must feel like...,SRSMen,cy681z7,-5,t5_2tjl0
