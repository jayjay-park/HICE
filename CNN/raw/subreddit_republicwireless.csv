859501,0,t3_23z15y,I was actually considering the tmobile  dollar plan before a friend of mine had me give republic a try.  Ive been using t since January with the Moto X.  I order  moto Gs last week so I can get the rest of my lines moved off verizon.  Im actually thinking about moving to the  dollar plan and using an offline GPS app as Im not really sure how much I need mobile data still.  So far I havent had any issues with coverage granted Sprints g data speeds arnt great but they work for streaming podcasts and using google maps.Republic wireless uses a modified version of Android and is locked to a certain part of Sprints cell spectrum so you would have to use the Moto G that you get from Republic and not the Google Play version.So far as traveling goes I havent had any issues yet but you do have limited roaming on Verizon if there is no sprint signal.  I think you are limited to mb of data on roaming.  I dont think there are any calling limitations but I could be wrong on that.  I think with the  day money back policy its at least worth a try.

Another note that may not be something at the front of your mind is that the Nexus phones are both unlocked so there isnt any bloatware on the main OS other than the base google packages like Play Contacts Photos etc. This means that the GB or GB stretches further than it did on my GB MotoX. I have a X and spoke mostly for that but the P doesnt look bad by any means. To me it felt like near phablet status size wise. Some upsides are that the P has an aluminum construction over the X plastic as well as higher total capacity at GB if youre into that. Both are good phones it kind of comes to style and price range in my opinon.I should also clarify that my calling issues also included the chop in chop out over wifi but diverting to cell signal for calling was not an option at my home spotty reception.,republicwireless,czp91h2,1,t5_2t2sb
