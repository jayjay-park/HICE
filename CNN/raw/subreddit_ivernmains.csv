9042934,0,t1_d7ysxl1,Also the hp and mana cost increases while junglers like nidalee and elise dont take damage for taking full camps lol,ivernmains,d7ytdwe,2,t5_3gb2o
9071976,0,t3_54g1r4,Id go this for jungle gtmagic pen markshas no ad ratios  flat armor scaling HP whatever team hes fighting will help more with  scaling CDR   flat MR  movespeed quintsthis will help him escape people easier in jungle early and when being chased especially in invade scenarios since ap wont help your clear early and probably wont amount to much early few levels damage wise anyway,ivernmains,d82ayz4,2,t5_3gb2o

9581815,0,t1_d9ttf9f,Now Id have to say that the fearless mastery would depend on your playstyle. I dont play Ivern tanky as my build is rather heavily inspired by ChaosRains playstyle as i saw his post tried it out for myself and encountered heavy success using it. As such the  armour wouldnt do much for me since my build is usually Ionian Boots gt Dark Seal gt Athenes gt Mejais gt GA gt Runic Echoes gt RylaisProtobelt,ivernmains,d9u5kgd,1,t5_3gb2o

9686425,0,t3_5d9er7,Happens very often to me I dont announce him anymore. But in my case its probably because I main him on toplane..,ivernmains,da722h2,1,t5_3gb2o
9979117,0,t3_5ii0z8,Its really clutch for denying vision on objectives.  I use it to hide baron and dragon hp.  I also like to make an area on the tower so the enemy has to guess to land skillshots.  Its saved me a couple times when Im being chased by just placing it between me and the enemy so they cant aa me or see my defensive q coming.,ivernmains,db8b2ms,5,t5_3gb2o

10310127,0,t1_dcbkglt,It really does. Feels worse that he told the club I raged him wheNI actually added him as a friend afterwards. He finally accepted my friend request but he wont say a word to me after several messages. Wish there was something I could do. I was very active and it was a very full club.,ivernmains,dccpj0o,5,t5_3gb2o
10393401,0,t3_569qgh,I find it hard to get a S or higher on ivern lately i been playing him and i won a ranked game and went  and got a A and before that i won and went  and i got a A both games i would do damage to towers k plus gold and idk we ended not to late game and still i feel its broken,ivernmains,dcm5pif,1,t5_3gb2o
10574759,0,t1_dd6o8q2,yeah its stated in the passive that he can NOT be attacked by jungle monsters,ivernmains,dd6pc8z,1,t5_3gb2o
10580916,0,t3_5rhmhk,Ivern is good against champions that have difficulty engaging like Udyr Nasus Volibear etc. However his q will let these same champs gap close instantly giving them great synergy with him. His ranged stun and Daisy can keep them at arms length. He is also good with teams that have supports that cant peel very well or if you decide to take a mage as support as you can transition to the support role yourself in teamfights. Caitlyn Nidalee and Rengar all benefit from his extra bushes which can be good or bad depending on if they are on your team or the enemys. Ivern is generally a very safe pick like Elise or Lee. I rarely ever feel unsafe picking him before the other jungler. ,ivernmains,dd7c8oz,2,t5_3gb2o
10766021,0,t3_5tllv2,Im in silver and this happens to me all the time along with teammates not knowing about the buff copies Woah thats super cool! What is that champ?. But honestly the slight inconveniences that come with my teammates not knowing much about Ivern are outweighed by the benefits that come with my opponents not knowing much about him  usually how much they underestimate him like an underleveled Xin Zhao thinking he can v Daisy. Good times.,ivernmains,ddqfohi,3,t5_3gb2o

11547725,0,t3_64tdkl,Are you sure this site is correct? Surrender at  is showing the brushmaker range and movespeed nerfs as being reverted.If these initial PBE nerfs are reverted Im guessing its to either put the other nerfs up or to just hold back on them and see how Ivern stands after all the new broken tank items are released next patch may cause a shift that makes Ivern not as strong.,ivernmains,dg4xqzq,1,t5_3gb2o
