129208,0,t1_cet4m08,No worries.When I was in college I developed panic disorder and depression pretty bad.  My PCP sent me to a psychiatrist who put me on Wellbutrin XL and Klonopin.  I was on those two drugs for about a year and a half while visiting my psych once a month.  At no point did he offer any alternatives beyond tweaking my dosages.  At some point I realized there was no plan to get me off of these drugs.  It was like as long as the symptoms were managed his job was done.  Meanwhile I was developing some serious digestive issues as a result of longterm Klonopin use.I started looking into ways I could handle my depression and anxiety on my own.  I started doing light therapy daily exercising a minute guided meditation thing and researching herbs which acted as nervines.  Six months later I was off all my drugs and never went back to that doc.I began premed so I could be a psych and help people like myself but then I found naturopathic medicine which seemed to fit my ideas about medicine better. I dont know what you know about naturopathic curriculum but I have all the same basic science courses a normal med student would have.  For instance right now Im in Pathology III taught by an MD Clinical Physical Diagnosis CPD lab Lab Diagnosis Lab Diagnosis Lab and others.  In addition to those Ive also started my Botanical Medicine series and Im taking an elective called Integrative Phytology where we are learning the biochemistry of phytochemicals and how they work in the body.  Ill start clinic rotations next term where Ill be working in a community clinic with a PCP and will be in clinic throughout my six years in school.  Is there still pseudoscience in the curriculum?  Yes but its changing as more and more states begin in license NDs.  I would say that over half of my freshman class came from Science backgrounds in addition to the regular premed classes we all took which is so much different than it was even  years ago.  I understand its more fun to have a blackandwhite enemy but the profession is much more nuanced than most MDs would believe.  As an ND in Oregon Ill have the full prescribing rights as an MD but will have the training in herbs which I really enjoy and Ill know a lot about supplements which is knowledge I can use to educate patients who think everything that comes in a bottle with the word natural is good for them.,medicine,cet58xv,20,t5_2qhff

163754,0,t1_cewuzph,All the issues you speak of are for patients that still have a life to sustain and yes in those cases the law would apply. But this is not one of those cases.As far as I know the laws regarding this situation specifically only say that lifesustaining treatment cannot be withdrawn. And another law states that one way for a patient to be officially dead is if all spontaneous brain and brain stem functions cease as is the case here.Since the law defines her as being dead and therefore not alive there is no life to sustain. So whatever the hospital is doing to her body it isnt lifesustaining treatment right?Thats where the interpretation part comes in.Family says you cant sustain the life of a dead patient. Hospital says you can.If the procedures arent lifesustaining treatment then the law requiring continuance lifesustaining treatment doesnt apply to this case and the hospital is committing some serious ethical violations.My two cents the family is right.

247903,0,t1_cf6b2bn,Ugh more theorycrafting. Im not trying to disparage you here but Ive had this discussion a thousand times so pardon my brash tone.gt You might solve a problem and have an opportunity to learn from that experience but if you dont get good rest afterwords youll lose allmost of that. This has been demonstrated for both knowledge skills and motor skills. Please show me the studies claiming this. Im not disagreeing Id just like to see the basis for these claims.gt I think your evidence about people at the top of their field working a lot is both anecdotal and a cause of correlation rather than causation.Really difficult to prove causation for this stuff due to the many disparate variables but I tend to look to what extremely successful people are doing and emulate this behavior and its served me well. I dont believe success is a function of passion rather experience and hard work. Read Carol Dweck.gt When planning a project you manage scope time and manpower to get to an attainable goal. If you find yourself at a deadline and youre not done you either need to change your scope or timing.I had a feeling you would respond with this and as someone whos studied project management for about  years I understand that response. However project management from a theoretical perspective is quite different than reality. Its hard to include disasters and other major problems in the scope and its very common for insurance to fall short especially due to their negative incentives to honor all claims. My most recent example is Hurricane Sandy. You can say oh well thats a freak disaster you cant do anything about that but we still had to get our affected hospitals operational because they were hemorrhaging money w outpatient services shutdown. So theres a real life example of a deadline that is literally as soon as possible and there are many others especially in public infrastructure defense and health care.gt More than a century of studies show that longterm useful worker output is maximized near a fiveday hour workweek. Productivity drops immediately upon starting overtime and continues to drop until at approximately eight hour weeks the total work done is the same as what would have been done in eight hour weeks.Its important to define our terms here. Productivity in the traditional economic definition is outputcost. The colloquial definition of productivity that most people talk about is outputtime. Most of these studies on productivity were during the scientific management age with Frederick Winslow Taylor and the stuff that Henry Ford did. Overtime for hourly workers plays a major role. If it wasnt for the FLSA a lot of these oftcited studies would have incredibly different results. When you are talking about salaried knowledge workers it becomes much harder to measure productivity across an organization. Its still possible to measure outputcost in aggregate. Outputtime though is basically impossible. If you can find any definitive studies on this please let me know. Ive looked for years and only come up with junk. I did only skim that article briefly because it didnt cite a lot of sources and I prefer to read the sources.gt In the short term working over  hours continuously is equivalent to being legally drunk.OK now this just isnt true. You can argue motor impairment and effects on decision making but this has nothing to do with the legal equivalence of being drunk and I think if you thought about this youd realize how absurd it sounds. Youre not going to lose your job or get a DUI for driving when being awake a long time. They may have some similar effects but they are not legally equivalent.Plus I quite often have a either amphetamine or modafinil or both in my system once Im up for a long time. How does that factor into your claims of diminished cognitive ability? It certainly changes the equation.Finally how do you measure the increased productivity someone might exhibit due to being promoted due to the view justified or not that they work harder than everyone else? Also exposure to opportunities is something thats difficult to quantify thats an obvious advantage to someone doing more work be it exposure to unique learning opportunities or chances to land new business or meet important people or whatever. Many jobs arent linear with respect to output and I think thats the fundamental problem with most of these productivity studies. If I work twice as many hours as you but Im exposed to certain people and situations twice as much as you and those are the real boosts to knowledgeproductivity theres nothing you can do about that Im going to win.

358448,0,t1_cfhsvui,I would also disagree here. PTSD is basically defined as the inability to habituate to and attenuate a stress response. Through a pathological mechanism the sympathetic nervous system is hyper activated in response to exposure to the trigger or stimulus. The sympathetic nervous system is activated and the feedback from such activation is then interpreted by the brain as panic or elevated stress. It is the lack of habituation to the stimulus that is postulated to be the underlying pathology here. This view is THE PREDOMINANT one held by such thought leaders such and Rachael Yehuda and Barbara Rothbaum as well as Kerry Ressler.  Alternatively and to maintain a hypothesis driven fidelity to research one could hypothesize that lack of habituation or attenuation of an emotional stressor could result in the hyper or hypo activation of pathways that cause PHYSICAL neurological deficits  ie conversion syndrome. The corollary to that hypothesis is that PTSD and conversion syndrome exist within the same genus of disorders being that PTSD results from out of whack sympathetic function and conversion syndrome results from aberrant corticospinal or pyramidal system dysfunction. Thus PTSD is a different species of manifestation than conversion but the same basic element is present in both an emotional trauma or stressor causes circuits to have aberrant input output and depending on where and when this occurs the final result is either PTSD or conversion.  This hypothesis provides numerous predictions to be tested from retrospective and prospective studies and in the same elegant yet simple assessment of VS Ramadhandrans mirror box for phantom limb pain potential avenues of therapy. TLDR though I disagree a hypothesis to be tested is that PTSD is the lack of habituation to a stressor that results in EMOTIONAL symptoms and conversion syndrome is the lack of habituation to a stressor that results in PHYSICAL symptoms. Numerous predictions can be tested in retrospective and prospective studies.  ,medicine,cfhx3sb,1,t5_2qhff

But saying people who become midlevel practitioners are playing doctor and doing it from some sort of simplistic money vs training calculation smacks of arrogance.

If you are not affiliated with these religions might the practice of yoga be not as relevant? It seems that here in the US yoga is a relaxing stretching exercise modality not a spiritual process. I prefer that such studies do not call it yoga unless they make it very clear what the spiritual practices accompany the stretching are.  A wonderful resource for patients are the Stretching books by the Andersons.   There is zero spiritual stuff attached to these stretchingexercise guides. I think you must be very careful when selecting a stretchingrelaxation program with religious associations.

You also must understand that a doc can call psychiatry get the run around that it might be this or that medical condition told to get a CT scan etc then when psyche finally sees him or her there arent beds in acute psychiatric care and the patient sits in the ER for sometimes a full day with a guard watching for a room to open up.  Do you think psychiatry was swinging by every few hours to check on the patient? Not a chance. They wait for transfer. Ive had a suicidal woman sit in an ER hallway in paper scrubs for  hours before she was moved to the psyche unit. As for my attitude it pertains to that and not necessarily the patients themselves.

I gathered that you were having a breakdown so thats why I advised you to just delete things. And walking away is always good too  getting further involved is just going to further the breakdown. People here are snarky sometimes always?. Not everyone here is a medical professional. Even then people in positions like yours are always frustrating to medical professionals. Doctors dont always handle this well in real life as youve found out  doctors are human too and even when they do its often a big source of stress for us. It is easy to be unprofessional and vent some of that stress directly at you when we are all anonymous people on the internet. Why are people in situations like yourself frustrating? Lots of reasons. Chronic pain is incredibly difficult to treat and doctors dont like not being able to help patients. On top of that many will be worried that you are a drug seeker. On top of that chronic pain is associated with certain personality traits which came first is often a good question but many patients with chronic pain have borderline or dependent personality traits which often really gets under the skin of other people not even on purpose look up counter transference and makes them act emotionally back. On top of that people dont always want the version of events thats medically most likely  they dont like hearing that mental health plays a role in pain or that somatoform disorder is a real thing as they interpret that as the doctor telling them its all in their head though this is maybe because they arent good at explaining pain. As a result you get a conflict between what your medical opinion is and what the patients opinion is which is awkward  people dont like conflict. I still think that you might find something like supportive counselling useful. Even if not to cognitively deal with whats happened to you to at least support you through dealing with this shit and through the low points. ,medicine,ch3239l,7,t5_2qhff

Needle decompression because of decreased breath sounds. Ive seen and repaired a ventricular injury in a patient who was needle decompressed into his heart. Theres decent evidence it has high potential morbidity.In my paramedic class we only went over the textbook of decompressing and needle crics we never actually tested on the skill and I didnt get to try it hands on until I looked into it myself after the class had ended.

Coordinated care goes from being a pieinthesky dream under paper records to observable trackable reality under EMR  as just one of many healthcare benefits for Americans.

I got whooping cough as an infant was vaccinated guess it didnt take or it might have been something else medical records from then arent exactly perfect probably part of what caused the TD in terms of environmental factors also had Vitamin D deficiency despite my mom taking prenatal vitamins... which surprise surprise only have IU of D. Lost  pounds in the span of a week my parents took me to an idiot walkin family doc halfway through the week and he dismissed it as a cold despite the polyuria and polydipsia. Got taken to an emerg and the nurse immediately knew I had it.In Canada the meds werent super expensive particularly cuz my family does alright for themselves but it still probably would have been financially crippling for someone that was just making ends meet before hand. There isnt enough awareness for things like benefits programs for people who cant afford their medications one of my buddies is a more recently diagnosed T and I had to find shit for him cuz hed never heard of it. This is in Canadia too I imagine it cant be any better in the US.Doctors visits are covered and I saw a terrible endo every  months in addition to my absolute amazing pediatrician every few months as well. It was  so this was before Lantus was out so I got stuck in the ass by my mom several times a day with NPH  regular to cover my meals with generally poor control of my blood sugars because of a shitty endo and shitty diabetes counseling for my parents. When I got a little bit older I entered a trial for ultralente ended up in a hypoglycemic coma around  because again shitty endocrinologist didnt properly explain the difference between ultralente and NPH to my parents.Got a different endo after that things started improving. My new pediatric endo is a wonderful lady. With her my care really improved and so did all my patient outcomes. My Ac went from high slow s to low s. Puberty came and it messed up my sugars again plus I was a teenager and found it hard to give a shit about anything.People with chronic illnesses are known to commonly suffer from burn out but its something thats rarely ever discussed. Diabetes Burnout has been documented though.I got the pump which helped control my sugars a bit more but I eventually stopped wearing it for a number of reasons. While a new technology may seem great in theory and even practice sometimes the detriments can outweigh the benefits for certain patients. I know not to push things on people for that reason even if it would make my  their lives potentially easier to deal with. Complications include permanent lipohypertrophy  scarring on the side of my abdomen fat deposits that wont go away even when Im  body fat constantly ripping out the god damn infusion sites sleeping funny leaksocclusions your blood sugar spikes up HEAVY if something goes wrong cuz no lantus. A much better way is to go untethered  of your basal as a single daily lantus injection and customize with the pump using apidrahumalog so if you do go periods of time not wearing the pump you wont get crushed.During periods of stressillness my blood sugar will go up both because of the physical problem and because my care somewhat goes to shit. For what its worth I dont seem to get sick that often.I also know retinoatphy  nephropathy are eventualities for me cuz Ive already had the disease for  years. Not too worried. Hopefully someone will come out with a combined therapy of amylin  insulin  cpeptide which should ameliorate a lot of those risks today you learned cpeptide actually has a function in the human body and so does amylin your betacells dont just make them for nothing. Annual optometrist visits are also a regular occurrence I see a lot of docturds.I dont really have a passion to be an endocrinologist MS right now but I guess well have to see what happens.Oh I also have Graves got it when I was  my second pediatric endo is a wizard because she caught it despite my only visible symptom being hand tremors and not weight gain over  months with an increase in height of  inch... I even had bradycardia from xc and most people would have just assumed my excessive eatingsweating was because of xc too  miles a week of actual running will do that to you. That was a year course of methimazole and now I get my TSH checked every endo visit my adult endo isnt great hes old and old docs usually not the greatest at keeping up with new research. I wanted methimazole because I preferred once a day dosing to two.I also have asthma atopic as fuck heh minor scoliosis less than  degrees and Im thinking Ill probably end up developing Celiacs some time in my life time yay! Dont eat that much wheat anyway a lot of my carbs come from potatoesoats if I can manage it.TLDR   Diabetes burnout is real. Its a physical condition with mental ramifications. Ive found a lot of Type s are pretty laid backeasy going people because of it we eventually stop giving a shit about the little things sometimes to our own detriment.Medical side For anyone who deals with type  diabetics on pump therapy for their sake look up the untethered regimen.   In the US prescribing patients with fragilepoorly controlled Type  diabetes symlinpramlintidean amylin analog would also probably be greatly beneficial.  Eagerly awaiting combined insulin amylin cpeptide injectable therapy. Should be cool.  Looking forward to retinopathy nephropathy neuropathy and possibly Celiacs. For diabetic complications Im taking Carnitine  Taurine MDs are often dismissive of things they know nothing about without knowing the research and are great at misquoting Tim Minchin but theres actual human evidence of both of those being beneficial for Type  Diabetics and both being deficient in Ts too.Also Im guessing its a CTLA gene polymorphism my sister had really bad asthma as a kid and we all get seasonal allergies taking Spirulina helps a shit ton for all of us with that again real evidence for that helping and a shit ton of anecdotal evidence from others.

2104285,0,t1_cl72x1t, We already do let all sorts of organizations make choices on resource optimization rather than merit. We even tend to dress it up as meritocracy. Its called scholarships.Scholarships are schools saying youre smarter you can have a lower energy of activation for attendance or conversely youre a dumbass  if were going to let you in youre going to have to pay more. Theyre a dumb tax.So why isnt that bribery? If you paid an admissions counselor to get you in  that is if stole the schools decision making power for himself by using it according to his protocols rather than theirs  that would be bribery. But if the admissions counselor was told by the school itself we want to take this person in for reason X well the school is an organization that has the right to choose who enters it. I dont know if the contract explicitly works out as favoring people by country of origin. Considering that I know people who have walked out of Carrib schools with  step s and still had trouble getting residency spots I have a very strong suspicion that this may simply work out as offsetting some of the bias that crowds out carribs that would  if theyd come from a continental program  have gotten a match. I do think that I dont really give a shit theres so much about every single step of becoming a doctor thats so much more corrupt than this  and worse because its more subtle  that this doesnt really tickle my nuts. Youre confusing nonprofit with public. Nonprofit is a state andor federal designation depending on whether you file for both that simply states a hospitals ownership will not extract excess revenues over profits  from the organization and keep it for themselves. I can run a nonprofit deli if I wanted to so long as I met the handful of criteria the government sets. Theyre granted taxexempt status because those handful of criteria are generally for the public goodtype missions and the government sees fit to allow these organizations to essentially self tax where tax  taking money and reallocating it for the public good if you follow their rules you can take what would have been your tax money and put it directly to the use of public good. This doesnt turn you into an organization no longer required to be financially solvent or run by someone elses coffers  it just means you skip out on some tax payments. I have no idea what you think these hospitals should ignore financial incentives on anything just because theyre nonprofits their nonprofit relationship isnt one of general selfsacrifice it just means were performing a public service and in exchange we dont pay taxes and our owners dont get to pocket the cash afterward.The contract in question regards public hospitals which is to say hospitals owned by the state. Theyre probably nonprofit but thats not guaranteed depending on how the state wants to extract its portion of revenues and how the hospitals accountants want to structure its finances to favor continued solvency. I think the argument of stateowned hospitals should not be responding to foreign government incentive programs might hold a little more water but thats where its worth pointing out that the contract is with a foreign med school not a foreign government. As long as they meet program requirements for board scores I guess I dont care where they come from.,medicine,cl7atdv,1,t5_2qhff

2167006,0,t1_cleqimi,From what I have gathered in the last year or so working in an Ortho firm respect money and power... so the usual feuds in medicine.Most DPMs are nonsurgical and their role is quite clear.  However after the initial  years podiatry school some DPMs will go on to a surgical residency that allows them to correct fractures soft tissue injuries deformities etc.  Most DPMs are legally prohibited from doing anything above the tibial tuberosity but depending on the MDs in the practice they work at they may be prevented from doing even that as well.Foot and ankle orthopedics is not a very common specialty so most MD surgeons you see working in it are very specialized and extensively trained.  They take issue when they see someone who either has less experience podiatry is a newly recognized field or less training usually does not entail as much surgical training or fellowships competing with them.  DPMs also tend to do lots of and different procedures that dont always match up with MD procedures.  Depending on who you work for MD or DPM you will think either of the two parties is the main cause of the dispute usually.In my personal experience I have worked with good surgical DPMs and bad ones.  At our firm one of the two DPMs there left willingly and the other was asked to leave suddenly fired.  I would consider them to be shady providers as they often performed up to  procedures at once and often recommended surgery where not required.  There was a lot of tension because my boss an MD footankle surgeon was new to the practice but had more experience and as a result tried to curtail their questionable practices which led to a huge pissingmatch and the eventual decimation of our footankle department.  By contrast I also trained in staff for a DPM at a Mayo clinic.  The guy was a solid practitioner who remained entirely in his own boundaries and was very conservative with surgery.Fun stuff.,medicine,clf9zbw,1,t5_2qhff

2179312,0,t1_clgrmm1,no doubt the majority are predatory however a lot of people do make it through if not the first year then the next year.  And I pretty much did well up until third year going into fourth year.  The problem isnt just these schools its also the testing system as you already alluded to with standardized testing.  Unfortunately that is the name of the game and you can still be a crap doctor if you pass every one of them on the first try.  And as a result of all this you end up studying for medicine and then studying for boards and studying for boards is a huge cashcow never mind having ridiculous exams like the CS.  For that response you can turn to a NEJM article about  months ago talking about its relevancy in the realm testing.Additionally Ive completed all the steps and the rd one on the first try only four months after passing step ck.  Passing step  signifies that youre able to practice unsupervised.  Yet that doesnt seem good enough and were frequently surpassed by nurses and nurse practitioners in respect to practice.  Allinall it would be in the best interest of the AMA and the NBME to offer solutions to this dilemma so that we dont end up stuck and so we can better utilize the background we have.  Otherwise its just a taxpayer dump.

2937028,0,t3_2ts0my,I adore the clinical pharmD in my outpatient family med office. We have a very collaborative relationship. The most common thing he does is phone management of our diabetics taking their logs remotely and titrating insulin without making them come in for a visit. He does similar things for hypertension or CHF management for our patients who have home monitors or do daily weights. I might see them  times a year but he checks in with some of them up to every  weeks. We also have some covisits. He will see the patient first do med reconciliation do similar DM or HTN management and queue up my prescriptions so all I have to do is sign them after I see the patient if I agree. It frees me up to take care of their complex issues. Just last week he saw one of my complicated diabetics increased their insulin and increased their anti hypertensives and I had time to then fully evaluate their dyspnea order a CHF work up treat their COPD exacerbation initiate home care orders and actually talk to my patient without rushing them through rudely. If Id been by myself that day I would have either taken twice as long with the patient and run half an hour behind or just not managed to address the diabetes and HTN since the dyspnea took priority.

3062703,0,t3_2v74ru,Im a US citizen and graduate in the US Navy.  Im currently doing my GMO tour and then plan to do either EM or something surgical.  My wife is British and I agreed to move to the UK upon retiring from the Navy in another decade or so.  I just passed the PLAB  last month and will probably register with the GMC prior to returning to residency.  Ive been looking at all this since the beginning of medical school and have recently consulted with Stewart Duffy at RadcliffesLe Brasseur a solicitor.  I know I am not the first American he has worked with to obtain registration.  My understanding is that generally getting the GMC to recognize US specialty training isnt that difficult.  One must prove to the GMC that your training is equivalent.  For something like GI it is probably pretty straightforward.  For some specialties they dont transfer well because of how the profession has split up over the year.  E.g. a rad onc would have a hard time going to the UK because rad and chem onc are one specialty.  The hard part is going to be finding a consultant job.  For something like EM there is a significant shortage so being foreign wont hurt you.  For something like ortho it may be much harder particularly if you want the desirable southeast.  If I were to do anything surgical I would plan to do a fellowship upon moving to the UK in order to build contacts.  This would be after a number of years practicing as an attending without having done a fellowship in the UK.  ,medicine,cofg2ml,3,t5_2qhff

3232331,0,t1_cox0dqj,when you say Cl I want to make it clear that the scope of the question is only limited to the renal clearance ratio and not serum concentration serum concentration is much more complex than that question. So what happens is. If you find a lot of Na in someones urine high clearance ratio of Na you should find low K in that urine. hence the inversely related part. Now if you have high Na in urine you will also have high Cl much of its regulation is following cations but if you have high K in urine you should also have high Cl because when Cl is moving with electrochemical gradient through a channel it doesnt recognize the cation it follows is K or Na it just knows its positive. Now back to your question since the ratio between Na and K is often one high one low what will Cl do? Since Cl follows both it will often stay relatively stable because the overall cation output balances out. now practically speaking Cl is influenced by Na way more because theres more of it. Therefore the outcome of high K might actually be low cl due to lower Na but thats not a direct effect. ,medicine,cox1bzz,1,t5_2qhff

3394796,0,t3_2z2o2s,Youre right to a certain extent but I think youre descriptions are the stereotypical cynical view of people that complain about the fields.There are lots of primary care physicians that enjoy their jobs and same with internal medicine and pediatrics. In family medicine its possible to make lots of money and in internal medicine its possible to not let it take over your life. Its just that on average family medicine will make a more modest wage than other specialties and internal medicine CAN be more timeconsuming. However its really about your desires and goals in life. To be fair the  thousand dollars a family doctor can make are about  times the national average wage so to say that they are making very little is a very relative statement. And the truth is that the nice  wage can actually be enjoyed because youre likely to be working from  and able to spend it traveling with family doing projects whatever else you like. Is it better to make k a year as an orthopedic surgeon with no time to spend it or k in family medicine with lots of time to spend it? On the other hand in any field you can basically make as much money as you want to make. I know family doctors that have a private practice only take care of patients that they want practice in a semirural setting where the city isnt too far of a drive away and dont take insurance cashonly and they make cash money. I know an internal medicine doc that works the evening shift works like pmam  days a week and makes pretty good money but never feels overworked or tired or exhausted. He makes great money and feels like he has a great lifestyle. Of course if he wanted he could work all day and all night and make much more but hes happy where he is  he has a great family great house sweet cars retirement fund started and loans paid off. In pediatrics sure it is similar to medicine but gets paid less but its not solely because of politics. I was under the impression that a lot of it was the fact that theres less things to bill for. Like you wouldnt give children colonoscopies or prostate exams or diagnose them with high paying things. A lot of it is vaccinations flu season stuff and some cool cases. Dont go into pediatrics because you like the personality kids go into pediatrics because you like the medical science of kids. You dont have time to hang out with kids and youll be dealing with the parents for the most part. If you love thinking about medicine and account for the extraordinary specialness of kids then thats why you should go into pediatrics.TLDR  Any field will pay you way above the national average wage and most of the stuff you see on the internet are complaints which are partly true and partly overemphasized. It is possible to do anything you want in any field you want barring something like wanting to work  day a week in neurosurgery or make  million a year in family medicine. ,medicine,cpf8f1k,10,t5_2qhff

3644547,0,t3_3242hl,Im an NI F. It is possible to do just like how you can take  mls out of a long term PICC line discard it then take your samples. But it isnt accepted practice. You do that in a PICC line because they either have a picc because of bad venous access and therefore youve no choice but to withdraw from the existing line or they are a very chronic patient in which case fewer needles is a kindness. Your average patient in our hospitals who requires venepuncture will have decent access and wont mind the odd needle prick. It helps junior doctors develop their skills at it and reduces the risk of getting a diluted sample if some eijit doesnt withdraw enough from the venflon first say after a nurse has just used it for a saline bag. Plus given how anal infection control are around cannulas Id say the less cannulas are used unnecessarily the happier everyone will be that infection risks are reduced. Its cleaner to prep a new site and use a new sterile needle to take your sample. You may also dislodge the cannula by accident while tampering.The reason we are allowed to use a new cannula preflush to withdraw our bloods is because its clean unused and theres no risk of a diluted sample provided theres no other lines running. A crp alone costs ... So consider that if one ever comes back looking diluted or haemolysed and another venepuncture needs to be attempted after someone took the initial tests from the venflon rather than a fresh site.,medicine,cq7pe6d,3,t5_2qhff

The most important thing is being able to tell them why you want to be a doctor at the interview stage. Get high grades during your degree score well on the GAMSAT the test Australians need to sit to get into grad entry medicine and make a great impression at your interview.Some things to consider are specific prereqs for individual universities. Im in Victoria so thats where most of my research has been focused so far. There are  med schools in Vic. Melbourne Uni requires you to have completed certain nd year subjects to apply. These can be done during your bachelor degree or studied as individual units after if not covered in your course which would be required if you are doing nursing. Monash requires you to have studied biomed or science at Monash and will not accept outside student anymore. Deakin will take anyone based on their GPA GAMSAT results and interview.

Crossover studies are powerful when you can do them at all no washout or carryover effects and obviously you will have a hard time studying things like mortality.But this is very different from trying to use SNPs in a big study to find subgroups which benefit from the drug beyond the average effect which is itself different from trying to predict optimal dosage for a particular drug and person which is itself different from sampling a cancer genome to try to cluster it with cancers in other patients and so on.Some of these things are more doable than others but its hard to compare.

Because  of it is trivia. And the  that might be useful some day depends on whether you ever specialize in which case  of it would be immediately relevant  doubtful  crap. We include the most remotely related crap to medicine we might as well be learning another subject. Heck as a surgeon I know more than the damn pharmacists here. WHY all this unnecessary information? If I wanted to know where to find it in a book Id read the book. In fact with the resources available today that point is pretty close to being obsolete. Being taught to do the gruntwork for residents while finding stuff in obscure textbooks about pharmacology isnt even close to what I signed up for in surgery and hasnt been relevant since.And people change their minds anyway!  year or  years in. Many even quit med school piling on that debt. Whats the argument there that people shouldnt be making decisions for themselves? If the specialties exist why cant people stream directly into them if were old enough to decide what we want to major in if were old enough to decide what degreecourse we want to matriculate into?Im suggesting that somebody make up their minds whether they want me to do the exams or serve my sentence in hours or days or weeks or months or years.

4326296,0,t1_csd6tmf,gt does the fact that Leponex makes someone sleep not give a powerful hint about whats wrong with the chemistryAnd Im saying the answer is no it doesnt. Medicines for cardiac problems are used for migraines and thyroid problems  this does not mean the person has a heart problem. Medicines for depression are used for diabetic pain  this does not mean the person has depression. Medicines for cancer are used for bowel problems  this does not mean the person has cancer. Drugs have many offtarget effects  for example amitriptyline targets depression through one mechanism but it also blocks a different pathway which causes the patient to have a dry mouth and blurred vision. This second part does not do anything to help the patients depression but it is an integral part of taking amitriptyline. We try to design drugs that minimise offtarget effects like that but it isnt always possible. And sometimes these offtarget effects are beneficial in certain circumstances e.g. in my breastfeeding example above.Also I wasnt familiar with Leponex as a brand name but having looked it up I cannot imagine any patient in the UK being given clozapine for insomnia. Im not sure theyd qualify for the patient schemes and cant understand why anyone would justify that level of risk simply for treating insomnia. Has any UK prescriber ever seen this?

What do you know about resuscitation? What are your ultimate goals? What do you need to have a life worth living? Is it any life at all? Is it being painfree? Is it being able to eat and drink normally?Then I go into the discussion of what full code really means in a way that the patient can truly understand.  Remind them that they will still have all the underlying problems and some new ones if resuscitation is successful which it likely wont be if there are significant preexisting conditions.There have been a lot of articles popping up on my radar lately about how medical professionals die compared with the general population.

4801634,0,t3_3gly07,Here is my take I think telemedicine is great and needed. The reason we are scared of telemedicine is that we simply arent trained on how to use it. I think it is important for physicians to lead the way and we should actively pursue legislation that helps rather than hinders those on the front line of this technology.Why is it necessary? Because it is fucking hard to see good doctor when you want to speak with one. Telemedicine should have the potential to reduce ED visits triaging nonemergencies to be seen in the clinic the following day or after a weekend. Telemedicine can also allow rural locations to benefit from expert consultations when those experts are unwilling to live in these locations. Yes this sounds scary but that is because it is new and not a part of our training. I think patients could really benefit if we embrace telemedicine learn how to use it and create legislation that protects this new industry from lawsuits. Instead of figuring how telemedicine fits into the current system we should consider our system broken and think about how telemedicine could make healthcare better for everyone.,medicine,ctzsaq9,3,t5_2qhff

All anyone can do is address the symptoms. Further autism is probably funded in proportion to its relative incidence in the US. Its an economic issue not a fault of medicine. It would be nice if we could identify exactly what happens in utero that leads to autism spectrum disorder but that would require a lot of fundingand for an issue that we cant cure. Psychiatric issues are probably the least pathophysiologically understood of all specialties and for good reason. Thats why psychiatry and neurology are separate fields actually.

5249032,0,t3_3mw2ke,Wow some of these are way off... let me clarify...Primary Care a title for any physician that treats patients for their core routine care in an outpatient setting in other words not in the hospital. This varies from location to location but typically encompasses GP Family Medicine physician Pediatrician and an outpatient internal medicine physicians.General Practitioner Any physician that completes only one year of postmedical school education also known individually as an internship. These doctors are licensed to practice medicine but are not board certified have not completed a residency minimum of three years of postmedical school education and taken board exams. It is very common for people to use General PhysicianPracitioner and Family Physician interchangeable however these are not the same see below.Family Medicine Physician physicians that have completed three years of postmed school education in a Family Medicine Residency and are Board Certified. The difference here between GP and FM is the additional years of education and taking a board exam that tests clinical knowledge in the specialty of family medicine that evaluates your competency. These physicians treat any individual from infancy to senior citizens in all fields of medicine including gynecology some may even deliver babies. Internal Medicine Physician Similar to above they have completed their three years of postmed school education a  year residency are licensed and Board certified. Their residency education typically consists of adults gt years of age without obstetrics. Majority of graduates either go on to become specialists such as pulmonologists cardiologists gastroenterologists endocrinologists etc. or take hospitalist positions they remain in the hospital working. Occasionally some may become primary doctors and work as outpatient physicians strictly.Youve likely gotten your childhood vaccines from a pediatricianFM physician.

Thus no conclusions on the effectiveness of advanced prehospital care in unselected patient cohorts can be drawn.In the prehospital care of sudden cardiac arrest early defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation are still essential further ALS interventions have not been able to demonstrate increased survival. Prehospitally initiated hypothermia is a promising treatment but is not as yet an evidencebased intervention.Prehospitally initiated thrombolysis of myocardial infarction improves survival when compared with inhospital initiation of thrombolytic treatment.There is evidence that ALS is beneficial in epileptic patients and among those with respiratory distress.Due to multiple methodological problems found in trauma studies the comparison of ALS and BLS prehospital care is difficult and in unselected trauma cohorts impossible. It seems obvious that in urban settings and in patients with penetrating injuries ALS does not improve survival. In some patients for instance patients with severe head injuries ALS provided by paramedics and intubation without anaesthesia can even be harmful due to uncontrolled intracranial pressure. If the prehospital care is provided by an experienced physician and by a HEMS organisation Helicopter Emergency Medical Service ALS interventions may be beneficial for patients with multiple blunt injuries.In many patient groups such as patients with cerebrovascular problems intoxication drowning etc. there is very little research available on the effectiveness of ALS and BLS levels of prehospital care and thus no conclusions can be made.The need for high quality controlled clinical studies is obvious.

5494287,0,t3_3q9zvs,Red blanket or no red blanket rich people and poor people experience medicine in vastly different ways. People with money go to their PCPs. People without it dont go to anyone until their issues land them in the ER. People with money write down everything they are told they research their conditions online and they follow instructions to the letter or not depending on what they read. Poor people are often poorly educated and are too embarrassed to tell their doctors that they didnt really understand how to take the insulin that was just prescribed. Not that it matterswhen they leave the hospital with a prescription in hand poor people toss it in the trash because they cant afford the medicine anyway and then come right back and get labeled as noncompliant. The insured can get Sovaldi. The uninsured can die from cirrhosis. The insured can have elective hernia repairs and go back home the same day. The uninsured can wait until they develop a strangulated bowel. The insured can stay at home following their strokes with home health nurses and twice weekly PTOT. The uninsured can spend the rest of their lives at dangerously understaffed nursing homes just begging to get C. diff or participate in a flu breakout or be the victim of a medication error.We already treat people incredibly differently based on their socioeconomic status.

You can even make the situation hypothetical.  Suppose there was an immortality pill that did nothing at all to improve health or reduce suffering it just stopped death from happening without side effects.  Now suppose there was a hypothetical disease that naturally led to death but first caused a great amount of brain damage such that the patient lost most of their ability to form new memories including about the fact they had the disease and lost the ability to move to recognize other people and to experience any positive emotions.  Further this disease causes severe degradation to nerves that carry pain resulting in severe pain that is also intractable.  The patient would never be able to understand why they are in pain or ever be able to treat the pain.  But because of the immortality pill they would never die from the disease.  Could you justify taking away the immortality pill?  You could even go further and ask how could you ethically defend giving an immortality pill to such a patient youd be condemning them to a life indistinguishable from living in hell?That situation meets all your requirements.

The most common scenario is when an outpatient physician gets over their head with an acutely ill patient and really doesnt know how to handle the situation in the immediate term. The most obvious cases are usually ACLS type scenarios when a perhaps elderly or otherwise out of practice physician is attempting to run a code or remember how to manage an unstable arrhythmia.  As vast as the difference is between paramedic and physician training paramedics are very frequently the most capable providers around when it comes to handling these types of situations especially in the field or in an illprepared primary care office.  When I was a paramedic I definitely had to politely relieve a struggling physician in these situations more than a few times.   That said there are many other times where as a paramedic I felt like that doc didnt know WTF they were talking about and I was completely wrong.  Paramedics are experts at ACLS yes perhaps moreso than a great many doctors but it doesnt extend too much beyond that.,medicine,cyllrq6,2,t5_2qhff

6316484,0,t3_41yix0,Im probably completely misunderstanding what youre asking...But if not QdPR and vQA. Upstream arteriole resistance drops via vasodilation increasing flow. Increased flow means an increased velocity when given a fixed area. Like you said the crosssectional area of the venules is fixed. Recall that hydrostatic pressure of the capillaries is influenced by the pressures of the arteriole and the venule. Also recall that a decrease in resistance of either end of the capillary system means that the dilated side will have a larger influence on the capillary hydrostatic pressure. This means the hydrostatic pressure of the capillaries will be higher. A higher hydrostatic capillary pressure means more transudate aka less total intravascular volume at the venous end. Smaller volume  less flow. Smaller Q means a smaller velocity. ,medicine,cz7m474,2,t5_2qhff

If she is in fact a nice person and has no prior record manifesting such behaviors but she is just in one of the worst days of her life at that moment and it sort of just all got out then that deserves to be acknowledged if she has demonstrated this behaviour before then that also deserves to be factored in and acknowledged.

This will happen rarely and virusses can only carry so much genes. To fight HIV you would need a virus that either A destroys all TLymphocytes so the HIVirus has no reservoir in the body or B Inhibits the hiding mechanisms of HIV which will lead the immune system to destroy every cell infected with both virusses leading to strong immune answer against both or C Cut out the HIV genome out of the host cell genome and then destroy it  not feasable to carry such a big ORF for no use other than removing a hidden virus.

The patients on particularly high chronic opioid regimens often get to such dosing because of unreasonable expectations for opioid analgesia and a tendency to catastrophize pain symptoms and these beliefs will only be worse in the acute setting.,medicine,czps4dn,4,t5_2qhff

Engineers on average dont work with lots of information in the same way that doctors do.  At any given time they usually work with far less information but it fits together in extremely complex ways.  You dont really know what critical thinking means until you have to solve or create complex mathematical models.  The realities that engineers deal with have no time for the kind of hand waving clinical instinct that doctors value so highly.Its certainly true that engineers on average have better lifestyles than doctors.  Thats fairly unequivocal.  You are sort of correct in saying that engineers can make a greater difference to the peoples health than individual doctors but a youre now talking about research engineers who are a wholly different beast to your average engineer and who are really more comparable to your average scientist and b large medical projects are never done alone and always with a clinician in the loop.  That could be you if thats what youre interested in.Personally I switched because among other reasons I found that I derived more satisfaction from the ability to make quick immediate differences to peoples lives.

6668159,0,t3_46uxon,Wrong. Naturopaths are not worse.  The patient is unintelligent and the Naturopath in question is liable.  The patient shouldve been intelligent enough to seek traditional medical treatment ALONG WITH consulting a lifestylenutrition expert like a naturopath. He shouldve had the two of you communicating because you likely dont know the first thing about nutrition and its role in disease and the Naturopath likely doesnt know the first thing about traditional medicine and how it treats disease.  This idiotic demonizing of naturopaths is irrational and not founded in reality. If your industries training actually included the role of nutrition and lifestyle in the prevention and treatment of disease then you could be pissed. But its got a gaping hole the size of Texas when it comes to that. And thats a detriment to public health. Naturopaths and functional medicine practitioners are no longer all quacks like homeopaths.  Do not confuse them. Many of these people are heavily versed in studies that my doctor has never bothered to read up on. Chris Kresser is a perfect example of one that could school nearly everyone here in medicine.  These people play a role that is important. Diet and lifestyle are paramount before during and after disease.  But they should never be operating in a vacuum. Especially with a serious disease on the table. The two of you meaning medicine and naturopathy need to get rid of your fucking egos and start working together rather than acting the other parties are just quacks.

6669832,0,t3_46zha0,Here is the thing...what most of the people who recommend it are doing it for two reasons. Bio postdocs do it because unemployment is relatively hard and getting academic positions are nearly impossible as a PhD while as an MD and academic employment is difficult but not impossible depending on where you did your residencyrecsCV. On the other hand doctors recommend it because they are often disenfranchised with medicine. Back in the golden days and even today there was less cookbook medicine diagnosing was fun it was cool to think about. Just look at European doctors they know a bit lessbasic science due to the lack of research interest but overall similar amounts of information to American docs and they cannot use it because the government dictates they have to follow algorithms.

The main circulating strain of Flu B in the UK this year has been from the Victoria lineage. Interestingly this wasnt covered by the trivalent adult flu vaccine this had Flu B from the Yamagata lineage but was in the quadrivalent childhood nasal spare vaccine as this always contains Bs from both lineages. Flu B generally peaks later in the season than A but I wonder if the altered epidemiology susceptible adult population nonsusceptible children has lead to a slowerburning Flu B season this year?,medicine,d1ekf9i,6,t5_2qhff

You claim that it correlates to competence the article claims that it doesnt.gtEvery year to  of medical students from U.S. and Canadian schools pass on their first attempt. Whats more score reports include little more than passfail designations. As a result students medical schools and residency programs learn essentially nothing from the exercise.gtA few studies based on Step  CS numerical ratings never released to students have found that performance on the test might predict eventual performance during residency. But those numerical ratings are inherently subjective its hard to measure interpersonal skills. And the correlations are tenuous at best.

There is no easy answer. Nurses need to have good judgement about what needs to be done urgently by the overnight team and what can wait until the morning and residents need to understand that sick patients do sometimes need attention overnight. If in doubt you should page. If youre worried about the patient you should suggest the resident come to the bedside.If you just paged normal vitals lab results which almost certainly were already seen by the resident or a request to renew a routine order at am you should not be hurt when you do not get a response. If you paged patient now has difficulty breathing and is satting  on a nonrebreather and you dont get a response in lt mins you should keep paging and escalating to more senior residentsfellowsattendings until you do.

That way we all know that said person has some basic level of gun knowledge and is legally entitled to own a firearm.We could call it the Shoot Me First Badge!Ill make you a dealYou read my post and think on it a bit and Ill take the next two GI bleeds to another hospital.  Deal?Deal.Doc the reason I conceal carry when Im not working on my ambalamps is to give myself options in a violent encounter.  I am initially going to be a step behind and in a defensive reactive posture both mentally and physically.  You can liken the beginnings of a violent encounter to an ambush  the aggressor chooses the time place and manner of the assault while the victim can only try and be ready.The only advantage I or any CCW type has in that situation is that I am not the good victimbystander the aggressor thinks I am.  If theres an opportunity or if things get bad enough I can spring a sort of counterambush by employing my weapon.  I might have a second or two while the aggressor realizes things are not as they seem and formulatesexecutes a new series of actions.  I dont know if youve ever been in a violent encounter but Ive been in a lot of them  and a second or two is a loooong time.Something else to considerA pursesnatcher or mugger is probably not going to bother someone whos open carrying.  Its too much risk for too little reward.  That criminal isnt going to enroll in community college and get a job at Arbys though  theyll just go attack someone whos not carrying.  On the other hand if a criminal knows theres a nontrivial chance that their next victim is going to haul out some iron and put warheads on foreheads then theyll consider an easier way to get paid.  Take a look at what happened in Dade County FL after they began issuing CCW Permits in the late s as an example.  The amount of crime was similar except the amount of theft increased and the muggings and carjackings decreased.  The criminals were still in the population but committing less risky to them crimes.In this manner CCW holders can help deter certain types of crime against people who arent carrying.  Presumably we might be able to reach some sort of herd immunity where the outcome for criminals committing violent crime is more likely to result in being drawn on than being paid and muggings go the way of the dodo.As for the Shoot Me First thingIf someone bent on committing a mass shooting sees an armed citizen the shooter is either going to go somewhere else to murder folks like a gun free school theater or bar or simply shoot the armed citizen in the back of the head as their first act.  The openly armed citizen has no opportunity to spring a counterambush.Take a look at this Youtube channel  Its a graphic detailed analysis of armed encounters using video footage from actual incidents.  It shows the good bad and ugly and goes a long way toward explaining where my thinking stems from.Thank you for your time Doc.  Stay careful. ,medicine,d58yqyb,26,t5_2qhff

You state that you want the naturopathic profession to get rid of dangerous practices and therefore be a better profession. This is a commendable goal.gtFirst why then do you castigate Britt for having reported a naturopath for doing illegal things? This seems like a pretty common sense way to use existing regulatory mechanisms to root out bad practitioners. Is it necessary to have to meet a medical practitioner to be concerned about how they might be practicing? I think not. Websites these days provide a plethora of information about how medicine is done so if something catches the attention of someone concerned for patients is it not their ethical duty to report? Would you report one of your fellow NDs if you knew they were up to something illegal? Does geographical distance matter? Out of curiousity what was the illegal thing?gtSecond Britt says that Bastyrs instructors are not medically qualified and you dismiss this because naturopaths are qualified to teach naturopathy. This does not mean that naturopaths are qualified to teach medicine. You missed this logic completely its called a nonsequitur.Truncated,medicine,d5ngcdv,3,t5_2qhff

Efficiency is appreciated.  Quick room turnovers make everybody happy.  Yeah we all get punished with more work for being efficient but the docs arent getting paid between cases so your surgeon and your anesthesiologist will love you if you can make things happen.  We know who the delayers are and we prefer not to work with them.   Communicate!  If there is a delay please tell us why. Lots of times theres nothing that can be done why does every patient need to use the bathroom exactly when its OR time? but sometimes we can speed things up if we know the scoop.  If you see a potential problem speak up!  Be pleasant and part of the team.  It makes everybodys day better.  Plan ahead.  The good OR nurses foresee whats going to be needed and have it in the room.  That comes with experience.  The surgeons card is probably wrong so ask around if youre not sure.  Its frustrating to have to wait for stuff that should be available.  Dont ever be that nurse who delays things so the  addon case will go to another room and you wont have to start it just before you leave at .  The rest of us have to stay.  Show compassion and caring toward the patients.  That can be difficult with some of them but I have unlimited respect for the nurses who make that little extra effort.

In an employee model that more so reflects the value that I provide to the medical group. My chairman said to estimate that my overhead billing coding EMR staffing etc costs about  of my compensation so I personally hope to bill an amount comparable to  of my compensation. In the employee model you dont get fired just because you dont hit that mark but it makes me feel like Ive at least pulled my own weight.To the point your mentor made there was and sort of still is a time when we all made so much we could be totally ignorant of where the money came from and still be onepercenters. That resonates with many of us who resent or even despise the business element of medicine and just want to a take care of patients and b live comfortably. My impression is that we can still be onepercenters particularly proceduralists but its hard to do so and still be financially oblivious. I did fellowship at a very busy dominant private practice group that for several years was consistently losing money with overhead in excess of their revenue stream in large part because the senior partners had the mentality of your mentor. It is a wonderful thing if you can be financially secure without knowing anything about it while doing a satisfying job but it doesnt seem to work in as many situations as it used to.calvangri did accurately describe the main thrust of my sentiment. I understand economically what you mean fakenb. Philosophically there are other points  Equally trained physicians in the rest of the world make dramatically less than US physicians  I was trained in microsurgery by a tech that ran our micro skills center this woman never went to college but could do a better microvascular anastomosis than  of surgeons Ive worked with. I understand that being a physician is more than technique but that experience did lift the illusion that surgeons perpetuate that they are technically gifted.  When I get paid bill  to put  stitches in a digital nerve in a matter of minutes and I pay my landscaper  to toil in the  degree weather for an hour my soul feels some inequity.

This morning she is intubated and sedated and had no complaints.gt gt Me  Do you think Mrs.Jones would be able to complain if she was intubated and sedated?gt gt Medical Student I guess not.

But when their psychiatrist sends a bill to bcbs bcbs says oh ZAR behavioral covers the mental health on that plan.  So you have to submit to ZAR.  Are you a ZAR provider?  Who knows?  In cl the problem is that the psych goes to do something like a competency eval for consent for medical tx.  No psych dx.  Just IM or whoever wanting to cover their asses when gramma is refusing life saving care.  Cl guy sends a bill to bcbs.  Bcbs looks at the npi and sends to ZAR.  Cl guy fights it because its medical.  Bcbs says social work covers the mental health part of the medical and is covered as part of the facility fee.  Cue all sorts of bullshit.

9235201,0,t1_d8mhhcz,I grew up in the southwest however I did my college medical school and ortho residency in New England. The northeast has a very different culture than the west coast  that permeates nearly every aspect of life. I strongly considered transferring colleges after my first semester because I thought everyone just seemed a little mean compared to what I was used to. Eventually I got used to it and now when I visit family back home I find people in general to be a little too sunny. That being said it would not surprise me if the northeast medical community seemed more tough and hierarchical than elsewhere in the country.

9509144,0,t1_d9kzt09,I havent been practicing medicine for that long. I just finished residency in June. But in the past . years or so Ive had to do a fair number of death notifications. One of the worst was actually the PCP.I was a third year resident and in the midmorning a something year old man came in in cardiac arrest. Later review of his medical records showed he had the usual medical problems of hypertension and high cholesterol. Apparently he was at an outpatient lab waiting to get his blood drawn when he collapsed. Initial rhythm for EMS was Vfib they shocked him a couple of times en route before he went into asystole a couple minutes before pulling up to the hospital. We didnt get him back. Obviously telling the wife when she got in was tough. Somehow telling his doctor was worse. We presumed cardiac even though he was actually in pretty good health. There were no signs of foul play so I called the PCP to see if he would certify the death certificate. When he got on the phone I told him what had happened. He didnt say anything at first until all I heard was a soft I just saw him two days ago he was fine I was just checking his cholesterol... I could hear the wheels in his head turning trying to figure out what he had missed. I dont think he missed anything. I think he just had an MI. My job can be hard trying to tell people you met  seconds earlier that their loved one is dead. But when I go home thats relatively easy to leave at work. Some of it goes with me sure. But I cant even fathom what PCPs go through sometimes with unexpected deaths of people theyve known for years.

That doesnt sound right but I dont know enough about this to dispute it. gt Just as drivers learn to drive under supervision in real life on the road residents must prepare in real patientcare settings for the situations they will encounter after graduation said Dr. Thomas Nasca ACGMEs chief executive officer So all doctors in the US work hrs without breaks? When do you fucks eat? or sleep? or shit? or live in general? gt The longer shifts could improve patient care by minimizing the number of times interns have to pass their patients onto someone else to continue their treatment the council says. Mistakes can occur as a result of those handoffs the group says. Now I am no smartypants but is this not a problem with protocol? Couldnt this be solved with a checklist of sorts or improved routines? Additional thoughts It is utterly retarded that doctors are sacrificed on the altar of patient safety.

9945841,0,t1_db3y72j,I guess I can be a little sympathetic to the administrators problem. They are trying to weed out attendings who will have some difficulty managing their own mistakes. Hospitals are risk averse often at the expense of physician autonomy or evidencebased care. But hospitals are also places where physicians have a huge impact on patient satisfaction and arguably more importantly staff satisfaction. A physician that is unable to reflect on errors shift blame or make the argument that the process is purely for the benefit of people who can demonstrate... prefabricated excellence may end up being a problem for the hospital culture. I think your reply is especially valuable because the hospital administrator really doesnt care about the physicianpatient dynamic. They care about the bottom line. They want a physician that wont make mistakes. Nobody is blinding themselves to this. But given that this is an unrealistic expectation it sounds like they are settling for a physician who minimizes the risk as much as possible.And thats probably why the interview question is so offensive to you me or any physician actually face to face with the patient and directly accountable with the gravity of our decisions. Lastly I suppose the issue I take with your reply retractable is it seems to imply that forgetting about mistakes after changing your practice is part of the normal pattern of reflection and growth. I respectfully disagree. Im not as good as you are with that. I like occasionally reflecting on the good and bad experiences for learning. I try not to forget the patients that I have failed in some way because putting the case to the practice helps me retain that information.

Then I weigh the two and see if at the end of the day I can make them better because results are more than physical. I could perform a perfect surgery but mentally patient would still not be satisfied. Our mantra is first do no harm mental or physical. So in your case Im not OBGYN Id probably discuss alternatives like IUDs and hormone pills. Tubal ligation would be a last option given the risks of surgery vs the benefits. Imagine if this completely elective procedure to make you sterile that could have been avoided with alternatives like IUDs ends up with you getting a perforated colon and a colostomy bag for life. Obviously an extreme example but its something we surgeons think about every time we discuss surgery with a patient. Would you be ok shitting into a bag to get your tubal ligation? If not then you have no business getting the procedure done. Its not about infantalizing you its about the fact that youve never seen all the bad things that happen with surgery. Unless you yourself are a OBGYN doc you have no idea the ramifications this surgery entails. So you can be butt hurt but America is pretty surgery happy so if the surgeon is saying no remember were incentivized to perform surgery usually theres usually a good reason. ,medicine,dc333fu,7,t5_2qhff

Blood transfusions routinely save lives in situations where there are no viable alternatives for patients who then go on to live full healthy lives.This is true but most people who refuse blood products do so out of a sincerely held belief that the risk of death is better than the chance of needing blood products.

10341532,0,t3_5nvzjd,Id say look at the result of the tachycardia. In case one Id suspect the patients cardiac index was actually less than it would be if they were rate controlled. The echo was reported normal but whats normal in the presence of afib? Surely there was impaired ventricular end diastolic filling? By slowing afib youll actually improve cardiac output. The second case probably had a great cardiac output. Regular sinus tachy is efficient up to about  bpm in that the faster the rate up to  the more the cardiac output. So by slowing their rate youd be reducing their cardiac output. In some elderly people or people with cardiac disease the limit of  comes down. Then in people with at risk of ischaemic heart disease remember coronary arteries fill in diastole having a fast rate reduces coronary perfusion below their threshold which is far lower than a healthy persons. At the risk of sounding like a GP you have to consider the patient as a whole. Look at their haemodynamics in their current state. Then look at the states you can create will they give better tissue perfusion or not and then decide. ,medicine,dcg9sf0,1,t5_2qhff

10380733,0,t1_dcjl2y3,When I was choosing between med school and PA school the most prominent consideration in my mind was the autonomy of an MDDO vs the flexibility of a PA. I choose the latter and do not regret it to this day. I started my career in ER got burned out after  years so I switched to working locum tenens around the country in underserved clinics practicing internal medicine. I have no idea what I will do next be it spine surgery or nephrology I will certainly learn something valuable everyday and grow as a clinician with the help of a more learned doctors mentorship. I think our ability as a profession to switch between various medical and surgical specialties with ease really speaks to the rigorous and comprehensive nature of our training however the lack of post graduate training I believe makes us better served as dependent providers.

This used to be the typical construct of a PA. Unfortunately the majority of PA school grads now are fasttracked from playground recess to the hospital. They never obtain perspective as there is no time for context. So what we have now is an increasing number of entitled millenials who have  years of overfocused training and zero exposure or understanding. It often improves with time but a new batch is born every day. Young andor foolish PAs dont like to admit that we are the fast food of the restaurant industry. We bring pros and cons. When I want to impress a woman on the first date I dont take her to Mcdonalds. When my loved one has a complex illness I dont take them to see a PA. It is fair and accurate however to say that in a few less exciting arenas PAs do provide care as good as a physician. Its not because of academic equality though. Its often in settings where disease has a low acuity and attention to detail and the time to give that attention is needed. One example is preventative medicine. Although that can only be the case if there is influence and direction by a physician. I work in surgery and critical care at a teaching hospital. I am usually but not always quicker to find an answer than a strd year surgery or medicine resident. This is mostly just because Ive been there forever. They typically surpass me in knowledge around the nd or rd year and their skills surpass me around rd or th. Thats a good thing because I am not a doctor. For those of you who are currently suffering through residency forgive the young PA who has no idea what youre going through in order to do your trade. Be friendly and teach them.

10771127,0,t3_5ty5gc,Obviously a very personal decision.  If I could have had a baby in early med school I would have done so instead of waiting until I was an attending like I did.  It is hard to have a baby when you are  years old compared to early s.  You have more health issues and its not like you have more time and now you are an OLD parent and probably not as energetic playing with the kid.  Also waiting so long limits how many kids you can have as you eventually just get to old to have them.  I am pregnant with my last one now at  years old and it is pretty miserable!  The only advantage is that you have money and can afford child care.  Since both of you are in med school you will need a plan as to who will watch the baby when you are in school and how you will pay for it.   It is also likely that you could delay  year of school to care for the baby or your husband could.

They get hooked and then whatever doc that prescribed them catches on and refers them to pain management.  Once a patient starts going to pain management you might as well accept that they will be lifetime opiate users. Their tolerance gets ramped up with opiates far too strong for what they need as well as the fact that a huge portion are on fentanyl.  At this point these patients cant safely just cease taking the opiates they likely have had some experience with withdrawal and most will do nearly anything to avoid that and then theres all the garbage that opiates will do to a persons brain.

But despite the studys title Im not convinced thats the correct interpretation of their data. The study design discussion doesnt make it clear. Did the actual conclusions of the doctors change in the second cohort? Or just the diagnostic codes they used? Edit I cant read. Found the actual full text and not the abstract. Curious to see if those details are in there.Edit  Fullscale clinical trials of DSS for diagnosis are complicated by the lack of welldefined measures of diagnostic performance applicable to realworld settings Kudos to them for including this important caveat. As a wise man once said good against remotes is one thing good against the living? Thats something elseNine GPs commented that although the scenarios were representative they would not expect to see them all in a single practice session referring to the severity or urgency of the patients condition.Exactly my thoughts. Add in the fact that its a study and the GPS are going to be on their toes in theory this would affect both normal EHR and DSS sessions equally but its still another variable.But overall Im much more impressed with this after reading the full study. I encourage anyone who is curious to take the time to read it. Bottom line is that the DSS appears to be an effective tool for generating a healthy initial differential list and for compiling the documentation in an ongoing manner. Very cool stuff. Im still not convinced that the absolute diagnostic accuracy improvement will translate to real patients but its definitely worth seeing in clinical trials to find that out.,medicine,dea6wd3,7,t5_2qhff

11285876,0,t3_60ysj0,Using a throwaway account here because Id rather not link my post history to my institutionitd be pretty easy for others to figure out who I am. But I figured Id provide some inside perspective as an M at Mt. Sinai because I think being here and knowing the administration is important for providing context for whats in this article and those within our institution have a very different opinion about this article than what Im seeing in the comments. Warning Long comment belowIll preface this by sharing my own limited and personally removed experience with Kathryns death and what Ive seen over the last few months since then from the administration. As the article mentions most of our first year class had been on campus for no more than a week or two and we were in the middle of orientation when we woke up to an email that a mandatory Town Hall meeting had been called for all students. Word spread pretty quickly that someone had jumped from her apartment window the very same apartment building in which almost all of us live. Most of us did not know Kathryn and for me personally it was incredibly strange to go through a tragedy that felt in one way so close to home yet at the same time so impersonal given that I had never interacted with her. The town hall was intense and featured a lot of finger pointing and angry students rightfully accusing the administration of not providing appropriate mental health resources issues like hospital providers within our system not taking insurance for continuous care etc not looking after students wellbeing during rd year and the stress that clerkships and subinternships can cause particularly in the way that attendings treat students. For many first years this was scary especially given that all through interview season and revisit Id felt that Sinai had been the school that had made the most genuine effort by far to get to know me and what my goals were. While I cant say for sure I dont think that anyone can say for certain why Kathryn committed suicide. People have tried to link the timing of it to Step  grades ERAS submission etc but the reality is she could and likely did have a host of personal and professional stressors in her life that are her and her familys business and have no place in a NEJM article. Many in the comments have criticized how impersonal Dean Mullers thoughts are on Kathryn but in my opinion this article is not meant to be a tribute to her life but rather the beginning of a discussion of how our school has responded to this tragedy and what medical education across the country needs to change to prevent tragedies like this from happening elsewhere. Within our own institution Kathryns death provided was a catalyst for students to express their frustrations over a number of mental health and mistreatment concerns shared by many throughout the school directly related to the learning environment particularly in the clinical years where its more difficult to track students. The administrations response has thus been in part a direct response to Kathryns death but also largely focused on addressing problems that are common for all students. While there are lots of things that still need to change the administration has in my opinion taken an incredibly handson and incredibly involved approach to addressing a number of the concerns listed above. Just recently those efforts were highlighted in article in the WSJ Changes we are already seeing include changing the policy on rd grades and class rank increasing access to longterm mental health services and making wellness a part of everyday conversation at Sinai to the point where its almost become a lighthearted meme. Im saddened to see the finger pointing in the comments towards Dean Muller in particular and the characterization of this piece as being lip service with no real action especially when those of us who are students here are already seeing those changes. Can there be more? Absolutely. Should there be more? Unquestionably and both students and faculty are working towards that as the article highlights above. This article is far from perfect and I take issues with a number of things in it plugging dropping out of the rankings which is opposed by students in a survey that was done internally etc. Perhaps titling the piece Kathryn and avoiding talking about her at all was offputting to some but to me that has more to do with protecting her and her familys privacy more than Muller not knowing Kathryn well. He knows almost everyone at this school and I understand how this letter could come across as fake if you havent had any real contact with him or the other deans because  hes almost impossibly genuine to the point where you might interpret it as fake before actually meeting him. Many of the deans know me by name know where Im from and ask me questions about my personal life regularly. Dean Muller hosts groups of students out to his home to have dinner with his family on a monthly basis. The act of publishing this article is in my opinion commendable and sincere as many medical schools and universities in this country would prefer to keep suicide on their campus quiet and not discuss it. Beyond protecting Kathryns privacy the publishing in the NEJM means that the focus of the article should be on broader topics related to medicine which I think is the intention of the article and I think it does so well. To me this article is less about Kathryns death and honoring her memory but more about sparking a conversation about the culture inherent to medicine and our medical education about how much pressure students are under and how our institutions dont do nearly enough to support that stress. You might disagree with the changes being proposed less focus on the MCAT and grades etc which Sinai does through our FlexMed program which I think are valid concerns but I think its undeniable that something has to change and at the very least this article proposes some set of solutions that might prevent another incident like this from occurring. ,medicine,dfb8k84,4,t5_2qhff

Overall mortality was assessed mainly to ensure comparability between trial groups because no reduction in overall mortality was anticipated from the intervention in view of the small proportion of all deaths caused by prostate cancer...Allcause mortality did not differ between the two trial groups.Two thoughts on this. The trial randomized  patients to  of  arms.  If at the start the authors dont think that the absolute effect is significant enough to see a statistically significant difference in such a large sample size then I dont know how they are thinking any real difference if one exists can possibly be clinically relevant.. I understand why researchers measure diseasespecific mortality but Im with you  diseasespecific mortality is a nearworthless endpoint.But lets be real.  What caused the USPSTF to shift their recommendation isnt the ERSPC study but rather politics.  A handful of lobbyists in the US are itching to get rid of the USPSTF altogether arguing that the USPSTF are getting inbetween patients and their doctors and that the USPSTF are somehow responsible for carerationing ignoring that USPSTF explicitly does not consider costeffectiveness in its recommendations.

The Surg program already has incorporated into its curriculum rotations in vascular surgery sicu surg onc enturo. They told me that I would get an elective month in basically whatever I wanted and im not sure what I should go with. Ultimately I want to go into IR so given the choice should I just do vascular sicu or some medical subspecialty. They have a other kind of interesting rotations that are catheter based like regional pain fellowships in anesthesia and a whole ultrasound elective in EM.
