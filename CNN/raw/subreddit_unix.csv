Im sure FreeBSD is also a good option.Im assuming you want to be a sysadmin. So.... Install the OS multiple times using different options Play around with networking and filesystem creation Learn to write shell scripts using bash andor ksh Learn to patch or update the system Learn about creating usersgroups and sudo Learn how to parse log files using bash or perl after you know where they are and what they are for Figure out how to backuprecover the systemIf you want to get into understanding the inner workings of the OS then you arent ready yet.
