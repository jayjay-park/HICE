Does  sound reasonable for a job like that? Im just wondering if maybe it would be a good idea to take it back to the local shop if I cant find anyone around me.,Autobody,d9j5wbd,1,t5_2r7jk

That quarter panel is questionable from photos on if I would replace or repair however. If its replace off hand maybe  ? Thats without doing any calculations on my estimating software tho. Due to the nature of damage Id also look to see if there is any damage on your rim be surprised how a small ding can throw off a wheels balance. ,Autobody,dds3fos,3,t5_2r7jk
