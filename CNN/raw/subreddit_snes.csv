527287,0,t3_205kwj,I have been unsuccessful in this.You need special tools to desolder that chip. Doing it by hand with a soldering iron and solder wick just doesnt cut it. I killed my SNES doing this after spending  on another broken SNES. I eventually found a SNES for  locally and just bought that. To reiterate those pins are so tiny and it is impossible to completely desolder all the pins and have the chip simply lift away. Ive heard you can try with a heat gun but unless you are very talented and very experienced it isnt going to happen.I have AV modded my saturn Genesis and N and have modded a switch onto my softmodded PS to switch the lidsensor on and off among various other electronics projects so I consider myself pretty skilled at soldering etc.This project was too much for me.,snes,cg07j5p,2,t5_2rany

2968833,0,t3_2u4kxz,I personally havent really liked the gameplay or battle system of virtually anything that Square has made despite the fact that I see how good the games and the stories are theyre very interesting games but the gameplay is what bores me and I enjoy a lot of RPGs.  because of my own experience I wouldnt suggest that as a start in the genre.  and for the same reason along with the very convoluted nature of early Final Fantasy gameplay elements Id not recommend any games from that series.  if it has to be SNES I dont think the best RPGs to introduce the genre exist on there with a lot of them being a bit messy and hard for a beginner to understand.  if youre hooked on Super Nintendo you might try playing something like Kirby Super Star with her.  its a lot of fun and you can play cooperatively in nearly every subgame.  I think its one of the best multiplayer games on the system and its something very simple to start very enjoyable to complete and still has some challenge for an experienced gamer and as expected from Kirby its also a very cute and happy game.  some parts might be a little fast for her but generally you can pace yourself a bit more with that.  if youre set on RPG because of the slower pace which it sounds like you are Id go a generation or two ahead and go with Paper Mario on the N or its Gamecube sequel The Thousand Year Door.  some people have said Super Mario RPG and despite its great reviews and some people calling it the best game of all time for me I didnt think it was nearly as good as the first two Paper Mario games.  its very possible the fact that I havent liked Final Fantasy or many other Square battle systems is the reason why I dont like Super Mario RPG either.  from my perspective the first two Paper Mario games are a bit simpler and much more interesting to play.  theyre also much quirkier in my opinion.  depending on how much she enjoys the planning and strategy elements you might also go with something in the Fire Emblem series.  turnbased strategy with RPG style battles might be something she enjoys if you said she likes a slower paced game.  both Fire Emblem  the GBA game which had no English subtitle and Fire Emblem Awakening the th and newest game in the series are designed for newcomers into the series.  and of course if neither of those more traditional style RPGs interest her Pokemon games have a lot of RPG elements in them which she might also like.  that might be a little more confusing for her because typing is a thing thats very crucial and gets a little more complex but if she knows anything about Pokemon she might like that.  Im honestly not sure where she should start if she did have an interest in Pokemon.  games like Emerald or Platinum are some of the best ones in the series.  for generation  theres no definitive game just look at exclusives and follow up with the proper sequel.  for generation  again nothing definitive just look at exclusives and decide between Hoenn and Kalos.  Kalos is likely to be a better start for gen  because its a massive region.  good luck I hope all that helps and I hope you can help her find something she will enjoy.  ,snes,co5kkkl,3,t5_2rany

4612134,0,t1_ctb8eho,I always say that FF has the most effective use of music in any game. Those compositions and the situationsenvironmentsdialogue they accompany are imprinted on my psyche and they fit so flawlessly that its hard to say whether they capture or define their essence.The only game that comes close is Chrono Trigger but it somehow seems more limited? Does it make sense for me to say that I like the music from Chrono Trigger best but that FF had better use of music? And that by the same token Chrono Trigger is the best game and FF is my favorite? I have to admit that Chrono Trigger has the better story characters world and lore but I like the way FFs story is told better and so much of that is due to a deftly placed and perfectly crafted musical score. Anyway thanks for appreciating this game like I do. ,snes,ctbxvlk,2,t5_2rany

Its slightly lighter than a real controller and the buttons feel a bit different but the build quality feels just as good as my real SNES ones.I paid  USD for it shipped from Japan.

Cosmo gang the video is the closest thing to Galaga for the snes that Ive ever seen and is pretty fun. Rendering ranger r is an awesome but very rare and expensive contra styled game.

7029388,0,t3_4bwyc0,First off you should know that collecting for SNES is pretty darn expensive so if youre just trying to play the games you should see if Virtual Console or emulation would be a better option for yourself. If hard copy collecting is where your heart is a decent condition SNES will run you about  on ebay. Before buying however you should know what sort of TV you want to play it on. They look absolutely awful on most modern HDTVs so the cheapest way to get a good picture out of it is to grab a free CRT off Craigslist or just do whatever youre doing with your N. Svideo cables are recommended for a better picture if you can get em.You can get a good picture out of it for your HDTV as well but itll cost a few hundred dollars.As for good gameshidden gems you can find tons of those lists by searching this subreddit.Also if youre mostly interested in playing the games on the original hardware but dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on games check out the SNES Everdrive which is a flash cartridge that can hold and play almost the entire SNES library as well as some awesome romhacks on the original SNES hardware.SNES consoles yellow because of the type of plastic that was used in their manufacturing.

10600880,0,t1_dd8s8kl,This for me really nails it.  Theres a reason that new socalled bit style games mimic the SNES style and not the NES or even PS despite there being just as much of a nostalgia factor.  I would even argue that the SNES rom hacking scene is still the biggest of any other platform for the same reason the SNES has enough power to look good sound good and have a substantial story but you have to work for it.Take character design.  Currently characters can be rendered down to individual hairs have hours of voiced cinematics and  hours of play time but still be lacking in staying power.  Because the SNES had such a limited space to work in the designs had to take a few key components of a character and blow them up so that they could be seen.  Same with the dialog it had to be saved for times when it was either necessary to advance the plot or if it would add something significant to the player experience.  While this kept games lean it also created extremely iconic characters and left a lot of room for players to fill in the gaps which made the characters more personally compelling.I find something similar in world design.  Todays worlds are huge and gorgeous and yet still somehow monotonous.  There may be a highly designed main city and a number of critical way points but the unimportant locations are just collections of shops with a story point tacked on which lie between large relatively plain expanses.  SNESera towns while not always important tend to require more revisitation hold more story per town and be more purposefully crafted because there are fewer of them.There are many good RPGs for the Nintendo handhelds that hold a similar style but even then I find they drag on theres a lot of unimportant dialog and uninteresting locations and their character just dont stick with me the same way.,snes,dd9eefv,2,t5_2rany

10885066,0,t1_ddzwmp4,FF Mystic Quest is my all time favorite game. Its not the best game by any means but was my first SNES game and intro to RPGs. The music and the imagery was very awesome for me as a kid. Lots of nostalgia for me behind that title. ,snes,de2ptr3,1,t5_2rany

11233522,0,t3_5zre7l,Id actually like a custom Switch that looked like a SNES or really a custom anything. They should have called the Wii U the UNES and make it look like it too.,snes,df5ayyo,1,t5_2rany
11239008,0,t1_df5fef4,Why not buy a sports game and then print out the sticker for the game you want and put it over it isnt that the same deal? ,snes,df5xbiw,1,t5_2rany

11268354,0,t3_60tadu,I think it depends on the virtual console situation of the Switch. They might not want to offer a competing product to this rumored online service. Some of the best SNES games also have liscencing issues.   NES classic was probably designed to pad Nintendos sales numbers thru the last holiday season without a viable new console to push on Black Friday. ,snes,df991x7,2,t5_2rany
11297377,0,t3_617x5u,Its hard to tell from the pics if the board is just REALLY dirty or if perhaps some of the traces leading to the pins are cut.For example the first pin in that second picture there are  dark lines cutting across the trace. If those are deep gouges and not just gunk on the surface it could mean the signal from the chip isnt making it to that pin at all. But like everyone else my money says its just really dirty.You might have fouled up your SNES trying to play it too the gunk can transfer to the consoles pins. ,snes,dfcjh7p,3,t5_2rany
