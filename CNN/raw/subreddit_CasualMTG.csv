264991,0,t1_cf880cj,I like the splash of blue mostly because Ive seen what some really wellplaced spells can do to people without counterspell.

387444,0,t3_1y1j8l,What I really feel like this deck is missing is  Upheaval. Back when this card was standard Upheaval was the gamewinner right behind the guy with the toothy grin. That is when cards like Force Spike and Circular Logic locked up your opponent. Skip the discard go with Nightscape Familiar. If youre going to play green make it worth your while by using Mystic Snake instead of Decay otherwise there is really no reason for a Psychatog deck to run green. Definitely keep to Memory Lapse over Leak. Every time I use to cast this I tell you it was like a instant speed Time Walk. I would personally recommend using Accumulated Knowledge over Brainstorm. My old tog deck looked something like this  Nightscape Familiar toothy Upheaval Counterspell  Memory Lapse Force Spike yes really Circular Logic Fact or Fiction Opt I wouldve used Accumulated Knowledge if I couldve RepulseAether Burst Salt Marsh Underground River Cephalid Coliseum Island Swamp,CasualMTG,cfkxa77,1,t5_2uo3g

Guardian of Light I like the idea of throwing in some black something like Abhorrent Overlord? once my group starts to figure it out.

764936,0,t3_22wkut,one think you should look into it just getting more burn cards. I run RW burn in standards and it has  creatures and then over  cards  maybe? that deal damage to my opponent. chandras phoenix are great cards as they can either attack as a  mana burn spell for  or you can use them to chump block. Of course if you are playing more casual their may be a getter choice in creatures for you. I would also at some chained to the rocks they can be used to exile big creatures as long as you have a mountain and a source of white mana. I would take out hail of arrows and silence for  of the mizziums though you could put more in but at least those,CasualMTG,cgr88ve,1,t5_2uo3g
1064817,0,t1_chozk4o,I definitely second this! Buying singles is a great and costeffective way to build a deck but not to build your collection. Your local game store should have boxes of commons and uncommons mine had the former at  and the latter at  of hopefully many past sets. Wikipedia has a huge list of all sets within their blocks that includes a description of the set symbols which might be handy when searching through bulk cards. Also in that list it links to pages for each blockcycle that describes the main mechanics for block. ,CasualMTG,chpbomb,3,t5_2uo3g

1968795,0,t3_2h7c5k,I occasionally play  maybe  to  games a year  But I have been collecting x of the Common amp Uncommon cards in each set.  I feel like the commons and uncommons give me the most collection for the money spent.  Chasing rares can get expensive fast!  Plus it is easy find a x UC set on ebay so when I am out of the game for a few months it is easy to catchup.I occasionally buy rares if they are  or less or print them myself them as oversized cards because my  y.o. son thinks Oversized cards are the most fun to play with .  My occasional playgroup really only plays Toy Boat Mayhem format so it is fine to have DIY rares.   ,CasualMTG,ckqfvoz,2,t5_2uo3g
2069320,0,t3_2ik182,Firstly whats with folks down voting this topic? OP seems like he genuinely wants an explanation here and isnt being a jerk...I think casual magic vs spikey magic to me is easily explained by using a car building analogy. I the casual player see something like an El Camino and go hah thats different I bet I could make that into something. I spend a little money on it make it ride ok but mostly focus on making it look good and fun to drive. I show it off to my friends not because its the best car out there but because I put my imagination into it. Some of them look at it and think its cool and others wonder why I would ever take the time to try and drive an El Camino.You the spikey player see an el camino and say no way is that thing winning a race not worth my time and you understandably choose something more akin to your goal like a challenger hellcat. You tweak it over and over until youre certain it can win the race focusing entirely on how well it can run. See the thing is were both at the same car show but were bringing completely different cars for completely different purposes. Not to say one way is better than another. You will win races with your car and if Im lucky I will have a few people say bitchin El Camino! and want to build one themselves so we can cruise around. edit to further expand on this its not that I dont want to win like a lot of other folks here are saying its just that I would rather the game to last a little bit longer than be over in  turns because I drew the exact cards I need to counter the exact type of deck youre playing. That to me just isnt fun unless I am in a professional competitive format which is another point. If I am playing my casual friends with casual decks and theyre missing land drops maybe I wont attack with my guys for a turn or two to give them a chance to let their deck play out. Sometimes this gets me killed sometimes it makes the game enjoyable to me. Much better to have an actual back and forth than just destroy someone with not enough lands. I would never do this against my friends who are not casual because its just not the same.,CasualMTG,cl2utt0,10,t5_2uo3g

2616882,0,t1_cmxizy4,A little format my friends and I came up with is called Toy Boat Mayhem. It is really budget friendly and new player friendly because each deck only has two rare cards and it is Singleton Just like EDHcommander.  The format is still not well known about  visitors in the last  months to the rules page so it is very likely that your friends have never heard of it either but it is a very solid format if you can convince your buddies to give it a whirl.

2736269,0,t1_cnevoiy,I felt like I was adding a lot of creatures into my deck mostly due to my limited amount of sorcery and instant cards. If I got more duplicatescards with similar abilities should I cut down my creature supply?As a beginner I recommend you keep your deck at  lands  creatures and the rest spells. This will fluctuate as you learn the game but this is a solid formula for a new players deck.As for multiple copies consider this do you want to include one copy of a great creature one copy of a soso creature one copy of a creature thats good in certain situations and one copy of a poor creature or four copies of the great creature? You arent limiting your number of creatures you are trimming the poor cards from your deck and adding more of the good stuff.You may be thinking that having one copy of creatures that can help in limited situations is a good idea but keep in mind you will only see that one copy once per game and that isnt a good strategy. You dont bring a Swiss army knife to a tank fight. Playing with creatures that are great in all situations is a more sound strategy.Stop for a moment and ask yourself How do I want this deck to win? Anything that does not fit that strategy needs to be replaced with things that do. Your deck should never have a main strategy of this card stops this...this card can do this...this card is great when...if my opponent does this I can do... From what I can see your deck strategy is My deck wins by attacking with hard to block flying creatures. Build on that. Gain more copies of flyers and use removal to keep those hard to block lanes clear.Keep also in mind that you can keep a sideboard of  cards. These  cards are the cards you use against certain decks or spells. This is your utility. After your first game against a player you can add these cards to your deck. Even more reinforcement that your main deck needs to be focused on your strategy not an antiother decks strategy.As a beginner your hindering enchantments are fine. As you learn you will find that instant removal is usually better than being forced to cast during your main steps only.Good questions!,CasualMTG,cnf3o3z,3,t5_2uo3g

3189709,0,t3_2wnhtq,Straight off Im seeing that you have a lot of single cards. To make your deck more consistent I would select a few cards you like and run playsetsgt of them a deck can only have  of one card in it unless the card says you can have more or if youre playing EDH or Tiny Leaders then your only allowed  of each card. I would consider running more Hammerhand because they can really open up the bored for your attack as youre creatures have quite small toughness on the most part and easily picked off by big creatures. I would look at Frenzied Goblin for the same reasons. I would probably take out Arc Lighting for Lightening Strike because it has a cheaper mana cost.Id take out Anger of the Gods too. Because when you cast it you will have to expect a lot of your creatures to die. Id move it to your sidebored.Poweress is a really strong mechanic in burn right now. Id try and get some Monastery Swiftspears but they can be expensiveish But theres a lot of other red poweress cards you can run.I like Mogis in this deck he seems like a good bomb to win the game with but for your deck I would try and get Purphoros God of the Forge. Although he might not be active as a creature as much he will burn your opponent loads more.But yeah my main advice would be too have less variety of cards and more of a few if that makes sense. It will make your deck a lot more reliable. Hope this helps!,CasualMTG,cosm33i,1,t5_2uo3g

4199853,0,t1_cryt39o,Its a pillowfort card by design and sometimes  thats the best thing to do with it. Ive never seen one of the epic spells used in a deck before! If I would change anything I would use fewer land tutors for some more pillowfort type cards such as Ghostly prison or ensnaring bridge as the  mana for neverending torment isnt hideous and while they do thin your deck you really dont need that many land searchers.

4601545,0,t3_3e0b6q,I would say that while tutors arent exactly bad shuffling is going to be a problemespecially in game  so you might want to try to go another route. ie things like golden wish and death wish Ring of Marf or use something like a proteus staff in a creatureless deck to allow yourself to stack the deck. Maybe add  fluctuator and lots of cycling cards or lots of trinket type cards similiar to an eggs deck. locket of yesterdays may be worth checking out as well. Draw spells also go very well in a locket deck.  Yet another idea would be to use cards like Undercity Informer and Balustrade Spy along with something like elixer of immortallity.      Of course these are all just ideas on actually getting BoW out of your deck aside from the pillowfort recommendations elsewhere in the thread you could try using reset buttons.      Edit   on second thought I doubt the locket is any good in a  card deck.,CasualMTG,ctam34g,4,t5_2uo3g

6822053,0,t3_493luk,I really enjoy Planechase Archenemy and even vanguard.  They all offer a fun twist to deck building similar to EDHs color restrictions.  I do find that Planechase lots of times slows the game or just adds chaos.  If you play the way its intended where each player has a planar deck it helps to give it direction instead of just chaos.  It also causes some build around me decks and makes you really want to roll on to one of your planes.If you play with one communal stack there is a variant where you lay  planes in a .  Youre on the center plane when you walk you get to pick which one to go to.  If you hit an edge you flip new planes so youre on the middle and remove the furthest ones.  Link  You can also play where a diagonal move flips a random plane.
