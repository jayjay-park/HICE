9576418,0,t1_d9tf93p,That literally applies to every matchup.Use your wave control and pushing power to force him to waste mana on the wave rather then on you. Save your zapp for cs that you would have to trade with lucian to get early or after he uses his dash.Dont trade with lucian levels  if you canthere are exceptions to this rule. Hes very strong then.Lucian is stronger then you after first back so be very careful when trading with him if he got a good base timing.Most importantly know what he can do. combo video It makes avoiding bad situations and creating good ones much easier,leagueofjinx,d9thm4f,2,t5_2yr5r
9786237,0,t1_dajcvzv,Ah I see my bad still think its not a superb choice. I think you might be underestimating attack speed on jinx. ,leagueofjinx,dajd7qz,1,t5_2yr5r
10145704,0,t3_5l9d74,I would say Caitlyn Varus slightly Tristana and if Lucian were not so shitty right now him too. A good Ashe can also give you hell if she can kite correctly. That being said know your lane matchups well. Know exactly what they CAN do at any given time Does Tristana have Jump? Can they allin me? How much Mana does cait have and how many traps has she laid? and play according to that. It is much better to be SAFE than banking on them not making the optimal choice.Source k Jinx Main,leagueofjinx,dbtzllp,3,t5_2yr5r
10212140,0,t3_5m8ckm,Watch your mana pool and use it sparingly.  I like using rockets to poke the enemy lane opponent and then using R to finish them once I hit .  One rocket every  seconds is  damage per  seconds at lvl  or  damage per minute.  With a health regen rate of  hp per minute at lvl  thats still  damage per minute.  Meanwhile your mana will regen back to full after  seconds so you can do this indefinitely.  A level  ADC has less than HP and a level  one typically has lt HP.  This will only take  minutes to whittle them to half health then you and your support can just allin them.,leagueofjinx,dc1lqtr,2,t5_2yr5r
10217152,0,t3_5m8ckm,Uhh I honestly think it comes from experience knowing how much mana you are comfortable having what you can get away with to poke and establish lane dominance.If you are ever trading with minigun though and the opponent that isnt caitlyn trades an auto or two when they back off you can go to fishbones and get a free unanswerable automaybe two at the end of the trade be careful of getting all inned though by the likes of tristana or lucian,leagueofjinx,dc2671w,2,t5_2yr5r

11640594,0,t1_dgdr9vs,. Life steal allows you sustain through lane and is good against aggressive and pokey comps at bot lane.. Twitch needs crit yet he still rushes BotRK and afterwards gets the critical chance. It delays the the critical strike power spike but allows you to get the power spike from simply getting a BotRK.. You save way more gold by simply rushing BotRK and with that money you can get daggers andor boots.. And there is a power spike when you get Blade of the Ruined King.. Jinx isnt a duelist neither is Twitch to be honest. The funny part is that the active isnt specifically for dueling. It allows you to peel for yourself and allows you to catch up enemies. Not necessarily for dueling.. Power spikes happen despite the items as well. BotRK offers a power spike IE  Runaans Zeal offer a power spike as well. Different phases but power spikes both nonetheless.,leagueofjinx,dgfh3n3,1,t5_2yr5r
