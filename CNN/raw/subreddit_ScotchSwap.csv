5368526,0,t3_3ogj4e,Hey guys I was lucky enough to receive  samples from umfpark. Six!!!Included with those samples was a handwritten note informing me that all of the samples are straight bourbon and that they each share two additional variables in common. Knowing that they are all Bourbon does narrow it down quite a bit but I felt pressure knowing that information. Ive done  reviews on rscotch but only around a dozen on rbourbon. Simply put I find bourbons harder to distinguish from one another than scotch whiskies. Its much harder to tell the difference between a high rye and a low rye mashbill than it is to know the difference between a heavily peated Laphroaig and a candysweet Glendronach. Ive been trying to get better at Bourbon reviews and I used these mystery samples as an opportunity to do that!Anyways pictures here reviews below Sample Color CopperNose Minty soap. Im used to this note in Bourbon but its not usually the first thing to hit me. Chalky some citrus light orange vanilla caramel maybe some brown sugar.Taste Bolder than the nose strong oak presence although its not a bad thing. Dried dark fruit citrus candy some light spice maybe rye? Chocolate is present creamier later.Finish Dry some spice lingering oak. Score Thoughts Very pleasant if unthreatening. Id have to guess that its around  proof. Not sure what Bourbon it might be. Could be anything honestly very possibly something Ive not had. The orange and mint threw me off early. Guess Buffalo Trace my st ever review on rbourbon.Sample Color Lighter than the last brass highlights.Nose Mellow honey lavender dry corn pale malt more light floral notes. Taste Sticky pine bright citrus later caramel corn lightly astringent late some chocolate very light all around.Finish Softly fades away not much to speak of. Score Thoughts Not bad although fairly uninteresting. Mostly likely something pf but there arent any real off notes or astringent flavors. My thought on the flavor profile was something like Jim Beam at first but it lacks those off flavors. Guess Jim Beam Black Sample Color Deep CaramelNose The boldest yet. Rich chocolate dark dried fruit musty earthy acrid oak perfume. Taste Spice that wasnt on the nose chocolate mossy oak must orange citrus later is brown sugar burnt caramel.Finish Warming medium length more oak than there was early.Score Thoughts Something a bit more interesting here. Nose mightve hinted at a higher proof but the palate seemed to feel like pf. Guess Eagle Rare ? Its been a while but the flavor profile seems similar I guess. I remember ER having more bitter oak though.Sample Color CopperNose Rich with some heat noticeable in the back. Old wood dried leather dull spice musty dark chocolate. Some tangy semisour notes that I find interesting. The oak presence is acrid but somehow not bitter. Alcohol more evident as the nose opens up never unpleasant though.Taste Cherry cola more lively spice than on the nose bright oak salted caramel dark chocolate sweet citrus candy pineapple? Later on is cool mint roasted corn brown sugar Finish Creamy chocolatey cherries. Long and warming.Score Thoughts I really really like this. Guessing aside Im really eager to find out what it is so that I can try to acquire a bottle for myself! Seems to be around pf maybe higher. Guess Old Weller  although Ive never had it.Sample Color Dark brassNose Interesting. Dank musty smoke Id almost imagine Im smelling peat if I didnt know that this was a bourbon. Now more vegetal old mossy oak black pepper hot sauce? Whats happening inside my nose right now? Ethanol honey strawberries. Taste Sweeter on the tongue. Honey vanilla floral notes very light spice saltwater taffy crisp green apples more pepper. Bitter oak soapy alcohol strawberries again rock candy butterscotch dry astringent late.Finish Very clean soap again short.Score Thoughts Nose was pretty...interesting. Taste started off good but didnt end well  and the finish was very disappointing. I have no idea on this one.Guess JW Dant BiB? Total Guess.Sample Color Orangeish copperNose Acrid oak oranges mint lots of mint. Other dark red fruit bitter campfire ashes figs rye bread oatmeal.Taste Similar to the nose. Some orange and other red fruit chocolate the oak presence is dark bitter acrid. Also some bright golden wheat I didnt notice before very reminiscent of a good wheat beer. Minty still especially later. Finish Slightly creamy chocolate orange mint. Medium length.Score Thoughts All the orange I was getting early made me think of Bulleit Bourbon but I dont recall so much mint from that one. I dont have any other solid ideas though.Guess Bulleit BourbonSo umfpark said that these whiskies all shared two things in common besides all being straight bourbons. What could those things be? Same distillery? Same mashbill? Same proof? Same age? I have no idea. I tried to not be distracted by that and just go with my senses. Im extremely curious to find out the results!,ScotchSwap,cvxw103,3,t5_2sp4o

10201304,0,t3_5m1538,Sorry if these suggestions seem obvious but when I first started swapping I had zero experience shipping anything and had to learn these the hardexpensive way.Create an account with UPS and FEDEX and print your own labels up. Its significantly cheaper than getting the label made and paying at a shipping store. You can just set the weight at  lbs if its a bottle or some samples the rate is the same for anything under  lbs. And check the rates for both carriers sometimes one is cheaper than the other depending on where youre shipping.They dont just charge by weight but by box dimensions too. So use the smallest box possible to safely send the bottle. Ive been good so far with a layer of bubble wrap and a thin layer of peanuts.Rates can vary by where youre sending tofrom also.,ScotchSwap,dc0di2s,1,t5_2sp4o

11405411,0,t3_62ppor,.utke was an early swap with me. Gave me a ton of awesome info on Whiskey selections he made for me and probably provided way over the value of the cigars I traded for them I never really looked. There was definitely a lot of harder to find drams there. Really great guy makes the new swappers feel super welcome. I feel like hes one of the more engaging members of the subreddit always willing to chime in with something positive to add to the conversation. ,ScotchSwap,dfosepr,2,t5_2sp4o
