1113726,0,t1_chum29r,Well everything in Gatineau is to an extent suburban there arent a lot of places where you can get a community vibe. You best bets if you dont have a family and a super straight and boring life is either Vieux Hull which is a little dirty and sketchy or Val Ttrault which is less so. It also has the added benefit of having a decent riverfront and access to the Gatineau Park and bike paths. ,Gatineau,chuw0yf,1,t5_2s3ac

Its super strange  its like you cant hit the IP ... when youre plugged into the Videotron network but its no problem with the coax out. I dont know why they would care frankly.,Gatineau,cl3291w,1,t5_2s3ac
4590758,0,t3_3dw2td,Authentic mexican can be found at the bistro mexicana  or some number on Principale.Les vilains pcheurs is apparently worth the heavier check.On front of them is Mulligan an average caf in a fabulous setting.Im not sure id they serve it during the week but la boulangerie Les deux Frres offers a mean pizza to go.more like delicious toppings on heavenly bread than actual pizza.Be sure to always finish with the best gelato in GO from Le Cassis.,Gatineau,ct99dxb,2,t5_2s3ac

Note that your rentallease agreement may only be written in French and you may not ready to tackle a long French language legal document right now if one of the reasons you want to move to the Quebec side of the river is to learn French.,Gatineau,cwu2tgb,1,t5_2s3ac
5809234,0,t1_cwooqr8,Its interesting you had such a negative experience  I currently live only a few blocks away from where you must have lived although on the other side of Maisonneuve from the McDonalds and I find it pretty quiet. It probably depends on who your neighbors are though and unfortunately you cant do a lot about who people lease to. I agree about the quality of construction being very hit or miss in this area. I guess my point is the best advice for OP would be to check out the neighborhood where they are considering a place at different times especially at night and then decide if the environment is what they are willing to live with.,Gatineau,cxh6v8u,1,t5_2s3ac

Pis le lait est pas mal tout au mme prix sauf si tachte le Sealtest qui est significativement moins cher ou le Lactantia microfiltr sans lactose etc. qui est significativement plus cher. Et for the record le vin est moins de  la bouteille.,Gatineau,d46ep6i,1,t5_2s3ac
