6348818,0,t1_czb5rvf,Ah sorry didnt understood your question correctly. Best of luck finding relevant articles then.,redis,czbag5o,1,t5_2r18v
6459608,0,t1_czndjdc,gt This is trivial. Id use a client library to manage the data migration youll save yourself a lot of headaches.Redis cant do it itself? There is no commands for updating database index?gt Again the number of databases you define here will have no performance impact whatsoever.I know but keeping the data on the th database would feel awkward when I seperate databases into different instances. It could be located on database . That way it can run fine on default redis.conf. Otherwise I would need to specify database index to be more than  which would be an extra task. It may save some future headaches.I may rethink this if there is no easy way to update database indexes.,redis,czngt3x,1,t5_2r18v

7552034,0,t1_d2xdyd9,One can only hope but its nice to know your boundaries for what could soon be catering data to billions of users ,redis,d30mpb7,1,t5_2r18v
9424661,0,t3_58tm9d,Depending on your linux build you need to config your init.d file to be startup able. For example I am running CentOS so I add this to the top of the init script.codechkconfig     codeThen you run this command to enable it for bootup.chkconfig redis on,redis,d9an2qm,1,t5_2r18v
10278839,0,t3_5n6is2,Yep thats basically correct.While RLEC adheres to the clusters spec the underlying implementation is indeed different from that of the open source cluster. We use proxies and dedicated cluster management processes to operate a cluster of what are essentially standalone Redis instances btw these processes use an internal Redis database for sharing configuration data and such .The reason for having two cluster implementations is timing  the open source cluster became available in v whereas Redis Labs had clusters running in production a couple of years before the GA and our tech was developed to support that need.If you have any questions about RLEC please dont hesitate to approach our support at redislabs dot com team. ,redis,dc95v7x,2,t5_2r18v
