2235591,0,t1_clns4x3,Everything Martenz says.I cant recommend Long War highly enough if you want a tougher campaign. In the Vanilla game I found it hard to lose squad members even newbies unless I made silly choices or blundered into something I never dealt with before. Long Wars features such as the large accuracy penalty for going on overwatch and everything Martenz listed make even Light engagements with the aliens a test of nerves and maneuvering. This is especially true in the early stages of the campaign because of the most interesting feature of all fatigue.After each engagement regardless of whether or not an XCom soldier was injured they will be fatigued for  days. This means that should another abduction occur within that period you will have to send a squad of soldiers completely different from the previous one. It goes beyond fatigue though. Soldiers who survive a battle after being hit will be wounded sometimes gravely. This can mean anything from  weeks to nearly a full month of recovery time! My worst experience yet with the mod saw my primary team almost completely taken out of operation for  days. There were about  or  engagements in that time all of which saw  KIA or worse as one team of recruits after another were brought in to fill the gaps and lost almost as quickly.Unfortunately it is a single player mod and makes online play unworkable because of all the modifications. Aside from that its fantastic.Long War Chrysalids...I tense up at the keyboard whenever I see them now.,christianitygaming,clnzwxd,3,t5_2y21o
