Too bad the Melody Bottle isnt wearing a pair of Water Shoes. I suppose I could just fish in the middle of battle though. Funny how sometimes asking the question actually makes you realize the answers right in front of you the whole time. Still it might give others pause for thought. Of course that depends on the question How long do items remain underwater? Are they still there when you leave and return? ,runefactory,cjxl2zg,0,t5_2tkdl

6081561,0,t3_3yuodn,If youre broke at the beginning of the game trade some play coins with Arthur for money you may have to finish more requests to unlock this and then use that money to buy as many turnip seeds as you can. Ship the turnips you get more money that way than from cooking them first. If youre broke a lot you might be trying to buy gear from Bado instead of crafting. Work through the tutorial requests to get a hammer and unlock forging and crafting and make your own armor and accessories instead of buying them Bado overcharges way too much!,runefactory,cygrwe7,3,t5_2tkdl
7174061,0,t3_4dpjo4,You can get warning of an approaching typhoon by talking to the villagers too. Porco usually mentions a typhoon to me at least  days before it happens. That way you have more time to throw down wettable powder.,runefactory,d1tmgjq,1,t5_2tkdl
8164271,0,t3_4r043a,Sometimes I get annoyed trying to tame monsters  like if I need a Buffamoo and it takes like  recipe breads  milk and an antidote grass to get em. I think my favorite thing to do is craft nifty items and sell them for all the money at festivals.  Raven is my home girl with her shop of awesome.  ,runefactory,d4y2yst,2,t5_2tkdl

9448928,0,t1_d9dpotl,Id say so but the first one is easily the most difficult and slowest in the series. What carries over into Frontier is the main character and most of the bachelorettes.,runefactory,d9dpujy,2,t5_2tkdl
9620120,0,t1_d9ylyd9,For Margaret its probably the hair also compared to all the other bachelorettes she looks rather average.I agree with Alicia but hey at least she was useful and easy to befriend. Though her outfit is gaudy and awful too flashy for a farmer.Sophia is cute and funny opposite talk wouldve been better if only she did it and was a curse shed be impossible to deal without the red text irlJames...if we ignore the sister complex and exgirlfriend...I think I prefer him over the other two guys. ,runefactory,d9yvlzi,2,t5_2tkdl
