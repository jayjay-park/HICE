Basically I think Gawkers overall editorial stance was its biggest strength but also its ultimate weakness and eventual undoing.

The only strictly premiumonly content is sketched work and outtakes and for art patreons sometimes very high resolution and .psd versions of the works suitable for printing. That way theres a reward for supporting you see behind the scenes but no one who is a fan of the art is denied content because of cost. For them they could do the timed releases and then have the only strictly premiumonly content be things like the solo episodes and things like recordings of the live shows. Theyre already generally in this where the premium episodes tend to be things like their movie analyses and such that didnt fit in the main line of commentary but stuff like episode  is just so incredibly good and insightful that I think it is actually important that I can link it to people and get them to listen. ,ChapoTrapHouse,dc727ux,9,t5_3ezs3

10481392,0,t3_5q190h,The beginning of this captures all the frustration with Twitter that made me leave it lately.  Twitter banishes nuance and the character limit makes it so people regularly misword or misinterpret things a sterling example of this was the KenzidorJacobin dustup where Left Twitter engaged in a vile weekslong civil war over a people misunderstanding each others motives.  Also due to the structure of followers people tend to preach to the choir.  This leads to a situation where everything revolves around owning people you disagree with usually by digging up old outof context tweets to make said person look like a hypocrite or a sociopath.  Empathy nuance and getting where the other guy comes from are all thrown under the bus in favor of constantly being tools to win the approval of your niche.  It can be fun and exhilarating beyond a doubt to say shit on Eric Garland but in the long run it is bad for political discourse as a whole and not good or healthy for us either especially when it is a total rando were shitting on.

10494628,0,t1_dcxjk3a,Im not an expert at all but is it really fair to say he gave up on socialism? He was certainly strongly opposed to Stalin but he remained in the Labour party when that still meant something until the end of his life as far as I know. In The Lion and the Unicorn which he wrote during WWII hes pretty clearly still a strong socialist although he was never dogmatic or orthodox in that. On the other hand he was so disenchanted with the USSR around the time of his death I could see someone arguing that he was kinda doing a Christopher Hitchens and changing sides. I value Orwell quite a bit. He was clearly very racist and homophobic but The Road to Wigan Pier and some of his essays are excellent. I think Animal Farm and  were good and relevant for the world of the s and s but extremely illfitting to the present moment definitely an overused vapid comparison as you say. ,ChapoTrapHouse,dcxocv4,12,t5_3ezs3

10595475,0,t1_dd8c40o,Eh I do think there are definitional issues worth insisting on. The late th and early th centuries had a lot of wishywashiness about socialism as compatible with keeping the same old capitalist imperialism but tossing a few extra table scraps to imperialistnation workers which was part of how so many people didnt find it selfevidently absurd for the term to be picked up by groups like the Nazis. To me socialism isnt truly descriptive unless it implies an economic system built from the ground up on collectively organized principles not just slathering a quick coat of leftish paint over an otherwise capitalistimperialist framework. But youre right that getting Americans to think and speak more like the rest of the world does about these things will be an uphill battle and Ill take whatever victories we can get.In many countries the same kind of workingclassoriented economic policies within a broadly capitalist framework that Americans call liberal are denoted with the adjective social so for example what we call the welfare state will be called the social state or more ominously apologetics for nationalism by ostensible leftists are derided as social chauvinism in that sense social democracy seems like the obviously appropriate term for people like Sanders. Alternately the social deviation from classical liberalism could be understood as social liberalism but by American standards using that term for the specifically economic agenda of welfare states and so on would seem even more confusing.,ChapoTrapHouse,dd8ub5y,1,t5_3ezs3

The lust of the English softleft for the EU is almost entirely explained by the fact that they all think of themselves as intellectuals who dont have to work with their hands or ultimately wont have to work with their hands if their plan works out. Spending a life competing for work with labor migrants is not anything theyre anticipating its just a stage that theyre passing though if they have worked at a low wage job their international workmates are colorful and interesting and make them feel worldly. Just like in the US.The hardleft defends the EU because theyre communists and they think that an institution like the EU is an ideal form whose only flaw is that it has yet to be taken over by Communists. The Scots support the EU as a counterbalance to London. The softleft are the problem that is propping up the Tories right now they just hate Brexit because they want to feel fancy and they dont want to embolden fascists. Literally the word embolden is the entire argument and they expected Corbyn to be able to sell that to people who work for a living and resent him for not making them coherent.If the Tories dont screw up the destruction of Labour by the Blairite consultantocracy will drive that softleft into the Tories arms as they age and the workers into a coherent far rightwing party that draws more support than Labour  Tories win for a very long time trip and fall in a horrendous way country taken over by fascists.If the Tories do screw up that softleft will end up in the traditional home of the centrist loser the Lib Dems  Tories win for a long time farceNeil farceKinnock spends  years calling them heartless as the voters drift back to Labour from the Lib Dems Tories get tired of winning by becoming openly sociopathic and running candidates with severe brain damage and Hapsberg lip Labour wins with policies to the right of May.,ChapoTrapHouse,dgfgji7,1,t5_3ezs3

11663475,0,t3_66ejzg,gtHypocrisy is meaningless and ineffective as a political weapon or liability now.This is true. Its also terrifying and it was weird when I saw Amber Frost espousing the idea that hypocrisy isnt that big a deal.You cant push people based on your morals. You have to push people based on their morals. Maybe thatll make them become similar to your morals but the point is you cant make someone feel bad if youre accusing them of something they dont feel bad about. So when people defuse racism they dont just say youre racist they tap into empathy Christian charity and shared humanity  things that a racist probably believes in but simply buries when it comes to race. In short calling someone out on their inconsistent values to try to push them into becoming more consistent  in your direction of course.If hypocrisy doesnt matter then nothing matters. If hypocrisy doesnt matter theres no way to change peoples minds. If hypocrisy doesnt matter theres no such thing as a genuine moral code  just a series of vague feelings and reactions.So whats left at this point?,ChapoTrapHouse,dgi2iuz,5,t5_3ezs3
