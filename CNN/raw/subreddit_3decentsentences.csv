9008398,0,t3_53mfql,This song has a very particular mood  I really really like how forward your lyrics are in the mix and I like the raspiness of them and the change between higher notes and the occasional lower note.The dynamics of the song are also wellexecuted  the I dont wanna slave away sections are noticeably louder without being too loud which gives them an extra punch that would be lacking if they werent mixed so well.The instrumentation  particularly the drums as theyre my favourite  are very wellpieced together fitting with the build and release of the song. Good job!,3decentsentences,d7uo2m9,3,t5_3geeu
