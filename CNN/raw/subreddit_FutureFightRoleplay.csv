7407389,0,t1_d2jcypb,Im not sure this is what I want.  Im not always even sure what I want for breakfast in the morning.  Thats part of the problem.I lifted the mask showing Clint my face.  I really think wed be better off at the very least coming up with a licensing system with like classes and a mentoring program.  Seriously.  Captain Bad Life Decisions right here I said indicating myself.  No education on having powers.  No father figures worth a damn.  No idea whats going on in the world.  Pair that up with a lot of ability to destroy and very little knowledge of what to do with it except follow my own will.  The world got really really lucky I didnt go the way of Doom.  I might not have my own nation but Im pretty sure Stark Industries if it was its own country would be probably around th in GDP.  Theres a lot of good I can do in the world...and just as much bad if Id set my mind to it.  I stood in front of Clint Barton the man Id trusted with my life multiple times palms forward fingers pointed to the ground.  Granted the conciliatory gesture probably would have worked better if it didnt point repulsors at him but Ive always shown my nerves most with my hands and the thing to do to hide that is to keep those hands moving.  You tell me whether finding some degree of limitation on the exercise of our power is a good thing or not.  Do we really want to have more innocent people bearing the weight of our inability to make good decisions?durollme,FutureFightRoleplay,d2k672b,2,t5_3ea87
