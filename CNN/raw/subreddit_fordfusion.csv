Buy the oem off eBay from freeway fordGet ur part number from the dealership. Make sure its the correct part number bc they have many different options and some have bypass switches. U get an aftermarket system and it may work but a warning light will pop up shortly after. I installed mine its a plug and play oem mins  had the dealership sync it  but they did it free bc my car has been in the shop for  days in the last  months.

7828002,0,t3_4mdpdp,What is your budget? Im a  year old college student and bought my  SE on ebay for  grand about  months ago. BUY SALVAGE. Many people will disagree with me on this but if you do your homework and make sure the car is good. You essentially are getting a car that has BRAND NEW parts for sometimes literally half the price. Im not sure what the MSRP is on a  ford fusion se with k miles is but Id imagine its probably . Literally the only problem my car has had is that the back right window is unable to be controlled by the driver control panel its very possible this was a side effect of the wreck but on my last car which was a jeep cherokke clean title it had the same problem so idk. Other than that the car runs fucking flawlessly and I got an amazing deal on it. The only true issue with salvage titles if you buy the right one is trying to resell it tbh but Ill have this baby for another  yrs I bet so who cares. And stay away from water damaged salvaged titles if you do decide to take my advice those are WAY to risky. ,fordfusion,d3vxn0f,2,t5_2u6bd

8333264,0,t1_d5j7m6d,In fact American vehicles require more special tools than European vehicles. And our tools cost more too.

8643251,0,t1_d6lzxes,Well first you gotta buy a lot of lighting parts. You can purchase them all from theretrofitsource.com. The main components are acme led strips morimoto mini h . bi xenon projectors k hid bulbs ballastscomputers and a lot of wiring. All this costs about .Then you can get risky by using your factory headlights or go the safe route by buying some. This can run you about . Then you bake the headlights to soften the permaseal glue and separate the lens. This is extremely difficult to do and then you have to remove all the plasticky stuff which literally took me  hours at least to do.Then you swap out your factory components and mount the LEDs and wire it all together. You can paint the internals as well.Then you put new butyl glue in and put it back in the oven to reseal.It is a lengthy process to DIY but well worth the time and money. You can see more at night and you stand out more during the day as well as it looks better.This is the second revision of these headlights. Previously it was all blacked out and had a tube led. I was selling those for  shipped but decided not to because I can make it work. These are the outcome. I may sell these for  in a couple months when I upgrade to better lights haha.,fordfusion,d6m0m3r,3,t5_2u6bd

9543982,0,t3_5blyyf,No such thing. The tire compounds themselves do not have the necessary elasticity to handle C swings in temperatures. You end up with really soft tires that wear exceptionally fast in the heat or hard tires that become solid pucks in the cold.If your going to be driving in icesnow get snow tires and swap them between seasons. If you want to save some money get a second pair of winter rims.Mounting rims is cheaper then balancing tires.,fordfusion,d9phrqz,0,t5_2u6bd
