4218312,0,t3_397sf0,Hi there these were from an online vendor and I wasnt entirely sure about what I was getting. These were sold as Trichocereus Pachanoi cuttings. Only one of these has  radial lobes for the distinctive pointed star crosssection which I thought was an identifying feature of t. pachanoi. Also the spines seem a bit smaller than Id have expected. Several of the pics include a soup can or quarter for scale reference. Please help me figure out whether Ive actually been sold an active cacti or if Ive been ripped off.Thanks!,mescaline,cs12jsh,1,t5_2qlxl

Honestly if I had the choice to do both I would do both not at the same time.  STP was unique and I liked it. Duration was long so exhausted after words.  Mescaline on the other hand I would probably do first and aquire enough for bigger doses. Its not very often I get the chance to partake much these days. ,mescaline,dcjoxbl,3,t5_2qlxl
