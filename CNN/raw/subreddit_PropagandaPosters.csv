Right? gt You didnt answer my question although I think since you think suicide bombings in coffee houses are justified if your answer wont really matter.Youre dumb as fuck and you lack reading comprehension skills as well. Shouldnt be too surprised.Regardless show me where I justified explicitly suicide bombings. Is explaining the rationale behind them that the bombings of soft targets were in reaction to the wanton murder of dozens if not hundreds of Palestinians over the s and into the Second Intifada and also the seeming indifference of the Israeli street which knew very well what was going on and really couldnt give a fuck for the most part?gt Have you ever been to Israel?

Conservatives use these voters to get their policies through. The rich get richer the poor stay poor and think the imbalance of money goes to other poor people who are Other immigrants etc. Its Labours failing to call Daily Mail etc out on their shit and have proverbial balls. Now when someone promises the same thing but not by a nod and a wink like the conservatives but by outright stating it like Ukip its populism. And rightwing populism isnt condemned by what it says but by being cheered on by lots of voters. Beautifully consevatives and Labour can call these people out for being stupid and dangerous all the while being complicit in their existence by not giving a shit about these people in the first place.And so the circle of dumb continues.

There was never going to be a civil war ya idiot.gtI dont condone him giving so much power to the oligarchs. But he had to do something.Like maybe making sure the oligarchs dont rise up? The only reason they exist today is because Yeltsins government turned a blind eye to what they did during privatization.gtNonsense. Russia was going to experience all those problems no matter what. You dont the soviet union and walk away from it without any pain. Nonsense. The birth rate plummeted and the death rate rose immensely after the fall of the Soviet Union. It was pretty stable beforehand. Then Yeltsin came instituted his reforms ruined the country and everything went to shit.gtHe didnt suppress democracy. Without yeltsin putin wouldnt even have power. Im sorry? Just because he bent over to the West doesnt mean he was a nice guy. He shelled the Parliament because they wouldnt do what he wanted them to do.gtDumbest thing Ive ever read. He inherent shit  russia in early s was complete shit  and he saved it. You act like he took a great nation and then suppressed democracy etc. No he took a country which was somewhat stable USSR made it collapse and had it down until he had to resign and Putin took power. Russia only saw growth under Putins rule under Yeltsin it was nothing but one huge economic recession. The dude was awful.gtHe was able to keep the oligarchs in check because of yeltsin. Do you know who putin was in the early s? A NOBODY. Yeltsin brought in him and made him president and gave him political protection against the oligarchs. You think putin managed to beat the oligarchs by himself? Yes yes I do. Given Yeltsins questionable history with the oligarchs he himself made Putin was without doubt the one who finally reigned them in.Lets see what is actually said about Yeltsin.gtDue to the method of privatization a good deal of the national wealth fell into the hands of a small group of oligarchs. Much of the Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption inflation economic collapse and enormous political and social problems that affected Russia and the other former states of the USSR. Within the first few years of his presidency many of Yeltsins political supporters turned against him and Vice President Alexander Rutskoy denounced the reforms as economic genocide.Yeltsin is responsible for the rise of the oligarchs check. He did not reign them in he did not hold them off he simply turned a blind eye to their plundering.gtOngoing confrontations with the Supreme Soviet climaxed in the October  Russian constitutional crisis in which Yeltsin illegally ordered the dissolution of the parliament which then attempted to remove him from office. The military eventually sided with Yeltsin and besieged and shelled the Russian White House resulting in the deaths of  people. Yeltsin then scrapped the existing constitution temporarily banned political opposition and deepened his economic experimentation.He suppressed democracy check. Yet for some reason the West turned a blind eye to this. Guess why? He was their boy who let the companies in to use Russias natural resources.gteltsin left office widely unpopular with the Russian population. By some estimates his approval ratings when leaving office were as low as .Yes he was such a great guy! Absolutely EVERYONE hated him but he was actually good!TLDR Youre an idiot. Yeltsin pretty much singlehandedly brought about the rise of the oligarchs then did absolutely nothing to reign them in. He was drunk half the time and left office with an approval rating of as low as . He plunged the country into an economic depression on the scale of the  depression. The demographics absolutely plummeted from the Soviet Union levels. He destroyed democracy and shelled the Parliament when it opposed his blatant power grab. Yet for whatever reason you keep insisting hes a good guy. Is it just because he bent over and let the West do whatever they want? You decide.,PropagandaPosters,chqxo6j,-3,t5_2rm3n

2622390,0,t1_cn03sej,You make a good point. But I think there is a reason the poster uses the word folk people and not nation nation especially considering the atmosphere in Europe during this time. I think it is important that the most accurate translation should always be sought when dealing with propaganda as we dont know what reasons lay behind the creators decisions on what words to use. Either way I dare say they did not leave it to chance.I have my own reflectionsThe word nation doesnt seem to evoke the same emotions as the word folk does in the Swedish language. The word folk is used in this propaganda because it appeals passionately in a romantic sense that the rational word nation simply does not.Another reason may be found in that the Swedes often refer to the Finnish people as brdrafolk which would translate into something like brotherhood people. This points to the shared history and relative friendly relations that Finns and Swedes shared since the end of the Viking age and thus before any modern definitions were established. I therefore agree that the word people is most definitely a better and more accurate translation.,PropagandaPosters,cn0vu07,2,t5_2rm3n

A counterargument to that would be that if thats the case a person who spent their entire life doing good works would go to Hell while a murderer who accepted Christ before execution go to Heaven. Flight  illustrates the argument and does nothing with it. The couple who spent  years to help the poor in Africa are tossed to Hell for not having the right beliefs while a murderer who accepted Christ goes to Heaven. Another one is The Execution A counterargument to the idea that Christ died for our sins could be that this is like executing an innocent person instead of a criminal and letting the criminal to go free. The comic illustrates this and essentially says Yes its like that. Maybe Chick is a secret atheist?,PropagandaPosters,cr6oe5c,18,t5_2rm3n

5008702,0,t1_cupm0le,Many people confuse the EU with its Member States perhaps because they think that the EU is a federal arrangement as unitary as the US or perhaps out of some other thing.It was Italy who had dealings with Gaddafi about human traffic from Libyan coasts though I dont know about paying billions. The EU also has zero laws about border controls between Member States and nonMember States  those border controls are in the hands of the national governments.Im having a problem with why European nations alone are being blamed for this. The Arab and Turkish nations that surround Syria and through which the Syrian refugees are passing are pushing them out and not helping them all so that they are forced to turn to illegal human traffickers who will take all their wealth so that maybe if they dont run off with their money they help them make a dangerous journey across the Eastern Mediterranean or across Turkey into Europe. Why is a dead child on a Turkish coast used politically to blame the EU? If it werent the tragedy that it is it would be very silly.A Syrian family pays an illegal trafficker all their money in order to cross illegally on a rickety boat from Turkey or Lebanon to Greece or Italy. The boat is over packed it malfunctions on the way and sinks with all its passengers. How is this the EUs fault even if the EU had antiimmigration laws which it doesnt?The only way the EU or European nations could avoid these deaths is if they set up camps in other nations in North Africa or the Middle East to process immigrants there and then transport them safely themselves.,PropagandaPosters,cupqkif,6,t5_2rm3n

They sent it out to everybody although children have to be discounted so its more than  of those surveyed.So all those people felt like answering these questions is a legitimate discourse  Did you know that economic migrants cross the Hungarian border illegally and that recently the number of immigrants in Hungary has increased twentyfold? We hear different views on the issue of immigration. There are some who think that economic migrants jeopardise the jobs and livelihoods of Hungarians. Do you agree? There are some who think that mismanagement of the immigration question by Brussels may have something to do with increased terrorism. Do you agree with this view? Would you support the Hungarian Government in the introduction of more stringent immigration regulations in contrast to Brussels lenient policy? Do you agree with the government that instead of allocating funds to immigration we should support Hungarian families and those children yet to be born?And you could answer in nuanced ways to these nuanced questions mostly like I agree  I kind of agree  I disagree. A letter accompanies the questionaire Economic migrants cross our borders illegally and while they present themselves as asylumseekers in fact they are coming to enjoy our welfare systems and the employment opportunities our countries have to offer.Edit Just to be clear this is all fantasy. Hungary has almost  immigration. Nobody in their right mind would want to leech on the glorious Hungarian welfare system and employment opportunities lol. Hungarians are emigrating by the thousands every year and the refugees only pass through to the West. Its just the government that insists to calling people illegal immigrants  who are not really illegal according to international law and  whose only wish once they get into Hungary is to get out on the other side. ,PropagandaPosters,cv5m4ve,2,t5_2rm3n

5384945,0,t1_cvzyqyy,my understandings of the comic  your points will keep up with your points I think its not about saying that Siria was peaceful before USISIS but just saying that it was there like a somewhat regular place. Things were happening but those things are not the issue in question the question I assume is only about the correlation between the  factors ISIS US and Siria. Yep I agree. Its probably to make a clear correlation between the US and terrorism. I think the inanimation of ISIS is to state on how its manipulated by the US media? Governament? Both?. I assume the author means to give the idea that ISIS will exist as far as the US intent to and will be where it is needed. Yep your though correlate to my point above I believe. I dont think its batshit insane comic. Its a comic and its the pov of the author. And the motives arent questioned in the comic indeed.

6093834,0,t1_cyi75n7,While her being on the cover is most likely true certain parts of her story are not which has led to some controversy when first publicised.There never was a perfect Aryan baby contest. In fact theres not a single piece of evidence or photo from such an obviously propagandaridden contest entwined with nationalsocialism and eugenetics. Plus in the early years after  loads of businesses didnt necessarily cease dealing with Jewish customers or simply couldnt due to for example financial reasons. The photo was taken in a studio from someone named JolHeinzelmann notable for post and greeting cards and simple photographs. What most likely happened is that the editors of Sonne ins Haus needed some picturescouldnt get these themselveshad a strict deadline and simply asked the studio to provide these with both parties not knowing the child was Jewish and acting without knowlegde of the Taft family. The story is not new either. Taft originally talked about it during an interview in  but no other sources are present about her story. Other elements such as stating that Goebbels personally selected the picture have zero evidence as well besides being an improbable claim and being the winner of an Aryan beauty contest while having dark hair and eyes seems vague. Despite that however we cant deny that she is probably the women in the picture. Ultimately it mainly feels like a story with a basis in reality and gradually becoming a family myth.,PropagandaPosters,cyib0xi,16,t5_2rm3n

6684045,0,t1_d0an6vx,My argument was towards men feeling left behind or forgotten by the system. I used feminism as an example to illustrate one of the ways men lost their voice or power in the system. I dont have the time to find the information on how some of those sources can be attributed to towards a system that unfairly gave women more money in divorce and more women were granted the custody of the children which gave them more access to support from the system through welfarehousingchild support payments etc. This could also be used as a reason why women couldnt go through with suicide having children that relied on them but men not feeling they are needed in the childs life could commit suicide easier. There is studies on how mothers manipulate children to not go with the father and turn them against them and with the added backing of the courts sytem gives them the leverage over men. These are just hypothesis of mine and dont advocate them to be  truth. There is no denying that men and womens roles have been changing though. ,PropagandaPosters,d0aot2w,-2,t5_2rm3n

6761765,0,t1_d0iny1z,Im a NatSoc so Ill throw my two pennies in on this one.I am a NationalSocialist who identifies that the racial and antisemitic aspects of the NSDAPs platform were primarily means to gain voters i.e. what Trumps doing right now and a symptom of the times i.e. Americas own eugenics programs. I believe in the concept of Ein Reich Ein Volk Ein Fhrer but my definition of the term volk is slightly different. To me it doesnt matter if youre black yellow white or jewish if I ask you what are you? and you say an American and not a LatinoAmerican or AfricanAmerican or IrishAmerican youre kosher. Putting something before American shows a divide they consider themselves to be a very particular form of American. Thats bullshit to quote FDR the time has come to declare yourself American or traitor. Im an American of Irish and German descent but what comes first is that I am an AMERICAN. If America decides to invade Germany or Ireland it wont create any kind of faltering in my loyalties to my nation.The appeal is in the unity of it all. The entire population united for the sake of benefiting the state which benefits the population of the state in return. Ein Reich Ein Volk.There are other aspects that I find agreeable. The idea of the workers controlling the means of production is asinine in my opinion. What was originally planned and in some cases actually set up was a council within factories made up of hypothetical time!  members.  of those council members are elected by the workers of the factory. Another  of those members are designated by the companycorporation that is using the factory which is state owned and companycorporationleased to create its product. The last member is a representative of the state. In Germanys case it would have been a member of the NSDAP or one of the offshoot organizations such as the RLM in charge of producing aircraft. The idea was that this council controlled the means of production with the state representative acting as a tiebreaker if one was required and speaking in the interests of the state.What initially drew me into FascismNatSoc was that I didnt belong anywhere. I was some punk anarchist kid who was just pissed off at the world and was going nowhere fast. I met some people who encouraged me who straightened me out got me off the dope and pointed me in the right direction. They gave me literature such as Mein Kampf ignore the first half its all masturbatory drivel the second half is where he actually discusses National Socialism as an ideology booklets and the like of Joseph Gbbels and other such highranking members of the NSDAP who helped form Hitlers dream into a reality. Was I an antisemitic racist? Oh you bet your fucking bottom dollar I was. Then I did what any good farright extremist does I joined the military. Then I went to Afghanistan and lived in extremely close confines with jews and hispanics and blacks and we had to depend on each other when shit got hot. I still had my core political beliefs but I had stripped away the racist bullshit. And this has gone on for faaaaaar longer than I meant it to.,PropagandaPosters,d0iq2la,9,t5_2rm3n

7233770,0,t1_d202r5l,gt Right I think I get it now in simple terms God was bodiless then assumed flash as Christ and after the resurrection he went bodiless again.Not exactly. God in Trinity was  and remains  bodiless. God the Son the Second Person of the Trinity assumed human flesh and has retained it although He was never absent on High i.e. He was never confined solely to His human body. He ascended with His body.gt And this sets Christ version Im sure there is a better word to describe it instead of version but Im blanking out here... of the God from the rest of versions of the God in Christianity. Right? Thank you for taking time to explain. That point from my comment is indeed invalid and you didnt contradict your self.What I mean to say is that while God Himself does not change the Incarnation of the Logos the Second Person of the Trinity changes our humanitys relationship with God completely. That is what has changed God assumed flesh as Jesus Christ. So before His Nativity God was entirely bodiless while afterward He now has taken on created form.Now as for the other versions I suppose we could say Persons here of God its interesting you should mention that because technically the argument could be made that all of God is made incarnate through Christ. Christ says Anyone who hath seen Me hath seen the Father. But thats some deep theology we dont have to get into I just though it bore mentioning for the purposes of clarification.gt I still dont think that it was a cheap potshot as you said. Clearly bible says that the God is in heavens and majority of other monotheist or polytheist religions have the same statements. Bible and other religious literature made a lot of verifiable statements which were over the centuries contradicted by science all of which were explained away as allegories or symbolism.See this is your conjecture. It isnt like someone came to the Church and said Ha! There is an atmosphere and then above that is space! Where is God? And then there was a scramble. The theologians and philosophers of  years ago werent stupid and they understood the nature of created and uncreated bodied and bodiless things. Even the angels are described as bodiless and God is described as a spirit disclaimer incomplete description not to be taken out of context. The assumption that they literally mean in the sky when they talk about the heavens is more a leap on our part than on theirs because they simply lacked sufficient terminology to describe Heaven. So do we by the way is Heaven another plane of existence? Another dimension? Another universe? Something behind or beyond our existence? In the heavens is sufficient to say that God is beyond our physical reach which is really all that needed to be said.gt And if we go with allegories and symbolism then I would say that overall message of this poster is not Look we poped up there to check if there is God and he is not there. But its Look what science achieved over few centuries from believing that the earth was the center of the universe to freaking going to space and in all this incredible journey we didnt find a single event which would have pointed to the existence of god and as such there is no God. Of course there is not enough space on a poster and it wouldnt be an effective propoganda to have a long essay on a poster. So its much better to put an image of a sofar crowning achievement of science with a tagline There is no GodAll well and good that may very well be the message. But by the s religion just wasnt having this conversation. Its the literal definition of a strawman argument. It would be like us laughing about how witches have no real power now its not like there were witches and cauldrons running around.Edit Wow thank you for the gold.

The idea isnt to be accurate but rather to present conscientious objectors in a bad light.To give it some context the article that OP got this from discusses how the media portrayal of conscientious objectors was overwhelmingly negative but reactions to them in daytoday life were more evenly distributed. To me that sounds more like a smear campaign than the result of ignorance.,PropagandaPosters,d34i3vk,6,t5_2rm3n

7648392,0,t1_d3bjfeb,As far as I can tell its about right. But it doesnt take into account a rebate we get back about bn last year nor does it include the amount of money the UK receives in EU funding and indirect benefits.I have also seen figures from the Treasury that say UKs net contribution for  was .bn while the National Audit Office which takes into account EU money paid directly to the UK private sector calculated  to have cost .bn.So while the specific figure is disputed as there are so many factors at work  many of which are hidden  as well as there being political motives on both sides to interpret figures in a certain way most people agree that the UK pays in more than it gets out in a strictly financial sense. But then people could argue that by doing so the UK is helping countries that take more out than put in such as Poland who will then grow their economies and increase tradeinput into the EUetc. thus benefitting the UK in the future. But this argument can go on forever so Ill leave it there for now  sorry for such a long response.,PropagandaPosters,d3bkw8z,12,t5_2rm3n

Edgar Hoover called them public enemy no.  they actually had fairly reasonable aims and telling people to move over may have meant so we can get shit done rather than or we will kill you. Their aims were basically employment affordable housing access to health care stopping police brutality educational reform reparations for slavery stopping aggressive war and freedom for political prisoners. However they were different from MLK and other Christian activists by the fact that they accepted that there may be the need for violence but it was never a primary tactic.One of their main activities was providing breakfast for school children.

8236730,0,t1_d512hhr,No Franco wasnt a Fascist a murdering dictator yes but a Fascist nogtWhilst Spain was quite close with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and the association with the fascist Falange Francos Spain wasnt really fascist. Franco himself can best be called well a Francoist  his main priorities were always the consolidation of his own power from his climb to Generalisimo in the civil war to the consolidation of the fairly diverse nationalists under his own single party FET y de las JONS and the restoration of the monarchy without a monarch. His central ideology can be described as a mix of Spanish nationalism and reactionary Catholicism.gtThis involved the reestablishment of church power in Spain after it had been drastically reduced during the Second Republic over many areas of Spanish life including education and legal matters. This is a key area where Francoism differs from fascism a revolutionary element is a major part of fascist ideology whereas with Franco social policy was strictly traditionalist and reactionary based off the power of the Catholic church in Spain and similar to the s situation.gtAnother aspect that differs with fascism is the lack of a popular mass movement. In Italy the blackshirts in Germany the brownshirts  both were mass movements loyal to their leaders. In Spain the fascist mass movement was primarily made up of the blueshirts and before the war GilRobles legalist fascist CEDA of Falange. Whilst it was definitely a mass movement on the same side as Franco Francos support base was rather in the military and clergy.gtFalange itself quickly became marginalised during the war within FET y de las JONS after the death of their leader Antonio Primo de Rivera in a republican prison in  which lead to a struggle within the party leadership. As the party chaos ensued Franco the opportunist he was exploited to announce the consolidation of Falange into his own organisation citing the need for unity where they quickly became almost irrelevant.gtFranco also had ambitious ideas to restore Spain to its former imperial glory at home and overseas. This first came to fore during Francos meeting with Hitler at Hendaye in  where Franco included in his demands for entry into the war all of French Morocco and a suggestion of Portugals future seizure.gtDomestically Spanish nationalism came through with the centrality of Castillian Spanish and banning of Basque Catalan and other regional languages as well as the revocation of any autonomy they had during the Republic.Economically Spain under Franco gets its closest to traditional fascism. Initially Franco advocated for a strictly independent economy that was entirely self reliant links to the nationalism here too much similar to Hitlers ambitions for German autarky. The economy during this period also included the quite fascist single consolidated trade union the Sindicato Vertical which in theory united employers and employees in one structure disallowing independence from the state.gtThough much of this this changed after  during the Spanish Miracle sparked by the failure of the autarkic economy to rebuild the country and American promises of economic aid. This period saw the country being opened up to foreign investment and a free market introduced dramatically boosting the economy and sending it far from the fascist similarities it once had.gtSourcesgtPreston Paul.

8606954,0,t1_d6gw5qa,Oh I know. It will work next time.Regardless. I used totalitarian communism specifically to refer to the socalled communist states that have actually existed in the world. When you refer to communists outside of a political science class that is the commonly understood definition.I get that communism as a political and economic philosophy is separate from the way that it has been executed so far in the real world.Capitalism has huge flaws  basically the same flaws that drive all of human behavior. But it is a system that actually exists and can be looked at.I think it is very easy to engage in a thought exercise when you envision a society that fixes all of the flaws that exist in the real world.But I dont think communism scales well at all past a small village perhaps. It requires everyone to be on the same page and it doesnt really have a way to deal with bad actors or a way to transition from a capitalist society without the use of force.Anarchy as a political philosophy has similar problems.In both cases it is really easy to cast stones at systems that actually exist in the real world where there flaws can be examined when you are comparing them to political systems that really only exist on paper or in really small scale.,PropagandaPosters,d6hgq5u,2,t5_2rm3n

9490669,0,t1_d9iplkc,. Romania was never a part of the USSR. It was only occupied for nine months during World War II since Romania fought on the Axis side for a good part of the war.. Although Romania was a socialist state during the Cold War it was never close to being a puppet state despite being part of the Warsaw Pact. Furthermore Ceausescu took a radically independent approach as soon as he came to power  he did many things including publicly opposing the Soviets invasion of Czechoslovakia having frequent meetings with prominent American political figures and infamously declaring Romania can produce its own nukes. His doctrine was more reminiscent of nationalism rather than socialism and culturally the notion that Romania was historically apart from the Russians was introduced.Romania was in no way a Soviet puppet state despite being part of the Warsaw Pact. ,PropagandaPosters,d9ixevo,12,t5_2rm3n

9911168,0,t1_daz9k4o,My history professor this semester has said a few times that America is actually the western country with the BEST record of multicultural acceptance not because Americans are good at it but because Europeans have been so much worse.Basically his argument is that the only reason Europeans havent struggled with diversity recently is because theres no diversity to struggle with though thats starting to change with the influx of refugees. When World War Two was over most ethnicities got shoved back into their own countries one way or another or were essentially ejected altogether like the Jews and didnt have to be shitty to each other anymore. Now my professor could explain all this better than I can it made a lot more sense when he said it than I am now.Anyway I dont necessarily agree with him but I thought it was an interesting point.
