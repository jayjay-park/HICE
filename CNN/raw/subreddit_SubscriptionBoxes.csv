4826512,0,t3_3gvfib,Its been about a year since I had a Graze subscription. I currently subscribe to Naturebox and I do prefer it.On the positive side for Graze I really liked the individual portions and I never had a problem with shipping or customer service. On the negative side I am very picky and I kept getting things I didnt like even after I would mark them on the website as never send again. And I just didnt like not knowing ahead of time what I would be getting.The biggest plus for me with Naturebox is that I DO get to choose exactly what I want and I know ahead of time exactly what Im getting each month. The downside is that I have to do my own portion control which is a struggle for me. I hope this helps you choose!,SubscriptionBoxes,cu2x6ra,1,t5_2vlml

5399679,0,t1_cw1gjjt,I agree with Subscriptionista... keep track of every cent and at first only what you enjoy... because isnt that the point. I think youve got that much down though. It also is important to track shipments too. When something should come and make sure as you will find out the mail comes as it should because sometimes... it doesnt!,SubscriptionBoxes,cw1va03,1,t5_2vlml

6475567,0,t3_4405la,I created the website MonthlyBoxHub.com with the purpose of making it easier for subscription box customers to evaluate the boxes that are available so they can pick the one that fits their needs best. The site is still new so take the reviews with a grain of salt because they come from a small sample size  for example Nerd Block only has  review with a  star rating and I think it would score higher with a higher sample size. However these comments might offer some perspective you may not have considered.Loot Crate comments starsgtPROSgt lots of good exclusivesgt great community. the lootcrate team posts fun teaser videos and the magazine is usually interestinggt customer service is very good and they listen to customer feedbackgtCONSgt franchises are hit and missgt shipping and prices are way too much for anything outside of the United States starsgtLove the exclusive funko pop over all a greate box starsgtLookcrate was a great box when they first started but now i just feel like there giving crap. Yeah you get someting cool every now and then but still dont care for it. Nerd Block comment starsgtThe concept of Nerblock is a great one. I really liked that I had the option to pick what kind of box I could subscribe to. However I have several issues with Nerdblock on its own.gtIt never felt like there was a theme to each box besides the initial arcade vs. horror vs. whatever box. Everything inside felt random and tended to be from rather obscure fandoms.They never announce what kinds of items one is going to get in the different boxes for each month so youre left guessing as to which one will suit your interests best.They advertise items for their boxes that they dont actually have nor have ever had in any of their boxes.My box always showed up the month after it was meant for. November block would show up in December etc.Literally every shirt I have gotten from them ripped somewhere within the first week of having them.The box felt overly expensive compared to the quality of items.Its not a terrible box to get I know some people love it and it is really neat that they have several different box options. However I found myself more often than not feeling disappointed after every box when I should have been excited.Personally Ive had good experiences with both boxes although I feel that the quality of the items varies significantly from month to month. My recommendation is to make sure you appreciate the theme for the month you plan to purchase. You mentioned liking Deadpool and both boxes will have Deadpool items this month so you can look at the other fandoms too.The February  Loot Crate theme DEAD is guaranteed to have stuff from    Deadpool   The Walking Dead    The February  Nerd Block theme Deadpool at Home is guaranteed to have stuff from   Deadpool   Batman   Mario  If youd like to support the mission of MonthlyBoxHub Id love if you posted a rating andor unboxing of whichever box you end up getting once you receive the contents. ,SubscriptionBoxes,czp4c4d,1,t5_2vlml
6759257,0,t1_d0i5dqq,Yes I do. First off I use google sheets which is easily accessible on everything already. I also dont really use a template Im just using my own function based inventory system that involves creating an inventory of my intagible and tangible itemsservicesfunctionsproblemsaccessoriesreceiptsinstructionsetc...and categorizing them all accordingly. Within that costs is one aspect in a directory ive created and it lists off the value of what i paid for something so i know next time i might have to buy it if it breaks or whatever monthly cost electricity consumed which can then be put into an actual total monthly cost since that matters too but people dont really realize etc..etc..I can show you and Im willing to help you guys out if youd like it since I think its a good idea but as it is right now Ill honestly say its not much more than just a spreadsheet. Even if its free most people consider having to make a free account too steep of a payment for something that simple. I personally think if you want to make something unique implementing a streamlined and cleaner version of what Im doing would be a good way to do it.

11475964,0,t1_dfw8c5m,Thank you so much! We appreciate your thoughtful response. Its all too common individuals see a price tag and correlate it with the price they might expect from a chain company that sources from warehouses elsewhere that care more about quantity over quality therefore giving a much cheaper price. ,SubscriptionBoxes,dfwso9q,2,t5_2vlml
