8295318,0,t1_d5eg26l,I do understand what you are saying.  It bothers you that people who get in on the ground floor or invest money at anytime get more power and more money than people who dont invest money.  You are kind of a communist who should stay on Reddit and not get involved.You speak from lack of knowledge  No new users will even be able to reach close to the position of the people who acquired steempower in the first month.Well I sure would have liked to have bought Apple stock in the late s at  a share.  Those evil people who got in early have more power and money than me.  Boofuckinghoo.  Poor me!The system allows you to purchase as much Steem Power as you like at the market price of Steem.  Now that price is high.  Earlier it was low.  Later as inflation and the dilution that follows kicks in it will certainly be cheaper again.  And then higher because some new thing is announced or introduced.If you believe that because people who get in early get more than people who come in later never get involved in the stock market or venture capital.  Because thats exactly what happens in those two arenas.  Early money gets big equity.  Late equity pays much much more.You are either completely ignorant of economics and market mechanisms and you havent even read the first two pages of the White Paper all this is explained in the first two pages or you are just a big crybaby who thinks everything should be fair.Life is not fair.  Markets are not fair.  The early bird catches the worm.  Those who come later get a lot less worms to choose from.Read the White Paper.  I am not responsible for spoon feeding you Economics and Finance .  Steem is common stock.  Steem Power is convertible debt.  Steam Dollars are liquid cash that can go back out to the market to by back Steem or exit in BTC.Quit crying.  Maybe I am clever.  Maybe I just did the homework and you havent.  You want Steem Power?  Buy all you like!  You can have more than anyone else!  You CAN reach the levels of the people who acquired Steem Power in the first month  you just have to pay more because the price has gone up due to THE MARKET.,steemit,d5eh1xb,-3,t5_3cqqp

8347650,0,t1_d5l00v5,Yeah.  Is a scammer.  Thats why I offered  cents and thats the best offer he got.  Dont forget agentorange on steemit is a scammer.  We even have his picture!,steemit,d5l0cfa,0,t5_3cqqp
8428144,0,t3_4v33g0,I think it is because the scheme is slowly collapsing. Founders and early adopters have so much steem power that they can simply upvote their own posts and comments to earn free steem power and steem dollars. But where does the value come from? At some point new money inflow dries up and steem dollars wont be able to hold the peg to  although they are backed by steem.,steemit,d5v253k,3,t5_3cqqp
