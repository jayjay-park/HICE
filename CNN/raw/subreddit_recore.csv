8962019,0,t3_5316e1,Id say return it and dont bother buying any edition until they fix the end game and make it actually possible to finish the game  no one should be paying full price for it. and even if they do fix the missing content thats not gonna change the awful ending to the game.,recore,d7p3lua,3,t5_38oxm

The charge shot will be released and will connect right after you enter the minigame killing the enemy and giving you the core.,recore,d7pg01g,1,t5_38oxm

9008560,0,t3_53fon5,Thank you for doing this! Its a shame that this is probably the most interesting story in the game and its hidden by gibberish talk. ,recore,d7uorv6,1,t5_38oxm

9020644,0,t3_53nzes,So in the end the option still not available I went and confronted the bolt cutter boss again. Weirdly enough Joule didnt speak this time in the cutscene.This time defeated him! Such relief for him to then respawn and remain in the same spot so I killed it again.... and got another prism core. Then it respawned AGAIN! So I went right up close it moved and killed me. Then when it reloaded it went to the cutscene on the train. Then my button for return to crawler worked again. Painful.,recore,d7w51yz,1,t5_38oxm

11627200,0,t1_dgdv5r5,Ah I completely understand where you are coming from. I bought BF Hardline at launch and the next two map packs only for no servers to be populated. Ive decided Im not buying games at launch anymore as it seems developers are taking full advantage of DLCs and expansions. Punishing early adopters of their games.,recore,dgdyemn,2,t5_38oxm
