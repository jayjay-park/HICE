5291133,0,t3_3ngw4d,they picked sivir all three times. yes rekkles didnt played bad on her his damage output espeacially in the losing games was still high but i think the sivir pick can be a sign that he is stuck in the summer split dont know what patch that was and that he has troubles adjusting to the new patch.,fnatic,cvo05oz,2,t5_2ud2p

6143596,0,t1_cy6ynep,Speaking about western tops soaz is the best after huni. Dont knoelw why people criticize him so much. In IEM he tored apart hauntzer and darshan.

9487398,0,t1_d9i7pob,Thing is prizemoneys are maybe of less importance than streaming for example.Sponsor money has a much bigger weight than prizemoney ta least on Lol and since streaming is very sparse and has lower number of viewers in EU than NA for example.With venture capital entering the scene I think Fnatic should be worried and try to find ways to get funding. Huni and RO are  examples of players that left due to the higher salaries courtesy of venture capital in IMT.,fnatic,d9iiwjg,1,t5_2ud2p
9571946,0,t3_5bwlw1,I dont think so. It would be nice for fans to have the gooodoldays Fnatic member back but I dont think its possible because Quaye and Rekkles said they they were already hosting tryouts with for a  man roster.With SoaZ coming in this late I dont think theyll contact him.,fnatic,d9sxrgx,1,t5_2ud2p

9833341,0,t3_5g32so,gtThe  LCS lineup pending approval from Riot Games is as follows ...From Fnatic Website...Its pretty simple I cheer for players not for the brand. I wont ever cheer for Caps unless his mindset changes completely. Honestly it would be a  degree turn unlikely to happen.Sad to say but my days cheering for Fnatic might be over soon. Its saddening me even more considering I really like the rest of the man roster...,fnatic,dapb1gg,1,t5_2ud2p
10662235,0,t3_5sk1qj,You did say it was a bad idea.I at the time said I would like to watch the team play for a couple of weeks before making an acessement.Well  weeks have past and tbh Im dissapointed but not that much.Caps was a pleasant surprise in how comfortable he feels on stage and how quickly he is improving. I think we have a diamond in the rough here and potentially Caps can become another great EU mid.As for sOAZ he met my expectations.Amazing I was never very confident about to begin with. He has performed poorly imo but I think if Broxah gels well with the main team we have a great jungler.Jesiz also dissapointed me. Not because he gets caught off here and there but because I thought the team strategy and macro would be better seeing he was an analyst for a year and all.Overall I think the team can and will improve tremendously.Lets see how Broxah works with the team. Fingers crossed it goes well.,fnatic,ddfq8a2,6,t5_2ud2p
10757569,0,t1_ddpjhsl,Also TSM has a bigger fanbase in LoL and is from NA like C. So its not particularly likely that well get to see FNC at Katowice.,fnatic,ddpka24,1,t5_2ud2p
10801638,0,t3_5ughmn,The Only players i see worth playing for fnatic is REKKLES CAPS BROXAH. We just lost a series to a game that is considered to be in alot of trouble because of their mistakes and communication issues.

11112788,0,t3_5ynwfn,On a serious note though fnatic drafted a lategame teamfight comp with a lot of waveclear and played it like you should play a lategame teamfight comp. I did not think fnatic had it in them to draft well and play to their win condition. Lets go game  baby,fnatic,dermimf,2,t5_2ud2p

11227496,0,t1_df4kavv,Well just check the stats in lcs and you have to think about the diffrence between the teams Rekkles plays in a struggling fnatic and still manages to get these stats where like zven plays in a dominant g that easily wins over every team.,fnatic,df4meh6,1,t5_2ud2p
11245536,0,t3_60h02n,Our problems have been way bigger than just drafts. If bad drafts were the only problem I think this is a weird time to make a change like this. The problems are probably many and big enough that we had to just amputate the dying limb immediately and then do what we can with what weve got. Quaye writes that he will try to give the players a better structure. So there have likely been issues in the day to day tasks between LCS games as well as drafts being poor. ,fnatic,df6nxug,1,t5_2ud2p
11267769,0,t1_df7m23k,we have no idea what kind of coach yellowstar would be and we cannot know for sure he would be great. Grat support and ability to shotcall doesnt instantly make you a coach. Maybe a good analysts but a coach requires you being both a teacher and a boss. Sometimes teachers knows a lot about their stuff but sill are shitty teacher cause they dont know how handle their class and actually teach them. Sometimes boss have the best ideas but are too kind and flexible with their staff and the company run poorly.Truth is there is no super great coach atm and the one that successfully made a name for themselves are taken already. I believe its not a coach we should hire its a stable and consistent team that have an established work pattern that goes behind we will jsut scrim and see how it goes from there. ,fnatic,df96o1z,0,t5_2ud2p

11622358,0,t1_dgdcbp1,I think that the thing we really need is a coach. Yes Quaye is doing a good job but that is because the players know to a degree what they need to do to win. If we get an actual coach we might have a pretty good chance to win. The late season surge is mostly due to players having good enough mechanics to defeat the other team and weve seen that fall flat vs G who are good enought to go toe to toe with us mechanicly and are better than us on the macro level. We could also use getting kikis on the main roster and swaping kikis and soaz depending on what we want to do.,fnatic,dgdelna,1,t5_2ud2p
