4262591,0,t1_cs4pi08,About Kawashima I felt like I understood why he was dropped from the starting squad in Belgium watching his Punching or timing of jumps.gt I arrive in Japan on Tuesday afternoon so I gotta make a mad dash directly to the game.Wow   Hope youll there in time and enjoy the game. The tickets are sold out all of a sudden right after the Iraq game. Should be in great atmosphere.As for the qualifier round framework I agree. We will have to have two games each against Cambodia and Afghanistan. It occupies our international match days while Asian teams have to have more opportunities to try stronger teams to be competitive in the World Cup.Maybe AFC wanted big teams to circulate more Asian countries? If so I kind of understand that significance in many ways but there are two to three such teams at each group with that level. Thats kind of too much.  Or maybe its just national FAs who wanted to have big home games have lots more votes in AFC ,JLeague,cs641zk,1,t5_2u4f4
4669392,0,t1_ctig4gn,Thanks for the reply! Ill have to make a deepdive later but it looks like if AntlersReysol is on the Friday it would be impossible due to general distance plus that morning Im arriving back to Tokyo after a couple days in Kanazawa. Would be a bit rushed for time BB it would just be a slog of a day.FC Tokyo would make sense but yeah might go to Yokohama as more of a general dayout in that city never been period. Very curious about the Omiya vs Vortis on the Sunday though! How long would transport  be approx via train from Shinjuku JR?Nagoya will probably still be in the cards strictly as something to do. At the same time have not been since  and if it looks like I have enough general sights galleries etc to see over two days I could skip it.In terms of what Ive seen previously the only J League game I have seen was a Kyoto Sanga game last year. Id be happy to squeeze in a couple if I could this trip. Had a wellenough time last year but it was pretty dead. And...I got a pretty rocking sunburn. Ha ha. My fault.,JLeague,ctj4og9,1,t5_2u4f4

7276937,0,t1_d25bjhf,All of those games except one take place on the island of Kyushu which is where the quake occurred.  The transportation network has been damaged in the quake.  Its not ideal to have fans clogging the already disrupted network.  The match not on Kyushu features Kumamoto which is the worst affected area.  It would be in poor taste to play a game while their fans are trying to stay alive.,JLeague,d25c7us,1,t5_2u4f4
7696102,0,t1_d3gur11,And arent Omiya like fourth? Sounds like a great game.I attended Hiroshima Sanfrecce vs. Gamba Osaka this weekend. Not a great game but a ton of fun. ENJOY!,JLeague,d3gzw9q,1,t5_2u4f4
7696245,0,t3_4klju7,Okay uMeganezuki laid down the list of matches but missed a couple key points June  is the final round of the First Stage. The winners will qualify for the groan J.League Championship playoff. There will be a trophy ceremony of some sort that nobody cares about because the twostage system is horseshit. But it will happen and it will likely happen at one of these matches. As such TICKETS MAY SELL OUT. ESPECIALLY FOR FRONTALE. IF YOU DECIDE THE GAME YOU WANT TO SEE ARRANGE TICKETS ASAP. All kickoffs will be at PM which means that you can expect to get back pretty late especially if youre at certain stadiums.With that said here are the matches and why you shouldshouldnt goUrawa Reds vs. Vissel Kobe Saitama Stadium  Urawa Reds are currently two points out of first place with two games in hand  there is a very good chance they will finish the stage on top unless they manage to fuck it up. Saitama Stadium is basically the best big stadium in the J.League and will be packed with Reds supporters giving it a fantastic atmosphere. Absolute recommend.Kawasaki Frontale vs. Omiya Ardija Todoroki Stadium. Sure its a tracked stadium and sure the outside of the new main stand opened last year looks like your dads woodpaneled Buick. But Frontale home games have a great atmosphere in and outside the stadium from the food stands of Fronpark to the Doraemon statues placed around the ground and all the crazy special pregamehalftime events they do everything from sumo wrestlers taking PKs to F racers doing laps around the track. Frontale are currently in st place and this would be their firstever J trophy if they manage to hold on. And never mind that Omiya Ardija are the surprise package of this season in th place following promotion from the J. Very very strong recommend if Urawa werent playing at home Id send you here.Yokohama F. Marinos vs. FC Tokyo Nissan Stadium. I might recommend this match if there was nothing else happening but both teams are playing poorly and Nissan Stadium is one of the worst venues in the J.League. Horrible sight lines expensive tickets rds of the stadium is usually covered up in tarps because its just way too big to support a J.League club.Kashiwa Reysol vs. Shonan Bellmare Kashiwa Stadium. My favorite little ground about an hour from Tokyo. Really fantastic atmosphere and Reysol are actually doing well this season but it just doesnt compare to the Reds or Frontale home games. That said if Reds andor Frontale sell out give this one a shot. You wont be disappointed.Kashima Antlers vs. Avispa Fukuoka. There is a good chance Antlers may steal the first stage title! Unfortunately their stadium is in the assend of nowhere Ibaraki Prefecture. Youd need to take a special bus from Tokyo Station and navigate the return bus right after the match. If you dont live in Japan and arent familiar with where all the bus stops are and how to get tickets I cant honestly recommend it.,JLeague,d3h0ha2,3,t5_2u4f4
9696832,0,t3_5df193,Feeling more confident about Cerezo going into the playoffs compared to a couple of weeks ago but still not sure how theyll do. Think its possible to get past Kyoto Sanga but then Matsumoto Yamaga are a big challenge. Even if Cerezo did do marginally better against Matsumoto this season. ,JLeague,da8c9q5,1,t5_2u4f4

11739179,0,t3_67in97,The th Gameweek of the JLeague happened this weekend. This weeks fixture feature a number of excellent goals and some surprising results. The table is still extremely competitive with only  points separating th place from th. The first game this week sees Jubilo Iwata travel to Kashima to take on champions Kashima Antlers. After Sagan Tosus Yohei Toyoda netted the first goal of the game in the th minute last week no one would blame Jubilo fans who decided to leave early. However before they could even get up off their seats Adailton scored an almost immediate equaliser. If that wasnt good enough Uzbek Fozil Musaev scored the winner  minutes into injury time. Their opponents today Kashima Antlers also had a successful last game bouncing back from their loss against Cerezo Osaka with a comprehensive  win against Vegalta Sendai. This result propelled them up the table into second place. While Jubilo sit lower in th any result can easily move a team up or down a table. The next game sees Sanfrecce Hiroshima take on Vegalta Sendai in a game both teams will be looking forward to winning. Even though Vegalta didnt have the worse start to the season they have been on the receiving end of two large defeats which saw them concede  goals over both games. After a moral boosting win the week before last Sanfrecce then disappointingly lost  to Yokohama F.Marinos. This result combined with a win for Albirex Niigata saw them sink to second bottom  points into the relegation zone. A win for both teams would be extremely useful. Vegalta Sendai need the points to stop the rot of the last two losses and Sanfrecce Hiroshima need the points to avoid becoming cut adrift at the bottom of the table. The third game of these highlights pits Gamba Osaka against Omiya Ardija. Following last weeks draw with Cerezo Osaka Gamba were overtaken into fourth place by Yokohama F.Marinos. Their opponents Omiya Ardija managed there first point of the season against Shimizu SPulse and were only denied a win by an th minute goal. No one really gives Ardija a chance in this game however people will retort that in a similar game the week before last when a winless team came to Osaka Sanfrecce Hiroshima walked away with a  win. Vissel Kobes spell at the top of the table was finally brought to an end last week due to a  loss against Kashiwa Reysol. In their place arose Urawa Red Diamonds who had dispatched FC Tokyo in a clinical  win. The team from Saitama returned to the position they had inhabited at the end of last season. Under this seasons rules Urawa would have been last seasons champions. Instead they felt the bitter taste of silver as Kashima Antlers triumphed in the Jleague grandfinal. This season with the two stage format abandoned Urawa Reds know that if they keep this position till the end of the season they will be champions. Their first opponents as table toppers are the team from Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. Consadole kept up their decent home form last time out with a  draw against Kawasaki Frontale. However this game is being held  miles away at the Saitama Stadium. Consadole still remain pointless away from home will this be the time for their first away points of the season?The other games this week not mentioned so far are Kawasaki Frontale v Shimizu SPulse Albirex Niigata v FC Tokyo Kashiwa Reysol v Yokohama F.Marinos Ventforet Kofu v Cerezo Osaka and Sagan Tosu v Vissel Kobe Keep an eye out for the round mascot at the beginning of this game.
