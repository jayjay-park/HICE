6266802,0,t1_cz1xw2n,Does the system support units with non equipped weapons or are they automatically equipped at all points?  Instead of stealing maybe Thieves could either have a skill proc to disarm or just a disarm skill that way they become a super useful support unit for units with weapon triangle disadvantage Heck it instantly makes pairing them up with Paladins and horse slayers a non issue since Thieves can actually keep up with the Paladins better than most units.,FEMP,cz1ys07,1,t5_39vbg

6366106,0,t3_42udia,Youll have to take care to still give people a reason to use Ross and Dart then. Their stats might need an extra nudge to compete with Franz with axes.,FEMP,czd98c7,1,t5_39vbg
6527214,0,t1_czugah8,Lol yeah i think his  stats are balanced out by his  mov. Makes sense. I expect the meta for fememes will even overtake the main tournament mode we use some day.,FEMP,czugsdc,1,t5_39vbg
6581710,0,t3_45siqz,I almost definitely can participate saturday. I think.Gonna check with serenes right now if we do have a tourney saturday Ill make Luna a priority,FEMP,d003pd5,1,t5_39vbg

7525639,0,t1_d2xgrlz,Since i have now realised how many smsasassins cannot double ewan and pegs get one shot i think for my team the only way to kill them is matthew but has mediocre skill or ephraim. I believe eph is the one counter on my team to excalliburs since he can stay out of range and hit them with seigmund. Now thats rather situational but eph can take a hit and one shot ewan and probably all but canas who isnt very fast.Thats why i like the idea of lowering the speed boost to  or reducing the power of it. Personally i think Ewan is the best excallibur user with high magic speed for a mage and luck with decent skill and resistance. With a speed power drop this makes ewan not hit so hard or any others especially when most units are defensive. This isnt nerfing Ewan though i could afford to lose  magic so without excallibur he can be useful but makes his use of excallibur less useful. This goes for other mages as well.But what we really need is a strength using high resistance unit that doesnt get doubled nor doubles them. Im thinking like  resistance so they could take two hits possibly and do decent damage back.,FEMP,d2xmm2f,1,t5_39vbg
7631565,0,t1_d39c0ij,Im torn between centering it and having it in the corner. I see the merit in both ideas but yeah the text bleeding has to go but like I said in my other reply its really low priority in comparison to the other bugs on our plate.,FEMP,d39o1i4,1,t5_39vbg
7768015,0,t1_d3p5g6p,I bolded the issue you mentioned.  I know that bug fixing is the  issue but if we get so caught up doing that and only that people will lose interest in the game.  Some people already are actually.  This subReddit needs to be alive it needs to be active.  Thats the only way well be able to grab peoples attention and potentially get more users who are willing to help and to keep the help that we have.,FEMP,d3p5ths,1,t5_39vbg
7810134,0,t3_4macka,The only problem with doing WEXP is that the very shaky balance we have would be thrown wayward because you could just beef certain units and it would nerf any team. I do agree that Legendary weapons shouldnt be accessible as they are currently. Well have to keep that in mind going forward. I think I agree with uthrowawaytactician when I say that they shouldnt get speed buffs. Is there anything else you think might need fixing? I do agree that taking imbalanced things out for now and bringing them back once balanced has restored is a good plan.,FEMP,d3tx8w8,1,t5_39vbg
7914516,0,t3_4nm930,Ive found a few things some big some less so that Im going to report tomorrow morning If I dont get them fixed myself Im not at home right now.  Maybe its just my computer but try minimizing your client D Dont do this in a gameI probably wont have time to fix that one it seems like a graphics engine bug which I dont have time to deal with given that I can really only work on this on the weekends.,FEMP,d45o0gn,1,t5_39vbg
