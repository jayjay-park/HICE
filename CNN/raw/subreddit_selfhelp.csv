7714,0,t1_cefavqs,Im sorry to hear that.Having someone that you care about that youre open and vulnerable with treat you in that way and abuse your trust is a painful and traumatic experience.What I would strongly point out and I dont know the specifics if your past relationship is that her actions cheating and hurting you were not your fault.Honestly thats what you need to deal with if you want to feel comfortable and trust others.Your exs choices were her own. Shes her own person and she did what she did all by herself. No matter what she says about you or the other guy. Her actions were her own.Now obviously you have some emotional pain associated with that betrayal. And you know what? Thats good. It tells me that you give a shit about other people. Because you cant get hurt like that unless you invest yourself emotionally in others. So I can tell that youre a good person.What I strongly suggest is that you accept that this feeling. Being anxious. Is ok. Its there to stay for now but it will slowly fade away.So what can you do? Dont fight it. Dont avoid it. Explore it.If you feel those physical responses take it as an opportunity to relax and really experience what it feels like. How does your throat feel? How does your chest feel? Because anxiety is just an emotion. Its just a feeling. It cant do anything else but sit there and make you uncomfortable.If you accept that its not going anywhere and you observe it like a scientist you can learn that its not really that bad. Its just a feeling and thats ok. Once you allow it to be it loses its power over you.Its like having a radio playing in the background. Youll get used to it youll even forget about it at times. But dont try and not listen to it because that just isnt possible. Just say oh Im feeling anxious because of x and thats ok.TLDR Someone cannot blame their actions on you. Accept your emotions they will come and go. They are neither good or bad. Some are pleasant and some are uncomfortable but learn to accept them and they will hold no power over you.,selfhelp,cefbc4h,5,t5_2qho7
16286,0,t1_ceg9zq2,You wouldnt happen to be the older sibling would you? Pet theory of mine is that younger siblings tend to get more attention and therefore are more often reinforced for a variety of activities causing them to engage in them more and developing them into talents. Either way I can understand why it would be more fun to have talents that could readily garner praise and admiration from others especially if you are comparing yourself to those around you who get incredible amounts of attention for those sorts or things and you find yourself lacking in a similar intensity of attention from others. Im like you in some ways that I have a talent for observing people and getting them to tell me things. I like to think that Ive developed that into a skill that I now use in my job though not something I can show off on a regular basis. Im also a good singer and guitar player so like your sister I can pull these out and others will be impressed. I dont do this all the time but its nice to know I can if I want to. I also dont consider this to be an inborn talent as Ive had to take lessons for each.From what youve said it seems like you have a lot going for you. Youre educated directed toward a healthy lifestyle and even have natural talents that you are aware of. In some sense youre way ahead of the game. Id even hasten to bet that you are ahead of your sister in some ways that youve failed to recognize. You are unique and just because others dont acknowledge that on a regular basis is no reason for concern. Whats important is that you dont doubt how special you are. If you dont see it it will be that much harder for others to. You dont need to look for traditional markers of success or value to determine your worth the only value you need is the confidence you have in what you are capable of. Tldr Although it may seem like youre jealousy stems from a lack of talent its really a lack of praise. You lack praise because your talents are not those which typically garner praise. Disregard the need to impress others and impress yourself. ,selfhelp,cegadpw,1,t5_2qho7

70556,0,t3_1uw14j,In a way the unknown can be fun! I wrote an article about it here  . But yeah that doesnt really deal with the DOWNSIDES of not knowing and how it CAN be scary like you say. However! Maybe the technique that I use for worry can help you here. If you start thinking what if this happens? What if that happens?? then just ask yourself definitely Ok what IF it happens???? What would I ACTUALLY do? Then go ahead and think through the situation that youre worried about and instead of just worrying about it imagine yourself in that situation. Play it out in your mind! Go through what you could do how you might feel and how you could productively respond to it. After all we cant control the situations we get into really. But we CAN control our responses. So by thinking through your responses you might be able to feel prepared for those situations youre worried about.For things that youre worried about because you dont know or have a good idea of how theyll play out just try thinking through the worst case scenario. So for a question like Whats going to happen to this?  imagine the worst possible scenario and imagine yourself IN IT imagine that its already happened. Think through what you would do. Once you feel prepared for the worst maybe you can focus more of your energy on the actual known situation that youre facing since you can rest in the knowledge that you feel prepared for the worst. So yeah if your glucose goes haywire if you get the worst possible complications if the worst thing happens that you can imagine what would you do? Really. Not like oh no what would you do???? in a despairing sort of way but just answering the very practical question of given a perhaps unwanted situation what would you do?.The above technique is actually one I bring up in my article on anxiety since it seems to help with that as well as worry although to some extent the two are similar or perhaps the same. So in case you feel like reading up on anxiety and how it seems to work at least according to what Ive found working through my own anxiety then you can check out that article here  .I guess thats about it for now! I hope it helps and if it doesnt I would definitely like to hear about it so maybe I could help you further based off of what didnt work. That all being said take care  ah actually glancing at your post theres one more article that might be of help to you one similar to the anxiety one but this one is on stress  . If you really want to look for a way to deal productively with stress to learn from it and to bring more peace into your life then that article might help you. The basic idea behind working through stress has to do with having inner conversations with your peaceful side in order to come to terms with and understand situations in your life and what you can do about them situations that normally cause stress. Its a totally personal kind of experience and allows you to sort of take ownership of your own stress and the growth and learning that can come from working through it. Um ok THAT all being said I suppose thats it for now  so take care and good luck with handling both the future and your present stress over that future  ,selfhelp,cemgms4,2,t5_2qho7

274643,0,t1_cf8y5de,I just wanted to add something  since after posting my original comments I looked at your profile and other posts and so I saw the post relating to one of the central reasons of why youre down. I just wanted to add the following in response to reading thatWhat happened gives you every right to be negative and to think life sucks. Its very tempting to believe yourself  to deny any possibility that life also doesnt suck that there is good in it and good in all the bad you see. But only seeing the bad doesnt move your life anywhere  just see the bad and I feel like you will just feel stuck and will stay depressed and not do much at all. Im sorry that your boyfriend abandoned you but maybe you can be the person to support and cheer yourself up with or without him. I feel like as hard or as unreasonable as it might seem deliberately looking for the good in the world and in all of your experiences and in all the things in life you feel are bad  that seeing the good in these things will set you free. Free to live your life to feel love and enthusiasm and joy. For everything there may be a negative way of looking at things that may seem very obvious but there can also be a positive way. Even if the only positive you can find in something is that its not as bad as something else thats still at least one positive. If you want to bring yourself energy life enthusiasm joy  its crucial I feel like to look for the good in everything. Even in something that seems so terrible that there could be no good in it at all. At least youre alive. At least you can forge your own future. At least you have operation of your limbs at least you have access to the internet at least at least at least. Look for the good in the bad  if you look for it you may find it. Thats what overcoming negativity is about  its not about a fake positive attitude  its about looking the most terrible things in life in the face the things that you just cant find a way to feel positive about at all and to look for it  despite your mind maybe telling you that there is nothing good. That is just your mind just your perception. Look anyway. Thats what I encourage you to do. No matter the tragedy no matter the setbacks no matter how much bitterness you feel towards any number of things in life  look for the good.I dont know if this or any of what I suggested previously was helpful but I just wanted to share this with you because I feel like it might really help you that this kind of approach might actually have a chance of helping you to meet the challenges youre facing. Maybe Im wrong. Maybe Im totally not understanding the situation or your feelings or what you really need. But I can only do the best with what I can and know or think I know. In any case thats all I really wanted to share for now. Take care.,selfhelp,cf989dw,2,t5_2qho7

I also met some through activities I do. I joined a Krav Maga school its an Israeli martial art where I have met more than a few acquaintances and some of them are turning into friends. I also love meetup.com for interacting with people and meeting new friends. Ive also met a few people through my work.When it comes to relationships be they platonic or romantic I really think its a numbers game. You wont mesh with the vast majority of people out there so you have to cast a wide net and meet with many different people before you find those that are worth hanging out with again and again. I mentioned that Ive been in this city about a year and I have about  good friends now. During that year I probably met over  different people maybe even close to . Some of it was for business but others were just during parties social engagements or dates. That means that if I meet someone brand new there is about a  chance they will end up being a good friend.The key is to do activities go to meetups just invite people out for coffee to see if you click.

And as a recruiter who talks to people every day I can assure you that it is very possible to switch career paths. However you will lose any experience  seniority you may have built up.Think of Michael Jordan. One of the best and highest paid basketball players ever. He decided to try baseball... where he was not the best and by no means the highest paid. Just because you are good at one thing doesnt mean you will be good at the next thing.If you decide to switch your line of work to something that will make you happier it will take a few years to establish yourself but in the long run you will be much better off.

2788301,0,t3_2rzw82,I might be parroting some of what has been said here already but I think a point like this cannot be repeated enough. Loving yourself comes first. It sounds like you are frustrated with your own behaviour personality or identity. I think you will be much more comfortable in your own skin once you fix what you dont like about yourself. Loving yourself is a very worthy goal and although you may want to get back with your fiance and I hope that you do there is nothing more important than finding validation and compassion independently. Often our internal achievements become expressed externally as well which I think is part of the reasons why confident and selfassured people are so charismatic because they love themselves we feel inclined to love them too. This may all sound strange but having come out of a devastating breakup and taking this advice myself I can honestly say that its the best decision Ive ever made. Make your end goal a happy independent life. Maybe you will get back together  maybe not. But either way if you accomplish selflove youll be happy either way!

4968594,0,t1_cukqxnv,Look into anxiety. Im not saying that is what it is but if it resonates with you it may be worth noting. As far as handling stress and problems there are many techniques to help with that. One of the big things is to take care of yourself. This means getting a full nights sleep eating healthy exercising limiting alcohol and even caffeine and making sure you have someone to talk to. This may seem like pretty silly advice but as someone who has anxiety my day is incredibly improved and more things seem possible when I make sure to take care of myself. When you start off in a good place the days challenges seem easier but when you start off already fighting fatigue bloat etc the challenges seem insurmountable. If you are already doing those things take it a step further. What things stress you out? What problems do you think you cant handle? Break them down to what you are really scared of. It may not be that you are afraid of your boss but that you are scared of losing your job. It may not be that you cant decide what to do to fix the problem but that you are overwhelmed by the decision and all of the options.

See problems as situations you need to change and tackle them like you would a math problem. This could start as simple as doing all your chores effectively and on time. Let yourself get good at doing them. Youll see as you get used to accomplishing things youll have more energy to think about other goals while continuing to accomplish the old ones. One day a situation will arise where you wont even think about it youll just do it.

I sometimes have a hard time making friends  and I really think that a lot of it is because I assume people wont like me before I meet them and then unintentionally act distantaloof when I do meet them. And then poof they end up not liking me. Or I assume people hate me after I meet them for  minutes like you did with everyone laughing at you and then never follow uptry to be friends with them. ANd then poof we never become friends. It just isnt rational to assume that you know what anyone is thinking  the fact is we have NO idea. And we have to accept that. You could have done great in their eyes or could have bombed so bad that they laughed you out of the office. But how did you feel you did? Good? Then you did good! Move on. Next job.

They would be most knowledgeable about the subject and ways to help you. Take this with a grain of salt as I am no professional. It sounds like these emotions are fearbased. The fear causes you to obsess over the differences and similarities between you and this other person. In turn the obsessions cause the behavior i.e. checking instagram every time you pick up your phone. You could try meditation to figure out the source of your fear and why it scares you so much. It might also show you how to overcome it mentally. I wish you the best of luck.,selfhelp,cya325q,4,t5_2qho7

6208770,0,t3_40lhuw,I can understand how you feel when I was little  or so a boy Id liked told me my eyes were poop colored. I have hazel eyes so i dont see how they looked like poop but I digress. I was devastated for a long time I disliked my eyes. My great grandmother found out and told me to never be ashamed of my looks. She told me that my eyes looked like my great grandfathers eyes golden clear and sincere eyes. I never met him he died when my grandmother was young but he was someone who was highly thought of and a wonderful person. My great grandmother told me she was glad a piece of him had survived in me. Ive loved my eyes ever since. Im sure your eyes are lovely too brown eyes are nothing to be ashamed of. They come in so many shades and varieties. If youre looking into acting may I suggest using your eyes. Try and use them as an asset. Make them expressive and use them to your advantage. I can guarantee if you can use your eyes to your advantage then no casting director will care about the color. Just remember your eyes are beatiful just like you. Best of luck with acting too! ,selfhelp,cyvdc7t,1,t5_2qho7

7051505,0,t3_4c68j6,One thing to look at is your foot position while walking. Ideally other than if you have a medical condition you want your feet to be pointing straight ahead rather than angled in pigeon toed or angled out duckfooted because walking in either of those ways can lead to all kinds of foot ankle knee hip and back issues.This is just anecdotal but I have noticed that a lot of people who scuff the outside of their heels are walking duckfooted.One thing you can try is experimenting with midfoot or forefoot walking rather than heel striking.  It can help you to become more aware of what your feet are doing when you walk because you may have your feet angled up unnecessarily high.  Pro tip forefoot walking is also how some people walk across grates on the floor or soft dirt in high heels without the heel getting stuck or sinking in.It is also worth looking at what the rest of your body is doing while you walk.  Ideally you want to get as close to pure forwards motion as you can so that if someone can only see your head over a fence it looks like youre basically rolling forwards on a bike.  Lots of people bob up and down or sway side to side or twist back and forth.Its sort of related to Invisible Lat Syndrome but lots of guys never want to relax their abs so their entire body sways around when they walk because they are not letting their hips articulate naturally.There are some great stretching routines out there to help with flexibility because you may not realize that you have unnaturally tight hips or glutes which is causing you to scuff your heels.,selfhelp,d1fna7j,3,t5_2qho7

7357830,0,t3_4ffp9f,gt Its like I am constantly thinking about everything but when I try to focus on what I am thinking about it just vanishes. Its like a river gt flowing with nothing in it. Idk whats going. It seems from your post that this has happened recently.  What was happening in your life at the time it began?  Was there some significant life change or emotional trauma?  Did someone die?  Did you lose your job?  Did you get divorced?  etc.Its possible there is a physical change in your brain but that seems unlikely if it happened suddenly.  I suppose it could be a stroke especially a ministroke where there are few symptoms.  Would be good to look into that.  But our brain is a complex system.  Research is showing that our thoughts affect our brains function which affects our thoughts which affects our brain function etc.  So it is possible for changes in our environment to change our brain which means we also have the ability to change it back through targeted intervention.If it is software driven rather than hardware driven then those thoughts that are flowing through your mind have something driving them.  They dont arise just because.  There is an emotional driver and if you clear that emotional driver your thoughts will stop this behavior.  Here is a list of selfhelp techniques  .  Study the material pick one or more of those techniques and then apply it to the flowing thoughts.  That will lead you eventually to the underlying emotional issue.  Once you clear it the thoughts will stop.If you listen to brainwave entrainment in the delta range the brainwave of deep sleep it will help you to go to sleep.  And help resolve your flowing thoughts so that is another avenue to pursue.Take care.,selfhelp,d2ej9q3,1,t5_2qho7

If you have insurance your employer might have a counseling service available.  You need a professional to work with you on these.  Not because theres anything wrong with you but because youve been traumatized by going through so much and you need help processing and dealing with it.  I only know a little bit of the troubles youve been through  my stepdad was physically abusive to me as a teen and I told teachers but nothing happened.  My mom witnessed it but it only sparked fights between them and nothing changing.  Im still on okay terms with them now that Im in my s but there are times it still comes up in arguments or family drama.  Thankfully my kids have never been a part of such abuse  it is possible to break the cycle my friend.  Youve made the right steps in giving yourself space from your family.

8698888,0,t3_4z25v1,Theres nothing wrong with you that time and focus cant change. You have an active mind  its always working  and because of that you are becoming aware of the world around you and the limitless amount of things you can think about. the OCD comes from overthinking  it becomes a trap where eventually you end up thinking about how to stop thinking...and that never works. Trust issues stem from a rising awareness that life is uncertain which is true  but it doesnt have to be a bad thing. Your parents getting a divorce would have served as a memorable lesson that life is uncertain but I wouldnt tie your trust issues to that event alone. Lastly I would say that your mood swings and the feeling of going up and down on an emotional rollercoaster comes from your selfimage. When you view yourself positively and believe others do as well youre up  when you dont feel that positive image is validated it starts to fade and eventually you have trouble seeing any good in you at all. The good news is that these problems are totally normal and often serve as a gateway to a more enlightened perspective on yourself and life as a whole. Changing your focus is the key  what you expose yourself to and the things you choose to think about will alter your path as you move forward  if you continue thinking the things you think now you will have the same experiences youre having now as well. My recommendation Meditate. Read books by Jiddu Krishnamurti and Alan Watts. Go for walks without music or company. Spend some time learning about how your mind works why you think what you think and how you can move beyond it. It is possible  and I say that from experience. ,selfhelp,d6szr1u,1,t5_2qho7
9206372,0,t3_5668lh,It sounds like you have a habit of selfsabotage. People do this for all sorts of reasons. Some for attention. Some because they crave being able to get a predictable result when they take a certain action like not listening. Im not sure why you are doing but I may be able to help. If you really dont want to lose your partner Id suggest being totally honest with him. Tell him you dont want to lose him and that you love and appreciate him. And ask him what you can do to help save the relationship. And then DONT JUST LISTEN ACT on what he says.This can be hard you have to own your shit! But its key.  Try to be the person that you want to be with. And try to be an employee that you would want to employ. At the end of the day you have to  commit to not only listen to good advice but ACT ON IT. Put reminders in your phone on your desk write out your goals and act on them every day. You have to make a conscious decision to no longer live the way you are living now because you know it doesnt work. Hope this helps! ,selfhelp,d8iz5z4,2,t5_2qho7

9863083,0,t3_5flf05,Hey. I know a lot of my friends that have the same problem as you. I was fortunate enough to stumble upon the book Mastery by Robert Greene. Besides teaching the secrets of masters like Leonardo Da Vinci Thomas Edison etc. in the first chapter he teaches us how to find our purpose in life or in the book he calls it Natural Inclination. So basically you need to remind yourself what did you wanted to do as a child? What did you enjoy doing? Think deeply. Before being influenced by others in what field did you enjoyed spending your time?In my case after thinking for days as a kid I loved math. And I though Oh well I guess academia was my purpose. But as I took programming in college I realized that it wasnt math It was clear to me that it was solving problems that I enjoyed doing. I couldnt spend  hours sleeping but I was able to spend  hours coding and now Its a lot easier to find work that I enjoy. I also like selfdevelopment because in essence I need to solve problems that I currently have. So just think how you enjoyed spending your childhood and think of a deeper connection  Math and Coding have connection with Problem Solving  Maybe as a child you had a lemonade stand you enjoy selling stuff and helping others or you was writing short poems so you want to express your feelings and the feelings of others or maybe you enjoyed building out of nothing. The answer lies in your childhood. ,selfhelp,dat6ks0,2,t5_2qho7

10721047,0,t3_5swg2r,First off Id like to say yes people do change. Life is constantly changing however most of us wish for life to be constant stable unchanging. In that belief we try to find security we cling on an idea or image of this life we want and hold on ever so tight. Society tells us how we should act how our lives should be and how we should live so we bow down and listen. So our lives become stagnent thinking we must live our lives this way as it must be the only way. I say to you to not fear change it may be just what you need. Relationships between anyone is a two way journey. If only one person is paddling in the boat of two that individual will soon tire. Your spark and love for one another may have dimmed from what it once was and for many couples this is quite a common occurance.  When life becomes stagnent or not what we hoped it would be we soon grow weary. What I would suggest  trying is to face the issues. Speak to your spouse confront the problems. However come from a space of love and compassion as opposed to a space of anger and contempt. Listen closely to what each of you have to say. When you truly put your attention to it you will be amazed at what answers you may find. We all want a flourishing fufilling relationship its natural for us. However a relationship should never stop you from feeling fufilled in whatever hopes and dreams you had. Whatever it may be we all need to understand that life is all one all parts of it. Work life social life home life my life or your life is all but the same life. When we begin to see this way we come to a space of unity of true love. When we see ourselves in others around us. This compassion is what love is suppose to be. Love is not fear greed attachment lust or a demand that someone must do or give you anything. True love is unconditional. When we truly understand love we all change and when we change those around us will as well. All your answers are within you. Let go of any fear and doubt. All it takes is one step in the right direction to change your life.,selfhelp,ddlsoxz,1,t5_2qho7
