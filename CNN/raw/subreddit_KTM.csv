10272897,0,t3_5n16pm,Ive got a  xc. Its the first  stroke Ive owned since the days of my old cr which was about  years ago. I love it. Being in Australia I mostly ride technical single trail and I wouldnt want any other bike. Previously I was on a sxf and just decided that after all my mates were on s it just didnt have enough power. Since I bought the  two of my mates have bought them as well haha,KTM,dc8hm49,1,t5_2vdni

I mean there are only so many systems on the bike.  But I have no specifics about this bike and things to look out for.  I know dude was pretty pumped to be riding his  for a year...  sorry I cant be more help.,KTM,defspsz,1,t5_2vdni
