That said they shouldnt be using GB a month to download.I also doubt that it is using that much to upload but I suppose anything is possible.How complex is your home environment?  Do you have a lot of devices?  Is it possible someone is using the wifi without your knowledge to dump a bunch of stuff or stream a lot of HD video???,Suddenlink,dfnaijt,1,t5_30ikl
