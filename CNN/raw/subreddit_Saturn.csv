8891819,0,t3_521tgq,From Wikipediagt On October   Cassini witnessed the aftermath of the massive Great White Spot storm that recurs roughly every  years on Saturn. Data from the composite infrared spectrometer CIRS instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of Saturn  K  C  F above normal. Simultaneously a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by NASA researchers at Goddard Research Center in Greenbelt Maryland. Ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on Saturn and is produced both naturally and through manmade sources on Earth. The storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on December   in Saturns northern hemisphere. The storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around Saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths allowing scientists to observe the temperature of Saturns atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were  times more than those thought possible for Saturn. Scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the Solar System initially being larger than Jupiters Great Red SpotHattip to uthatnerdguy,Saturn,d7go5d4,3,t5_2t8ap
