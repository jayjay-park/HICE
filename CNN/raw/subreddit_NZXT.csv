542736,0,t1_cg1yj4c,You COULDconnect the CPU fan to the CPU fan header on your board and the hub to another pin on your motherboard.We do NOT suggest plugging the hub into the motherboard since it very well could overload your board. But there have been a decent amount of people connecting the hub with just the stock fans on rbuildpac and other forums. But because the disparities in max wattage between the hub and the motherboard header we do not cover this by warranty as it would be considered intentional misuse if you put a full load of W on the hub and tried to plug it into the header that at most gives W. With stock fans this shouldnt be a problem as our fans only give off about .W IIRC but we still do not guarantee this works since every board and fan is different. ,NZXT,cg1yrky,2,t5_2sszd

Spark on a  pin I dont even know  all I can guess is that there was a conductor shorting between pins.

3033122,0,t1_cn5u04l,Hi did you manage to find out what the clicking sound was caused by? The same issue appeared with my X after a month of usage. The clicking sound was coming from the pump when I switched to silent mode in CAM and also all the time when the fan speed was set below   the pump went a bit faster with that settign too. What I did was change changng a BIOS setting which controlled the cpu fan speed  from DC to PWM. Now the pump works with  bit higher rpm and no clicking and I can set the fans to  in CAM again.,NZXT,cocdqnp,1,t5_2sszd

9284182,0,t1_d8sr7je,Like I said some may consider that to be too much if they only want simple Kraken control. Since CAM is doing much more than that for me Id say MB is very small under  of my total RAM. Plus that was just the high end of CAMs usage now that Im home I see that Im jumping around between MB and MB which is less than some Google Chrome background processes and only a slight bit more than Javas SE binary.The massive resource use Im referring to is those who have CAM using over a GB of RAM which is certainly unacceptable.,NZXT,d8su5qh,0,t5_2sszd

10147863,0,t1_dbu99j5,Even at C something is not right. Your radiator fans are spinning yes? They spin up with cpu load?What motherboard do you have? I have an ASUS ZA which has a dedicated pump header so you can control the water pump from the bios. How are you controlling the pump and fans? Are you using NZXT CAM?I dont have an AIO so the first thing I did was try to get vcore under control because the stock voltage at .V was insanely high. So I changed auto vcore to adaptive. Then I went to additional turbo core voltage and stepped this down gradually from .V in .V increments to .V.I expected this to only affect vcore in turbo boost clocks but it ended up functioning like a negative voltage offset at all step down voltageclock speed pairings. i.e. when speedstep drops the clocks to  mhz in idle state vcore also dropped from .V stock to .V.But your x is underperforming relative to my miniature air cooler so something else is not right. It cant just be auto vcore. Do you have load line calibration on?,NZXT,dbu9pac,2,t5_2sszd

10258022,0,t3_5mm1y1,NZXT needs to fire everyone in the software dev department and hire people who actually know how to fix things. Ive had mine since last january and have an extension kit with it.

I would really put in a lot of effort to make a really good video and guide for others as Im sure lots of enthusiasts and even regular folks would be interested in this I would also love to work with NZXT in developing an official version too as I think its something the really suits them and I have so many ideas in this field.

10872051,0,t3_5ve4ei,Firstly that window is insanely easy to scratch. I took mine to a LAN party and was very cautious every step of the way to make sure the glass didnt scratch. Of course it happened anyway and I have no idea how. I did a little research and saw someoen made a post about replacing the window with glass. Heres what I did to solve this issue. I went to the local glass shop and ordered a x piece of glass for  bucks. I believe it was that size double check. Tempered was much more expensive. I got inch but that was too thick I made it work by cutting the the little tabs that hold the side panel on theyre not needed after you screw it in. All I used was silicon glue to hold the window in place. Its been a few months and my window looks crystal clear and no more easy scratches! ,NZXT,de1dhtd,2,t5_2sszd
