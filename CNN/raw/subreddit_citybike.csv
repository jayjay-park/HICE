1856911,0,t3_2fs75t,New wheels arent necessary as tires can be significantly wider than the rim.Its not clear from the photo but it looks like you might not have that much clearance for larger tires. Youll need to measure how much clearance you have and work out how big a tire you can go for or go to a decent bike shop where they can advise you about how big you can go.Your drive train looks like its in pretty good condition so why not ride it until it wears out and then switch to a hub gear?The path Id follow to turn your bike into a city bike is get the largest tires your frame has clearance for. Swtich to north road or flat bars this will also necessitate new brake levers and depending upon how you like the bike to handle a different reach stem you existing shifters should be fine though.Use the existing drivetrain till it wears out then upgrade to a hub gear.Unless its extremely dry where you live mud guardsfenders are pretty much a necessity. You would have issues with clearance though.,citybike,ckcybbq,1,t5_2zd50
3016038,0,t3_2un01s,Based on a post on rcitybike a while back I ordered a low drag XT hub from rose.de as well as a BampM light I had been lusting over for years.I am very pleased with the purchase and the only thing I could ask would be to remove the handlebar switchUSB completely to keep the light on always.Low drag  LED is the way to go my LBS has prebuilt sanyo hub wheels for as little as ,citybike,coalzq9,4,t5_2zd50

3513070,0,t3_30i80t,This is a great versatile classic italian bike. Its not a racer but youre going to get exercise riding any bike. The gearing on that bike is great for hills.Bianchi is a very sought after name... if you buy this make sure to get a descent lock. If you live in an urban area definitely also ask about locking skewers or a cable to thread through the wheels. Would hate to see someone walk off with those. ,citybike,cpspra5,2,t5_2zd50
4209017,0,t1_crzyq69,Ive just looked at the Sheldon Brown article for which you provided a link and found that it really doesnt speak to the issue at hand.,citybike,cs00kpm,1,t5_2zd50
4225369,0,t1_cs1ufvs,But youve not proven that.Find me a derailleur equipped commuter of a similar price to the Coffee that doesnt have greater range and Ill buy you a drink.I had a Dutch three speed I was jamming the wheels from it into an old Peugeot last night. My mountain bike has an  speed hub. You dont have to make stuff up to try and get people to like hub gears.Just be honest. They have some advantages and they have some disadvantages.,citybike,cs1vbjc,1,t5_2zd50
5227181,0,t1_cvff859,I dream of getting a trailer! But the only ones I can find here are so expensive that it completely puts me off. I have my basket and two great big panniers plus I live alone so I dont tend to carry that much stuff. It just would be nice to be able to go a trip to Costco and not have to compare the size of what Im buying with my bags!,citybike,cvg2eje,2,t5_2zd50

9763319,0,t3_5dvbp7,Great call on Public in ueobanbs comment. Incidentally their V is now going for  although I realize thats a stretch.OP could you share a few more details? Where and for what will you be riding especially in terms of terrain distance weather and cargo? Any unique considerations e.g. are carrying it up many flights of stairs? Is it feasible to save up for a little while longer? If so how would that affect your budget? How tall are you? Probably not a big issue unless youre at least a couple standard deviations in either direction. Whats your overall fitness level and cycling experience if any at all? Do you have any bikesavvy friends whod be willing to help you out? Are you mechanically inclined?,citybike,dagjod6,1,t5_2zd50
9792984,0,t3_5fgd2v,Yeah that chart just looks wrong and its inconsistent with standards. I think its a typo. Id go as big as your rims and frame will permit. At the same pressure bigger tyres actually have lower rolling resistance and theyre safer and smoother. I love my Marathon Supremes which are gtmm,citybike,dak74jp,3,t5_2zd50

11364491,0,t1_dfk4uld,Yeah carrying it like that is definitely doable. Just saying that a frame handle makes it easy to carry it like this which is even easier. Also the sec search I did for that photo lead me to these frame handles on Aliexpress for  I cant speak to quality but it seems like a good deal.  ,citybike,dfk56cl,1,t5_2zd50
