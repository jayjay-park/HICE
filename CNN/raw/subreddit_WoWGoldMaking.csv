1222910,0,t3_283wl8,You have many options  some easier than others.    See if your competitor will agree to whitelist.  Dont approach him all testy and annoyed.  Be friendly chat a bit about the markets ask his advice on something commiserate over other annoying competitors.  Dont be an ass.  You are far more likely to come to a whitelist agreement and maybe make a friend! if he knows you are not a douchebag.If that doesnt work or youve already burnt that bridge or you simply dont like to whitelist then Check his heat map on theunderminejounal.com.  Use that data to find an optimal time to post your auctions and formulate a strategy.  .  If hes online and active all day and night then I would not waste my time with undercutting wars  I would just drive the market down to a barely profitable price point post a wall and then do other stuff like diversifying  .  If he has large windows of time where he is offline or raiding use that to your advantage.  Drive the market as close to crafting cost as you can then after he logs off for the night buyout his stock and reset the market.  He may post walls before logging off  use caution when buying out walls.  Dont do it unless the price is super close to crafting cost.  This close to the end of MoP you dont want to end up with a huge stockpile of unsold outdated enchants when WoD hits.Diversify your markets! Every server is different but if you do some research on Undermine Journal you should be able to find some profitable markets.  Some possiblities might include.  Alchemy  if you are xmute spec see if transmuting gems like tiger opal to vermilion onyx or twink gems is profitable.  Look for profitable niche items like Frost Oil invisibility potions elixirs of giant growth etc.  .  JC  keep learning your cuts.  Ghost Iron shuffle probably isnt that profitable anymore but check it out just in case.  .  Tailoring  do your daily cooldown and make a  piece whenever you can.  Its not huge profit but should be steady. Look into the  gear market to see if any of it is profitable.  Look into low level twinktransmog gear.  Black embersilk gown admirals hat lumberjack shirts mooncloth robe winter veil and festival attire etc.  And of course bags  if you dont have the rep for the luxurious silk gem bag get it.  And dont forget to do your dreamcloth CDs once a week.. Flipping  this is one of my favorites.  I use a couple different ways to find deals.  You can use Wowuctions bargain hunter tool.  Make sure to check all the tabs not just the weapons tab.  The data on that site is sometimes a little old so if you want live data you will need to do a search in game.  I use TSM Shopping and do searches on recipe armor and weapon and scan through the items that are  of market value to see if anything is worth buying and flipping.Well thats a huge wall of text.  Got a little carried away.  Hope you found something useful there.Good luck!,WoWGoldMaking,ci77272,6,t5_2sdah

1647534,0,t3_2bj141,Sorry for a late response but if you are still looking for advice on what to do with all your Ink of Dreams can you can also bulk trade in for the other inks used in creating glyphs so that you dont have to worry about overpriced low tier herbs since they tend to inflate due to limited supply during expansion leveling rushes and people changing or leveling up their professions. ,WoWGoldMaking,cjmu2wu,2,t5_2sdah

2213253,0,t3_2kf2ly,Really if its WhiteGrey item color its probably not worth it.The two items I can think of that do sell for a lot that are White quality are Dark Iron Leather transmog and Haunted Memento no longer attainable in game.As stated before making any purchases you are unsure of check wowuction or The Undermine Journal.If you have TSM set up you can also see RealmRegionGlobal prices for the items to see if they are inline with the general market.,WoWGoldMaking,cll5otx,2,t5_2sdah
