204235,0,t1_cf1pb64,If youre comfortable reading Danish this explains it pretty well. Tldr Originally it was so but since  the rule was changed so it is now okay to use meget in places where megen would have been used. Today almost everybody except some very old people only uses meget.,danishlanguage,cf1pfg6,4,t5_2wjcu

5498530,0,t3_3qem7b,Most people dont frequent any forums and those that do typically prefer English ones. Instead most people comment on things on Facebook or Ekstra Bladets Nationen Go to Nationen if you want to find out how to spell every single word wrong while taking stabs at muslims.Nonetheless here are some Danish forums I can think of Amino.dk Forum for entrepreneurs. HesteNettet.dk Used to be?? one of the most active forums in Denmark. Mainly consists of yearold girls who like horses. If you google anything in Danish that might somehow interest this demographic there will be a link to HesteNettet on the first page of results. There is also Hestegalleri.dk. Pokernet.dk For poker players but many topics are covered. Bodybuilding.dk Quite active although you probably wont find any cats there. Minmave.dk Popular among mothers and pregnant women. You might find cats there but probably no games other than Ludo. BilGalleri.dk BilGalleri ScooterGalleri TraktorGalleri and so on are all quite active or used to be no idea. Find links to the other galleries on the top of the BilGalleri page. bold.dksnak Football.EDIT There is also Dailyrush.dk about computerrelated topics.,danishlanguage,cwehmg6,4,t5_2wjcu

8820172,0,t1_d77vxpt,gt  you need to be more than fluent it has to be universitylevel fluent and you kind of have to be taught that because you wont learn about these complicated parts of the language from everyday interactions.I am studying datalogi computer science at university and Ive lived in Denmark my entire life. I was always the best or one of the best at English and Danish throughout most of my time in school and yet I still encounter lots of sentences I have a hard time understanding during the lectures at university or when I read the books that we use. There are just lots of new words that I cant remember ever seeing before and reading about computer science can be difficult enough on its own. Reading about it on university level with lots of new words and in another language seems very very difficult to me. On top of that some professors are just difficult to understand. I had a professor once who was really really difficult to understand during all his lectures because he stuttered tried yelling but his voice kept cracking he spoke too fast and slurred all of his words together. For example rrausivt  rekursivt and  amossehrt td  amortiseret tid. Most of what he said had to be understood from context and guessing. His explanations were just plain bad as well spending  minutes trying to explain an algorithm in some strange way that any Indian guy on YouTube could explain coherently and in great detail in  minutes. On top of all this what he was talking about was just incredibly difficult to begin with. Something about amortized time and loop invariants in recursive algorithms. You will have professors like this from time to time. Theres a good chance you might not learn enough Danish to understand them anytime soon and in those cases you need to be really good at reading since youll learn most of the curriculum by reading the book rather than watching the lecture. But fortunately almost all books are in English so in that regard you might be fine. To be fair there a lots of students here that dont speak very much Danish but a good amount of them seem to understand some amount of Danish. And they usually get pretty good grades as well. So its not impossible for you but I just want you to know that you might encounter some frustrating things. ,danishlanguage,d782bcl,1,t5_2wjcu
