Everything else you have said you literally admit to being worse than speculative math.... its just anecdotes. If you heard anything you would have heard actual numbers. The event sold out. That means it had a finite number of people. The reason it is less than center concert capacity is because its not safe for drugged out kids to be on the upper level balconies. Thats why they closed them off and covered them with cloth. I told you the approximate within  number of remaining seats that were in available sections. Whether or not the Bassnectar Crew and Bridgestone agreed to sell that number of tickets is unknown. Just saw your link. Are you not aware that that doesnt include fanclub and vip?

4282811,0,t3_39t3au,This was my th Nectar set and it was ABSOLUTELY FUCKING FANTASTIC. He played  newunreleased music and newunreleased remixesmashups.  The fact that I could hardly recognize any of the songs but still fell in love with all of them just furthers my love for Lorins music. Im sure Ill be listening until the day he puts the decks away. Its always a pleasure no matter how long he played. Did I want a  hour Nectar set? Of course. Was I disappointed by this Bonnaroo set? HELL FUCKING NO. Visually I thought EZOO  was a bit more impressive Ive still never seen screens that big to this day. However this really felt like a set for both new fans and old lovers.  He played a lot of the stuff that people will be hearing in the near future from him as well as a few gems like Yes and Pennywise Tribute. A lot of newer and brand new music yes but  a fantastic set the entire way through. Opening with Were off to see the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz remixing We Dem Boiz into a GOOD song O.o and closing with that new Generate track... It was Nectar through and through. I had a similar experience to this during this set actually a st time Nectarino asked me close to the end of the set Does he always play Bass Head? To which I had to respond No sweetie Im sorry  Hes not always going to play the bubblegum or the stuff that every wants to hear because hes already been playing it for years.  If you do hear an old song or a new version of an old song consider yourself lucky and cherish the experience.  Did I hear Pink Elephants at Bonnaroo? No but I heard it on my Birthday at Moonrise last year and Ive heard it in  or  other sets so I can remember those experiences.  It makes me bummed to hear that people are complaining about such an amazing set if you wanna see more of him then go to more shows XD,bassnectar,cs8e4ky,4,t5_2syh0

4494529,0,t1_csx6t0i,I mean to be fair Tennessee is the  state in America in terms of violent crime per capita so I guess its a step up. The reality is despite his public statements against the use he is FULLY aware of how indelible drug use is to his fanbase and culture. Hes not stupid. Holding a huge once a year extravaganza in the middle of a deep red right wing conservative state with higher than average arrest rates and LIFE IN PRISON for an ounce of marijuana?Theres a difference between making a tour stop there once ever? and holding a cherished traditional once a year event there. A huge difference. Its the difference between people traveling all across the country usually with drugs and travelling across a state or county line or two.  I appreciate your concern for sensitivity and political correctness but it is flat out irresponsible to take  bassheads who are guaranteed to be bringing and using mass quantities of drugs into one of the most vicious and reprehensible justice systems in America.You can get mad and call me names all you want.

I didnt see it at the time but it was affecting my relationships and the people I loved the most.

10871426,0,t1_ddr4797,hi there!! a few responses below  bigger doesnt necessarily mean better is an opinion while in some cases depending on the artist i agree with this statement Lorin  the Bassnectar Crew as a whole are interested in throwing events that are more immersive and inclusive  we like to push limits and try new things which is a good thing!! and the beauty of being an artist is that you get to determine how your art is shared with others  we have lots of other special features at our events  we have the Ambassadors passing out ear plugs  water The Haven where you can get away to relax or grab a snack or do an art project we set up charitable drives and donations  in AC we will also have a gift alter and other creativeinteractive zones set up for Bass Heads to enjoy!! sure lots of peeps fly but TONS carpool as well  if you cant afford a flight hit up the Bass Network on Twitter so they can help link you with someone in your area  we are developing new ways to link Bass Heads with one another and connect more peeps looking for rideshares and places to stay at BN eventsand how can someone define what makes for the most incredible experiences? that is entirely subjective and differs from person to person  what you think is incredible may not be what i think is incredible. not sure how my insight applies to your viewsopinions dont think theres been a confetti blast to Zodgilla and dont believe we had balloons in ATL last yearand sure peeps go for Lorins sets but the supporting cast for AC is legit!! dont see any issues with the lineupno apologies needed  youre entitled to feel how you feel! just please keep in mind that we do all we can to include as many fans as possible while also keep ticket prices as low as possiblehope to see you out at a show soon  ,bassnectar,de1b6a2,1,t5_2syh0

And as for the dress code the EDM bubble has pretty much burst in Vegas and clubs are desperate so they have a lax dress code policy now for EDM shows. Saw Skrillex many times there last year in my jeans. Although Id probably dress up for Nectar because I like to get fancy sometimes ,bassnectar,df3gt01,2,t5_2syh0

11527702,0,t1_dg2m845,Im sure thats part of it but slowing down after a while in life is a very real thing. Plus after going to tons of shows and festivals over the course of a few years they start to lose their fresh excitement. You know what to expect around nearly every corner.Admittedly Ive started to feel this way. Yes its all still very fun but Ive lost my desire to travel  hours by car and spend a ton of money just to attend a special event or go to a far away festival. Ill always go to Electric Forest and any Bassnectar show in Michigan and probably the surrounding states because those are close for me but all that travel time and money spent going to something far away doesnt get me as big of a return on investment these days.,bassnectar,dg2o0pj,8,t5_2syh0

11562751,0,t1_dg6g86g,I had a good time because the lineup was so fire. Depends what you want out of a festival. If you just want lineup and stage production its not a bad move. If youre worried about holding hands singing kumbayah and frills then dont. But if the lineup is as insane as it was last year Im going again.,bassnectar,dg6n5az,1,t5_2syh0
