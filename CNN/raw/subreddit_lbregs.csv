3091904,0,t1_coigoia,i can live with it just so long as it stays out of the rmflb open forum. and what most folk dont understand is that subreddits are run as the top mod wants it run under reddiquette.  submissions and comments are voted on but do not run the sub. so yes it is my sub and it is running exactly the way i have always wanted it to run. i have auditioned others for moderator but none yet have had my direction in mind or the patience and perseverance for a mod that the type of sub like rmflb is requires.,lbregs,coih3cw,-3,t5_31ucf

As for rigid control ever hear of tough love? Soft love only goes so far so if you really love someone you have to show them tough love as well.

4110496,0,t3_37ap15,Fun fact.  Almost every hardware store sells plastic and rubber tubing that you buy by the foot.  Personally I prefer plastic since you can see the vapor and I think it cleans easier...  Oh I just slide the plastic tubing over the glass stem its a little loose but I like how it works.

5444181,0,t1_cw7696x,Idk man Im just a really cautious person. Theres a small chance that some really antiweed cop will walk past your car in a parking lot and happen to know what an MFLB is. Im assuming that you sometimes carry weed in your car and Im not  sure if this is true or not but I think a cop can say that a bumper sticker is probable cause to search your vehicle. Now the chances of this are slim to none but Id rather not take the chance.,lbregs,cw7jotq,1,t5_31ucf
