1980895,0,t3_2hc89b,To me the bishop always looked like it was zooming so fast diagonally that his legs bent back and his hat was about to go flying off his head!The silver looks like half of a gold thus silver is less valuable than gold.The lance kind of looks like a lance to me  YMMV.The Rook kind of looks like a capital R for Rook or a capital H which kind of describes its orthogonal moves.Pawns look like With the horse promoted bishop you can see its four little legs running under it.The dragon promoted rook looks badass enough that it has to be a dragon.All other promoted pieces are essentially gold generals.That leaves the knight and I have no mnemonic to help other than it has to be a knight if you rule out everything else.,shogi,ckrwd47,1,t5_2rkeb
