1440956,0,t3_2anfwh,There was something vaguely familiar about her and it put Anna on edge. It was a disconcerting recognition uncanny almost as if she had known the woman in another life. Of course Anna had lived as many lives as a thricecharmed cat. It would take weeks to sift through her sea of contacts to know if she had in fact worked with the woman before. Yet her con instincts werent telling her to run quite the opposite. The blonde wasnt dangerous just... intriguing.,stolenicemasterrace,ciwwf42,3,t5_32hkg

1747185,0,t1_cjzdqp0, Gosh uhm I have no idea. Honestly I think Id just watched Chicago at that point... Im pretty sure theres a Chicago reference in some chapter. Sun and moon well this is a story about negotiating opposites. Things being together that shouldnt. Things not working when they are together. Or maybe working. Well have to see. And I liked the sun thing for Anna. And her identity crisis in aligning with the sun being Icarus all that jazz Chicago Reference I still dont know the answer to that ten months later. Because Im already swimming in debt. I actually googled books about AANA but never purchased one. The most popular one seemed to be riddled with inaccuracies as it was marketed as a nonfiction account but anecdotes in it were completely made up. Ill have to check it out!,stolenicemasterrace,cjze5bg,10,t5_32hkg
1747741,0,t3_2egtjr,Im never sure how long to make intimate scenes kissing holding hands little dorky whispers that sort of thing last. On one hand its fluff at its fluffiest and if its wellwritten it can go on for a bit but on the other hand I can only speak for myself so... Do you have any advice in that regard? I also have difficulty coming up with a theme for intimate scenes or making them not feel pointless or arbitrary.,stolenicemasterrace,cjzgnuv,2,t5_32hkg
