Im a working mom with middle school and up kids think a metric crap ton of sports school activities etc. and I still only spend maybe  hours a week on it if that Im lazy.I dont know where you are geographically but in our area we have stores that double the face value of coupons. It really really helps especially if you can match the coupons up with sales prices.If youre looking for healthier options while couponing there are some sites out there that specialize in organic items like Mambo Sprouts And you can occasionally find meat coupons if you dont mind brands like Smithfield. Theyll sometimes put out coupons for pork loins which we do on our grill.If you ever have questions feel free to PM me. I started couponing about oh five years or so ago. I have no idea how we made it before I started couponing given how much were saving.Oh one last thing  if you want to save some additional money you may want to check out sites like SavingStar You will have to put in loyalty card numbers but their coupons dont require anything else. Load the coupon on their site very easy buy the item at a store where you have a loyalty card that youve registered get cash back. Once you hit  you can choose to have them send it back to you in cash. I use it to feed my Starbucks habit LOL. ,couponing,cp6tbfm,3,t5_2rhjx
