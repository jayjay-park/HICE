Fixed! And I think it ended up looking even better in the processThe tabs are supposed to look like ribbon bookmarks in a book and have been the most difficult element to style in this whole thing.,7thSea,d1b701a,2,t5_2xwp6

7826159,0,t1_d3vj451,You know why it isnt difficult to port schools from e to e?  Because youre dumbing them all down to a singular ability of identity.  It isnt hard to point at any school say yes this ability will work take that from it and then discard the rest.  whats hard is to add depth to keep that same depth across systems.  I wouldnt be surprised if someone ports all e schools to e and does it just fine.. because its easy.  But at the same time by doing that youll probably lose something about  of the schools because a large majority of them wereare about more than just ONE thing.  Thats what made them interesting in the first place.For your example Boucher school you admit right off the bat to the following There is no distinction with offhands and that benefit is moot The bonus specifically against active defenses doesnt matter and is moot Initiative is still important but cant be messed with as easily Boucher Step keeps the flavor of wielding two small fast weaponsBut what you lose Unique attack knack specific to double knife work and a total of four schools out of  Ability to better bypass a specific type of defense active because of your quicker attacks An ability to get a DD and actively defend in a unique way with DoubleParry centipede strike a flurry attack which bypasses active defense entirely and goes off purely their passive defense and hits them continuouslyThat school is cool.  Hands down it has unique offense and defense abilities and a special attack at mastery along with a cool theme dualwielding knives.  e dumbs it where your weaponry doesnt matter you can do it with one knife as long as the other hand is free even and the only thing the school advantage gives you now is you can do two maneuvers at once but it cant be the same maneuver twice so.. its either going to be slash  lunge or riposte  lunge if you dont win initiative pretty much every time just because thats the best offensive options available.  And none of what youre doing is unique to you or your fighting style youre just able to do a second maneuver out of order.. which is inherently limitedpunished by the system because you cant do the same one twice to simply slashslash even.Also do you really think that ANYONE can feel that different from eisenfaust when Iron Reply is a straightup addition to Riposte meaning that their signature thing is done by everyone they just do it better they dont even get an additional usage of it for doing it differently or normal riposte  special?Also Eisenfaust is a perfect example of another neutered school though Boucher worked just fine for that  Their signature thing was waiting for an opening.  When their opponent misses them they can punish it and they can gain bonuses by holding their actions to capture their opponents weapon preventing them from using it altogether which means they have to swap to a different weapon or get bent and breaking them even.  And all that the panzerhand and the broadsword style the reading your opponent and capitalizing on their mistakes the locking of their weapon.. is reduced to a round riposte.How far Eisenfaust fell.,7thSea,d3vq68e,2,t5_2xwp6
7896443,0,t1_d43h931,The drama is in the situation. Since you roll first and then you spend the raises you dont actually know if you have enough. As your pool goes down if the GM is doing a good job of telling the story your tension naturally ramps up.Consider it with another way. Say you were a thief robbing a nobles manor. You make your stealth check and get  raises.You spend  raise to case the joint and find a way in.You spend a nd raise to sneak in the back door bypassing most of the guards.Now youre on the right floor and the GM mentions that there are more guards than you expected up here  almost like theyre waiting for you. You can spend a raise to bypass them and your th raise to open the safe but then youre out of raises to get back out of the house. Alternatively you could back off now and leave empty handed. Or you could sneak past the guards and see if the next challenge is the safe  saving your last raise to either escape undetected or open the safe if it is there.In that moment of decision you have drama because you have a finite number of resources to spend to get in get the goods and get out. Compare to the base system where either the whole heist is  roll and you make it or fail meh. Or you just end up rolling check after check until you make it or fail and each time are wondering why the GM is having you keep rolling dice.If the GM wants you to fail no matter the game they can make you fail. The extra drama from the dice in second edition comes from the fact that you generate a pool of successful actions first and then have to spend that pool to hopefully overcome the challenges the situation has ready for you.,7thSea,d43mtey,2,t5_2xwp6

8144356,0,t3_4qqyjw,If youre planning on a National Treasure style run from location to location to get cluesmap pieces then if it starts to drag on have another team show up and get ahead of your players to drive them to go faster.. Or have the other team accidentally give your team a clue to speed up the current scene. Be willing to skip a scene or section entirely or combine the actions of two scenes into one. If you get good at this you can make  scenes fill a night easily.  A simple but complex enough for an evening session that Id run would go like this... Three surviving members of a bitter merchant crew go to three separate groups of people your heroes being one group and inform them of an unspecified lost treasure with a complex past that their recently deceased captain had told them about. The three groups independently decide to track it down and meet at the first piece of the puzzle the church that the captain helped build in the last year of his life. The intricate carvings of the ceilingwallswhatever give clues as to where the map is... The very captains grave on the abnormal island on the edge of the legendary th Sea where he died it seems. Upon arrival to the island set up any number of obstacles and when they do get there either dig up the captain and use Hexenwerk to investigate or otherwise search the body or hide the map onin the grave marker... But its a sort of blueprint of one of the Vodacce Princes personal ships and theres an x directly over the wheel mast anything really. Any teams that learn this information still need to deal with each other and try to either assault of infiltrate the princes ship for the last piece. You can go as stealthcombatsocialbribery as you want to get to the marker and then break open the wheel of the ship to find a simple green marble which is an artifact that will roll toward the last place that it was dropped regardless of gravity or angle.  Right you broke a piece of a royal ship. Um run. This marble was last dropped at the site of the treasure and kept here to prevent anyone from messing with it. Whoever had it before was unable or unknowing of what it is the captain could never get his hands on it or tried and thats how he died. Put the marble In a box and itll roll toward one side keep going that direction until the marble suddenly stops rolling and youre abovebelow the treasure. Dig it up then fight off or evade the other team until youre free to look upon your booty!...great now Im probably going to run this. ,7thSea,d4vl9jo,5,t5_2xwp6

8960450,0,t3_52b78q,This disfigurement basically boils down to the fact that its impossible to kill someone accidentally in SE. Thats because the choice to end a life is a core theme and removing it would remove the weight of that decision. So if thats a problem then this may simply not be the game for you.This is a thematic consideration not a political statement and treating it as such will only lead to the kind of hostility and conflict were seeing here. It does not reflect reality. It says nothing about how heroic authentic soldiers are. It does not make GMs who enforce these themes puritanical. And it is not a challenge to your personal values.ItsJustAGameSituations like this are why Im so passionately against using games to push personal politics or even suggesting they do and just assume they arent when I play them.,7thSea,d7owtuq,2,t5_2xwp6

Be nicer if the rules did say they Brutes minor NPCs were taken out like in games like Feng Shui or FATE and then you can decide how they are taken out if it matters at the time.I agree it isnt a major problem and I agree in principle with the idea of making murder matter just think it wasnt handled elegantly.,7thSea,d8f6vb5,0,t5_2xwp6
9574449,0,t3_5c28mw,Many many years ago I played in a st edition th Sea game John ran at a Con when the rules had just come out. It was a lot of fun and he was a good GM. He encouraged getting incharacter and doing odd or goofy things. During our fight with the suave dashing Montaigne villain John asked What do you do? I was playing a hairy uncouth pirate and yelled Arr! I be teachin him how to play Rochambeau! and said I was kicking the villain in the groin. John rolled the dice looked at the results and said The Villain goes OOOoohhheeee! and started making an outrageously exaggerated expression to show how the bad guy was feeling. We all cracked up. It was a good game and he autographed my character sheet. I think I still have it somewhere!,7thSea,d9t8vp1,3,t5_2xwp6
9792226,0,t1_daj26ba,I myself find the best way is not to beat the hero with the villain. It is great but they loathe even more one thing. That is fleeing with a maniacal laugh while endangering innocent bystanders lifes to cover their flight while laughting even harder and telling the hero they can never beat someone that will never play fair.They hate that a lot. Make them wanna murder this guy.Use them raise to wreak havoc flee ignore the puny hero trying to save everyone and use this against them.You always go first on the same raise anyway and you use them as you please dont play fair.A villain does not always use all their raise to beat the hero directly Usually hero are reacting to the villain and not the other way around. So if a villain is many raise ahead and you dont want to murder someone outright with  loaded pistol on your belt take that you insolent duelist let him follow his plan or do crazy villainous shit before having to turn to the hero. Or make an insane setup that threaten the heroes like activating many hidden trap throwing you into a shark pit instead of just slashing you to death or acting his hubris. So mechanicaly invent consequence delayed high amount of damage that will hurt the hero a lot if they dont react to it. For a villain especially in this cinematographic and romantic de cape et dpe settings why do thing simple when you can do them complicated with panache ?Remember villain do what they want with their risk let them cheat especially major villain with lot of influence they love that.,7thSea,dak3rom,1,t5_2xwp6

10993020,0,t3_5wyt45,Personally Id treat the Old Republic confusion similarly to the conflation of Hellenistic and Roman civilisation. The one Ancient Numa leads to the other The Old Republic. Given as were talking about NotGreece and NotItaly and Numas defining trait beyond being invaded on a weekly basis for a thousand years or so is their pantheon its not a huge stretch to assume the Vodaccebased Old Republic followed the same pantheon and had resultant cultural links.You could also treat it like the postAlexander split of the Macadonian Empire conflated with the EastWest Roman Empire split. A Numan Old Republic rises expands splits due to internal strife and the fragment that expands to reform an Empire is the one based in the Vodacce peninsula. Thus there is continuity of the Old Republic in the sense that the Byzantines were continuous with the Roman Empire.,7thSea,dee0vn2,1,t5_2xwp6
11079613,0,t3_5y7aqz,Well you can minimise the number of dice that the GM can buy off of you by how you make your sets to hit raises.A set of dice that rolls       could be matched up as     and leave two dice to be bought or it could be matched up as      and leave one die to be bought.  Obviously this gives you less hero points though.  If you really want you could matchup as    and    and leave no dice to be bought...  but that leaves no hero points to be earned.Those hero points can be spent to support other characters in later scenes so youre effectively trading a possibility of the GM being able to screw the party for being able to support a team mate at a critical juncture.  So in a sense the mechanic youre complaining about is an incentive to work together its just that the benefit is delayed until a later scene or whenever you use the hero point whereas the downside looks immediate although again its actually delayed until the point is used.I would ask though why is no one else selling dice at the same rate?   Are they just making less rolls and thus being less mechanically involved with the flow of the game or are they ending up with less spare dice?   Does the GM just not want their danger points?,7thSea,denv49y,6,t5_2xwp6
11151667,0,t1_dew0o7z,Also I would say that this game isnt for everybody. Every gm isnt going to play the game the way the game wants. Its not necessarily maturity but if you have a gm who constantly puts you in catch  situations see the old DND baby goblins dilemma thats not a good gm.
