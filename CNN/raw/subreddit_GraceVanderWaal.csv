10885982,0,t1_de25msy,Listening to todays Wednesday now.  Different tunes between the bumpers but its the same Grace content.  After listening to the whole show  Im not sure if all the bumper spots by Grace were repeated.  Parts of the show sounded familiar so maybe some of the tunes were repeated as well.  I thought she had specifically introd a few songs but I only heardnoticed the TP intro today.Good news is that if you catch the show one day this week it probably means you get the Grace experience and wont miss out.,GraceVanderWaal,de2t84r,2,t5_3eymh
