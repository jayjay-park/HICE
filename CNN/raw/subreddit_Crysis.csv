1823751,0,t3_2dhqab,I too had a problem with Alcatraz becoming prophet. although this is some how explained through a book it never was said how the nanosuit stored prophets mind amp memories. When he took off the nanosuit  it was evident that he had a undersuit so that he wouldnt get permanently attached to the suit meaning he had some knowledge of the suits symbiotic nature. So if he wore that to bot get connected with the suit completely  then how did it store his mind.,Crysis,ck8y9v7,1,t5_2rsfy

7009616,0,t1_d12q20z,Crysis  always had ridiculous performance with AA. It also has a lot more aliasing problems than other games of its time. I know CryEngine wasnt deferred but somehow it already had the characteristics of a deferred engine.If I were you and was still bothered by aliasing I would google if Sweetfx works with Crysis. Or maybe you could force SMAA via AMD driver. Good luck.,Crysis,d1avwry,1,t5_2rsfy
