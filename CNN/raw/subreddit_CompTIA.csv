3611601,0,t3_31pamy,There isnt any trick that Ive found except to drill on each individual one over and over again.For me it helped to vary the way the question was asked on practice tests that I created myself.  For instance instead of asking What port does TACACS use? I would change it up and ask What is port  used for? or You are asked to check your firewall to verify that a rule exists to allow TACACS traffic.  What port number are you looking for?  It may sound stupid because youre essentially asking the same thing just using different words but it really helped me.Also I would combine several port numbers on one question.  Something like You have been tasked with adding rules to your companys firewall to allow NTP SSH and FTP.  In that order what ports will you create rules for?  Then I would list a variety of choices one of which would read    and .And since I mentioned SSH I also found this question helpful You have been asked to allow SSH SCP and SFTP traffic to pass through your firewall.  What is the best way to do this?  One of the choices would be Allow port  but other choices would list three different port numbers.  Initially because  services were listed I naturally wanted to select an option that listed three different port numbers.Anyway...your mileage may very but experiment a lot and find out what works best for you.,CompTIA,cq3y5xe,2,t5_2skgs

You will also have a good number of questions that focus on troubleshooting and reallife practical knowledge.For the  be sure to have a good grasp on Windows operating systems as well as software troubleshooting. Those two sections alone make up over  of the objectives. Know your security and know your ports.For the  be sure that you have hardware down very well.

Since you said you want to go into Security then the CCNA will be pretty valuable there but you may want to get the CCNA Security specific version of it rather than the Routing and Switching variant. Other certs that may be helpful there are the Security CASP and CISSP certifications. Although keep in mind that there is no correct path in terms of certifications for the IT industry.

It is a great language to teach CompSci majors some conceptual material but it is unlikely to benefit you in the security world.  The most common coding language you will see is JavaScript.

8667731,0,t3_4ykgs0,I went to a tech college vocational school  month thing in the long long time ago and so my advice might be outdated.  I never felt there wasnt much in the classes I couldnt have learned on my own and a good  of the people got  certifications and only like  of us got all the ones we were supposed to.  Teachers mostly read from the book but a couple had some valuable real world experience but overall it was kinda scammy and it cost way too much. But for me I needed the schedule and people to be competitive with and against.  I was not self motivated but in a group I find it much easier to keep motivated.  Also one of the friends I made at school knew a lady who worked at a hospital who got him an interview which got him a job.  He in turn got me an interview which got me a job and a few months later we recommended another guy we went to school with and he ended up getting hired there as well. If k isnt a huge amount of money for you then a tech school might not be the worst idea.  It does have advantages and in the grand scheme of things k isnt that much if you get a career in IT. ,CompTIA,d6p34h9,0,t5_2skgs

I got access to CertMaster with a package CompTIA sold that included a pair of vouchers in case I needed to retake.

11647279,0,t1_dgg7sf3,gt Im gonna buy the textbook when it comes out though just because i study better with a physical bookDo you have more information on this? Thanks.Also What are you planning to use for Sec? September  seems like the perfect start date for me. Oh well like I said I cant complain. To be honest I am a bit confused on something since there are so many different CCNA optionsgt CCNA Cloud CCNA Collaboration CCNA Cyber Ops CCNA Data Center CCNA Industrial CCNA Routing and Switching CCNA Security CCNA Service ProviderCCNA Wireless.Would there be any point to getting more than one type of CCNA? For example CCNA Routing and Switching and CCNA Cyber Ops? Or CCNA Security and CCNA Cyber Ops? Their all different but their all only Associate level certs. I personally am trying to just be as well rounded as possible so thats why Im interested in more than one..,CompTIA,dgg8ede,1,t5_2skgs

11790549,0,t3_686n5j,I am the same way. Reading Mike Myers book and it takes a long time. And I dont like the fact that it switches from  and . I wish I knew at the start to read a book which focuses on  strictly and  separately. It would make taking the exam much easier. Ive been studying on and off for  months. Flash cards highlights videos exams on the iPhone professor messer notes I made from his videos. I need to focus two weeks and devote all my time to finish the book and take the exam. Going at a slower rate has helped my retain the info. Meh.....,CompTIA,dgwhybh,1,t5_2skgs
