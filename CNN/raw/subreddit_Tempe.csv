857530,0,t1_ch1qvhg,I think the phone had shuffled off this mortal coil. After charging trying iTunes the Siri again to attempt to call Mom  Siri replied that I had to be connected to the Internet. Owner must have cancelled phone service... So... now what do I do? My hope was a quick return to owner but it may be too late for that now. ,Tempe,ch1r8di,1,t5_2s2ml

1335774,0,t1_cijjq7a,gt Do police officers still have quotas?Its illegal for them to. Under the table? Who knows? But a thing to note the larger the agency the easier it is for that information to get out.More likely the police department is tired of people jaywalking in that area so they are enforcing it more heavily.,Tempe,cijw321,2,t5_2s2ml

3745722,0,t3_33avw7,Riazzis is pretty good for a non chain non downtown mill Italian dinner.Its my go to for a family dinner or even date night with my wife without going far from home. The clams make a great appetizer. Chicken Parm is excellent. The only complaint is they do a little something weird with their homemade meat ravioli the cheese is good. I think its nutmeg they put in the meat a little overpowering.Caseys has a great lunch special on most Saturdays and sometimes Sunday in their prime rib sandwich which is basically a nice cut of beef on a piece of bread with some sides for less than  bucks. Also have great shrimp cocktail. Their wings are decent too get a dozen half and half BBQ and half buffalo. Trust me... uohlongjohnsonn mentioned Rula where I have lunch every day. I call it liquid bread as it comes from a tap...But the food is indeed good. Shepherds Pie is really good sliders are good. Actually most everything there is good. My office is the second floor of Rula so its also pretty convenient.Mr Hunan for Chinese delivery. Tip dont order close to closing. They want to go home and it shows. But most nights its as close to east coast style Chinese as you can get.Boulders on broadway for trivia night lots of great beers. Dogfish Head Chicken Bruschette is my wifes favorite on the menu. Generally a pretty good place without being fancy. On the fancy side urobinaz mentioned house of tricks. Its OK and friend is the manager but I have to say its sometimes a little too over the top. I dont need a fucking mango chutney demi glace infused with essence of asparagus with a hint of juniper bush on my ny strip... Im a simple man. Instead I might go with the salt cellar. Not quite as close but I think its technically still in Tempe. Cool spot for a classier dinner.Venezias for pizza though NYPD new york pizza department now open on Millrd is pretty good.You should get a ton of responses about all the Thai and Middle Eastern places around too there are a bunch about but not my style.,Tempe,cqj8k0o,6,t5_2s2ml
