The tune was brought to Americas colonies by ScotsIrish immigrants who settled along the Appalachian Trail and added lyrics that mirrored their new lifestyle.As you can see all three songs are based on The Rose Tree...so we suddenly assume its based on the racist version?The article even goes on to saygtNow I have no idea whether or not Brownes racist reworking of Turkey in the Straw developed directly into the ice cream man song. But it is a historical fact that the melodyunder the title Zip Coonwas popularized by blackface minstrel shows.Though the tune was popularized by the traveling blackface minstrel shows claims like this are only made to stir up controversy and discontent.

One of the bullets hit his forehead exited his lower jaw then reentered his chest through the clavicle and was lodged in his third posterior rib. That means that his chest had to have been on the same plane as his head which to me sounds more like someone in a horizontal position. Yeah it could have been while he was falling but that means he got four shots as he was falling. I do believe Wilsons testimony that Brown charged at him there is blood on the ground farther away than his body which means he ran then turned back. But I also believe that he fired some of the shots from behind as Brown was running away and kept firing as he was falling or was down on his hands and knees. ,misc,cmcwc42,2,t5_2qjbr

8173499,0,t1_d4yuoa7,I totally understand being nostalgic about something thats an integral part of your childhood and I also understand the appeal of being able to pick out physical copies of something whether it be video games movies or whatever.I was born in  so its kind of the same story only that we didnt have many VHS tapes around the house at the time we mostly borrowed. I only started collecting physical media shortly after Sony won the war against HDDVD i have almost no DVDs except for some TV Shows I watched as a kid most of which were never released on BluRay anyways.As far as VHS goes even if I did have something you could call a collection I would probably not be be using those for actual viewing purposes anymore. I know some people keep them around and especially when you have some very rare stuff that didnt even make the transition to DVD then of course its worth keeping them around.Either way what I would end up doing with physical media of any format is I would try to get them onto my hard drive as a conventional media file as soon as possible. With DVD and BluRay you can do that without any loss in quality. The software I use in my case is Handbrake for the conversion to H. which is the most efficient way of compressing video down in size at any desired level of quality but of course you dont need to compress if you dont want to. Handbrake can also rip directly off the DVDs in most cases. If theres copyprotection on it you might have to do another step inbetween and I cant recommend any software here since theyre hardly legal in most countries but theyre out there. To get stuff off of BluRays I use MakeMKV which at the time of writing this is kind of freeish since its not out of beta yet but once it is finished it will be trialsoftware. So you can use it free for a month in any case which was enough time to go through my collection at a rate of about  movies per day.I have hardware which can turn a composite signal and therefore VHS into MPEG I think which of course is a lot less spaceefficient than what Handbrake gets me but if I had a movie on VHS that I couldnt get any other way then this is how I would do that.In the end what this all relates to is the last paragraph in your blogpost which puts your liking of physical media in relation with streamingservices like Netflix. I like physical media but not exactly for the part where you need to get off your ass and load the disctape into some device. I like it because it is physical evidence of me owning a copy of whatever it is thats on it. A little over a month ago was when I started realizing that theres still so many BluRays Ive never even watched once because I never really find myself saying now Im gonna sit down on the couch for  hours and watch this on my PS. I sit in front of the computer a lot but during that time not always am I totally occupied with what Im doing. With my dualmonitor setup its very much possible to watch a movie on the side however blasphemous this may sound to a cinephile.So I started pulling the stuff off the discs. Conversion to H. takes about a day for a p movie with a Core i and about as long as the movie takes so talking about realtime conversion when pulling off of a DVD. What this results in is a GB p source being compressed to about GB with virtually no loss in visual quality. For DVDs the end result is about GB in size. Again no loss in quality that you will be able to see at normal viewing distance.I personally use Plex as my media center which then enables me to watch my own stuff which I have physical copies of on any plexcapable device like smartphones TVs or really anything that can run a webbrowser. So very much like Netflix except I dont have to be afraid that my favorite movie might be gone a few months down the road. Plex in particular is very good at feeding metadata into the experience so you can browse your stuff with covers of the movies and TV shows and all kinds of bells and whistles like you would get them on Netflix. So I think if youre willing to make the effort you really can bring stuff that you personally own into the st century which to me means having the best of both worlds and I definitely dont regret taking that step.P.S. I like your blogpost of course.,misc,d4z8jmo,2,t5_2qjbr

Well his tax plan would be a massive cut to our current budget the wall would cost billions to build and maintain and even if patrolled wont keep out illegal immigrants who mostly come here legally and then overstay their visas and his tariffs would have a major negative impact on american businesses so thats three major policies which are poorly backed and dont make sense.Im more than happy to reconsider trump but all youve really got in this argument are your feelings and quite frankly the feelings of someone who calls his fellow americans traitors for believing that a politician is doing a good job arent worth much to me.gtThey are leeching off the economy and not really contributing back at all.What about the work they do over the course of their jobs which contributes to their employers well being?  What about the sales and income tax which is automatically deducted from purchases and paychecks?  What about the purchases they make while theyre here?gtIllegals are circumventing this by lying out their ass or by applying for welfare in shitholes like California.Which welfare programs in california allow payments without papers?gtTrump would not let Russia walk over us. gtObama is a fucking traitor and is not worthy of the presidencygtPeople that are loyal to Obama are not loyal to this countrys integrity.This is what Im talking about when I say voting with feelings instead of the facts.
