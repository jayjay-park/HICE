Old times but i am glad Biman on buying ER and also Thankfully Turkish started making trips to Dhaka ,bangladesh,cui0lc0,1,t5_2qixf
5698726,0,t3_3rnp1f,The following can be divided into two categories avoid and do not engage.     Do not travel alone.     Travel with people you trust.       Travel in populated areas.        Do not go sight seeing to distant places or places with few people.     Stick to shopping malls and hotels and your work place.      Do not mention religion or terrorism. If asked for opinion on religion say Islam is a very nice religion nothing else. If asked move away from that placepersons.     Be cautious when dealing with women. They or anyone can make a big deal out of it if they want to wring up an excuse to harm you.    Try to walk in streets as little as possible. Do not try to explore.    You will be targeted by pen handlers beggars taxi drivers.. pretty much anyone who think they can get money from a foreigner. So do not show your wallet and hide in an inner pocket if you can.      Rickshaws are awful. CNGs are awful. Taxis are okay but pricey comparatively. Street foods are awful. Do not drive.       All in all. As a foreigner you will be targetedfor different reasons moneyetc a lot more especially if you are white and smile at strangers.    ,bangladesh,cx3hd2x,2,t5_2qixf

6506382,0,t3_44r9jn,yes they do have different classes  you have first class that is usually air conditioned leather seats. you can also get a barth if you pay higher prices. you can also get nonAC first class. then you have second class less comfort and then third class straight up wooden chairs and definitely have more people than necessary some people get on to commute comparatively shorter distances. to get to Coxs bazar from sylhet youd have to pass through Dhaka and its going to be one long ride. think  hrs. The train from Sylhet to Dhaka is pretty good! However Id recommend a bus from Dhaka to Coxs bazar or a flight to Chittagong from SylhetDhaka and then ground transport to Coxs. The buses on the DhakaChittagongCoxs are really good and the level of comfort is way more than any US bus I have used so far well you dont get wifi but if you get a local provider esp GP then you have internet!. ,bangladesh,czsb4sr,3,t5_2qixf

10772028,0,t3_5u0w3g,gt A government agency on Sunday fined Grameenphone Tk . lakh for duping a customer with an offer.gt The complainant Sadiq will receive  percent of the fined amount in line with the law.. Not a bad deal for the complainant but certainly not a fair one for rest of the the GP internet subscribers. To accumulate  GP had to charge about  subscribers same amount as the compainant. But GP certainly didnt do that right?Grameen has . million subscribers. Among which . million are internet users. Assuming  accepted the offer Grameenphone made  or . million over  crore just from that additional amount .. And paid back was fined k. That is about . of what GP took from the people.,bangladesh,ddr20mp,2,t5_2qixf
