7740767,0,t3_4jsljg,I want to preface my comment here with thisI absolutely love how both Were Alive stories are produced. The sounds the actors the intensity...is bloody brilliant. Ear prn actually.But regarding Lockdown Ive had a hard time with it. I dont like any of the characters so I cant sympathize with them or root for them. The guards are just doing their job but I cant get to know them enough to like them. The inmates well...theyre not really likable characters cuz they all act like whiners. Steven Weber is freaking awesome as Jeremy though. I like to dislike him. My opinion is there were too many characters in this one and I had a hard time keeping up with who was who. A couple of the male actors had similar voices so Id mix them up constantly. There was too much casual dialogue shootin the shite and not enough action. If youre reading this Kc please forgive. I say this all with creative respect. Its only MY opinion and I dont speak for everybody. Of what I see most people dig it. Kc is so good at making these audio dramas though. He could make one about growing grass and Id still listen.For the record I will listen again.,Werealive,d3m2i0b,2,t5_2scs7
