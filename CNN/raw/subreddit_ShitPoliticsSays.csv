I am personally prochoice and think the government should stay the fuck out of these things. However people that are prolife genuinely believe that they are protecting a human being.The idea that they wont vote for prolife candidates also appears to be false.  of women classify themselves as prolife  In fact most polls seem to show that women are more likely to be prolife than men.Also if these idiot progressives actually read a history book they would have found out that the first abortion laws were created by the first wave of feminists like Susan B.

3162980,0,t3_2wby5n,I always like to remind people that Obamacare is essentially the GOP plan proposed in the s as the alternative to Clintons universal health care. When Clinton pushed for socialized medicine for all the GOP countered with an insurance mandate. Obama floated their own plan knowing real universal healthcare wouldnt have a chance not realizing the GOP hates him so much he cant even give them exactly what they want.Also important to note that Romney called the individual mandate the ultimate conservatismWhen they show up at the hospital they get care they get free care paid for by you and me. If thats not a form of socialism I dont know what is. So my plan did something quite different. It said you know what if people can afford to buy insurance if they can afford to buy insurance or if they can pay their own way then they either buy that insurance or pay their own way but they no longer look to government to hand out free care. And that in my opinion is ultimate conservatism. Thats why the Heritage Foundation worked with us and was at the celebration of the signing. The Heritage Foundation as you know a quintessentially conservative group recognized that the principles of free enterprise and personal responsibility were at work. And Im proud to talk about what we did. We did not need to raise taxes. We did not need to have the government take over health care. Instead we rely on private market dynamics to get people in our state insured and for individuals to finally take responsibility for some portion of their health care rather than expecting government to give them a free ride.,ShitPoliticsSays,copuatn,-9,t5_2vcl0

Yet when profits go up the workers generally dont reap the rewards.

So if you wereto call someone a man but they were in fact nonbinary you would have misgendered them.You can cut down on misgendering people by trying to not practice gender attribution and byasking people their preferred pronouns and terms when appropriate. Mtfmfmale to female A term usually synonymous with trans woman but also occasionallyused by other MAAB trans people. This term is problematic to some MAAB trans people asthey feel they were never male and because X to Y terms can put too much focus on traditionalmeans of physical transition. Neutrois This is an identity generally having to do with feeling one does not have a gender agender identity or a defined gender. Some people who identify as neutrois also identify asagender or genderless and some neutrois people desire to minimize their physical gendermarkers and to have a more genderneutral appearance. Nonbinary Nonbinary people are those who identify as a gender that is neither man norwoman or who are not men or women exclusively.

Passing When used by trans people it can either mean that one is being read as the genderthey identify as or that one is being read as cisgender. For example a trans man who peopleread as a man most likely a cis man. Preferred pronouns The pronouns one prefers to be called whether they be he she they itze ey or any other. It is preferable to always ask someone their preferred pronouns if possibleand to not make assumptions about a persons pronouns. Always be sure to respect a personspreferred pronouns use them and apologize if you slip up.

Preop preoperative means the person plans to orwants to have some form of genderrelated surgery but has not yet postop means they alreadyhave had some form of genderrelated surgery and nonop refers to trans people who do notdesire any genderrelated surgeries.

We observe speciation we observe the splitting of a population into multiple populations that cant interbreed. Once that happens there is nothing to prevent further divergence. We observe fine grained fossil sequences of significant evolution over long periods of time. gtYes Modern Hebrew.And none of the ancient commentators saw it as ages it was days. The modern Fundamentalist movement tries for a different meaning so they can fit their views into the science. But again the sequence is wrong no matter how you try to redefine Yom.

5043013,1,t1_cutidm8,She is ignoring the new testament not the old.gtIf this were the case the Nazis did nothing that would be reprehensible to religious people right? After all its just people following the rule of law right?There were religious groups that meekly refused to cooperate with the Nazis as there were conflicts with their view of Christianity. A group called  International Bible Students ended up in the concentration camps.  Most mainstream religions went for fullfledged support of the Nazi regime which could also be considered correct according to the bible.  Thus the famous pictures of catholic bigwigs giving the Nazi salute.  God apparently approved of both approaches because both groups are still around and possess fabulous wealth even today.  Im not saying the biblical approach is correct either way but nowhere in the new testament does it give you leave to actively resist authority which is what she did by instructing her clerks to disobey the government.I say she is ignorant because she stubbornly insists on pushing her interpretation of Christianity based on hatred of homosexuality as approved by the old testament.  Yet she ignores the instruction of the new testament which is the basis for all Christianity by ignoring the explicit instruction found in Romans.  She is in jail not because of a principled stand but because she is either a moron or a hypocrite.I suppose the story of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego could serve as an example but they werent allowed a choice.  They either had to break Gods law or be thrown in the furnace.  This lady had multiple options and she chose the worst one.Religion doesnt need to interfere with public service jobs.  Muslims cant serve alcohol Christians cant allow equal rights to homosexuals Jews cant serve bacon burgers whatever.  Get a different job that doesnt interfere with your heavenly reward!

All that extra mobility. Living in a mansion would be better for everyone.. I know it is ridiculous but it is the same rationale that you are using isnt it? It is an arbitrary line. Furthermore I think I can make a pretty darn good argument that even those arent good for society at all. I can make those arguments too and have in the past.  Most everyone agrees we should collectively contribute to a military because it is for all of our benefits.  If you want contributions for other things there needs to be a debate.  Thats all Im saying there are some things we should give people because it is cost effective.gtgtA lot of people wont give their fair share to these Democratically deemed acceptable causes so we forceably tax them.gt  Again fair share as defined by those that live off of that share? No democratically.  Thats everyone not just one demographic.gt  You mean like those millionaires and billionaires that went to the white house to promote that increased taxes on the rich? Yet after letting them explain why this is needed how unfair it is and how they wished to give more and then were shown the donation page where they could do just that they all ran like a virgin from a frat house.Where did I mention millionaires?  This doesnt seem relevant.gt Also they dont want it proportionally as is evidenced when you point out that the rich already pay for the majority of this country like  of itProportionally to their excess means.  You have more left over you should contribute more.They already do but that doesnt mean they shouldnt give more.gtso and with respect when you and others use the phrase fair share I sure as heck have no idea what you are referring to other than they should pay more so we dont  again that is parasitism. Fair share as defined by the majority.  If you think you can get policing transportation medicine for the kid next door whose parents are fuck ups and other services for the same price as you are paying in taxes now by all means show me how.gtWant further evidence? A defining characteristic of parasites is that they can only live as long as the host does. If all the rich people left this country is bankrupt  can they survive? According to them. nope. which is why the rich have to be bleed dry. I feel like I am beating a dead horse here but not all people who support these policies would die.  Many would be just fine!  Now I will mention a billionaire Warren Buffett.  He wants us to increase taxes on the wealthy and likes Sanders.  He is not a parasite.  He does donate a large portion of his wealth so your previous denouncing of the wealthy being scared virgins doesnt include him.That alone proves your overgeneralizations falseAgain Im no fan of Buffett or any Sanders policy supporters.

Anything in this modern political environment operates under the assumption that ultimately it will do good for the soceity as a whole and some regulations are indeed necessary for that.One example right on top of my head is the drug prices in India and US. The US system allows evergreening of patents and this prevents generics from being manufactured even after the original  years of patent period runs out. But India regulates that and prohibits the vile in my opinion practise of evergreening so the pharma companies are allowed to hold patents only for  years and then its available to be made a generic so that it benefits the vast majority which cant afford the original drug.

5951485,0,t1_cxzkfvb,The legitimate elections are kind of a sham at least on a national level. It seems that local elections bear generally constituent based candidates. Ill admit that. But the federal level candidates are preselected. There are two elections that occur the first and most important is the money election. Where candidates court monied interests for campaign and pac contributions. This is the most important election because it determines who we can vote for in that the only candidates who have a voice are the candidates with money. We cant hear the candidates who dont have any money. Again there are outliers but they represent an insignificant number of elected reps. The candidates we eventually vote for in the general elections are vetted and owned. Bought by the people who give them the voice to have a realistic chance at election in the first place. The measure of our government isnt that we hold free elections. We do have those. But that those elections bear the will of the people. In this matter our elections simply do not. Again I cite the damning Princeton study I cite it often because their methodology was sound and the data and conclusions withstand scrutiny well. Since  our government simply does not respond to public opinion about ANYTHING. This is what is so important. Its not that most of the time lawmakers ignore the will of their constituents in place of the will of the . Its that they literally NEVER listen to the . Laws which benefit the bottom if they pass pass with the support of the . Laws that do not have the support of the  simply NEVER pass.This is the hallmark of an oligarchy. Nothing happens without the expressed consent of the monied elite. The methodology used in the analysis Ive seen regarding the presence of a permanent landed aristocracy are simply not relevant to now. Basically theyre looking at the last  years for which there was a significant estate tax in place and claiming that the monied folks today are mostly self made. Their numbers are often spurious as well. They claim that a person who gets  million in an inheritance and turns it into  million is self made. That generational wealth does not survive passed  generations in a state of estate taxation is kind of the point. Remove the tax and you create the thing estate taxes were implemented to prevent. The point I was hinting at was the elimination of estate taxes creates a landed aristocracy. Generational wealth is one of the most powerful tools on the planet. Because it can utilize the most powerful financial force in the universe for longer periods of time. Compound interest. Consider if the rockafeller fortune was not taxed and was allowed to remain intact to today. The guy was shockingly rich. If allowed to grow at  indexed at  below market performance to account for some mismanagement it would be worth well over a trillion dollars. Yeah that is a t. If allowed to grow at a rate equal to the market it would be worth just under  trillion dollars. Lastly if allowed to grow at s rate it grew while under the direction of jay himself it would be worth over  trillion dollars. This is enough to own every single business listed on all publicly traded markets listed in the United States. Nasdaq Dow otcbb ect.

Remember this.gtAh so if you start poor you are more likely to end up poor than someone who didnt.... thats news?To people like you it sure seems that way. Sad isnt it?gtSo the poorest of the poor ARE economically mobile I see. If the lowest  can move up why cant anyone else? Everyone else has it easier than the bottom .See guys!? Dirtpoor can be just plain poor instead! BOOOOOOOOOTSRAPZZZZZZ!gtSo the article doesnt exactly conclude how hard or easy it is to move up but simply says you have a higher likelihood of being poor if you start poor. Uh....no shit?Considering your entire thesis is dur hur hur poor is easy to not be and you keep saying that youre not surprised that poor people stay poor... I mean am I missing something? Is there some sort of methedup Kansas bullshit lingo that Im missing here? Because it sounds like youre not making a lick of sense.gtNow heres something  of people who didnt finish high school live in poverty. !! Literally graduating high school decreases your chances of staying poor exponentially.Ignoring that you clearly dont know what the word exponentially means this does not mean what you think it means.  of people who didnt finish high school living in poverty sounds like a lot... except when you compare it to the  of people who are in poverty and did. Christ kid did you just figure that I wasnt going to read your link?gtIn   of families with single parents were poor. These whopping two factors are heavily involved in the poor community. If both of these are not true for you then odds are you will increase your class status.Im guessing that they dont teach advanced math in the flyover area youre from but you cant add those statistics together and then say See!?  of it is now covered!!! Or and this is whats confusing...  of families with single parents are below the poverty line... yet  of single parents have a high school degree. So clearly your cohorts arent matching up.When your argument is literally all it takes is education and not having sex ignoring your hard work remark since you clearly decided it was so unproveable that you couldnt halfass a google search like you did with the others you really need to be able to show that. And yet of the factors you mentioned neither account for even half of the factors involved. Hell given the  stat it hardly sounds like those factors have a relationship to one another.So maybe just maaaaaaaybe youre wrong and you should feel bad about sneering at poor people as lazy uneducated horndogs.

7426609,0,t1_d2mbozh,gt First of all my understanding is that most of the efforts to ban assault weapons have failed. But sure there have been some successful efforts.gt gt Something like  of the general public by the way is in favor of stricter gun enforcement  like stricter background checks for example.Stricter background checks are an entirely different discussion. The problem is that stricter background checks always get piggybacked on abhorrent bans and then fail. See for example the last one that failed federally.gt Finally you and I arent going to agree on gun enforcement anyway so Ill let the political process decide if enough people agree with you that we shouldnt be putting any new regulations on guns.Ok but its important to have FACTS straight when talking about what is being banned and not use terms incorrectly and be scared into thinking the wrong things.gt So I wouldnt so much call you crazy people imaging conspiracies but I would suggest that A the gun laws that could go through with a Hillary presidency are unlikely to affect you much Wrong. I enjoy my ARmalites and AWBs would ban them for no reason other than they look scary more on that below.gt and B Ill never understand why civilians think they need assault weapons.Ok. The problem here is as always the term assault weapon. Assault rifle is a term that has a definitive meaning. It means a weapon that fires an intermediate round that can receive a detachable magazine and capable of selective fire.  What is selective fire? That is basically a gun that has modes typically fullauto burstfire and semiauto. These guns have been banned multiple times and are not what AWBs are about. The term assault weapon is a purposely misleading term that has no fixed definition. It is purposely close to assault rifle Assault Weapon Bans universally target look alikes. That is they ban weapons based on aesthetic features not how they operate. Im not exaggerating when I say they are bans on guns that look scary. I remember specific Congresmen saying that guns that look menacing should be banned. Anyway what do they ban? They classify an assault weapon as a gun that can receive a detachable magazine and has a vertical foregrip or has a pistol grip or has a muzzle shroud or bayonet lug. Basically literally nothing about the FUNCTIOn of the gun just features of it that they think are scary. These guns are largely never used in gun crimes pistols generally are. I could show you a couple of Fudd hunting guns that wouldnt be considered assault weapons that are far more deadly. In fact heres a video from the s that shows it well So those are the weapon ban portions of AWBs the other issue is mag limits which Ill cover below. Spoiler alert it takes no time at all to change magazines.gt gt I mean hunting is hardly a sport if youre using a high capacity gun to kill the animals. And so beyond that all I can imagine is that you just believe you should have access to all guns. But its obviously if you think about the issue for more than  seconds that this is impossible. I mean we could interpret the nd amendment as your right to bear nuclear weapons or massive bombs or bazookas or machine guns.This is a strawman and you know it. No one is arguing for nuclear weapons or ordinance of any kind. As I have covered above assault weapons bans are not about machine guns. Also its really no business of yours how many rounds I use when I hunt. Again an AR is not a assault rifle its not a machine gun its in fact just a well built rifle that is popular because its highly customizable and light. Theyre not mowing down a deer like Rambo.gt Maybe you think you should be able to own some of these things but I would imagine that you might even be against your fellow citizens owning some of these things. Once you agree that there is some line where your right to own weapons stops thats where we have to have policy debates about exactly where that line should be.The problem again is the absolute refusal of people who want restrictions to actually understand the things they want to ban. Its hard to have an honest and frank discussion with someone who doesnt even know the difference between a semiautomatic and a machine gun. Or doesnt even know what AWBs are proposing to ban. gt gt Finally Im not sure its true that bans on semiautomatic guns are simply just bans on guns that look scary. I think the logic is as followsgt They cant stop gun deaths but what they really are trying to prevent is MASS SHOOTINGS. Mass shootings are I think youd agree easier to commit with high capacity guns.gt First why are mass shootings the concern? Because law enforcement understands that if a person is trying to kill one person they will be able to do that pretty easily regardless of any gun laws.gt However more innocent bystander types are killed in mass shootings people killed when the gunman just starts firing indiscriminately. And so law enforcement believes they can reduce the number of innocent bystanders killed by guys who go nuts and decide they want to kill as many people as possible. Then we should be sure people who have the propensity for such things get mental health care they need. gt I think the logic then is that if a guy has  bullets in a gun he has to stop to reload after shooting  shots. That leaves a sooner opening in time for someone to intervene tackle him etc... But if hes got  shots he can pretty much kill everyone around him or cause them all to flee then hes got more time to reload and just keep firing.gt If more people have easy access to guns with larger clips a guy can do more damage once he decides to just start shooting.It takes precisely three seconds to change a magazine.  Also the average amount of rounds fired in a gun crime is  rounds. So do we logically limit to three rounds then? Perhaps more exactly Cho killed all those people at VaTech with just some pistols and a backback full of mags. Besides that the slipperyslope argument has been proven valid here as states that have imposed some limits in the past have gradually moved them lower and lower. There is valid reason for gun owners to assume its eventually about no magazines at all especially when some states require you to have a fixed mag if you want your rifle to be comfortable to fire at all.,ShitPoliticsSays,d2mcvwc,1,t5_2vcl0

Being a single parent is a killing blow to your household income and makes you much more likely to end up in the lower class. Stay in school.

Stop committing crimes. Blacks make up  of the population yet are responsible for  of overall crime and an astonishing  of violent crime This is something that is insanely easy to do. All it takes to not end up in prison is willpower. And before anyone tries to say anything about longer sentencing a  survey found blacks were actually under prosecuted.

State reps chose the Senate and the EC chose the President.We have gotten away from people being involved at the state level and concentrated that at the federal level.  People are upset with Congress inaction so then they want a benevolent dictator in the President.  Back to the original point the EC is the states not the people choosing the representative.  That choice is weighted by the will of the people.  Just because CA happened to draw the luck of being a territory rather than RI being a colony does not mean the state is more important.

If the general public doesnt own the business then how is that different from a group of people owning the means of production? I mean theres only  of usbut we still own our own means of production dont we?Would we all get paid equally? Say the monthly profit is  would Sean get the same as Bill even if Bill only produced  worth of goods while Sean produced ?I know theres no boss to decide this for us since we all own it equally so would it come down to majority vote? What if because of his business prowess we voted to pay James  of the companies yearly profits in exchamge for him managing the business? Would that be allowed? Would James have to forego the payment and manage the business for the same wage as the rest of us? Would managing a business even be allowed?What if there are  of us and we all own an equal share in the means of production assuming that it doesnt just belong to everyone in the general public now say we fall on hard times and we have to let some people go in order to keep making enough money for both the business to run and for us to feed our families. How would we go about choosing who to let go? Would we be allowed to let people go? What if they dont want to go? Could we force them? If we couldnt then isnt it essentially possible for a small number of people to destroy a large business?

11036204,0,t1_deitpmk,Let me ask you a question and I want you to answer honestly.  If the allegations in the Steele dossier are true and the FBI has evidence that the Trump campaign worked with the Russians during the election will you continue to support Trump?  I will tell you this I hate his orange ass but if after an investigation if nothing is turned up that shows that he colluded with foreign agents to influence the election I will give him a chance.  The fear for a lot of people is that there all these really really bad allegations swirling around and there has not been any public release of information.  There is just smoke and smoke and smoke and smoke but no fire.  I am worried because if even if there is say only a  chance that the allegations against Trump are true the magnitude of such a chance is so great that it should in my view make everyone a little uneasy.Elections have consequences and if a Republican wins than thats just the way the cookie crumbles and is a good thing because I think Conservatives deserve just as much a voice in government as anyone else and if they win they should be able to carry out their agenda.  What is unacceptable to me however is if anyone worked with foreign agents to undermine American democracy and if you and I cant agree on that then we got even bigger problems.,ShitPoliticsSays,deixn6l,-11,t5_2vcl0

11163306,0,t1_dex76xv,I see youre still having trouble processing the main point of the comment I shared no problem. My view is reflected in the bolded section of that comment which is why I chose to share it because what were saying is DO NOT ...just label people and if they dont agree with you you scream the labels louder and louder.You want to support Trump and the GOP and protest the KKK? Awesome standing up against organized racism should definitely be encouraged and not shamed even if not all core values are shared. Trying to move our society past racism is common ground that I would hope people of this country can share regardless of their politics. And thats where we get stuck. When it starts to become clear that racism informs the opinions and political goals of ranking members of our government you cant blame people for wanting to make that a national dialogue. Kings tweet is a perfect example the actions of our current attorney general are another. Racism is still a huge issue in America and when I said that in this country we have consistent undiluted racism that we have not repaired Im really struggling to understand how that inspires you to respond by sayinggt Fuck you for being a complete ignorant idiot.Did this conversation not start because of a discussion over protesting a KKK march? In ? Is there still not a vast undercurrent of passive racism that informs the social attitudes and opinions of everyone who proudly flies a Confederate flag in honor of their heritage? Great strides have been made legislatively and socially to help move the needle on equality in this country but diehard racism is still going as strong as ever or we wouldnt be having this discussion in the first place.Now as far as gt Kings tweet had to do with Muslims in Europe.That was the CONTEXT of it.OK fair enough. So do you agree with him or no? Because when you saygt Europe is dealing with a problem right now. An aspect of their culture is failing to assimilate and that failure is being blamed on Europeans themselves.gt Too many of their Muslim migrants are choosing to selfsegregate in enclaves and refusing to accept that they live in more liberal nations now.It sounds like you might be trying to justify that view. Now Im not sure how a slower assimilation can be blamed on Europeans themselves outside of overtly xenophobic actions potentially taken against immigrants because of preconceived notions held by citizens of the host country but OK.I mean you take a group of people who grew up understanding one version of society and now find themselves in something completely different and people think its weird theyre clinging to each other and forming communities around whats familiar?Im pretty sure thats the story of any migrant population the world over. How many cities in America have sections called Little Italy Chinatown or something similar because it was an area of concentrated immigrants once upon a time? The parents who come over will always have a hard time their kids will assimilate more easily though and their kids after that.gt Fuck you for being so dumb that you think a Sharia divorce court is an acceptable thing in a western first world nation.I never said that nor would I. What I was pointing out is that these are not civil courts that have actual legal authority. They are religious councils where Muslim UK citizens can voluntarily go to handle issues they think should be handled in a culturally traditional religious way. Why they would choose that I personally dont understand Separation of Church and State is the only way to go in my book. Im sure theres social pressure from the community a lack of understanding of how the law works in their new home a lack of education of basic civil rights as defined by the Western first world etc.    Im certainly not advocating Sharia Courts are the way to go even voluntarily but the way you phrased it made it seem as if Sharia Law were being forced on UK citizens who did not wish it and that is misrepresenting the context. Anyone who reads your comment without reading the article that you posted will likely take your comment ofgt In the UK Muslims are applying Sharia Law to UK citizens.gt Thats allowed.at face value with the implication that Muslim immigrants universally have trouble assimilating and therefore force their beliefs on others in some kind of cultural hostile takeover thus justifying any bigotry directed at the Muslim community as a whole.Objectively you dont have to be a white supremacist to advocate for bigotry. Just like you dont have to be a bleedingheart liberal to stand against it. gt Just fuck you.Ive noticed this was the thesis of your whole reply and to your credit it was a very salient point.

Also the government should be paying for all of it.Besides you Rethuglikkkans SAY you care about the life of a sixteenyearold but then you just dont care about their life when they turn .

Since then the definition of Nazi has changed to mean anybody who says or does anything the left disapproves of.

You cant spend all this time calling Trump a Nazi and evangelicals Nazis and Republicans Nazis and people who eat meat Nazis and people who dont like immigration Nazis and people who think there are only two genders Nazis and then suddenly pretend the word has anything to do with World War II when you start advocating violence against them.
