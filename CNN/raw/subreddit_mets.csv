I say this with the utmost respect but watching the Mets I feel the same underdog spark and camaraderie of the Giants in the Mets.  Wish you all the best in the World Series.  PS Thanks for taking out the Dodgers!!!,mets,cw8hnva,19,t5_2qj2q

David Wright played there for a bit and I remember as a kid I met him a few times and it was HUGE for me when he went into the major leagues when i was  or  for whatever reason. Hes been my favorite ever since.,mets,d3fpt03,6,t5_2qj2q
