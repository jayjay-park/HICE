300620,0,t1_cfbv4hc,This kind of advertising has always made me cringe. It is in a similar vein as the Axe body spray advertising model that theyve used for years. Become a manget the ladies. The implication is what I find so absolutely insane and that is that by using this soap spray or hair product youll be the ultimate ladies man. Im not suggesting that hygiene and style arent of very high importance in regards to attracting others. They obviously are. There are just a million almost identical ways to take care of yourself. As far as smellcome to manhood goes Im at a loss. Use this soap and become a man? You got it Old Spice.,Com320_ASU_Spring2014,cfbxbc5,1,t5_2zo5p
304405,0,t1_cfbzvus,i agree all car commercials try to create a way to make the viewer need a new car because its better faster and efficiency and that how exactly what audi try to show in their commercials  but personally i think a car is a false need when comparing  it to other real needs  like water and food and even clothing may be much important than buying a new car for not well justified reasons  ,Com320_ASU_Spring2014,cfcbhi5,1,t5_2zo5p
565441,0,t1_cg4f9zc,Totally agree. Same thing happens when new video games come out. People literally camp outside the store to be the first ones to get it. The superhuman qualities control the people. Anything new that comes from these popular brands people go crazy over and will jump through hoops to get. Also I agree with you when talked about the exclusive colors. When iPhones came out with the colored iPhones I knew people who bought them just because it was colored and new. The colored iPhones were the same model as theirs just a different color. Apple was reselling the same phone that was already out same features just a different back cover and people are still going crazy for them. ,Com320_ASU_Spring2014,cg4jocz,1,t5_2zo5p
