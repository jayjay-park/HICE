11081164,0,t1_denoqfe,I have an idea. What if. You uploaded the videos to youtube with a new gmail account but make them all privateunlisted. Then setup a websiteblog and embed the videos. Fans can see the videos on your site which you can put put ads on. Do NOT monetize with youtube ads at all. Just banner ads on the site.,FunnyJapan,deo1g83,16,t5_3icp5
