1706609,0,t3_2dw9e8,Keep in mind that the two places recommended so far are on the eastern side of town.. Not the best area.. Country Club West is around  for a two bedroom which is high but out on the western part of town.. Only downside is the electric utilities which can be a little high sometimes. ,Greeley,cjua3e8,2,t5_2s93r
2166016,0,t3_2jrddz,If it was that late at night I wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt a flare stack.  Living out near Galeton I know theyre bright as hell when its dark out I admit I actually called the sheriffs office once because I happened to see them light one at about  p.m. looked like an explosion and it freaked me out..  In other words I hadnt heard anything about an actual fire.,Greeley,clf5fzs,2,t5_2s93r

11683334,0,t3_66nfom,Hey! Local photographer here. Is there any ideas that anyone has for new photos for this? Or maybe a scrolling photo banner? The only example I know of is from rnaruto... whoopsGreeley has grown a lot in the last couple years and looks to be growing even more within the next few years potential outlet mall more and more restaurants and stores moving to GreeleySo I think we should represent that growth in the new photosthemes this subreddit becomes. To fully represent what Greeley IS not what it WAS you know?,Greeley,dgkbn0c,4,t5_2s93r
