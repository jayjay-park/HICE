5742655,0,t3_3toer7,Dear boleaganja your idea was good the raft idea but i did some studies about games and if a player wants to build a raft he wants something simpleFor example i want to make a house and its made of out of wood you must make it simple and logic yours is simple and logic but not many ppl know the diffrence still good idea but what i want to see is more structures by humans like a bank and you can plunder it with your companions and if you make a raftboat and go to a island i get insta killed lvl  dia armour still  hit kills me,randomadventurerogue,cx8xk5h,1,t5_39t49
