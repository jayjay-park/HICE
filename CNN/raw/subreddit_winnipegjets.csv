152285,0,t3_1vtxdy,Ducks fan here. A couple things to say.One awesome game for your goalie. Id like to say it wasnt Hillers night but that has nothing to do with how well Pavlec did. Two that was a ton of blocked shots. I know it isnt the easiest thing in the world to do over and over but when you pull off a win like this its certainly worth it and extremely satisfying.Great game by your goaltending and defense and I good luck to you guys on Thursday. I hope you keep that streak going.Also I missed the end of the game I work nights and had to go. What the hell did Perry do? I hope it wasnt something too stupid.

1236259,0,t3_288mwu,Honestly If we were going to look at a trade Id say were looking for an upgraded center a certified C that would probably send B Little in a package with some lower playerspicksprospects.Trading away our best D man who might I add is only  for a center probably wouldnt work. We have Little who is a perfect C and we have Scheifele who could be a C but will likely be C material for a few years. Bring in another guy who is C and we have trouble with paying our C . million is less than ideal weve already gone that route with Jokinen.We have good centermen but are just missing that star that other teams have a la Giroux.Realistically the only way I see Trouba in talks is for a Goalie.Also as you said youve got a surplus of Centers we dont really have a surplus of Defense Enstrom is good BOGO is injury prone and inconsistent Stuart is a badass but of no threat to score Pardy and Ellerby are decent but dont hold much value. You can see where this is going.Now Hypothetically.If we didnt have team considerations in mind.Couturier has been a hot topic in WPG because he was picked after our boy Scheifele and thats basically how everyone evaluated that pick up until this year.I think that his value is lower than Troubas but not by a whole lot. Keep in mind I dont know a whole lot about CouturierReasons Trouba is younger only  year not a major differenceTrouba has made a flawless transition into the NHL and save for a few minor rookie hiccups was great in very nearly every game he played in. You noted inconsistencies in Couturiers gameHes proved that he can play our important minutes and play them well. C probably isnt a position where hes seen as many of those big minutes as a top paired D manBased on value alone and not team needsmarket forces I would say that Couturier  a higherrisk prospect or a ndrd round pick.Its a tough thing to value though because its future face of Philly vs. Future face of Winnipeg. I think with guys like these its probably best for management to trust your scouting and development strategies than get burned by trading them away. If the player doesnt develop into what everyone had hoped its usually on the players shoulders unless there was mismanagement  A. Burmistrov comes to mind. If however they trade away what they had and that person becomes a star even if both guys become stars you know what they say about missing things once theyre gone.,winnipegjets,ci8p1zy,5,t5_2ru32

2912794,0,t3_2thgjn,Im sure not everyone will agree but my personal opinion on the matter!Thinking longterm Enstroms contract is not ideal.  He is the highest paid jet and his contract lasts until he is  or ??? I believe its a .m AAV which lasts till somewhere around the  season ish.  My thoughts are that although he is undoubtedly a good defender the contract sucks for  reasons...   I dont think he is anywhere near our best player so why I question why he is paid like it not to mention this could drive up the price of our other defenders ex Big Buff!.    Most players tend to fizzle our around their mid s ex Danny Heatley.  Yes I am quite aware Jagr is  and is still a big ole beauty but he would be considered an exception.In short the idea here would be to sell Enstrom while he is still a good player and has trade value and get something good in return.  EX Taylor Hall for Toby Enstrom.  yes I realize that is probably an unrealistic trade but you get the point.OTHER OPTIONSOur depth defenders might be of worth to some teams Edmonton?.  These players being Adam Pardy Paul Postma Grant Clitsome with his million dollar contract which is very large considering I question if he makes the first team next year  although he technically cant be traded.Pavelec is someone who I would trade at the draft because of his contract roughly M AAV and the emergence of Clutchinson and the amazing Hellebuyck as I consider Paves to play a vital role in a possible playoff run a possible mentor and a guy who takes the pressure off of Clutchinson.replacing Halischuck on the rd line like uimfromwinnipeg has said is definately a good idea although I would argue he is a hard working player he just doesnt seem to have much offensive upside.THE PLAYERS TO LOOK FORrd line winger to replace halischuckrd line center that whos a good faceoff guy which would put Lowry in Halischucks spot or if you get a center and a wing put Lowry into Slaters spotOf course any player of greater value would be great I just wouldnt know where to put him lolThoughts and criticism is certainly welcome I do put some time into my posts and appreciate feedback DEdit Formatting,winnipegjets,cnz6xtj,4,t5_2ru32

3461846,0,t3_2zvdjf,This is an interesting question. My answer would be dependent on my goal do I want the best chances of winning the first round or do I want the best chances of making it to the conference finals.Ill address the latter first. I want Anaheim. Of the four I think they offer the least likely chance that we win but if we do then we are seeded in the Pacific and I really like our chances against Vancouver or Calgary in round . This would by no means guarantee a second round win but Id like our chances a lot more against those teams over any of the central teams.Now lets look at getting that first round winAnaheim I believe is our worst chance. They are physical deep and we have yet to beat them this year. The only hope against them is weak goaltending.St. Louis as a fan of hockey would be my favourite series. Both teams play a similar style and our battles with them have been very close. However we are  in our last  and they have a chip on their shoulder after last year. I really do not want St. Louis in the first round or any round for that matter.Chicago on the surface would be the most likely favourite. We seem to be the team they cant beat and we can do it in their building. They play mostly a skill game and I believe our success against them has been because we force them to play the physical game. That being said this is a team deep with talent and playoff experience as a unit not just individuals. Kane or no Kane this is a scary playoff team that is a perennial cup contender. nd or rd round yes. But not in the first.This leaves me with Nashville. A strong team and like the others we play them tight. That being said the only thing that concerns me about Nashville is Rinne. They are talented but lack playoff experience. So do we but we play playoff hockey and have been for awhile. I really like our chances against this team in the first round.Either way the playoffs are not a cake walk. I love the Jets and think they play the right game for the playoffs but any of the potentials that well play can oust us. Im really excited for this unit to have a taste of that. Ill be ecstatic if we can get past the first round. ,winnipegjets,cpmvj2r,2,t5_2ru32

Sometimes you get big subs like rhockey that grow organically to retain some semblance of intelligence and civility. But a lot of that is luck. We were lucky that the people that registered rhockey supported its growth and made good decisions. It could have gone the way of ratheism and collapsed under differences in opinions on how to run the place.

I would do it again .Besides there is nothing wrong with some friendly trash talk between teams. Winnipeg plays the Leafs our th game in. You will sit there and congratulatr the Leafs on a well played game and that is terrific. I applaud your sportsmanship. When Winnipeg beats the Leafs in October am I going to feel bad that we cleary took the better pick and that Laine is the better player? Not at all. Do I hope the Leafs find success? Hell yah!

Especially when considered hes being honored by a separate entity than what he was apart of in the past. True North has the right to scrutinize every aspect of this Hall of Fame its theirs and their image. They owe no one anything and that is the truth theyve earned everything they have. This is not about making some old people happy this about creating a monument to honors those who truly are great people not just hockey players.

8596662,0,t3_4wpwy4,I feel like venting.So Im going to vent.For the past  months Ive felt depressed. I bold felt because I never talked to a professional about it and only  or  actually know about my situation. I havent really had a reason to feel depressed the. only major things thats happened in my life in these past months is graduating High School and getting Platinum in League of Legends wooo. But Ive had periods of feeling empty inside wanting to do nothing but sleep and at the very worst points which has happened  times thinking of the least painful wayleast graphic way of leaving if you know what I mean. But dont fret Id never do such a thing. When Id think about that Id think of how my family would react. Id think how friends that Ive met in real life and that Ive met online shoutout to umadzerglin would react and it would absolutely repulse me from the idea. Basically my emotions and logic wouldnt agree but Im strong enough to let logic win thankfully. I took up smoking cigs again. Id only smoke at the lowest points so Ive only took  or  out of the pack I have hidden away and its been I think  weeks since my last one. Im not addicted or anything it just helps get my mind off of the abyss of nothingness Id feel. But recently Ive generally felt more happy. It started with talking to a good friend in Pakistan again after over half a year of hearing nothing from her and fearing the worst i always do emotions dont like logic again. Ive started asking my closest friends if theyd like to hang out more and actually following that up.So like I dont know why Im telling you guys of all people this. I mean no offense youre all great company during the season but Im not really close to any of you. I guess I just want to get it off my chest.This song basically sums up my experience of the whole thing. Most of it applies to how I feelfelt seriously though dont worry about me. ill be fine in the end. edit i also started making covers again so thats nice. ,winnipegjets,d6g6ae9,4,t5_2ru32

10054751,0,t3_5jkr3q,So what they lost!! Big deal! Jets fansFreaking out and overreacting!Fire the Coach Fire the Gm Trade all the players! etc. lol!Heres my assessment of the Jets after  games. They suffered major injuries to key players and had the worst schedule in November in the NHL. I would rather focus on individual players rather than team performance because so many players have been in and out. Now that players are returning and the crazy part of the schedule has passed I want to see what PoMo can do with this lineup. For me now his and his staffs evaluation starts and decisions should be made at the end of the year if this type of performance continues. I think the Jets have shown fans that the organization at the top is professional secure and has a plan. As far as depth the organization keeps showing that there is upcoming talent. Deep in goal I feel need a few more elite defensive prospects. And a few elite forwards not on the Jets. Connor Howden Roslevic Foley Spachek. If the play of these elite players doesnt improve then the coach is responsible.As far as the current rosterWe have a elite top line. Ehlers Scheifele LaineGood nd line with Little and Wheeler. PoMo needs to figure out who will join themGood rd line with Lowry Armia PerreaultDefence Core when Myers is healthy Morrissey pleasant suprise as a top  D  BuffEnstrom TroubaChairot Myers when healthyI think Hellebuyck will be a good goalie but isnt ready to handle being the  yet. Next year Chevy needs to make Hellebuyck the backup.   in  starts Helle has had  shutouts  goal games and  goal games.  However he has has had  games of  goals. Unfortunately Chevy probably needs to wait until after the expansion draft to make moves to the roster for fear of having more players exposed. I think we just need to watch the development of the players this season. To me Burmi Thorburn Stuart Pav have all played themselves off the team. Copp Lowry Morrissey Liane has made the team for long term planning. For me Im focused on Hellebuyck Petan Armia Dano Connor Tanev and Roslevics development this year.  To me this is a pivotal year for making good decisions to decide whos in and whos out going forward. Players and coaches. Chevy has put together the lineup.

My opinion of the subject matter that was linked since I am compelled to share Laine is he even half  yet? The guy is humble confident and his pass is as good as his shot. He has hockey IQ coming out of every glide and movement of his stick. He is a generational player.

10668914,0,t1_ddge0xt,Agree to disagree. When Chevy hired Pomo they both understood that this was a growth period. Yes not making the playoffs is extremely disappointing but the growth form most of our youth has been extraordinary. Even the hockey we are playing right now is do or die which is good experience for our youth. The Jets are a draft and develop organization and that includes our coaches. Clearly our assistants have been given time to develop but I think that time is coming to an end. Pomo will get a chance to hire his own crew and if that fails then we will move on. There are only  soon to be  coaches in the NHL. Even if Julien gets hired by someone else there will always be plenty of potential NHL coaches in the future.

But then he all of a sudden had surgery after skating with the team a few times. Was very suspect.Glad they actually came out and told us after the fact but this isnt something they needed to tell while it was happening.

I also wouldnt say he has a great contract. . million for a second pairing defenseman is about the going rate. Not a bad contract but nothing special in my mind.More importantly though the point isnt to trade him to be rid of him. Youd be wanting to get a LHD on a similar contract back in return. Myers is a good player but a LHD is more important for the team. ,winnipegjets,dg049sw,1,t5_2ru32

I picked Perreault mostly because his pretty big contract and that may cause some issues in the future. Also Connor can replace his spot on the top two lines next year and we keep our young core intact.
