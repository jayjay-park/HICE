7755660,0,t3_4liz81,Keep your head up. The girl that I love was married when I fell for her. I thought our relationship was doomed to never happen and now were coming up on our one year mark.Ive never been one to think in absolutes that things were or werent meant to be but it took my dad having a stroke me going through two abusive relationships a suicide attempt and moving halfway across the country for me to end up with her so you never know. If any one of those things in my life hadnt happened I wouldnt be where I am today.If you really feel strongly for her keep her in your life. You never know.,Feels,d3nrdpu,3,t5_2t8vh

I know its not alright to create excuses for yourself but it isnt really your fault. Just resolute and move on.,Feels,d5nrd99,3,t5_2t8vh
