EDIT Didnt realize that you are selling your pictures I would love to buy some wallpapers if you ever expand into that field,knightsofsidonia,csf16m2,2,t5_31ka7
4414717,0,t3_3bkzp9,huh think this was my thread. Yeah sounds like a good way to end the manga.,knightsofsidonia,csn9ukd,1,t5_31ka7
4471702,0,t3_3cabja,Knowing the sizes of flairs or banners could help a lot. If there is a guide for this or some templates someone could help. I am new to reddit started a few months ago so I dont know about styling subreddits.,knightsofsidonia,csubxsd,1,t5_31ka7
4473252,0,t1_csuc638,A DM would probably be the most appropriate course of action. It will get their attention and start a dialogue much more quickly.,knightsofsidonia,csuixnf,1,t5_31ka7

5760752,0,t1_cxaswch,Yeah I do agree that another chapter would have done the ending more justice. Lets hope for a Season  with more of a satisfying ending...,knightsofsidonia,cxb6b5w,2,t5_31ka7
6252160,0,t1_cv60wxe,Well we are missing  out of  of the Sidonia sight spots afterall and in the end its hinted that we should see more of Izana and Nagates child huh. Not sure I want to see anymore of this manga after the retarded ending though.,knightsofsidonia,cz0ax8r,1,t5_31ka7
6332111,0,t1_cz9ca16,Mayurichans voice actor is so cute indeed. If I remember correctly the great rollercoaster of emotions starts at  after ep   After that point I had to marathon the rest lol. Enjoy! First  episodes or so barely have progression or meaning at first but once you see every episode you SHOULD watch the first episode again and youll be like WOW Then there is the OVA and then the movie. Both are pretty awesome. They super recently released a new Episode  divide by zero or something like that but its just a replacement episode that goes into an alternate version of the story since it is based off of a Light Novel PC game with multiple storyline routes like FateZero or Fatestay night for ex. And the new anime series that will be based off that new episode  route isnt even aired yet so dont bother with it lol.,knightsofsidonia,cz9e3wc,1,t5_31ka7

7128608,0,t3_4d4md9,There isnt any news about a new series but at least we are getting a reprint of Blame! Also at the end of KoS there is a hint for a sequel but its still just a hint and nothing concrete.,knightsofsidonia,d1ofxhu,3,t5_31ka7
