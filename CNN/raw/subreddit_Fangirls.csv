3375700,0,t1_cpd1wo1,He was! I just didnt want it to sound like a grown man crying in a batman suit was a turnon of mine lol. But yeah I actually really love Bens character. Id tap that so hard when hes not crying...,Fangirls,cpd1zd5,3,t5_2vvqm
3425585,0,t1_cpipvuv,So we are gonna keep skincolour a big fucking deal forever? Ok It thought we would want people to be equal. I guess Im wrong in wanting equality. I dont see this as being the same as blackface at all. The original character is a black woman playing a black woman. The cosplayer is just someone who likes the character. Its not a mockery its not someone saying A black person couldnt play this character so we got a white person a black face instead. ITS LOVE FOR A CHARACTER AND SHE WANTED TO BE THAT GODAMNED AWESOME CHARACTER,Fangirls,cpiqpw0,1,t5_2vvqm
3906158,0,t3_3540vz,While I was looking around I found this collection that seems to cover a good number of the fandoms that I would guess are popular around here. And theyre already mostly done so maybe it would be easier for you? Im not familiar with all of these like Vampire AcademyTeen Wolf so I have no idea how accurate they are and the Walking Dead def looks weird. But its somewhere to start?Im sure the DWGoTXmen at least would be pretty popular. I am feeling indecisive this morning and cant pick one. ,Fangirls,cr1jbkl,3,t5_2vvqm
3934732,0,t3_35iusy,lol the most ridiculous thing about the fake fan thing is that Ive never met a group that is as anal retentive about details and information about their own chosen area of expertise as fans.so basically even if you are a fake fan if you wanna stay anywhere near the center of the attention in the fandom the youre gonna have to study the scriptures and become a real fan real quickand also the fact that there is no wrong way to like things but I mean I am one of those analretentiveaboutdetails and if I find this shit ridiculous Casual Caspers hating on fans for not being on their level should examine their life honestly.,Fangirls,cr4sm3t,3,t5_2vvqm

4491980,0,t3_3cevr3,Tons more Sengoku Basara  Sumeragi teaser stuff has been released in the past week. Man theyre really driving the hype up before the release at this point I dont think I can physically take more excitement before I explode and disintegrate into confetti and hotblooded yelling.Like there are literally so many things at this point in this game that I could yell about but Naotora in a wedding dress and goddamn Yoshiaki Mogami dumping the shogun to go cavort with the usurper Oda Nobunaga are probably my favourites. Thank you Capcom for validating my read that Mogami has great thirst at last.Also everyone in this game is in love with the shogun. I am fine with this. Im in love with the shogun. Its just all so terrible for my poor fangirl heart ,Fangirls,cswvhlf,3,t5_2vvqm

8539383,0,t3_4wlkoe,That is a pretty well balanced look at the state of play.I find it interesting reading about shipping as its only something I started doing in the past year.Im still not use to this idea of fans trying to have any say over the creative aspects of media beyond pointing out when something is problematic in of itself.I suppose with the availability of social media and the commercialisation of fiction since the rise of the novel that the current situation was inevitable. Though it would be good if both sides like the articles author suggests could take each other into account a little more.,Fangirls,d68znvd,3,t5_2vvqm
10742387,0,t1_ddnzozn,Thank you. I dont know why I let internet assholes get to me I know better than to engage them. I guess I just get tired of jerks online who think theyre superior because theyre the right kind of fan. ,Fangirls,ddnzv5a,3,t5_2vvqm
