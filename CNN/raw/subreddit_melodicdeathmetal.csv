But I just CANT come to grips with the cheesy cleans in their latest.  I expect the upcoming album to be pretty bad .  Ephemeral was epic but thats because it had minimal cleans and sounded like the old stuff.  I just dont know Nilo has THE BEST mdm growls in the industry but this campfire sing along shit isnt Insomnium and it sure isnt brutal.,melodicdeathmetal,cgb7r7s,2,t5_2sgqv

10372396,0,t3_5ogzw0,Melodic death is still a fairly popular subgenre. Bands like In Flames and Amon Amarth are super well known and have large followings. I think what you really asking about are the criticisms some people have or why some people dont like melodic death metal. The reasons why some people may not like itlook down on it are as follows. It is an entrylevel subgenre. A lot of people who get into metal start with melodeath myself included. More experienced listeners are either have been there and done that and moved on to other metal genres or they see as a little too accessiblepoppy and it draws in more causal fans  which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the circumstances.. This is my personal opinion but I think melodeath has strayed too far from its roots and has been watered down. Melodic death metal was originally supposed to be death metal but more melodic sounding. Really really early melodeath sounds like this. Then it turned into its own thing with the Gothenburgstyle stuff which is different but still good. Eventually modern melodeath arrived which has a lot of metalcore influence and which to me sounds like poppy radio rock. I just think that melodeath works better as a genre the closer it stays to its roots.,melodicdeathmetal,dcjruhr,3,t5_2sgqv
