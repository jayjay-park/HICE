1269433,0,t1_cicfaei,Your welcome! It is quite unfortunate to see things changed the way they did but it doesnt mean that things have to continue going in that direction because the Gathering is what people make it so if people get together and decide that if someone is causing physical or verbal abuse to others then that person should be dealt with accordingly or else Rainbow will further drive away those who made it what it was. The elders are getting older and are starting to die and they still are doing most of the work both infrastructure and councils so I still have a glimmer of hope that it can be shifted in the direction of positive progression. I encourage people to start their own regionalnodeseed gatherings in the Rainbow spirit all over the country and the world because psychologically speaking Dunbars Number tends to hold true and smaller gatherings all over can help quell such unfortunate circumstances that have been happening in recent years and embody the Rainbow philosophy that much more. ,rainbowgathering,cicfeud,1,t5_2qtsh

The isolated incidents like this story are easier to describe than the good which is more than just free food and camping and drum circles and oming. The thing about rainbow that is so amazing but cant be understood until you go is the vibe  the way the love and acceptance there makes you feel. How amazing it is to see so many different people working together peacefully.  And that is what makes this story so awful  that it seems so out of place.  If this happened down the street from me it would be tragic but not nearly as surprising.  People are killed everyday in cities.  But this is family. ,rainbowgathering,cpdvncu,1,t5_2qtsh

8208177,0,t3_4rk6zf,The road wasnt closed due to our lack of thought. The LEOs were blaming the rain as an excuse to hassle people. Blame them not peaceful gatherers  gatherers that also would be more interested in giving you stuff than stealing. And OMG! Trampled vegetation?! Seriously? It will be fine especially when cleanup crew gives it a good fluffing. ,rainbowgathering,d53ks1t,1,t5_2qtsh
