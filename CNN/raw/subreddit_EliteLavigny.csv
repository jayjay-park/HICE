4313781,0,t1_csbvc81,One of the biggest arguments Ive seen for giving Sirius an Imperial Shipyard is the Clipper presently they do not have a discounter Clipper in their space so Its simply not an option to buy one through their discounts. Obviously this is only one ship but its certainly an important ship getting more of our navy into clippers benefits us greatly. As for Sirius I suppose it will most likely depend on their relationship with the Federation and Alliance.  If the Federation does continue to stay hostile to them it wouldnt be much trouble for us to help out in those conflicts. We already spend  of our time fighting them anyway. Really it wouldnt even require Lavignys Legion or most of Lavignys Navy to make a considerable positive impact in Sirius space a wing of combat pilots could make a lot of difference over a few weeks and probably set updefend a buffer system to help out.

Someone posted this to a post I made on the dangerous forum and its a great idea!credit to ureganheathInstead of allowing players to earn as many merits as they like have at each rank a merit requirement they must reach that week. If they reach that requirement  weeks running increase their rank. If they fail to reach the target  weeks running decrease their rank.So to reach rank  would require  weeks of support reaching the rank requirement each week.So you cannot buy your way there by dropping a load of credits and you cannot grind your way there by spending hours and hours merit farming.The requirements each week would be small enough that players could achieve them without spending so many hours doing it that they have no time to do other things.,EliteLavigny,ct2gvdx,2,t5_38hqh
4544793,0,t1_ct3gpfk,A tangential rant that many of us in ALD share believe me. There were many possible ways to fix their mess without making it look like favoritism. They were warned their system was crap weeks in advance. It could have been fixed prior to the ALD turmoil even simply prohibiting expansion during turmoil would have been enough. But as Timon once said Youve got to put your behind in the past.And you are entirely correct in your tactical analysis at least as far as Im concerned. That said fighting the Federation is quite frankly a boring affair. We both know that the Empire and the Federation and the Alliance will always exist in one form or another.

There is amazing potential for the quick flip and a long game possibility to get nearly every system in this region to Patronage or Feudal.There is currently one active civil war which could benefit a feudal faction though it isnt for system control. The Lords of Koirisas are are stuck in a civil war with the Koirisas CoOperative while Koirisas INC reigns supreme. I believe there was only one outpost in the entire system.Another couple of controlling Patronage factions are running very low percentages so if Janja Patrons Principles and Chhaleenes Imperial Society could be given a few mission boosts while youre in the area theyd appreciate it.There are also a couple of controlling Dictatorships in Araman and DewiXilaga.

5125473,0,t1_cv3itqd,Personally I think the leadership are doing a pretty good job in difficult circumstances.There was a different shape to the leadership for the first few cycles which was a learning curve for everyone many of those leaders packed up bags and left. I feel the faction was at a difficult place when that happened the current leadership group picked things up and there was a very apparent conscious decision not to give out orders but to try and simply support the notion of good practice whatever that might actually mean.The challenge for ALD is the nature of the rewards in that it is a combat orientated faction where many players will not be interested in building sustainable networks of systems rather they simply want to know where the action is and to get stuck in for a few hours and why not.The problem at the moment is one of legacy in that we are carrying as a power baggage resulting from mistakes made in the first few cycles and there is no easy way to shed the systems we want to and to rebuild a power based on solid good practice. I am certain that if we could simply start with the capital system and nothing else the current leadership would be more than capable of building a structure capable of challenging for the number one slot. So know how isnt the problem rather it is how to keep a whole range of players relatively happy week by week whilst slowly moulding the system network into something more sustainable. For some reason things just will not settle down powers are more interested in undermining and destructive activities so we end up doing a lot of work to stand still. We do get rewarded for our efforts and I feel this is the key. I bust a gut for the first two cycles to get to rank  and after a few weeks of fortifying stuff I was able to get my Anaconda and then to kit it out. I am now at the point with M in my cash reserves so the weekly pay check doesnt go anywhere much. I am kind of hoping for a ship to come out which costs a lot more than I currently have got and that my efforts can count for something personal to be honest I would simply be happy spending all of that on a paint job for my Anaconda just to look down the top of the nose and see it in Ferrari red or British racing green. In the meantime I along with many others just chip in where we can and what will be will be at the end of the day Elite is a game my first proper computer game back in the eighties and as such I will happily do my bit for sentimental reasons spending hours trucking garrison supplies for a faction was something I dreamt of doing back then in a wire frame Cobra so I for one aint complaining now.,EliteLavigny,cv3t8hk,7,t5_38hqh

5175681,0,t1_cv7q3m3,Hmm. You make a good point and Im not really sure how I feel about that. At first glance it seems unlikely that starting systems would revolt in such a way. However because were not talking about nationstates it may not be so cut amp dried. Theres nothing to say that those systems were from the start any more or less loyal than those we have now they were simply loyal at that early stage.We can perhaps look more to feudal times where loyalty by way of being an original part of a certain state was not at all guaranteed. The House of Burgundy for instance took advantage of a particular type of autonomy to basically break away from the Kingdom of France for a long while  and many of the parts that went with it would have been considered integrally French then and now.Really the list of examples from Feudal history is manifold loyalty to a given state was entirely the responsibility of that state to maintain. The territories themselves could and would break away whenever a better deal or liege could be had and retribution be protected against. The smaller states themselves rested on the whims of individuals with little or no bureaucracy as we know today which for all its faults protects against such whims.The Holy Roman Empire Im referring primarily what is now Germany from  to  C.E. though the HRE extended further at various times is an even better example. Our systems that revolt return  most usually  to a position of being direct vassals of the Emperor rather than by way of Arissa. In the HRE becoming a direct vassal rather than by way of a given Duke or various equivalent titles was considered a great promotion for lack of a better word.Im just thinking my way through this but perhaps it is a different sort of liegevassal relationship we might consider when thinking of the systems loyal to Arissa.The game places an emphasis upon creating your own narrative and at times Ive had to rewrite my own due to the actions of other people be they developers or players.EDIT We might consider one other thing those systems lost were loyal until we failed to protect them adequately whether we could have or not. That is historically an extremely common reason for a colony vassal or ally to break from the fold.,EliteLavigny,cv9uymd,1,t5_38hqh

Maybe ADL should look into this.The problem with crap systems is something Hudson and ALD suffer from. The rather easy expansion method nearly guarantees any successful preparation. So even if there was a way to shed systems youd just get them back with the now huge CC gain and the easy method both powers have in system acquisition. To propose a change youd need to change the whole mechanics. Which i doubt is something Fdev will do.

7449774,0,t3_4h8qu3,I have been combat focused for a couple weeks.  Totally have the capability to do logistics and Ive been a trader before.  Combat is easy.  Go to this one place  find several people there wing up and kill endless bad guys.  Profit. Logistics has endless choices.  Do I trade cargo?  What does my destination require or is there a profitable destination along the way.  What other systems could I hit to make a loop?  No central location to meet up or find people so Im largely on my own unless someone happens to be in discord  but those are usually combat folks. Okay  whining in useless so what is my suggestion for improvement?  Less choice.  From the spreadsheet I have a prioritized list of systems to fortify... I could bring my  or  fortifications there  but Im on my own to figure out if I should be impatient and buy more wait around or figure out a loop.  So could we post a meetup time in Kamadhenu to start a logistics wing  or post loops in the top  logistics priorities?  Or if Im wrong and someone is really good at putting together a loop  I need a tutorial on making the quick decisions.  Its too easy to get into minmaxing of profitlogistics and waste hours on websites rather then in game.  ,EliteLavigny,d2ozqki,1,t5_38hqh

Particularly compounded in power play seems the level of npc interaction is balanced for PP and non PP participants but for those in PP you get the superposition of both not to mention the pulse rails they sometimes still have apparently.,EliteLavigny,d4izmri,1,t5_38hqh
9964867,0,t3_5i2r7y,The thing that surprises me about ALDs whining about Fifth Column activity c is that the c mechanism could have been stopped long ago if the Powers Leadership Forum which has a direct line to Frontier had agreed on the changes to the rules that they wanted.  I would have thought that the ALD leadership would have been keen to agree something  but no  it was left to others to put proposals forward. Pah! ALD  Im afraid your position is selfinflicted not least through your arrogance.  Winters has been both No and No  now its your turn.,EliteLavigny,db6g58q,-9,t5_38hqh

10722104,0,t3_5t9zez,Looks like the others have covered most of what youve asked so far Im just going to add a couple things.First of all Powerplay mechanics are quite complex at first glance and the game lies to your face sometimes.  The good thing is many people have already seen through the games lies.  If youre ever confused by any numbers in the game go ahead and ask.  Youre more likely to get a faster response time on our discord than you are on Reddit but even Reddit will be fairly timely with answers.Two theres a big bolded button above all the topics labeled Cycle Priorities.  Thats constantly updated as we get new information and can help direct you to any activities you would like to do in support of the power at any one time.  The other buttons also contain useful information but the Cycle Priorities is the most important one.,EliteLavigny,ddlwm5y,4,t5_38hqh

And yes being friendly or allied with the Empire will increase the speed at which your reputation increases with Empirealigned minor factions which in turn usually increases your mission variety from that faction and thus you have more opportunity to complete Imperial missions faster.So no bounty hunting does not affect your Imperial rank. It does affect your reputation which can indirectly benefit your rank progression attempts.,EliteLavigny,delfdnb,2,t5_38hqh
