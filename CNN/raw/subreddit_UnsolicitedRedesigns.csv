Googles current new tab page is a joke Having two search bars without any distinct functionality and a huge Google logopadding so you always have to scroll to be able to reach those quickaccess tiles or whatever they are called. Im also fond of the tab overview which currently is kind of a mess  even though I prefer the oldoldview which did not have any thumbnails.gt The status bar has its own colour too. It would look better if it didntgtThis is why I picked a more blueish grey from the Material Design colour palette which also makes the now white statusbar content clearly readable.Clearly readable? Highly debatable definitely worse than before  no problem for me but I wouldnt be sure for people who dont have perfect sight or when you use your phone in sunlight...,UnsolicitedRedesigns,clqfre3,1,t5_2sqdj

Other images closely related to Perl  are an onion the logo of the Perl Foundation which I believe came from one of the first keynotes by Larry Wall and the velociraptor pictured in the redesign which I believe comes from a keynote given by  Matt S. Trout.,UnsolicitedRedesigns,cov4175,2,t5_2sqdj
