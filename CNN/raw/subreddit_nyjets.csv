My personal favorite thing about him is his composure though. He never seems like the moment is too big at least in the first season. He had the late drives. The jets got in some holes this year and whether they came back or not it seemed geno was always calm on the sideline. I dont hate Sanchez but I definitely think he had many times where he got rattled and compounded his mistakes into more mistakes I dont think that will be an issue with Geno.

Stop and actually think about his situation.  He was a rookie quarterback surrounded by c  receiver talent at best. He was the starting qb who guided the team to  wins. Give all the credit to the dline or whoever you feel deserves praise but the fact is he got better as the year progressed and ended the season last  weeks as one of the top qb ratings during that stretch nd i think. Now he gets a touchdown machine in decker and we can still draft another playmaker for geno. No one seems to have genos back not even his own fans. ,nyjets,cg3qix3,6,t5_2s2av

You already know Namath who called Superbowl III while we were the most heavily bet against underdogs in Superbowl history to this day. We also had Curtis Martin who was a HoF running back and another favorite was Chrebet a small WR that came on as an UDFA and worked the slot until concussions did him in. There is also of course the Sack Exchange led by Joe Klecko. Our rivalries are with the Pats who the newer fans hate more the Phins who are our older rivals and the Bills who no one really hates. Outside of the division we hate the Steelers who ended our deep playoff run last time and the Raiders too but I cant remember why exactly. The modern day Jets are a group headed by HC Rex and a team with a chip on their shoulder from the media the Pats and the Giants who all make fun of us.

Unfortunately one guy shit his pants and everybody else got injured. Now theyre dragging bodies off the street to start week to week.

2266178,0,t1_clrqsqn,Can you please provide some analysis as to why you think that? Seriously your post contributes absolutely nothing except your own misguided opinion. Why is he a shitty GM? Do you have any better moves you would have made? Let me guess resigned Revis and another corner you would have gotten DeSean Jackson you would have made better picks in the drafts and the Jets would be on a path to the Super Bowl right now correct? If it was so easy then how come GM and coach turnover is ridiculously high in the NFL? How is he terrible? He didnt turn around a dead in the water franchise into a super bowl contender in two years? Do you know why we are the laughing stock of the NFL? We make stupid rash decisions based on the fans.Do you think Ted Thompson of the Packers is a good GM? Well when he took over he had some difficult decisions to make in  the team had to release starting safety Darren Sharper an  year vet similar to Revis in that he was a fan favorite trying to get back to his best football. The decision that was best for the team was made Sharper was cut where he went to Minnesota a divisional rival.  Along with Sharper a fan favorite in guard Mike Wahle was also cut. The team had previous success under Mike Sherman winning  division titles. They also in  Thompsons first season Shermans one and only season with Thompson suffered two injuries to starting RBs Ahman Green and Najeh Davenport similar to how we lost two corners. Thompsons first season Sherman went went  for the worst record for the Packers since . Sherman was subsequently fired and Thompson got to bring his own coach in McCarthy who has been good ever since. Everyone questions Idziks drafting well in  the Packers had  picks. The first two he hit on Aaron Rodgers and Nick Collins but the other ? only three players Mike Montgomery Junius Coston and Brady Poppinga played for longer than  seasons with the Packers. In  he had similar success with only  of his  daft picks making the roster! Getting his own QB in Rodgers and getting his own HC in Thompson is what has helped the Packers to their success was Thompson fired after  seasons? Mind you Idzik has not actually been here  full years.The point is Idzik needs time. Rex needs to go and we need to trust that this man has an idea of what he is doing. To claim he is a shitty GM after  seasons and that he needs to go is absolutely ludacris. Who should we hire to replace him? Do you think a good well known personnel man is going to come in knowing the last GM got  seasons before the fans clamored for his head? Not going to happen. We are making progress whether or not a few blind eyes in the fan base can see that getting rid of Idzik now will be taking even more steps backwards. ,nyjets,clrtice,5,t5_2s2av

2516496,0,t1_cmmunpk,. I feel elite arm strength and accuracy are conflicting reports because he loses accuracy past the  yard mark.

The decisions that he tries to force in college which nearly get picked off would be pick sixes in the NFL. Bad decision making is the hardest component of the game to adjust and he makes plenty of bad decisions.. I cant and wont argue with that hes definitely able to keep plays alive and avoid dlinemen.. The blitz doesnt faze him because he faces very weak defenses. The only defenses hes faced that are good  Louisville and Clemson for one half  absolutely rattled him with the blitz. Forced bad throws interceptions dropped by college players that any NFL players who arent on this years Jets defense.. His prostyle offense plays very soft defenses. Its much harder to project how hell play against solid defenses like other mobile NFL QBs have.. He leads his team out of the holes that he digs them into lol.

RATExtrapolate those stats for a full season and you have   yds  TD  INT . RATObviously it is completely unrealistic to expect him to post numbers like that but the point is that Geno has looked good in recent action. Even if you take away the Miami game and look at the other  games in this stretch he was still putting up average numbers.

4001399,1,t1_crc5c0m,Thanks for the reply. I do have to disagree. Ill try to lay out why..gtAny person with a functioning ability to reason can tell Brady was directly involved in  some capacity just by how he is acting about the investigation. This isnt a court of law the NFL does not need evidence beyond the shadow of a doubt. However I think the NFL has enough evidence where they could get a conviction in court anyways if this were in fact a public case simply based off the phone records.The problem with this is that It may very well be true that Brady is directly involved in some capacity. However we do not know that for sure. You can deride my ability to reason all you wish but that doesnt prove it conclusively. Im more than willing to admit that its a possibility and as Ive said many times if it is proved I wont blindly come to his defenseIll criticize him. Regardless of how it looks to you you do not have all the facts. Its the armchair jury thing that bothers me.  You say He is acting just like I do when I get caught and I think there is still a chance of getting out of it I act dumb and I dont cooperate. Well no shit thats what any normal person would do. And Im sure its what he was advised to do. Heck take the phone thing. People are using that to paint Brady with the brush of guilt but he may have been advised to not share them to say nothing of possibly being worried about personal things on his phone which is justifiable. The NFL does not have the evidence to get a conviction. Not when lawyers with actual law experience have looked at this and concluded otherwise go read the abovethelaw piece and not when the evidence is as shaky as it is not to mention the term conviction isnt really the right one but thats just quibbling.gtI dont see how the evidence gathered suggest there is even a slight hope of innocence here between the ball boys the phone records the camera etc. Suggesting Brady or New England is innocent is pretty ridiculous now. I think its possible maybe even likely that Kraft and Bill Belichick had no clue about what was happening with the balls but that doesnt change that at least some New England employees and Tom Brady himself were undeniably involved.Given the problems with the report leaving the possibility open that even if NE did try to manipulate the balls it wasnt necessarily outside the legal boundaries you would be hardpressed to prove guilt. All the evidence is circumstantial and can be explained away by various means. The deflator texts...despite the presence of an excuse I will grant that it sounds really really fucking stupid. I still dont entirely buy it. But I dont know maybe its so stupid its legit. I dont know. But aside from that....I think theres reason to defend Brady for his decision not to hand over his phone. I think theres reason to defend the refusal to go back for more interviews after the emails that have come out after the stuff about him trying to meet them partway and being refused etc. I think theres plenty of uncertainty as far as the actual deflating given the less than airtight handling by the refs and the tenuousness of the timeline that we have for the employee...enough to have doubt at least. gtSo weve established the rules have been knowingly bent. Disagree as explained above. It hasnt been conclusively established at least not yet.gtThis leads the the punishment which is admittedly a bit on the harsh side for deflating balls in a game that was clearly going to be won anyways. But is the punishment UNREASONABLY harsh? Absolutely not and that has to do with...truncated for length but Im quoting here to the endThe problem with this is that youre arguing the NFL tailored its punishment to the Patriots basing it on their competitiveness as a team the length and its impact on playoff hunt and the draft picks. This is incorrect. The NFL is not supposed to do this. If it came out that the NFL decided a punishment this arbitrarily it would not be good for the league. And when the punishment seems greatly out of scale compared to others Bountygate for ex....thats concerning.Also your point about the fine misses the point entirely. The problem is that it is to date the largest such fine ever levied and in fact was applied as two k fines as a means of circumventing the k maximum in the CBA. So...so what if it was pennies? The significance is still notable.Ill address the TLDR quicklygtNot just for rule bending but for being repeat rule benders and for being rule benders who dont cooperate with investigators. The former is based solely on Spygate I get it but gtThe slight perceived harshness comes from New Englands constant willingness to bend rules and Constant is false. gtcoupled with being a perennial contender which both need to be discouraged.This doesnt make sense. The NFL punishes teams for being contenders now?gtIf the punishment was much less severe it risks not being a strong enough punishment to affect the organization at all which is the final goal. The final goal is to discourage New England from bending rules YET AGAIN in the future by punishing them good enough where it hurts to sit down this season.Fair enough. In summary I just think theres some issues with this response and feel free to debate me on this I enjoy a healthy debate. I disagree with you that we can judge Bradys involvement or guilt that easily and your section on the punishment is quantifiably inaccurate. Essentially the thing that we all have an issue with besides the report itself which requires no explanation for its issues is that there have been enough reasons to cast doubt on Bradys guilt. Could he be guilty? Sure. Ill happily admit I was wrong if thats the case and you can tag meIm a realistic guy. But until more facts come out Im against premature judgments and I think he deserves his day in court. Thats my view at least. Look forward to your response and hope we can have a pleasant debate. Apologies for the length of my response btw and hopefully its all clear I wrote it pretty fast.,nyjets,crce2x2,2,t5_2s2av

5195002,0,t1_cvc6flo,You should. I mean Fitzpatrick is an error prone robot. Hes afraid of getting off the play when the play asks for him to get off it but will randomly ignore the directions given when those directions are leading him to the best result.Geno is a far more creative player in the way he follows the play and breaks it but that also leads to more egregious errors while also giving more opportunities for highlight plays.Heres a great examplest and  at CHI   Shotgun G.Smith pass deep left intended for D.Nelson INTERCEPTED by K.Fuller at CHI . compare that with this Shotgun R.Fitzpatrick pass incomplete short right. PENALTY on INDV.Davis Defensive Holding  yards enforced at IND   No Play. Geno looks through  reads finds all of them are covered well Ivory has a chance but Genos pocket movement as he backs away from Ferguson puts him out of the position to take the throw so he bails and throws it up for David Nelson. Now imagine that David Nelson is Brandon Marshall. What kind of leverage does he have on rookie Kyle Fuller the moment Geno releases the ball? What kind of fight does he put up for this ball?

Im Pro Fitz but he makes too many throws into coverage lacks arm strength but has been making a lot of good plays in the intermediate the last few weeks and sometimes doesnt seem to go through progressions.

Chip Kelly does this to the point that it irks a lot of Eagles fans. After we beat Dallas a reporter tried to get him to say this was an extra important game because its our big division rival. Chip sarcastically commented that he might just not show up for next weeks Dolphins game since theyre not in the same conference. I agree though. Definitely the sign of a good coach. When you hype certain games up as extra important it ultimately sends the message that other games arent important and takes focus off of doing your job week in and week out.,nyjets,cy7x3zy,2,t5_2s2av

We just didnt deserve it and we showed this team is still a year away.  wins on an easy schedule and a lot of vets we need to find replacements for. Most of all despite his play sometimes Ryan Fitzpatrick Fitzpatrick is not a good QB. He has a noodle arm and can hold the ball too long sometimes. If Decker and Marshall werent two of the better wide outs in the game he would have nowhere near the stats he has. We need a QB. As always its priority number  for the Jets. I think this is a good year to get a first round talent at QB in a relatively weak class. We can get the  or  QB where we are in the draft. But it could be another Geno deal.More than anything we need real guards and tackles. The line did well against very weak DLines this year. Clearly they were overpowered by the better dlines. Unless the anchor was in front of Mangold the Jets sucked vs good dlines.Im sorry to go off on a rant but this team got all my hopes up. This was gonna be the team. Now were near square .

Fitz is not an upgrade to either one.Rams?  Depends on whos the OC.If teams only want to acquire Fitz as a backup the Jets have a screaming advantage.  No one is going to pay low starter money for Fitz probably to sit as a backup.  st year should be what the market will bear but for an extended contract I cant see paying him more than  milyear for him as a backup in the next four years. And Id rather pay  milyear.Then you have to look at it from Fitzs point of view.  He doesnt really want to move from team to team for the rest of his career.  I dont think starter is so important to him that he would want to switch teams if benched.  If hes realistic about what he wants his future backup QB money to be he takes what the market will give him for the first year and then he coasts on his backup QBmentor status until it makes sense for him to retire.Fitz is not going to be a popular QB for the Jets after next season.  Next season will be brutal.  Fans will be clamoring for a QB that can spread it out to  different targets.  That just isnt Fitz.  And dont forget well be seeing a decline in Marshall as well a la Holmes?.   But teams always needs a backup QB and if its not overly generous Fitz has a place where he will be remembered somewhat fondly before he retires.On the other hand he may imprint his sons to be Jets fans if he stays a Jet.

6190644,0,t3_409mh9,I would be pretty upset. Sure Zeke is an incredible college player but we have much bigger needs e.g. OL and LB. Furthermore RBs have a very low hit ratio. Take a look at first round running backs and tell me which ones have been worth the pick. In the past  years Im only counting AD and maybe Gurley which remains to be seen. Many of the other players who have had recent success arent on their original team Lynch Dangelo Willians and McFadden or have been up and down throughout their career Doug Martin Stewart and Ingram.Next point RBs are low cost free agents. Investing a high pick in a RB is a poor financial decision. Good RBs can be purchased in Free agency for relatively low contracts. I would rather sign someone like Forte and draft an OL or Edge rusher. Top edge players or OL are rarely available in the off season and when they are they get paid premium  MM easily. I would much rather draft a mid to late round running back who is specialized receiving and bring back Ivory or Powell at MM and continue to have an aggressive RB pair. ,nyjets,cytb7j2,1,t5_2s2av

The reason I ask is if that is the case it would seem shortsighted to put a young QB Smith Petty or Hack behind an offensive line that will not allow them time. Looking at Dallas that offensive line and rushing attack are creating a proper environment where Prescott is allowed to gradually take on a greater load. In NY based on my limited observation only an elite QB could play behind that line and succeed and even then weve seen Brady and Rodgers struggle when their offensive lines play like crap. In short baptism by fire is a bad idea. ,nyjets,d8xwbak,1,t5_2s2av

Not many good games honestly and the lack of parity is really beginning to strain my fandom of the sport on top of the officiating issues shitty penalty rules politics and a bunch of other shit. This was just the cherry on top. I mean other than the NBA which has an entirely different problem that I hate fucking super teams the complete lack of parity on the AFC side just makes me wonder why I even bother. Why the hell should I watch a game next season? I can already guess who will be in the playoffs. I might as well just not watch till the AFCNFC Championship games. Next year is going to be a lost cause for the Jets we already know this. Hell our fate for the next  seasons is basically a given we cannot compete for the last WC spots. Rome wasnt built in a day and the Jets cant be built back into contention in a year. Im sure ill watch because what the fuck else am I gonna do but this is the first time I can remember honestly asking myself if I should even bother.

The actual figures are  with  dead with a savings of  for Revis. You can easily sign a replacement with the cap savings while getting a higher level of play and sending a good message in the locker room. Henderson will save .m and has completely disappeared on the field. Marshall saves .m declining old and is playing at a deep position. No dead money at a luxury position for us not to mention what sells tickets should not come into the equation. Look what bringing back Fitz did and that was the same reasoning. We need to make smart decisions not popular ones. Folk is due top  money at his position and is playing like a top  player but I think saving the m and develop a younger player on this rebuilding team is probably the smarter move.,nyjets,ddlboy3,3,t5_2s2av

10745654,1,t1_ddob9m5,i dont see a difference if youre arguing it creates another threat in the backfield i agree but it doesnt particularly improve the QB in any tangible way only hides them just like youre saying. less pressure will only live up as long as the games are kept within close margins because as soon as the team falls behind two scores the RB becomes less and less useful and the QB gets the pressure placed on them regardless. personally i dont even really think a QB does develop much and beyond a few very large cases like Brady most guys look nearly the same right now as they did in college even the good ones.i guess that means what hes saying wouldnt be its a massive crutch for a developing QB but it helps hide the flaws of your QB instead.so i dont consider the RBs value to that because i consider it to be a marginal benefit and not a significant one. youre still going to end up searching for a QB if your QBs being hidden by your run game. instead im looking at whether the RB is a significantly greater add to the team than any other option available and if spending the premium on them is going to be worth it. does fournette improve the team so greatly at  that he stands head and shoulders above all other options?,nyjets,ddobzcd,-3,t5_2s2av

10931427,0,t3_5w51ho,Ideal free agency for me would be signing Geno back for  mil. Getting Okung would be great but hes gonna look for a long term deal and Im not comfortable giving him one. A guy like Riley Reiff or Kevin Beachum would be ideal. I think either could be snagged for  million per year especially Reiff and would be an immediate upgrade over Clady for a similar price. Im OK rolling with Shell at RT to replace Giacomimi. If we spend any substantial money this season it has to be at corner. Bowles needs one to have his scheme work. Theres two guys I want to go all in for and three lower risk and high reward deals. First we need to get in on Stephen Gilmore AJ Bouye and Trumaine Johnson. At least one of those three is very likely not ending up with their prior team. I could see all three being in different unis. After cuts we should have a decent amount of space. Personally Gilmore is my choice because hes a great corner and it would piss off the Bills. As for the low risk signings I think we can get good value out of Prince Amukamara Morris Claiborne or Captain Munnerlyn. Prince and Claiborne may be more expensive than some low risk deals but Claiborne has only proved he can be a solid corner for half a season and Prince is up and down. Cap is the one i really really want. He should only cost  million per year and is another big upgrade for our secondary. They should all end up in the  range as far as per year salaries go and we can definitely get at least two of these guys. Ideally I want Cap and Claiborne. I think Claibornes year wasnt a fluke and Bowles can really get the most out of his physical gifts. Cap is a veteran presence along with being a very good number  corner or a fringe . We likely cant Fix all of our holes in FA but I think we can fix the biggest outside QB.Anticipated Cap Space . million cuts Marshall Henderson Mangold roll with Wes Clady Gilchrist Revis Harris and trading Richardson source.Sign remaining spaceDraft picks  Mil . milIjalana . or  mil . milBruce Carter  mil is probably generous. Really just want him back for veteran depth. . milGeno Smith  mil. He wont get more than that anywhere and he knows the citymediasystem. Worst case hes a back up. Best case we see how he does with some talent. . milStephon Gilmore . mil  milCaptain Munnerlyn  million  milBeachum  million  milDJ Hayden  million. Hes not going to get much and has been regarded as one of the worst corners in the league but he was a first rounder and I want to see if theres anything there. Only .  milMarcus Williams . million. Try a free safety experiment maybe?  milKenny Britt  million. Younger and cheaper than Brandon Marshall he is way more talented than his poor Rams numbers indicate. He may be a little too pricey for us at the end of the day but a nice raise to  mil.

11307531,0,t3_61co5c,Well theyre a division rival for one. The most successful of the three at that. Two that spygate thing still pisses me off. Three theyre so pompous about it that its disgusting. They dont respect us as a team. At all. Im not talking about the fans either. Brady and Bellicheat literally hate the Jets. They snub their noses at us any chance they get.

11330493,0,t3_61nk6z,I believe in Hack and Petty. Not sure why I do. I think if petty gets the starting gig he will flop the first couple of games then slowly progress thru the season. Well have a shit record when it is all said and done but I think the kid will do alright. Well know what we have in our qbs and continue to build into the  draft. Of course I base this all off of nothing more than hope and senseless optimism. Edit fuck the Pats,nyjets,dfgajfi,1,t5_2s2av
