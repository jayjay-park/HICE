5070907,0,t1_cux88ts,I have no idea of the proposed performance of their orbital rocket. Any info is appreciated!,BlueOrigin,cux8i7d,1,t5_2y5rj
6615285,0,t1_d038g8c,gt But New Shephard isnt similar to any commercially used flight hardware either... Because Blue Origin hasnt flown a commercial mission.Reading charitably he has changed the criteria from commercially used to intended for commercial use I dont feel like this is a valid complaint.Agreed on the dick measuring.,BlueOrigin,d03ks0d,3,t5_2y5rj
6891731,0,t3_49umu9,This is an interesting new leaf  I like it  really good to see the ins and outs of this company  long may it continue,BlueOrigin,d0xhumd,3,t5_2y5rj
7744123,0,t1_d3m8mzf,This is the sort of thing the FAA requires for commercial aircraft certification.  I expect they will be requiring at least the same level of testing for commercial spacecraft.,BlueOrigin,d3mg87s,2,t5_2y5rj

7995664,0,t3_4opt20,Ive been waiting for this since the day I heard about Blue Origin. Im glad they start to be more open. I hope the stream is gonna be awesome.,BlueOrigin,d4esedl,3,t5_2y5rj
8001123,0,t3_4opt20,Was that a montage of the same launch at the end? That was quick.,BlueOrigin,d4fehn4,4,t5_2y5rj
8029666,0,t1_d4ijuac,Ive rephrased my question.  Based on the deltav of New Shepard in this article  and the deltav requirement to get to low Martian orbit  it seems to be ms off the pace.  Definitely close though I think with a few tweaks it could make a great orbital launch vehicle for Mars.,BlueOrigin,d4ilykr,2,t5_2y5rj
9088037,0,t1_d8488lu,Nothing right now they only have equipment in one room not the Blue Origin room.,BlueOrigin,d848hfw,1,t5_2y5rj
9163477,0,t1_d8dijw0,Youre probably right. I guess it could be some kind of lateload cargo but the fact that they say its for a suborbital flight suggests that its not the abort test.,BlueOrigin,d8djd64,2,t5_2y5rj
9175668,0,t1_d8f2vrp,Shirro is make joke comrade.  Helium bottles and boats in exclusion zones are some things that have variously delayed or cancelled launch attempts by SpaceX in recent memory.,BlueOrigin,d8f30e1,3,t5_2y5rj
9184566,0,t1_d8fn96j,that is probably related to how the centre of thrust and centre of mass interact. Once the thrust stops the capsule is left to the whims of aerodynamics.,BlueOrigin,d8g7lxa,1,t5_2y5rj
9414600,0,t3_59hnzt,Amortizing costs between reuse and RampD is very hard. We dont know how many NGs will be built.I would imagine that between all of it its probably between  to  million per vehicle.... less reuse costs,BlueOrigin,d99d707,2,t5_2y5rj
9683214,0,t1_da66v89,Although I doubt all the material could be used alot of asteroids are not much more than rubble certainly not enough tensile strength in all the material to hold on to a rotating cylinder. Also if you say held the material in with an outer shell you would likely need to use refined asteroids to create that outer shell as well as needing a lot of asteroid material to serve as raw materials for manufacturing of basically everything.Still that is a frankly massive amount of potential space.,BlueOrigin,da6nsfg,7,t5_2y5rj
10725192,0,t3_5tfbas,Good info but did you have any info on the capsule deceleration?  Im curious if it would get to g or if it would decelerate more smoothly aside from the brief spike when the chutes open,BlueOrigin,ddm82cy,8,t5_2y5rj
10788386,0,t3_5u258o,does anyone know what the projected completion date of this site is? ,BlueOrigin,ddsqtvi,2,t5_2y5rj
11018465,0,t1_defynca,The roaring s...,BlueOrigin,degwutz,15,t5_2y5rj
11066966,0,t3_5y0b1a,Spacex has been developing all the reusable capability since  .Then Blue origin stole the Spacex ITS architecture in  amp embedded that reusability into its New glenn vehicle.Now matter which company incorporate all those spacexs innovativative ideasStill Spacex is the father of Reusabilty amp will remain in the future.,BlueOrigin,demfhu3,-24,t5_2y5rj
11070359,0,t1_demf56g,Or if Proton loses its launch license again...We now have a lot of vehicles on the commercial market.,BlueOrigin,demtcfo,2,t5_2y5rj
11119276,0,t1_derkars,gt Aerojet has been working closely with Dynetics on a few projectsThey were partnered together on the attempted ULA buyout as well.,BlueOrigin,desd0jp,2,t5_2y5rj
11159138,0,t1_dewvfcj,Its still an elaborate fanassessment that contradicts the capability for the rocket on SpaceXs website.  Until they say Correction we said kg and used that figure repeatedly in public speeches too but actually and this is a funny story...  it turns out we totally forgot about the payload limit of the payload adapter.  Whoops! then it seems like a stretch to treat that limit as a hard truth.,BlueOrigin,dewvk10,1,t5_2y5rj
11184358,0,t3_5zk99x,Within a year and within the next year are two very different things. The articles headline does not reflect the actual comment. Thats artificially changing the timeline from  months to .,BlueOrigin,dezqfqf,5,t5_2y5rj
11201717,0,t1_df0hzah,gt Slow custom and expensive in other words. You know Boeing and Lockheed are in the airplane business.,BlueOrigin,df1p82n,2,t5_2y5rj
11219799,0,t1_df2e7j8,Yup totally agreed. Hopefully we can have another suggestion thread if we do a second annual survey!,BlueOrigin,df3r0ox,1,t5_2y5rj
11238733,0,t1_df5obzl,It wasnt for a buisiness model profit that I was commenting on for SpaceX. We all now they have stated clearly that they would not enter thr suborbital Tourist market. But from the perspective of encouraging more spacefarers. Enthusiasm for Spaceflight. Support. Congress. NASA. Funding. ITS. Their stated future for going to Mars.An investment in the Spaceflight community if you would. ,BlueOrigin,df5w760,2,t5_2y5rj
11484014,0,t1_dfwwups,I think it was M for the original Falcon  M IIRC for it and Dragon.  Figure at least as much over the years for the Merlin upgrades new octaweb other related designs.  Its still probably well less than Blue but not a remarkable difference.,BlueOrigin,dfxpm0y,2,t5_2y5rj
11650314,0,t3_6650i9,Have they priced it yet?,BlueOrigin,dggksby,3,t5_2y5rj
11683489,0,t1_dgkbwvr,Probably. I wish I could watch it as it happens.,BlueOrigin,dgkc9ug,3,t5_2y5rj
