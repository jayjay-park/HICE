5742465,0,t1_cx8j9xq,Well I didnt find it. I managed to siege down a small isolated Dwarf kingdom that had actual Castles and twice as much technology and a lot more garrison than I had boats took ages . per  days and reformed with the decision you mention after I moved my capital to their old capital. Was quite the shock to go from  tribal warriors including horse archers to  light infantry levies but Ill have to rebuild for a while.On a side note it might have to do with the fact that I was in the Chaos Wastes wasteland terrain so the castle might not have been an option or something. I started a game as the wood elves of thisandthat kingdom and they had the actual hillfort chain that my Kul Tzeentchian guy didnt have. I shouldve conquered those dwarves way sooner. ,CK2warhammer,cx8wpko,1,t5_37w44
8703300,0,t3_4pvcm7,Read the texts popups and whatnot.The mod taught me alot about Warhammer lore.Make sure to check out the main empire leaders. Make sure to read through every trait that looks new. Theres sometimes a little story written to it.The amount of detail they put in is amazing ereything is texted and i have spent a lot of time reading subtexts rather than playing.All the custom events also are very good at signaling small lore fragments.For a very first game in this mod I would recomend either. a major human force in the empire fight against bazillion undeads. Chaos raid and spread the chaos from the north. Orcs somewhere near humans crush their cities to rubble,CK2warhammer,d6tjnvx,1,t5_37w44
