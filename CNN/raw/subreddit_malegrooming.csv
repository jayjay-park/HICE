652585,0,t1_cgefgli,Derma rollers have a huge following for aiding scar tissue and general facial skin health. They come in different sizes and textures depending on how beat upwornold the face is and there are a large number of men that swear by them. Creams like quality Retin A or the like can also be used in conjunction. Ive never used one so I cant offer much help but I have friends that swear by them. For the shaving it could just be technique. Using warm water to soak your face for a couple minutes before shaving slow even strokes of the blade and always making sure the blade is sharp could all help. But if hes a contact martial artist noncompliant grappling or sparring not just forms practice or punching the air it might be something hell have to live with. He can minimize it by shaving better and moisturizing his face after a session even plain coconut or argan oil might help but having rugged material like a heavy canvas gi rubbed across your face a few hours a week will fuck it up.,malegrooming,cgeg5vp,7,t5_2s4uu

876555,0,t3_245eml,This all depends on how long you are wanting to grow it. If youre going for the yeard most say to let it go up until the  month range until you shape it. Although it seems as though you can start shaping it now. I wouldnt recommend doing it by yourself just yet but instead go to a barber who can show you how he does it and maybe next time you can try it at home yourself. Taper the sides and keep letting it grow! Next try using a beard balmn..Honest Amish has a good one. You wont need a lot a little goes a long way to make your beard look healthy and not dried out. However if youre on a budget...you can achieve the same effect buy buying extra virgin coconut oil and rubbing a little in here and there. Try styling your mustache a bit so it doesnt curl down...you pretty much have to train it to grow a certain way. Also I believe you really should get a haircut. A good haircut will play off the beard quite well and make it look even more badass. Try a cut like this ask for a close fade on the sides with a hard line separation. Ask for a part as well so you can have a few different ways to style it for a nice clean look. Hope this helps...cheers! ,malegrooming,ch3x2cu,2,t5_2s4uu

I use a couple drops of tea tree and orange for summer because it gives you something light for the warm weather. In the winter I do peppermint and sometimes cinnamon. Basically I just got a pack of small brown  ounce bottles and I just do equal parts of the base oils like the almond and jojoba some people call them carrier oils I think. Then add a few drops of each essential oils. You have to use them sparingly because an excess of essential oils can cause irritation. A few drops is more than enough though. Just mix them in the bottle and shake to get them combined.  AoM had a pretty decent article on mixing them yourself.

4582257,0,t3_3d9s8b,If youre using a razor make sure your face is really warm before you start. Maybe use a damp cloth or wait till youre fresh out the shower.Lather up the gel or cream and spread it on half your faceneck. Shave with the grain. Most of it will probably be downwards. Dont push hard! Get the other side of your face wet again and apply the creamgel like you did before.You may want to use a moisturizer of sorts as an aftershave.

5104606,0,t3_3kvc1s,Warning white guy here. So I had dreadlocks for almost a year. My hair is very course and wiry so it wasnt hard to do. The biggest misconception with dreadlocks is youre not supposed to wash them. Its actually the opposite. The more oil you have in your hair the more it resists the dreadlock process. Wash your hair every other day. Until youre actually ready to start the dreadlock process just take good care of your hair. Its going to get a lot of abuse soon. Once its long enough get someone to help divide sections of your hair into appropriate sized sections. A brick pattern works well. Then tie off the bottoms of those sections with rubber bands. Take a wide toothed comb and start brushing your hair down towards the scalp. You want it to bunch up and start getting knotted. After you back combed your sectioned hair just twirl and work the clumps into dreadlocks. Think of it liking working play dough into little snakes. Keep washing your hair then its just a matter of time before they fully form. ,malegrooming,cv1an7s,1,t5_2s4uu

5824863,0,t3_3uxofg,Good news! Youre not unattractive and have a nice thick head of hair!Bad news! You have no idea how to flaunt it! I have glasses similar to yours except theyre less flattened out. I think you would do well to look for a less rectangular pair. Smile and if youre not comfortable with your smile then learn how to smile. I know learn how to smile just sounds weird and condescending but I swear its a thing. Dont let your smile be all lip. Your smile is your first impression. And second impression. Just sit in front of a mirror and practice smiling with teeth. Try to find a balance between confidence and psycho. No overlyenthusiastic serial killer stuff. But whatever you settle on make sure it is comfortable for you and your face. Hair! You had better thank your grandparents for giving you such a thick head of hair. Definitely do what others have been suggesting here. Schedule an appointment with a stylist a good stylist and just take it slow. Browse the internet and magazines for styles you like consult your stylist.  Clothes! Id say drop the graphics but I dont really think thats the problem. You need clothes that fit. rmalefashionadvice is a great place to start but it can get fairly pricey very fast so keep that in mind. Generally speaking it is easier to put on weight than take it off and youd do well to hit the gym or at start a modest home workout routine. There are plenty online. I feel awkward at gyms so at home I do an hour of jogging and  minutes of core exercises every MWF as well as cut down on grains.

10310087,0,t1_dccn1n7,Nivea for men Active Age for the day. Olay regenerist at night. Key is to put more than you think you need on there. I can go through a jar of the Olay in just  weeks. Get a ton on your face and then really massage it in. For shaving I use dollar shave club but the most expensive one they have. Comes to  a month and it better than those  gillette blades. I use sensitive skin shaving cream and after shaving follow up with a moisturizing and healing vitamin after shave. Using a shaving cream brush will help lift the hair to get a closer shave but takes a while. I usually only have time for that on the weekends. Also totally related limit sugar drink lots and lots of water roughly a gallon a day eat clean dont drink alcohol I really think this has had more to do with it than anything else. I just never took to alcohol like others did and Im so glad for it. And dont smoke.,malegrooming,dccpd54,1,t5_2s4uu

On Wednesdays and Sundays I shampoocondition and then I run a little bit of oil through my hair to restore the oils that were stripped out by the shampoo.  I usually use product on my hair to style it but when I am going for a more natural look I will either use a leavein curl enhancerconditioner or use a little extra hair oil.,malegrooming,dgcz9f9,1,t5_2s4uu

I really dont know why these young barbers want to do crazy things I dont think they learned the classics properly. In my shop if youre under  I ask you to bring a picture. A word of advice to the young guys you think these crazy cuts look neat now but just remember people thought mullets bowl cuts and Beiber hair was cool once too.,malegrooming,dgsyneh,7,t5_2s4uu
