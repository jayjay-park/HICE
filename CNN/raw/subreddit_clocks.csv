It uses NTP to obtain accurate time and also records with each event a measurement of the the uncertainty of its time synchronization.Cell phones generally arent reliable to the second for example the two iPhones Ive had have been routinely off by amounts exceeding a second.  For example my iPhone s is currently about . seconds behind official time as measured by the Emerald Time app.I once had a WWWV radio controlled clock that evidently had design flaws and sometimes was off by exactly one minute.  This is a key thing to keep in mindjust because a particular technology is capable of delivering very accurate time that doesnt mean that every device that uses that tech will be reliable.  That would be my comment about the digital radio the nixie clock and phones in generalit totally depends on whether the device was designed implemented and tested to provide accurate time and this often isnt a priority for their makers.,clocks,cm3qbco,2,t5_2r2n7

7412622,0,t1_d2kp7rm,The plates dont seem to be sand cast and that would put it definitely before the s. this type of plate would put it right around the turn of the s. maybe a little before maybe a little after. Its hard to tell with Cuckoos because they werent well marked and a lot of makers upgraded their technology at different times. You got a very good price for it. In our shop in good condition it would sell from  easily. ,clocks,d2krllb,2,t5_2r2n7
