385165,0,t1_cfknsec,Thank you for the response. Im buyer.  The reason deal fell through is because of a lease contingency. I couldnt obtain the lease I wanted and the lease contingency gave me an out and I took it.  Obviously I had to fight to get it bak but so be it. Now Im fighting again   The agent is the sellers agent. I was unrepresented by an agent and now he is claiming to be my agent. nothing signed. So it sounds like he may be entitled to something.  ,CommercialRealEstate,cfkorqi,1,t5_2r1bz

2218047,0,t3_2ki3j1,Im not sure about the expense of splitting the meters up but if your property is going to be tenanted by local mom and pop type tenants they may actually prefer a gross lease. I see this  of the time on smaller centers  small retailers etc. just want a flat rental rate and operate their business. As a result you typically charge a small premium over the nets  i.e. if you were going to charge SF NNN and the nets are  maybe you charge  and call it gross.,CommercialRealEstate,cllrmii,1,t5_2r1bz

3230474,0,t1_cowt8mq,yeah or smaller office.  Its just a value thing.Lets say I have a MM SF office building listed at oh  ft.  I get two calls.  Call  says  Hey NumNum we are calling about taking a few floors.  We need k SF.  Do you have that or do you have anything else in that size range we can talk about?  Id be thinking how is the best way to get a meeting with these people for general rep if they dont want this space.   Say thats oh  years thats a  million dollar lease.  If they want demographic analysis tax credit analysissolicitations etc do it.  Now say someone calls you and says hey NumNum We want  SF we need exactly  executive offices a kitchen  conferences rooms and a kitchen.  We want to minimize TI.  The entire space must have  parking on site and we want them to voucher our clients and employees.  We want this to be close to restaurants and some recreation since many of your employees are active and would like parks etc.  We are hoping for a  year lease.     Oh and just to let you know we are working with several other brokers but we will go with whoever sends us the right property first!Fuck that shit.  I dont want to rep them at all exclusive or not. Thats like a k lease Im going to get paid like k for that bullshit after I figure out that long list of stuff and that assumes I even close.  If I see a space that absolutely matches that though I dont mind letting them know taking a look at it and closing it for them though.  I just want shit else to do with the responsibility to find them a property.  Edit  Im going to note now that I generally am an investment full service broker.  My typical client hires me to lease sell manage sometimes and represent them to buy properties.  By far the money comes from sales but Im not going to tell my client to go find another broker to do their leasing so I do it even if its small.  Our typical lease deal is k SF.  Ive never done a k SF lease deal but if I had the chance to do one yep Id be all over that   Take the good with the bad kinda thing but I understand how smaller size lease deals suck.  That probably wasnt your intended question though.,CommercialRealEstate,cowue5s,1,t5_2r1bz

You have to adjust from transactional to advisory depending on what kind of client it is. ,CommercialRealEstate,cpq9o70,1,t5_2r1bz
3754641,0,t3_32r19y,The simple answer is no BUT if Im the guy hiring you then no matter what it shows me a demonstrated commitment to the real estate profession. Same thing goes with real estate salesperson licenses. Your objective is to convince me that you are smart driven and are working to expand your skill set daily. Will you need these things daily on the job? Maybe not but having them makes you a more viable candidate. That is my two cents coming from MF investment sales at a huge shop. ,CommercialRealEstate,cqk98nc,1,t5_2r1bz

5562676,0,t3_3ra2w6,Typically people want to immediately know why youre calling and then GTFO the phone as quickly as possible. I try to limit all the fluff and sales pitch bs. Generally I tell people Im in the business of helping tenants identify a new location and negotiate favorable terms. Ill ask what problems theyre currently facing with their existing space and take the convo from there.  The goal is offering a solution which in turn adds value. If you can show proof even better. Our rent escalations are too highI am consistently able to negotiate . escalation rates And sometimes Ill bring a problem to light they didnt realize they had.

The long answer is that they will most likely not perform and will be in breach which should allow you to keep the deposit and resell the property.

8050125,0,t3_4pbx1y, Leases are typically best negotiated with a leasing broker that knows the area and is familiar with other similar leases that have been signed. They do however get a commission. If they want a long term lease give them a  year lease with annual  rent bumps. Add on two year extension options. This is a pretty standard lease from my area but calling an appraisal firm and having an abstract conversation would not hurt.The more creditable and solid the company is the more a lessor will be willing to come down on rental rate to accommodate them since there is less risk in the deal. As a property owner you want as low of a cap rate as you can get. You usually calculate a cap rate via an appraisal and comparable sells in the area.,CommercialRealEstate,d4kwr1o,1,t5_2r1bz
8339698,0,t1_d5jzqy9,Very good question.  Whats interesting for the Phoenix market is that we are delivering units at a rate some  below what we were delivering at its height preGreat Recession.  For example preRecession MF was delivering approximately  to  units per month Garden style units   stories on less with multiple buildingsphases  considering we had very few midrise to high rise that number wouldnt change much.  Now those same garden style units are delivering between  to  units per month which is  to  per quarter.  As a result of the decreased delivery has allowed Phoenix Metro as a whole to absorb units more quickly thus our historically high occupancy rate currently at  has barely been affected if at all.  Nonetheless over these next  quarters Phoenixs construction type will significantly change i.e. from garden style centric to midrise centric.  As a result this should increase the amount of average unit deliveries to the  to  unit range which should see occupancy levels begin a downward trend starting Q and beyond.  However it should be noted that current renewal rates for the metro are the best weve ever seen according to the property management firms I survey.  It will be interesting to see if that continues to remain the same as more and more deliveries hit the market.,CommercialRealEstate,d5k0lnl,2,t5_2r1bz
8620628,0,t3_4xupu7,I worked in commercial real estate brokerage for  years in Toronto and now manage the leasing for a  Billion real estate portfolio. Its an absolutely amazing industry imo and you really have an opportunity to get out of it what you put in. That being said getting started is a huge challenge for most people and the attrition rate in the first  years is very high. Expect to work very hard. Your success will also be largely influenced by the team you work in and the person or people mentoring you. The knowledge required to operate in this industry takes years and years to acquire and the relationships take even longer to nurture and develop. Expect to start off pounding the pavement you will need to literally dial for dollars calling businesses landlords and investors all day every day. The monotony of coldcalling might get broken up by the occasional market study or showing but the end goal is to establish your own relationships and build your own book of business. Once you breakin life gets somewhat easier and your options for movement within the industry expand considerably. Keep in mind it is a fiercely competitive industry dominated by white alpha males although this is changing.

On the small side it would be anywhere from  to  but if you start looking at a lot of them you start to see a difference pricing and investment quality per unit.

9409059,0,t3_59fwjr,Loopnet is not for big assets anyway. It is one step above Craigslist in my opinion good for strip retail but not like you are going to sell a skyscraper with it. Sounds like you have a pocket listing. I would see why the seller does not want to list it on an MLS it could be that there are other serious issues with ownership or maybe he does not want to freak out the tenant or maybe he already has it listed on Loopnet and is trying to screw you out of a deal. As any pocket listing you shop it around to your preferred buyers and try to do an off market deal. ,CommercialRealEstate,d98nx5d,5,t5_2r1bz

In a general sense they have a lot to gain by talking to market participants and understanding their motivations. More practically if youre looking to acquire youll probably need financing and youll probably need an appraisal. So its not totally altruistic.Established appraisers are good liaisons. They talk to brokers lenders asset managers and developers regularly to understand the market. Those relationships really are the essence of the trade so youd be hardpressed to find a good one that wouldnt be willing to shoot the shit with you in exchange for being top of my mind come lending time.,CommercialRealEstate,dgc48lk,1,t5_2r1bz
