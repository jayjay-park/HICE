6694410,0,t1_cykr94w,Dont worry! UAF will never have a high graduation rate because of the open acceptance policy. Everyone who takes a class or two and doesnt go on to get a degree will lower the completion rate as will folks who take  years to get their degree. Most of these people are community members who wouldnt go to school at all if UAF were more of a traditional school with stricter regulations on who can take classes.,UAF,d0brdjp,2,t5_2tc4i
