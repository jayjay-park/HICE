6134726,0,t1_cymq8nq,Okay but do I really have to eject the pod every single time I make one? Whats the worst that could happen? Bad tasting espresso?,nespresso,cymycjr,1,t5_2tgfg
6256420,0,t3_418xfr,Given the price of their shipping and the requirement to buy in  capsule lots for an order if they dont replace them their customer service isnt worth a damn.It happened to my sisters order once they replaced them but then made her buy two more sleeves to get up to the  capsule requirement.. I was less than impressed with that. ,nespresso,cz0sbr7,2,t5_2tgfg
6768456,0,t3_48g73d,I dont get the point of this? It basically adds a timer...the point of timers on normal coffee makers is due to them taking several minutes to brew and then the hotplate keeps the coffee warm. This just spits out a shot and lets it get cold.,nespresso,d0jhgnt,2,t5_2tgfg
6812269,0,t3_48tx1v,I posted this a few months ago at singleserve. Might still be available!Sur La Table Idaho has a brand new unit on their discount rack. Beautiful red no box no capsule sampler. Clerk I spoke to said yes they can ship the unit but securely packing it without the original box will probably add to the cost. Retail is about  so half price.

10805687,0,t3_5ugl8r,I am a Moleskine fan from way back. I have at least  in various sizes. The Nespresso edition is a nice notebook nothing special except for the Nespresso logotype embossed on the cover and a picture of a bunch of capsules on the first few pages. The artists studio created a fun animated film depicting the history of Nespresso. You can find a link below just scroll down a few weeks worth of posts. This special limited edition Moleskine notebook was available for just two or three days in the States only. You had to be paying very close attention to the Nespresso website. The offer did not show up in the Nespresso phone app or on Facebook. The offer expired quickly and Nespresso is not selling them as an accessory mores the pityId buy two or three. The notebook seems to be leftover swag from a convention booth or other coffee marketing event. That is its not available at the Moleskine store. That means it was a custom job. Moleskine has a terrible reputation among fountain pen users for using really lousy paper in their products but if you are using pencils gel pens rollerballs or ballpoints you will enjoy any Moleskine notebook. I was very lucky to have acquired one. ,nespresso,dduj408,2,t5_2tgfg
11197510,0,t3_5zqn7m,I am rather OCD with my former Keurig and with my current Nespresso Inissia.  The water reservoir bothers me the most. I dont know why I smell mildew but I do.  Maybe my nose is just attune to that odor.On both machines I remove the reservoir clean it and replace the water daily. The Keurig I used and replaced the charcoal filters religiously.  Prior to brewing an espresso with the Inissia I will run two water only ml lungo with fresh Britta water and then brew an espresso.  After I am done I will run another ml through it of fresh water remove the reservoir and leave the chamber open. I will also tilt the machine to remove any excess water and let it air dry.  I have never run vinegar through my Inissia since October  and it works the same as it did the day I bought it.   But... It does leak a little as I have complained before in this subreddit.  Edit my Keurig has been in the back of cabinet since I changed to Nespressos Inissia. I no longer drink coffee at home only espresso.   ,nespresso,df18308,1,t5_2tgfg
11201987,0,t1_df069ti,There are one or two outfits selling top foil seals for used Vertuo capsules. See amazon I think or keep scrolling this reddit for a post from about December. ,nespresso,df1qbnn,1,t5_2tgfg
11227992,0,t1_df4ntzk,This is likely very true. I suspect that its more likely that since most of their states are roughly the same size as our countries they see Europe is to the USA as France is to Texas. Where as technically UK is to USA as Texas is to Wales or really Devon a county in England. But the sizing is so drastically different. ,nespresso,df4of98,1,t5_2tgfg
11512721,0,t3_61zzym,Any nespresso machine run without a capsule in the compartment will produce hot water. Though its quicker and possibly cheaper to just boil a kettle. ,nespresso,dg0yvum,2,t5_2tgfg
