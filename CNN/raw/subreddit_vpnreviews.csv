7200541,0,t1_d1whi4n,I was naturally sceptical of them as I am with all VPNs. All I can say is Ive had no major issues fast speed efficient service. From what Ive read they have addressed the logging issues. Although they could be more transparent over it since there still seems to be some confusion. The service might actually be good for most of the people recommending it and not some shilling exercise. I found its extremely difficult to find a service which ticks every box perfectly. Just have to research as much as possible and find out what is best.,vpnreviews,d1wn6kw,2,t5_2ykk2
7218906,0,t1_d1yoaet,You should try to evaluate a product on the factual information not feelings yours or someone elses. Saying that a product gives you an off feeling is not helpful there is really no wrong or right way to feel about a product its really up to you how you feel about it but that is not helpful to anyone else.I wasnt trying to defend anyone or attack anyone. I simply wanted to find out what your issue was since you were being very vague talking about feelings and being vague about what you thought AirVPN is vague on. Thats all.Ive heard this call for proof of no login before. It boggles the mind. How can you prove it? What can be the proof that a VPN does not log?I dont think you understand the concept of a security hole. Any application protocol etc. etc. can potentially be compromised the fact that a compromised system can reveal information is not a security hole. If something has been compromised the game is up. If AirVPN or any VPN is compromised all your information can potentially be accesses. What youre saying is the same as saying that all operating systems that everyone uses are huge security holes because ifwhen they are compromised unauthorized access can be gained to the information contained in them.I think that AirVPN discloses their OpenVPN configuration no what about it would you like to be disclosed? The noip logs etc. from Cryptostorm is interesting Ive read about it and its a neat idea but I think it gives people that dont understand it a false sense of securityanonymity. Its basically a token system where one identifying elementthe ip is substituted for another. So your IP is known to Cryptostorm. This makes little difference from the perspective of surveillance and identification. If you can be tied to an identifying element it matters little if its your ip or the token assigned for that ip as soon as a link can be made you have been discovered and the game is up.,vpnreviews,d1yqfrt,0,t5_2ykk2
7221590,0,t1_d1ymcde,It doesnt level the playing field because like superamazingvpn.com made up site of course for example lists the best VPN companies near thee top of the list so happens to be the ones that pay the most? Also if there were any honest VPNs they will not pay for a glowing review so they wont even be mentioned?  As for individuals with their referrel link there is greater chance that someone clicks on the referral link and signs up if they give a good review vs and honest review.  The more negatives you list the more people are going to turn away and the more people that turn away the less the compensation.  I cant trust a review with an affiliates link it is biased the fact that they receive compensation makes them untrustworthy because of the ulterior motive behind writing the review. Same with any review site that list PIA in the  position I already know its biased.,vpnreviews,d1z1g54,3,t5_2ykk2
