11329962,0,t1_dffn28c,Yeah it will unsubscribe from all email. But if youd like to receive only promotion just select to opt in to some courses. The problem is when opt out of some courses and subscribe to some other courses I end up receiving email from ALL courses. So I chose to unsubscribe all. And for the promotion Udemy have been running discount promo from time to time. So mostly I wont miss anything. Just try searching for Udemy coupon  ,Udemy,dfg8dgg,1,t5_2xros
