So if pixelsperrow gt lenpixels there would be no output at all since the whole sequence is a remainder.This can be fixed by using itertools.ziplongest instead of the builtin zip of course you need to figure out what dummy pixel fillvalue you want to use to fill out the rest of the last row. ,learnpython,cejd36i,1,t5_2r8ot

88300,0,t1_ceogey4,You use English as an example.  The irony is that English is an eclectic language.  It has grown by borrowing from every other language.  We have various English dialects and we have people who speak English with a foreign accent  yet we manage to understand one another.  Banning foreign styles from Python is a bit like banning foreign words from English and limiting our speech to the pure AngloSaxon.  There is something vaguely fascistic about this compulsion to reduce and homogenize and eradicate diversity.  Im afraid that you are overstating and belaboring the obvious so your comment itself can be seen as a form of cargoculting!  Seriously I feel like I am being beaten to a pulp by StylePolice or by OverZealousReligiousFanatics.  How many times do we have to hear the same message?   Conform!   ConformConformConform!   DeviantsWillFaceBanishment! WeMustThinkAlike! NoVariationCanBeTolerated!  A program is an artistic creation not a mass production.  When we dictate style to the artist we take the joy out of programming.  The program should be judged by clarity and the structure of the names not by the superficial style.  I prefer a program with concise unique names whatever the style to a program where ridiculously long names are used as a substitute for documentation.  And I like names where prefixes are used to reflect object structure.If you were designing a parts inventory database how would you identify the parts?  Which of the following two part names makes more sense?     TwoInchwoodscrewwithflatheadandtenthreadsperinch     WFlObviously the second name is preferable.  And yet it is the first name that is deemed GoodPython in your convention and use of the second name would be Unthinkable.Back when I learned programming there were two languages  COBOL and Assembly Language.  The COBOL people used the long names to impress the managers who secretly hated computers and the assembly language people like me used encoded character names.  Unfortunately the COBOL gang prevailed and programs today look more like literature than code.  The long names create a misleading illusion of transparency while hiding details Because you understand the name you think you understand the program.  ,learnpython,ceohcv1,2,t5_2r8ot

104028,0,t3_1va3s1,This is what Ive been doing and it seems to be working for me.First get familiar with it take a few hours and do the learn python the hard way exercises. They get you accustomed to the basics of the language and programming in general.Second I began looking at things that I wanted to do on my computers servers that I could script. Even things that are easily done with other programs I began writing scripts to do them. This has taught me a lot and being that its exercises that I am putting on myself it is more interesting and real world feeling. If I wanted something that would check to see if my servers were up and running every few minutes I made a script to do that. Then I altered that script to email me and notify me if one was down then I altered that script to specify what server is not responding properly. In doing this I would also create smaller scripts that would do things like create a directory full of empty files that I would use to test my main script against. Basically anything that you do on a repetitive basis can be scripted within reason.  This way you set your own goals and build off of what you know you can accomplish and learn more in the process.I am far from a developer and I am still very much a novice but by doing this I now know leaps and bounds more than what I knew before I started. The last thing to remember is to set your goals to where they are within reach. Dont start off thinking you are going to build a new game or develop something that will change the face of computing right from the start. Even things that seem very mundane can be daunting to code when you are trying to learn. Start small for example write one that takes a text file full of words and writes it to another text file simple copy and paste. Stuff like that is where you start then move on to bigger and more complex things.Good luck!,learnpython,ceq9wr3,2,t5_2r8ot

410006,0,t1_cfn169v,gt fully denormalizing this means you arent storing a complete thing in a single row. The complete thing here is a shift with an in time and an out time.If you define thing as a shift then its impossible to store a complete thing as a single row because at any given point in time a shift is not yet complete.  Therefore you shouldnt define thing as a shift but an event because you can store that in a row.gt If there isnt one add a row with a null start time.That creates a race condition because you have to first do the update query and if it fails do an insert query.  In this particular example it probably wont matter but its not using the database properly if you have race conditions.gt even if you stored events in separate rows you would still need a table that storesNo you dont.

They are both part of the same construct.  The second one is two independent if statements unrelated to one another.  Either one or both or neither could end up executing.Run this code to see the difference    x      y      z      if x          print x is         elif y          print y is     elif z          print z is Then run this code    x      y      z      if x          print x is         if y          print y is     if z          print z is See if you can guess what each one will print before it runs.,learnpython,cghwn7e,2,t5_2r8ot

735848,0,t1_cgnwnrh,Even using crypto can be difficult. PyCrypto has a bunch of cryptographic primitives that you can use to construct systems but if you dont understand how they work you will write vulnerable code. For the most part you dont actually want to use crypto directly. Depending on what youre developing if youre lucky that should be abstracted away so you never see it. If you actually ever need crypto for production code consult a security professional. If you would just like to play PyCrypto and you could also explore ctypes wrrappers around NaCl Of course ctypes stuff brings its own problems that you need to fully understand in order to use it in production. pyOpenssl is another thing you can check out. Its a python interface to openssl. With all of this code I cannot stress enough do not use custom crypto code in production without consulting a security professional. Im hoping that in the next few years I can suggest a simple library that allows anyone to safely encrypt and decrypt without really understanding the internals but that doesnt exist right now. ,learnpython,cgnx4dr,3,t5_2r8ot

When BeautifulSoup does not have a builtin property you request it calls its find method on the requested property instead. So calling soup.div returns the first div element of the page. Its possible this is creating a silent bug in your code if your version of BeautifulSoup simply lacks the required methods?Also check whether youre receiving any data with your request you might be getting an error page which lacks anything with the jstweet class?Also to other posters BeautifulSoup  at least is clever in its traversal of HTML and searching for a class will return any object with that class even if the class string is full of other classes.

1704270,0,t1_cjtrf5f,Python  automatically encodes and decodes things using ASCII when it needs to. Python  does not so you have to do it explicitly. The problem is most people dont realize that those automatic conversions are happening in their code until someone throws some nonASCII data at it and then things start to blow up with cryptic errors. I say cryptic because in Python  you can call .encode on a string and get a UnicodeDecodeError. This happens because Python first has to decode your string to a unicode object before it can encode it to something else and that automatic decoding is done with ASCII.So the same amount of encodingdecoding happens in Python  but you have to do it explicitly. This is arguably good because it forces programmers to understand where the potential problem spots are when they are handling differentlyencoded text sources. It also means youll never call encode and confusingly get a DecodeError. On the other hand if you work on code that only has to deal with ASCII then yes this extra work is annoying.In general it has been my experience that people who have a really good understanding of Unicode and character sets are more positive toward the changes in Python .,learnpython,cjtzh65,1,t5_2r8ot

The fact that you want these to be in separate files has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not they must be classes or functions.  Python is not Java. Looking at your code they should simply be functions.  mainTarget and mainPursuer are functions not method of classes since they are not invoked with at least one argument self.  You never use the only one instance attribute that you define in each class.   when you change the name of a local variable say from behaviour to behaviourPursuer you do not change what the code does.  Looking at your two classes they do exactly the same thing.Lets assume you fix things so that you have two effectively different functions yes they should be functions.  To compare the output you should return the string that would be the output from each.  Then if you want to see if the output is identical youd do a comparison    if mainTarget  mainPursuer        printThey are identical.    else        printThey are different.,learnpython,cmjsbuv,1,t5_2r8ot

The next line that is not indented is interpreted separately and the previous line is the last line of the function.A return statement is used to both end a functions execution immediately and return some value back to whatever called that function. For instance if your function ended with return True return  or return Hello World! you could assign the output of that function to a variable like so    output  functionnameNote when I say end a functions execution immediately I mean that all other code in the function is skipped when a return statement is executed.

3171593,0,t3_2wgv9z,gt a userdefined typeTo use instances of userdefined classes as keys in a dictionary they must implement both eq and hash and in such a way that two instances that compare equal always have the same hash. Two instances with the same hash need not but should in most cases compare equal. Most importantly the hash value must not change so long as the instance is used as a key and instances that were equal when inserted into the dictionary must keep being equal at least until theyre no longer used as keys. The same goes for keys that compare unequal.The easiest way to achieve this is to create a third method that returns a tuple of immutables strings tuples floats ints frozensets etc. where the items are the attributes of that instance which gives the instance its identity in your case this would be the tuple self.id self.type it seems. Then the eq method can compare the tuples of self and other and the hash method can simply return hashidentitytuple.EDIT It is of course then important not to modify those attributes that make up the identity while the instance is used as a dictionary key. Simply remembering to leave those attributes alone works but for bigger projects and published modules you would maybe want to put in some security measures to help the users avoid shooting themselves in the foot. There are many ways of achieving immutability but most of them is burdened with gotchas. The maybe easiest and best way is to hide the attributes in question behind a readonly property like this    class WithProtectedAttributesobject        def initself identity            self.identity  identity        property        def identityself             This is a property to prevent anyone from accidently             modifying this value since it should never be changed.            return self.identityThis prevents accidental modification of the identity attribute but does not introduce any of the problems that approaches like inheriting from tuple or extending setattr introduces and unlike using descriptors its easy even for newbies to read the code and understand whats happening at least once theyve been introduced to the property decorator.,learnpython,coqqfns,2,t5_2r8ot

You could input string for example and write line by line.Reading and writing files isnt a proper way to store everything its very basic and might even get hectic because you need to make sure you dont open it  times in different states then save it other wise it will over write its self.But in basic what your computer is doing when you someFile  openmyFile.txtw is it opens up a file then w means to write to it you can also do r to read only or r read and write i think... been a whileSo to write to a file youd do something like someFile.writethis will be in the file then youd do someFile.close to save the changes.Some games and programs a lot of them actually use things like SQL. SQL is a language in of its self its only purpose is to manage data its a data base tool you dont need to understand everything about it but its built into python it works like the open method but its much more professional one of the best database tools out there really..... but again it all depends what you want to do. the main way to use it is by sending commands to SQL in strings youll notice but it still stores it all into a files or memory for SQL lite... but you wont be keeping your data after your program goes out of memorySometimes you best option might be to store it in xml so people can read it... and maybe another program that will access it will have to use it normally files are.... stored in xml when you want that to happen.... like mods for games store there settings that the user can change in xml so that the user can modify it if needed manually.Some games even store all of there data to bite code ones and zeros so players cant do anything with it. or they store a compiled file of some sort But thats another subject.The main principal to storing data is to save it to the hard driver into a file that all ready exists.

3617232,0,t3_31smvp,. You will need to know how to read lines in a text file. Check the docs Python version for more details.. As you read the file youll be taking input one line at a time. Learn how to read a file line by line and work on each line separately. Scrolling down in the above links you see that you can loop over lines in a file very simply        for line in f  where f stores the file object you opened             ... do stuff with the line. You know that the id line starts with the symbol gt and all lines following it are your input. Create a simple file with different types of lines in it some with gt at the start and some without then write a chunk of code that is able to read this file and just output whether it hit that symbol or now. A simple yes! when it hits or nope when it doesnt for each line.. Once you know  works you are ready to read input from these FASTA files. Now the trick becomes how to interpret it.Consider this snip of code which is somewhat unrelated but illustrates a point    sum      for i in range        sum  i    printsum    gtgt Note the range stops at  but i will never equal Here a variable is set that stores a certain value and is altered at each step in the for loop. This running total is useful when iterating over a set of objects and combining pieces of them into a larger whole. For instance if what you were iterating through were dictionaries you could sum the totals of a particular index in each one. There are methods that make that particular example much simpler and dont use for loops at all but thats not necessary here.Thus what you want to do is run line by line through the file adding the contents of one line to a running total of those lines. So long as you can identify that the next line youre about to run isnt a new id line  remember check for the gt character  you can keep adding lines together.Finally assuming this file will have multiple ids to be stored one of the easiest ways to store them all without knowing how many youll have is a dictionary    dict          id ATCGGATGA        id ATCGTAGCTA         ...    A dictionary can be initialized with nothing in it and then each time you assign something to one of its indices that index is created on the spot    dict      dictid      dictid  ATCGT    dictid  TCGA     etc.Put all this together and work piece by piece through the code testing different chunks of that code as you go and youll end up with a working solution.,learnpython,cq4l9je,2,t5_2r8ot

This function or maybe more accurately this procedures job is to print some stuff to the screen.  It doesnt need to return anything and likewise youre not really expecting it to return anything because you dont assigned it to anything. If you wanted it to return something you could call it with something like magicvariable  welcome.On line  you expect the userInput function to return to you something.  Your function runs and the return statement on line  is now assigned to the variable named age.On line  you again expect your function calculateage to return something.  Function executes and the line  return statement gets assigned to variable named y.On line  you call a procedure that is really just printing something to screen again.

4105322,0,t3_37mnoo,Git keeps track of files as they change. You can use it for any kind of files but it was created to keep track of source code files like a Python script. it was created by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernels source code.With Git when you want to save your work you make a commit. This saves exactly what you changed since the last commit along with your name email address the time and a unique identifier for the commit. As a git project is worked on over time it becomes a story of every code change that happened to your project in basically the order that the changes were made. A very simple git repo would be just this not just saved files but a record of how those files changed over time.One use case is Python project you are working on You have a record of everything youve done and you can snapshot and branch off at any point. So you can work on the master branch and get the project working create a feature branch and build this other functionality without affecting work youre doing in master and once you get it right you can merge the two together. Or checkout a crazyidea branch and do something nuts just to see what happens and delete it when it breaks everything. All of this is safe and you will never ever lose any work if you use Git correctly.Another use case is system config files. You can use a git repo as a record of any and all changes to those config files so that when a change you make breaks something you can easily go back in time and see what exactly changed and who changed it and roll it back if you want.You can also save your git repository to a server and thats where it gets really fun. Other people can clone your repo work on it themselves and push the changes back to you. Git is super smart! It can take several changes from a bunch of different people and merge them together into the same code branch which means that lots and lots of people can contribute to a project without a bunch of extra work trying to get their changes to play nice together.Github is a git server with social networking and extra stuff. It gives you the web interface to browse through the source code in your browser thats what you linked to. It keeps track of what projects youve worked on etc etc.,learnpython,cro8c77,1,t5_2r8ot

Sure dictionaries are available but learning a language whether programmatic or spoken requires drilling certain idiomatic principles so that you learn how parts of the language work. Copypastaing code into a lesson youre working on is similar to copying your neighbors homework or test. Sure you get the answer right but you dont get the practice and contextual lesson that the answer brings you.Alternatively your ability to import a module implies that you have enough of the basics down to be able to create an application thatll use the modules functionality sufficiently. And as ustebrepar mentioned modules are selfcontained amp provide endpoints that allow you to use the functionality or data provided by the module. Ultimately it should function like a little factory data in other data out. Youre welcome to tour the factory floor but the understanding is that the module will just work. tldr Handcode things while learning to get practice with the basics.

Use a different name in that case even if it is within a small scope.The cause of it giving you the last elements only is because youre assigning values to result over and over which overwrites it completely. The only result that will stick will be the last one.Consider the following    a      a      a      a  Each time you assign a value to a you overwrite the value that was stored there before. The end result of this is a  .To keep a running list with a traditional for loop typically youd use .append which adds to the end of the list    a      a.append    a.append    a.append    a.appendNow a will be the list    . So in general use append not a straight assignment.Warning just replacing the current code with .append might cause an infinite loop and crash your machine.

This is the assumption...Imagine a list of words x y z. If x is an article the and y is an adjective great then it is highly likely that z is a noun  the great working doesnt make much sense. The great man a lot more. Using x y to predict z is a bigram two words approach to word prediction but you can experiment with larger ngrams  using more words to predict the next word. Larger ngrams arguably say more about the grammatical structure at the cost of processing power. The trained algorithm can now select the most probable wordclass to follow the preceding n words. Its just a matter of selecting a word from the partofspeech category that rhymes if Im catching your drift.

4717040,0,t3_3fj33v,gt Im finding in python that I always need to prefill the array with an amount that I think Ill need which is slightly troublesome. Is this actually the case or am I doing something wrong?You can use Python lists in much the same way that you can use JS arrays  list comprehensions are a handy way to construct them but you dont have to use them    gtgtgt x      gtgtgt x.append    gtgtgt x         gt Can I just send the whole object doc as an argument and a return or is that bad practice for some reason?You should basically use a method  as long as youre manipulating the object you should put the code in a method  it shows your intent better since the operation prepcolortable conceptually blongs to the ActiveDocument.    class ActiveDocument        ...        def prepcolortableself            allreds  np.arrayself.colorsaslist            for i in rangeself.uniqueclrcount                self.colorsrgbi.rgbr  allredsi    doc  ActiveDocument    doc.prepcolortablegtAlso when im defining the class ActiveDocument  see that pastebin above do I need to be pre stating what all of the variables are like I am? Im putting in null for a lot of them or zeros because I dont actually know what theyre going to be yet. Is this bad practice? I kind of like having a list of what could ever be added to that object but I could just as well do that with commented out code. In Python there are two different scopes at play with classes  instance scope which is what you can manipulate using self for example andclass scope.Consider the following    class Class        x          y          def initself            self.y              self.z   Class.x refers to the class variable x. If youre familiar with a language like Java consider Class.x as a static value on Class classes are objects so you can freely add and read properties from them. You can also access x via self.x as long as there isnt an instance variable called x  I can explain this more in depth if you want I dont have long right now. Class.y is also a class variable but self.y is an instance variable. self.y shadows Class.y so self.y   but Class.y   self.z is an instance variable. Class.z gives you an error.For this reason you should typically assign all the variables you care about inside of init since you dont want to pollute the class with unset variables.Ill be back on a bit later if youd like some elaboration  I have a TF game to get to. ,learnpython,ctp4dov,1,t5_2r8ot

5236341,0,t1_cvh5oyp,So to understand the specification...You must find all words in a given wordlist that consists only of letters in a given string. Missing letters are okay but you are not allowed to use more than one letter per letter in the input string. For example if your input is fod you arent allowed to make foo as that uses more os than were given.Okay seems simple enough. One way of doing it would be to simply count each letter in the input string then iterate over every word in the wordlist. If the input string has more than or equal to amount of every letter in the word then that is a valid answer.To build it in python I have always used a dictionary using each individual letter as a key. Write a function that can return a dict with the format letter count then run that on your input word. Then for every word in your wordlist run the function again and iterate over every key. Add it to a valid word list if the input word has enough letters to build the output word.,learnpython,cvh63oc,1,t5_2r8ot

5322896,0,t1_cvs0lm3,I kinda get that.  I suppose my confusion stems from understanding what exactly it is that the computer is programmed to do and understand based on this situation.  By this I mean that when the for loop is typed the computer is programmed to recognize the nd word in the line as the variable assuming it is not a string and say okay.  This is the variable theyve chosen.  Now I will associate this variable with this list of data.I believe this only applies within the for loop itself as well.  For example if I went outside of the loop and told it to print number it would return an error because I did not tell it to print a string or a number and it does not continue to recognize the variable as being attached to that list.To do that I would have to permanently assign that variable to the list outside of a for loop and then not reassign it to anything else later on.Apologies if this seems like rambling or a bit much.

5386834,0,t1_cw06idk,Absolutely not. LPTHW was the first resource I ever learned from I had zero programming experience prior to that. When I said patronising I was referring to Zeds tendency to imply that if you find his resource difficult to work from its probably because you arent cut out for programming. The reality is a lot of people have difficulty with it because its a shoddily compiled document.Truth tables are more useful for people who are intending to go into a technical area rather than vice versa. Booleans and comparison operators work pretty intuitively memorising truth tables is just unnecessary grinding for a beginner. If LPTHW said here is some tables you can refer to if you get confused that would be great but memorizing? Nah.The fact that you learned programming perfectly well from LPTHW does not mean it is a good resource. I can get to the shops near my house by rolling along the ground that doesnt mean that method is as good as walking for the purpose.Make no mistake I wouldnt recommend Codecademy in most cases either. I dont think the morselsized exercises are great for embedding knowledge into a persons brain and having your code run via the browser does not set one up well for writing and running scripts locally etc.But there are tons of other totalbeginner resources around now which are objectively way better than LPTHW. programarcadegames.com Automate The Boring Stuff Udacity etc. Pick any you find at random and the chances of it being more poorly organised dated and inscrutable than LPTHW are very slim. I have yet to find one.This is not just my opinion. Browse this post and others and youll see that recommendations for LPTHW are generally downvoted.

Dont worry about it if your ideas arent super unique your goal should be to get used to the flow of syntax.in the python interpreter you should typeimport thisbefore you begin each day just to let the mantra soak in.Once youve written some basic scripts or small apps post them to github or somewhere and share them back to places like this asking for peoples input.As you start to get more comfortable with the natural structure of the language start to focus on making your solutions more pythonic. Which is to say by this point you should have read import this a couple dozen times and you should be thinking in those patterns.Also there is a great talk by Raymond Hettinger called Beyond PEP which takes a lot of Java examples and shows what a more pythonic solution looks like.  ,learnpython,cwi9b9o,12,t5_2r8ot

5642670,0,t1_cwwbo01,Ill copypasta from a post belowThis is for deployment of some digital signage machines that will occasionally double as user workstations. The idea is that by default they autologin to a predefined user and run the digital signage application as they should. However should a user be inclined to use the machine as a workstation they simply logoff the signage and login as themselves.My goal is to after the user has logged off as themselves to restart the machine after a certain amount of time just in case another use wants to log in or users are switching and to check to make sure nobody is logged in before automatically rebooting and thusly returning back to being digital signage.Of course I can remind users to just restart the machine after they are done using it in order to get the machine to return to being signage...but users forget. The script is a sort of user error checking in that it will wait for a bit then restart automatically unless a user logs back in.Python is the language I am most familiar with and it is already deployed across all the machines we have where I work so making a logoff script in Python is extremely easy to deploy via group policy. I just need to make sure said script waits x amount of time after a log off checks to see if a user is logged in because otherwise somebody could log in during the x time window and then be forced off accidentally and then force a reboot.The force reboot function already is working and so is the timer so its just in my mind a matter of figuring out a way to check if there is a current user logged in or not after the timer function and then if there isnt executing the force reboot function.,learnpython,cwwj06o,1,t5_2r8ot

You likely need to use classes if you are going to have more than one instances of that class.  If not you are likely overcomplicating things by using classes.  Python is not Java.. If each instance has different attributes parameters yes you should include them in your constructor.  Python does not really have a constructor like you have in Java or C ... although for most practical purpose Pythons init method can be thought of as a constructor..

Your question is really how do I communicate information out of a function and then use that information elsewhere?The first part is accomplished by using return which you already know how to do.The second part is accomplished by actually using the returned value in turn you do this by treating the call to the function as part of an expression. In the same way that  given that x is equal to  and y is equal to  you can write x  y and derive  given that x returns  and y returns  you can write x  y and derive . Alternately you could assign the individual results to variables or use them for further calls etc.Please study the example carefully    def computesomethinga b        return a    b        def main        x          y          printwhen I compute something with  and  I get ..formatx y computesomethingx y,learnpython,cz8tzsc,5,t5_2r8ot

6666242,0,t1_d08rmdm,Ahhhhh. Okay I totally see the error in my logic and it involves how the local and web data were compared. Let me see if I can explain what youve shown meI mistakenly thought replacing the local data automatically meant the web data would be overridden and would reset isposted which I was trying to avoid. But this led me to originally write the loops from within the file and that sent me down the incorrect path trying to debug errors that I was creating for myself. And I looped and conditionaled myself into knots. Also this is bad practice generally because Im leaving the file open for so long as you point out.So rather than compare the data sets and delete the duplicates from the web data if the key is in the web data... I flip it around. If the key is not in the data from the json file then add a new key in localdata that copies the info from the json file.This frees me up to only do one json.dump because no matter what the data is or how many times its been scraped the file is always rewritten with a mix of new and old data that has been put into the localdata dictionary.Am I breaking this down accurately?As for the daywrapper class I did test that last night.

6955556,0,t1_d14mt4h,Keys need to be hashable.  Thats subtly different than needing to be immutable.  Its possible to create a type thats both hashable and mutable and it would work fine as a key although youd have to think really hard about equality semantics to make it work logically.  An example is an object that maintains an internal cache to speed up expensive lookups of some immutable large object.  Such an object is mutable but the parts that change dont matter for the purposes of equality.When it comes to tuples they are always immutable but theyre not necessarily always hashable.  A tuple is only hashable if all its members are hashable so not all tuples are valid dict keys.  You can view this as saying that a dict key has to be recursively immutable not just immutable at the outer layer but that still conflates immutability and hashability.,learnpython,d14quts,3,t5_2r8ot

You can read any file this way.But what do you want to actually do with the resulting string of bytes?  If you want to decompress the image into raw pixels you will either need to look up the specification for the JPEG file format and write a parser or use an existing module such as Pillow that implements that for you.  But maybe you dont want to do that.  Maybe you want to send the file over a network connection e.g. upload it to a website or something along those lines.  You dont need to parse the file to do that because that dont require specific knowledge of the JPEG file format.,learnpython,d161mye,9,t5_2r8ot
6969309,0,t3_4b5nml,First no reason to have this code as a class. It has no real purpose as one so lets drop that complexity and make it into a function called main        from future import printfunction    import bs    import requests            def main        Main execution block    if name  main        mainThis is more appropriate for your code as it stands. Lets also drop re since BeautifulSoup is superpowered. So unless we really need it lets leave it off.Now the next bit is we want to identify what we want to do in psuedocode    def main        Main execution block         Request Page         Send source to Soup         Look for JPEGs         Build a list and give it to the user in a human readable formWe have those first two steps right from your class initialization. Lets use that.        def main        Main execution block         Request Page        r  requests.get         Send source to Soup        soup  bs.BeautifulSoupr.text html.parser         ...Now I know we want JPEGs from the body but the issue is that we have them all over! Those strings are just everywhere so lets limit that search for now and we can expand it later. Lets say only img tags that are jpgs.So you want to look at Soups docs at this point and read up on selecting what you want. findAll has a powerful set of selectors and we can roll them into any usage we need.So lets select images with the class .badgeitemimg and grab the source attribute.     ...     Look for JPEGs    jpgs  soup.findallimg classbadgeitemimg     ...Lets improve that with a list comprehension and just get the src. This takes care of our last two comments.     Look for JPEGs     Build a list    images  img.getsrc for img in soup.findallimg classbadgeitemimgSo lastely we need to make this print nicely for the user. Simply join the list of jpgs via a n.        from future import printfunction    import bs    import requests        def main        Main execution block         Request Page        r  requests.get         Send source to Soup        soup  bs.BeautifulSoupr.text html.parser         Look for JPEGs         Build a list        images  img.getsrc for img in soup.findallimg classbadgeitemimg         and give it to the user in a human readable form        printn.joinimages        if name  main        main,learnpython,d16b33i,3,t5_2r8ot

Make up a set like this    gtgtgt set  CardAerodactyl Holo  Fossil    ... CardArticuno Holo  Fossil    ... CardMuk Rare  Fossil    ... CardMagmar Uncommon  FossilThen you can use the information in the classes to organise them. So when you want the holo selection from the set    selectionrare  card.name for card in deck if card.rarity  Holo    selectionrare    Aerodactyl ArticunoIf you add more cards to the set then you dont need to do anything to get them to appear in the correct selection. note youd select the card in the list comprehension rather than the card.name.I would use another list to represent the cards in the pack.    cardslots      for i in range        cardslots.appendrandom.choiceselectioncommon    for i in range        cardslots.appendrandom.choiceselectionuncommon    cardslots.appendrandom.choiceselectionrareThen declarecardname can accept a list and loop through it to print everything.    for a in cardslots        printYou pulled a   a.name     a.rarity     a.number   from   a.expansion  .And your reset function thats giving you trouble can be completely ditched and calls to it replaced with    cardslots  ,learnpython,d2ftdum,1,t5_2r8ot

When you mutate one you mutate the other. Thats probably not the behavior you were going for.Edit This is not necessarily true of integers as uschoolmonkey pointed out.Consider leveraging for loops. Such as for char in availablechars will iterate over each character in that string. This will help you avoid clumsy use of indexes. If you need to refer to the index you can use enumerate to get the index as well for index character in enumerateavailablecharsIn general you want to sanitize your inputs. Never trust user input and a bad input should not crash your program. One method around this is to gather inputs in a while True loop and breaking out of the loop only once the input is satisfactory.I also had hit a bug in the program where it was stuck guessing letter passwords infinitely in the loop at line . I used the password semper with min chars of  max chars of  available characters of semperAlso theres already an existing function in Python that will try all combinations of given lists in itertools called permutationsItertools is a great module for doing operations in a loop.

Write functions that only do one thing. readthepdf converttotext parserecords filterrecord displayrecord.Write filter functions that take a whole record even if your function is only planning to read a single field. That way you can blindly apply all of the rules to a single record and you can easily extend the list of rules.Also go for optional logging in all of the filter functions if logging  True print.... So you can turn the logging on and off as you need and they all say what rules got flagged and what score they applied.Sometimes the score returned will be positive more likely spam and sometimes negative more likely notspam.

How can you split something into parts and then get nothing back? Its sort of like division. If you divide by  you arent actually splitting the dividend into multiple parts. Youre just left with the original dividend.Sure were talking about an empty string here but an empty string is not None. Its still something even though its truthiness is False. No matter how you split an empty string you wont ever get None from it. Youll only ever get the original empty string.,learnpython,d3pac8f,3,t5_2r8ot

7837361,0,t1_d3wkdh2,Well for starters I didnt learn classes by refactoring old code. I hate that. Ive got old programs that are just one big list of functions and they work just fine as they are.I finally wrapped my head around classes when the program I was working on was complex enough that it simply wouldnt work without them.There are two major bonuses to class and each one will solve a problem for you.. Classes collect functions into sets. If you dont know what classes your program should have try looking at all the functions you have and ask yourself if some are similar enough to group them together. Thats how my classes started as glorified function storage.. Classes store their own variables. If youre using a bunch of global variables in your code or even if youve got this one variable that a handful of functions use between them... using a class to store those values keeps things clean.At some point youre going to be planing out a program that needs classes and Id say dont worry until you get there. Youll start coding get frustrated that for example you need to create a price variable for every item in a store but it would be insane to create a bunch of appleprice   global variables.

Choose between choices    checkinputEnter red green or blue  red green blue    checkinputEnter   or     Your savefile method looks a bit odd and you have some repeated code in there. You could just pickle.dumpself file but read the discussion here or create a dict and pickle that then you dont need  separate files. To load it you still have update the attributes separately or update the complete dict of the object. Also get used to open files with the with statement     with opendata.pickle rb as f         data  pickle.loadfYour lines could be shorter. Having to scroll horizontally is really annoying and shorter lines are usually better for readability. Pycharms default is  chars which is too much in my opinion.

That would mean you dont care about remembering previous position in order to fix it.you could make it scalable eg x x but now that means that your human readable topleft etc start losing meaning. Standard d format xy is a safe choice because it doesnt care about size and the operation of moving is all about addingsubstracting .    x y  position    if ch  w        position  x y    elif ch  s        position  x y    elif ch  a        position  x y    elif ch  d        position  x y some conditions would be necessary to prevent escaping the boundaries of the board eg x   disallows xy reaching .,learnpython,d5goxpl,3,t5_2r8ot

The function arguments are things you want to come into the function from the outside. So just change your first line to def computepayhrs and the call to computepayhrs and youll be just fine.Also a function can have multiple return points so you can just write return hrs  r and return  hrs  r  hrs    o instead of assigning the result to pay and returning that at the very end.

The script only goes to the print else case if you dont enter anything otherwise it goes to line  and calls the function again. What is char? I think it is supposed to be a list of unique characters. But why would you be iterating over that at all? You can check if an element is in a list with if character in listofuniquesWhat is c? It is the user input why are you comparing if c  i? i is going to be an element of char. When implemented correctly it will be single character its not going to match the multicharacter string c.

8676616,0,t3_4ys7v2,Ok. There are a few things going on here. First is that you are calling the init of Shape where you should just be using super to call the parents init method. Both udadiaar and ugarrettarmstrong correctly pointed out the correct use of super like so    class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself w c            self.width  w            self.colour  c            superSquare self.initBut since you are using python thumbsup you can simplify this since who wants to remember the arguments of super? Is it superSquare self or superself Square?  Its a pain to remember and luckily you dont have to in python. You can simply call super with no arguments and python figures it out. So now your Square class would look like this.    class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself w c            self.width  w            self.colour  c            super.initThe second point is that the way you are using the init to method to set the number of sides is not really what it is meant for. Basically when working with classes there are two levels of variables Classlevel variables and Instancelevel variables. Classlevel variables are used for things that each instance of the class should have in common whereas Instancelevel variables are used for customizing specific instances of that class.Lets look at the variables you have defined. colour. sides. widthNow colour and width are indeed things that you want to be able to customize for each instance. Squares with different widths and colour are still squares so that seems like good choice of instance variables. However A Quadrilateral and by extension a Square can only ever have  sides. Therefore there is no need to do that setup on a per instance basis like you do with colour and width. This is what Classlevel variables are for. To use them you dont need init you can just declare them directly on the class like so    class Shape        sides          color  NoColour        def calcAreaself            return     class QuadrilateralShape        sides       class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself w c            self.width  w            self.colour  c             def calcAreaself            return Area self.width  Now you dont even need initialize the parent class since there is nothing to initialize. They are all just class level variables that you get for free.  Pretty cool eh? Making a square below shows that it all works as expected.    In  s  Square blue    In  s.calcArea    Out Area     In  s.sides    Out Note you access Classlevel variables the same way using self.attribute. Also if you override the value of that Classlevel variable for a specific instance it will only affect that specific instance. Now onto a couple other things to help clean up the rest of your code. I recommend naming your function arguments using better variable names besides w and c  width and colour are the natural choices and make your code a lot more readable.     class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself width colour            self.width  width            self.colour  colourAlso instead of having a method calcArea it seems more natural and pythonic to add another attribute area so you can just get the area directly like sq.area.    class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself width colour            self.width  width            self.colour  colour            self.area  self.width  Now you may ask Well what if I want to change the width of the square after I create it wont the area attribute still have the old area value? And you would be right. Lucky python has a sweet feature that ensures we get the correct value for area each time we call sq.area even if we change the width. Its the property decorator. You use them like so     class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself width color            self.width  width            self.color  color                property        def areaself            return self.width  And testing it out you can see that since we defined area as a method it will get calculated each time we call sq.area but adding the property decorator we can still access area as if we had set it up in the init method like before    In  s  Square blue        In  s.area    Out         In  s.width          In  s.area    Out Now the Square class is a lot more flexible because you can get the area as a number and use it how you like instead of getting back the string Area along with the number. And moreover as a python user of a Square class most people would expect to be able to lookup the area using the very natural sq.area syntax instead of calling a method to get it.String representations are useful though and luckily python has a thing for them too. Its the repr method. Basically you can take what you did in your print statement and put it in the repr method of the Square class and then its reusable. Here is an example what it would look like    class SquareQuadrilateral        def initself width colour            self.width  width            self.colour  colour                property        def areaself            return self.width          def reprself            return Squaresides width area colour.formatself.sides                                                                           self.width                                                                           self.area                                                                           self.colour Now testing this out we get    In  s  Square blue        In  prints    Squaresides width area colourblueHopefully that helped.

So     gtgtgt a      gtgtgt a  heyis valid code! So no in Python you cant require this the way you can with Option Explicit.There are some things that can still be caught statically in Python like this error here since caunt isnt used below the point its assigned to something like Pylint would helpfully complain. Many people either configure their editors to run pylint on their code automatically or use an IDE like PyCharm which has this kind of thing already configured. But these arent part of the language proper like Option Explicit is.However pretending variables have types is still a very useful thing to do. So much so that there are typecheckers for Python like mypy I would suggest not using it for a while because its not a standard thing and you might run into issues that would make learning Python more confusing.

8842750,0,t1_d7anbph,return can only be used in functions and break and continue can only be used in for and while loops. The contents of a .py file are run once and only once either by running it as a script for example by typing something like python temp.py at the command line or by importing it as a module for example with import temp somewhere in some python code  this makes variables functions and classes defined in temp.py available using the syntax temp.name where name is the name of the variable or whatever. A function is how you write code within a .py file that can be run repeatedly during the execution of the program. A very basic function looks like    def myfunction        printHello world!Then we can call this function repeatedly like so    myfunction    myfunctionFunctions can also take arguments and return things for example    def doubleitx        return   x    printdoubleit  prints     printdoubleit  prints You can put return statements inside ifs and elifs to avoid having long stretches of code in an else clause. For example    def docomplicatedstuffifnotx        if x              return        ltcomplicated stuffgt    x      docomplicatedstuffifnotxreturn by itself returns the value None and None is also returned if python reaches the end of a function without hitting a return statement.Except for short scripts you should generally aim to structure your code so that most of it is inside functions with each function having a specific job that is simple to explain. If you find the structure of your code getting confusing or you find yourself repeating sections of code you probably need to factor sections of code out into their own functions.,learnpython,d7aru7z,2,t5_2r8ot

By looping this you read  bytes every iteration. Those  bytes could be called chunks but the point is here that readsize returns one chunk and doesnt split it by itself.Edit if you want to divide the content over X chunks you need to know the filesize first divide that over X and that gives you the amount of bytes read will need to read for each chunk.,learnpython,d7noff6,3,t5_2r8ot

9119283,0,t3_556f7v,The script argument  argv line will result in an error if the user doesnt provide an argument.  Thats probably what you want but the problem is that the error is going to look like    ValueError need more than  value to unpackWhat to do in this situation is not going to be obvious to the user.  Id suggest something like this    if lensys.argv lt         print Please provide an argument!        raise SystemExit    argument  argvAlso you dont need to do    if isIntargument  FalseYou can just do    if not isIntargumentGenerally you dont want to compare directly to True or False unless theres some way for them to get mixed up with a valid falsey value e.g. zero in some cases.Finally Id separate the script into two parts  The function itself and calling the function.  This is a lot of text that doesnt immediately benefit you so feel free to skip it  The function itselfThe idea here is that you create a function that takes an integer as its argument and then draws a square of that size    def makesquarearg        modArg  arg          if arg gt             top            mid            top        elif arg              print         else            print Nice try but I cant make negative squares.Why do this?  Because once youve created a function like that you can call it from anywhere!  For example lets say you were writing another program that draws five squares of increasing size.  Without a function like this youre in for a lot of copypaste.  But if you did make a function like that and e.g. put it in a file called squaredrawer.py you could easily make the drawfivesquares program called drawfivesquares.py    from squaredrawer import makesquare        for size in xrange        makesquaresizeAnd thats it! Easily done.For simple things like this chances are good youre not going to reuse it but its a good habit to get into.  If you did that right now however itd be a bit of a problem.  Namely the squaredrawer module is still expecting to get an argument from argv but youre now passing that argument in via the function and drawfivesquares.py doesnt need an argument.  The program above will fail if you call it without an argument even though that arguments not even needed anymore.  How to fix this? Calling the functionWhen you do import squaredrawer.py everything in the script gets run meaning your initial script argument  argv or my replacement suggestion they both happen no matter what.  What you need to do is to make sure that those things only happen if youre running python squaredrawer.py .  In other words that the stuff that does the argv checking only does so if its being called directly from the command line.Fortunately theres something for that.  First remove the script argument  argv line entirely.  Once youve done that almost everything should be in a function except for argument parsing which is exactly what you want.  Youre going to be putting that argument parsing after a special if statement    if name  main        if lensys.argv lt             print Please provide an argument!            raise SystemExit        argument  argv        if not isIntargument            print Please enter a whole number            quit        makesquareintargumentPython has a special variable called name thats set to the name of the module or importantly  main if that specific script is called directly from the command line.  If youre doing a from squaredrawer import makesquare it wont be set to main and so its not going to be trying to look for an argument that doesnt exist.Hope that helped!,learnpython,d87zn2x,2,t5_2r8ot

9147417,0,t1_d8636sy,One of the cardinal rules of web app performance is to return a response as quickly as possible.  In a traditional web . application the way this would work is. User makes request for computationally expensive data.. You put a request for that data into a separate queueing system Celery Beanstalkd Gearman RabbitMQ etc... You return a response.. The web page youve just served the user starts to poll once a second or so to see if the data has been generated yet.. Another process thats entirely separate from both the queue server and the web server is running as a queue client.  It finishes its previous job then asks the queue server for more work.. The queue client does its work and saves the result to a database.. The web server now responds to the web clients poll with the newlyinserted data.Youll notice that there are a lot of moving parts here.  Thats just how web apps go and why people pay me lots of money to keep them going.   Seriously though its a pain in the ass.Depending on what exactly youre trying to do you may also be able to get away with precomputed results anticipate the users request do the calculation ahead of time then store that result in the database.

9185301,0,t1_d8frcca,DO NOT USE THIS AND DO NOT WRITE CODE LIKE THIS. It exists only to prove the point.gtthere probably isnt oneIndeed there provably isnt Here are wrappers that let you do a generalpurpose replacement.Converting while to for is fairly straightforward  we need to turn the condition of the while into a predicate i.e. a function that returns a boolean value specifically one intended to be passed around and used by other functions accepting no arguments. That is we represent the process of evaluating the condition. Then our adapter is easy    def whiletoforpredicate        while predicate            yieldThis makes a generator that generates a new element ondemand every time the predicate evaluates to true and then runs out of elements to iterate over. The element values are all None which is fine because were going to ignore the value. Now we can replace while xyz with for  in whiletoforlambda xyz.Converting for to while is a little trickier. The obvious idea would be to use indexing but that isnt supported by everything that can be iterated over. Instead Im going to make a generator that alternately returns True values and values from the original iterable and then returns False at the end    def fortowhileiterable        for item in iterable            yield True            yield item        yield FalseThe idea is that our while loop will attempt to consume two items from this generator each time through  itll use the boolean to decide whether to keep going and then grab the actual value. In order for this to work we need to set up a while loop that can actually consume elements from the generator. The way we do this is to hook into how Pythons iteration works using the builtin next. We replace    for item in iterable        dostuffwithitemwith    wrapper  fortowhileiterable    while nextwrapper        dostuffwithnextwrapperWe could also have played around with StopIteration but thats arguably even less fun.But yeah. for loops are for when you have some data to iterate over. while loops are for when you want to keep doing something until something else happens. We dont have a separate construct for do it a fixed determinedaheadoftime number of times current best practice is to fake it by creating an iterable of the appropriate length using range and then use a for loop.,learnpython,d8gayf8,1,t5_2r8ot

9273980,0,t3_57ffp2,Yes its absolutely ok to stick constants in global values when in makes sense. Look at any of the standard library files or any real project and youll see all kinds of constants exactly like this.And dont think of it as global think of it as module namespace since globals are literally module level.The whole point of this object oriented stuff is encapsulation into namespaces that make everything easier to manage. Usually that means everything goes into the most fine scope possible for all of the things that need it. So if its is inherently part of the module theres nothing wrong with it being in the module namespace just as if its inherently related to a class it should be in a class etc with class instance and function.The problem is that its rare for the appropriate scope to be at the module level. For example what if you wanted to change that range for a specific piece of your code? Surely you wouldnt touch the global since that would affect all future calls to that function and would rely on you putting things back where they should beMaybe default arguments to your function would be better.     put good default values    def myrandonumberwhatever start stop        note not of cryptographic quality and only random on the first call.       return startstopBut if your code is ever modifying variables at the global level then you almost surely have a problem.edit is something in here factually or philosophically incorrect or is someone grouchy?,learnpython,d8rjkdl,0,t5_2r8ot

Also a lot of games and engines use dynamic interpreted languages like Lua or Squirrel or even JavaScript for game logic in a C engine. The real issue here is twofold its hard to embed Python into a C based engine because the CPython C API isnt really designed for that and its hard to build an engine in pure Python because you really want things that are not game logic to be very fast and PyPy wasnt a viable target until very recently. ,learnpython,dat70ai,0,t5_2r8ot

As to the second question I have to resort to guessing since I dont want to spend too much time scouring the LPTHW website for the right answer on a mobile phone.Theres a setup.py there. Did you perhaps skip a step that told you to run pip install e . or some such? This will install your mygame package as a python module but in development mode so that the changes you make in your source files are immediately effective unlike with a regular install where a copy is made of your source files so that you will have to reinstall your package to make any changes take effect.If this does not ring a bell I guess its due to a difference in how youve set up your PYTHONPATH.

This gets you most of the way there for valid numbers but you would additionally need to check that the first digit is not zero when the string is longer than  character.To handle the expressions you can use split. E.g. .split results in a list .So if the string contains an operator  which you can check with in e.g  in  is true you would need to use split and then check both numbers for validity in the same way you checked a single number.

I might suggest starting with a very simple project the simplest project you can conceive of that is still worth doing and that moves you in the direction of one day making a multiplayer game. Then once you knock that out you will be in a good position to see where to go next. Maybe you build on your existing project or go straight for your ultimate goal or invest some time in a Python book or course or something to help fill in any holes in your understanding youve identified. But at this point it sounds like jumping into a project is your best next step.

10444720,0,t3_5pc9yp,So I typed up a huge response yesterday and forgot to copy it back into Reddit. Oh well hope this is useful anyway GUIs generally use a lot of subclassing. One of the reasons is that a class instance is basically an accepted way to use global variables we call these instance variables and they are named with self. on the front. You really really need to get used to classes and subclassing. You have a lot of other problems tooYou repeat a lot of code. If you find yourself copypasting sections of code then you need a function. DRYDont use wildcard imports.To nitpick global is a statement not a command.Learn to use string formatting.You have these odd loops you make with after. Why? Dont make a loop to monitor a value constantly when you just need to trigger a check. For instance check the XP value only when something happens to change the XP value. Especially for something like saveing values its insanely wasteful to ask your computer to save data every  milliseconds which you are doing when you really only need to save once when the program exits.You noted that your program is for python. but you are only one import check away from being python AND python compatible.Remember the naming conventions from PEP.You have variables with very similar names. For instance you have variables named AutoClicker Autoclicker and AutoSlicker. This kind of confusion is exactly why globals are considered evil. Moving your code into containers like classes and functions makes this much easier to deal with.A naked except is bad always specify which error you want to catch.I dont know if this will help but this is how I would restructure your program ,learnpython,dcrzr7g,1,t5_2r8ot

10492897,0,t1_dcx6mdc,From PEP gtThere should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it.In my opinion this is the one obvious way to do it.As utwistedteaspoon pointed out tryexcept clauses arent intended to define logic and program flow.  The name is right there in exception  they should be used to catch exceptional cases that will interrupt your program flow they should not be used for ordinary cases. gtReadability counts.Visually a tryexcept clause introduces unneccessary levels of indentation in this case which I would consider unpythonic.  Especially considering given the context of scraping several webpages the logic is probably already nested within a for clause and possibly an if statement an extra level of indentation on top of those will make the code less readable.,learnpython,dcxhagx,2,t5_2r8ot

Tryexcept is best used for cases where you know what exception would be raised and you identify that the exception being raised is acceptable andor you have a separate thing to do in the case it is raised.If you are adamant about catching ALL exceptions you can do    try         something    except         somethingBut this is regarded as bad practice for the reasons above.Youre asking if you should catch an exception inside or outside of a function. This is up to you I have no strong opinions on this someone else might.p.s. your questions on tryexcept are easily googled.

10761435,0,t1_ddpxojg,Look carefully through the step by step order of what happens when you run your script. You define the main and findkilometers functions. Nothing happens.. You call main.. main prints the heading.. mains loop starts running for the first time.. You assign a random integer to the miles variable.. main calls findkilometers.. findkilometers calculates and prints the km conversion. It has then finished its job so main resumes.. main prints the miles variable.. mains loop moves on to its second and following runs so steps  happen another  times.So as you can see your script has the two functions taking turns printing the miles and km figures. There are several ways you could do this differently.One way would be for the findkilometers function instead of printing the km figure after calculating it to return the figure ie replace your line  with return kilometers. But you need a way for main to use this result so instead of just calling findkilometers main should assign findkilometerss output to a variable. You can do this by replacing your line  with kilometers  findkilometersmiles. You can now edit line  so it prints the  numbers the miles and kilometervariables at the same time eg printt.formatmiles kilometers.By this point however you might decide that theres not much use in the findkilometers function so you might want to combine the two functions. Heres my whole version of your script which also makes the number of lines to print a parameter of the function so you can change it just by the argument you pass to the function instead of hardcoding it    import random        def mainloops        printMilestKilometers        for number in rangeloops            miles  random.randint             km  miles  .            printt.f.formatmiles km        main,learnpython,ddpyntx,3,t5_2r8ot

11337295,0,t3_61t45i,No there is no options of memory precedence. Lists are mutable and mutable objects are tricky to understand. Consider this     def funcatuple alist        atuple          alist      a      b      printab    funca b    printabWhat would you expect? There is no return statement so you might expect that a and b are unchanged. But a list is mutable so when the function mutates it the memory address and therefore the reference for all variables b in our case is updated to the new value. A tuple is immutable so line  reassigns to a new memory location so other variables a in our case still point to the old version. Your code is even more confusing since you reuse variable names. Lets add some comments    def funcxylis         lis.appendx  mutatation both the local AND global variables show this change        lis     assignment only the local variable is updated,learnpython,dfh29n9,3,t5_2r8ot

11457850,0,t1_dfupnf7,Sure. WARNING to avoid presumptions what follows are very basics and you may be bored.ampnbspYour web browser uses something called CSS which stands for cascading style sheets. If you think about a very basic web page like  basics your content is just words backgrounds and maybe some pictures its a little more exciting these days!. The web browser reads the html and prints what it is told to your screen such as a title maybe a paragraph or two of text and a picture of a cat. It is easy to see after doing some HTML basics that there are a lot of details the web browser needs what font should this title be? What about the paragraphs? What size should they each be? These details are given by the CSS which Ill call the style sheet. ampnbspAt the start of the HTML code the browser is pointed to another text file the style sheet where the nitty gritty details of every HTML object are given. This allows for consistency i.e all paragraphs are  font times new roman and when you get more comfortable it allows for custom classes to be made that allow for much faster HTML coding. If you want every cat picture to have a red border gotta highlight them kitties! you could make a custom CSS style with a custom label which you could put into your HTML code every time you coded in a picture of a cat. You dont want all pictures to be red bordered but at the same time you dont want to have to specify a red border every single time you code in a cat picture. ampnbspGetting to your question Boostrap is essentially some CSS files which already have the details font size border size width height color preconfigured for a bunch of useful stuff like buttons. It uses a grid system which allows you to layout your web pages and makes it easy to implement sidebars drop downs showhide stuff and generally navigate your site. ampnbspYou can always add custom styles to additional style sheets or change the Bootstrap styles themselves to suite your needs. I recomend working through the CodeAcademy lessons on HTML CSS and apperantly they have a Bootstrap course so try that too! Python can do the work on the backend but your browser doesnt read python my friend!,learnpython,dfuqmk8,3,t5_2r8ot

11563357,0,t1_dg6p90e,My point about the Morgan Freeman thing is that your in check will allow a match even if the first and last names are switched. Which for some names may be a possibility. I think you need a more exact check v  value maybe the variable names could be improved.I know what the k v key and value are supposed to represent but you should use print statements so you can see the exact data thats causing the failure. When you find that some persons name contains only a first name instead of firstlast then youll immediately understand why value is erroring. Or maybe one of them turned out completely empty somehow. I dont know thats why you have to follow it backwards.Im not sure why you arent getting print output. What if you put a print statement way up at the top where its guaranteed to execute? If you can see them there but not later then it sounds like theres something in the middle thats failing your expectations. If you cant get any output at all then Im not sure.,learnpython,dg6pmjf,1,t5_2r8ot

11577903,0,t1_dg8c5ql,Glad it helps.With web programming you have to think in terms of requests  basically what your web server does when you type in a URL click a link or submit a form. Requesting a web page looks like this and you can and should try doing this from the commandline with telnet to see what happens    GET index.html     host myhost.comGET is the method as mentioned in your routes. The host is matched to a server stanza by nginx and the index.html URI part is matched by a location stanza in nginx and possibly refined by your Flask app. Everything else builds on this.Web servers are specifically designed for this scenario. You only really need to have another server if your current one cant handle all the traffic for the sites it serves or you have another artificial barrier like ownership.,learnpython,dg8d0xe,1,t5_2r8ot

11622419,0,t1_dgde5lj,. sorry i think I was a bit inconsistent with my variable naming in my description. trees is should really be forest.dat        for j in rangelenforest.datOtherwise I do have an secondary file that gives a list of tree ID numbers. so should i just search those IDs and record their j index and use the space between j as the index range for their block data?. under Header  there is only a null row. just that first row with the integer value telling me how many trees are there. otherwise header  will be populated with either a tree ID or numerical data. so check for the null blocks in header  and use those as the row index for the ID?.  if i drop the lines wont that resize the array?. if im deleting null lines wouldnt the arrays have different sizes than the recorded indexing? now I have two large data frames. isnt this much MORE memory intensive? I was thinking that after i build my dictionary I clear the forest.dat from the memory and just work off the dictionary.. for my small testing now im just running off a shitty laptop so the memory usage is a problem but ultimately I will be running this off a cluster with GB memory available. so i guess my bigger concern would be speed. I also have  CPUs available but im not at a point when im coding to utilize that many. basically when i just have an index for the dataframe when i want to pass a single tree to a function I would need to create an array each time I send a tree into that fucntion. wouldnt it be faster to just split them up once in the beginning and from that point i dont need to create anymore?,learnpython,dgdeum6,1,t5_2r8ot

11659845,0,t1_dghihwr,So this is a fun project and so I hijacked it. If you enjoy the challenge of figuring stuff out for yourself dont read further!First I cleaned up your code a little and added the data file to the github repo Then I tried updating the canvas rectangles. Sadly I was wrong. This is much slower to update then just making new ones. I cant explain that. Then I tried using a PIL image. This is just as slow as the others but it has the advantage that I can enable the cheater. When I only update the GUI every  pixels this makes a pretty decent speed. Then I tried using the animation and image functions of matplotlib I didnt embed this into tkinter since its not needed but you could if you wanted to. This is by far the best and smoothest option.

It seems like what I might nee dto do then is break my long function up into several reasonably timed lambda functions each which return a portion of the context to the view and then reassemble them there. Otherwise I cant see any way of reporting back a progress from the lambda function before its finished. Do you know of a better way to do that without having to revamp too much code? For what its worth the structure of the code is basically    def longFunctionrequest        postData  request.POST.getblahblah        foo  callOtherFunctionpostData        bar  callOtherFunctionpostData        que  callOtherFunctionpostData        far  callOtherFunctionpostData         ... lots of other stuff that takes a long time lol        context  foo  foo bar  bar ... etc                request.sessioncontext  context        template  template.html        return renderrequest template contextSo assuming all of that gets tossed into a lambda function does it make more sense to have each callOtherFucntion a separate lambda function? or is there a way to somehow report back progress after each one finishes like Im doing now by just updating the metadata?Thanks very much for your time and help ... this is a difficult topic to find good help on so its appreciated when someone is willing to take a stab at it.
