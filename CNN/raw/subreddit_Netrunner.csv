A card that has other cards installed on it is called the host card while the card installed on it is called the hosted card. Hosted cards can leave play without affecting their host.Now there is an exception in the case of Personal Workshop and possibly other cards in the future which is specifically noted in the official FAQ  First under the Hosting sectiongt If a card is hosted but not installed the card is inactive.Then under card clarifications for Personal Workshopgt The Runner may use the first ability on Personal Workshop to host a program or a piece of hardware on it. Cards hosted by this ability are not installed and therefore are inactive.Thus the card hosted on PW is NOT active and therefore has no tangible effect on the game and cannot be targeted as a program.  If you review the active vs inactive rulings you will find your answer.Now if you want the official answer it was handed down by Lukas head designer for Android Netrunner gtThanks for the question.

The only way it becomes better then Melange is if you can get it to turn  for three more advancements. Its a high risk very high reward asset. When you get toward the end of the game it does become very hard to make it work so you cant rely on it as your main economy because toward the end of the game runners have their rig and they are able to get into most servers.

I think.EDIT Also since this is all hypothetical does we have access to cards that we know exist because spoliers but just havent been released yet?

A lot of the ICE that NBN is running has trace attempts in it so for Criminals you have Andy who comes with link and then add compromised employees who help you beat traces and also give money when ICE is rezzed and you have the tools needed to get the upper hand on NBN.

They would have also had to deal with X notation in the case of Profiteering which is easy enough to understand but isnt something theyve used yet perhaps for stylistic reasons.However for Power Shutdown the range of values for X as I see it is constantly in flux from  to However many cards you have left in RampD. Its easier and less wordy to establish an X and then refer to it rather than trash an installed program or piece of hardware with an install cost equal to or less than the number of cards trashed.

855724,0,t1_ch0tjy6,While I understand what youre trying to say Im not sure the actual statement that a deck that is contextually strong is not a strong deck is accurate. Sure if both players know exactly what the other player is using then a certain kind of deck is priviledged but the whole point of netrunner is that this is not the case so assuming that as a baseline for whether a deck is strong seems... odd. There are decks that are strong because they are efficiently constructed in such a way that they simply outgun the opponents deck and win regardless of what that player is doing. There are also decks that are strong specifically because they exploit a players desire to understand what theyre up against. You could call the two styles interactive ones that focus on reading the gamestate and the other players actions and taking advantage of them and noninteractive ones that have a gameplan thats pretty well laid out before the game and only adjust it as little as possible and they suit different kinds of player in the same way that aggro and control decks suit different kinds of player in MTG. Just as an example I put data ravens in a weyland deck of mine that has no scorched or even tag punishment specifically because i want players to hit it or access it and then believe Im playing T n B. If they do a data raven is a very efficient piece of ice. Now at a tournament things are ambiguous enough that if I dont blab to someone about how I mindgamed them they probably wont even realize my deck is built to wall out and score as cleanly as possible while not looking noticeably unlike a TnB deck and my next opponent will have to figure it out for themselves. Now even if my opponent knows the deck isnt running scorched its still fairly solid if not quite top tier but against someone who doesnt know Id argue that the deck goes from B to A almost S which is exactly the edge I want in a tournament situation.  Just like your extended play with a deck using that kind of informational warfare takes time and effort to learn to use efficiently. I wont say Im an amazing player but I win far more than I should with decks that are just not as good because Ive always played decks that abuse the expectations of my opponents and Im very comfortable actively controlling how the runner feels the game is progressing to my advantage. Its one of the parts of competitive netrunner that I actually find most appealing and rewarding to master that my decks are strong because I am playing them. To me that is real power. ,Netrunner,ch1jugh,1,t5_2td0c

891186,0,t3_24b1vh,Awesome review I look forward to the other factions Spin Cycle episode its really nice to see everything in retrospect and can make you rethink some older cards that may have been previously overlooked but have gained power as new cards come out.As to Fall Guy you guys spent a lot of time debating over whether its worth it for the Corp to trash it Ive found that in most of my Tag Me deck games the Corp tends to give up on trashing my stuff once a Fall Guy or two hit the table.  I dont run Kati in my Tag Me deck since itd probably always be worth it for the Corp to just spend the extra trashing her but John Masonari Armitage Codebusting and Dataleak tend to feel safe behind him.BUT the Corp will most definitely trash them after you have a scary turn.  Once I got Joshua B on the table I used my  clicks to Dataleak Dataleak Dataleak Dataleak Run unprotected Archives and score  agendas.After that turn the Corp spent  clicks and  bucks trashing  Fall Guys and my Dataleak.  I think every player has a certain tipping point.  For some they might just trash him the second he hits the table because they dont want to deal with it.  For others one Fall Guy might be enough to deter them from taking away your John Masonari or Prof Contacts.  Everyone values those things differently and it certainly depends on what youre currently doing with your resources and what the game is looking like.,Netrunner,ch5kypm,2,t5_2td0c

XD Im going to talk about QCoherence Chip and the unfortunate ruling that turned it from niche to borderline unplayable. When we first saw it people were excited about its cheap synergy with Overmind and the fact that a cautious runner could expand their rig for free. What killed it is the ruling that makes the chip get trashed if a program gets trashed from the grip... Im assuming even Data Hound can fuck with it by trashing a program from the stack. It makes sense but makes me feel bad feels. Just as the Oversight AI ruling with TyrantWoodcutterSalvage and the Because We Build It with Matrix Analyzer ruling make me feel bad feels. Theyre all sensible but it would have been exciting if things were ruled differently.thE weirD FEINT. YES! This card is so fuckin juicy.

Youre going to be installing Ms. Hanzo with Interns and advancing things for days.The Bad Fast Track. Simply because its not as good as people think it will be. Its not going to blow up the meta for Fast Advance. NBN will love it but Astrobiotics NBN cant score an Astroscript after a Fast Track unless a SanSan is rezzed an Astroscript is scored and they have  credit. Not a terribly common board state unless the runner overextended themselves. A Midseasons NBN will find their deck cluttered with combo pieces that are only necessary at certain times during the game. As defenses waver the corp will be hard pressed to defend servers and Fast Track does nothing except let the runner know to check HQ. What really excites me about this card is a deck running  difficulty agendas can use this to take advantage of a scoring window. My Jinteki deck wins way more often when I score a Nisei MK II. This card can be a fourth copy of that agenda letting me take advantage of a broke runner that trashed my PAD Campaign.thE weirD Mental Health Clinic.  credits is just below the borderline of uncomfortable to trash.

1120257,0,t1_chviylr,So I pondered over this a lot. When I was building decks to play with my friends and only had  core set I kept looking for lists that would not include hedge fund or sure gamble. It was an interesting idea for me at the time because they just seem so good.I built the untrashable deck by db which included no hedge funds and started realizing what its core purpose was. The idea was that the runner needs to spent credits to deny your economy costing him clicks to run centrals possibly encountering ice and then the run on the external server itself. A hedge fund is probably not a bad card however it does not tie in with this core concept and thus is a worse choice for this deck.Sure gamble and hedge fund are generally really good. They do however hinder some decks in achieving their goal. I have found this to be true especially in corp decks most runners can include a sure gamble except for maybe a connection deck with donutI think the basic idea of the article is to encourage you to do your own theory crafting.

A lot of the time people discover things about their cards that they never thought possible such as the runner doesnt actually need a functioning breaker suite. Depending on how you look at it mechanical theme decks are actually very common in Netrunner here are a few examplesBig Girls play with Monoliths  Chaos Theory builds the biggest rig imaginable with the best breakers for as cheap and as fast as she can. She doesnt mess around with corp games.Siphon Reina  Reina is the archnemesis of corps so she does her best to bring the right tools for the job Knight Rook Account Siphon Vamp to bring the pain on the corp.Supermodern Weyland  Weyland is bad to the bone. The worst part is they are getting rich off all their immoral actions allowing them to get built up far faster than a normal corp. Using their excessive amounts of cash if a runner makes a slip up and doesnt play carefully while also keeping up the pace Weyland will find them and blow up their house and neighborhood.ParaSucker Kate  Kate is the smartest cookie out there. But she does so well with simple things why doesnt she just borrow some tools from the anarchs? There is no need to build the best rig if the corp doesnt have any ice to protect themselves with all those parasites.

1524724,0,t3_2bo6ge,A little off topic but I think Aggressive Secretary especially in an unexpected deck is better and easier to hit. I run it in NBN. With the new NBN identity it also has good synergy.Bad Times is a dead card unless you can get the runner tagged and it takes a lot of investment to tag a runner who doesnt want to be tagged. Plus the runner is allowed to choose the programs they lose.Aggressive Secretary is never a dead card unless the runner knows it exists and at worst when it is on the board it makes the runner have to spend time trying to discern what it is and that issue is made worse when the corp starts advancing it. If it hits it can be devastating.No doubt Aggressive Secretary is harder to play effectively and is an investment in influence clicks and credits. But I still think it is better than Bad Times.Upstalk is probably going to produce many playable cards but Bad Times feels overhyped to me. Imagine having a hand of  cards and two of them are Bad Times. If you dont have a reliable mechanism to tag the runner your position is very poor.Not saying it cant be really good. I simply think the scenario for which Bad Times is good is fragile. For every  time it is a great play you may have    times that you really wish it was something else and thats generally a characteristic of a less than optimal card.,Netrunner,cj7eg6d,1,t5_2td0c

1587087,0,t1_cjf79xa,Man thats definitely fuckling with my brain. Lets see if I can sort this out The first sub is simple Brain damage on a successful trace. The second sub is the same but if the trace fails then the Runner loses a click. So either way this subroutine hurts the Runner. The third sub deals brain damage if the trace succeeds and ends the run if the trace fails. Again a nowin scenario for the Runner. The last sub lets the Runner choose continue the run or remove  brain damage and end the run. This ones winwin for the Runner.Its intriguing! Im worried about the second and third subs particularly because the Corp cant force a trace to fail in the same way that they can force a trace to succeed ie by having more money than the Runner. That means that if the Corp wants the unsuccessful half to fire they either have to somehow bait the Runner into paying to beat the trace or hope theyre playing against a highlink Runner. Either way its problematic. The second sub in particular is iffy  since the unsuccessful trigger is losing a click a smart Runner will never ever pay money on this trace either they click through it to avoid the brain damage or they dont mind the brain damage in which case they just dont pay money for that trace. The only exception is if they encounter this with no clicks left in which case they might try to pay to beat the trace since losing a click at that point is irrelevant.The third sub is odd too  the run ends if the Runner pays enough to beat the trace. But they could just not pay anything and have the trace be successful and then remove the brain damage and end the run with the next subroutine. In short its an interesting idea but I think it needs to be tightened up a bit. I also think  cost plus the bad publicity is way too expensive. Consider how much extra money the Corp will have to put into the traces to get them to fire and youre easily paying three times the strength of the ice for inconsistent effects. Id rather pay one more for a much stronger Heimdall or  more for a more painful Janus.,Netrunner,cjf82b5,4,t5_2td0c

1602697,1,t3_2cnfb4,I dont care for Currents. Its another way for players to interact but its not as interesting as runs or traces. Theres no strategy to using them other than playing them from hand.Worse yet the two ways to get out from under your opponents Current are lame. Either you stock your own which just adds overhead to deck building. Every deck now has to cram in some Currents just for the contingency even if they dont complement the decks strategy. Or get some points which a good Current should help prevent. If you cant count on a Current to stay in play for more than a turn then whats the point in making it a Current and not a vanilla EventOperation?This one is kind of a pet peeve of mine but its a valid complaint Theyre less thematic than Programs and Ice and other card types too. They dont describe anything unique about the setting. I look forward to AssetsResources and EventsOperations that interact with Currents but arent themselves. Maybe that would add some strategy and interesting decisions to the mechanic. In the meantime its a step away from the themebakedintomechanics elegance that I love so much in ANR.,Netrunner,cjh6t6v,0,t5_2td0c

When RampD has dry spells those dry spells last a few turns longer allowing asset economy and HB Identity money to trigger more.

1646978,0,t3_2d6d1o,I think theres a tendency amongst boardgamers to confuse the question will I like this game with the question do you like this game. If its a game they enjoy they love telling people about it and want to introduce more people to it. Just keep that in mind when you go to any forum dedicated to a game and ask them for advice. The big question for you to answer is will I build my own decks with the cards in the core set? I see some answers from people who stuck to only the core set for months but they all seem to have been building their own decks rather than playing with the preconstructed decks. It would be great if one of the mythical people who play only with the preconstructed decks would show up and tell you what they think. I did manage to find a couple of reviews on BGG by people who play Netrunner without deckbuilding. Theres also this post by someone who hated it. The general consensus there seemed to be if you want a game where you can just buy a box open it up shuffle the cards and play then no Netrunner is probably not the game for you.But all thats assuming you dont want to build decks.

1700903,0,t3_2dvhoc,I have been playing a very similar version of this deck for a few weeks now and I think it does its job very well.  Rushing is a very different playstyle from FA or glacier so it can take some getting used to.  I think the biggest thing to remember with this type of deck is it has  win conditions and not to get focused on a scorch win.Taurus was meh.  Probably worth a  of but if  plascretes come up then program destruction was more important than hardware destruction.The deck actually does well vs any deck using nonai breakers by focusing on killing corroder by any means.  AI breakers like overmind are a nightmare for this deck especially if you are flooded.  I am currently testing a build of  Snare  Subliminal  Aggressive secretary  SEA Source and change false lead to posted bounty.  Along with will o wisp Im hoping AI matchups wont be so  sidedThis is my favorite deck to play so far.  Multiple win conditions super aggro with the control elements of program destruction and scorch.  Perfect balance if you are brave enough to accept the occasional flood I play Anon instead of JacksonI dont get many dead draws outside of flooding.  I think power shutdown might be worth a  of. When you flip GRNDL they WILL expect scorch but that just means you have to be more careful with what breaker you focus on killing and what your remote and RampD look like.  Not all people expected that much program hate.I did land a Snare! False Lead Scorch Scorch  time.  From what I have seen this combo cant be relied on too much and with the amount of times I could IAA when the runner didnt have a breaker Posted Bounty may work better but I am still testing.As I said above dont get hung up on Scorch.  The best way to win with this deck is to get to  points ASAP.  If some of those points is an overscored Atlas then its GG.  If not you can bait the runner into running with low credits then blow them up.,Netrunner,cjtk7s9,1,t5_2td0c

I can only see this working with one or moe wokshops out. oue just gonna have to be bold and play cautiosly about it and may need to include New Angeles City Hall just to get the tags out before they trash your workshops. Definitely keep modded though. As for ProCon and Magnum why not include a full set of both if they will be the backbone of your swiss army shennanigans? Just get rid of some redundancies to get some card slots back. For instance if youre planning on Test RunScavenge Morning Star with Suckers out why bother with Corroder? If you hit something that MS cant smash open just use  Grappling Hooks Sharpshooters Knights or DVD to get through. Also with ProCon will you really need  Daily Casts? Or  Magnums for that matter since you can tutor it? I really think MagnumPro ConWorkshop are the only way to get resolve the potential bottlenecking that might happen as well as build momentum. ou dont have a wa of slowing the corp down like a criminal does so you might as well ensure that you not slow yourself down either.If youre afraid of Tags why not include  Disruptor and  Fall Guy Crim  Inf along with your NACH to help deal with it.

1787445,0,t1_ck4g787,Thanks  Phoenix is my favorite too. Minotaur is more or less intended to be a bigger slightly more punishing version of chimera which offers some defense against parasite and ai as well. Put it on an early scoring remote to rush out an agenda. Once the runner has two different breakers out it should have served its purpose and you can let it derez unlessuntil you manage to trash them. Maybe it would be better as a  like gorgon though  or maybe with this purpose in mind it could be appropriate to add guards antibypass ability as well.With gorgon I agree that it is unlikely the runner would use more than one program during the encounter datasucker  icebreaker is the only real possibility that i can think of. Properly placed though like say in front of a unrezzed chimera or minotaur it forces the runner to come up with solutions besides a traditional rig. Maybe it would make sense to switch it to an onrez ability like the other ones? Whenever you rez gorgon you may choose an installed program and pay  credits to prevent that program from being used until the end of the run. It changes the use cases a bit.

They accessed this from a remote server and they know that the corp has Diversified Portfolio.. They want this in Archives where they can trigger this at will.

1824963,0,t1_ck93je3,ampampamp Singular they sfw gtgtSingular they is the use of they or its inflected or derivative forms such as them their or themselves to refer to a single person or an antecedent that is grammatically singular. It typically occurs with an antecedent of indeterminate gender as in sentences such asgtgt Everyone returned to their seats. gt Somebody left their umbrella in the office. Would they please collect it. gt If a person doesnt want to go on living they are often very difficult to help. gt The patient should be told at the outset how much they will be required to pay. gt But a journalist should not be forced to reveal their sources. gtA reason for its use is that English has no dedicated singular personal pronoun of indeterminate gender. In some cases its use can be explained by notional agreement because words like everyone though singular in form are plural in meaning. One reason for its increased use may be the movement to genderinclusive language in the twentieth century but it has been used by respected writers for centuries.gtThough singular they has a long history of usage and is common in everyday English its use has been criticized since the late nineteenth century and acceptance varies.gtInteresting English personal pronouns | She | Inflection | Agreement linguistics Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckjqt oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckjqt.

I presume you will choose it to be used on RampD.  You have no Paintbrush or Tinkering in order to let you use the cybercypher against anything besides the first piece of per turn and code gates. Unless there is something Im missing this deck would be better as a Kate or Chaos Theory deck. Next while it may be your strategy to have few icebreakers you have no cards that let you search for them and they are in such low density that the chances of you finding them when you need them is minuscule. Chances are your opponent will realize what you are doing and lock down RampampD and youll be stuck for the rest of the game. It sounds like youre looking for an explosive start but I think youre going to hit some real consistency issues.

1996590,0,t3_2hktiz,Beyond the starter set? Depends where youre playing how often and what you like...If youve gotten the core set to play between yourself and a partner a far from uncommon playstyle then the core set alone is pretty solid. However it is very strongly helped by the first datapack of the Genesis Cycle called What Lies Ahead. It gives each corporation one additional agenda meaning that corp decks now have a choice as to which agendas to play and begins rounding out the core set nicely.Expanding on starter set between  people the rest of the Genesis Cycle is very very solid too. For deckbuilding in a shared group the Genesis Cycle is the  cards they couldnt fit into the core set. Absolutely brilliant stuff.If you got the core set as a solo player wholl be playing games in a larger meta such as at a game store then things change a bit. As uexozik points out Bad Publicity have some good videos discussing this. However if you happen to enjoy Shaper or Jinteki factions then their respective deluxe boxes Creation and Control for Shaper Honour and Profit for Jinteki are almost mandatory.Otherwise Id suggest you simply grab any datapacks that interest you with a focus on the Genesis Cycle if possible could be a little difficult as most of its out of print. A second core set will be helpful too but I tend to think its more for when youve got all the datapacks first. For any more detailed recommendations though youll have to tell us where you want to go?

2075002,0,t1_cl3ko7d,Exactly. The condition of no credits left is constantly waiting to be triggered but that doesnt make the whole thing a constant ability. If for example you used Fall Guy to prevent an empty Daily Casts from trashing itself you would successfully prevent that specific trashing. But the condition of having no credits left would still be met so it would immediately trigger again. Rachel Beckmans trash ability is constant but thats not why she would immediately be trashed after being saved by a Fall Guy. Shes immediately be trashed because she is trashed if the Runner is in the state of being tagged. She could just as easily say When you are tagged trash Rachel Beckman and still function the same way she does now. For what its worth they probably didnt word it this way in the hopes of avoiding more confusion then the card has already caused. Now if she said trash Rachel Beckman if you take a tag or when you take a tag trash Rachel Beckman then you could save her with a Fall Guy because that is a specific effect that could happen rather than a state the runner could be in. ,Netrunner,cl3kti3,1,t5_2td0c

I had an interesting run against Blue Sun running an off the wall Reina build. It used Blackat to ensure efficient breaks of their big ice. Emergency shutdowns and crescentus to shut down their ice after breaks. So for example. Run HQ they rez cadecous and you break break with mimic and derez with crecentus.  Then you Emergency shut down their hadrians or curtain wall that was OAId. No free money for you. FAOs to kill off the ice you know he cant afford to rez now. The real goal is recurring credits to get in cheaply each turn and then destroy ice after its been rezzed. Its a little weak to archers. But Blue Sun doesnt seem to run small easy to score agendas.

2286535,0,t3_2lfbzk,My first reaction was definitely that I was very worried about losing use in my current cards. After thinking about it for a while I did see some of the sense in it. What Im really wondering about are the identity cards that were printed in cycles instead of deluxe expansions. In a few years Andromeda RP and Whizzard  will disappear followed by NEH Quetzal and The Foundry. Unlike other cards these are fairly major decks that will become unplayable in tournaments. Cards that fixed problems from the Core Set like Plascrete and Jackson Howard will disappear and need to be replaced by other cards with similar effects. Finally there will definitely be a sentimental loss when these cards are no longer tournament legal. While they may no longer be top notch in the future meta the idea that wont be able to play my current runner deck that I love makes me a little sad.

2323911,0,t1_clyj56t,Completely agree about there being a bit of rockpaperscissor problem with runner deck design right now. Im really hoping its something that can be solved by printing runner cards that are not combo dependent. Like you said there is little space to run all the specific counters so when you look at things like stealth breakers which require you to build around them things get even tighter in your builds.The solution to this? Im thinking stronger runner economy. If you can get runners more economy with less cards you free up space and allow them to catch up with the Corp economy cards of the last two cycles. If this happens things may balance a bit. I gotta pay  credits to run a server and battle Caprice? Ok give me a way to consistently make that kind of money in less than  full turns without being too slow to compete with NEH.Speaking of Chris Hs Kit deck.

While popping an OAId Curtain Wall may be satisfying it is rarely going to result in more than a neutral scenario for the corp  worse it enables SEA Source without a chance of retrieving an agenda in optimal scenarios.You said it yourself youd rather use Parasite as a counter to Tollbooth and Parasite has negative synergy with DVD.

2608339,0,t1_cmz18aj,Yes. I should have been clearer perhaps. My point is that paying the costs is before the playing of the card and that both are completely different steps thus giving both Order of Sol and Tenma a chance to trigger.

2651544,0,t1_cn4bq7r,It could work like that for Nasir and Gordian blade but thats the only time. Outside Advanceable subroutine ICEEG Corp Rezzes NEXT Bronze and uses  IT Token to boost the Strength by  to . Nasir pays C to boost Gordian to Str  preencounter since his credits are reset at this point. Corp then uses  IT token to boost strength by  to . Nasir then pays all his remaining  credits to boost the strength of Gordian to .Corp can now pass in which case Nasirs Credits are set to C and he can then pay C to boost and break the Bronze. Or the Corp can use  IT tokens to boost the Strength of the NEXT Bronze by  to  Nasir will then need to clone chip in a Cache or some other trickery to break but he can do that during the encounter so he passes and the timing moves to the encounter either way.Normally the Runner will break subroutines after boosting strength before passing as otherwise the corp would just pass and all the subs would fire as there wasnt any breaking. The only time this isnt the case is if you either boost strength outside an encounter GordianIntiPipelineBatteringRam or use AstroScript Pilot Program to add a subroutine to advanceable ice such as Tyrant. You could boost the strength of Tyrant let the runner pay nearly all their credits breaking it then use the IT and astro counter to add one unbroken End the Run and boost the strength again preventing them from getting in.,Netrunner,cn4orjl,1,t5_2td0c
2664976,0,t3_2qi8z8,Cut Indexing. You have RampD Interface and The Makers Eye already to access a bunch of cards from RampD. You dont need more RampD Pressure. Maybe add an Escher to give something to do on HQ.Id cut Exile for Kate with your limited card pool. It probably feels a bit disappointing to switch to a more common ID but Exile is a lot less flexible and youre missing some cards he really wants. For example Test Run so you can play Test Run  Scavenge which gives you a bunch of new ways to trigger his ID. Kate does well with Replicator decks since you constantly have hardware available to install.If you switch to Exile you can cut Retrieval Run. With the influence maybe add some Datasuckers to make your Atmen more flexible. Id also cut Toolbox. Your rig doesnt need the MU much and you have recurring credits with Cyberfeeder already.

That ice has  strength until the end of the turn for each power counter including the one spent on IT Department at the time this power counter was removed.orgt Hosted power counter Choose a rezzed piece of ice.

2691945,0,t1_cn9vb3t,Nah  There was no reason to think IT worked the way Lucas is saying it does. That being said I think the main thing that Lucas is playing off the idea that the until the end of the turn part is what makes it constant. But even then theres no reason for anyone to think that the boost given by IT is constantly referencing the number of counters on IT instead of just looking once applying the strength and then dropping the boost at the end of turn. IMO the way everyone was thinking it worked was the correct way.

The stealth rig works pretty well in Shaper and takes about the same amount of time to set up as Big Rig and is as good at breaking through those taxing ice. Stealth can make a single nearlyfree run every turn while big rig can make multiple but has to then make back their credits somehow.  I think it all comes down to what youre planning to do.

3005725,0,t1_co90q9s,Not disagreeing with you but looking to clarify something.Lets imagine some kind of runner event that say something like Make a run. If the run is successful gain  cred for each subroutine on any ice encountered during the runLets say you do that event on a server thats from outside in Ice Wall gt Wormhole gt Wall of Static and theres another server somewhere with a rezzed Sensei. The runner breaks the ice wall but cant break the wormhole which fires off the Sensei. From what youre saying Sensei should add ETR subs to Wormhole and Wall of Static but does Ice Wall also get an additional ETR sub? In other words is Sensei looking for some kind of game state note of which pieces of ice have been encountered during the run and applying its effect to them? Does the runner get  credits or  from the event?I get really confused with the rules in this game when it comes to what the game does and does not remember about past events.EDIT If your answer to the question is no Ice Wall doesnt get the second sub and the runner gets  credits  from ice wall  from wormhole and  from wall of static why? I figure that since the moment of encounter would have passed for Wormhole it would fall under the category of ice encountered as a historical description but then so would Ice Wall.,Netrunner,co9jhw7,1,t5_2td0c

The Ice can be cheap as hell if you want but preferrably it should do damage trash a program or end the run at a very high cost to break.. Eater makes it so you cant access if you break the ice. She will waste  clicks running your server. If the Ice does damage or trashes programs shell have to break it on the first run to avoid suffering the subroutines. If she can pull the correct Cutlery event then shell run again and break it. Third click shell run the empty server and you rez Ash.

3287541,0,t3_2xrr9f,Personally the theme of cards does not affect my deck building at all. Even so I end up with very colorful decks and ideas represented by them so it all works out. If you want more of the Android lore pretty quickly I advise you get your game group together and play Android the board game. It is one of the most complex games I have ever played but the flavor is incredible. Raymond Flint and Caprice Nise running around solving murders either by absolving or condemning Noise Thomas Haas and a host of others who may yet become runners or cards. Floyd the Biroid and his bonkers abilities tied to the three laws of robotics and his run ins with Humanity First. The presence of Mr Li as one of the playable characters contacts. And then the conspiracy. Android started as an ultra flavorful one shot game that then got its themes imported over to Netrunner and while the import has improved the lore in many ways it helps to go back to where it all began.

Some variation of corp scored Hades Fragment  Glenn Station hosted Government Takeover giving the corp  points and occupying  points in the game. Optional to score an additional  pointer. Optional to forfeit points.  Runner must be forced to have  or  points with  or  shikyu added negative points. Optional to forfeit points Runner must not have any agenda forfeiting cards available to use on shi kyu or abilities that force the corp to discard. Corp must choose to gain credits for all of their clicks or some variation of using archived memories reclamation order or any card ability that uses a click. Corp must not try to remove government takeover or otherwise try to score agendasflatline.This condition is arguably an infinite loop but its one which is easy to escape if you throw in other actions such as playing Archived Memories.gtInfinite LoopsgtIf an infinite loop is created the player responsible for the loopmust choose a number. The loop instantaneously resolves thatmany times and then ends. The Runner must jack out to endan infinite loop that occurs during a run unless a card abilityprevents that from occurring. If the Runner cannot jack outthen it is the Corps responsibility to end the loop by letting theRunner through to the server.If you accept the conditions that include the possibility that the runnercorp is willing to forfeit agendas rather than hosting on Glenn Station then it would be an unresolvable tie.,Netrunner,cp360mw,2,t5_2td0c

3308007,0,t3_2xyq3f,The biggest benefit that Ive found from trying this cards out that I had no idea of before was that they reduce credit thresholds. This is just as valuable as their credit discount so you almost have to double count it.We translate Sure Gamble to gain creditc if you have creditc but this is not the case when you have PPVP. Now you can play Sure Gamble at creditc which saves you clickclick to get a credit and PPVPs recurringcredrecur is now a real credit still gain creditc for a net of creditc. Each use of PPVP can net you a clickclick and creditc based on when you play it. Finally that happens more often than not in the decks PPVP is used in as they hit credit bursts and spend them all. Having that lower threshold for econ cards reduces your tempo hit.That being said I dont know if it is best to think of each PPVP use as creditc  clickclick or creditc but it does pay off faster than creditc payback per use.Something similar happens with Andy Drip Supplier. As others have pointed out it lets you host cards there getting them out of your hand. What really blows me away when I often lose to this deck is that you can play the same as Prepaid Kate. You can spend most of your credits in a turn let your drip start of turn cards trigger and use that money to trigger supplier to get other drip cards out for free or creditc or creditc. With two of any combination of Data Folding and Underworld Contact you can get an RampD interface out between your turns essential for free pop Kati and hit RampD hard.

3439659,0,t3_2zlvrd,If HQ is open im going to run it with legwork or account siphon or dirty laundry.If RampD is open im going to index or makes eye or dirty laundry.  Heck i might just play medium and run  times.Ill most likey facecheck the one iced server to make you spend credits.The only way im running that mushin server is if you are at  credits.  You have a limited amount of mushin and its not going to win you the game but could lose me the game.  Its worth it to let you score that early for the slight temp hit of only having one ice out and use that to instead increase my board position.Look at in in my position.  Just assuming a  its a trap If i dont run it i have a  you get a few points or sit there with a wasted trap.  not terrible.  If i do run it theres a  i get a few points or take  brain damage or just straight up lose.So in both scenarios players can get a few points.  In one scenario someone wastes a trap and in the other one the player either just loses or gets a severe disadvantage.  The two losses arent equal so im going to go with the one thats not going to lose me the game.Now if you have  agenda points on the table?  hell yess Im running that server.

This is where Siphon can be a problem because if you spend your money rezzing to prevent credits being stolen that leaves you with no money to rez ice no money to use on the psi game and no money to boost the Ash trace.

3806388,0,t3_340bas,When I first saw this card I had the same ideas as most of the other commenters in this thread. This will definitely soften up the runner for a kill. So I built an entire deck around it. The only goal of the deck was to force the runner to hit this hard so they would be softened up for the kill.First this is that only certain ICE work with this. You can only use ICE where the runner must break all subroutines. ETR ICE are the obvious choice because the runner is either going to let you score or shrink their hand size. Program trashing ICE are also good. Archer is not good because they can just let you get two credits. Neural Katana is good because yes youll gladly let them take  net damage. Komainu and Tsurugi are bad because they will happily just take  net damage. Tracing ICE are bad because they can just let you trace.The other thing about this card is that you have to rez it before the runner even hits the first ICE. They see it now. They behave accordingly. I had a lot of runners see it let the first ICE ETR. Then they destroyed ICE on that server one by one. Parasite jack out. Knifed jack out. It was trivial for them to play around it.Another thing is that the card is only good behind a big stack of ICE. Its very hard to get  ICE stacked up and be able to pay for all that. If you only have one or two its no big deal to the runner. Theyll go in let their hand size be a little bit smaller for a turn and trash this grid. And thats the other issue. With a  trash cost this will almost always get trashed. Its going to shrink the runners hand size once and only once every time you installrez it. The only way to make this work is if you combine it with brain damage. If you can land some brain damage on the runner perhaps with an overwriter then this card becomes much stronger. You need to stack a lot less ICE in front of it to make it very very dangerous.Much like Heinlein Grid this card has a very powerful effect and you want to make it work. But in reality its just too easy for the runner to play around it. Mostly it ends up being a minor annoyance to them and then its gone.,Netrunner,cqq5poa,13,t5_2td0c

3878747,0,t3_34v3ns,Some thoughts Your ice is terrible. Ichi Ice Wall and maybe DatapikeWall of Static are alright. The rest? Garbage. Zed isnt dead weight if he isnt present behind youre two other bioroids. Matrix Analyzer doesnt do anything special Woodcutter is wierd and Chum is out of place and generally not that good. So simple question  why are you playing NEXT design? I mean Im a NEXT guy to the core but this deck seems off. Youve got some ice the right agendas and the Successful Demos for the rush strategy. Seems solid. But when you look at the ice few of them actually stop the runner much. Chimera and Rototurret are Parasite food. the walls and Datapike are good gear check but then they roll over  which is fine if your other ICE packed a punch. Which these do not. Sadly youre missing one of the key glacier components  Ash. Hes great and kinda critical for scoring those PriReqs. Viper is probably better than Analzyer or Zed. then again a bucket full of piss is better than Zed. Id consider in particular order Ichi . Hemdall . Tollbooth Viktor . for more hard hitting things. Ive found PopUp Window to be critical to my current next design build. On another note   ice is normal for a non NEXT deck but if youre playing NEXT design you want to get that into the   range. If you want to play defensively youre going to need bigger ice. It doesnt matter how much money you have when the runner is going to town on RampD with a Medium. Also WTF Director Haas?

Theyre even more spaceconstrained than the Runner is so letting them include tracing on a card that still has meaning even when the trace is made irrelevant by link seems to me to be the best way to encourage more tracing in the game which in turn seems to me to be the best way to encourage more link in the game.,Netrunner,csweh0c,2,t5_2td0c

4533780,0,t1_ct1qai0,That seems a lot better than the earlier list. Try playing some games and see what you like and what you dont like. It seems to me like the deck might be lacking a direction. What I mean its got a bunch of different ideas packed into it drip econ with UWC and DF cloud breakers denial RampD lock. I guess the idea is to mostly set up early game and pretty much only after that run the centrals and the remote if corp tries to score. You might have a problem in early game because you cannot reliably threaten a remote and faster corps NBN FA maybe HBFA could even get away with scoring  before youre set up to lock the centrals. Especially vs HB the BnE suite needs a lot of breakers  installed before they get you in.That being said against slower corps the possibility of locking RampD is definitely real. However it still might not be a guaranteed win especially vs RP as their ICE will tax you a lot and the drip might not be enough. Breaking a Tollbooth with Zu or an Eli with Corroder is a pain and you cannot permanently get rid of those. The denial part of the plan does help with that of course but if you cant shut down the Sundews etc early it could easily get way out of hand later.I could be wrong on the early aggression part therere  special orders and lots of breakers but BnE are unreliable early so maybe it is possible to get the pressure on early. That all needs testing though but maybe Ive given you something to keep an eye out for when you do. Happy gaming! ,Netrunner,ct2473w,1,t5_2td0c

4539725,0,t1_ct2q1tq,My background is a competitive Magic Judge. Ive been to GPs Ive been to conferences where more experienced judges give seminars on specific topics...Judges provide Customer Service primarily. Judges have nothing to do without players so ultimately were here for the players. Players should never feel afraid to call a judge! Seriously call on us for anything! We arent scary boogeymen out to ruin your fun. Next the purpose of Judges is to arbitrate disputes. If something weird or wonky happens in a game but both players agree on what should happen you can just keep on playing! First because if youre both pretty happy about the result then youre having fun which means Job Accomplished. Second Judges should only get involved if they see a game rule being actively broken or if called over. They shouldnt get involved because they feel like it. Finally because trying to enforce you should always call a judge is laughable at best. If two players DISAGREE on the outcome of an event thats the Primary Task that judges are equipped to handle! Call one over and see what should happen. Theyre a neutral party!The IPG and JAR combine to delineate Serious Times and Fun Times tournament types. The IPG specifically is for Competitive where competition requires that the same remedies be used across the board in every store in every tournament. Theres a section on cheating in both documents but for the vast majority of each the guide is assuming that no cheating is occuring. They cover what to do when something doesnt go according to the rules. They arent about Punishing infractions. Theyre about This went wrong. Now what?The IPG differs from the JAR the JAR will try to fix any problems that arise. The IPG at competitive events will not usually try to fix things. Judges are told repeatedly that Fixing the Board State is NOT your job at Competitive events. The board state is already wrong and anything done to it further is still wrong. The IPG prescribes specific remedies to specific situations which are deemed to be as fair as possible with the intent of getting players back to playing their game.We need guidelines in Netrunner so that the competitive experience is consistent. We need guidelines so judges know what to do in specific situations. We need guidelines for judges to point to and say Youve broken the rules this is the consequence. We need guidelines so that judges are not forced to take things casebycase delivering varying fixes and penalties.Im relatively passionate about this topic because its relevant to my interests and I feel this is the one hole in competitive Netrunner at this time.,Netrunner,ct2v116,10,t5_2td0c

4678698,0,t3_3f0w95,I dont think its less fun but in tournament settings playing corp has become infinitely more difficult. You either need to outrace the runner to  points which is super hard against Kate because of Clot or kill the runner through some kind of damage. On top of that runners can be set up very quickly. At regionals  of my  games featured the pancakes combo and  of them used Faust. Theres just not a lot a corp can do once runners get really set up unless they manage a flatline. Its a tough spot for sure right now but Im sure corp will get plenty of great tools or find new ways to play around it. BattyCaprice is a good start since you dont need a ton of money to win psi games and so are BiotechArgus kill decks.

All lists are in order of how good I think the packs are for each faction.Best Generalist PacksAll That Remains  gtThis pack contains the dog breakers of which Rex and Lady have become defacto breakers for their respective factions. It also contains Leela Patel who is a great runner that works well with previously existing criminal cards. It also contains Utopia Shard which is the best generalpurpose shard. On the corp side you get Executive Bootcamp which is great in a variety of decks crossfaction as well as Daily Business Show which is such a good card that can go in virtually any deck if it has the influence for it. People were even going down to  Jacksons to fit more of these when it came out. Corp also gets Snatch And Grab which is also great in more than a few decks.Up and Over  gtThis pack contains something for everyone. For HB it has Architect which is autoinclude in any HB deck and is widely importable. NBN gets Reversed Accounts which is another widely importable trap that glacier decks tend to love. Weyland gets Blue Sun which means you can start actually playing Weyland and Changeling which is a solid Weyland ICE that can be tough for the runner to deal with. Jinteki gets Ashigaru which is a staple include in any glacier style Jinteki deck. Hades Fragment is a fantastic neutral agenda that can vie for any point slot. Shapers get Astrolabe one of the best generalist consoles in the game. Criminals... dont actually get much here that doesnt require a bunch of other packs to use. Anarch get Inject which is one of the better draw cards at their disposal.Best Packs for HBThe Spaces BetweengtGets you The Foundry identity which can be fun in general but also really neat once you obtain the NEXT suite or check out the Grail suite. You also get Enhanced Login Protocol which is highly exportable and a very good current. Heinlein Grid is another good HB card that can really mess with some runners. Eden Fragment is really important for HB too. I think just about any coreset HB deck will want to run Eden Fragment.First Contactgt Not really that much here. Elizas Toybox can be fun. IQ is what you want this pack for. Its a good midstrength codegate for HB. Not used that much anymore but its nice to have. Crisium Grid is a Weyland card but is an important piece for dealing with certain runner setups and HB will often import it.Best Packs for NBNUpstalk  gtNear Earth Hub. The best NBN Identity so far though Haarpsichord also seems strong. You need this just to be playing NBN in this day and age.Best Packs for Weyland To be clear After already getting Blue Sun from Up and OverFirst ContactgtCrisium Grid is in here which fits into just about any Weyland deck. It also has Wendigo which is an alright codegate that has a place in some decks. Shattered Remains is possibly the best trap you can have for any Scorched kill deck to get rid of that pesky Plascrete.UpstalkgtThe Root is a fun card to mess around with and I think it just gets better the more Asset support that comes out for Weyland. Very good to have on hand. Taurus is an awesome sentry and I think a necessary include in any deck that is trying to kill the runner as another avenue to get rid of that Plascrete.Best Packs for JintekiUpstalkgt This has Lotus Field which is great in any Jinteki and also very very exportable. Most decks would take a Lotus Field with a spare influence. Even these days.The Sourcegt This has Industrial Genomics which is one of my personal favorite fun IDs.Best Packs for ShaperUpstalkgt This gets you Nasir who is a fun nonstandard runner to mess around with.First Contactgt This has Refractor which is a great stealth codegate breaker and usable right out of the box in Kit. Order of Sol is also great in Nasir.Best Packs for CriminalFirst ContactgtBoxE is a solid exportable console for those who dont know which console they want. The Supplier is also fun to mess with and potentially build a deck around.Best Packs for AnarchThe Spaces Betweengt This bad boy gets you DVD which is just bonkers good and has a place in any Anarch deck you could dream of. This pack also contains Cache which was basically explicitly made for Noise. Scrubbed is I think an underrated current.HONOR amp PROFITgtTheres really not anything here that I would say is particularly useful outside of Criminal or Jinteki directly. I believe its necessary if youre playing either of those factions but not outside of that.And thats that. There are other good cards in various data packs that I didnt highlight. Theres nothing particularly notable for particular factions beyond what I put up there I think. I also avoided categorizing packs by what archetype they support ie. NEXT and Grail suites are spread throughout basically every pack. I know youre trying to move away from verbosity my descriptions are here for the discussion.If I had to give a final hierarchical rating that completely disregarded which particular faction you are trying to play then Id probably go.

The tips on how to actually manipulate the board were helpful as well particularly the mushin threat flowed by clicking for creds. Ill be fixing my ice because a lot of what you said was on point. Cheap gear checks and damage seem like the way to go. I also forgot that mimic hits katana so I might be cutting it down to one or out entirely in favour of cortex lock or some other high dmg single sub ice.

Clot wasnt enough on its own. Id like to see a Crim card that lets you access HQ if the corp installs and scores an agenda in the same turn something that would hurt CI way way less than a normal NBN fastadvance deck for instance.I also like that DampD looks to open up a lot of new avenues for the faction but if they arent as good as the crazydominant current ideas its almost like whats the point? as far as the Meta goes.,Netrunner,cumn57j,1,t5_2td0c

5125294,0,t1_cv3s2zg,Im going to have to respectfully disagree with you on this one.  Caprice has and has always had a ton of counterplay. First the obvious one that everyone has convinced themselves isnt worth using  There IS a card that is basically a hardcounter to her.  So if you ever find yourself losing too much to her in particular there is a pretty good answer.  Or alternately Drive By if shes not rezzed   Second  You can wait for the corp to get poor.  A broke corp is a dead caprice.  Either because you vampedaccount siphoned them down or because you just made them rez too much ice.   Third  Shes vulnerable to ice destruction or mitigation cards like Femme.  If running against her is cheap she tends to die.   Forth  Similarly if your rig is efficient enough you can just run her server repeatedly until she dies.  Recurring credits tend to be great for this.  Especially stealth. And finally possibly the most important counterplay  You can always just run somewhere else.  She can protect at most one server.  If your gameplan requires you to get into one server then your gameplan is probably too narrow.  Is she protecting a scoring server?  Start running HQ.  Start making deep digs on RampD.  Accept that agendas in the server will probably get scored and focus on finding them somewhere else.  Is she protecting a central?  Mission accomplished!  Now you can get at the scoring servers.  And whichever centrals shes not on as well.She has counterplay.  Shes always had counterplay.  People just dont seem to like using it and get hung up on banging their head against her server until they give up.,Netrunner,cv3sgj7,14,t5_2td0c

The simplest answer is who has the most points. When one player is close to winning it puts a lot of pressure on the other player to stay on top of their every move to keep them from getting that last point or two to win. Some runner IDs can subvert this though and certain deck archetypes and good plays can turn the tables really fast.

5237948,0,t3_3mpeny,I think another way of looking at Genetics Pavilion is a way to convert some of your net damage into tempo. Runners quickly find out how hard it is to play cards AND run in the same turn as long a youre putting some damage on them it will take them multiple turns to get back up to a safe number of cards in hand to run again. And with strong numbers the runner also loses a good chunk of change clearing it off the table. It can be hard to quantify the value of these kinds of cards which limit runner possibilities while intrinsically actually doing very little. I think if your corp deck uses constant damagethreat of Snare! to make its plays but can be overrun by a rich runner or one with lots of draw you might find a place for Genetics Pavilion.,Netrunner,cvhd2hu,1,t5_2td0c

However I like the idea that we could see evolved forms of cards like an older Chaos Theory.

I have always loved Shaper on the runner side and Jinteki on corp. However theyve not always loved me back. Im finally reaching a point here after about  years of play or so where Im finally getting into deckbuilding decently the first time off though and only having to adjust and tweak a handful of cards in a deck after play rather than  or scrapping the deck.Lately Ive been experimenting with several Jinteki IDs. Chronos Protocol is really fun but plays very slowly. Too slow I fear for tournament play unless you are very fast taking your turns. Right now Im running Harmony Medtech with x The Future Perfect and x Global Food Initiative and also Mushin no Shin and Project Junebug. The simultaneous scoringkill potential of the deck along with the  card corp deck size is quite nice actually and Ive been pretty happy with early versions of the deck. I have plans to experiment with my Chronos build using Marcus Batty  program trash out of Tennin Institute as well to see if I can add some speed to the concept.On Shaper I love Kit and always have.

6094445,0,t3_3z0lqu,Im by no means a competitive player having only placed middleingly in a few local tournaments over the last couple of years but I do greatly respect this game and admire its design. That said I accept that something like this errata was bound to happen sooner or later and I welcome it. My hope is that it will increase the diversity of the game.uKrystman really nails it with his emperor has no clothes comment. Its a tough thing to accept perhaps but acceptance of some sort of ad hoc correction is nevertheless implicit I feel as long as one already acknowledges that real power differentials in fact exist in the listed cards. That would be hard to deny I think.On the whole I think the cards in this list have been carefully chosen. But I find myself wondering what Willingdone will make of this and in particular whether the notion of a Core . with reprints of the game text of specified cards is no longer something that can seriously be considered.

6171480,0,t3_401tvx,I think its probably the card that becomes the least playable due to the MWL. Like Desperado you want  copies so you can get it out early but unlike Desperado it encourages runners to splash additional cards mainly lucky find to get full value. Also the influencefree or influencelight alternatives are a lot better. If another Dirty Laundry comes along things might change for Kate but I have doubts its even worth it there anymore right now.Taking a look at the MWL as a wholeDesperado You want  but its way better than  influence better than the next best option in every Criminal deck. Will no longer be splashed. Mostly just an unnecessary influence Criminal nerf.PPVP You want  and there are other options that dont cost influence Casts Kati or at least cost less influence than the combination of influence from PPVPs and Lucky Finds Career FairsHotelCasts. Probably unplayable now.Parasite Yog Lady You can often search these up so you effectively are paying far less influence to have more copies of them. All still very playable. Anarchs might start splashing SMC more often and playing less Parasites. I think while the list doesnt hit these as hard as it could have thats fine as these are some of the least problematic cards on the list.SanSan Astro Irreplacably good. Some NBN decks might not need  SanSan or any SanSan but every one will still play  Astro. I think this is the biggest failure of the MWL as it essentially is nerfing NBN as a faction without addressing the problem cards specifically.NAPD Contract This will depend on how much flex influence you have. Exploda Oaktown HB amp Jinteki s Efficiency Committee GFI and Fetal AI all will start to pull heavier loads but NAPD will not disappear. However I expect to see a lot less decks with  copies. Maybe the biggest success of the list will be making other agendas see more play.Clone Chip Largely irreplacable and a lot more than  influence better than Scavenge and Test Run maybe the most overrated card in the game. Expect a lot of people to cut  copies but dont expect it to disappear. However Clot out of Shaper and Anarch gets a lot worse with the influence nerf so expect NBNFA to be totally fine as this will undo a lot of the damage of the  influence nerf. Despite this metaproblem I think Clone Chips inclusion will be a success. You will see less of it but not none of it and whether or not to include each copy is going to be a tough decision unlike Desperado Astro.Eli While nerfing Eli is a good thing I think well still see it splashed a lot due to lack of better options. Like Clone Chip and NAPD you will probably see less than  copies where you used to see . Expect a few more Walls of Static and an uptick in Gallahad and NEXT Silver to complement the dip in Parasite presence. Hopefully a barrier closer in power level to Eli comes out soon because the other options for taxing barriers outside of Weyland are still largely shitty. Maybe of Spiderweb will start to show up places though.,Netrunner,cyr4t6n,8,t5_2td0c

6206557,0,t3_40jmcp,Advancable ice thats actually playable right nowWormhole its a nice chunky code gate that lets you threaten some really scary stuff in the right decks and the reduce rez cost effect is a great way to save money especially with stuff like space camp Which is an issue well get to later.Ice Wall  for  ETR which can maybe get a bit stronger.  Cool.Ice thats somewhat playableFire Wall  for  etr is a little bit less impressive especially because david.Hadrians See fire wallChangelinglycanWendigo Just priced awkwardly but changing the type every time you advance is actually worth a credit to force gear checks.  The effects vary in power and wendigo is mostly useless but might actually be better than people think I had some really great results with it vs single breaker suites where a  for  is very efficient vs the likes of faust or eater.  You can also shut down Mopus and the like not just breakers.Builder technically just support.  You need other ice out then you need this out then you need to click it to move it maybe and in the meantime it does jack if you draw it too early.  For all that its generally just not that great barring some really niche situations and ironically the ice that it helps the best is the ice thats generally the worst.Nebula  for  on a sentry that trashes only is pretty damn hefty but I have sometimes found it to be nice because people think its a wormholeicewall and facecheck it thinking theyll be safe.Searchlight mimic is a thing but a  for  sentry with a double trace means that if they arent breaking it the cost to deal with it goes up by  for every  creditclick...which is almost viable.  At the very least it costs them  to mimic it.Shadow IF you can get tokens on it this is actually somewhat scary especially in weyland.Orion bastard is scary if you somehow get it up and keep it up..ill give it that.  Still its all click heavy.The restAnything that says needs to be rezzed to be advanced is just so stupid bad its not even funny.  They need MUCH stronger effects to justify all the hoops you have to jump through to get them online.Swarm maybe in some magical universe where you can load this up its great but in reality its just too weak.So looking at that Id say a lot of ice is ALMOST playable but theres two big issues. Weyland in general is just weaker right now for a whole slew of reasons and their best identity sun has  synergy with this kind of ice.. The support is all crap.  Builder requires you to have an advanceable ice out draw builder early and then get facechecked. Protocol isnt even that expensive to trash considering how weak it is and how risky one super ice is and does nothing unless youve already got tokens out ON ICE ONLY at which point why do you need to shift them?Space camp actually close to good and will probably be used somewhere.  The problem is . youre almost always better spending the token elsewhere and . you need it to fire way more than  times per game.  Snare is terrifying. Camp not so much unless you fire it more than once.  How do you do that?  Get them to run archives.  How do you get them to run archives?  You play IG.....not weyland.  Your only other option would be throwing an upgrade on it to generate money and then punish them for trashing it but I just dont see weyland getting away with that.Firmware so over  turns you can advance  ice at the risk of running a .  This is MAYBE ok as the  in the right deck but its got a lot of legit competition that doesnt fall flat on its face and theres better options for archer fodder which...doesnt care about your tokens.Satellite grid I just dont see it.  At best you probably pay  to get . Everything about advance ice outside of the morphers screams glacier but its much too slow and not nearly strong enough to actually compete with legit glacier.Because We built it click inefficient as hell and way too specialized.Really what advance ice needs is some sort of support that doesnt blow. Grid and space camp are the ONLY ways to advance your ice in faction at potentially a  to  ratio.  Every other method requires at least  click per token which is just too slow to actually be useful.Edit fringe applications actually wouldve been something  as its clickless if it wasnt draft only.,Netrunner,cyv4axz,1,t5_2td0c

6344673,0,t1_czasnjh,Theres nothing magical about glacier decks.  They just need two ingredients  Ice that is expensive to run and ways to force the runner to run it more than once.  Weyland space ice fills the first requirement really well across all  ice types without spending influence.  So you can spend your influence on frustrating upgrades.Caprice is far from the only way to multiply a server cost.  Ash and Hollywood grid are both perfectly good ways to force them to run more than once per turn and for half the cost of Caprice.And Markus Batty is downright brutal in space ice because nebulas wormholes and orions are all potential targets for program trashing.  The wormholes really open up a lot of potential since you can bounce from them onto any rezzed ice you have anywhere on the board!And yes by themselves Astroid Belt is weaker than fire wall but you can run both.  And astroid belt is better if you have things like firmware upgrades andor constellation protocol advancing it and bringing down the price without spending clicks.,Netrunner,czathta,2,t5_2td0c

NAPDs can be replaced by Vitruvious and some other .That said I think RP lists are pretty strong right now. Replace Eli with Markus is fine and replace NAPD with Fetal AI Philotic or Brainstrust having  agendas is nice since the runner will rarely run your remote with no advanced cards.,Netrunner,czdgq0a,1,t5_2td0c
6387516,0,t3_4359pz,Meh.  I mean yes its a strong AI but there are a LOT of ways to battle it if youre worried about running into one Swordsman Wraparound and Turing are all solid picks.  Yes none of them will fully  stop a determined runner with faust by themselves but theyll add a lot of headache.   Punishing full heaps is a solid play.  Blacklist can force them to deal with a highpriority target that gives them no points and a welltimed Chronos Protocol can be ruinous.   Midrun program trashing shuts things down well.  Batty and Keegan can both force collisions with nasty ice. Due to handsize restrictions apart from some odd Bagbiter decks most Faust decks have a fairly hard limit on how many times they can run per turn simply because they dont have enough cards to get through a scoring server twice.  Things like Ash Red Herrings and Old Hollywood Grid can all force the runner to run multiple times per turn.  And Caprice is an absolute nightmare.   Komainu is kind of funny against it.   Onencounter effects are strong as ever.  Tollbooth and Data Raven are still fairly frustrating to Faust.   Threats like tagpunishment either meatdamage or psychographics are still potent.There are a lot of ways to fight against Faust.  Faust is not the problem here.  What people havent seem to have grasped yet is that the new meta is NOT faust steamrolls everything.  The new meta is simply thisRunners who have time to set up can get into a pretty major server basically for free at least once per turn.Look around at current runner decks.  Faust is one piece but so is Security Nexus.  So are multithreaders.  And theres a ton of tech coming down the line to battle defensive upgrades too.  We had our fun with glaciers for a bit and this is the pendulum swinging the other way.  If you want to protect your servers you can no longer just throw down some expensive ice and upgrades and expect it to be impregnable any more.Which to be clear is a good thing for the game.  It encourages interaction.  It encourages bluffing and traps and strategies other than just build a giant wall and hide behind it.But faust is not the problem here.  The problem is just that corp servers are easier to penetrate than ever.

Spending an agenda is spending political capital but you are not burning that with the ICE creators but rather the systems of government and control that let you install the ICE in the first place.Archer and Enforcer are essentially military grade ICE that you wouldnt normally be able to install.  But lobby the right people complete that Veterans Program and things become easier.  Its the equivalent of Corps buying tanks or fighter jets in todays world.  While the role of government and state control is dramatically reduced in the world of Android it still exists and procurement and installation of such ICE requires greasing the wheels of the militaryindustrialcomplex.   This is why Archer its such a good fit for Weyland.   Note that this is different to the Illicit ice which is just plain illegal or at least on the fringes of the law but reasonably easy to procure.

Its ok that you dont have DampD yet.  Is Caprice in a T pack? Cut the  Snare!s and a Tollbooth for  Caprices. Is Architect in a T pack? If so Id cut the final Tollbooth for a pair of those.

6910479,0,t3_4adhyw,Spoilers in this post but since the thread itself has been spoilered Im not going to bother marking themI have been saying this for a whileWe are moving firmly into a place where corps can no longer expect that a server is going to be safe forever no matter how much they spend on ice and upgrades.  A dedicated runner will be able to get in.  Faust and Dvd were the leading edge of this trend and it is only continuing.But even as runners reach unprecedented levels of breakin tricks corps themselves are reaching unprecedented levels of being able to mess with you.  Look at recent additions like Markus and Keegan or the breaking news combo.  Look at Voter Suppression.  Look at Zealous Judge.  Look at Salems Hospitalty.  Look at Ibrahim Salem himself.Were clearly moving past the corp passively defends paradigm into a world where corps can just mess with the runner directly and break their stuff.  And will probably need to do so in order to deal with runners hyperefficient rigs.Ill admit to being a little nervous about this shift just because it feels major and I love netrunner as Ive grown to know it.

The full rule is that an ability can only be used if its effect can be determined to have the potential to change the game state without regard to paying the abilitys cost and without regard to any other cards triggers.So the question for whether or not Jackson can be used is regardless of Jackson being removed from the game will shuffling  to  cards from Archives into RampD change the game state? Unless  RampD and Archives are both empty then the answer to this question will always be yes because shuffling RampD is a change in game state no matter how many cards in Archives are put back into RampD. The question for Artist Colony is regardless of forfeiting an agenda will searching for and installing something from the stack and then shuffling the stack change the game state?

7508410,0,t1_d2vmtq3,The term Glacier basically applies to any deck that tries to score the old fashioned way by installing an agenda letting it sit through the runners turn protected by ice or defensive upgrades and scoring it in the next turn. This is probably the most basic corp strategy in netrunner. You build fat centrals and a single scoring remote preferably stacking everything  or  ice deep and wait for the runner to bankrupt themselves trying to get accesses at which point youre safe to score.It works especially well in HB because they have assets like Adonis Campaign that you can plop in your scoring remote and bluff it as a  agenda. The runner basically has to check it typically at a decent cost and will turn up empty handed.Something like This with or without the Biotic Labors you could swap them for more ice if you wanted to be more glaciery,Netrunner,d2vo2d9,1,t5_2td0c

7894758,0,t3_4nezlm,Id say it depends on how you wanna approach the game. If you wanna immediately dive into the deep end of the meta and be able to get up to speed ASAP then a full card pool will definitely help that youll be able build anything you read about online and pick up the competitive essentials quickly while leaving the rest in the binder until you go exploring. Sure therell be more to take onboard at once but if youre reading lots online youll still be digesting it all one deck at a time. If youre not planning on doing lots of reading however and prefer to experiment with decks I expect this would be overwhelming.If you wanna take it a slower pace however but still plan on doing lots of online reading you could save a bit of money by just cherrypicking the cards and packs you need to build the decks that sound most fun and interesting to you. One of my friends has done this and he has a couple of playable decks that he knows pretty well but not many options for expanding or changing them without buying more stuff. Fewer cards  easier to get to know your card pool though so again if tinkering is your thing this might be more manageable.If immediately having the newest stuff and being involved in all the bleedingedge deckcrafting doesnt bother you you will get a lot of mileage out of just core and deluxes. Lots of cards to play with but not a full collection and the deluxes have deck suggestions on their inserts too which might give you some inspiration. Its also a popular route for new players to take so youll find lots of discussion online about what you can do with core  deluxes.Ended up waffling a bit but hope some of that is useful.

8044522,0,t3_4pds0m,Runners are terrifying and can withstand most any blow  if you give them a ton of free time unmolested to get their entire rig up and have a ton of cash.They key with any good speed bump is that you need to hit them  when they arent fully prepared for everything  when theyre already stretched thin the speed bump can break the camels back.  There is no even if the runner is fully set up and has infinite cash doing  will stop them for long enough to win!  you need to be on your gameplan from the beggining.The answer to a lot of questions in netrunner is tempo  force the runner to be doing things before they want to.  Force them to run on servers before theyre fully set up.  Now they spend everything to get the one right breaker then need to get in  only to have it trashed.Plinking away with net damage is the same way  just like trashing one program doing  net damage wont be a big hurdle to a set up full hand runner.   But doing the damage early when they might need those cards or doing it when they dont have a full hand and cant draw and play the breakers they need and run or when they dont have their other protection online  thats strong.Also strong is comboing effects.  A lot of runners can get by with one trashed program.  But three? thats hard to get around.  Again similar to the damage thing where one net damage doesnt really hurt unless maybe that advanced card is a junebug?Timing is a factor too  if you trash a breaker but they have a full turn to recover before you score they can manage that.  But if you trash a breaker midnear end of run Marcus batty or keegan lane or etc and they cant get through but they need that breaker back THIS TURN or you score but they already spent a lot trying to get in the first time well its a lot harder for them.  Bonus points if you trash the sentry breaker right after theyve comitted to facing a sentry that trashes programs but before theyve broken it so now they have to get two programs back immediately.also you can use effects your opponent is weak against.    If theyve got clone chips out that doesnt help vs cards like WillotheWisp.  If theyve got a lot of recursion i hear rezzing Blacklist immediately after trashing a breaker does good work.Not a ton of decks run a lot of clone chips many use just some or none especially since MWL.  If youve got a runner dedicated to recursion running three clone chips and other ways to get stuff back program trashing probably isnt the way to win your deck better not be all in on that you better be able to beat them another way.  You cant just rely on one mechanic to get you through or that wylsidenet shield runner will beat  your little net damage per turn deck that torchstudy guide player will beat your all code gates deck that player playing three plascretes with forger will beat your sea source deck.Also scorch decks are down in popularity.

8501663,0,t3_4w5xto, vocal minority... the complaints are valid for the ubercompetitive set but for a new or casual player theres still just SO much game here. For those hardcores who have been in the game for a while its going through the growing pains that all expanding games go through at some point old cards with new life balancing creep versus horizontal design how to mitigate broken combos a very deep lingoshorthand etc and even with that being said its still not all that bad if youve seen how crippling thats been for other games development. Complaining here isnt so much a problem with the game but a reflection of the players passion and commitment to wanting the game to be great.That being said this game like all other CCGTCGLCG card games is very much a community game. If you live in a small town without an established community it will be frustrating to get anybody else to buy into what is essentially a lifestyle game where youre having fun but dedicating both your gaming time and time away from the table to deckbuilding reading forums listening to podcasts etc... its a pretty deep Rabbit Hole. For those who have the time and energy to explore it its very rewarding. If you dont have a person to play with regularly it can be a very frustrating experience. If youve got a group youre jumping in with or a group of friends all interested in getting in at once? Have at it... youll quickly see that it compares very favorably to a lot of competitors both in depth of play and in personal experiences with other players.,Netrunner,d649eig,77,t5_2td0c

8689116,0,t3_4yzwho,Lets analyze it from a cold harsh economical perspective.Having a trash cost of creditc this is comparable to a PAD Campaign in Jinteki and I dont think any other Corp would ever want to import this anyways  if you could defend a Hyoubu you could defend a PAD so the question is which one youd rather have. Hyoubu has two less in rez cost so that already puts it ahead of its competitor.PAD reliably gains you one cred at the start of each Corp turn. Since we are not considering this from a psychological perspective the earnings from Hyoubu can be considered random with  chance of   or creditc assuming the play psi game with dice model. This gives Hyoubu the same net gain as PAD with a creditc head start  but it is contingent on the Runner triggering a Psi game during their turn. While extremely Psiheavy decks hello Nisei division may use a lot of Psi ice this is still not enough to ensure that a Psi game is played every turn  the Runner may simply not run a given turn or they may breakbypass all Psi ice encountered anyways although the odd Psychic Field and Future Perfect could still trigger Hyoubu.There are a few cards that trigger Psi games during the Corps turn  Voter Intimidation Cerebral Casts and indirectly An Offer You Cant Refuse so it is possible to slightly make up for the lost creds that you did not get from Runner turns without Psi games but the outlook here is fairly bleak  in the long run it is almost unthinkable that Hyoubu would generate more creds than PAD. And of course it is not like PAD is anywhere near an ideal econ card anyways  so Hyoubu ends up being surprisingly or maybe not surprisingly disappointing from an economic perspective. Its even unique so you cant stack multiples for benefit unlike PAD.It still doesnt let you do Psi games at creditc either which I think Nisei Division would really have appreciated. So all around Im unconvinced.Now psychologically? Great card if your econ is strong enough to afford some inefficient cards to psyche out the Runner go ahead.,Netrunner,d6rrmna,7,t5_2td0c

8967488,0,t3_533e8p,Im really impressed at how well put together this pack feels. Most of the potential ridiculousness of effects is balanced by how hard the requirements are to pull off. Here are some thoughtsProletariat  I wonder if c is too much but the corp can play around this pretty easily. He benefits from the corp using Jackson Howard to reduce agenda density and by not being Criminal he has to pay inf if he wants those tasty Fisk Investment Seminars. Also works with the Anarch Bad Pub cards and Itenerant Protesters. Id totally play this.Rehash  Id reduce the cost to  and make it instead of accessing personally but its decently balanced either way.Skeletons In The Closet  Probably the easiest way to land bad pub in the game and thats not a bad thing. Id be a little concerned about extraclick shenanigans allowing playing more than one of these in a turn though.Archives Blitz  Feels a little week. Maybe two cards for each point?Asset Freeze  Perfectly themed in faction. Love it.HQ Blitz  A more conditional cheaper legwork. Wouldnt see much play but Leela would love it.Resonance Cascade  This should be more expensive. A corp playing a strong remote that you never run can see their agenda and entire server wiped due to slightly weaker centrals. c?RampD Blitz  Cheaper more situational makers eye. I guess maybe Kit plays this? Or smoke?Cashing In  Its like Day Job but you have to make three runs instead of spend three clicks. Im not sure this needs an influence cost given how hard it is to pull off? Or maybe it should be Criminal.ZeroSum  I see some potential troubles with this and things like Offer you Cant Refuse interacting if only from a memory perspective. Maybe At the start of your turn if there are any power counters on ZeroSum remove  power counter and gain click and the subroutine becomes add one power counter to Zero SumWendy Lovelace  Love it though it might be a tad expensive. If only it didnt get blanked by Rumor Mill PFrame Perfect  Its like caprice but one time use and scales with how well defended the server is. Alternately if you wanted to replace caprice more directly you could make the cost trash a piece of ice protecting this server instead of selftrashing. Makes it worse earlier in the game and stronger as a closer.Growth  Its that one Biotech ability on a card basically. Might be too direct a replacement?Log Review  One click potentially four advancements. Much easier to pull off the fast advance with than Psychographics and more expensive than biotic labor since it can easily FA a  or . The trash cost seals the deal on this not being game breaking. Love it.Stack Exchange  Initial impression was way too strong but then I remembered Old Hollywood Grid exists and rarely gets used. This is probably fine then PWasatch Grid  At the price of c Id at least like to see a trash cost of  but seems well thought out otherwise.Block By Block  I know the idea is die or I score an agenda but Id rather see  meat damage so the decision for the runner is well more of a decision. I also see some hilarious plays of Draw install Block by Block where the installed card isnt even an Atlas but a melange or something.Exeunt  Yup thats the trap Weyland needs. Nice.Hard Reset  Maybe too strong in HB. This forces another run which is another click spent and Strongbox as a parallel costs  to rez. Add an influence cost perhaps?Side Project  This is the sort of waytooweak card I would build stupid shell games around. Install an Edge of the World. They dont bite? Install this instead and start advancing so they think the EoW is a Caprice. Maybe just so its not too painful to advance make it gain c for every  counters?

Im experimenting with using Government Takeover and x Vanity Project so the deck only has  agendas out of  cards total. The primary plan is to build up sufficiently thick servers as to make multiple runs implausible. Then get a scoring window by baiting a costly run. The secondary plan is to nuke the runner with Punitive Counterstrikes if they do steal an agenda. The problems right now are as follow Lacks the economy to ensure one successful trace for Counterstrike let alone two if needed.  If the runner gets a lucky early access before you can kill with Counterstrike future draws of Counterstrike are dead draws.  A lot of the advancable ICE is pretty bad.

9668428,0,t3_5dhvyi,Im going to loosely use the term degenerate here to name cards that warp the existing card pool with special attention to the larger design space in what I believe are an extremely negative way. Whizzard  credits to trash stuff each turn is obscene and completely warps the value of assetstrashables around his existence. Im nervous that FFG went too far in designing new assetsupgrades around his stats since even with Whizz in the game now asset spam is still super strong. Whats gonna happen with asset spam when he rotates!?Breaking News This is mostly a problem because of the strong cards that combo off of it EoI ASI Closed Accounts BOOM!  etc.... I think Breaking News is the core issue because as a  it makes it too easy to stick a runner with two tags and clicks to spare. Especially in the fast advance faction. Its just too easily abused to give runners instant tags. It makes any powerful effect that wants to play off those usually more difficult to land tags potentially too good. Limit  per deck my vote so its less consistent or make it a  so it actually has to sit for a turn and get FAd to hit and everything around it is fine.Accelerated Diagnostics  Power Shutdown This is less a degenerate card than a degenerate pair. On their own these cards are fine including AD with the new Jinteki op. Together they break the need for the corp to actually find and set up an operation combo and just make it automatic. This is less OP than the other two examples rather I think it leads to negative play experiences. People will probably disagree with me on this one.CTM Because who decided the tag should be unavoidable? WHAT IS THAT BUSINESS!? WHY?! That disables so many ways to use the current card pool Jesminder... NACH... to counter the ID ability while also restricting future ways to design around the ID ability. Assets also tend to already be balanced around their reztrash cost ratio so anything that warps that too much eg. Whizzard or like making assets essentially take a click and two credits extra to trash the first time each turn... unless you counter it with the only card that can Salsette Slums because the tag is otherwise unavoidable WHY can lead to things like asset spam becoming too difficult for most runners to deal with oh hey surprise!.Im not salty,Netrunner,da4u42b,14,t5_2td0c

10034407,0,t1_dbfgoos,Breaker AI Baba Yaga str  gains all of the paid abilities of breakers that are installed on it which are yog faerie inti amp refractorYog  Faerie allow breaking ice for free basically and Baba Yaga will allow you to use the pump abilities of any of their breakers. So stealth will get you  str or c will get you a perm  str for the run but also you can use any of the breakers as they are. Inti largely gets pumped by other breaker abilities when necessary but itll break most things for free. Also all of the breakers aside from switchblade yog amp  baba yaga cost very little to install.Net Mercur allows using ghost runner credits to basically use refractor as much as needed to get through stuff. The current meta doesnt believe in barriers because of paper clip which is extremely exploitable. Code Gates are played a lot so yog which can be pumped if necessary is extremely efficient. And Faerie will handle any extreme problems pretty easily. This deck can break archer for  stealth credit.Net mercur also allows you to get a  credit discount cost on trashing things because it puts its credit back on itself.Aesops can turn any of the resources which haeyly efficiently installs into burst econ at the start of turn. Reaver which is in the bin allows the aesops to give you a draw each turn. Also many of the resources will give you a card when trashed. Beth usually draws you a card several times a game so the deck sort of has wyld pancakes going on.Gauntlet helps the mu and puts HQ pressure. Every ice you fully break allows you to access an aditional card.Since the deck is resource intensive it runs armitage amp sacrificial construct. Sac Con is often aesops fodder but it also protects your rig from batty and other shenanigans. Rabbit Hole can be dripped into play off of the workshop or installed in a single click for . This makes for an ok aesop drip if you need it later but can save you a lot of money vs CTM or other trace strong strategies.On the other side of the table you see a corp flailing to make super deep servers that can deal with the econbreaking and they managed to get to  points so it was a closish game. By making tags a threat Hayley had to go slow to make sure it didnt sucumb to a number of tag based threats closed accounts allseeingi boom and exchange of information.In the end the runner got the remote lock and won off of archives since the corp was unwilling to hold agendas in hand without any ice and the threat of gauntlet. The RampD interface probably also allowed a lock that went beyond the remote lock and pressured more resources onto another server.The game was entirely janky. It went on forever both players drew through their decks and it came down to bluffing and pitting one large game state against another to see who came out on top.

I dont think Cybernetics is a good ID or a strong strategy and I find the smaller deck size actually works against the ability much like Khan.In order for you leverage Curfew with Cybernetics youre looking at as the OP said throwing in x of them to keep them around  youre now at  cards. Agenda suite wise you need to run Defective Brain Chips if you want to do never advance youre looking at x  agendas so thats  more cards to get to  AP  throw in maybe a x GFI to round out your points and now you have  deck slots left for economy ice and some other way to reduce handsize... and now finding room for Best Defense in order to counter a metaheavy card. For the Corp it doesnt do much other than counter Obelus since there arent really other hand size increases in fashion right now so a number of games its utility is going to be much lower. Even if you slot it if a player is smart or gets wind of it they can try to ride at  tags and have  hand size which will make reaching a  hand size nearly impossible for your deck to manage.Specifically when the OP seemed to be asking in the context of the current meta. Looking at Brain damage as a whole I feel like handsize increases are under priced compared to handsize reducers which does mechanically make sense but it also means that basing a deck around reducing hand size is fighting an uphill battle.,Netrunner,dbie4kc,7,t5_2td0c

10761225,0,t3_5tv2z1,The idea that the new Weyland ID kills recursion seems a little drastic. One minute people scream that Sifrparasitedejavu basically makes ice redundant and destroyed glacier perhaps buries it under a ton of concrete as it was already not in a good way. Now we have an ID that deals with it. Rumour Mill blanks great defensive upgrades we all screamed when it was released. Is it the card we wanted or asked for no. But has it destroyed Netrunner no. As many people have mentioned the removing of a card from the game happens once per turn. You still have cutlery you still have at least three parasites to use. Guess what if you install two parasites in a turn you can trash two ice and only one of those parasites is removed. There are ways around this. Not forgetting you can bait a corp to use their ability. Same old thing trashes on the lamb trashes sports hopper trashes temujin trashes. A corp doesnt have a simple choice just to blow away your deck. Maybe they want one of them gone too?When you have the incredible recursion that anarch has now and shaper however they arent so dominant and the complaints people have aimed at that faction it makes sense we have something which makes a runner have to play around it.There are just so many ways to play around the ID that the world hasnt come to a grinding halt. Sure you cant run through with gay abandon blowing away curtain walls and Fairchilds knowing youll just grab back those parasites and do it all over again. You can still do it three times MINIMUM.

Theres a lot of directions its pulling in right now Scorched Earth Psychic Field and Snare for potential flatlines Ash and Archer for a secure scoring remote Medical Breakthrough for fast advance shenanigans. But a lot of those cards are  or ofs in the deck and youre not really committing to any strategies.In particular theres a few antisynergies as a result. Mental Health Clinics make it hard to secure the flatline and cards that tax or otherwise care about the runners credits like Ash and Pup are somewhat invalidated by you giving them credits for free with Medical Research Fundraiser.So Id suggest focusing on one or two primary strategies and committing harder to those. Drop some of the random of cards that dont further your chosen strategies and strongly consider playing  copies of the cards that do. And whatever your strategy is you probably want to be playing  Hedge Funds.One more note about the kill strategy the singleton Scorched Earth makes sense it might take people by surprise and youll get a few lucky wins if runners hit a snare and dont think they need to clear the tag right away. But the Traffic Accident seems a little harder to justify how is the runner ever going to be doubletagged on your turn? As soon as they see youre playing tagging ice I cant imagine they wont think to clear them so Traffic Accident will never be playable.

I often have two or three decks per side built with proxies for cards that I want in more than one of them. Obviously for tournaments I have to make sure I have a proxyfree deck but the rest of the time no one cares.It probably helps that FFG doesnt really have a program to run casual nights or sanction stores so they dont have much control over this. And the majority of players who use proxies do actually own all the cards its just that theyre building multiple decks so Im not sure how much FFG would actually want to crack down on it even if they had some means to do so. I dont think they could convince anyone to buy duplicates but if they tried they might annoy people who currently buy all the cards into quitting. Having the game seen as something where you only need one copy of each expansion is good for it.Admittedly it would be impractical to have sixty decks built at once but I dont really see the appeal of that myself.
