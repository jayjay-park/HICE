Though there are indications that as so often in Ishiguros work the narrator is living in the past to an unhealthy degree refusing to acknowledge the changes that time has wrought when we learn that he has been invited as part of a misguided even cruel attempt to patch up his friends disintegrating marriage we think we understand the rough pattern the story is likely to takewhich makes it all the more surprising when Ishiguro instead plunges into the truly strange. The surprises in the story are a substantial part of its pleasures so the less said the better but the deftness with which Ishiguro moves from the world of ordinary human motivations to pathology and comicyet troublingabsurdity is stunning as is the resolution of the story which is unexpectedly calm kind and even generous.A similar narrative emerges in An Artist of the Floating World. Ono is another narrator haunted by the past. His wife is dead following a bombing raid that destroyed large sections of their house. His son dies fighting the Chinese. Ono does not dwell explicitly on these personal losses.By turns tragic comic and absurd this is a collection that has repertoire variation and resonance in abundance. Dr James Procter  For an indepth critical review see Kazuo Ishiguro by Cynthia F. Wong nd edition Northcote House  Writers and their Work Series.Like most of Ishiguro s narrators the reliability of Ono s recollection is suspect. His reminiscences are usually qualified Of course that is all a matter of many years ago now and I cannot vouch that those were my exact words that morning. In many instances he is forced to revise what he remembers often grudgingly. I am not one of those who are afraid to admit to the shortcomings of past achievements Ono says near the end. The themes that fascinate me as a writer are present in this novel regret guilt the malleability of memory the pains of ageing solitude loneliness.In A Pale View of Hills Ishiguro s first novel a widow in postwar Japan recalls her life in Nagasaki. Characteristically Ishiguro tells the story without once mentioning the Bomb just as the Suez Crisis of  silently stands behind The Remains of the Day as the novel s present time setting. In his second novel An Artist of the Floating World Masuji Ono the protagonist also reflects on the events shaping his life. Ono spends his days trying to negotiate the marraigae of his younger daughter visiting former haunts and playing with his young grandson..   ,forsakenvirtues,cx9zbr0,1,t5_2wj9n
