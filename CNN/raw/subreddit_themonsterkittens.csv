606432,0,t3_21143q,This is awesome! It flows really nicely and still has the feeling from the original song while its not an exact copy. I also love how it doesnt have an upfront in your face drop.

721173,0,t3_22eenl,The kick might be a wee bit TOO loud IMO. The clap doesnt even compare and comes off as super weak. Fills and hihat patterns help in bringing in variation in the intro. The song becomes a bit too messy at  but is awesome again after the drop. ,themonsterkittens,cgm919o,1,t5_2z7d8
726158,0,t3_22gf8o,I have this same problem. A few things I do are to SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING other than FL. Also open task manager and go to processes and right click ilbridge.exe and highlight priority and set it to high. Note youll need to do this every time you use FL Also in FL Studio go to the tools section and under macros click purge unused audio clips and then also click select unused channels and delete those. Lastly still under macros select switch smart disable for all plugins. These are all the things I do and it normally frees up enough CPU for me to layer two or three more synths than I normally can.EDIT Im going to be getting a new laptop this summer after my tax returnsopen house money yes Im graduating this year so more time for producing!

989169,0,t3_25e6sk,The biggest benefit of using Macs is that their builtin audiochip is incredibly good! On Windows PCs youll have to use an audiointerface to achieve the same result.Personally I use both Windows my gamingstudio setup and Mac Air for schooluse. Ableton runs absolutely fine on both and production wise its the exact same experience. Im not limited or ahead on any one platform. The Macbook Air is plenty capable of running Ableton to its fullest  a lot of VSTs.A lot of people including me prefers Macs because of the build quality and the feel of the system.In pro studios Macs are the norm because the standard DAWs run great on Mac and Logic is exclusive to the Mac. The standard for DAWs in pro studios are generally Logic Cubase and Pro tools. Sometimes youll find Ableton in a pro studio but rarely FL.The now outdated Mac Pro was very popular in music production because of its powerful Xeon CPU and the inherent stability of the OSX OS. ,themonsterkittens,chgq4ya,1,t5_2z7d8

2681429,0,t1_cn79vej,Music theory is the number one most important thing. If youre trying to make music without music theory its like trying to bake a cake without eggs. Chord progressions songwriting song structure etc. These are all so imperative to making music.And also dont ask other people if you should finish the song just do. Just finish it. Have us critique your finished piece of music and thats when youll really improve. ,themonsterkittens,cn8l09l,3,t5_2z7d8

Not specifically to you the high noise could be pitched down but isnt too bad but saying it was intentional is something people do here a lot kind of annoying.,themonsterkittens,cqurgkc,1,t5_2z7d8
