542743,0,t3_20bu69,Hey! Here is a post i made in regards to an idea i had for starting a guild! Please take a look and let me know if its something you would be interested in! i dont mind if you plan to recordstream. However it is no community! just a fresh start! anyways take a look if you like.i can also answer any questions you might have.,WSGuilds,cg1ysm5,1,t5_2wfs9
789131,0,t3_22ba93,GT and ExInferno are LFM!    Check us out at www.exinferno.com. Click forumswildstar  NA or EU and see if any of the raids match your needs. If so then maybe we can make some magic happen. Hope to hear from you soon. There are several raid groups but here is a description of mine.Welcome to your second job. Progression and pride will be your salary. Camaraderie will be your bonus. Hardcore progression mm. Casual Farming mm.       Schedule MonTuesWed pmam EST  pmpm PST pmpm MST pmam CST         We only get  hours a night for a total of  hours a week to do work. We have to maximize efficiency of our time if we want to be the best.        Loot Loot council. Loot will be distributed in a way that promotes the raid as a whole for progression.          Be the best I need people who strive to be the best. I dont expect anyone to be the best out of the box but I do want personal progression to be something my fellow gamers want.          Be there I need my fellow gamers to be  focused on raiding when those invites go out. Just having a toon in the raid spamming a button while watching Netflix is not going to work.          Am I ready to raid? Being ready to raid means studying your class before the raid studying the bosstrash encounters before the raid knowing both specs your class can use before the raid having consumables ready before the raid gear repaired before the raid having your gear runed before for the raid emptying your bladdercolon before the raid having fooddrinks IRL before the raid and getting rid of distractions before the raid.           Am I hurting my team? Impeding the raids use of time is what can hurt the team the most. Whether it is being late not knowing the fights AFKing getting food going to the bathroom not paying  attention not following instructions not striving for personal growth and not being a team player it all comes to impeding the raids use of effective time to competitively progress.            Is there a test? My officers and I plan on seeing what each player is capable of and will run a  man to do just that. Sounds stressful right? Nah it will be a blast.           Chat sever Mumble         Progression raids both  will be pushed hard and additional time might be requested during these raids to remain a competitive guild. While content is on farm the schedule will naturally be shortened due to lack of content.          Currently in need ofHealersCastermelee DPSTanksGT is also willing to male alliances with other  man raid groups for  man content focused on competitive progression. Guilds dont need a merge they can simple create a circle. ,WSGuilds,cgtz85a,1,t5_2wfs9

889382,0,t3_24azq0,While we are going to have groups doing raid progression competitive PvP warplots etc. we also have many members who are just going to be casually playing so you wont have trouble finding people with the same mindset. If you have any questions feel free to message me and Ill do my best to answer. ,WSGuilds,ch5dk5x,1,t5_2wfs9
889426,0,t1_cgshv71,I have a few questions.  First what are your expected raid times?  I understand that any answer will be tentativeSecond Have you decided to go PvP or PvE yet? I see that it was TBD  Third are you expecting to do  or  man raiding?  Last how serious are you all about raiding?,WSGuilds,ch5dqnw,3,t5_2wfs9

936708,0,t3_24th2p,With Open Beta coming up soon now is the time for new WildStar players to become guilded by applying to VIIThe lists of accomplishments the Applicants and Members of VII has is impressive.But what if your accomplishments are not as recent or not as impressive as what you think may be needed to be considered for a highly competitive WildStar raiding team?The answer is VIIs Open Beta Open Recruitment You are still going to have to apply You will still have to provide us with your experiences. You are still going to have to make a commitment of three nights per week while meeting your own personal goals outside of raids to maintain your performance in raids. You will still be tested once raiding is underway. You may still be cut or set as a second string bench warmer. WildStar is for a decidedly hardcore audience of MMO player. However most of the competitive raiders we knew have long since resigned from EQ EQ WoW and RIFT. With prominent guilds like ltvodkagt and ltExodusgt merging and folding and the last expansion of WoW raiding with Mists of Panderia relegating ltParagongt to a  man raid force it is evident that the pool of competitive players available for all MMOs has experienced attrition far beyond the scope of feasibility for incumbent competitive guilds to lend support for more than what their rosters are already committed.What this gives you as a player and VII as a guild is opportunity.When opportunity knocks... Despite the idioms opportunity doesnt knock at your door let alone only once. You have to kick Opportunitys door down and clear the room. Fortunately the doors to WildStar are wide open. We have busted out the windows repelled down the walls and have set up camp outside as we prepare to burn it to the ground and build our own monument with a plaque that readsVII Come as you are. Emerge as a legend.Let me be the first to congratulate you on our success.SincerelyDevonGuild Leader of VIIP.S. We Da Best!,WSGuilds,charby5,1,t5_2wfs9
962614,0,t3_254klh,An interesting take on the LFG stuff ive read lately. I would argue that us lot over at IronPulse fit the bill except everyone do as they like! is a little limited in that we arent looking for members that like to RP. We just arent the right group for people looking for that. Aside from that though were looking for people that want to play games not people that love drama or to cause issues just want a fun atmosphere of friendly people playing games. If youre at all interested check our site out www.ironpulse.comor I can PM you the Ts details and you can ask me some questions or get a feel for us. Or our Post on the wsguilds subreddit  EUDominionPvX ltIronPulsegt  Friendly established community with a semihardcore atmosphere.,WSGuilds,chdpidi,1,t5_2wfs9
969614,0,t3_256ww3,Hi there! Looks like you have some other offers on your plate but its hard to know exactly what you are drawn to so Ill throw MadCast Gaming out there as well. Wiki Page and website www.madcastgaming.com.Firstly you know what you want so lets not waste your time. Heres why we might NOT be a good fit for you Each person is very welcome to come and game with us if they can follow the MadCast Code of Conduct aka dont be a dick to people. If your group is interested in applying for Full Membership to the community however each person must be evaluated individually no batch transfers. Applying for membership is not hard but to succeed each person must be active and demonstrate interest in the community.  MadCast does not transfer leadership positions. Im not sure if youre looking to kick back and just play or if youre invested in leading. This does not mean you cannot become a WildStar admin for MadCast by any means however you must apply for membership and then apply for adminship. If you share our community values and demonstrate strong active leadership skills you will become an admin. We are always looking for people who can make our community a better place. The process in total however takes  days from applying for membership to applying for adminship. If you were to apply now that would put you up for an admin position Ranking Full Member right around the time we start raiding. Please dont feel rushed into anything but I just want to be up front. MadCast will be rolling Exiles on Olyssia which is not a PvP server. At this time we are working to build our WildStar branch and focusing on PvE endgame Raiding. We are very open to PvP if our members demonstrate interest and we can build the structure and numbers to run serious PvP.Why we might be a good fit for you MadCast has been around since . We have  current Full Members across several games. We have the experience to be successful. This does not mean all games we try succeed but it does mean weve managed to avoid the drama ship and keep people engaged in our community as their interests and lives change. We will have a serious Raid Team Monday Tuesday and Thursday evenings EST. Start time TBD but probably around  PM. At this time we are not accepting applications for this or building a roster. We know people will be hopping around looking for the right fit at launch and we prefer to wait until our members are close to being able to raid. We have cool people. We dont have an age requirement because honestly thats a cop out and we are serious about individually evaluating peoples maturity and fit for our community. We have many adults with careers families university etc. Most of our members are great friends attending meet ups sending flowers to someone in the hospital birthday presents weddings etc. We take gaming seriously but our community is extremely important to us.Shoot me a message if you have more questions. I am a senior admin at MadCast so Id be happy to explain more to you about our values and the process of becoming an administrator in our community. ,WSGuilds,chei6k7,1,t5_2wfs9

1002420,0,t1_chi81cg,The obvious reason is because SWTOR does not have the player base WoW does. With that aside we were not always this good. We learned a lot and went through growing pains. Once we started completing things we started to attract the more skilled players in guilds that did not have everyone at the same level. After that it kind of snowballed and we are where we are today.,WSGuilds,chi8elv,1,t5_2wfs9
1007770,0,t3_25lmg5,Hi Domo I wanted to add Critical to your list of potential guilds.We are looking to do end game pvp in a.semi hardcore raid schedule.

1065360,0,t3_26ael9,It only just dawned on me what  was about.. WStar.. Facepalm. If you dont mind being in a group with slowpokes like me ironpulse sounds like it might be a good match for you. Were an EU group mostly older people with jobs and limited gaming time so evenings is the main active area. Were planning to go Dominion on a PvP server and do a bit of the PvP stuff whilst having a schedule for Raiding.  So we get to do a bit of everything hopefully. If youre interested i can PM you our TS details and you can say hi ask some questions. Or you can checkout our site www.ironpulse.com,WSGuilds,chpdwy7,1,t5_2wfs9
1069940,0,t3_26d52w,We are a worldwide NAEU cross faction guildcommunity with over  members. We are focused on PvE and PvP content. In WildStar our aim is getting the server firsts on Dominion and Exiles in PvE raiding. We are already deep into the prepwork for raiding with more than  raid groups across both factions in our NA division. We are currently expanding our ranks in the EU division. In PvP we are currently setting up teams for Rated Battlegrounds Arenas and Warplots with the focus on becoming a force in competitive gaming. Our aim is to establish a unified guild circle with the objective of working together on endgame content for instance organizing massive guild vs guild Warplot battles and M raiding. Apart from being a hardcore guild we are also a casual guild because we understand that sometimes real life does comes first. In the end we want all our members to enjoy the game and what it has to offer at launch no matter if you are hardcore or a casual gamer.NA Progression Raiding Exile S.H.I.E.L.D.
