373444,0,t1_cfjcipp,I know some stores in the states will do a gallon type deal. The aquariums are really great and way better than most commercial hamster cages which are usually way too small. I got mine online for  so try there as well. But thanks.  feel free to message me if you need any help I used to have a Syrian and went through the wheel too small issue. The cage was too small as well but I was too young to realise it especially when the pet stores make it seem like it will be a great house for your ham. ,hamsters,cfjh0sz,2,t5_2sjcj
404063,0,t3_1ypqwt,Try and return it if you can as it probably cost you a fair bit of money and you can get hold of small temporary cages for crazy cheap. And no youre not a bad person everyone makes mistakes and its really good that you realised the cage problem early The one I have for my syrian at the moment is this alaska cage from zooplus. Im assuming youre US though so Im not sure whats on the market for you. Ive found this kind of cage brilliant. If you want the best try and find a good cage of about xcm in size big deep tray and strong bars. You then have loads of space to add your own levels houses and toys for them. Also note that itll need to fit at least a  inch wheel inside though my ham has to have the inch silent spinner as she outgrew her last one.Hope this helps a bit ,hamsters,cfmnbhs,1,t5_2sjcj

He was amazing and it happened so suddenly woke up and he was gone when he had been acting normal and healthy the night and days before hand and far sooner than I would have liked.

959516,0,t3_253amo,Running on the wheel is a pretty great sign.  Make sure hes eating drinking pooping and sleeping okay.  If you have a scale that measures in grams you should weigh him now to see if he gains or loses any weight in the next few days.  Try to watch how he walks to see if hes limping.  Check his toes every once in a while to make sure they arent turning blueblack from lack of oxygen.  Check his tail to make sure its straight tail breaks are common in hamster falls.But honestly hes probably fine.,hamsters,chdctpx,2,t5_2sjcj

2033024,0,t3_2i0eya,Hamsters love chewing cardboard and using it as bedding mine does it with toilet roll tubes. They will nest where they want mine took all her bedding from the house and dug a hole in the sawdust in the corner and put it in there instead. They will make it where they want. My hamster loves to dig also and bury herself under bedding so i make it extra deep. Do not use the fluffy cotton wool bedding ever my old dwarf broke his leg on it ,hamsters,cky8pvp,1,t5_2sjcj

2064771,0,t3_2igyvx,If what you say is true it means your little guy has been though a lot before he ended up with you. He was probably mistreated by his first owners meaning any human interaction he will see in a negative way.Then was thrown in a tank with other hamsters. If you havent owned hamsters before dwarfs should never be partnered up with hamsters outside of their litter and some pet shops dont really care so they mix litters into the same tank once they are split up they need to stay on their own. So this little guy was probably met with hostility and territorial behavior from other hams he would have needed to defend himself and probably got into a lot of gory fights.This is going to take a large toll on a hamsters well being he will have no trust for anyone and maybe have some territorialcage problems.With a hamster like this its going to take a lot longer than a normal hamster to earn his trust enough to be able to do anything with him. Make sure his cage has lots of places he can hide such as tubes and hideouts.Go back to basics with him start by talking to him by the cage get him used to your voice. Give him chance to explore his cage without any threats. Keep at this stage until he is comfortable enough to walk around his cage while you talk to him no flinching when you talk. Be patient this could take a while take your time and talk gently and slowly to him you need to bond with him on his terms.Now hes used to your voice try and offer him a treat in the cage. Try a ton of different treats including fruit veg and nuts and find out his preferences. Theres bound to be something he cant resist. For my hamster he loves sunflower seeds but sometimes turns them down however show him an orange flavored yogurt drop and hes guaranteed to take it off of you every single time. This is what will get him to start trusting your hand. Keep offering and letting him take them until he starts to investigate your hand as soon as you place your hand in the cage. You may want to wear gloves at first if he bites just show him the treat if he retreats away from your hand place the treat on the floor and try again tomorrow. Again keep doing this step until the ham is completely comfortable with your hand being by him and in the cage.Now its getting him to trust you on your hand by this stage he should trust your fingers voice and smell. So start putting his favorite treats into your palm so he will partially climb up onto your hand to get to them. He needs to learn he can climb up onto them and get back down without being hurt.This should help you guys develop a bond. Just be patient and slowly gain his trust on his terms.,hamsters,cl2a0cn,5,t5_2sjcj

2475642,0,t3_2nvmk0,Ummm all Gods creatures get thirsty in less than a day.  Dont let your little guy get dehydrated. Make sure the bottle is low enough for easy reach. Tap the bottle nozzle to draw water out onto your finger hold your finger out to show the water.  Do NOT make fast movements. Put a shallow bowl of water out there for him her?.  Change it no less than two times daily it will get messy.  Over the next few days increase the length of time the bowl is out of the cage between changes.  You can leave it out when you see the bottle being used.Dont forget to change the water in the bottle frequently.Pour a glass of water for yourself but dont drink it until the next day.

6739306,0,t1_d0gdtkb,Cats and birds are both social species often living in groups and enjoying one anothers companionship. Its not too much of a stretch for this behavior to cross species and it can often be very beneficial for one or both animals think of stories you see in the news of zoo cheetahs living with dogs to help them learn how to socialize.In the wild syrian hamsters will never live together. They are both solitary and territorial. Even males and females will only tolerate one another long enough to mate. Siblings go their separate ways around  to  weeks and may fight even before then. When theyre little fights arent usually too harmful but it can escalate quickly. Imagine the difference between two seven year old boys fighting each other and two yearold men. ,hamsters,d0gehq2,1,t5_2sjcj
6852078,0,t3_48p09s,Robo hamsters are like that. They are the hardest to tame but I have seen it done. It takes a really long time. Since he doesnt bite you can lay your hand flat in the cage and dont move. If he notices it he might run away at first but hell start to sniff it. Repeat this for about  minutes for  days. After those days are up you can start putting food or treats in your hand and see if he will climb on to your hand and take food from it. Do this for the same amount of minutes and days. After those days are up you can try and scoop him but if he runs away try the next day. Eventually he will get used to your smell. Dont go in to fast as well. Good luck taming! ,hamsters,d0szp05,1,t5_2sjcj

There are also many people who prefer rehoming their own animals so they post on places like hoobly bookoo craigslist etcI recognized your name so looked through your history a bit to confirm my hunch  I would honestly just focus on getting your rabbit and chinchilla some same species friends before delving into something like breeding hams. Both rabbits and chinchillas are very social species and do much better with friends especially rabbits! In my opinion you should provide the best for your current pets before bringing more into the world or taking on more. And considering you have never had more then  hamster at once I fear you might get overwhelmed very quickly. Also if people want hams badly they can drive or wait for one to pop up. I have traveled  hours to adopt mice and almost traveled across country  hours to adopt a rabbit they didnt accept out of country adoptions sadly. If it is important enough the trip will be worth it to a lot of people. I foster with a rescue and I have a lot of people travel out of state to adopt our animals hamsters included.Edit There is also no guarantee how Gooby will react and if it were me I dont know that I would take the risk. The scent of another hamster could cause a negative response in him. You may want to consider just letting him live his peaceful life without the unnecessary stress that breeding may cause for him.,hamsters,d1eykl7,4,t5_2sjcj
7046695,0,t3_4c4szb,My little guy does it too even after upgrading him from a small cage to a huge space  Dont worry too much! Mine also makes a mad dash for the little cage door when I open it after I spend all this time trying to make his home comfy and full of toys... I guess the only thing you might want to consider is the size of his cagepen a pen sounds nice and big though! But here are some helpful size guidelines. Mine was way more antsy about getting out in his smaller cage but he definitely still jumps around the edges when hes not running top speed on his wheel with the bigger cage  just less so.,hamsters,d1f3n0a,1,t5_2sjcj

7613992,0,t3_4jlw71,Did some googling on your behalf. Syrians CAN live up to  years with luck but  is still the general expectancy. It could be that your hamster is just getting old and may be on her way. The symptoms you describe are not uncommon for old age passing.However if you are unable to get her to a vet WHICH YOU SHOULD TRY GET A FRIEND TO TAKE YOU or at least get a phone consultation keep her warm with a heating pad on its lowest setting making sure it isnt going to overheatburn her. Also if you dont see her drinking water use an eyedropper to give her some water and that may help her feel better. Still these are temporary things and the best way to treat her is to get her to a vet.I feel for you since the closest small animal vet is  miles from me and that is a long and terrifying drive for a sick hamster. Best of luck.Hope your girl is okay!,hamsters,d37o69z,2,t5_2sjcj
7699157,0,t1_d3gpcvk,Dont get a pet then. Seriously you have to be the most irresponsible person to consider getting any pet at all at that point. Hamsters need pellets in their diets unless youre  wellinformed on the dietary needs of hamsters and the nutritional value of each and every item you put into their food as well as being able to create an accurate guaranteed analysis. Hamsters are delicate animals with delicate digestive systems and need appropriate food. I honestly wouldnt recommend you get a hamster ever if you value their life so little to the point where you wouldnt even if possible handle their medical bills. I dont think I can view anybody positively who says in the same breath that they love their pet but wouldnt give it medical care it needed. ,hamsters,d3hcdw7,9,t5_2sjcj

9590329,0,t3_5ca3pb,that is not a suitable cage for anything but micerussians need a wheel that is  inch high and just as much bedding cause they are diggers ... factor this in and you see that you need a MUCH MUCH bigger cage.my russian lives like this,hamsters,d9v7cza,2,t5_2sjcj

9626199,0,t3_5cuhw1,There is no such thing as a too big hamster cage its the complete opposite most hamsters who live in small cages display abnormal behaviour and can become stressed that is probably why they want to get out of their cage. The recommended minimum size for one hamster is  sq inches and at least  for two. Hamsters need a lot of room to run around and dig in the wild they they can run several miles every night. Dwarf hamsters are diggers and you need several inches of bedding for them to dig in maybe hide some treats for them in there. Its also recommended that you keep  of everything wheels food bowls houses etc. ,hamsters,d9zmlbr,4,t5_2sjcj

10157016,0,t3_5lf7o2,Hiya its brilliant that you are taking an active stance with your animals weight! If you dont have access to kitchen scales you can do a visual and physical assessment of his body condition.You want to be able to feel your hamsters shoulder bones and hip bones but not so that they protrude. His cheek pouches stretch all the way down his sides so make sure he doesnt have anything in them or you could be feeling the food in his pouches. He shouldnt have too much excess fat on his tummy I generally look for a triangular shape going from the chest up into the pelvis area.The image Ive attached is for guinea pigs and rabbits but gives you the general idea for hamsters too and shows how to do a body conditioning test.If you are ever in doubt about his weight a visit to the vets is a good idea as they can weigh him for you and give you nutritional advice.Pm me if you have any questions   ,hamsters,dbvcrdy,7,t5_2sjcj
10282326,0,t3_5n6y5t,I would say this is too small the RSPCA used to give a minimum size suggestion of cmxcm which many including myself believe is too small still. The cage you linked is smaller than this. My cage has double this a standard wire cage with a bin cage attached. I dont even bother looking at hamster cages and go straight for cages for larger animals like rats rabbits of chinchilla.What is your budget for a cage?,hamsters,dc9k3mr,2,t5_2sjcj

We are currently studying the effects of hydrocephalus in Syrians and malocclusion including tooth loss is a common symptom. I have one myself that has very brittle teeth and requires a special diet.  I would love to chat more about him when you feel up to it.

I woke up this morning and he was running on the wheel again! So I think Im personally happier with the traditional wheel in cages.
