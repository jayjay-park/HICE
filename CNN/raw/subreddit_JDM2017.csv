11027203,0,t3_5wev6v,If Im honest I really couldnt choose between three subjects including JDM so I decided to enrol give them all a go make judgements accordingly and then drop the courses Ive decided arent for me.Upon first impressions JDM is one of the coolest courses Ive seen! The first contact session felt like an interactive Ted Talk in the best way possible. I absolutely love the podcasts and am thoroughly enjoying the book so far. My only qualm is that the assessment is quite different from what Im used to and that worries me regarding grades. Im just hoping that grading isnt super subjective and that applying oneself will end in good results So overall my judgement of this course is very positive and Ive decided Ill probably stick with it provided I dont die in the first quiz haha.,JDM2017,dehwpuq,4,t5_3iqr3
11027240,0,t1_deb6pr4,I totally agree the lack of an ice breaker was refreshing! Though like others have mentioned Im worried about the constant switching of tables... seems hard to get settled when youre constantly moving around. Yes I honestly wish all my other courses were podcastbased theyre amazing ,JDM2017,dehwva1,1,t5_3iqr3

11223769,0,t3_5z8lk8,I often wonder to myself why I do things a lot of the time and I struggle to come up with answers. Everyday life runs on unconscious processes  and that is very clear to me now. I wake up and follow the same routine everyday  brushing teeth showering eating breakfast yet I dont have to tell myself go have breakfast I simply am walking to the kitchen before even realising. Another great example is driving from one location to another sometimes you end up at the destination and you dont even recall driving there! Then there is the complete opposite say taking these quizzes every week you get handed the quiz and read the questions and then genuinely go through a process of thinking about the best possible answer you could give. In terms of most judgements and decisions occurring unconsciously it would bother me if I hadnt read the chapter from the Mindeware. However after being informed that the unconscious mind considers what cant be verbalised as well as what can and this ultimately leads us to make better choices which I thought was pretty cool!,JDM2017,df47833,5,t5_3iqr3
11239830,0,t1_df5z6xh,I like your take on this topic.I feel some of the questions we are asked to deliberate are to centered around having an existential crisis than completely necessary.Mentioning the idea of self identity really resonated with me as I feel the people who would be put off by the idea of not being in control are those who are to begin with unsatisfied with who they are or where their life is going  to take away the hope that at least they can change that actively is a notion oozing with horror.Then additionally you turned around on this with your metaphor of an iceberg showing a symbiotic relationship between both areas of the mind collaborating rather than competing. I found that quite cleaver and insightful.,JDM2017,df60ocy,2,t5_3iqr3

11427856,0,t1_dfrbsl3,Yes if you can do all  of those that would be the best option because then you can be less worried about any characteristics of the bed itself. I think it would be better if you can randomly allocate yourself to one of the  for each day because Im not sure that carry over effects would be an issue here but based on your original post you were wanting to avoid the disruption of having to decide where youll be sleeping each day?,JDM2017,dfrc3ca,1,t5_3iqr3
11443445,0,t1_dfr8dli,I completely agree I think people get comfortable and then they just dont want to leave for the fear of leaving will lead to unknown and possibly adverse consequences. I think fear is a primary drive for people to avoid what could potential be better circumstances for them. ,JDM2017,dft3rbq,1,t5_3iqr3

11551022,0,t1_dg58bhs,I feel like this is a super common thing  where you desperately want something to work so you try everything that MIGHT work all at once. Ive done this so many times too and its such a cycle because wanting to find an effect can really overpower any kind of systematic approach you previously had. That being said like youve mentioned you figure out pretty quickly that you have to be more rigorous and controlled in your data collection in order to actually DISCOVER the effect. Super interesting point!,JDM2017,dg5b84y,3,t5_3iqr3
11714030,0,t3_64i8ki,I think it is quite important for the population to remain skeptical about random findings from researchers. Likewise to many others  I think that the media proposes a great starting point for data and finding to be shared however  this doesnt mean there is any reliability or validity in the findings that do get shared. For example warning can be released saying not to use a product because it potentially gives cancer  yet this is announced because ONE study has found a correlation between the two variables. It is completely misleading and quite scary to think about! The Open Science Framework sounds like a cool idea and likewise to the discussion on the podcast it allows experimenters to tell a story which maps onto the data  results can be intriguing and surprising.Studies will always be biassed however and the general population will remain uneducated on correlation and causation  which I also believe is an issue that should be resolved.We have seen Multiple Regression Analysis to become more common however I think carefully controlled experiments should remain trumping MRA. ,JDM2017,dgntc0y,11,t5_3iqr3
11716104,0,t1_dg5dgb6,I often find myself wondering if everyone else goes through these exact same revelations. Once I begin discussing them with family or friends I find that they definitely seem to. Its like the old saying you never know until you try it. However I feel it can take quite some time and effort to change our everyday lives. We are creatures of habit and experiencing new things isnt on the daily to do. I personally think that is what is so great about travelling. You get thrown into things you never knew existed purely just to immerse yourself. ,JDM2017,dgo1sjf,1,t5_3iqr3
