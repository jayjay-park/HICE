6244313,0,t3_413cpi,I play that way. I start them with ripped pants and a plain shirt then make a mall where they have to buy better outfits. What would be better too is if they added shabbier furniture. Like the old stained couches from sims  university. And crate box night stands and cinder block bookshelf. They wouldnt have to add those exact items I was just using them as an example. I feel like everything is too nice to start off with and there isnt much need to buy better things. ,Sims4,cyzesf6,3,t5_2x5o7

8231244,0,t3_4ryo5t,In an earlier version of sims it was different for different sims. Like some would prefer reading books and some would prefer TV or video games. I dont know if thats still the case in sims  or if the fun points just depend on the object being used. But I find computer games to be pretty fast and universally wellliked.,Sims4,d56gmya,2,t5_2x5o7

11553475,0,t1_dg5gvq2,Nice job! And way to go getting that reaper shot. Love the fire incident  reminded me of accidentally killing off households in TS with the firework...machine...thing haha. I really like the graveyard area. D That CC pyramid ceiling you have is really nifty and seems to suit a graveyard.Also to report in I have the main stuff of my cemetery done and landscaped after about  hours work so far. It puts the one Ive been coming back to now and then for  years to utter shame. Just need to furnish my churchcastle and play in live mode to adjust the lighting and fog. Also to get screen shots of course. Then Ill be able to post my album as well.  ,Sims4,dg5l91s,2,t5_2x5o7
