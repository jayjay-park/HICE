We came under new  management a short time ago and with good reason as you have experienced yourself. But in any case i just wanted to apologize on behalf of the company,Sudbury,cex5554,1,t5_2sgfu

1395283,0,t3_2a37e5,Curbside collection would either go drastically up in cost or the schedules would not longer be in sync with Blue Box collection.Scenario  No change to collection DAY just alternating weeksBecause of the increased volume at each address due to saving garbage for two weeks either more trucks would have to be put on the road or crews would be working EXTREMELY long days. But on the weeks where there is no garbage collection workers and excess trucks would sit idle. Terrible waste of money as youd never be able to convince an employee to shift their hours around in a twoweek cycle like that and the cost of putting a couple more trucks on the road is considerably high.Scenario  Curbside collection is no longer in sync with Blue Box and OrganicsThere would be an insanely high number of growing pains and headaches associated with this schedule which would likely lead to even greater amounts of missed calls and complaints to the City. As an aside I really dont think altering the frequency of garbage pick ups will influence how much stuff gets recycled or composted. Most people like dave already have stretched and sorted to their limit. A lot of things just simply arent recyclablecompostable. ,Sudbury,cir6h8k,1,t5_2sgfu

2038173,0,t1_ckvbo47,Sudbury Transit would be much more useful if they started the buses an hour earlier and offered something like  minute round trip transfers. Any extra costs for the start time wouldnt even be noticed because more people would use public transit. And the transfer thing again more people would actually use Sudbury Transit. In two years Ive actually used the bus maybe two dozen times. I pretty much just walk everywhere like to Food Basics or to Hart since my place is downtown.,Sudbury,ckywb4r,1,t5_2sgfu
2553546,0,t1_cmrsyu7,This isnt just anecdote its borne out by the data. Look at the Sudbury Community Foundation reports or StatCan data. You may be one example as am I but the overall data trend is in the opposite direction. Economically Sudbury has been stagnant for a very long time.Its not just an attitudinal problem its a real demographic trend thats going see us as the oldest fattest and sickest community in Canada very soon. And the prevailing wisdom  that mining and large public infrastructure projects are going to turn it around  arent going to save it.Why does LU have such shitty faculty retention despite one of the sweetest collective agreements in the country and a shortage of faculty jobs everywhere? Why does the city employ a person and have a budget just to settle doctors? Because its a rough town to move to.Its all fine and good to say its just an attitude problem but when youre verging on a quarter of your population being retired and City services spread thin by shitty development decisions its a pretty serious problem.,Sudbury,cmrvvxo,3,t5_2sgfu

6197923,0,t3_4030gw,Graduated from the course in  and I find it weird that its essentially a prereq to find an apprenticeship these days but trades are still regarded as a lower form of education than college or university diplomas.That said whether its worth while or not depends on what you want to be doing in the end. If youre looking to be doing maintenance work in heavy industrial sies its okay. If you want to wire houses and commercial buildings then youre probsbly better off seeking out an actual apprenticeship or trying to get on with the local IBEW. Note there is usually a lot of stiff competition for the IBEW apprentice intakes.,Sudbury,cyu4yu9,1,t5_2sgfu

11301266,0,t1_dfb0esj,I meant to reply about the disdain for the downtown. The common complaints are that there is no parking despite there being almost  parking spots and that its sketchy. That usually fleshes out into some complaints about panhandlers andor drug addicts andor crime.Now im  and a dude so I admit that my experiences are likely informed by that but I find the panhandlers to be quiet and fine and apart from a handful of superhighpeople sightings in almost  years hanging around downtown I dont see the drugaddict thing being an issue. And same for crime.To be honest Ive never been able to shake the feeling that once people find out there isnt a costco parking lot for them they suddenly have an aversion to downtown that isnt based on any reality. Ive seen the following comments on local news stories about downtown paraphrased dozens of timesI NEVER go downtown. Theres no parking and its sketchy. SO I NEVER SPEND TIME THERESo these people who spend no time there and never go there are certain its awful? Alrighty!In sum I think most complainers are mad that its not a shopping mall.,Sudbury,dfczcse,2,t5_2sgfu
