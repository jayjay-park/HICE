4524846,0,t3_3d1psr,. If youre going for a one shot you dont use empowered e. If youre one shotting someone theres no need to snare them because the idea of one shotting is to kill them before they can do anything. The combo for one shotting is Q gt Hydra W E Midair gt Q.Note that you can cast your empowered Q before you jump. All Q does is modify Rengars next autoattack so you can activate it whenever you want as long as you jumpuse the autoattack within  seconds.. It doesnt really matter but optimally youd do it before using hydra because exhaust lowers their armormr by a little so youd do a bit more damage.. Use ignite as soon as possible to minimize the enemys healing.. Rengars three core items are Tiamat Youmuus and Last Whisper. Always. Those should always be your first three items with boots thrown in there somewhere.,Rengarmains,ct0zulq,1,t5_33y9g

Rengar played as an assassin has no use for armor reduction youre not assassinating tanks and relatively little use for health you should be in and out.

4625284,0,t3_3e6y6q,So I reviewed Zephyr vs TriForce vs PD stats and after crunching its a cluster fuck. I may need put some diagrams and charts because there are many factors. So Ill just give the TLDRIn terms of gold efficiency Since on PD you have wasted stats  crit chance and . attack speed when you use both empowered Q and active Ghostblade  . gold. The actual price becomes g. Zephyr has no wasted stats at a cost of g. Triforce has wasted stats on the mana from sheen. It is still  gold efificient but is  gold more expensive than the other two items. Ergo Zephyr is the most gold efficient followed by PD then Trinity ForceIn terms of burst Trinity Force is ONLY superior when used with the spellblade passive but massively overefficient. Otherwise it is not. If we remove the spellblade passive double PD is the most efficient AND reliable build as well as slightly more expensive than the Zephyr build which is compensated by the reliability of it. To put this reliability into context your damage numers will be Savagery  . Empowered savagery   Auto attack  without resistances. These numbers are all crits with IE multiplier.In terms of crit chance  Zephyr    you do  damage with auto attacks and auto attack modifiers TriForce    you do  damage xPD    you do  damage Actually whats interesting here is that triforces two passives especially the sheen bonus damage put it on par with the xPD build. But PD is cheaper ergo you spike earlier.Tell me if you want me to put the calculations up on google docs. Im done for today I might take it up tomorrow and draw some graphs to make it more visible. I also really want to look into the TriforceZephyr without PD build by bandannadann since its the best burst combo but the most expensive which means late spike. Which means it might only be justified when extremely ahead.EDIT I may also review and compare double IE build to triforce build since i feel double IE will be the superior burst build both items cost roughly the same with the drawbacks being the mov.speedatk. speed loss but a significant  crit chance and  more ad.,Rengarmains,ctdl97u,2,t5_33y9g

5226842,0,t3_3mjkqu,Take a break. Do not play lol for a couple of hours or go play with another champ you like or try some aramsI am a g summoner with over  arams played due to the stress relief it offers me or if not call it a day and try the next day.It mental here. Yesterday I lost a game and blamed the team most of the fault was theirs anyway and got angry so I decided to play a rank thinking I get a better team that can resist to the epicness of my champion. But I sucked because I started the game angry and even thogh I had a  start I lost the game. So I stopped for the day. Today I started with a fresh mind and opthimistic mentality and even though I played rengar support and a game top lane vs fiora I cartied them both with no problem and eventually got my mastery  at last!Thats a simple lol rule in general if you start to suck bad even with your best champs take a break smoke a cigarette waych a movie drink a coffee or take a nap and come back with full positive energy!,Rengarmains,cvg0xoy,1,t5_33y9g
5253816,0,t1_cvj53ne,Unlike noc rengar is a rather skill rewarding champion which is medium difficulty to learn but hard to master but when you get to know to play him well your opponents will cry especially their adc and apc.But its simply your choice and depends a lot on what style you like rengar and noc being very different. For example I have all but  champions and noc is one of them I always thought that he is ok but I would get bored very fast. Rengar though when I first saw him I couldnt believe my eyes and the moment he appeared in store I refunded  champions bought on rp to buy him for  rp as it was love at first sight.Rengar has lots of benefits for jungle no mana big damage output spell that gains him armor and mr self heal and after lvl  incredible ganks!,Rengarmains,cvj9uc0,1,t5_33y9g

5386833,0,t3_3ortx3,Most of his lane matchups are skill dependent but you should have an easy time laning against the likes of ChoGath Lissandra Gnar and Lulu. The guide in the sidebar has every matchup you could think of except Kindred I suppose.I just practiced in the actual games and failed a lot before I mastered it and thats basically how it works. You can do it in a custom but that sheltered environment doesnt have any of the pressure or mayhem of an intense teamfight so at the end of the day its up to you to go big when it matters most. Make the combos muscle memory and then youll be golden.Im a top lane main so I cant give many effective jungle tips but I can tell you that the best time to invade is when your laners are pushing their lanes to the tower. That means the lane opponents are stuck under tower farming and likely wont be able to help their jungler. Thats fine. Thats a pretty optimal build. I build just about the same items every game too. Its a good thing. There arent any better damage items than those with the exception of Trinity Force over PD but Trinity is currently bugged.

6020245,0,t1_cy8o9va,gtHey a couple of questions. gt. Which smite do you go? If its game dependent what influences your decision?Currently transitioning to Trackers Knife. The  wards are very valuable for your team. Helps secure your midlane from ganks or lanes you have recently ganked so to speak. Or invade wardsgt. When you say Finish or buy either Tiamat or youmuus what are you talking about? Finish what?Currently doing the math om this subject aswell so we know which will deal more damage and is more cost effective. First the runes though.Finish youmuus since you bought caulfields or buy tiamat sitting on it for later.gt. In the next line you say Finish or buy the item you didnt get from above Do you mean finish Tiamat into Hydra? As in if you finished youmuus buy tiamat. If you bought tiamat finish youmuus.They are the second core you will look to get.gt. When would I choose to get Tiamat over ghostblade first or the other way around?Damage invades and stuff. The pickaxe powerspike is stronger than double longswords takes up less space aswell.  However the double longsword is cheaper and costs  each.But as I said currently doing the math on this subject to find out which is stronger in terms of damage. Give me a few days and Ill have it all figured out hopefully PgtSorry if these are stupid questions I just wanna make sure Im understanding it. Thanks so much! Always happy to help gtP.S.

6097052,0,t1_cyijos2,Let me warn you of my english it is not the best So the first thing is that it is both normal games. If you want to test your skill and improve I say hop into ranked  even tho it is hard getting rengar these days  also you really are do are die with rengar you jump like most of the times and end up dying or maybe getting a kill sometimes it is worth and sometimes not. your early game could use some work to be honest you farm and that is not a problem but sometimes you went to krugs while top gank was kind of free Rengar is really good at lane ganking use that! also there are a lot of builds personally not a fan of your build but if you like it go for it but I do highly suggest  things .going blue trinket instead of upgraded sweep. . Upgrade your boots to green ones pretty early if you can it works really well on rengar. next up is your runes and masteries. Masteries are fine just go thunderlord this patch I pref dangerous game in the jungle and bandit top though.The runes are used by a lot of other rengars but you could different styles with your runes imo you dont really know what you want you got scaling health scaling cdr flat armor just be straightforward do you want strong early game or strong late.My top runesMy jungle runesOther then that I cant really judge since it was mixed elo you got some kills where the enemy did something stupid but keep catching people. Deep ward with blue trinket. If this wasnt really the anwser  I dont know either since it is basicly the standard stuff. ,Rengarmains,cyio7op,2,t5_33y9g

I just think that its better if people know about it because it could happen to them in an actual game like it happened to me. I think its easy to avoid as long as youre aware of its existence. You can avoid the bug by casting E early in your leap or using Q as an auto reset after leap rather than using it as part of your leap.I think it should be removed because not only is it inefficient it also bypasses the . second silence after getting  ferocity which is probably unintended.,Rengarmains,czgyalt,1,t5_33y9g

I dont think so you lack waveclear reliable burst and sustain if you dont have Red Elixir and its much more DPS oriented while also being squishy as hell seriously his AD before IE was pretty low for the snowball he had going. The sole reason it worked during that match was because the enemy team was made up of very squishy champions  who he could easily blow up in a couple seconds  and even then he took a significant while.Now dont get me wrong I like watching NB and he is a quite good jung overall but for Rengar builds you watch someone else.,Rengarmains,d1c7y7t,3,t5_33y9g

7063904,0,t3_4cctqi,You build an offtank rengar to deal with the fact that you get dumpstered in lane by everyone if you dont get ahead. By getting some early  mid game tank items it allows you to deal with people you would otherwise be unable to face. It also allows you to take grasp of the undying which gives you good sustain and trading power. I feel like a bruiser rengar would be better for a new rengar player as it is less punishing of the mistakes you will make. Your build would look something like Dorans blade  Shield gt Tiamat gt Sunfire gt Ravenous Hydra gtSpirit Visage gt Optional. If you are behind early dont be afraid to pick up a bamis cinder or specters cowl before your tiamat. Optional items can range from things link black cleaver  better against tanks than ldr  blood thirster phantom dancer deaths dance etc. I like getting a decent amount of lifesteal because it allows you to stay alive for a considerable amount of time combod with your empowered Q and W.So with an off tank build you can mitigate some of rengars lane weaknesses but you pay for that with less hard carry potential.This is something that I would only build out of top never in jungle. When jungling you have the luxury of not facing a laner so you dont need to spec defensive stats to deal with them. You also dont get punished for your weak laning while in the jungle so it can be easier to play for new rengar players.,Rengarmains,d1h1zo2,1,t5_33y9g

He told me that you are better off casting tiamat as soon as possible because no matter when you cast it during your leap the target will always take the  damage. Later I tried the combo for a couple hours in a custom and found out that using TiamatW gt E makes it hard to hit the bola whereas doing E asap when leap animation starts gt TiamatW would almost always guarantee a successful bola.  This might actually be due to the s cast time because casting E as soon as possible makes it going off at point blank range or almost from your target ,Rengarmains,d1hr7br,1,t5_33y9g

Which is also why I dislike the Devourer jungle no good early CDR without gimping your damage or impact in the game.Go warrior into tiamat and ionian.  Finish Steraks Gage Titanic Hydra and then some resistance items. Remember to only get Titanic after your first HP item otherwise its not gold efficient enough.

8127898,0,t3_4qjdpi,The main thing you can do is hunt for picks punish anyone who miss positions this is an easy way to allow for v fights or allow your team uncontested objectives. The next best thing ive found is ensuring your team is safe from any squishy damage dealers wait for a fight to start and plan it out dont force yourself in if you cant kill anyone snare somone and try to get to safety. Its really about patience. If your speaking about carrying in the sense that youre already fed then make your presence very unclear use vision to you advantage to try to give them false senses of security as rengar you get to A run real fast with ulti yommus and B get from a to b unseen. Essentially just do your best to trick the other team into engaging in places where u thrive the jg when you behind them etc. Since youre fed if u can acomplish that youre free to wipe them essentially or at the minimum get your team a safer fight to take. You simply cant do it on your own so its really about utilizing yourself in a way which maximizes even a feeding teams ability.,Rengarmains,d4tnds7,2,t5_33y9g
8148089,0,t3_4qr29k,The issue with movement speed is that its either too good or too bad. Lemme explain. Lets say rengar is running at you at a LUDICROUS amount of speed. There is nothing you can do then and people will still complain.

8575240,0,t3_4x8zsm,So according to some math done by a rather intelligent fella who wasnt me rengar benefits more from arpen than flat ad by level ! The drawback here is that arpen is much less effective than AD for clearing the jungle. But AS is more effective than either of them for clearing hence the x AS page you talked of being very popular right now. I personally run neither of them at the moment. But Im too much a whore for CDR for my own good XD. Personally though of the two you mentioned the arpen AS one is better in more situations than not. Its certainly not a bad idea to have a couple pages set up because if youre against a lee or a nidalee who is going to invade you that page wont help too much alternatively against some one you want to invade that page wont do you a ton of justice either!,Rengarmains,d6dhkmc,3,t5_33y9g

Bad trade you did find the worst timing to go in right at the star.At least the best thing that you could had done there was to jump on himbefore the minion wave was therebut if he was a good lucian he would outrade that we.  right here you did fucked up.On that scenario it was pretty much who gets lvl first rapes the other one.You had hp adv extra spellempQ also exhaust.That was a free kill or a free zoning but not only you did decide to go for a minion but you also did cancel your Q.Just because of that you lost at lvlampnbspNow look at yourself sticking at towergood W though to get csdid you see the lucian did drag all the minions near the river to take off the bushesfrom you?. bad timing and bad trade.You did faild to cancel aagtQ animation and you got outrade.Look at all those minions around you.Even if you were in a better situation YOU ARE LOOSING FARM.FUCK KILLS FARM IS BETTER EARLY GAMEcskill never forget thatGood jgank and good shove gj you made me proudAbout purchase item.Well IMO DirkgtGB rush would have been a better buy then tiamat.ampnbspSince you still need to learn about minion wave managmentgetting a tiamat is like doing a favor to him.You would push into himgtthen he could freeze the lane and not only that would HELPED HIM A LOT but also giving you free rooms to get easy ganked by Zac.. why are you trying to force a trade?Not only you did not had stacksyou also did waste them on the cannon minionbut then you faild to make a proper combo.Also a bit of minion dmg.The proper way you could played there wasGet  ferc.Get lvl in the bushwithout him knowing it since that harambe wouldnot thought that you have exp advantage and then USE the  ult jump technice to kill him.After that here comes THAT ult.....TwT    oh and btw almost always use empW vs Haroldthat sexai got saved at the last moments lolThe early cdr boots rush its questionable.Reason number When you purchase the boots you had your ult on CD so the ult didnt get nothing worth from itSince you are ahead you can rape that lucian with even more extra advantage REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU UPampnbspOK now look.You had vision when you took Harlod and back thenZac was bot.What does that mean?The he did probably clear all the botlane side jungleso where he might go next?Loose goldampexp just to gank bot again or simply go topside now get that expampgold and then gank topmid?Again around . you could jump ult to kill himLook now what you did do after that.You did try and play CASSINO to guess where that Lucian would move to land an empE.NEVER DO THAT unless you are feed afRemember what I told you about Zac?UPS here he is Q.QTalking about decision making you had  option before that happend.Hard shove since you also had Tiamat and then recall to buy itemgtgank bot to shutdown botlane and get towergtdragon OR at least get  of those things or Get feed af from that Lucian and get all the attention of Zac in toplaneand even kill both of themor  when vs but you dont die. bad empQ you should had used E followed up with AAorbwalkgtQ to kill the lucian you wasted exhaust there. dont use empW use empQ to gain atsp to shred the tower faster. You saw lucian heading near the bush it was obvs that he was going to ward that and even so a little later you saw him Lucian postion after you did move on the bushamphe did hit you.after that you did everything really bad.If Harambe was watching you he would go be crying.Not onlybad allin jump but you also did that WTF recall right there.Then you walked really badwhy on the right side?ampnbspHow you could had played that better.The best obvs was to just back off totaly and not recall there but if you were forced you could simply ulted fasteryou could had done that because you had vision of lucian coming at you ALSO FLASH LUCIAN Qyes you can dodge it using flash and then follow it up with a ult play.Dont forget that you also took  extra towershot cause you didnt use empQ back then before. WOW WOW you did tilt me a litte.ONCE AGAIN you could had double jump with ULT on Lucian but you didnt do that even soLUCIAN DID WASTE E FOR NOTHING...after that at . why you did use empQ and not E???!!. what are you doing standing there?. why you ulted?to scare the black nigga?Around minute  imagine now if you had your ult that free kill. why you ult?Did you think that you could vs them?,Rengarmains,d7bcnm2,1,t5_33y9g

I love the attack speed for early clears as well as the damage the attack speed provides with the titanic hydra on top of the trifoce.It was in there buddy but to be honest it depends if you prefer the early CDR but i noramlly always end up with  CDR regardless and with ghost as well as the mov speed i get with tri amp deadmans i dont normaly need my ultimate up a whole lot but by triforce time you will have  cdr anyway. i could lie and say my preference is better but thats for my playstyle it depends if you dont mind burning ghost to make sure you get to where you want to be but  of the time you wont need ulti or ghost to gank even more so if you are tanky enough to dive for  shots or so. Its personal preference. I might try attack speed and Armour pen rather than AD and attack speed to see how much more damage that does to ADC targets it may help a lot more with insta bursting squishes while being so tanky.,Rengarmains,d7w1arj,1,t5_33y9g

Crit rengar is good if youre fed but you know the feeling of being like  and teamfights start? yea youre useless if you cant oneshot the adc. This build is easly able to oneshot or kill the adc in like .   second and youre tanky af with k hp and  mr and armor... Ok and now... dont do this shit  sure if you want to have fun do what you want but if you want to get dia pick  champs for the  rolls you play and spam the shit out of them. And for Rengar Laneganks and be versatile dont go for the fast lvl  every game most games i play on my smurf i get fed early because top laners are just dumb af. Ganking top at around min  with lvl  is a free kill most of the time and getting tiamat early with jungle item allows you to counterjungle. AND i know  this sucks sometimes but just play more and youll get dia without a problem. YOU are the deciding factor in every game.   .

9596338,0,t3_5cezem,The reason Rengar Ult has changed is precisely because it was great for scouting great for escaping great for engaging and great for fighting. I dont think well ever have something like that back.Your st suggestion would exarcebate the problem that most people have with Rengo suddenly jumping and unloading tons of damage on them. More than that it would lead to Ferocity stacking which is against the design goals of Riot. So I dont think it can get implemented. Your th suggestion on the other hand makes a lot of sense and is something Ive been thinking as well. Our scouting with the Ult gives a lot of information to the enemy team which in a  sense hinder the point of scouting. While I can see the uses of Rengos new ult I would suggest simply making the alert and vision radius  at all levels. It would reinforce its role as an engage and flanking tool and pretty much end its scouting functions but I think it would be best for his kit.   And to be fair that was also the biggest issue with old Rengar a Rengo with Ult on cooldown lost his escape his engage sans bushes and part of his fighting prowess. New Ult follows a similar pattern though much weaker its scouting is problematic its only useful for escaping if you manage a lead on your harassers and it gives you a free crit in a fight. Its still great for engaging though.,Rengarmains,d9vy0pi,1,t5_33y9g

10428182,0,t1_dc8lpfe,Just want to say a couple of things gt Ability usage requires more thought aka when do you use emp Q and when emp WWell i dont think this is really true imo.Emp W is overused because you have sooo much damage that sometimes you dont even need Emp Q so CC inmunity is much better.Emp E has little use because Q has dash and you have tons of movement speed due to your passive so whats the point of using Emp E when most of the time you can use Emp Q deal more damage and dash.gt Proper Ultimate usage warrants you be in the right place at the right time. Otherwise they will just see the ultimate and either run or protect the carryI agree new Ultimate requires a better set up than the old one although it doesnt fit the scouting ability Riot wanted to create.gt So playing both Assassin and frontline New Rengar takes a lot less skill than the old that just depended on your build? Well Assassin Rengar can pretty much oneshot with JumpgtQ which is more simplified and more boring than the old Rengar. gtOld Rengar wasnt easy but you cant say that he was harder than current.My conclusion to this is that Rengar skill floor is higher than pre rework since most of the first time Rengar seems to struggle with the champion.However his skill cap is lower than pre rework this is can be seen in the high winrates OTP and mains  can achieve.,Rengarmains,dcq3q3e,1,t5_33y9g

10715206,0,t3_5t80hl,Let me give you my recipe.Start with talisman and bottle and always be pulled from botside.Forget your jungle item and go straight for BC.Then get all lethality items yommus first preferably for the cdr.With full lethality reds and cdr blues and quints u get  cdr with yommu and BC and  lethality with all items.

10793181,0,t1_ddrtg5s,The idea its to make the target tell their team mates and to promote comunication with the team also this will help Rengar vs unorganized foes also the mark should get a lower range to make this more effective I came with this idea after reading his old ult Enemies can feel the presence of Rengar so they get an exclamation so now only  enemy have the mark so only  should feel the presence of Rengar.,Rengarmains,ddt8nra,1,t5_33y9g

No of course not youre gonna be fucking dead if you wanted to be hooked by blitz. Thats why I included mechanics on it because you really need to be good in mechanics in order to be a good rengar. ,Rengarmains,ddt9dif,1,t5_33y9g

11194132,0,t1_df0txpn,Rengar top performs directly to your skill level with him. Winning games in general is easier as a jungler but playing rengar top is interactive. The lane is skill based and matchups are interesting except for nautilus he can go fuck himself. I play rengar top mostly just cause its more fun and I got diamond last season maining jungle and want to prove to myself that I can get there with top too. Rengar jungle gives you easy outs to get stacks playing top makes your ability to play the macro game more important since you need to choose your roams more carefully since youre not just press buttons and get cc for free. Both equally viable imo but it just depends on howwhat you want to do.,Rengarmains,df0ub0l,1,t5_33y9g
