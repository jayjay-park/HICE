7735560,0,t1_d3l89c6,Well that wasnt really the point of my post. Ofc Azir can proc TDL very easily and deal good dmg while hes really safe. But most of the time you wont take trade early cause of the mobility etc. of your opponent. Zed  LB etc. counter Azir but you can still win ofc.My question was focusing the afterlaning phase  when there are  peoples on midlane to teamfight while their team is pretty fed and Im not fed enough to deal tons of damages I have Rylai  Nashor for example but if Im alone to carry it is not sufficient.So my question was  how can I carry my team ? I wanted to roam but Azir isnt a good roamer especially in early cause of his weak damage. I can only farm what is good ofc but not sufficient if their team is fed. So what do Bjergsen do if his team is behind the opponents one ? Roaming and be very present everywhere on the map even if he cant farm properly ? Or keep afk farming in order to buy stuff for the late ? Or anything else ?,azirmains,d3lh7rq,1,t5_34mu9

8302510,0,t1_d5fanie,gt Hes strong even with the nerfsNo hes not. Not at . Not until  since he will be behind the entirety of lv  now. Did you read the scaling adjustments? He is down  dmg per soldier attack at lv . Then     dmg reduction per level until . The per attack nerfs hurt him massively until he is lv  since he scaled well off of attack speed and not AP. That means the damage reduction is multiplicative for every attack. He is actually weakest from  where all of his attacks were reduced by  dmg. Good luck trying to not get bullied when the enemies find out they can just walk through yours soldiers now without taking any dmg. Good luck farming enough to get to the late game. Gutting his early AND mid game so severely also hurts his late game because it delays it for so long. You dont get to lv  in half the games you play now. This patch was a typical riot trying to kill a fly with a nuke I guarantee it will be readjusted in  patches. Nerf something so much that its unplayable since it was overpicked in competitive.

Hes an absolute monarch but certainly not a ruthless one.What this translates to in game?  He commands and he conquers.  He pushes up on his enemies with his soldiers takes down their turrets and temporarily constructs his own.  An enemy approaches?  Dispatch a soldier to their location and order the assault.  Assassination attempt?  Phalanx soldiers shove his wouldbe assailant into a less threatening position.  Team is scared to initiate in combat?  Lead the charge.,azirmains,d72m39b,3,t5_34mu9

You take berserker one only if you are running with precisionapen runes otherwise youll loose in dps wise.Im using  or  sort of builds The Dreck build a bit changed posted by Dreckless some weeks or months ago. Its a really aggressive way to play you are not trying to safely scale into levels. You are rushing Protobelt into Rylai around lvl  you got the item and after that you can basicly got a kill easily with a Q AA shurima shuffle  protobelt   AA. After getting rylai youll have to adapt what you build. Are they squishy heavy tanky? If they are squishy go take nashor if not take void staff. If they arent building a lot of magic resistance choose nashor into rabbadon. Speaking like that you need to know exactly how much your damage output is for using that build but once you know well it you surprise a lot of people.  Im using this one almost every game since the games arent lasting very long for you to scale it is worth but if you feel that your game will be very long and youll not have the upper hand even if you build like that take a traditionnal build.  The Dps build you are rushing nashor rylai voidstaff rabbadon and items depending the situation. You can choose to take some apen runes and take berseker boots instead sorcerers one it is the most efficient way to dps  A bit more burst but less dps you are taking first rylai void staff and situationnal item if you can afford items like rabbadon luden you take them. The  as coupled to W steroid make that you can skip nashor. The cons of that build is the lack of cdr  is fairly sufficient for azir but even this build havent ,azirmains,daa7tod,0,t5_34mu9

10497153,0,t3_5qbk5w,Sounds interesting. I like the idea. But so far its just a nerf so how are you supposed to buff him after these azir healthiness adjustments. Cause he for sure doesnt need to be weaker. Besides that he will have this scaling as per auto attack at LV one. You dont Max w first you dont realy get more then  attack speed until LV  and you can make IT up with runes so his early game wont be so effected. Especially since you can attack minions around before you attack the champion so the scaling as has to be realy Low if it should matter or scale with levels. This would also only effect very special circumstanses since its rare to get of two auto attacks after q in the early game. For the most part you get it of with w on enemy aa q aa. In the late game IT might be effective however the attackspeed and Rylais you built might still make IT possible to proc it. The tower removal would make him a bit more healthy maybe but only for solo q. As i understod it they buffed the tower in . because it doesnt make him significiently unhealthy in proplay.Meddler states Rationale for these changes is that we want to add power but want to avoid the burst mobility and CC cases that have been challenging with Azir in the past. More sustained access to soldiers via W makes sense as a result and is definitely the largest of the buffs. The passives also we think a safer place to put power hence doing so in ways that both make it a bit more useable and decrease the cost of doing so a bit.  Its proplay we have to fix because thats where he is op. Removing the tower wouldnt affekt that. Plus its one of the coolest abilities in the game that is a huge part of skins and fits his lore so i would miss it. It could work. But i dont think it would fix his problems and its sad If his passive is removed.,azirmains,dcxyo6x,1,t5_34mu9
10529010,0,t1_dd1f4ab,Think Bjergsen messed up building Azir. Going into Sorc with Liandries would have made that game so much easier. It took Azir so long to become useful and the flat ap that he was being built with was to try and deal dmg to the squishies at the same time as Naut but many team fights all Bjergsen could get done was deal dmg to Naut. Which was negligible until  items. Liandries would have made Azir much stronger thoughout the game and won multiple skirmishes alone.Also buying that Ludens late only to swap it out for Zhonyas was just a small dumb mistake. ,azirmains,dd1ktdt,1,t5_34mu9

11086113,0,t3_5yaiq1,Talon the blades shadow.     From my point of view talons goals are the opposite of yours. He wants to dominate midearly and impact the entire map thanks to his insane mobility.     Laning phase can go two ways. Either the player roams and you are on waveclear duty mid and then on warding mission or he plays the lane to kill you which is a playstyle i just havent encountered mostly because it should never happen.  When against a roamer ive found that roaming yourself tends to be inefficient on top of dangerous. A talon player will ward your jungle and the risk you take by roaming is extremely high since you never ever win a flat out v and youre most likely to be sitting on a ward. Thats why i tend to prefer nashors tooth to push while hes gone. Generally you want to ward on his first roams before puhsing blindly since many talons like to fake roam just to exert pressure. Ive also found that even though eq can go over walls its better to escape in the open  fight there since he has no way of going through your wall. It seems obvious once said but i dont do it naturally in game so i guess its not.     I also like to play against him as though as i was against a fiddle by warding a bit deeper than usual and mostly flanks. Talon will probably not engage a face front v but look to assassinate the backline and i find he does this better than most other assassins due to stealth. Avoiding objectives like nash and drake can be good since its really where you can get picked off easily but can also be a great call to punish his roams if your topside of the map has champs such as mao khazix to melt nash. Ive often gotten  min barons off those plays mostly when the enemys commit  man bot.  For summoner spells i take barrier over exhaust since you just dont have the time to press exhaust but can always barrier. Zhonya is the only other must have. The rest is pretty much up to you and personal preference or at least i believe it to be so.   ,azirmains,deolnep,3,t5_34mu9
