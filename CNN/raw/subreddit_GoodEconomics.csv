4054421,0,t1_crid4no,This chart shows a comparison of CO emissions per tonnekm. Interesting that the relative emissions for truck and rail have been decreasing and maritime shipping have stayed constant. I wonder is there much that could be done to bring the emissions per transport unit down with the right incentives.,GoodEconomics,crifnqp,2,t5_34b2u

Seems like he is willing to bet it all on his personal ideas right away. Extreme self confidence? Would economists agree that these ideas wouldnt be bad?,GoodEconomics,cv7brvx,1,t5_34b2u
5723265,0,t1_cx6iub2,The idea is that they are so productive that they are well beyond their satiation point. Its not that no one spends time growing food its that they are so good at it that their relationship with food probably resembles our association with drinking water you can drink your fill for a few dollars a year basically nothing.,GoodEconomics,cx6j0b6,1,t5_34b2u

6491522,0,t1_czqncad,I think youre right about the sort of decisions youd make for a firm. I will say if youre looking for good intro economics book I would recommend Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell. It isnt very quantitative and hes got a bit of conservative bias but its great book for understanding the fundamentals of economics. ,GoodEconomics,czqrst5,2,t5_34b2u

7978762,0,t1_d4cczjm,Yes that is an issue with using the big mac index. Also I noticed that the index was slow to adapt to currency shifts so for example if there was a sudden weakening in a currency in  then that country would generally come out higher on these graphs. However using a basket of goods has a bias towards quantity over quality. For example the Indian rupee is undervalued by   the price according to a traditional PPP in  although this is clearly not accurate as India is a net importer of goods which would be virtually impossible if it was  times cheaper to buy Indian goods  compared with American goods of an identical quality. Using my adjustment India is only undervalued by   the price.,GoodEconomics,d4cvz9h,1,t5_34b2u

Ok but you also just quoted WNF saying that economic reforms wont lead to longterm growth without inclusive political institutions which Germany did not have for decades under Bismarck.  So how did they become a major industrial power?,GoodEconomics,ddtej1i,2,t5_34b2u
