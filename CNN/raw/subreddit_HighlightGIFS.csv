338063,0,t1_cffrpka,Its not that anything goes here is a good example of a thing that does not go incident happens at about  replay at .It really is the technical stuff that is the biggest limitation. For example in a tackle you cannot hit them above the shoulders but when they are bent over the ball it is almost impossible not to. But you must enter a ruck through the gate ie from directly in front. This means that the vast majority of hits come from infront of you which reduces the danger somewhat. Entering a ruck from the side is one of the most common infringements in rugby. As for fluidity there are two broad styles to the game. The southern hemisphere teams tend to play a more flowy and expansive game the teams in this gif are from Sydney Aus and Auckland NZ with lots of passing and counterattacking. Northern hemisphere teams tend to kick more and are more restrained in their attacking movements as a result their games are more stopstart and IMO not as exciting.If your interested here are some of the best games from last year.South Africa vs New Zealand These are the  best teams in the world and this match was to determine the winner of the Rugby Championship.Australia vs New Zealand From the same competition as SA vs NZ. Australia had been pretty shit all year and this is the first time they actually played well.Ireland vs New Zealand Sensing a pattern here? New Zealand were aiming to become the first team ever to win every match in a year. Ireland played incredibly well.Highlanders vs Chiefs Not the All Blacks this time but both sides are from New Zealand. The chiefs went on to win the competition last year.   ,HighlightGIFS,cfft6ve,3,t5_2vb76
