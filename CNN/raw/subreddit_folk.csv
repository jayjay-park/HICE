196576,0,t3_1wcsor,So upsetting. At least he lived a very long and very successful life. Let alone being a staple in traditional folk music he helped preserve the genre and the culture by being one of the biggest folk collectors. A successor to the great Alan Lomax Pete Seeger was responsible for pioneering and preserving folk music. He will truly be missed.,folk,cf0tyf5,6,t5_2qi21

1754908,0,t3_2ejgf6,Did he mention anything about the Rise Again concert in Halifax? Kind of sucked that Stanfest was cancelled.      For those not acquainted Stan Rogers was by far one of the most brilliant folk songwriters and died much too young. His music captured the pure essence of the place he spent his summers growing up. If you ever get the chance to visit rural Atlantic Canada do it and listen to some Stan while youre around!,folk,ck0d432,2,t5_2qi21
