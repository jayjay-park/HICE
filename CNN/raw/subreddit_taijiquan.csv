2768610,0,t3_2rrl6t,If youre not doing it as a martial art i must object to claiming that you do tijqun however i see nothing wrong with taking the form from the martial art and practicing it without aspects of violence selfdefence or martial abilities.What you practice if you do not practice a martial art is a set of movements that have been take out of their context of a martial art and thus have lost some of its meaning.All the movments in the form of taijiquan have martial aspects and applications every little detail is part of a system of dealing with violence somehow. And there are more aspects of tijqun then the form which is what people in general take out of context from the martial art.Once again i dont think it is wrong to take out the form and using it as something else then a martial art in fact i think it is good because it will improve your health unless you have other similar practices. I do however like to enlighten people on the fact that it is a martial art and i also oppose calling it tijqun if it is not a martial art. For such practices i suggest saying that you practice the forms from tijqun but taken out of the context of it as a martial art.If you are not practicing as a martial art then the form has already lost its purpose and they way you do it should only hold emphasis on other aspects such as restraining from injury by bad posture. I will start with tips liek these which should apply no matter if you practice tijqun or just the form taken out of context. Keep your spine straight a natural scurve should be present but it should feel as if the spine is straight Make sure your knee is always aligned in a good way not passed over your toes not leaning to any side or twisted somehow pressing your knees outward as if you have a pressuarised big balloon inbetween them when you go into horse stance or we could call them squats if you want is a good idea Also make sure that your feet are pointing in more or less the same way that your knee but not in a way that makes doesnt allow your knee to align in a good way All movements should start and end at the same time. often this means your legs movements and arms movements should start and end at the same time for each techniquemovement in the beginning there might be a point to doing the form rather square in fact many styles have a square form for this very reason and step by step so that one can get the movements sequence and directions right but once one knows the form a bit better it should be continous and flowing. learn the form movement by movement get every movement somewhat right and then just focus on learning the sequence at first you will do your form thousands of times and it will constantly improve. breathe and relax simple but not easy do it at a comfortable speed at first so that you can learn the movements and sequence somewhat without having to focus on what you are actually doing then slow down and focus on what it is that youre actually doing If learning the names is difficult in the beginning skip it for later or if you are not as serious about the art then just skip them entierly. though there is some treasures in the names so if you are interested explore them and learn the meaning and symbology of them but that is for later on if you are serious about the art some postures or movements might seem very strange but make sure you get them right by using the experience of a good teacher. Your body will adapt for better or worse and that is why you need a teacher movement starts from the feet and end in the hands. forcewise not timewise take away anything else you might think you should do they are not important now. Sure tijqun is far more than that but one never cease to learn either in the beginning it is pointless to try to understand everything just focus on the simple things there is a lot in them for a couple of years of practice already. Do form often and not only at class.As for the martial asepcts there are a number of things that are important in the beginning of course all the above things are important if you practice real tijqun aswell. As i said earlier everything is something make sure you get the details somewhat correct. All small movements are there for a reason. Sometimes in the beginning you should just mimik the movemnts because the reason why you do something can go above your head or rather your understanding of the martial aspects but at the same time you should have a basic understanding of the martial applications of all movements they are the key to why you do the movements the way you do them Intent is important you need to be able to use that intent in the form a punch is a punch but you also need to have a calm mind. Find harmony and fierce intent at the same time if you can. Take space when doing applications psychologically it is hard to take someone elses space because we are kind and loving beings but we need to be able to do that in a violent situation but dont force it take you time and feel your training partners balance and experiment you should not have to apply a lot of raw strength. Be soft and learn how to become soft after being hard relax a lot. Softness is not the same thing as relaxing all your muscles you need to use your muscles just dont rely on raw strength but instead try to use as little raw strength as possible. Taoists are lazy intereprete this the right way take your time and work together with your training partners when doing pushing hand excercises applications and snshu and dont be afraid to ask questions. learn how to fall correctly and go along with techniques when someone practices on you. form is important but so is understanding the applications of the form and being able to actually perform the applications however it takes time to learn applications and the step from application towards snshu is ever harder mastering something takes time so spend time on the form but know what the movements are and applications will start to work eventually. read the classics eventualy you will have insights on the meaning of them. Even the simplest statements in the classics can give you multiple revelations over time so just keep reading them from time to time.That should get you started im sure there are plenty of other good tips that i havent come up with yet but i guess other competent people will give more tips. Perhaps we should but things like this in the wiki of the subreddit? I think it is better that way because im very sure my choice of words are far from perfect i did not spend a lot of effort on that and if we keep it in the wiki there would also be the benefit of people more competent than me giving better tips or just other people thinking differently being able to make the tips even greater.,taijiquan,cnis45n,7,t5_2s46h

6722275,0,t1_d0ejzsa,gt Id never really heard of anyone getting to this point before who wasnt famous.Really? I guess that speaks to very low quality of most tai chi in the west. Many of the teachers Ive come across dont have much chi themselves and it seems like the majority of students just do it during class and dont practice much at home.In my mind this is just the first stage of having real internal content in your tai chi. I guess it depends on the teacher but Ive been to workshops where there were at least several people who Id guess have reached this level. Its too bad since I think the practice gets a lot more interesting after this point and there is a much farther to go stillness only being a matter of degree after all.,taijiquan,d0en3e7,3,t5_2s46h

10285310,0,t1_dc6qq74,As Ive mentioned above I really do know where youre coming from since Ive met others just like you who have raised similar questions and doubts.  And in all honestly all your points and concerns and questions and arguments and hesitations are because you havent experienced high level physical Taiji skill and you havent spent time learning from someone who can talk about and teach the mechanics that would produce high level Taiji.  I hope this doesnt come off sounding dismissive since that is not my intent.  This is simply where the gapdisconnect is which is the cause of your disbelief.                  But I can also sympathize with and understand your skepticism and your resistance to accept what Im saying.  If there were some clear and easy way to explain it I would but unfortunately theres no amount of explaining or reading or watching that can be done to make this any clearer.  Im sure I dont need to tell you that many things in Taiji simply need to be experienced physically.  This is just one of those things.   So the best that I can do for you is to urge you to find when CZH is coming to a city near you and attend one of his seminars so that you can feel his skill for yourself first hand.  I should tell you that while I do not know CZH so this is not about me promoting him or any style he possesses high level Taiji skill and is pretty accessible since he regularly travels all over the world including going into other martial arts schools giving seminars.  I am certain that if you were to either push with him or have him demonstrate an application you will immediately feel and will consequently understand what I have been saying.    Going back to the point of CZH stating    gtgt...to generate a degree power and dynamism at least equal to external arts such as boxing.    if we are at least in agreement that Taiji is a legitimate martial art then Taiji must possess the capability of eliminating an opponent with extreme efficiency.  A common phrase for this is to destroy the enemy at the moment of contact.  Taiji constantly gets criticized for not being a real marital art because so few people who practice it can demonstrate any level of credible martial quality equal to what you would expect in any other martial art.  But the truth is real Taiji is off the scales powerful and equal to any other martial art in this regard.    Should you get the opportunity to push with CZH you would experience a latent persistent power that is unquestionably massively destructive and equivalent in force to what any external martial art is capable of generating.  There should be no doubt in your mind that he possesses the skill and power to instantly destroy and put another martial artist regardless of size or experience out of commission.  Not that he would win every fight only that you should be able to clearly sense that he possesses the ability to do so.  Like if you were to face off against a world classhigh level martial artist in Muay Thai or MMA or Karate they may not win every fight but you will know immediately that they possess the ability to quickly finish an opponent.  All high level martial artists of any style should possess this quality.  Taiji is no exception.   I should emphasize that the quality of the power is such that even when performed with low speed and low power the power you receive will still be an overwhelming force.  It isnt the sort of power based on momentum or brute strength where you would think I can see this being powerful if it were done strongerfaster.  Its like if you turned the crank of a meat grinder very slowly it would not take away from the power of the gears doing the grinding and despite there being little power being delivered to the crank the power of the grinder is still incredibly destructive.  It is a persistent overwhelming brutal wrecking force.  You might be asking if I dont know CZH how do I know he possesses this level of destructive ability?  And the answer is because the power is there in the mechanics.  Learning about proper structure and mechanics including understanding of the kua is essential for creating the means for your body to deliver this type and level of force.  These mechanics are not things which are simply going to fall into place if youre Song or have intent.  It must be learned and trained trained until it becomes nd nature.... so no youre not supposed to be thinking about your kua in a real fight.   Well I have to get going and thats also about all I can say about this anyway.  Im sorry that I can not explain this any better for you.  You seem the scholarly sort since you clearly read a lot and youre obviously very passionate about Taiji.  I hope this was helpful at least in a small way but it really comes down to the fact that you need to go and experience high level Taiji for yourself.   ,taijiquan,dc9wa9x,4,t5_2s46h

11102892,0,t1_deq0q0y,Ok I should make a few things very clear. I am not a master of taiji. I have no sparring experience but I do spend a lot of time doing full contact freestyle push hands. There is only one rule during the ph namely do not injure your opponent. Im not looking to show off or become a minor celebrity I like discussing taiji because I love taiji.Ok now thats out of the way I genuinely believe with my current level of internal power holding someones arm with my fingers and then doing a splitting jin to break it is not that difficult. Whether I could actually do it is another story Ive never tested it for obvious reasons.Why do I believe this? Taijis internal power comes from chi and once you acquire the skill of using chi as your main and only source of power in push hands your power increases tremendously. You dont feel like you have become superman but it is the reverse you feel extremely normal actually but suddenly everyone else feels extremely weak. You now find that you can slam someone to the wall but it feels like youve only used  percent of your power reserves. When you come in contact with the opponents body you now feel like you are touching the body of a child. At the moment you will feel like breaking the limbs of that body is not that difficult.I would recommend watching Adam Mizners videos or the videos of his students. Those videos particularly Adams show genuine internal power.,taijiquan,deqi4li,1,t5_2s46h
