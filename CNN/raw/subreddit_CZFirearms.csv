4215975,0,t1_cs0580m,My personal opinion is that unless you have  super duper sensitivity in your finger  its not like it will be a revolutionary experience... but  removing the FPB can allow you to adjust the trigger pretravel and stuff like that  assuming you have an adjustable trigger like the ones from CZCUSTOM and similar suppliers. You also might need to do some fitting to Sear legs and stuff . Some people just take the FPB out and polish it and the channel it rides in  to a mirror finish and I guess it can only get better.  Personally I would just polish it real well  and leave it there. Its a safety and Id rather have it.  ,CZFirearms,cs0szm1,1,t5_2v71v

6827650,0,t3_499whu,gtThe CZ  Combat adds a fully adjustable rear sight extended magazine release dropfree magazine and overtravel adjustment on the trigger. The Combat designation comes from the lack of a firing pin block safety allowing the replacement of the firing pin without tools.As a SP owner heres my thoughts. Fully adjustable rear sight  My SP sights are perfect. They dont need to be adjustable to the CZ levels because theyre dead on I like that theyre fixed and theres less moving parts and the night sights are crazy good. Extended magazine release  I dont know if the SP has this or not but unless I looked at them side by side I dont know how the SP magazine release could be improved. It does what its supposed to do and as far as I can tell I dont know how it can be improved. Drop free magazine  My SP drops free no problem. Overtravel adjustment on the trigger  Heres a big plus for the CZ. That said I bet youd do better dropping a Cajun Gun Works trigger in. But out  of the box the trigger itself on the CZ is going to be better. No firing pin block  Very easy to remove on the SP this sounds like a big thing but its not a big issue if you glance at a tutorial. If you just want this feature standard though CZ is the way to go.SP plus  the rail. Even if you dont mount anything on it the extra weight up front keeps it on target a bit quicker. I like the more aggressive beavertail as well. You can make the firing mechanism better on the SP than the CZ for maybe  but you cant upgrade the CZ to give it a better beavertail or a rail. ,CZFirearms,d0q7pom,6,t5_2v71v
