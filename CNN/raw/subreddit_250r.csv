1323975,0,t1_ciiahm0,gt Im worried people cant hear me with the stock can.  Do not become one of those loud pipes save lives assholes.  It is a total myth and will not help you do anything other than piss people off.  Next time you are in a car and there is a motorcycle in your blind spot take a listen you will not hear them until they are past you.    The HP gains on a  do not exist and unless you are riding on a track dont bother.  It is also much easier to sell a stock bike than one with any modifications.  ,250r,ciikblp,6,t5_2s4o3

1533875,0,t3_2bghnw,I know that feel. Dropped my bike in the driveway after a great  mile ride home from the guy I bought it from. ,250r,cj8jpuq,3,t5_2s4o3
1551904,0,t3_2bzhu1,There are common after market talk light mode mods which flash the tail light when braking. Seems like opportunity for synergy,250r,cjasz7l,5,t5_2s4o3
2115967,0,t1_cl8mtve,This is my thinking as well. OP could fix this thing up without too much trouble especially if the carbs and motor are in good shape. That being said if its the first bike you own you want to spend most of the time riding not wrenching. If it was a second bike I would definitely buy it for  and fix it up. If you do decide to buy it azaiza is right about the ninjette forums. I bought a fixer upper as well just in a bit better shape and that forum and rfixxit helped out a bunch. ,250r,cl8sah3,2,t5_2s4o3
2232027,0,t3_2kbc2n,I did an experiment on I for a few hours when I was riding up from Florida to NJ. I noticed that at mph where I was around k RPM used about  more gas than compared to mph or K RPM.I just feel at that speed the bike really begins to start straining itself so its not surprising that the mileage drops so hard.,250r,clnjl5n,3,t5_2s4o3

3145773,0,t1_co9w1m2,I thought it was crazy you were doing mi oil changes until I looked up the info on it. Ive always been changing mine at  out of habit with synthetic haha,250r,coo213n,1,t5_2s4o3
3446723,0,t3_2znhyk,Ive raced on both started on Bridgestone and then went to Pirelli. At the speeds the  goes I never had a problem with either tire. The Pirelli front is available in  which I recommend because it makes the steering much more precise.,250r,cpl5i4c,2,t5_2s4o3

8934428,0,t3_52lz1x,Yep people like to say this in response to you doing poorly on the bike in any way you dropped it youre unsure of yourself etc. You must just not be cut out for it. Yet people can have unlimited accidents in a car and nobody would ever say the same thing. I feel ya. Listen smile agree and then do whatever the fuck you were gonna do anyway. Unless of course you yourself feel that you would be a danger to yourself and others by getting on the bike. But you know best follow your gut. ,250r,d7lsb6x,6,t5_2s4o3
