48117,0,t1_cejnxqn,Thank you for that response elforesto. Its probably the most rational one Ive ever heard.  Here is my counter if you dont mindThis is a quote I really like from Maynard v. Hill  US   Marriage is not then a contract within the meaning of the clause of the Constitution which prohibits the impairing the obligation of contracts. It is rather a social relation like that of parent and child the obligations of which arise not from the consent of concurring minds but are the creation of the law itself a relation the most important as affecting the happiness of individuals the first step from barbarism to incipient civilization the purest tie of social life and the true basis of human progress.This argues that the relationship formed from a marriage is more than a simple logical give and take contract its more than for the benefit of children or social obligations.  It is the purest tie of social life.  I think this is where most homosexual partners are coming from.  Its not about fairness as much as access to institutionalized acknowledgement of the partner an individual has chosen to experience life with. I read through your other arguments and I agree with you marriage has been dissolving in a lot of ways and I think its partially because weve forgotten what its supposed to be about in the first place.  Having and raising children is a step on lifes path an important one for many people but if you think about it that part of life is only between  and  of the experience most couples are only actively raising children for  years of a year life.  Ideally a marriage would be a commitment that is meant to last longer an overarching relationship of continual support and trust.  Life is a crazy journey to take alone after all which is why I think so many people do get married and prefer the idea whether it is actualized or not that they dont have to do it all by themselves.  What Im suggesting is the idea that the legal institution of marriage was never put in place for the good of the children. It was born out of a deepseeded drive toward loving and being loved in return  of having someone need and be needed by equally.  Naturally children raised in proximity to people experiencing these benefits will be given benefits themselves  growing up in a home where they can see their parents rely on struggle with and grow together while sharing that deeper commitment is good for kids.  However I argue that the drive for companionship came before the institution and the institution was put into place for those partaking in it and other benefits are second hand. Also as a side note anything that can be argued for the good of the children can be used on the other side not as a political platform but for the same reasons you use.  If it is better for children to be raised in a stable home and married parents are the definition of stability it stands to reason that the thousands of children already being raised in households with gay parents ought to be granted access to the same benefits of having those parents married  of having parents committed both to each other and the household theyve built together and having that commitment acknowledged accepted and equally supported by those around them.  ,SaltLakeCity,cejwpki,14,t5_2r7ac

Some states it could be as high as  per year for the pair. You dont think it is ok for the government to force you to pay that is fine. Do you think it is ok for the government to force her to pay? I will assume not because that would be unfair because you dont think the government should interfere. Then those two kids have no education cant write cant do simple math. They roam the streets with no skills and steal harm other people and get into trouble. Then you have to pay for police judicial system and jails. IMO as I stated earlier it has a higher ROI to just educate them till the age of  so that they most likely will be a productive member of society that will be able to pay for the next generation.

The truth lies more on the demand side of the equation hub flights are often direct flights and thats what customers want. In particular the profitable flights for airlines  those for business people  are most often direct. The alternative is a short hop to a hub and then a connecting flight that takes longer and seems much less attractive to the business audience.

So were serving more than just the SLC homeless population and theyre all in one place. It leads to a lot of victimization of the homeless by dealers and the like a huge strain on SLCs services and a general resentment towards the homeless individuals from the people who live nearby.Unfortunately theres no one magic solution.

2782645,0,t1_cnkdgmf,gtNot sure if trolling... but imagine if the officer tased that fucker before swinging the shovel everyone would be crying police brutality.Some have argued that his jacket would have stopped the tazer. Thats the case. But he might have used a pepper spray as he was to take a swing.Officers are probably taught to stand their ground and their training likely centers around that. But a mentally ill person is not going to understand that. I think the best procedure would have been to recognize the possibility of mental illness then back away hence deescalating wait for back up. Then disarm the shovel from him.Perhaps the policeman should have recognized that the shovel could be used as a weapon when he first saw it which did show that the police officer was trying to be patient though. That might have been the mistake on his behalf. Or that he might be dealing with an irrational person on the outset. Clearly the man was probably aggressively pan handling considering the walks were dry. So perhaps more situational awareness?I think this is why body cams are important  so we can have this discussion. There were others in a different forum arguing against their use!

Im a big fan of the larger houses and attached garages the proximity to the cottonwood canyons and there are cool shops and restaurants out here you left out Brittons Royal India and Tokyo Sushi. Ill probably move back to Sandy eventually or maybe Suncrest so I can claim I live on a mountain.I feel like Sandys just another suburb though. Like every suburb Ive lived in theres some cool stuff buried in all the subdivisions strip malls and chain stores and you pretty much have to drive because our mass transit sucks out here. The appeal of downtown is that you can reduce your driving significantly by walking to work restaurants and bars and using your car for bigger shopping trips or rides out to the canyons. Im also pretty meh on Sugarhouse. Its like the bars and restaurants of downtown but with the commuting of a suburb. Id rather have the bigger housegarage and just drive.Honestly my ideal situation would be to live out in the burbs take TRAX downtown and drive everywhere else.

Utah is one beautiful place and the people here are very nice. I love it here. Our downtown is small but full of great restaurants and bars. Id suggest getting food at Seigfrieds Delicatessen. Its downtown. Sit at any open spot at the bar and youll face the outside. Youll see people walking the city and get yourself a good German meal. Welcome to Utah.

You can work compost Home Depot has a big pink and yellow bag that I like locally sourced and cheaper than Costco wear a mask a fungal lung infection doesnt sound fun and peat moss into the soil right now.  You can start sprouting tomatoes peppers and anything else in your greenhouse.  Watch for freezes.  You could wrap a blanket around the greenhouse and put one on top if it gets super cold.  Maybe check the temperature some cold mornings and see if it is retaining its heat well.  If you dont want to mess with seeds you can buy starters from Smiths hardware stores or IFA  You could actually plant things like squash and cucumbers right now if you use a wall of water I have to buy these from Smiths Marketplace in the winter because they sell out so fast but any hardware store may have them.  Buy a cheap timer a cheap hose and an extra male end.  Cut the hose to the length needed to get it to your garden and put the male end on it.  Then you can attach drip hoses to that and the timer to your faucet.  So much easier to just set that thing for  minutes and walk away and you wont forget about it and flood your garden.  This year has been so warm so far that I thought about starting my peppers with walls of water and a blanket thrown over them if it gets too cold.  I wanted to see if I could get a couple extra months of growing time out of them.  In the end its all kind of an experiment youll probably try different things next year.EDIT note that the average planting time are based on just planting them out in the open.

Heres his full comment on his Facebook pagegt Several months ago I met a man named Derek Kitchen at the passing of gt Utahs SB bill. What an incredible man. He had a light and spirit about him that I knew was real. After exchanging phone numbers he text me the next day asking how I was holding up from the whole parade deal. Again very genuine.gt gt Since then we have stayed in touch several times trying to figure out ways to bring our community together even through the disagreements we may have. Out of the blue he invited me to his wedding. I admit I was taken back. The first thought that came to my mind was would you go to your childs wedding if they were gay? I thought of my kids and the answer was yes.gt gt He then came into my work at the Sutherland Institute and hand delivered the wedding invitation. It just felt right for me. I explained to him my beliefs on marriage and told him I didnt want to take away from his day even though I didnt believe in gay marriage he still said he wanted me there. I knew I had to learn something.gt gt A friend soon asked the same question I would have asked myself as to how me going to a gay wedding and riding in front of the gay pride parade are any different?? All I will say is the wedding had appropriate clothing no certain behaviors on floats and messages that didnt mock God. I believe theres is a way to support an individual without supporting a particular cause that individual is about. This wedding was pretty classy and I even tried hummus for the first time. Mmm.gt gt I didnt go as a man in a state uniform seemingly being used for a political statement. I wasnt in the ceremony. I stood on the sidelines like I would have done at the pride parade for protection of their rights. I went to this wedding as an individual for an individual who invited me two great individuals Derek and Moudi.

Usually when we write about people surviving avalanches its because they had the right gear training and a plan. Not everyone who is prepared makes it but its not uncommon for folks to die in ways that could have been prevented with a little preparation. Im no expert on gear so Im not trying to endorse this specific equipment or anything but Ive written about beacons and probes saving lives more than a handful of times and would urge anyone who recreates in Utahs great outdoors to plan ahead pack the right gear including more water than you think you need and ALWAYS TELL SOMEONE WHERE YOU ARE GOING AND WHEN YOU EXPECT TO BE BACK. ,SaltLakeCity,cs6jsgb,2,t5_2r7ac

No man in western music today speaks to the heart with the passion and intensity that Lee Fields does. Thats why I put him at . I only know that the bands you mentioned are popular in indie rock.

4583218,0,t3_3dja2s,Im of the opinion that another highrise wont seriously make or break SLC as a metro area. But you asked so lets be serious... after all why not?The mountains dwarf everything here. You could rebuild the  ft tall Burj Khalifa in Salt Lake  it would look enormous compared to the rest of downtown and rise well above Ensign peak but it would still feel smaller than the Wasatch mountains rising high in the east. Also its well beyond the budget of our midsize city. The goal should also be to have a skyline that doesnt yell out blah like Denver or LA. Iconic buildings like the Sears tower in Chicago the John Hancock tower in Chicago or the Columbia Seafirst tower in Seattle are what we should go for. Im partial to spires  I think skyscrapers should not have any particular religious significance but we want something that would harmonize with the Salt Lake temple the tower of City Hall and the dome of the capitol. Philadelphia and Atlanta have pretty nice skylines with pyramidal spireheavy buildings. Rather than just another office tower one could build a high end urban condo tower like Jeanne Gangs Aqua building in Chicago. Perhaps something that combines residential and office space? Ideally Id want to see a building that provides mixeduse capability and symbolizes the contrasts we see in Utah the pious LDS culture vs opportunistic intermountain west the rocky mountains meeting the great basin i.e. mountains meeting desert. Perhaps a lowerelevation slanted buildings like a more vertical design similar to the city library would fit the bill in SLC?

When the outdoor temperature is the same as my house I turn off the AC and open windows. Cooler temperatures at night keep the inside cooler as well. I do not close windows until the outdoor temperature in about  degrees. The inside will still be a bit cooler and I can keep that cooler air for a bit longer by closing windows and running the fans.Like uHatuutaH said check to see if you can go on the equal payment plan as that makes a big difference over the year as you do not get a big surprise bill during the summer months.

Before you get too hung up on what type of car to buy understand that the two most important factors to driving safely in the snow are common sense and tires.  Purchase a set of studless snow and ice tires and you will be fine in any reliable FWD or AWD vehicle.  If you are nervous about your skills as a driver after the first snow of the season find an empty parking lot and practice.  Despite popular opinion you do not have to buy an AWD Subaru to drive in the winter here.   In terms of brands...Honda Toyota VW and Subaru all make dependable cars.  If you are buying a used car at a dealer try to buy a car that is certified and always ask to see the carfax report. If you are buying from a private seller have it inspected by a mechanic before you buy.Good luck.   ,SaltLakeCity,d06hmhl,3,t5_2r7ac

6705604,0,t3_47fo4n,The market in UT is completely saturated with real estate investors. UT is infamous for all of its MLM type companies. There are no shortage of real estate investor schools or mentorship programs here. I worked for a whole seller for  months straight making cold calls to people looking for houses to buy. One time we found a perfect deal and the next day we talked to the home owner they told us that they received an offer from their neighbor that was about  k higher that wanted to flip it. Does it matter to the seller that the neighbor will lose a ton of money? no. Will the neighbor never try to flip a house again? probably. But there more and more people just like those neighbors.When you get here you will notice that there are more hand written bandit signs that say Real Estate Investor seeks trainee k year salary or similar  than you will see we buy housesor similar.But like any market no matter how saturated someone is doing it and someone is making money doing it. If you want you can PM me your email and I can get you in touch with some really good people. Im actually really good friends with someone that loans money. I just wanted to give you the heads up about the saturation if you didnt already know.,SaltLakeCity,d0cx1b8,2,t5_2r7ac

Then I went to an interview with the sixth company since moving here and it happened. I checked every box. All requirements. I had more experience than they needed in every category all the skills they could dream of and more. On my way out the door the guy pats me on the shoulder and sort of rubs in a circular motion. I was shocked. I had been warned but I was really taken aback. Sure enough I get called and was told I lacked the qualifications. Say I wasnt the right fit. Say you found a better candidate. But when you tell me I dont have the qualifications even though I have all the paper ones and demonstrate knowledge on every question you ask something else is going on. Ive interviewed a lot and I KNOW my weaknesses. I didnt have any when it came to what they were looking for. I wont say the guys name but this was for EMC.

7166194,0,t3_4dmma7,Just moved here from MI  months ago with my girlfriend and we love it.  Just a few thoughts based on your post... Job market is very strong compared to MI my girlfriend was able to lineup a job at the U of U before we moved and I got replies from the first  applications I submitted but ended up keeping my job in MI and work remotely.  ITtech sector is strong. Youll want to live close to downtown if you want to be close to culturenightlife.  Sugar house th and th the avenues and Liberty park are all hip progressive neighborhoods with plenty to do.  Im renting so Im not sure about housing market. Weather is better than MI we have a winter here but its not nearly as bad as MI more sunny days a little warmer and less snow.  It is pretty dry out here though. In terms of hiking I dont know if there is a better city in America to live in for hiking...its amazing here. Im not sure about the nightlife are you talking clubs?  If so not my thing so I cant answer that.  I do enjoy having drinks at barslounges and for Utah having such a bad rep in regards to weird liquor laws Ive been pleasantly surprised with the bar scene.  SLC has a respectable craft beer scene as well....not quite like MI but pretty solid.   Youll probably get an additional month or two of motorcycle weather out here.  I drive a sports car and I enjoy taking it out to the desert roads west of town and letting it loose.  Lots of great twisty driving roads up in the mountains too.  some random things....inversions suck people drive like idiots here...not in an aggressive way but in a clueless way Mormons arent that bad fry sauce is good but pace yourself Vegas is only  hours away.,SaltLakeCity,d1sq7wh,7,t5_2r7ac

But you dont sign further into The Social Contract when you participate in society any more than a slave consents to slavery by not trying to escape or not refusing to work.Also the rules of society regarding the electoral college as written in the constitution are basically The Electors of The Electoral College choose who they will appoint as president after considering the will of their population and all other relevant factors. Faithless electors are not breaking Federal or Constitutional Law by voting against the will of the people. And if and when they break their own states anifaithless elector laws which many states dont have they still have the constitutional right to have that vote counted before being sentenced to prison andor fined by their state.No matter what way you slice it the fact is that Donald Trump has not been appointed to be president by the people who ACTUALLY decide.

Its fun and you really just need a smartphone and an app.  In geocaching people hide little containers around the real world  some small enough to just hold a piece of paper you can sign to say lostslcdogs was here others big enough to hold all kinds of fun trinkets.  Then they go to geocaching.com or maybe others?  I dont know and list the GPS coordinates of the thing they placed with a name and a description and maybe a hint.  Using your GPSenabled device you go to those coordinates in the real world and try to find the thing they hid sign the log swap trinkets and mark on the website that you were there.  You dont have to mark down which ones youve been to but it helps you remember which ones youve done.If youre on Android cgeo is a good free app. There are tons of caches down near Jordan River in parks etc. and its not snowy enough yet to be a real problem.

The first time you use your benefits this is lower and will rise for subsequent loans.
