257957,0,t1_ceugg8r,Apparently before I started school I did EVERYTHING left handed. Then in school I guess I was taught to write with my right hand. I was fussed at over my handwriting for all of elementary school and part of middle. Id still get a teased a little about it but not fussed at by teachers in high school and stuff. I now write things in both hands though through lack of practice my left hand is a little slower but neatness wise theyre both the same. I also seem to draw better with my left hand. I shoot both guns and bows left handed though I can still use the right handed recurve I have fairly easily. Buying a lefty compound bow sucks especially since Im not tall enough to use a mens bow and most youth bows arent balanced super well so I had to try and find a ladies bow in a left hand. I did not get to shoot it before I ordered it. Fortunately it ended up being AMAZING but Im getting off track.I do most every day things ambidextrously. If Im cooking the utensil is in whatever hand is most convenient such as if Im cooking eggs and need to go in from a certain angle to flip them Ill swap hands. When Im using my computers touch pad Ill swap hands depending on what Im doing. A good example is I was just using my right hand to navigate and eating cheezits with the other but when I pulled out just broken ones I poured them into my right hand to avoid spilling and then navigated left handed while I ate out of my right.,southpaws,cf7hsah,3,t5_2ruq7
