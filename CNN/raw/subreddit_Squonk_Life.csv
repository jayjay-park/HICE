6822905,0,t3_497nrq,The NoName NoPain is an extremely well built and slick looking mm atty. It comes with a stainless steal and black delrin top cap as well as a  to  ring. The main problem that most people have is the . mm air hole being to tight. I decided to Drill mine out with a  bit equivalent to .mm. This was slightly more difficult  a job due to the air flow going under the deck.It ended splitting on the lower level of of the deck. I also went through nipple at the end which I did not intend do. Doing the the top caps was straight forward and .mm fit perfectly between the two indents for the Orings.After some cleaning with a metal file then soap and water I put a  wrap g .mm ID build in.Aside from aesthetics it turned out extremely well. Its still mouth to lung but much more in the mold of a Kayfun lite than Hellfire. At  watt with the . ohm build its a very warm flavorful vape.,Squonk_Life,d0pob6j,2,t5_3cuua

6973853,0,t1_d16t6lj,Yeah probably not much the button doesnt stick out very far. As long as its the only thing in your pocket youd have to lean up against something pretty hard to get it to fire. The only time Ive really used the lock was when rewicking.,Squonk_Life,d16tnsj,2,t5_3cuua
7549265,0,t1_d30aurm,Not a problem! If you are really set on a mech BF Reos are pretty hard to beat and Rob is a great guy to deal with. I know hes releasing some of the new Ps sometime shortly if youre looking for the new hotness and hes a super nice guy to deal with. You wont be disappointed.,Squonk_Life,d30bcun,2,t5_3cuua

7600570,0,t1_d34j0zs,gtNo? Thats interesting being that they serve the same purpose as authentics for generally far less moneyThat tends to be the case for many counterfeit products. A fake Rolex still tells the time. But would you buy one instead of a Timex or Casio? gtIve yet in my five years vaping to see an atty worth .So dont buy those products then. Most of the real innovation in rebuildable atomizers comes from passionate modders. Those modders often produce their products more locally and to a very high standard forcing a high price. The margins on production like that are fairly low too. What China is good at on the other hand these days is taking inspiration from those designs and iterating it like mad. Tweaks get incorporated revisions get better. They share and mash up Tsunami  Velocity  Kennedy for example. And they also drive production cost very far down. So why fuck with a fake Rolex when you could have Casio that sets itself via radio signal! ,Squonk_Life,d365a56,1,t5_3cuua
7622307,0,t1_d3834d8,I agree fully with this assessment. If I had a mod I loved that was mm only I may have held on to it. Its not that it was bad in any sense just not as good for my wantsneeds as other stuff I have.,Squonk_Life,d38m6v5,1,t5_3cuua
8310065,0,t3_4t2d2g,Hi everyone relatively new Vaper and already sick of carrying around a bottle of juice and paper towels and Ive heard that squonking can give big flavor which I crave. Im looking for suggestions for a good first squonking kit. Only thing I would want as a must have is the ability to use premade coils.  Currently I dont reaply have an interest in building my own.  Thanks in advance   ,Squonk_Life,d5gbcjr,4,t5_3cuua
9363002,0,t1_d92kg3n,Haha i had success but with the opposite positioning in mine. I dropped the coil lower maybe a hair higher than being parallel with the airflow holes and it has been heavenly ever since!,Squonk_Life,d92tt1a,4,t5_3cuua
9392954,0,t1_d8w90f9,Ill second this.  Partly because of the sleeker simpler look.  Mostly because of the bottle.  The Therion has a bottle with a lid the tub fits through just like the Halcyon.  The Inbox has a press fit bottle similar to the dripboxes.,Squonk_Life,d96mghk,1,t5_3cuua
