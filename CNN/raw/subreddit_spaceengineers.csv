I really like the interior but struggled to get things the way I wanted on the outside.Handles pretty well didnt want to go mad with the engines so inertial dampening could be better. Its pretty nimble so having an issue docking small ships in the hangar!

559306,0,t1_cg3ujpg,I definitely like the idea of automation. It has to be carefully balanced though. Maybe the developers can tack it on as the updates progressively come to work it all out. First things like the conveyer belts then maybe autominers and even shipyards later?Definitely like the idea of a shipyard. We need some factorization going on eventually imo. Especially in multiplayer or if hostile AI are added. Imagine taking heavy damage during battle landing in your shipyard and small droneslaserwhatever slowly repairing the ship back to what it was based on the saved schematic?.

During their last live QampA the boss guy mentioned he doesnt want a larger team because they are difficult to manage and he doesnt want people to alter the direction of the game. That doesnt sound like good leadership to me...a good manager with experience will be able to manage a team or delegate to trusted individuals while still acting as creative director. I mean Chris Roberts is managing a game with more than  people working on it and he makes EVERY big decision maybe even all!Im saying it sounds to me like the developers of SE are either inexperienced have had a bad experience which is holding them back or are incapable of expanding. But the results will show all Kerbal Space Program is still developed by an extremely small team and its making leaps and bounds all the time.

In a combat situation in space engineers if you had two crews of  one having dedicated positions pilot engineer mechanic weapons commander  fighter pilots and the other has one main pilot and one weapons officer with  fighter pilots assuming identical carriers the team with  fighters is going to wreck.

Have two perpendicular fields and it will only move on one axis have three perpendicular fields and it will remain stationary.Imagine it like the opposite of a gravity generator. Instead of causing things to move in a direction it causes them to not move in a direction.Note I may have the circuit component incorrect as Im terrible at Electromagnetic Physics.

920311,0,t1_ch8uj4d,gt I have not looked into how it works in this instanceI think my point has been misconstrued  I am not suggesting there is a hard coded voxel map where each block in that  cube is represented. I am pointing out that in principle a station with width  x  with a rotor at one end and a small reactor at the other should theoretically work and would have to be processed as a single object so its physics can be calculated. They are after all a single contiguous object. I am simply saying  ditch the master grid  introduce a gameplay mechanic for aligning blocks of either size instead and  impose an upper limit on the size of all  grid types either directly e.g.  cube OR by some proxy like the mass of the ship. That will make resource allocation more predictable allowing for more resources to be deployed onto things like handling faster travel and larger universes. gt The actual solution for it most likely involves converting the engine to doubleprecision floating point.I agree with this entirely and doubleprecision floating point would be a good way forward. I alluded to this when I mentioned a cartesian system would work well as you could effectively double the size of the possible universe as I think there is an upper limit of  or something like that.

The design is meant to keep the front end of the ship between the cockpit and the target ship the gatlings can fire around the ships bow and the rocket launchers in the front four of them can devastate most ships pretty quickly.To track the design after my initial test run I replaced destroyed armor blocks with white heavy armor blocks.

Id like to join because I enjoy the prospect of playing with others but public servers have way too many griefers that break things for the sake of breaking. The server also has good multipliers not a fan of high mults for inv refinery etc. The East coast thing is also really good since lag tends to be an issue.I may be interested in starting a faction yes.

1375950,0,t3_29um3a,I completely agree. I like cargo ships because it adds a bit of life to a game and gives you a potential for some quick resources if you want them. But theyre currently too easy to abuse. And when you CAN abuse something its hard to resist abusing something.Im playing a server for the first time with one of my friends and he has great ideas in his mind to make super carriers and mega stations and the whole nine yards. But I feel kind of distressed when he has  cargo ships hovering over our platform lined up for scrapping because its  times easier than mining the mats and making the stuff from scratch. And for context we dont even have a large scale ship to speak of yet just a handful of small ones. I can control myself sure but I can only do so much to encourage my friend to hold back so theres at least some challenge to survival building. I agree that they need to be tougher to crack. Guns that target anything outside of its cargo ship faction and not just moving objects would be a great start. Like it has been said in other posts its too easy to get on an intercept come to a complete stop then hose a turret or two and enable yourself a safe way to get to one side of the ship. I also agree that they need to be less frequent. Ive caught myself a few times thinking instead of going mining Im going to wait around on the platform for a cargo ship to spawn in. I mean space piracy is definitely a cool aspect of Space Engineers. But I really think there should be a frequency adjustment option just like there is for inventory space and refinery speed. Like realistic it will be reasonably rare for ships to happen by like maybe once every hour or two. And then have X and X. Another thing I was thinking is that there should be fighter escorts especially for the larger ships and especially especially for the military ships. Granted I understand the game isnt quite up to having AI yet. But I think this would be an excellent way to handle this. Instead of fighting a turret that has a maximum range and blind spots. Make it so there are some simple fighters that will come after you. Have it so they chase you a few thousand meters away from the mother ship. That would not only make scrapping the big ship more rewarding because youd actually have to fight for it but it would make it more lucrative because you also have fighters you can tow in after you beat them up. This could also create some exciting dogfighting options for small servers between friends like mine. Its fun making fighters and all but whats the point unless were going to fight each other. As of right now you dont necessarily need a fighter to take out these ships.Another AI related option would be that nonmilitary ships wouldnt stand and fight you. Make it so the private sails the business freighters and the mining ships would try to haul ass out of there. So you have to attempt to disable them to bring them to a stop. Thatd make latching on to them and using your own ships inertia dampeners much more difficult.All in all I really do like having cargo ships enabled because it presents more opportunities and a less lonely world even on multiplayer. I understand we can easily say well just dont abuse it but thats easier said than done when youre playing with someone so ambitious about their projects that they dont care how much they abuse the system short of going into creative mode. ,spaceengineers,ciorfum,5,t5_2ygas

If you could just simply not build within a certain distance of the gate then a person could build a mobile gun platform that would ambush the gate.

1697473,0,t1_cjt2cps,Well theres a number of assumptions that can be made which definitely make this possible.Firstly you can assume that all space that isnt in the volume of a ship or station is just  water. So you dont need to simulate any of that only spawn water into the edge of the voxel grids of shipsstations.Secondly you dont need to do point cloud simulations. Your water doesnt need to be realistically tiny but instead only needs to be the size of the smallest possible thing in the game  so a voxel and anything smaller than a full voxel like a keypad is considered nonexisting to the water systemThirdly you dont need to do complex physical interaction between water particles. Instead you can run a cellular automata and some of those can be very fast indeed made by a good friend of mines.Its definitely not impossible!,spaceengineers,cjt4om3,2,t5_2ygas

1716574,0,t1_cjvj39a,The game doesnt currently let you set a target velocity. Im assuming youve tried turning off the thrust entirely? In a perfect world turning the trust off entirely would lead to the satelite maintaining speed while going in a circle. In reality it probably comes to a stop. While leaving the thrust on leads to the thing hitting max velocity. I dont think there is currently a way to get around that until better control is put into the game.

2400304,0,t1_cm82ymp,Power. Do you know how much more efficient gravity drives are than thrusters? In the same amount of space you can fit either twelve large thrusters or  mass blocks and  gravity generators.. MN of thrust versus . MN. I believe I did that math properly.Thrusters are more controllable but for a main source of thrust gravity drives become much more efficient very quickly.In fact a single small thruster takes up two blocks and provides  N of force while a single mass block and gravity generator provides  N. Much more efficient even on the smallest scale so long as I havent been goofing up the math.Edit Okay I accidentally used small ship thrusters in a few calcs. I also decided to check how much literal power it takes to generate  MN of thrust using the three main methodsSmall thrusters large thrusters and gravity drives. This is for large ships only and assumes you are using thruster override.Small Thruster  KN uses  Kw of power. . MN per KN so it takes  KW of power to generate  MN with Small Thrusters.Large Thrusters . MN . MW of power. . . x .  . MW. Convert to KW exactly the same amountAssuming .  KW of power per MN with Large Thrusters.Gravity Engines become more and more efficient with the amount you have but Im just going to do the bare minimum to get as close to  MN of force as is reasonable.We already know they provide . MN of thrust per gravity unit x gives us . MN of thrust. For the extra . MN we could figure out how low to set a third gravity generator but it is not that important. KW or . MW per mass block . MW per gravity generator. So  KW worst case scenario or if you were half intelligent and just used two mass blocks and one gravity generator  KW.Thats about x the power consumption for just  MN and we didnt even hit exactly one MN. So Gravity Drives arent quite as energy efficient as the thrusters on a really small scale.But thats not the strength of Gravity Generators.Lets try and get  MN of thrust out of the thrusters.  x    KW of power. Whereas Gravity Drives using only one Gravity block and  Mass BlocksYou can fit  Mass Blocks in a x space and thats only  dimensional your new drain will be .  . or  KW of power. Much more efficient now its roughly five times as efficient as the thrustersNot necessarily space wise but you have to have some use for the interior of the giant mass of floating steel you made. You could also use roughly the same amount of power as thrusters with five gravity generators instead of one and only need to find space for  mass blocks instead of  mass blocks or  small thrusters.I may have a math problem.,spaceengineers,cm8dwdm,7,t5_2ygas

2420417,0,t3_2n6ck2,I have never personally done a mod exactly like this but I think I know how to do it. I will start this by saying that I dont think it is possible to overwrite tabs that modsKeen already added. You should be able rename them and add other objects into them though. You are also able to add new tabs with specific blocks in them you should be able to reference blocks from other mods as well. You are correct that it is a fairly easy mod to do as all it does is add one text file however it is a very tedious text file to create.The file you want to recreate for a mod like this is called BlockCategories.sbc and it can be found in your steamsteamappscommonSpaceEngineersContentData folder. This file can be opened with notepad. Every entry between each ltCategory xsi...gt and ltCategorygt is what defines a tab in the gmenu. Keep in mind that while you can edit this file directly I dont recommend it because it will only affect your game and if you mess something up it could break your game. So you will need to learn how to make a mod folder for Space Engineers. To do this you must go to UsersusernameAppDataRoamingSpaceEngineersMods and create a folder with the name you want your mod to have if AppData is not visible you must enable hidden items this is done in windows  by checking the hidden items box in the view tab of the file explorer. This folder must be setup in the same way as the Content folder in the Space Engineers directory. So for your mod all it should contain is a folder called Data with your modified BlockCategories.sbc inside of said Data folder. If you have set your mod folder up correctly it should be visible in the mod selection screen in Space Engineers with a different icon indicating that it is a local file. So now when you modify the BlockCategories file you can load up Space Engineers to see your work as you go you must reload your world after any modifications to refresh your mod. I just realized that the rest of the stuff you will need to do is probably too complicated to explain in a reddit comment... Without going into much detail you must also look at the CubeBlocks.sbc file there is one in the Space Engineers data folder and there should also be one in every mod that adds a block to the game. The ltstringgt entry in the BlockCategories file refers to the ltSubtypeIDgt entry in the CubeBlocks file. Something worth noting is that the game will load the vanilla BlockCategories file in addition to your modded one and any other modded ones that are loaded. So deleting a ltCategorygt or ltstringgt from your modded file will not have an effect on the game.Hopefully this is enough to get you started on your mod. If you have any questions feel free to add me on Steam my username is the same as on reddit. It will be a lot easier to explain in a Steam chat.,spaceengineers,cmavf07,2,t5_2ygas

If youre covering it in heavy armor reactor mass is a small percentage but then they have better protection anyway.

So suggestionsI would like to see all of that nice open space on the roof of the ship used up for something.Personally I like open landing decks and would use that for my fighters or drones. Alternatively if you are a moving base I would add some landing gear so you can stabilize captured ships as you chop them down.For the bottom of the ship I would extend it a few blocks more down and add a repair arm for those ships that are docked.Anyways great idea.  ,spaceengineers,cn3rn20,2,t5_2ygas

3006747,0,t3_2um7jd,So this started as an idea that came about from trying to generate optimal and efficient gravity fields in tubes and on catwalks. Innitially we intended to create a block that would create  cube of gravity .m while still retaining use of the cube. Some technical limitations with the API actually prevented us from implementing the technical limitations required to limit power consumption and maximum field size so it still retains all the functionality of a regular gravity generator. Its just squished.This was our first real mod and something we thought we could hammer out in a couple weeks as a trial run.  months later here we are.It was definitely fun to play around with.

3123108,0,t1_coloyjw,Oh yeah the CoM isnt very well aligned. I mean it is good but not very good yet. So considering you want to balance the forward thrust only now you need to properly align the thruster CoMs equidistant to the ships CoM on a single straight line on the plane whos normal is the forward direction.  So if you look at the ship from behind of the front you should be able to draw a staight line through both thruster CoMs and the ships CoM.    I hope that helps and doesnt sound overly complicated or mathematical.    Edit  To change the CoM the easiest way is to relocate the rotors if your CoM is off by more than one block. If it is less redistribute the masses to change the CoM.    CoM Center of Mass,spaceengineers,colpj95,1,t5_2ygas

3166518,0,t3_2wbpyl,To give some ideas for benefits that could be offered by not wearing space suits inside ships Walk faster without a suit Certain devices can only be used and manipulate without a suit for example perhaps a special cockpit chair Suits will not lose power when they are not being worn. Therefore if you have a way to not use your suit but can stay in an airtight space you can survive much longer. Perhaps implementing sleeping on survival mode would be beneficial. It would put a lot more emphasis on having a well built ship to survive meteor strikes during your sleep cycle. Custom character models even with a basic degree of customizable characters people would have a large incentive to take off their suits. People like to be unique and when your wearing a suit your the same as everyone else. If the nonsuit human could be customized people would want to see that custom modelSuits can be damaged Give suits a healthshield rating. If they are hit by too much enemy fire they can lose functionality maybe vision becomes impaired motion slower inertial dampening worse jetpack thruster become disabled limited oxygen etc. Suits would have to be brought back to the ship to be repaired and thus taken off. Making suits very resource intensive to build would ensure that players would want to avoid leaving their suits damaged. Make it take a while for a suit to be repaired in survival.Make suits customizableimprovable You dont have to change any models per say but make suit strength color speed jump height oxygen storage power storage etcimprovable. However making an improvement takes a long time so while the suit is being improved players cant wear it. If they take the suit out the improvement is stalled.Create better POV. Space Engineers makes great use of POV for things like small ships. However when your in a suit everything is perfectly clear. This should change. From now on when your in a suit it should look like your looking through a helmet. This will significantly increase immersion but will also add incentive to at least take your helmet off when your inside a ship because you want the clarity that an unencumbered face will grant you.Charging suits has variety You can charge your suit while wearing it this will supply a limited charge when at max charge. Having a visible countdown of suit power remaining will add urgency and thrill to the game. Or your can charge your suit without someone inside of it suit is toggled off and placed in a suit charger machine suit will be given a longer lasting charge when at full charge however it also takes longer to reach that point.,spaceengineers,coq7ib7,11,t5_2ygas

3184982,0,t3_2wkzpc,I have some experience here. If you want a survival ready ship the options are few. One is to use the large advanced rotor as a base and then put a conveyor and then another advanced rotor. You then just stick a remote and a gyro on it as well as large misile launchers. You can design the rest.For a small ship turret you can use connectors but I dont think its stable enough. If you are okay with a creative version of this.... I got something.  Using the large to small rotor hack you can make a firing system that fires  missiles in the place of one large ship turret. Replace the large ship launchers with that and your enemies are gone.Also look into sensor turrets.,spaceengineers,cos4g6k,1,t5_2ygas

3307118,0,t1_cp562dl,Most sandbox games have no goal. The good ones have things to do but people too often expect specific guidance and a screen that says The End in sandbox games and thats not how they work. Linear titles have stories progression that follows that story and drives your character to the main goal the end and sometimes optional and side objectives. I dont believe these two can be mixed with a lot of great effect. The old Fallout games used to put ends on their games but they couldnt wrap up the optional and side objective progresses relative to the main story so it ended your game. Dying Light recently tried to put an optional heavily cinematic ending on the game and people gave them a lot of crap for it.Sandboxes arent meant to have an end or an ultimate goal. If they did then that would be the primary focus of the game and it would no longer be a sandbox. And its when people come into sandbox titles and start demanding to be told what to do that they start deviating from the sandbox theme and turn into something that only serves a part of the community that doesnt like sandbox games but hasnt figured it out yet.,spaceengineers,cp58l9u,5,t5_2ygas

However there are two things I want to point outFirst since almost all the combat ships in a world with railgun mod enabled will have railguns on them  I do not think the sit back and snipe tactic is valid hereonce the enemy notice your presence their capitol ships will try to countersnipe you and their corvettes and fighters will try to swarm you.Second with  railguns this ship is going to be a high priority target once it shows up on battlefield. You may need to either make it less obvious paint and holographic camouflage or assign several dedicated AA ships to keep it safe from enemy fighters.Now a name and class for this beauty. Baal the name of the supreme god worshiped in ancient Canaan and Phoenicia should be a good name for her.

Most importantly pirates. There are a few space station checkpoints in which you can further improve the main ship or the small ships with what you may or may not have salvaged from the pirates.At the end you deliver the important cargo to the station and you can even have a score based on how big the final ship is when it arrives to the final station! it could be your highscore in a leaderboard.,spaceengineers,cq92a8p,0,t5_2ygas

My point is  and i dont know who thinks like me but  mods are supposed to be free they are the attractive part for people with no money and cant afford dlc normally. Now with this mods become dlc and cost money and unless the game has multiplayer people like me see no reason to spend money on a game when you need to spend even more money just to enjoy it a bit more.  I know how greedy a person can be and how all the good and worthwhile mods are hard to make meaning that the only free thing in the workshop will be small mods like i dont know maybe some mod that allows another color on a block while all the good mods that add stuff to the game will cost money and i can no longer consider those things mods but dlc that i dont have the money to afford therefore the game is just the game it self and unless space engineers develops a nice single player plot or scenarios free ones because there can also be paid ones if they go with paid mods  or require paid mods i dont see any incentive to buy a game when i need to spend more money.  and im just talking of games that use a lot of mods like space engineers   without mods space engineers doesnt have many options and parts right now.,spaceengineers,cqotm0b,0,t5_2ygas

The one Valve and Bethesda set up was universally agreed to be bad.

3849165,0,t1_cqusep4,Honestly I think that this is how this game works is how we will actually make things work in the farish future.Basically things that you come in contact with will have sound because the vibrations will be felt through your body. These sounds will be super muted and distorted but will be there this includes ship vibrations and stuff when youre in a ship.On top of this I think in the future we will have dedicated computer systems to simulate sound. Ie it examines the environment and simulates sound that you would here if there was oxygen with speakers. Why would we do this? Well firstly Ill keep people from going insane which is always a big plus but secondly itll help us react faster to things we might not see which is crucial in an environment where every second matters.Having said that I would love to see a modoption for this game which make the sound system a close approximation of at least the first portion. ,spaceengineers,cqv1f34,9,t5_2ygas

3884825,0,t1_cqz333a,Yeah my original approach to this involved full management of refinery workload moving stuff out as well as in.The problem is that statetracking of dozens of containers and refinery inventories is computationally expensive when you start needing to move things in both directions ie. finding room to dump a stack somewhere in a few hundred containers which may mostly be full. Its all too easy to end up with some On algorithm or worse. A sizeable chunk of my script exists to build lookup tables etc to ensure that it only needs to iterate the containers once and can locate ore stacks via direct lookup. I like my scripts to scale to thousands of containers because small ones are so much more spaceefficient than large ones.There are other solutions to the scaling problem eg. you could designate dump containers which the script can rely on to remain fairly empty so it doesnt need to hunt around so much.I pretty much gave up on that first attempt though. A few hours later inspiration struck again and yielded a lean approach in which each refinerys backlog is small enough that it clears in seconds anyway so it will adjust to sudden changes in demand within an iteration or two.

It only did it at the beginning of the video in the later tests the bouncy light thing didnt occur if you watch for it.It wasnt an intentional feature though sorry to say. It may have something to do with the air level fluxuating because it was passing through a door instead of an empty block or it may have just been a timing or graphical thing unrelated to the script itself.

To get helium you would need to build a special pump that pumps it out of the planets atmosphere Which would also contain oxygen. To assist with determining if a planet is habitable or has helium you would need a gas sensor. Eventually if you pump enough helium the planet could run out of helium. Oxygen would be unlimited for gameplay reasons.Oxygen Tanks would simply become Gas Tanks. To determine what they contain they would have an option to either contain oxygen or helium. Upon switching that option the other gas would be ejected if possible. Alternatively there could be unique Helium Tanks.Finally you construct a Helium Balloon.

Then fully remove the old pistons and rebuild them. Next build atleast one door block on the pistons as if part of the door. Build a merge block on that and grind enough of the old door to place a second merge block.  Be careful to insure that when the merge blocks join the door lines up properly with the door block on the pistons.

After a beta phase that is  of the time dedicated to squashing bugs. I remember the beta for ESO. It was almost unplayable. Far worse than SE has been since I started playing it. Then a few weeks later they released it officially and all the bugs were gone. The issue with bugs in SE right now is as I said ITS STILL IN ALPHA. Theyre still adding in HUGE features. Theyre in the process of COMPLETELY rewriting the network code for multiplayer. If you think bugs are bad now wait until planets and netcode come out.From now I see three major feature that this game needs before moving out of Alpha and into bugsquashing Beta Planets likely this week or next week netcode probably some time next month and compound blocks would be nice to get that before netcode but as long as we get them Im content. Those are going to be the biggest bugcreating additions this game has ever seen IMO.

This gets saved to an LCDs text.Then fly to point B and do the same.Finally you run a second script. It uses the position  direction from each reading to generate a D line. The point of closest approach for those  lines is the position of the enemy base. Print it out as a GPS coordinate to an LCD and youre done.It sounds complex but you dont have to know how the maths works  just load the script face toward the base and press buttons to run the scripts.This has actually been possible almost since programmable blocks were introduced certainly well before GPS was introduced!,spaceengineers,csy3isv,1,t5_2ygas

I am playing creative SP almost exclusively since the launch of this game and i am no where done with implementing all the ideas i have.    The key is your own creativity. You need to set your own goals like uChaemera said already.    Play a bit around with the game to get what it does and what you can do roughly. Then try to build some ships with certain functions or even just subsystems of ships like automated weldinggrinding stations a nice torpedo launcher gps torpedos a customized door made of small blocks some fancy folding shairs a new input method for ship controls etc etc etc  There are so many possibilities.    Here are just a few small tests and concepts of mine i did a while ago from which you might catch some inspiration                              Overall it is an engineering game still.

4562166,0,t1_ct5mnxi,Yeah with fast production times in mobile or web game development its a completely different thing too. Most of the time the design is simple enough to be already done or its a even a clone the art requirements are also known nearly from the beginning so coding can start late and even with rapid prototyping the bugamount is manageable enough to bugfix every once in a while. But the larger the project goes the more timeconsuming bugfixing can be. In Agile development systems where you work in Sprints every coder has a set of features to complete in a limited amount of time. Of course he has to make sure to deliver as bug free code as possible and if he is fast he can use the rest of the remaining sprint to fix as many bugs as he can manage in the short amount of time. Still there are usually more than one coder and as we all know too many cooks spoil the soup. And with larger features that take longer than one sprint its even more problematic because sometimes you cant merge your code with the main branch the rest of the team is working on for a long time so your code may depend on obsolete classes etc. All these issues are the important bugs that get fixed in the midst of development. The ones that are found in systems that are suspect to change are usually not except for game breaking bugs or crashes because there is either not enough time during one sprint or the time investment isnt worth the trouble because designers already changed the system and in two or three sprints you will refactor it anyway.Still this is currently the best way to produce games or other creative works as with Sprints you have set deadlines and enforce the divide and conquer principle where you split problems or features into smaller parts and implement each at a time. This way more complex features can get implemented in a shorter amount of time and they are usually pretty bugfree. Also the designers have the possibility to make changes on features during production because not whole features have to be scrapped but just smaller parts of them and not as much time is lost.BTW Sorry for this wall of text. I hope some people find it interesting and hopefully dont complain any more about seemingly slow or inefficient development processes in the future. From a gamers point of view it may be annoying to have to deal with bugs but I think when people actually know a bit about the work done and the processes involved they will appreciate the many working features more instead of being annoyed at the bugged few ,spaceengineers,ct5odz0,2,t5_2ygas

Yes people expect too much in too little time dont listen to anything feel they are entitled for whatever bullshit comes to their mind and wont except that good things take time and forcing developers to crunch even though they are already working in  week sprints will not result in a bug free game.For me the solution is simple education. Yes people hate getting lectured too but that shouldnt put us off. Every time I see someone complaining about lazy devs I explain how hard  week sprints are. If someone asks why they dont work in Software Development Method X That Is In No Way Compatible To Game Dev because then and only then we could have a bugfree game I explain how Agile methods work and why they are better suited for game dev as any other production method. People were saying AI must be easy to make cuz every other game has it too!! I explained that yes AI isnt that hard but GOOD AI especially in a freeform system like space engineers with no clear surfacearea for navmeshes etc are in fact one of the hardest kinds of AI to make. And I dont just say Its alpha deal with it I explain WHY there are still so many bugs after months and WHY it is unlikely they get fixed especially with major changes incoming like the new netcode etc.I am absolute positive that you cant lecture idiots but you can help the silent minority who dont know how to feel because they actually like the game but see those idiotic comments everywhere and might get biased.

4567725,0,t1_ct6dbjg,My only problem with it is the fact that other than switching to manual and trying to take those decoys out by hand which would be practically impossible especially if theyre hidden behind heavy armor while the enemy maneuvers around and while youre under constant heavy fire from his fully operational turrets you have no way of countering this tactic.Sure you could make your own large turrets on rotors and operate them simultaneously via that Multiturret workshop script which btw does not recommend using more than  but they are very expensive and waste ammo rather quickly not to mention laggy and unreliable.From an engineering perspective the decoys could just be ignored letting the turrets focus use the heat signature from the enemys engines as a target with the addition of a proper sensor I suppose or the aim improved slightly by averaging it based off the positions of the decoys aka blindly shooting at the middle but both of those would require a modification of the turret behavior and might end up disbalancing the game more.All in all its easier to just add a delay to decoy activation imo.,spaceengineers,ct6dhyf,2,t5_2ygas

Figure out what silhouette you want your ship to have while still in the design phase and allocate space accordingly.Use angled blocks to create interesting space in otherwise boring segments of the hull. You can also break up monotonous sections of the hull with different colors added modules or different block types.Play around with using angled blocks to create various types of curves and intersecting lines. Use glass to provide transparency and a sense of space.Grind down blocks to their construction form for a different look.

4685905,0,t3_3f2xud,Given the importance of reconnaissance and avoiding reconnaissance in todays world Id like a much more complex approach to this. For the radar idea similar to what you suggested Allow it to project a cone of variable width with a maximum of     Range should be inversely proportional to the square of the cones width with a very large maximum. Nazi Germany had km in the Funkmessgert Freya pre WW for comparison.   Both can be decreased without increasing the other. Total power consumption should sink in that case. Resolution and detection range should be  reduced with range but follow the same law as total range. Passive mode Radar will spot any active radar cone it is in but does not act itself.Modifier Allow to set a wavelength Larger wavelengths give a higher maximum range at same settings but reduce resolution.   Allow multiple antenna setup Multiple intersecting cones or radar blocks in the same area and with relevant orientation will increase detection range and resolution. To a point increasing the space between these pieces should increase these values as well.   Material hit could have absorbing values.Executionblocks Dish Able to throw and detect a radar cone.   Interpreter Resolves the input from the dishes into a usable form. All dishes used must either be on the same grid or connected by any type of antenna. Either Pilots Seat or a specialised seat or guiplease redesign Shows contacts and allows action with data from this contact. This could be either to point any system or the ship itself with gyros towards the contact or to use a programmable block. Weapons can be manually given targets but do not give any lead.   Programmable Blocks Can use the contacts location as a variable. This could be used to calculate an intercept course or weapons lead with a little bit of code for example.   Any premade Weapons Can fire at any contact which comes into a specified envelope but do not give lead unless operated by a Programmable Block. Remove  or massively increase  max range as the targeting would be the new deciding factor. Holotable fancy way of showing the data.technicalprobably a cpu hog... Any active dish throws a Number of rays in the specified cone with a strength value depending on its parameters base strenghconedegreewavelength or so.  These rays grow weaker the larger the wavelength the slower as they travel and disappear with a strength value of . If a ray hits something metallic it disappears but creates a number of rays in a cone facing the direction it came form with a divided strength and rate of weakening of the disappeared ray   absorbing value of the reflecting material. Cone width could for example be dependent on used material. When two rays going into the same direction within . or so hit they combine with added up strength values. When a ray hitscomes within x of a dish the strength as well as origin is reported to the interpreter. Can only report a fixed amount of strength per step any overflow is cut off. Alternatively completely shuts off or gets destroyed when overflow is reached.   Interpreter adds up all signals within a step for example half a second. All signals across all connected dishes originating from the same source have their strength value added up. The total strength value could be used to decide if that source is spotted the accuracy of the reading and the display of any additional information such as target size  tonnage.  Interpreter are able to synchronise if either on the same ship or connected through any antenna.Within the max degree limit any smaller cone should be instantaniously rotatable. When permanently reoriented towards a target a small beam should then be able to track and thus give very accurate targeting informations.If youre evil and have the spare cpu usage add ambient radiation to annoy player and make stealth easier. Minimum detection values should be raiseable manually in this case. If youre an evil player build many dishes and throw tons of radiation around to blind your opponent.Additional add a sensor on basis of the camera to make simpler ships not totally useless and to allow seeker for smaller torpedoes IR Detects a aura of any active electrical component similar to what we already have when it is damaged but only through a limited amount of blocks. Active Thrusters should have a huge aura. Typical range somewhat about m. Worsens in very bright environments. TV Detects grids at about m out even wo active components. Could be reduced for very small things. Worsens in very dark environments amount of light around the target. Worsens if there is a very bright light source other than the target in its fov.gives out the same information as the interpreter.  I feel that such a system would add a new dimension to fighting as carefully laid out sensor grids both on and off ship could give an advantage to its owner while strengthening the use of antennas.It would also promote both very long range and very close fighting as well as pre engagement maneuvering and thus would add strategic depth to any combat oriented server.  On non combat oriented uses this system could for example enhance and complicate the use of drones by giving them a powerful albeit complicated way to orient.,spaceengineers,ctl7c39,6,t5_2ygas

4954239,0,t3_3iqo1v,gtShowerthought SE is the most realistic representation of Walker combatI think this is more indicative of another problem attempting to use components built for vehicles to build walkers. Of course they suck theyre using parts not designed from the start for use in a walker! Lets face it walkers will always need special parts and components. They wont ever be as powerful as a tank in the same amount of space nor pack the same amount of firepower but they dont need to! In my own opinion a mech isnt a humanoid replacement nor is it a better tank.uEOverM said this belowgtNo more so than a tracked vehicle. In fact less since all its weight is in one spot making the ground more likely to collapse or otherwise crumble. A tank spreads out its load which is why theyre so bloody heavy  they can be.But that isnt exactly correct either. Tanks can be heavy but dont ever fool yourself into thinking its a nonissue or its something that they can afford. During WWII tanks underwent many many changes. The Germans learned that most bridges couldnt support their armor! Often German armor wouldnt be able to follow the mechanized infantry but instead had to find their own paths around things and even ford streams! The lighter ones could but they werent half as heavily armored nor had decent armaments.A mech fits into this because again its not supposed to be built like a tank. Its more like mechanized infantry support. Its armored but not like a tank. It cannot stand up to a tank shell nor can it penetrate tank armor easily. We already have a vehicle that can go head to head with pretty much any other tank in the world and mechs just couldnt handle that shit. The M Abrams can. You may ask well hows this allow a mech to avoid other hazards like unstable land? Well have you ever seen a model of a human skeleton walking? We use our entire skeleton! Like a human a mechs best ability isnt being better able to traverse uneven or unstable terrain but its able to correct any errors it may encounter. Lets face it if a tank starts to slide down a muddy embankment theres not much you can do to stop it. Well actually there is nothing you can do to stop it. But with proper electronic equipment a mech will be able to keep itself from overbalancing and therefore it can respond to the terrain dangers and shifts much quicker than a tank but less so than a human. Armament is another issue. uLoneGhostOne wants to punch a tank. I commend him on being awesome but thats probably not going to happen anytime soon most likely. I imagine armament similar to Battlefield s mechs with either antiinfantry weapons like miniguns andor recoilless projectile weaponry rockets will be used to avoid throwing the mech off balance. An entire upper torso really wouldnt add much to the fight with todays technology.  Its not like youd mount a main tank armament onto the mech again its not a tank and to think of it as one doesnt provide the correct image.At least thats my  cents. What do you guys think? ,spaceengineers,cuj0sq3,15,t5_2ygas

5062339,0,t3_3ka4uh,Turning off connectors as OP saw works. The problem seems to be that the magnetic force applied by the connectors when they turn yellow does not take the mass of the ship into consideration and accelerates the mobile connector toward the stationary one with a fixed force. If the ship is on the heavy side the mass multiplied by the acceleration is enough to make them explode.  Dampeners dont help because your thrusters ARE taking the mass of the ship into consideration and cant counteract the disproportionate magnetic force of the connectors. IMHO the magnetic force of the connectors needs to go. ,spaceengineers,cuw7bv6,4,t5_2ygas

Look at the poll results! The poll is not a representative sample! You say? Only people who care about weapons will be on this thread! You say? Or for a real quote from you  There are a few weapon mods from lasers to capital ship kinetic guns but they dont seem to be all that popular.  I believe that I can demonstrate that this last statement is incorrect.Go to the workshop. Sort for block and sort for most popularall time.  I just did that and I found that  of the  top rated mods either included modded weapons or were entirely a weapons mod themselves. If you sort by most subscribed  of the top  downloaded block mods are weapons mods or include modded weapons... and now we are at better than  of the most downloaded mods being weapon mods or including weapons. Your point that there are more mods for not weapons than weapons is absolutely correct but surely you can see that if  or more of the most popular mods are gun related then a number of people really do care about... guns.You really think all those people  including me  should just leave?

Because considering Keens track record that would be the fucking dumbest thing they can do. Theyve given us weekly updates since launch and rarely are there any critical bugs like this. In fact this one is the worst since I bought it over a year ago and probably the worst since launch. Firing employees over a single critical error is not only incredibly ignorant but illegal in most places due to labor laws dictating procedures on firing employees.gtthe other has resorted to petulance and personal attacks.I called you an entitled child because you are acting like one. Its like demanding a store clerk gets fired because they ran out of your favorite cereal. Dont get mad when people call you out on your bullshit.

5254057,0,t1_cvjafz2,I hear what you are saying but I really disagree. Unless there is some sort of massive grinding and rewelding time modifier I am pretty sure that grinding a single block down collecting the components and then mounting and welding it somewhere else is always easier than cutting whole chunks out of ships and manipulating them.  Especially in a war zone or meteor storm! In your suggestion someone could literally steal an external component by just grinding it down and jetting home. If your way was implemented I believe people would always just grind and rebuild because it would be faster easier and they would have more control over placement.Definitely scared to get into a realism debate but think you are wrong here as well. While what you say regarding taking things apart and putting them back together might apply to many situations surely you can imagine items so complex or advanced that a single engineer could not simply take it apart and put it back together again reliably? Clarke famously said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Thats the kind of thing I am talking about.However I definitely want to acknowledge that your way would work in game and it also has the added benefit of creating a meaningful economy. I just think you are wrong if you think people will voluntarily create frankenstein ships via merge blocks because it is quicker and easier than grinding.,spaceengineers,cvjavvx,1,t5_2ygas

5348721,0,t3_3o9veo,When you have pistons on the ship anything attached to them changes the center of gravity of the total structure.  This is turn causes thrust to apply accordingly.  Normally thrust just pushes you in whatever direction the thruster is set to without regard for center of gravity but the piston attached sections cause the thrusters to have to fight against the weight of trying to move a separate grid.  Kind of like how things get very wonky if you go too fast while towing something using landing gear.For an easy real world example imagine you have a cardboard box and you push it only form the top of the rear panel.  on the ground this wont do anything but move the box forward in midairzerog this would cause the box to tumble.  This is effectively what is happening to your ship.  The only counter to this while keeping the piston attached parts is to position thrusters to account  the differences in center of gravity.EDIT And uDeathray gave a different work around for this that I didnt see.

5502356,0,t3_3qgikk,I didnt see people call them ion thrusters for a rather long time until you mentioned it. Well maybe i should spend more time in the steam forums and alike?    Within the forum they have been more agreements that they would be Q thrusters over ion thrusters well over a year ago already.  Since then only a few people ever named them as any specific thruster type and instead they got refered to as thrusters due to the absence of any other type of thrusters.    Furthermore in recent discussions these thrusters got rather called electric thrusters over anything else as that describes their function and nature best. They were plain thrusters giving constant thrust per watt purely driven on electricity and nothing else.    I dont remember if any of the ksh devs called them ion thrusters in the stream and by their current state they sure arent. Though if they intend to change certain aspects of it they would become such an ion thruster.    Overall though the thrusters we got are insanely powerful compared to real thrusters out there right now. They are about  to  times more powerful if i recall correctly based on their OLD thrust values prebuff even. So any real life comparison is flawed anyway due to SE still being a game and thus sacrificing certain aspects for the sake of fun Which of course doesnt mean that we should throw realism all overboard as i generally like it that way in SE.,spaceengineers,cwez75x,1,t5_2ygas

You are leaving details out that supposedly rule this card out for you at whatever time you tested it and then claiming it rules it out for everyone forever. I can claim some totally anecdotal facts too. I run Shadow of Mordor maxed at a slight DSR ratio and it stays perfectly stable at about the .GB threshold.You are also stating that VRAM has and will continue to be the sole limiting factor for performance in a AAA game which is preposterous. Not only does VRAM usage vary widely between games of similar fidelity and based on hardware configurationssoftware settings it is on the verge of being one amongst many potentially hugely optimized facets of hardware utilization thanks to the lowlevel nature of recent advances in graphics APIs like DX and Vulkan.There is absolutely no reason that a  wouldnt serve someone perfectly well for gaming in the coming years.EDIT You are also comparing apples to oranges. I ran an AMD card for a few years and am well aware of its strengths and weaknesses. AMD tend to have lower clock rates and parallelize a lot more. The wider buswidth does accommodate the frame buffer for nonstandard resolutions well but is not simply a direct upgrade. They also have terrible driver support. I guess it was in their interest to push towards a lowend graphics API because they couldnt really compete or keep up with NVIDIA in updating their driver for newer games. Hopefully future games will benefit on both platforms because of it. ,spaceengineers,cwza7yu,0,t5_2ygas

5774055,0,t1_cxcsi9b,I believe they simplified the collision behaviour to reduce CPU overhead. Instead of treating the collision as inelastic smashing one layer of blocks creating a small explosion then allowing the sim to tick until the next layer of blocks collides Allowing a very heavy ship to crumple in a collisionWhat they instead did was to calculate the collision as a single elastic collision with the total kinetic energy of the collision being treated as a single scaled explosion at the point of impact.For a small capital ship with mmultiple contact points like my ship here that can be pretty devestating.

5937115,0,t1_cxxgrzt,Well the obvious addition would be hunger but Im hesitant to suggest that because its so easy to do poorly.  Empyrion has a hunger bar and I feel like Im doing nothing but eating constantly because it runs out so fast.  Also Space Engineers already requires you to monitor your health oxygen level hydrogen level and suit energy so adding yet another factor seems needlessly complex.A different approach might be to treat food as a buff or extended periods without food as a debuff but its not really clear what that would do  your health level rarely matters since when you die its going to be because someone dropped a spaceship on you or something.  You could imagine other effects but I dont find the whole hunger thing all that interesting honestly.As for machinery I think its important to keep every feature in perspective and only add dedicated machinery for mechanics that are sufficiently important to gameplay.  The oxygen farm turning into a hydroponics bay seems reasonable and a dedicated rock crusher is consistent with an arc furnace but I probably wouldnt go so far as to make say a sawmill because wood blocks are just decorative so early players would likely just bypass that to avoid the inconvenience.That said theres an argument to be made for lots of really specific machines Terrariastyle so that you have an excuse to build a huge sprawling base or station with all sorts of different rooms and corridors.

But thats entirely subjective considering the terms Alpha and Beta are so misused by newer companies the real definition isnt exactly set in stone note the set in stone rules are broken by Minecrafts development path anyway. Eventually towards the gradual slowing of updates and completeness of the game well see competent NPCs and NPC structures Massive Optimization both in processing speeds and gameplay straightforward player progression as opposed to open sandbox although this will always remain optional player customization beyond cosmetic items instead beards eyes and skin tones? higher integration with steam in a similar fashion to how Unturned has recently included cosmetic items and above all It will likely have far more popularity than it does now.I like to remain fairly optimistic about Keen as they seem to be some pretty hardworking and selfless individuals working on a game that they clearly pride themselves in.

6206887,0,t3_40loz3,I cant watch the gifwebm but i am pretty sure to know what happens the stations tears the ship apart.    The reason for that is that collisions are calculated based on mass.  However stations got an infinite mass as they are immobile.  Thus their resistance against collisions is incredibly high and judging by a few tests i did today even outright buggy right now so that colliding grids sometimes even just vanish instead of desintegrating block per block over time.    I always found the decision that collisions are based on the grids total mass a bit silly. Instead blocks should be no more or less resistance than another same block just because they belong to a bigger or smaller grid or even to a static grid over a dynamic grid.  I hope they rethink their decision in that regards.    My guess is that their reasons for that was to make the feet of large ships more resistant to their weight or impact as they grow bigger.,spaceengineers,cyv5ndf,7,t5_2ygas

6774075,0,t1_d0fzvfq,Generally a  ratio is good. At nominal lift capacity for one large thruster  metric tons you burn  of a tank of hydrogen on the ascent to orbit. This leaves  for you to use on landing. Because SE has capped speed you only need a fraction of this to stop.  All that remains translates to flight time.If you feel like cutting it close you can get as low as three tanks for five thrusters but thats going to leave you very very small margins for landing and return to orbit. Youll likely be finishing the insertion on ions.,spaceengineers,d0k4hi2,1,t5_2ygas
6776088,0,t1_d0kbpur,What I actually do is use the booster to loft an ion drill ship up there run to the moon and back and then dock to the booster again for landing.

I can pull a full haul of my Rhino which is  tons real weight or  tons ore weight on x inv. down to my base safely with it.But yes that is a good snippet of advice if you dont plan on overengineering your setup like I do played way too much KSP can you tell?.,spaceengineers,d0kcq25,1,t5_2ygas

6943190,0,t3_4arvgp,Ive been working on modular station pieces that are no larger than xx  blocks high  blocks wide  blocks long. The reason for that size is so that I can use a x welder bed pointing upward attached to  piston that retracts downward since  piston has an extension range of  blocks.I try to keep the pieces under KG so I can use a small utility ship to lock with landing gears to the top of each module and fly it over to the stations location for that module to merge onto.Each module has  merge blockconveyor tube input port and  merge blockconveyor tubeoutput ports. This way each module whether its a solar powerbattery module a production module a communications module a medicaloxygen module or a small ship landingdocking module can be merge on to other modules in any fashion while preserving the conveyor system.I made a script that calculates the component cost or the ore cost of a projection and outputs to LCD block on the same grid so that you know exactly how many materials you need before you start welding the module.I havent thought about publishing the modules or updating the script for others to use but if theres a demand out there I might.,spaceengineers,d13c9dv,2,t5_2ygas

For example if you are just hovering without any movement in a gravity gradient your power consumption and thrust output will often be lower than you would expect to require for performing that task.  I dont know why that is.I suspect that running a timer block or anything which continually updates the state of the grid would probably have an effect on this orientation delay.

However getting out the first time was very difficult. Dropping the friction while increasing power and adjusting the suspension allowed the rover to climb back out.After a run or two of hand mining or mining with a drilling rover like above an airship miner that offloads to a rover transport is much faster.,spaceengineers,d202evr,2,t5_2ygas

7734990,0,t1_d3lekht,You can but you would also have to edit your PirateAntenna.sbc so it includes that antenna name as well as adding ships that spawn on that antenna. Its possible to make a whole piratehostiles mod to have your own custom shipsbases that spawn your own custom drones at whatever rate you want. Even a way to make these ships spawn randomly in space if you want. Theres even an indepth guide for how to do that floating around. Ground bases have to be pasted in manually though since they dont spawn randomly.I think theoretically you could have pirate drones spawning off of any block you want so long as its in the file or maybe not I dunno. Im actually kind of surprised I dont see much workshop PvE content since it requires so little coding. Im actually thinking of making some myself. Nevermind!

8107710,0,t3_4q2equ,Ive hosted a server for a few months now playing with  other folks. Overall performance is OK but there are a number of sync issues around rotors pistons merge blocks and landing gear. These are at least the main bugs that get us into trouble.For merge blocks every time they are first built and merged youll need to log out and log back in to fix the sync issue.For landing gear if the gear is locked on something and you either break the landing gear or the block its attached to youll need to restart the server to resolve the ensuing sync issues. This is my biggest complaint since I use landing gear to hold pirate ships while they are being salvaged.For pistons and rotors simply avoid using them on any moving object its completely broken and will at some point result in your ship just shaking into oblivion. But they do work on stations.Otherwise I havent had too many issues with sim speeds and regular game play.,spaceengineers,d4rdnzf,1,t5_2ygas

8212386,0,t1_d540yiq,gt I personally like planets they make the game uniquecoughcoughEmpyrioncough  I feel like the game development has become stuck because the engine really needs serious work that will take months but the weekly updates commitment forces them to spend time doing minor fixes so theyve got at least something to put in them.  All the time people are crying that theres no new stuff and wheres the AI and etc. etc. as though you can just keep throwing stuff on the pile and not have it collapse on you.  Sometimes you just have to rip out an old system because its running up against its own limitations and you cant do that in a week.  The idea that you can just optimize everything later because its in alpha is wrong because now theyve built on top of those unoptimized things and everything above it might need to be redesigned if they try to make it work faster.  Its the only game that has ever made my BIOS do an emergency poweroff because the CPU got too hot theres no question that the engine needs attention right now.There are other games where you build spacecraft out of blocks and fly on voxel planets very similar games that run much better at the cost of currently simpler game mechanics.

8464409,0,t3_4vhzsf,Along the way Ive done several things. Using right click to run drills manually will destroy stone and ore instead of collecting them.. Rig connector network through sorter that whitelists stone and leads to either a connector large shipstation or ejector small ship set to throw out the stone. This is slower but automated.. Warhead mining for bulk stone removal. Use a handdrill right click or small ship to get the depth of the deposit and rig up the blasting rig accordingly. This is primarily for stone blasting not for ore retrieval so Id avoid this unless you really need your ore NAO.. Asteroid Muncher. Figure out how big your mining ship is and make it bigger. You know  big enough that you can eat the entire asteroid and simply store the stone for later. Whitelist the stone into a containernetwork connected to ship via merge blocks and connectors. When done jettison the containers and their stone and leave them there as a depot in orbit. Youll probably never come back and the space pirates may blow up the stone stockpile... but do you care?,spaceengineers,d5zl6bm,1,t5_2ygas

9191340,0,t3_56595p,Well the game already calculates ship mass and obviously volume for the purposes of pressurization so calculating the average density of a spaceship would be an easy task.So when the spaceship or just ship in this case sinks below the water level exert a buoyancy force opposite the direction of the natural gravity. The lifting point should be in the center of mass of the displaced water volume. If the ship is partially submerged count the blocks that are underwater and modify the force by a factor of submerged blockstotal blocks which is also relatively simple.The final step would be to add drag. Something similar to the aerodynamics mod but affects only submerged blocks.I dont think this game needs another complex fluid dynamics problem for our already laggy clients to calculate so keep it as simple as possible or dont do it at all.,spaceengineers,d8h2ipj,1,t5_2ygas

9631273,0,t1_d9yzojg,My thoughts on speed The main thing is that there needs to be distinction between large ships small ships and jetpacks. When everything has the same static speed limit everything from combat to exploration just becomes more flat. It doesnt need to be huge for reference I came here from Kerbal Space Program. I think large ships should stay at the current cap of ms. Jetpacks can be bumped up to somewhere in the range of ms so you can more effectively move around the exterior of a moving ship for repairs and whatnot. Small ships should be somewhere from ms to give them an edge in combat and exploration.,spaceengineers,da093d5,1,t5_2ygas

By the time you hit the missiles will have just impacted the enemy is probably scrambling to muster a counterresponse and youre immediately ready to get the dropships to bring in ground superiority. Id also load up the FOB with rocket PMTs like its Fourth of July and maybe even something to get decoys airborne. Since youre so close m distance small ship bombers will have a hard time coming up to max speed so they may be rendered inoperable before even getting a first volley out. Since youre sitting on the ground you can armor up your top in case one does get through.

This mode will really force you to do things quite a bit differently. Wolves actually become a bit scary when you cant fly or use rd person  you always need to be on the lookout.

10616543,0,t3_5rxgsb,So the license thing seems interesting but but the whole license system as described here feels rather convoluted. How would you go about getting your first ship if you need a core played Empyrion have we? XD and license blocks to activate it which require credits to purchase? IAnd the scaling on licenses to make the core passively eat your credits on top of it means owning any ship can get quite expensive in a hurry depending on exactly how its scaled. While Im not opposed to this idea taxes are real it needs to be done very carefully so as to avoid making things prohibitively expensive or legitimately impossible brokeno hope due to tax for lessthanhardcore players. There must never be a situation where it becomes impossible to play. cant make money because no working ship cant get ship working because no moneyI think licenses should be less of a physical component and more or a credential like real licenses are. A system where you might have to pay X to be able to operate ship with Y mass. Perhaps even speed limits for various types of vesselsmasses.Violations result in an automatic distress signal going out effectively giving your position away should be a fairly significant incentive to not go overspeed for your license or try to move a ship thats way above your cannon pay grade if you have a license for a kg or less ship and you hop in a million kg freighter youre gonnna set off the distress signalalarmOther than those thoughts this looks like it could be a ton of fun and Id definately be down to get in on this meet some new people and have a good time.,spaceengineers,ddb0l94,2,t5_2ygas

10884471,0,t3_5vhpx1,I cant say that I disagree. Ive kept a singleplayer survival world saved for a while. It was still in its early days and I decided recently to return to it. From looking at recent changes it sounded like the focus on bug fixing had yielded borderline playable MP with a somewhat more stable experience. I was thinking of turning my world into a multiplayer server so I had all kinds of grand ideas about designing my own PMWs and other cool things.As a starting point I decided to implement my own automated solar array alignment script. I had a reasonable idea for how to align multiple arrays at once while keeping script run time to a minimum but it required the ability to set rotor upper and lower limits i.e. get all of the solar arrays into the same position then treat them as a single array. My first attempt left a hole in the roof of my base. It turns out setting rotor limits from a script causes them to spin out of control and blow up. Somehow setting it from the player interface still works. In other words not only did they break a simple property setter but it looks like they broke the player interface to match the broken property setter behavior. Ive seen engineering like this before...my day job is to fix product bugs in software. This is not a good sign. Its bad enough that its hard to find reasonable API documentation. I dont want to be troubleshooting bad API behavior to find the random incantation that somehow makes things work. If a patches break property setters for basic scripting functionality Im starting to rethink my return to SE. I started looking into the situation with PMWs and find that not only were they intentionally broken by welder changes but may actually be considered an exploit by developers this isnt entirely clear but its what it sounded like from looking at the forums. API instability makes me reconsider any thoughts of moddingscripting and now that Im looking at it more closely basic block functionality still seems to regularly get broken as well. You can tell a lot about how a system is organized by looking at howwhere bugs turn up. When you see a lot of random new bugs pop up all over the place with no real pattern its generally a sign that either there are many developers working all over the product on random things or the system itself is designed in such a way that minor changes affect random and difficulttopredict parts of the product. If its the former then were not really in beta yet. If its the latter this game may never make it to beta. I havent given up on SE just yet but Im only working on a static ship. At this point Im not treating this as an engineering game. Im treating it as a block building game. However I doubt this will hold my attention for long. As with minecraft and other block building games Ill build my castlespaceshipltinsert random coollooking thinggt grow tired of the fact that most of what Im during is purely aesthetic work and leave.,spaceengineers,de2nm8k,4,t5_2ygas

With four of the saddle bags for thrusters its even capable of operating on moons with  thousand KGs of cargo. Replacing the reactor with two batteries and a solar panel also gives it a very long lifespan when out and about. In addition it can also be modified to fit an oxygen generator instead of a tank which is also useful for a moon. I dont know if it could work as a colony starter ship of sorts but Id like for you to give it a bit of a try and see how it works out as one.That being said I really like the design.

Things like different ways to dispose of stone have come up a lot and its usually some form of drainthisatthisplace type design. But as Ive mentioned elsewhere in these comments I generally have extremely light battery ships on planets. My main issue isnt really disposing of stone its just a part of the game with a million solutions. My main issue comes from how normally I end up getting far far more stone than uranium. Which means I either practically waste a mining trip and handle it in a good way at my base or I have an extremely slow pour of stone that hinders my extremely light designs in other ways.I really appreciate the engineering and thought that goes into peoples work.

Moving linearly possibly wont be an issue but once you rotateturn it may be an issue.,spaceengineers,dfrwlgb,1,t5_2ygas
11439447,0,t3_637t3y,Im missing something what happens when you surround an empty reactor with batteries?Making a small station with only a couple solar panels and battery and a running refinery I can immediately show that the behavior of batteries and solar panels is erratic at best right now but that by reloading I can get them to function as I expect if I dont interact with them beyond a certain number of interactions or certain sequence of turning them on or off or selecting various charge options. Doing much will break them very quickly and stop either all the panels or the battery from supplying or receiving any power whatsoever even taking into account how finicky power management is to begin with.Ideally if your solar panels combined output exceeds your ships power requirements AND you set the battery to recharge the battery will simply recharge. As I said this if statement has far too many random results that are not this situation but I was able to make it behave as I just described for a limited time by reloading.I was seeing all sorts of odd behavior. Clicking a battery to recharge showed that it was still supplying power. That hasnt worked like that before to my knowledge. The main thing about solar panels is that if they cant supply all of the ships power needs  they will either supply none of it or if there is a battery set to recharge they will ideally  then provide all power to the battery. YMMV.,spaceengineers,dfsnfkh,1,t5_2ygas

11459687,0,t3_63kmm5,yea sadly ssds can help only a little since its not only loading from the disk but creating the world which takes its time.as usgcam said if you give us specs we can try to identify the bottlenech but itll still take a long time to load even on hardcore highend rigsp.s. if you dont know the exact specs press winR and type dxdiag there for some info,spaceengineers,dfuy503,3,t5_2ygas

11539675,0,t3_64p0ht,Also dont go for details at first. Build overall shapestructure and the start adding little details here and there.And browse Workshop. Actually mess with others designs have those Ah! Thats how he did it! and reuse some solutions.,spaceengineers,dg40vsk,5,t5_2ygas

11581486,0,t1_dg8fdrg,Im not expert on scripting but I think the answer to that question is No.Right not the only way to active the clearing mode as you called it is to manually activate it. Youd think by they would have added the option to toggle it on and off.,spaceengineers,dg8ro0b,2,t5_2ygas
