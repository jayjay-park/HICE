8996284,0,t3_522lsi,My friend and i built something quite like this some weeks ago and we have found Asylum visitor to be a great addition. Its a lot easier on the lifeloss than bob and it synergizes great with lili and nahirinot to mention opposing lillis. Were running  now but can even see going to  since it can also take the role of beatstick and theyre not as toxic in multipled as bob is.,MarduMTG,d7t7pmk,1,t5_3by0k
9644209,0,t1_da1u2y9,I started running Sorin maindeck because the only games I would win were with Lingering Souls. The Nahiri build couldnt protect Nahiri enough to get an Emrakul on board and in my creature version you were playing one threat a turn and just eating removal. You never put enough pressure on grid unless you got like  Boros Reckoners on board super fast but by then their gameplan had churned out a combo and reality smashers or some bullshit.Mardu just lacked something and I was tired after endless months or trying to make it work. So I didnt built Grixis Control I built Delver for a more fair deck and it works just fine.Im a quitter ,MarduMTG,da1uja0,1,t5_3by0k
