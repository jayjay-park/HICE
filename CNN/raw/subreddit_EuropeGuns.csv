This would be for humane dispatch of deer livestock and other large animals so really only applies to vets deer stalkers livestock farmers etc.,EuropeGuns,cfk1gjf,1,t5_2za0g
1398632,0,t3_2a38ag,Totally legal in Sweden assuming you have a licence for a gun in the caliber you want to load for. You need a special permit if you want to sell or give the ammo away though.Powder has a kg limit for storing at home but otherwise you can have any amount of bullets casings etc.I think its fairly popular here and its not hard to find components in online stores.,EuropeGuns,cirlkyz,2,t5_2za0g

2198364,0,t1_clj9i5n,Thanks. Wont it be more expensive? I found another range which charges  euros and bus from NL to Prague can be had at  euros each way. Im not going to spend  euros even if they have SG on hand. ,EuropeGuns,clj9llp,1,t5_2za0g
