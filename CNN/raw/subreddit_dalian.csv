A minority of people would be able to speak Dalianese a completly different language comprised of some japanese and russian words sort of like how shanghainese and wuhanese are different from putonghua which a normal mandarin speaker could not understand. Again the language barrier only exists with the older generation of people in Dalian. Also to add onto that comment below i have some friends studying at Dalian Technology university and they say its very good and prestigious as well. There are also some other universities you could look into like neurosoft or some in a development zone in dalian called Lushun.,dalian,crm9l5r,1,t5_2thrb
