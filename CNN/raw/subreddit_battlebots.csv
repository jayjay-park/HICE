Maybe itll give some more momentum to ComBots or whoever else is still going in the next year or two.Im going to bet its going to follow something like the  season with just one weight class featured. They will definitely be trying to air the most destructive fights to try to get some of the mainstream appeal.

4462271,0,t3_3c7zdo,. No six foot tall humanoid robots fighting is not practical. If you want to see that go watch the drama that came out of Robot Combat League and have fun watching a crappier version of Real Steel.. To my knowledge competitors only get money they can get themselves or they get from sponsors. Plus entering a sponsored bot at least in robot combat competitions I have been to cost more money but that usually evens itself out.. There is a list of banned weapons usually things that a normal person cannot get i.e. no explosives or firearms or things that are extremely cheap and game changing such as nets glares at complete control. On top of this there is a weight limit of lbs. Most of these rules are for either A safety purposes or B so the competition is more even for people who may not have the time and money to create hulking machines of pure impracticality see ... No DARPA does not have to be here. If they want to make a robot that complies with the rules then they can make a team and compete. The stuff they make is to save lives on the battlefield not to win a contest against a couple of kids from college or a hobbyist.. Lets see youre RC car go against Tombstone or Warhead. Hell Id like to see it go  Mph like what happened to Warrior Clans Mini bot.. Drivers yes get to practice. On their own. Without an enemy bot. Imagine playing paintball. You are usually scared to make a move because you dont know what the other team has. So instead you try to find the best way to attack the opponent. That takes time and a lot of baiting on the field. Finding out your opponent cant turn very fast or has an open slot they couldnt patch up can easily turn a fight. It only takes time and a lot of waiting to figure out where and when the best time to strike is. If you know you have the advantage such as the case with tombstone you might go in full force and tear apart the other persons armor. If you are like witch doctor and think you have the advantage you go in full force and make the mistake of going in when the opponent was able to get around you and send flying through the box. These drivers are fighting timidly because something they have put sweat tears and maybe blood into this bot only to be destroyed because they dont know what the opponent might have in stock for them.. Some of the obstacles may not be working I think someone else had already said the killsaws were not functioning. The pulverizer are working though so people have been using those. They can see the battlebox and what is inside it but not many of the hazards are really helpful to use. The ringside blades for example do nothing but move a bot slightly if they have something that can be moved into there.I give it a  only because there is a bit too much filler compared to the older seasons.Edit I fixed some of the wording so it read more smoothly.Edit  Without and enemy bot gt Without an enemy bot.

4507795,0,t1_csyu7xg,Early season battlebots did have sections of the floor that would raise into ramps not sure why they did away with it I cant imagine it was too difficult to implement. Better than the Spinners IMO which are gone in this box regardlessLATE EDIT I think an issue with the flooring would be twofold A in changing it out B in each bot cowering in its corner waiting for the other to come to it. If you have a walker and youre fighting a bot with low ground clearance are you going to go over to the flat metal section? No youll stay in the lumpy section where it will get stuck. If youre the other bot would you chance to move over to the lumpy section to attack? Its suicide. Would lead to boring matches.If there was some way to have the ground change on the fly it might work but having it worked out in a way that its controlled by the bots Robot wars pit opened by the big tire button ie and not just random combined with the difficulty of having the terrain transform make it an unrealistic aspiration.,battlebots,csyuviq,2,t5_2ts52

4650675,0,t3_3emrse,Bronco. As long as Tombstone doesnt get a knockout or crippling blow with one hit I think Bronco will take the match. The first impact will toss the bots around the arena but Bronco is  fast and well driven enough to get over to Tombstone before Tombstone can respin and turn to face Bronco. Remember the Tombstones blade makes slow to turn. Once Bronco gets under or behind Tombstone the match becomes a game of bounce the bot around the box until it selfdestructs or leaves the ring. If I had to guess Id say theres a  chance Bronco wins as described above a  chance Tombstone cripples Bronco with the first hit a  chance both bots suffer enough damage to give Ghost Raptor the final and a  chance the battlebox is irreparably damaged causing no finals or rumbles. ,battlebots,ctgs2bu,5,t5_2ts52

5145689,0,t1_cv63inn,I believe it was actually  bonus. So a  pound walker was allowed to weigh  pounds. The shuffler bonus that was enacted became the  bonus so a  pound shuffler is  pounds.Very true though SoW was the reason they changed the weight bonus. Its shuffling mechanism was more efficient than previous designs by a HUGE margin and was not as large a drawback as previous walking robots locomotion. So it used the weight bonus to create a massive spinning weapon. I know in the SPARC ruleset you now have  different weight limits per class. The basic wheeled one the smaller shuffler bonus and the larger true walker bonus. In order to qualify for the true walker bonus the main proponent is that continuous rotation of a motor can not create continuous motion of the robot. Shufflers all do that. A true walker requires the motor to reverse direction I believe. Of course its always up to the discretion of the event organizers.,battlebots,cv68yf7,8,t5_2ts52

My expectations arent that high but Im excited to see what kinds of survivalist innovations the builders who chose to go this route have implemented and to see these techniques evolve in future seasons just as the main bots have.Im more interested in what kinds of weaponry teams add to them. Most conventional combat weapons are out on the basis of mass disparity. Flamethrowers are the obvious choice but of limited effective potential. Ive heard some creative ideas though cant wait to see some of them come to fruition.

Some other pitfalls are if you want to build a certain type of bot and your just getting started dont be afraid to do your version of the design dont get caught in the classic intellectual trap of wow that works well for them Ill do something different. Another trap to fall into is not iterating all the best bots out there have been developed over years there are some ways to bootstrap your way up but in general its going to take time stick with it. Another pitfall to get trapped in is especially for big bots some purposed weapon will seem really dangerous to humans or wood or whatever but you opponent is going to be just as well armored or better armored than your bot keep that in mind.

That being said some of the bots get so demolished that arena cleanup time is often over budgeted for this reason.Weapons that squirt liquid are forbidden by the design rules. Doesnt matter if its water soluble or not its unilaterally banned. Theres not a fundimental difference between a weapon that exists to squirt a liquid or one that encases a liquid in a thin shell and then shoots that shell at the opponent causing liquid to splash everywhere in the immediate vicinity.The rules explicitly ban fouling devices  which includes ball bearings and glue. Essentially if serves no other function than to be a dick andor make a mess its forbidden.Theres a real and notable difference between cleanup because a damaging weapon has done damage and because a dick has fired paintballs all over the Lexan and arena.,battlebots,d3qq6af,1,t5_2ts52

8194123,0,t1_d51skmx,Those in question were DOI vs chomp tento vs poison arrow and sawblaze vs razorback. Last year aggression was aggression. This year it must be aggression with a primary weapon in order to count. IMO we need a middle ground. Agression with a secondary active weapon should count but I dont think that Agression with a wedge should. The debate on the sub has been not only about the rule change but most of us are dissapointed that the rule change was not made clear prior to the matches either to the builders or the audience. The  fights in particular that have been discussed have been cases where the primary weapon was damaged or disabled but the bot still managed to control the match either through a secondary  activeweapon  smotherer lifter or in sawblazes case their dustpan wedge. IMO Sawblaze deserved to lose. Their saw was still partially functional so they should have tried to use it. All they did was use their wedge after one attempt with the saw. However I do sympathize as they were not aware of the rule change at the time of the match. DOI should have won. They arguably used their lifter to cause damage and flipped chomp a lot and controlled the match. But since it wasnt a primary weapon the judges went in for chomp.I havent seen the full tento v arrow fight  so I cant judge yet. But it sounds like tento controlled the fight with the smotherer after the drum broke but failed to do anything with it as Arrow racked up damage.

The outer cylinder is really thin aluminum which seems to just hold the pulleys and transmit torque all the weight and energy is in the discs.Also according to Will the drivetrain died due to the batteries failing possibly due to inadequate cushioning.,battlebots,d65ukfs,15,t5_2ts52

8633761,0,t3_4y4314,What in the hell are you making that disc out of? To my knowledge no spinner has a spinning bit close to that weight with good reason its a waste especially on a disc spinner. The issue with heavy disc spinners is that if you spread weight out it messes with the power behind your disc. You want as much weight at the edges of the disc as possible because that means as much kinetic energy will be at the edge as possible. Frankly with a disc spinner you dont need to have a really heavy spinner and if you spin it at the legal limit  mph you dont want it to be heavy since it might just tear itself apart. With the exact design of the disc you are describing it would be even worse because it would be horribly unbalanced and you would fuck with your disc in ways you dont want. So dont make it with such a heavy disc use the saved weight on something more worthwhile like a more sturdy frame. The only bot with a carbon fiber frame is hypershock the only reason hes survived with that is because his frame isnt exposed and in the fights where it has been gotten to its been fucked to hell. When you have a bot with a similar construction to nightmare that fucking to hell will happen much quicker and much easier. Second dont use the unbalanced design of a disc you described it will fuck you to hell before your opponent gets the chance. ,battlebots,d6ktsn0,1,t5_2ts52

But some of the contenders werent ready in time so the chancers and joke bots for later episodes were subbed in.

A horizontal spinner will rip them to pieces and I wouldnt be surprised if your own hits buckle them out of shape and risk making your drum hit the floor.The others are pneumatic tires. Even filled with foam theyll just be too damn floppy.A fullbody drum will put a gigantic downward force on itself whenever it hits anything and a big soft tire like that will deform elastically so much that your drum hits the floor. This will proceed to launch your robot backwards across the entire arena.What you want for a fullbody drum is a wheel with a small tread height compared to its diameter either a Gabrielstyle wheel or a solid rubber tread and a durableashell rim.Another think you want is very sturdy axles and a sturdy wheelaxle attachment because theyll be overhung live shafts subjected to a gigantic load.,battlebots,dcnic8b,3,t5_2ts52

11361515,0,t3_62502n,The only problem I can see is that for each movement you need more motors and more gears. Which adds weight and complexity to the bot meaning less weight for armour and drive which will help with step  P.for the spinnergrabber to be effective you want to be able to pin your opponent without using a powered grabber. There is a featherweight bot in Aus that does this effectively by using two wedge pontoons below a drop saw. the wedges lift the opponent up and the drop saw can then get to work.

11620490,0,t3_65rw2q,Hey thats how I got my start. After watching OG season I merged my old lego kits with the Lego Mindstorms set I got in  so it had some level of remote control and commandable autonomous function. Then I built unbuilt rebuild and refined quite a few combat robot shaped objects. Only after the cancellation of OG season  did I muster up the balls to try materials I found at the hardware store and craft stores and glue them to the parts of old RC cars.,battlebots,dgd6z10,6,t5_2ts52

11763949,0,t3_67tpoa,Heres an idea that I had watching last season. Take a couple D kits. Add on some steel turtle shells to them. Domes or pyramids whatever you like best. Spring load them so that the shell hovers just above the floor. When the  pound bot rides on top the shell drops and high centers the other bot. Have a small cylinder with a couple shot tank so after a couple seconds you can pop the other bot off you so youre not an entanglement device. ,battlebots,dgth1ij,3,t5_2ts52
