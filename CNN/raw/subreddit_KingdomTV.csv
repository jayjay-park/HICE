Back in  when Legend of the Seeker was cancelled fans donated hundreds of DVDs to libraries got bus ads etc. to ramp up the interest. When Hannibal and Agent Carter were ending there were petitions and social media campaigns. It.. ultimately didnt work for these shows but in all of those cases the TPTB at least acknowledged the possibility of the move and that there was interest from other networks. Plus nowadays you have streaming services like Amazon Prime Netflix and Hulu that might want quality content with some back catalog so I hope thats an option for Byron to consider. ,KingdomTV,dfqujpz,1,t5_348u6
