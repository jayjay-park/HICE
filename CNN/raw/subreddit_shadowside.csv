405317,0,t1_cfmhsqk,June is very rich in character. Shes a female but she has such masculine qualities. And just when you think the androgyny is unreadable some times shes feminine and other times shes very butch. Her sexuality is indecipherable her wants and needs vague. Even she doesnt seem to know. So many layers like an union. Shes very headstrong and tough but deep down theres something that makes her flee from town to town from job to job.Shes not a simple answer. Shes so unreadable a ball of confusing contradictions. Strong while weak left while right up while down. You cant pigeon hole her or easily identify her. Shes human. Her pain and heart are very real.Shes everything I imagined myself growing up though I never got a nice pair of tits ,shadowside,cfmrzrw,3,t5_2t8zh
