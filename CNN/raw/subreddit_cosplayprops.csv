1650019,0,t1_cjn1tg1,Thanks. Metal files are amazing compared to sandpaper. They dont jam up and you can reuse them. Very good for flat sections of props.,cosplayprops,cjn5coi,1,t5_2ymty

5337368,0,t1_cvtvvcg,Thank you very informative.gt  The consistency is just slightly thicker than heavywhipping creamThis is what I needed too.  I know that there are some manualpowered ie you blow in a tube airbrushes but its hard to find em.  But good to know the streaking isnt bad.  Especially for when trying to make metallic surfaces.,cosplayprops,cvtwp2j,1,t5_2ymty
5857961,0,t3_3v7a12,I am an very avid Star Wars cosplayer and prop maker.  One question is do you want to try to get into one of the charity groups like Mandalorian Mercs st or Rebel Legion?  The reason i ask is because it will depend on what materials you can use for approved costumes if not then its completely up to you.  I agree with the others that EVA is a pretty good material to start on.  You can see some of the stuff I have done here and Im always helping people and answering questions.  I love seeing what people can do and helping them make the best things they can.  ,cosplayprops,cxni9x3,1,t5_2ymty
6531812,0,t3_450847,These are really great! You could totally sell these! They are pretty much perfect! It would be cool if you could add like magnets inside them on like the back so you can have a belt with metal on it or washers or something sewn in it so you can have them attached to your belt like they do in the series sometimes.,cosplayprops,czuxw4t,1,t5_2ymty

7576923,0,t1_d33cz2n,Here is a quick GIF I can make a longer one or still images with more detail. The gun has two states sniper mode where the barrel sticks out of the gun quite a bit and a scope pops out there are some other things but those are the main ones and a rifle mode where the scope gets gown the barrel gets shrter and two thingies separate a little bit from the gun. What i was thinking was kind of a mechanism like those in short umbrellas where you push a button and they extend not the actual umbrella opening not the thing which stops rain but the actual stick which gets longer kind of like a saber laser for the barrel. So that to go riflegtsniper you press a button and then the barrel extends and in its way pops the scope out and does its thing for the rest of the pieces. And to go snipergtrifle you push the barrel inside the gun like an umbrella I think that this is the best thing to do because moving in such a long barrel with an inner mechanism would be very diifficult so I think is better to push it manually and in its way inout it will activate the mechanism for the rest of the pieces.,cosplayprops,d33gk5b,2,t5_2ymty
7623311,0,t1_d38o7bm,Its not the propellant its the solvent that eats the foam. The solvent is what makes the paint liquid. Once that evaporates the paint is dry.,cosplayprops,d38qadr,1,t5_2ymty
7737925,0,t1_d3ll75t,Youre right it is actually a helmet. Indeed I use a base helmet. Than I cut mm foam into interesting scifi shapes and glue it to the base helmet. Works surprisingly well.,cosplayprops,d3lquwj,3,t5_2ymty
8069762,0,t1_d4m7zq1,ahh ok! thank you ,cosplayprops,d4n48ry,1,t5_2ymty
8340605,0,t1_d5k2zkq,Cant treat it the same as WED. Kidneys and rakes are still great for it but it wont be as effective as working in wed. Have a heat gun handy as he clay gets pretty hard without heat. Dont be afraid to hit it with sandpaper if you need to. It will also hang on to details very very well. ,cosplayprops,d5k4oht,2,t5_2ymty
8661052,0,t3_4ygsiq,It depends on the foam you get. You can get closedcell L foam which is pretty floppy but the LowesHome DepotHarbor Freight puzzle mats or the super nice  mm foam rolls from TNT Cosplay Supply are a lot more rigid.Plastidip does add a little more rigidity but is still flexible. If you want a truly hard helmet youll have to coat it in Bondo or fiberglass. Honestly though Plastidip is more than enough as long as the base foam is fairly sturdy!,cosplayprops,d6o8yki,2,t5_2ymty
8667903,0,t3_4yjdc4,I bought a similar pair of black boots on Amazon for  a few years back. Uncomfortable as hell but thankfully these are usually only used a few days a year. ,cosplayprops,d6p3wfy,2,t5_2ymty
