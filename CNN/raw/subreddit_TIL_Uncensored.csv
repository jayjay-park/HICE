11740215,0,t1_dgpfwhw,There are crazies put there obviously I just take issue with people acting like those people are everywhere... Because they arent. Im not saying that youre saying that though necessarily. Im just saying in general. Ive hitchhiked over a thousand miles personally and have never had anyone that wants to do me harm pick me up. And Im a little five foot five hundred fifteen pound white guy. The most dangerous part of hitchhiking is by far simply being in a metal death trap going mph around other people who are also in metal death traps... Driving is far more dangerous than hitchhiking. ,TIL_Uncensored,dgqs7gw,1,t5_3k39d
