6572615,0,t3_45aqb4,Depends all on the playstyle. Let me post a little that I said about zeal items from another post.gt Honestly it comes down to preference now.gt Static is best for pure burst damage and has good waveclear. The best for trading in lane.gt RFC still has decent damage and the extra range. Its the dominant choice for a poke heavy Caitlyn.gt Runaans is the most consistent in terms of damage and the best for team fighting. This is still my go to rush on Caitlyn but thats just me.gt PD provides the least amount of damage with the most raw stats. Great item for vs if you like that on Caitlyn.gt All of the items are looking like decent options one way or another so its best to choose the one that suits you best.Even though RFC was nerfed its still a good item regardless and the range is great. Static for sure has the superior damage though. ,Caitlynmains,czz5vgc,1,t5_37w8x

7785886,0,t3_4ly736,Hi Im a Plat  Caitlyn main and started learning her a lil bit last season before the ADC meta came along. I started learning ADC last season by being a  trick Jinx. I started learning Cait because good assassins were just wrecking my Jinx due to little escape ability. For me I know when to pick which ADC between those two since it is a question about being able to survive a dive or assassination but if I had a larger champ pool such as Ezreal Lucian Trist Vayne when do you pick Cait over these ADCs?  I know Lucian is heavily favored in the meta since he can abuse the YoumuusBC build so why should I continue playing Cait when I can go for someone OP like Lucian? I usually ban Lucian because Im not good with him but he is the only ADC to give me difficulty to lane against.  I sometimes play Trist and Ezreal and I do well on Trist consistently but I have a hard time deciding whether Trist or Caitlyn would be better picks for certain matchups for team fighting. In lane I generally can do fine with whichever ADC but I mention these specific ADCs because they have selfpeel and some type of mobility.  I usually pick Cait because it is a comfort pick but dont know if I am overlooking anything when it comes to champ selection. For instance since Zed and Fizz ult cannot be cleansed by QSS it is a bit harder to play against these assassins what is your general solution? For AP grabbing Maw and staying far is simple but against AD assassins I am a bit loss. I usually consider steraks but lately everybody has been recommending GA for ZedTalon which seems fine but I havent had enough games to test it completely.   What do you think about ADCs current impact on the game? Since we just came from Tank meta to Mage meta do you think ADCs are playing a much smaller role majority of the game? I feel like I have a much less impact on the game this season but then again I wonder if it is because I am playing at a higher ELO this season while last season I was a Gold  hypercarry Jinx so I could easily make an impact on my games because the skill level was lower and the champ was built for the slower longer paced game.,Caitlynmains,d3r6tz0,1,t5_37w8x
8694144,0,t1_d6s8xh0,You literally search Hannah Of Piltover Caitlyn guide. And its either the first or second link.And if that doesnt work you search Caitlyn builds and look on either Mobafire or Lolking dont remember what one she used.,Caitlynmains,d6sec4i,2,t5_37w8x
8772036,0,t1_d725vgj,But what if you are getting chased? They just walk over it because it hasnt trigger it ,Caitlynmains,d7265g5,2,t5_37w8x
9009943,0,t1_d7uqyi9,This. Get competent at support so you know what the other guy in your lane is doingthinking. I play one to four supp matches a week just to make sure.,Caitlynmains,d7uurvh,2,t5_37w8x
9461925,0,t1_d9f4g1f,RFC...? Do you mean Runaans?,Caitlynmains,d9fd6hb,2,t5_37w8x
9625300,0,t3_5c3eu8,Its good to poke with ur passive and spam traps everywhere. I personally max traps and i keep one ready so if he ever jumps on me wgt qgt egt aa gt aa. Hopefully i get my passive off twice in a row. And get full q dmg if he steps on a trap. A good supp to have vs a luc imo is leona naut zyra. If ur supp can soak dmg from lucs ult and hard cc him then u should win a lot of fights. ,Caitlynmains,d9zilym,2,t5_37w8x
9680608,0,t1_da5rmvr,Yea i realised after looking back that the enemies were pretty retarded xD,Caitlynmains,da6c7md,2,t5_37w8x
9739737,0,t1_daa9de0,What time is considered mid game? Cause Im usually sitting on Greaves Dblade Infinity edge and my runaans.Despite this I feel kinda weak taking towers although I tend to tear the enemy as a new one almost every time.At this point I usually try group and fight should I group here or is it better to just hold and push waves till Im sitting on   . items?,Caitlynmains,dadmvs0,1,t5_37w8x

10051973,0,t3_5join6,Ive found the same thing. To be honest Ive completely stopped playing Cait since the preseason started. Without fervor shes way less fun.,Caitlynmains,dbhsq06,1,t5_37w8x
10064274,0,t3_5jmc4f,Haha good work. I know the feels. I vd as cait vs mf thresh and my wife just was like so?,Caitlynmains,dbjecvj,2,t5_37w8x
11192069,0,t3_5z6zos,Something related to this topic though not relating to builds if you dont mind my asking is what is the correct combination of abilities to Headshot multiple times in quick succession? What things should I be watching for and in what order do I QWER? ,Caitlynmains,df0lw7c,1,t5_37w8x
11741923,0,t1_dgqyj6o,Yeah. Attack move is good when you have  target but in a teamfight its usually better to pick targets precisely.,Caitlynmains,dgqz6es,1,t5_37w8x
