89071,0,t1_ceocx47,Glad you had a good time sorry it was probably lonely!Fossils and gyroids are for you to dig up.  Anyone can.  Take them with you I can only have fossils appraised when the gates are closed and I have enough to do at those times  making snowmen trying to get my villagers to suggest PWPs CMON POLICE STATION.  I think I might make a new character and get in good with the villagers and then wish for a police station.  Theyd have to suggest it then right??The town is open for everyone to use to dig stuff up harvest buy sell bring Katie catalog.  The only hard and fast rule is not to take items from the cataloging area south of the river.  Otherwise its first come first served.,SharedACTown,ceokikb,1,t5_2yrs6

222057,0,t1_cf3qg1v,gt The rules for Ennuia are North of the river is the free zone. Items can be left swapped and taken from here. There is no real take one leave one... just leave stuff if you want or take stuff. There are a lot of perfect apple trees here the apples are free for anyone to take as many as they want.gt gt The SOUTH part of town south of the river is for cataloging ONLY. NOTHING is to be taken from this part of town. There are some rarer sets here to be cataloged. Not all are reorderable. We have to be able to trust people to catalog these items and not take them for themselves. A LOT of work goes into organizing and maintaining these sets for everyone to benefit from. Hybrids are grown here in the south as well and taken to the north part of town when there are enough to share with others. The only exception are fruit trees you may take any fruit from the fruit trees anywhere in town.gt gt If you are agreeable to following these rules Ill be adding you tomorrow. Please respond! ,SharedACTown,cf3qkf6,1,t5_2yrs6
