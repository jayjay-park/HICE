594800,0,t3_20y46x,Depends where you are paddling. Shallow rivers? Lots of bumps. Lake travel? Less bumps. If you take good care of your boat it will last a long long time. If you bump up your paddle it is easy to refinish it. ,canoeing,cg7vsef,1,t5_2t797

1334343,0,t3_29cgv8,There is a product called restorethat restores faded plastic. IIrc it isnt very eco friendly so if you are just looking at doing this for vanity reasons you might want to skip it it is an oil that never really dries. I dont ever recall seeing ramx made out of anything other than single layer poly so any deep scratches will need to be tempered to be fixed. Tempering poly takes a lot of practice to be good at but the steps are easy to follow essentially use a heat gun to heat and soften the boat then a torch to melt new poly in the scratches. It is so tricky because the soften window is so narrow before you melt the boat. Good luck. ,canoeing,cijqa8o,1,t5_2t797
1491113,0,t1_cj2yw7q,Im not sure where youre getting your information but aluminum does not rust. rust iron oxide is FeO. You wont be getting that from aluminum. Rusting is not the same as aluminum oxidation and it definitely does not lead to the same end result.This is why aluminum canoes over  years old  are still around even if they were mistreated. If they were truly rusting  forget about it.,canoeing,cj36pbe,4,t5_2t797

2660946,0,t3_2qg4p4,To be honest the . foot difference in length isnt going to make a huge difference in weight but it will add stability for when you are out paddling Assuming you meant . ft. I have worked in the past teaching kids how to canoe and the stability factor is really important. Kids will swing and flail while figuring out how to paddle and can easily tip the canoe especially if its a windy day. Maybe consider portage wheels for moving the canoe. They can be expensive but with a little research you can make them yourself. ,canoeing,cn5ww5q,2,t5_2t797

I want whatever will last the longest.  Aluminum fiberglass wood I suppose they all have their strengths and weaknesses not really sure which type would be the best for our purposes.,canoeing,co15y4k,2,t5_2t797

7398559,0,t3_4gnypw,Dont worry I didnt drive it home on that car just wanted to see if it would fit it doesnt... Or at least I would need a strong roof rack.Ive been canoeing on and off for many years this one is quite heavy but its huge wide and has a center keel should be very stable. Im not too worried about portaging its only for paddling on the lake outside my place.It needs a bit of TLC minor stuff but I got a good deal on it. And I cant wait to get it out on the water.,canoeing,d2j617z,1,t5_2t797

8549588,0,t1_d69nm9a,This might be the ticket for me... I think if I can distribute the weight better across more of the cross ribs I might feel more comfortable cinching it down with a ratchet strap. Im wondering if I could notch out some wood to sit on the carts frame so theyd come off with the canoe and then I could still fold the cart. Hm. ,canoeing,d6a9r1l,1,t5_2t797
