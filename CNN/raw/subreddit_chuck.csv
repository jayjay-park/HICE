Through out the entire series I am rooting for him to blossom emotionally into this badass with feelings. I have been trying to read and find as much information as I could. Read that they were almost cancelled multiple times  which explains why a few parts of the show felt like it would have ended perfectly there. Thank god it wasnt cancelled earlier.

1188880,0,t3_27q7w3,I am in the same boat as you Watched the show when it first came out but somehow forgot about until it was on netflix and then I binged like crazy sometimes watching  episodes in  day No seriously. I like a lot of people was dissatisfied with not so much the ending but the loss of such a great character. I know they had to finish the show with a bang but I wish they hadnt of messed things up between Chuck and Sarah and then left us with an ending that was Up for us to decide. Im on my second rewatch but cannot for the life of me rewatch season  where Chuck couldnt defend himself or do anything close to season . Like you said the whole ending it on the beach thing was a great way to bring the show full circle but I didnt like the last  episodes with preburbank Sarah she almost looks like a completely different person when you see her watching the report tapes that Casey gives her. Of course I cried a little you would have to either have no heart or be Adam Baldwin to not cry at the end of such an under appreciated series. I hope that in the future we get a Chuck movie I dont care if its a flop  or if no one likes it a chance to see these characters on my T.V. again would be a blessing.,chuck,ci3d932,10,t5_2r4nd

Ill stick with Chuck.And then I somehow forgot about Chuck and never watched it until the bottle episode with the bomber in Castle in Season . I then downloaded the entire series and was heartbroken to find out it had ended shortly after I finished Season . Made Season  hard to get through.,chuck,cisp93d,2,t5_2r4nd

1724711,0,t1_cjwjxmu,Im not talking about everyone at the Buy More. Im talking about mostly Chuck and the people that know shes a spy and her real name. There are a lot more confusing plot holes in the show. I think they could have got away with going into more detail about her past with Chuck. I get that she always switched names but she told Chuck pretty much NOTHING about her past before she was Sarah yet she tells Shaw like a day after they meet lolIt just seems pretty selfish on her part when she has someone who actually wants to know things about her past and cares about her and she just tells some guy she just met like a month before over someone she knew for years and someone she was willing to run away with. I really dont get that logic.,chuck,cjwkbo8,0,t5_2r4nd
1901216,0,t3_2frs7d,Man. the hole in my soul after I finished watching the finale was so huge I did an immediate rewatch. Sarahs mission log and her reaction to it nearly killed me. Strahovskis acting in that scene was spot on and I misted up a bit which is rare for me  I simply cant cry dont know why. When Chuck makes the decision to put the intersect glasses on on the rooftop knowing that he wont be able to get Sarahs memories back is still painful to watch after I have seen it  or six times now. the Jeffster performance is just as epic as their performance and accompanying battle in sep Chuck vs The Ring pt. .  I think that the ending was as good as they could make it considering the choices the writers made in Chuck vs The Bullet Train. I only found Chuck this past February and have watched the entire series  times and seen my favorite episodes at least  or  times. For the past year the show has been a significant light in a dark period in my life. A special thank you goes out to Schwartz Fedak and the cast and crew for helping me get through a rough patch in my life and in general for creating a tv show with so much action comedy and heart.,chuck,ckiaa6x,7,t5_2r4nd

Amazon is notoriously bad for being one of the absolute worst of the big American tech companies when it comes to international support.Netflix is the same with its content.
