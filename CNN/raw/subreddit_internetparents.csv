I recommend that you keep being a great friend shell really appreciate it. My other advice would be that if you do her tell you how you feel and she doesnt reciprocate keep being a great friend. Obviously I dont know your personalities or anything but it sucks to get out of a long term relationship and then also have your support system disappear. I hope that everything works out but also keep in mind that if you never leave the friendzone there is nothing wrong with just staying best friends!,internetparents,cjooq2c,1,t5_31jj6

1868075,0,t3_2fywkm,If your first thought is to look at someone and tell them you find them sexually attractive and you follow through with that impulse thats creepy. For example it is appropriate to tell someone they look nice today.  Its not appropriate to tell someone they look nice today by saying Daaaaaamn total stranger of gendergenders that you are attracted to you are fine as hell.  Lemme get yo number. If you actively and persistently pursue someone who is not interested in you thats creepy.For example if you ask someone for their number at a party and they dont seem interested and dont want to share it is appropriate to be like Bummer. Fair enough. and go about your business.  It is inappropriate and creepy to get extremely angry and call them mean names because you feel entitled to have their number.If you ever find yourself saying Maaaaan people of the gendergenders you are attracted to always date douchebags.  Im such a nice guy. youre being a creep.  You get the idea.It really is all about respect for boundaries and social awareness.

2331607,0,t3_2m0pin,The days of getting interest from a bank on a checkingsavings account are over so the selection criteria should be convenience customer service and customer rewards. There may be an outstanding bank in your area but they have few branches that are convenient to you. If there is one great. Customer service  Credit unions have a smaller customer base and they get to know their customers. Customer rewards  Generally you can get lower interest credit cards and specials on auto loans etc. The flip side of this is that they usually require more money down.The biggest issue with credit unions is that they sometimes mostly require membership. Only certain employees are offered automatic membership. Like anyone who works at XYZ or ABC corporation are eligible to join. Youll have to check the ones in your area to see if your job is eligible or if  you qualify to join by virtue of your parents school or other criteria.

At a school environment you can talk to your instructors if youre having trouble you can talk to advisors if youre having trouble you can talk to the dean of the department if you so choose and you can still succeed. If you believe that you have people on your side then you can succeed in school. Of course there is nothing wrong with working retail either.

3417526,0,t3_2zb4xk,I do think its an anxiety issue and Ive totally been where you are. Youre asked the most lowkey question that demands a choice and you are just stuck. It makes you feel stupid and very anxious and is a miserable thing. So heres how to work on it a little bit. Take a moment every once in a while when youre calm and ask yourself questions without a time limit. Imagine slowing all your thought processes down and just going with how you feel at the moment. Start with thinking about going somewhere for breakfast. Is today a bagel day or a croissant day or a pastry day? Envision how it will go when youre in the situation at the counter and just remember that you definitely can find your preferences. You do have them. Its just being able to think clearly enough when you feel pressured by time or circumstance. In terms of your dad asking what you might like from the store if he isnt leaving right that second ask for maybe ten minutes to think about it and write up a list. If hes leaving immediately its okay to say I cant think of anything right now. Because ya know you cant. When you live on your own youll actually have more control over this stuff. You can sit down and make up a list  youll have time to think and look through your cupboards and fridge to see what you do and dont have. No one will be expecting any answers immediately so you can make it a very laid back process. Given at the start of the post that you mention having an easier time if given options give yourself options. Keep those options in your mind all the time. Like at the store do you need dinner stuff breakfast stuff snack stuff or other stuff? If its one of those its easier to make a quick decision rather than think of each specific thing. This was a bit rambly but I hope it helps.,internetparents,cphtmcg,6,t5_31jj6

There may be positions close to those on the list that could also work if you think about it a bit.  If you sort them by how much you can see yourself doing them then work your way down the list looking for actual openings in each field that would be one way to start tackling the job hunt.  How much money you earn is going to vary depending on which field you end up in but you can Google the pay ranges and even starting pay ranges for many fields and get decent results.There are college grads with zero experience getting jobs in this market...the job market has been steadily improving since  and is now right about where it was before the recession.

I think its difficult not to fall pretty hard for the first person you are physically intimate with and it sounds like it meant more to you than it did to her. edited to add This seems to me more like infatuation than love but the two feel awfully similar especially when theyre not reciprocated. Im not saying that she didnt like you but when you look at societal norms kissing and hugging is more in the I like you and think youre cool territory than in the Im in love with you territory. Its perfectly okay to not have a lot of experience with physical intimacy but you do have to be careful when you confuse it with emotional connections. The two arent always in lockstep for everyone.     Youll get over this but itll take some time. In the mean time please try to learn how to validate yourself and figure out how to make yourself happy so that when you meet the person you really want to fall in love with you dont have to worry about them making you happy. That way youll be able to focus on making the relationship work at a nice natural pace. ,internetparents,cr1uz6i,4,t5_31jj6

4373425,0,t3_3afqcm,Hey Slnk I would say that marijuana affects different people differently and that the effects can change over time for a person.  People develop a tolerance if they smoke regularly or daily for one thing.  There really are daily smokers who go to work and who have good jobs and a normal life.  But that is also a person with a major THC tolerance in all probability.  Some of your friends who smoke now will end up giving it up or cutting down their use.  Others might realize that they have a psychological addiction or an addiction for short.  A great subreddit for discussion of some downsides would be rleaves.  There are some people who love pot too much but who cant control their use and so they use every day sometimes all day every day.  Thats what an addiction looks like right?  Of course some most? many? pot smokers are fine and dont develop a problem.  These are the kind who can cut down or take time off and are those who dont take crazy risks or make unusually large sacrifices so they can smoke.  I would factor this into your thinking.  And of course waiting until youre in your twenties at least before you think about smoking pot would be good advice too.  ,internetparents,csimck3,2,t5_31jj6

This part sucks but its necessary.  Using a stiffbristled brush is ideal if you have one on hand. Periodically drain the water refill and repeat the previous two steps.  Do this until the stains are no longer visible then do at least one more time just to be sure. Washdry like you normally would for clothes e.g. a washing machine  a dryer or clothesline only when youve already done all of the above and ensured theres no visible stain left dont want to bake those stains in now do you?.  You might want to give it an extra prewash first before the normal washdry routine.You definitely want to use some kind of hard disinfectant.

People are recommending bear but it tends to be something of an acquired taste. I know I didnt really start liking beer for several years after I started drinking.You can go with beer if you like there is no shame with Mikes hard lemonade or those hard root beers that are a thing now.If you are going to do liquor then get mini bottles. Its rough if you taste something and hate it and still have ml to drink.If youre doing liquor also buy at least one shot glass a mixer or a chaser soda works well for either purpose.Ok now have a friend over. Youll want it to be someone who you trust. Eat a big meal before starting and drink lots of water or Gatorade during your meal and all day the day before.You should be full but not stuffed. After dinner start drinking slowly. For each unit of alcohol one beer or one shot or one glass of wine you should follow it up with  oz of water or Gatorade.Go very slowly. Alcohol can take up to  minutes to get into your system so DONT PUSH IT. Also know that your liver filters about  unit of alcohol per hour. You may think you can get a no and then maintain it by drinking one unit per hour and you can but this will build up alcohol byproducts and will increase how sick you feel.Ok so now youre a few drinks in. Do something fun dont just sit around. A board game video games movies exploring your sexuality with your friend JUST KIDDINGare all good things to do. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE BECAUSE YOU ARE BORED.Snacks are a good thing to keep on hand as well.If you drink too much dont panic. Stop drinking. If the room feels like it is spinning stay upright and fix your eyes on something stationary. Put your hand on the wall or something strong and stationary this will help with the spins.If you or your friend passed out make sure you both know the recovery position. Google it. Im in mobile or Id link it.If you feel like youre going to puke you can choose to fight it or not. If you fight it itll last a lot longer and you may puke anyway. If you just go puke youll feel much better sooner but you mentioned youre afraid of pukingin right there with you so the choice is yours.You should plan for everyone who is drinking to stay the night there.You should also have some medication ready to treat a hang over. If youve followed my advice you probably wont get a hang over but its good to be prepared.Good luck!,internetparents,cx9clb8,6,t5_31jj6

As long as youre not planning a suicide youre likely fine. Yeah its scary and it can suck a lot but in Georgia at least its usually free. Theyre also discreet. It was actually kind of obnoxious  trying to contact my gf at the time was a huge pain  so dont worry about it getting out.I went to two hospitals and even though I hated it because I was being whiny and uncooperative mostly I saw a lot of people get serious help for their issues. Many told me it was great just getting away from the pressure imposed by family friends etc. The food was good I got time with a doctor for the first time and the other residents were really nice and supportive. Just bring something to kill time and its a half decent vacation.But dont wait. Reach out now to anyone who will listen. Get in contact with a doctor. The tip about the suicide hot line is good use that resource. I thought I was fine one day and I was bleeding out on my mothers carpet the next. Ask now. Today if you can.

Im still learning how to regulate my emotions and probably will be for the rest of my life but Ive learned in the past few months that it seems like healthy people will try to cheer themself up when feeling upset before doing anything else.Some examples Take note on when you last ate  cause hangry is super easy to fix.Stand in direct sunlight and take a few calming deep breaths vitamin D deficiency can also cause irritablity.Find funny memes.Look up jokes.Ask a friend for meme updates.Find cute animal videos.Make a cup of tea andor read.Watch a comedian or comedy.Roll around on the ground.Make funny faces.Sing along to your favorite songs studies have actually proven this will lower cortisol a stress hormone in your blood.Get some fresh air and walk around the block.And if its more than just a fleeting emotion over something trivial and you still feel upset after that start digging deeper to find out why youre upset and reach out to friends if youre still having trouble?I think the best advice I can give is to pay attention to how happy people react to stress and try to identify which aspect of emotional regulation your parents skipped. For me it was the buffering period between feeling anger and reacting. I was never taught to question my fristration. I was that it was totally okay to blow your lid at those you love over something trivial and irrelevant to them like misplacing a reciept. It can be tricky learning how to navigate your emotions even when you had healthy examples growing up but it does get easier with time and practice. The bigging is always the hardest after that it only gets easier.I hope this helps best wishes and good luck!,internetparents,dcce4ai,1,t5_31jj6

You get so you can feel like this is a thing thats happening to my body but it doesnt have to effect your thinking that much.I noticed that I always seemed to think of the right thing to say not just after I walked away but after I had calmed down.  So I started training myself to remain calm when stuff happened.  I remember stubbing my toe and making sure that the first thing I thought to do was laugh rather than curse.  Similar stuff for other situations  just shortcircuit unproductive responses.  Getting flustered is almost never the right response anyways.

10726733,0,t1_ddkx8if,Thank you for the kind words its very hard sometimes to look at the evidence and still reject it. Even for something like when it snows. Doesnt matter that Im a  hour drive away because Im not there to help I feel like a failure. My mom actually jokes that maybe she and my dad should have a couple more sons so then at least theyd have some help around the house. Even if it is playful like she says it is its still stings because I know what she really wants is for either my brother or me preferably me since Im the oldest of is to move back to town or close to it so we can help with yard work the snow and home projects that she and my dad cant do anymore. I dont think scars are any easier but I do appreciate the solidarity and support. I think it sucks when parents get physical with kids. Maybe because I grew up in the sickness but its a lot harder for me to understand why in the word anyone would want to be physically abusive to a child than why a parent would be resentful and spiteful like mine.

Please dont let this continue.  Its one of my biggest regrets I didnt just leave when I was younger. Something that was the hardest thing for me to come to terms to was that my parents werent those nice caring people that took me to the store or gave me toys.

10989552,0,t3_5wxm6t,Its kind of a pain one that we all go through. Your primary care doctor is just that...the person you go to first for medical care everything that isnt an emergency. If your current concern is something they cannot treat they will refer you to a specialist who can.Typically a primary care physician will be under the internal medicine specialty. Sometimes you might find a doctor under family medicine or general. Just about every other category of physician is a specialist that requires a referral from a primary care physician.As you have discovered your insurers findadoctor feature is probably pretty useless. Their directory probably isnt up to date and many of the doctors listed are not accepting new patients anyway.If there is a hospital system in your area that you liketrustis convenient they probably have a customer service department that can help find a doctor for you. Call them. Let the agent know that you seek a primary care physician need an appointment for an exam and what area of town you would prefer your doctor to practice.Alternatively you use your insurers or the hospital systems findadoctor directory to call around. The first question to ask is Is the doctor accepting new patients?. Next verify that they accept your insurance and preferably are in network. Then with both of those conditions affirmed schedule an appointment. It seems that you have an active health problem. So I would advise accepting the first available appointment. Otherwise it may take weeks to get you in.Good luck.,internetparents,dedmq28,5,t5_31jj6

11243545,0,t1_dewenk9,Late to this but wanted to add my quick thoughts. Absolutely spot on about the total reward bit. Ive only had to negotiate salary once current job. I thought Id accounted for everything comparable. The interviewers asked what my expectations were for salary as theyd advertised it as competitive.I was upfront and said x is the figure Im on in my current job. But I earn a small amount of commission so my take home last year was actually y. This job would be better for me but Im not looking to take a cut.When I was offered the job they took my y figure and rounded it up to the nearest . But after the interview I was kicking myself as I realised Id not factored in  fewer days of annual leave per year and several hundred pounds of incentivebonuses that came in the form of shopping vouchers so werent on my payslip. I thanked them for the offer but said Id neglected to factor that stuff in. I said Id have to think about the offer theyd given but if they were willing to bump it up by another  then Id accept there and then. They did.I didnt want to talk myself out of the better job by pushing too far from the original figure Id said. But that x figure was too conservative. Not by much but I lowballed where I should have highballed.With everything  money leave benefits scheduled hours I cant echo uSoldierOnce enough in that its about being clear about your needs. The interview is one time theyll definitely hear not only what you need but the motivations behind it so if you want something you think might be a struggle think beforehand about how youd best be able to pitch it.,internetparents,df6ftnd,3,t5_31jj6

Its just...theres localityspecific stuff that you might have to deal with where you are that Im not aware of.I peeked at  to get an idea of what rental ads look like and if you havent already look through those yourself to get an idea of what rent looks like on average.  Renting a room in an apartment will be cheaper than trying to rent solo. . It looks like youll need to at least save up rent and bond we call bond security deposit in the US before moving in.Then consider the moving expensescan you borrow a friends truck or do you need to rent one?  Or rent movers?  Factor that in.Since you dont have a car look at public transport options and calculate a month of getting to workschool. Youll need to cover that. Even if you mostly walkbike budget in something for bad weather daysstorming or whatever.Most listings on craigslist mention electric gas and internet so if you dig into listings you might find one that gives a breakdown right in the ad. Dont forget your phone bill too.Or you can even email several of the listings and just ask them what utilities run. Its an honest question even if youre not looking to move immediately so theyll likely respond with a ballpark.

11442846,0,t1_dfswe4s,Cool.  Also consider getting a rice cookersteamer combo device. I say this because its easier than using a stove and can be used to make rice with some fish if you like fish and can get it cheaply and veggies without the same timecommitment as cooking. You basically throw water rice veggies fish into the pot set the timer for white rice and when the rice is done so is everything else.  Just add some sort of condiment or spices for taste.  And if you ever move to a place that doesnt have a proper stove you can take this with you.So anyway with foods...below is a braindump scattershot of some stuff Ive learned.  Its in no particular ordersorry.To keep things really cheap the bulk of your calories will probably be a carbohydrate of some type. Some people eat pasta which is wheatbased unless you look for glutenfree which is ricebased...in my area theyre priced about the same so if you like rice noodles better than wheat you can buy them without it hitting your budget much some people mainly eat rice.  Rice is easier to make consistently with a rice cooker.  It can burn on the stove if youre inattentive. In my area I can get frozen hashbrown potatoes for pretty cheap and I personally like those better than pasta or ricebut unlike pasta or rice they take up freezer space which might be at a premium in a shared apartment. You can also get big bags of whole potatoes for cheap at least in my area. for lbs which are good for nuking in the microwave for a fast baked potato. I used to load those up with a lot of butter salt salsa and cheese. If youre in CA corn or flour tortillas will probably be pretty cheap as a staple if you like Mexicanstyle foods.  Mexican food generally is pretty cheap to make because in the US at least all the foods its based on are local and nonexotic. Except avocados but in CA youll be able to get those for much cheaper than I can.Oh and ramen noodles make a good cheap base for a meal tooyou can throw veggies or eggs or whatever in with them to make them more nutritious. Better than eating them plain. I sometimes put chicken livers in them. Dont live on plan ramenalways supplement with meat eggs and veggies otherwise youre courting malnutrition.Eggs are a really cheap source of protein.  In my area if I go to the most competitive stores I can get  dozen for ...  I basically live on eggs and theyre very nutritious.  I also like to buy chicken livers because theyre cheap and easy to cook and are protein but a lot of people arent fond of liver. If you have ethnic grocery stores around those will often have cheaper produce fruit and meat than the big chain stores.  But the produce might look less perfect than youre used too...small or with small imperfections. Still good to eat just not as shiny sometimes.Chicken is the cheapest meat in my area but you should check local prices to see whats the cheapest in your area the price per pound since it varies over the US.  Like I know in the meatproducing states stuff like beef or pork is a bit cheaper than where I am. Im not sure whatll be best in California but in Chicago the best bangforyourbuck is chicken thighs.  As a culture for some reason everyone eats chicken breasts these days but chicken thighs and drumsticks are really tasty because they have a lot of fat and chicken flavor. Dont be afraid of fat in meatsits the thing that makes the meat moist and flavorful. Leaner meats you basically have to replace the fat thats not there to make it taste good.Since meat can be expensive if people arent eating eggs or want to supplement beans provide protein.  Be sure to read the instructions carefully if theyre dry beanssome type of beans red kidney beans are TOXIC if not prepared correctly from a dry state and basically require you to soak them overnight and change the water a few times to leech the toxins out before you cook them. Canned beans dont need this theyre already prepared.With veggiesfigure out what veggies you like.  I like onions cheap bell peppers sweet when fried in a pan tomatoes broccoli and most asian stir fry mixesyou should buy whatever types of veggies you know youll actually eat. If you have freezer spaceyou might not yours might be limitedyou can get frozen otherwise youll have to periodically get fresh. Canned is more expensive than fresh in most cases but itll also keep longer.  If you have an Aldi in your area they are VERY good for canned stuffmuch cheaper than anyone else.  For fresh youll have to learn through experience how many fresh veggies you canwill actually eat before they go bad. Onions keep for months in a dark cool area. Other stuff goes bad more quickly.Youll need some sort of cooking oil to fry stuff in from time to time.  I like real butter but its pricier. Margarine is the cheapest stuff but it tastes funny.I would highly suggest getting a multivitamin or a Vitamin C supplement and to actually take it regularly or semiregularly. A lot of college students on really shoestring budgets are susceptible to getting scurvy because they end up eating a monotonous diet that doesnt have enough Vitamin C.  Nowdays we dont have scurvy pirates but we do have survy students.  Arrr!  Even if you plan to eat a diverse diet with plenty of veggies or fruits its good to have a multivitamin squirreled away in case something happens to your budget.  Store vitamins in a place where they wont get hot or wet. Vitamin C will break down in heat so if you leave a vitamin C bottle in a hot car trunk or on a hot windowsill its going to screw around with the levels of vitamin C and you wont necessarily get as much vitamin as it says on the bottle because the vitamin will have broken down under the heat. Source I used to label beverages in the food industry and talked to food scientists about the decay of Vitamin C in energy drinks over time and when pasteurizing drinks.Hope that helps and that someone else will come by and give better advice for your specific area.  California isnt exactly obscure! ,internetparents,dft1b7n,3,t5_31jj6

11552705,0,t3_64vkcf,First step take a deep breath. Asking someone out is hardly an Olympic sport.Second step take a good long look at yourself. Are you happy with you? How do you look smell and appear overall? First impressions are paramount. If a female you walked up to you on the street would you date yourself? Are you interesting? Do you have interesting hobbies? Are those hobbies things that other people specifically girls would be interested in? Can you talk about a variety of topics and be interested in things other than your hobbies? These are questions you should ask yourself before you begin to pursue someone. If you can check all of those off. Great! Now step three. Relax girls are people just like everyone else. There isnt some sort of magical special thing you need to do to talk with them. If youre uncomfortable being around women try looking for things about them that interest you and talk with them about those things. Do you see a girl with a tshirt for a band you like? Great! Try starting and holding a conversation with her about that band.  You dont have to ask her out. Just get comfortable with talking to women.When youre finally confident enough to talk with women regularly youre ready to ask someone out. How you do it will depend on you. When I was still dating I didnt like the idea of asking a question like Hey would you like to do something sometime?  This just sounds so cliche I prefer something along the lines of Hey Im doing X thing this weekend. Its amazing! The last time I was there insert funny anecdote happened. Come with me.Most importantly make your intentions clear. Dont dance around with the prolonged friendship thing if you can help it. Girls are more likely to take a stance of valued friendship over a relationship if you dance that way. Why risk a secure friendship for something that might not even work out after all? Nothing worse than finding yourself in the friend zoneLastly have fun with it. If youre stressing out youre doing it wrong. Dating is a blast! Enjoy yourself. ,internetparents,dg5i3v0,4,t5_31jj6
