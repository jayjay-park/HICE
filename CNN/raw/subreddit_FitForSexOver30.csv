Im lucky because I have a great studio in my town that offers a wide variety including some fun events like yoga and wine. Go for it and give it a try. ,FitForSexOver30,d2jp16t,1,t5_3cwf2

7535528,0,t1_d2yqikm,I absolutely agree that many joint issues benefit from increased as do generalized musculoskeletal issues. For my knee issues an exercise bike was recommended specifically a recumbent bike. Recumbent bikes takes the weight and pressure off of many of the joints. I guess my question was more along the lines of Ive heard that running is hard on the joints due to impact. ,FitForSexOver30,d2yr3y5,1,t5_3cwf2

7919201,0,t3_4nps4u,I did well with my workouts this week although my diet could have been better.  I did a workout that was suggested by TallLABull and I can see some definition in my arms.  Instead of doing one set on  different exercises Im going to start doing  sets on  exercises.  I had some nice excuses to party although it looks like that is about to end.  Also my vacation ends and I go back to work tomorrow.Next week is going to be tough to get workouts in  probably only on Wednesday and Friday so Im going to have to be particular with my diet.I learned about the Intermittent Fasting technique of eating for only  hoursday from the AMA.  Prior to it I was often eating for  hoursday or Id have a  calorie protein smoothie in the morning and then eat for an  hour window later in the day.  Ill be doing this next week by default so Ill report how well this works.,FitForSexOver30,d466yim,1,t5_3cwf2
