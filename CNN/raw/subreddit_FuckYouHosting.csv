5438718,0,t3_3pf4pd,HiI want to share my ct. Let me say I understand your thoughts. But...thats not the right way that you going. I see you first some months ago short before your server get hacked. I create a account...and bamm it was gone. Waiting over and over for you to come back. Then you say you fix it. Great! Nothing works. Can register but didnt get any hosting. It says please login after xx sec. And this over and over again. Then suddenly it works. I create a account. It was gone from getting some bruteforced app on. This happens to many sites on your server. Since few days before you wrote about the problem and the donations I try to create  new accounts. I need only one. But not any of them works. Did not get a connection with .onion domain. Some probs on your server Guys!You have to make first everything runs well before you getting rid. It makes more people angry. Angry people dont donate. Happy people do it. I see many many accounts created on your server in the public list that nothing ! on. Why you not give them  hrs. to upload a site. If not...delete it. Thats what all freehosters in CW do.   on your server are empty accounts. Some with bruteforced apps on. That will give you the resources back.Give the customers a free service now and let it open. Look it runs smooth. And give a option to go to a pay or donated upgrade. Name it. Not just a button. Says what they get. It will run...I recommend this as a  FreehostOwner running the biz since y in the CW. ,FuckYouHosting,cw6ulmz,1,t5_35hhq
