2755447,0,t1_cnfrhjg,One thing to consider is to definitely make sure you have at least one donation of record per year  usually a check written to the church for a token amount of  or even as little as  or just .Most or at least many UU congregations require a donation of record i.e. at least some evidence of giving activity before you can VOTE at annual meetings or other similar congregational meetings i.e. in order to be a voting member there has to be some record of you having given at least something financially.Alternately make sure at lease some of the dollars you give in the offering plate are in a marked envelope with your name clearly marked on it so you get credit for the donation.Most UU churches dont have any minimum giving requirements in order to be a voting member but many have a requirement that you gave at least something in some capacity even if but a token amount.,UUreddit,cnha6oh,1,t5_2qpwr

4311027,0,t3_3adb7s,I know what you mean. My mom tells me shes spiritual not religious. And you can still identify as Roman Catholic holding those particular ideas without going to Mass. Im Wiccan even though I dont keep up with the Sabbats or Full Moon Rites. No one can tell me different because its what I feel inside that counts. Do what feeds your soul. If going to Mass or praying doesnt work for you you only cheapen yourself by doing something you dont believe in.,UUreddit,csbkv2y,2,t5_2qpwr
4677553,0,t3_3ezk63,Hi! Welcome to the pnw! Theres a pnw young adult retreat coming up in SeptemberThere are several congregations in the Seattle area. The closest to UW is University Unitarian. Ive visited once and they seemed friendly and my friends who formerly attended there loved it. They produce some rockin youth. Im not familiar with their YA programs but Im sure they have some connections to UW students.  Yes thats really their websiteLater today Ill check in with folks I know at the district and see what other connections you might make.,UUreddit,ctk5k8r,3,t5_2qpwr
4714967,0,t3_3fh8bl,Please consider talking to the minister board member or committee member.  I know my majority white anglo congregation has been struggling with race and culture issues for years. We are located in a majority white majority wealthy town that is adjacent to a majority minority immigrant workingclass town. We have a very active social justice group that has been working with RIM Habitat and the food pantry for years. Weve worked to slowly incorporate small Latino items in to our service such as the chalice lighting. Weve been looking at prison reform voting rights and other systemic issues as well.  We thought we were pretty good until BLM took off. Now we feel inept and inadequate. I think we know that we are missing black voices and unfortunately that can make people look for a black spokesperson. They mean well but thats wrong too. If you dont tell them that they are making you uncomfortable then they will likely keep doing it to the next darker skinned person who walks in.The UUA has some official resources for congregations that were publicized at the GA. I hope that you can get them to knock it off rather than leave. If not you are welcome at my congregation.,UUreddit,ctouzgs,8,t5_2qpwr

One of them was like If you had a bag of candy and some of them were poison you wouldnt eat any you would THROW THE BAG AWAY.

Try no more than  minutes a day.gt hate from all the sides!Keep it professional with coworkers. Walk away headphones back to the business at hands...How awesome are these great friends who are pointing fingers at you and calling each other names? Sounds a touch toxic and lifes too short for that.Must you answer every single one of Moms hourly phone calls to remind you that you should be looking for a better job? Do you have to listen to Dad yap on about whatever? Must you put yourself into situations where its smile and nod for hours on end with no escape?Take a break. Its fine. Know what your max dose of ugly hate from all sides is and adjust your inputs accordingly. You can sacrifice yourself onto the sword of the Social Justice Committee tomorrow or next week.,UUreddit,dd5vc6f,3,t5_2qpwr
10568816,0,t3_5r5egb,Ive been attending my local UU sunday service for four weeks now and I really love it. I guess Im technically an atheist dont believe in the supernatural but I prefer to identify as a Humanist as I find a statement of what I believe in more meaningful than one of what I dont believe in. I also like the idea of pantheism which is the belief that all of reality is identical with divinity or that everything composes an allencompassing immanent God but that GodThe Universe doesnt operate in supernatural ways.My congregation has fairly traditional music organs and choir but the sermons and scripture scripture readings have included everything from the Bible to TaNehisi Coates are very liberal. God and Jesus havent been brought up in a literal way or very much at all and when they have its in a way that I can interpret as metaphor. The music and worship I prefer to call it celebration is something I specfically looked for even when I was shopping around more explicitly atheist groups like Sunday Assembly. The sermons and scriptures help me to reflect on life values and current events.  Im embracing spirituality and I dont think that you have to believe in the supernatural to do so. My spirituality is grounded in celebrating the awesomeness of the universe in a grand way and human love in an interpersonal way. Theres a long tradition with UU of this sort of spiritual but nonsupernatural life stance. I think many atheists my find it uncomfortable at first because we often go through a very antireligious phase when we leave our home religion not all atheists go through this but I think its a fairly common experience that informs a lot of atheist literatureculture. I probably would have felt the same way five years ago but getting into the tradition of Humanism and talking a lot with my more liberally religious friends who are interestingly Episcopalians has primed me for this sort of thing.Thats just my experience though and you should do what makes your comfortable. As others have chimed in I think its perfectly fine to just be involved in the community and not go to the service. Ive met several people who do that at my congregation.,UUreddit,dd6390v,2,t5_2qpwr
11411857,0,t3_62uhv3,An affiliated community minister is usually an ordained and fellowshipped UU minister whose ministry is focused outside a traditional congregation often they are hospital chaplains or do streetprisonhomelessness ministry or are entirely focused on social change ministries. Because of the congregationalist structure of UUism they affiliate themselves with an established congregation and define that relationship in a formal letter or memorandum of understanding which explains how the congregation andor its senior minister will supervise abdor support the affiliated minister and how the affiliated minister will guve back to the congregation often by agreeing to lead worship some number of times andor provide some number of educational or spiritual programs at the congregations meetinghouse.Heres a guide to affiliation from the UU Society for Community Ministries.,UUreddit,dfpitd0,5,t5_2qpwr
