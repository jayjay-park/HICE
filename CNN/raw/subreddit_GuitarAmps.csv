Best case a tube failed and took out a screen resistor and that was the smoke. Worst case the smoke was your output transformer windings melting through their insulation and shorting.

5755693,0,t1_cxahbob,Hmm thats an interesting problem.  I like the idea the guy gave to you in that thread Orange tiny terror is awesome and you could probably experiment with different cab types and speaker combinationsAnother thing that may be the problem is that you use an acoustic guitar with a normal electric guitar amp.  Acoustic guitars put out a lot more overtones and such than electric guitars do so electric guitar amps arent really designed to hit all those frequencies.  This may be why your speaker isnt acting the way it should when you play downtuned like that.  Id say maybe check out some acoustic guitar amps although it sounds like you like pedals a lot and Ive never tried running pedals through an acoustic guitar rig.Another avenue to check out would be a bass amp.  Bass amps are designed to handle a wider array of frequencies than guitar amps.  I love the sound of guitars through bass amps for certain genres Josh Homme played Ampeg bass amps in Kyuss and a lot of Queens of the Stone Age and acoustic guitars sound great through bass amps again wider frequency array.  You might have a hard time getting that tubebreakup but I really think this might be your best bet.  Perhaps this and a nice transparent OD like a soul food or something would give you what youre looking for.Of course this is just speculation but I think that somewhere in here is the answer to your problem.

6633848,0,t3_46iisj,If its humming and popping with nothing plugged it there may be an issue beyond the tubes. But swapping tubes will help diagnose. For the preamp tube swap out one tube at a time to see if you can find the bad tube. Groove Tubes does make tubes they buy them from omanufacturers and relabel them. The R on your preamp tubes means Russian SaratovReflektor the C means Chinese Shunguag. You can use either or any number of other AXECC tube.The Groove Tube hardness rating is nothing more than how hot or cold a tube biases in a given set of conditions. This assumes nonadjustable fixed bias...if you bias the amp to the tubes adjustable fixed bias you can offset the hardness rating and dial in most of the GT tubes to all operate the same. But I digress.You can always just buy a set of GT ELs in the  range or a different range for more or less clean But IIRC the Blues Junior III might now have a bias pot that atech could bias up many matched pairs of EL... Im just not sure if it does.,GuitarAmps,d05hwow,1,t5_2u7ul

7839150,0,t1_d3wzv8s,x will be fairly meaty as is but the pedals will define the tone for the amp. I wouldnt recommend for metal because a lot of people like breakup so imagine whatever it is you are putting through will also control the overall volume rather than just putting a boost for overdrive youll have to dial the pedal more. Which is fine if thats what you want and think pedals sound better than a more natural overdrive. I used more low overdrive and clean sounds and it worked great.

10210473,0,t1_dc1deh8,There really arent many all tube amps that you can plug directly into an interface at that budget. Youre best bet might be a used Hughes amp Kettner TubeMeister TMH because it has a builtin RedBox DI output.Your other option for recording tube direct to interface would be some kind of tube preamp pedal and then run that signal into a power ampcab sim plugin. But if you do that it may actually be cheaper to just plug your guitar into an instrument level input on your interface assuming it has one or into something like a Radial DI box if your interface only accepts linemic levels and then run through software plugins. Youd just need the software theres a number of free plugins like LePou and to set the sample buffer size for your inteface to something usable for live monitoring  or  samples would be a good buffer size for low latency monitoring a smaller buffer is better.,GuitarAmps,dc1exj2,2,t5_2u7ul
