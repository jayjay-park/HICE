4576463,0,t3_3dbaj2,Im also playing an archer and though I absolutely love playing an archer in almost every game this game has to hate us. I dont understand how youve gotten top  dps in a party I do raids quite often have even beaten bajar and my gear score is  and still I almost always get out dpsd by the priests in the party that are more focused on healing. It is a painful sight to see the dps meter and seeing it at like thth. We have all of these aoe skills but the max damage they are doing is like  per hit excluding the k crit from eagle strike while other classes are just dropping damage out the ass. Ive upgraded my strafe arrow rain rapid shot and eagle strike to  and my other skills to  and still cant do shit in a party. Its like a running joke at this point. Shit I even made my archer Blind to represent the damage output thats just not there.,MapleStory2,ct7gy4u,2,t5_2ut5o

7063944,0,t3_4bw1zz,To be honest this is not a surprise since theres a larger population of gamers in China than in the rest of NA. IIRC I remembered reading about CMS having approximately  million players while GMS population was around one quarter to one third of that number. Based on this comparison Nexon would definitely go for the market with the most players since theres potential of a higher yield.,MapleStory2,d1h25k5,1,t5_2ut5o
