3510253,0,t3_2ys6tl,Which Firefox which page which Youtube HTML setting only the HTML player gives you video speed control  IMHO essential for lecture videos and did you enable these settings for HTML Youtube video to get all resolutions Youtube offers not necessary for the Flash playerI had my Firefox crash on me when using HTML  but it really was the ATI video card driver blue screen total system crash. I switched to Chrome because even if its not Firefox thats really causing it I need a solution not somebody to blame. I tried Firefox recently after enabling the above settings and I didnt get a crash but I didnt test for very long.,coursera,cpse5pz,2,t5_2tjfl

7319395,0,t3_4ede8w,I very much enjoyed the Rice Python courses If youre interested in something more intensive and just as frustrating as programming in industry the coding part at least not the bureaucracy part the Algorithms courses by PrincetonAre great if you can catch them. Finally the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng is excellent  the problems are in Matlab but they are great for doing programming from a Math perspective. ,coursera,d2a5y77,1,t5_2tjfl

8819206,0,t1_d77xnku,I know what you mean Ive hoarded a shit ton of courses as well. I wish you the best of luck with contacting Coursera since they dont really do customer service s They really suck in that department. I think it would be faster and easier to simply make a new account. Keep the old one to check them out and use the new one for actual work perhaps? ,coursera,d77y57o,1,t5_2tjfl
9020904,0,t1_d7vqan1, This is important a national accreditation is crap. You want to look for a school with a regional accreditation. Personally Id look for a not for profit school as well based on my experience working for both. ,coursera,d7w66ht,2,t5_2tjfl
