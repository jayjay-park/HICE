8084,0,t3_1u5s93,The thing I dislike most about NaturalNews is that unlike most conspiracy theory sites it actually directly affects the health of human beings. Any site purporting an alternate cancer treatment like oranges or whatever as NaturalNews does is clearly responsible for a lot of pain and perhaps even a bit of unnecessary death from those who could potentially be saved by actual medicine and the things it says about vaccines not only compromises the health of individuals and those around them but undermines the elimination of deadly epidemics that scientists have spent decades trying to get rid of.Some conspiracies make no sense and some are even infuriating to a point but its all minor leagues when it comes to those that actively hurt others.,conspiratocracy,cefcuk7,6,t5_2zjzt

This resulted from fires which were hotter for longer than calculated and from the small insulation thickness.They dont say anything about thermite because no credible scientific body will concede that iron microspheres means a preponderance of evidence for unreacted thermitic material. Thats not the point.The point is that Proe and Thomas refute your own claim that fire was not the cause.I dont need to refute the paper You did it for me. Sorry. ,conspiratocracy,cefvvv3,1,t5_2zjzt

220204,1,t1_cf3i6qj,Honestly I find it pretty entertaining. As someone relatively new to Reddit its funny to watch whole groups of people on two sides of an issue yell the same confirmation bias arguments at each other.  Ive discovered many places around here where injecting nuance or looking for middle ground will get you downvoted to oblivion. ,conspiratocracy,cf3izav,1,t5_2zjzt
