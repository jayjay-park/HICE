8306021,0,t1_d5euu8d,Definitely horrific. I asked my friend Yusif if he saw the report. Bc of Azeri censorship I had to send it to him via FTP but he looked at it and was pretty appalled. In his words I dont fucking get why the fuck Salafi and Wahabbis are willing to behave like animals towards people. Theyre not my brothers. They wouldnt be welcomed at my mosque in Azerbaijan or anywhere within a hundred miles of it. Fuck. Salafis.,realbuddhists,d5ft5g6,1,t5_3ekbw
8307590,0,t1_d5fs9tr,I just know hes Libertarian and that he was a businessman who built his fortune in construction which seems similar to how Donald Trump made his fortune. I can respect how he went from handyman to selling a corporation with over a thousand employees and worth millions of dollars and that was one of New Mexicos leading construction companies. He is also called Veto Johnson for vetoing so many times. Ive also heard he called Donald Trump a racist. Really? I dont think Trumps statements on Mexican illegal immigrants and Muslims make him a racist.But skimming through Gary Johnsons issues on his website he seems alright.,realbuddhists,d5g077v,1,t5_3ekbw
11159644,0,t1_devjy10,Doing a quick search I didnt see much. Asides from the Buddhists in Thailand and Myanmar currently and from the Kalacakra Tantra I dont see much Buddhist crusading against Islam.The fact that Islam bulldozed through the Middle East and Central Asia and northern India and pretty much wiped out Buddhism in those regions gives me further proof of what I think of Buddhism compared to Christianity.If youre going to say something like gtBecause look back on its history.You might want to provide some specific examples. To me telling me to simply look back on Buddhist history isnt enough for me especially since Buddhism spread and developed in diverse places in the world.,realbuddhists,dewxmcj,1,t5_3ekbw
