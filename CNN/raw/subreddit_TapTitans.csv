2841513,0,t3_2smcga,Get Death Seeker and Drunken Hammer as high as you can. Increasing them at the same time should work. Max for Death Seeker is lvl  which gives you base  critical chance.The other artifact you need is Heros Thrust which gives you  critical damage per level. When you hit the walls before Flavius before Chester etc. try to get as far as you can with skill cooldowns before using Midas so you get more gold per monster at the higher levels. And if you cant progress further using Berserker Rage Critical Strike and Shadown Clone at the same time then prestige.Another thing to note Tincture of the Maker is also good but I suggest you have around  artifacts or so to get more damage per level increase.,TapTitans,cnr2swd,1,t5_35ibf

2863467,0,t3_2swb4b,It takes a lot of grinding. I think I had around  all damage before I reached Jaqulin. Youll need to be able to get Chester to around level . Dont bother with evolving Mohacas.Spend your next few prestiges on nothing but unread aura. With level  aura you get x the number of relics it makes the grind for relics a lot easier.After that youll want level  Ogres Gauntlet for perma shadow clone you can get through  of the levels with just shadow clone. It also makes the game a lot easier to play at work you only need to look at it once every  minutes to activate shadow clone and to level things up.Youll also need a lot more tap damage max out your death seeker and level up heros thrust. Most of your damage will come from critical hits. Keep levelling heros thrust until its cost to level is the same as drunken hammer then alternate between the two. Heros thrust increases crit damage by  per level and youll be making crits  of the time. This is approximately equivalent to the  tap damage per level from drunken hammer.Another good thing to aim for is level  crown egg which will give you  chance of chestersons this makes the final grind to e gold a lot easier.,TapTitans,cntksrd,3,t5_35ibf

3112597,0,t1_cohkqls,I would definitely say you are prestiging way too early. By my th prestige I had around  on my artifacts and could get up to the s  of course I was also  weeks into the game. I had the opposite problem of you waiting too long to prestige. I never have minded checking in on the game once an hour at the most to use all my skills tap for a minute and then leave it until the skills reset. When people say you should prestige when you hit a wall they dont mean if you have to use skills to beat a boss  thats what the skills are for. They mean when you get to a point where the next hero you need to unlock is many orders of magnitude more than the last so that attaining them is no longer a short term goal usually that starts at Eistor or Flavius and on. At that point it is more efficient to prestige for a couple hundred or more relics invest in more artifacts and then get back to where you were much quicker this time.You just need to be a bit more patient and try to be more efficient with your runsprestiges. Remember that the further you get in terms of stages the more relics you will get per stage you finish i.e. going from  to  may get you  extra relics but going from  to  gets me an extra  relics.EDIT When you say so slow what exactly are we talking here? How long of noskills tapping does it take to kill a monster? What about a boss with all skills running? And are you going back and getting all the skills on previous heroes when things start to slow down the ones that now cost so little they basically seem free?,TapTitans,cokmbdp,1,t5_35ibf

3678675,0,t3_32hv93,Heres my take on a possible solutionRetain the current offline environment of the game because from what Ive read this is one of the main reasons most people play in the first place but make it so that local saves have a copy on the serverside. If the local save and serversided save do not match then an investigation of that account should be conducted. Of course to filter out abnormalities there should be some sort of sanity checker in place as per uTRBs suggestion which would be developed over time to be more thorough. The selling point of this method is to retain the offline gaming experience where the save file would sync whenever an internet connection is available while weeding out chesters. Im sure there my theory isnt perfect so feel free to provide criticism.,TapTitans,cqbld7h,2,t5_35ibf

3688144,0,t1_cqcnnwk,Well of course making them attack faster increases their damage per second. But that doesnt increase their Damage.. if you know what I mean.Its like when you level shadow clone it hits way more times so your DPS is higher... but your tap damage is the same hope you get what im talking about.So if they outright increase the value of the damage on the heroes then it will affect your tap damage as well. What you said doesnt completely make sense to me. So... if they change warcry to raise the DAMAGE of your heroes but leaves your tap damage unaffected... isnt the end result the same? The reason its so useless now is because it doesnt affect your tap damage it increases your heroes DPS by quite a large margin but since its already so low it doesnt have a meaningful impact. No matter what they do to the skill if it doesnt somehow affect your tap damage then it will be useless. Unless they literally buff it by like x. ,TapTitans,cqco8o5,1,t5_35ibf

The COMMUNITY mods on the other hand are also contributing to the  similar crap threads and also whining together with the players. I have had my reservations about some of them being good mods but Im not playing the blame game here. Being a subreddit mod means youre the sheriff. You maintain the peace and order on the sub and clean out unconstructive shit not contribute to the shit. I dont think I saw biehn complaining anywhere but again I didnt read all the  shit posts. He merely made a PSA about how theres no more permaclone. And yes calm the fuck down everyone. If you want to quit you dont have to create a thread to broadcast your decision. Quit. Nobodys stopping you. I understand that this game is Tap Titans and not Auto Titans but the devs have to understand if you ever read this we players are already enduring a  hour clone to  for a measly k AD increase. Nobodys going to stomach manually tapping for  hours straight for that. Heck nobodys even got the time to sit down and tap for four hours. I would rather get a macro for that.

3824636,0,t3_3487jt,Sorry if someone has already come up with this specific idea there are too many threads at the moment.But my idea if you dont want there to be a permashadow clone is to have the ability to skip like people have said.The calculation Im thinking isAll Damage x   Tap damage x   Crit damage   x Crit chanceThis will give you a figure that you could use to determine how many levels they could skip at the beginning.Then also allowing the CD atrefact to be levelled up higher so it was only about  to wait. Or something because as has been said a lot one shotting for  hours is dull even with the clone.I made a thread but then saw this so yeah .,TapTitans,cqs8p25,1,t5_35ibf

Most of us dont care for the feeling of accomplishment as much as getting a chance to complete our weapon sets and because there is no limit to those that can receive first prize the prize takes priority over competition.To make it a true and pure competition theyd have to make the bracket size maybe  or  and there would be no other reward other than maybe the devs placing the top  players on reddit and facebook.,TapTitans,cqu2dls,3,t5_35ibf

4101247,0,t3_37li8h,Its not a bad idea but itd be a huge amount of work.To start theres the problem of scale  Tap Titans through Google Play has what MM installs? So you have a gigantic marketplace to manage which causes problems for interface and data transfer unless you limit things somehow.Ok so maybe you limit trading to between friends  that makes sense and it also adds some incentives to use the multiplayer feature. Youd still need an entirely new interface for seeing what weapons your friends have or for marking your own weapons as for sale and if prices arent fixed youd need a way of agreeing to a trade. These things arent trivial but ok lets say that work isnt an issue.Cheaters  we know that they exist and are a problem so how would they play into this marketplace? Given that they have infinite everything wouldnt they just be flooding the market with DL weapons? Should you be considered a cheater if you get a weapon from a cheater?Speaking of DL weapons I dont know how sustainable a market would be. Lets say that the market is introduced. Theres an initial flood of nonDL weapon trading as everyone finishes a bunch of sets but after a while I suspect that the market would be dominated by people looking for DL weapons without being able to get any. Why would you ever trade away a DL weapon? Ok maybe you really need a nonDL weapon for a set but itd probably be really easy to find someone who can provide that for a different nonDL.And then theres collusion  if prices arent fixed could you just shuffle entire sets between players? Could you trade during tournaments? Ok just prohibit trading during tournaments but whats to stop you using the combined weapons of a number of friends to get super far prestige pass them all to the next friend etc. Also doesnt have to be friends  what about people with multiple accounts?Also I think this would just further the problem of the rich getting richer  people with a lot of weapons would have a lot more flexibility in trading and so be able to complete sets more easily resulting in getting even more weapons etc.Anyways. I dont think that trading is a bad idea it just needs some thought if the devs were to ever pursue it. Also there are probably other ideas to solvehelp with the setless sage problem that require a lot less work having the daily dungeon weapon always be a weapon that you would need? weighting the probabilities of weapons by how many you already have? adjusting rewards to be like x random weapons y that you need?,TapTitans,crnrmz7,1,t5_35ibf

When tournaments were rolled out they were meant to throw you in with  random people so maybe the brackets arent as broken up as we think they are. My thought is that maybe the only two real brackets are the hell bracket at the top to try to catch cheaters and a beginners bracket at the bottom to help newer players have a chance to earn some weapons quickly. Then everyone between those two brackets are thrown in by time like the tournaments were initially meant to be.,TapTitans,crqfs4m,2,t5_35ibf

So what I just did was to reset my game by clearing all the data or by reinstalling it. And as I progress into the game its useful to put time on tapping than on keeping it offline I did it some time ago. Tap damage outscales passive hero DPS quite a lot so tapping is merely a must in playing the game. ,TapTitans,cry5qme,1,t5_35ibf

4213227,0,t3_394z56,Universal Fissure should be Tier  at minimum due to its high AD.RoWC and Ring of Opulence should be down a tier.Divine Chalice and Amulet of Valrunes are tier  at best.Im not even going to keep going this isnt a good breakdown of artifacts for tournaments.

4227678,0,t1_cs213cl,Thanks for your input. I tried to do simple calculation about my gains and losses if I were to put UA straight to Lv.. Assuming i clear the same max stage im capped with for every prestige when farming relics the relic gains are too low and the cost is high. Maybe later on it will benefit me more at stage  onward. Yeah i guess the focus is on Damage and Gold gains for now since this is what lacks the most then proceed with relics per stage strategy. ,TapTitans,cs24r91,1,t5_35ibf

4464908,0,t3_3c9ebz,Its ranked low because the efficiency of the functionincreasing Monster Golddisappears due to the combination of Crown Egg and Chest of Contentment. They both respectively increase the likelihood of Chestersons which are considered their own monster and the gold dropped from a Chesterson. Depending on your artifact levels and what you have Amulet may be considered your best artifact for gold and damage. However this is the list I think is best to go by Chest of Contentment Crown Egg This phases out when you hit  except for when upgrading it will be cheapest AD gain and drops to third worst above Amulet and DC Crafters Elixir Knight Shield Futures Fortune Divine Chalice Im inclined to rank this over Amulet because its cheaper to upgrade and with that your AD grows more over time Amulet of Valrunes,TapTitans,csth9on,4,t5_35ibf

5127148,0,t1_cv3jerh,Realistically youre not gonna increase your total hero levels by  or even   past  minutes of farming close to your max stage. Sure go for it if youre close to an opponent but thats unlikely to happen. That time afterwards is better spent starting a new prestige and getting more DmgE so that your next prestige in a few hours would push you further than the previous one. We cant be super efficient if we want to push in tourneys but at the same time we shouldnt push it to the point where there is virtually no benefit and only wasted time. ,TapTitans,cv40i25,1,t5_35ibf

5304689,0,t3_3nnqqk,That guide still works well. You just need to use iExplorer instead. In iExplorer create a backup of your iPhone  I recommend deleting everything in your phone except TT if possible if not itll take awhile to backup. Then just navigate Backup Explorer gt TapTitans folder gt Documents gt Save files. Then just drag and drop the save files onto your desktop and follow the subsequent steps in the guide where you have to add the word files to the front of the each filename. Note that when I did the transfer I transferred all  files basically all the .backup and the .adat and adat.old files into the Android folder cause I noticed there were  .backup files in Android. But Ive been told that just transferring the  files like in the guide also works. Edit Do also note that once you transfer it to Android it is extremely difficult to transfer it back to iOS unless you have iOS . and earlier or its jailbroken.,TapTitans,cvpqhwg,1,t5_35ibf

7573810,0,t3_4ib25u,Im in the same tourny as TTBodyCount as well but I plateau around . Where did I go wrong that Im paired with people every tourny including Mondays that just stomp my max. Ive got a coworker who recently started and he is screaming up on my tail because he keeps getting in the top  every tournament including Mondays so he almost has a full weapon set at k damage while Im at k damage and have less weapons than him.Edit this post was originally for a different tournament sorry to revive a dead post.,TapTitans,d333st0,1,t5_35ibf
7599635,0,t3_4jcqt3,Yeah its a glitch where if the previous creaturemonster is killed too quickly and the next creaturemonster spawns it doesnt quite colorize properly. Never happens to bosses though. No difference in gold payout just a glitch.,TapTitans,d361gr1,1,t5_35ibf

7686100,0,t3_4klk2z,Well if you have some diamonds to spend salvage the first few artifacts to get as many of those  that have  ad aswell as the WI equivilant which has  ad and those others with  and  ad because All Damage is going to be the main stat to look out for for the first like  prestiges.After that you dont really have to keep rerolling artifacts everything that yields  gold   monster gold   boss gold etc is good.,TapTitans,d3fv1b1,2,t5_35ibf
7689909,0,t1_d3g6850,Hmm... Not sure though. It could possibly be the same equation as in W. The value is added to heroSkillAllDamage multiplier not overall multiplier. ,TapTitans,d3gakk2,1,t5_35ibf

I dont know how to do the math so im going to guess  to  is going to cost around bb. I get aa per monster kill. Which wouldnt be horrible if it didnt take  taps to kill anything that isnt a boss.

8136370,0,t1_d4uiltk,Yes and no... Early versions of the game didnt have a stage cap.. And infinity golddamage was easy to achieve and the rest is history.Infinity golddamage was a happy unintended aspect of the game. Current version has anti infinity damage,TapTitans,d4ulok0,1,t5_35ibf
8160662,0,t1_d4xm3st,I usually dont push hard enough to get to my MS. Personally it isnt worth my extra time right now just for possibly one extra weapon.

8209774,0,t1_d53k07d,Yes its legit. You might barely hit  for now but soon you can hit  as long as you play the game. Ive been there and now I can hit  and I just started this January . Maybe those people started playing the game since Tap Titans was initially released which was  I guess. So if I have also played since  I might be able to hit that stage too. Also weapon sets help a lot.,TapTitans,d53rz19,1,t5_35ibf

9468350,0,t3_5ag2rh,Well you can think theyre fair game all you like the devs though do not. They give you an advantage over people who put time and effort into the game that you havent earned. Yatto uses only the information available to you. None of the data it uses is gained through means that go against the game.
