81751,0,t1_cekuyls,As I said I dont have full insight into these discussions just bits and pieces. All I know is that people in the clubs have been trying to get a real solution for this problem for over  years but the governing body dunno which one doesnt wanna hear about it. So they have done what they can with the resources they have. Neighboring airports know about this and we share the same soaring airspace as them. We open these airspaces every time we tow by calling to Arlanda biggest airport in Sweden so they know about it as well. The problem here is that the airplane that came was coming from a far flying under our soaring airspace to avoid it.Now with video evidence some media rattle it seems we might finally get a solution to this year when we start towing again. Worst that can happen is that they deny all towing activities and that would be a huge death blow to paragliding in Sweden as large amounts of the pilots live in flat lands.,freeflight,cenqifo,1,t5_2v02s

1532480,0,t1_cj63if2,I agree with dabarnes completely I use the A and CD technique myself...however I also know plenty of pilots that use your technique with good results. I think the important thing here is probably to get used to breaking the wing or bringing it up slower so it doesnt overshoot as it did in the video. ,freeflight,cj8dfqa,1,t5_2v02s
1629306,0,t3_2czeq0,For the french system assuming you can read some french   Basically  even though no training is mandatory the classic scheme is  First week around  Euro you do groundhandling and your first  to  real flights  Second week again around  Euro you do more flighs in less quiet air and you get Brevet initial. With that you can join a club where an Accompagnateur de club can give you advices and tips  You fly solo within a club Eveningmorning or you take another course and when you have  to  flights you should have the level for the Brevet de piloteThe important part is to know when you can takeoff and when you shouldnt ,freeflight,cjkjesr,4,t5_2v02s

2669702,0,t1_cn6tnoo,I dont have any proof for this just what i have seen while in the air with hang gliders. Paragliders seem to do better in weak conditions small thermals and does low saves better. The low saves is probably due to thermals being smaller closer to the ground.,freeflight,cn71xz3,2,t5_2v02s

Since there is no cell reception out there its kind of hard to judge the weather since there is one rural weather station out there which isnt the most accurate to the bluffs so its always a gamble.

4488316,0,t3_3ckf40,When looking for a camera to go flying with one of the top things you should be looking for is availability of third party mounts specific to the sport.While the GoPro is far from my favourite camera out there hilariously bad battery it has this quality in strides.As mentioned previously helmet mounts present a real safety hazard. If you still want to go that route consider buying a snag free mount built for skydiving or just duct taping the crap out of your mount to simulate the same effect.Chasecam mounts are super fun and present great views. While they look easy to build I wouldnt recommend it unless you know how to shop and build with carbon fibre. Using anything heavier will cause more pendulum motion from the mount during any pitching or rolling. Wingman cam makes a great product I recommend you start there.Also this is a mornings only kind of toy. If you are going to go up in turbulent air leave the Chasecam in the car. ,freeflight,cswexff,2,t5_2v02s

4914071,0,t1_cudtiml,gt No wing collapses out of nowhere.That is just simply not true. Pulling aggressive maneuvers on hot wings close to the ground is what causes most paraglider accidents. I know someone who was seriously injured from a collapse out of nowhere when he was coming in for a normal landing on an average day. It happens. By being aware of this possibilty we can reduce our chances of injury or death.,freeflight,cudyerh,0,t5_2v02s

6368184,0,t3_42ugds,not to pile on you even more here but do you have any background? Have you tried a tandem? Skydived before? Im afraid the teaching yourself to climb comparison really isnt a fair one. There are no flying gyms or easy top ropes to cut your teeth on and you cant set protection on flat land and try it out before placing it for real. Sure you can go to nice open field and try out kiting to your hearts content but flying is different. Are there any good training hills where you live? I get the self reliance piece Im the same way but a delta is a hot wing that is a generation or two out of date so performancewise you arent even getting THAT much benefit out of it and getting the basics of launches and landings are pretty tough by yourself. As uXames said still air is pretty easy but there are a LOT of ways you can mess yourself up by not realizing a front is moving in the air is too thermic for your skill level launching into rotor etc. ,freeflight,czdhr2j,1,t5_2v02s

8281405,0,t1_d59trdv,there is an interview out now with the pilot apparently he lost control after a manoeuvre so probably had a big twist jamming the breaks he thought he was going to go into the water so was uncliped and got ready to jump however the wing turned and looked like it was going to go into the beach. Hung on to make sure he cleared the beach and possibly taking out people on the beach. he ended up jumping as he was still out of control and picking up speed.  ,freeflight,d5cqgm9,1,t5_2v02s
