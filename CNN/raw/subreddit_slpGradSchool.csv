6304179,0,t3_41mckb,I find it easiest to hum the words or phrases to decipher where the stress is. You have to hum it quickly though. If you go too slow you may over think it.,slpGradSchool,cz67qb1,0,t5_39xqx
7066508,0,t1_d1hbupy,I have a phonetics class that I would be transferring over and was approved by Davies and others. I sent the syllabus to her and was responded to promptly. That would be helpful. I have heard of ENMUs prereq program but USU online has been recommended by various graduate students on here and on other forums. It is harrowing to read about your experience with the admissions and slp staff. ,slpGradSchool,d1hcnhs,2,t5_39xqx
7264971,0,t3_487gfe,I had an F and some Ds on my transcript as well as a cumulative GPA below .. This was all due to some personal stuff that was going on which I briefly addressed in my SOP. Was accepted to two programs my second year applying also beefed up my resume with literacy tutoring and an extra prerequisite so its totally possible. I did a lot of emailing to see which programs would consider me. Good luck! ,slpGradSchool,d23z55z,1,t5_39xqx

9280537,0,t3_57hqfx,My program does the post bacc within the Masters for students who needed it. So like I was accepted into the program completed all the prerequisites at that school and then started the Masters program. I go to St. Cloud State University in Minnesota.,slpGradSchool,d8sdib0,1,t5_39xqx

11467917,0,t3_63jam7,The general consensus from this sub seems to be pick the cheapest option. If you want to work in a medical setting then Id say that advice alters slightly to pick the cheapest option that can provide medical placements. Personally I think k is too much debt to take on when you look at salaries in this field. But I probably have that perspective because Im an older student who has lived through paying off student loans.Regarding applying for a PhD.. Ive never sat on an admissions committee but I highly doubt the name of the school on your clinical degree registers more than a passing glance. I think theyd be much more concerned with your research experience which you could get under a good professor anywhere and whether your research interests align with an available PIs focus. You already know your stats are fine because you got into this round of grad school.Whatever you choose congratulations!,slpGradSchool,dfvvrnz,1,t5_39xqx
