Ive filed your request on a master list. Thanks for the feedback.,getnarwhal,crdfz60,2,t5_3134t
4356841,0,t1_csgqwpf,Sure! Basically say I go to my front page or all and tap a post I could then swipe from right to left to go to the next item on the page and it would load in the same format.

4887143,0,t3_3hthq6,This is due to the fact that narwhals markdown support is very limited atmI am not the developer but i understand that implementing this is a tradeoff die to the following reasonAtm narwhal is i assume using native controls to display the text which makes rendering fast and easy. to extend markdown support without reinventing the wheel the developers would need to change that to use web views for reach comment displaying tiny bits of html.This could possibly impact scrolling performance impact battery usage and make it harder to have a consistent look throughout the interface youd need stylesheets to make tables for example match the look of the rest of the appSo doing this comes with a big tradeoff and i wouldnt expect the devs to make a rushed decision on this. If they decide to implement it they would probably take quite a bit of time to make sure the implementation is flawless.tldr this is a harder feature than it looks like from the outside. It might very well take some time til er get this if ever.,getnarwhal,cuak9iv,7,t5_3134t

6316990,0,t1_cz7mhfy,No problems! Anything to make this App even better . By the way are you guys planning to fix the Front Page where you see all the posts from your subscriptions. The way is set up that it doesnt show the thumbnails quite good in most of the threads before you click them. I know theres the other option where you can see the big thumbnails but what I dont like about it is that it makes the feed longer since the thumbnails are below the titles and not next to them to make it more compact. Also some of them show the full imagine instead of just a thumbnail. I hope you guys improve this in the default sorted feedback. Edit heres an example of what I mean look at the Thumbnails in the default style feed  what I would like is for you to make it a bit more larger but remaining next to the titles so the experience is better and more enjoyable. I mean who doesnt love thumbnails specially on links hehe!  ,getnarwhal,cz7o6ga,1,t5_3134t

The official reddit app has a safe for work toggle which is activated when that app ships so that only safe for work content is available. Are you saying that Apples problem is that the old Narwhal toggles use the NSFW label? Perhaps you could just copy the toggle label safe for work thats used by the official reddit app and should the user select to view adult content only then make the various thumbnail options for NSFW content etc available? I just hate to see those options go to waste. ,getnarwhal,d1zeqv3,5,t5_3134t
