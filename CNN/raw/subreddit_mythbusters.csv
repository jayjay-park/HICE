They interview kids edit the footage so that you see darling little kids spitting out stereotypical kids things and they call that think tank and then Jamie and Adam load off their work on their builders to come up with some dangerous toys. Not a single kid involved.It is more of that typical and boring mythbusters totally pointless destruction material... they have been completely overdoing that stuff the last  or  seasons. Just blowing shit up JUST BECAUSE for no other reason than for the lulz and omg so cool destruction!. It is cheap material to shoot. Dangerous Toys is more of that but they completely dropped the wannabescience aspect that mythbusters has been desperately trying to cling on to.Remember how mythbusters was trying to be all scientific about does water extinguish fire? in the last episode? DangerousToys instead has Adam throwing artificial pissfilled balloons at Jamie just because it MIGHT deter Jamie and because they edited the kidfootage so there was water balloon and stink in there.

1733355,0,t1_cjxazea,I kind of agree with you.  The first season without the build team was still an interesting show that I was willing to watch but they stretched out as much as they could just to fit an hour.When they introduced the build team it was a great way to cover more myths in the same amount of time and break up each episode.  It wasnt all on just Adam amp Jamie we had Grant Kari Scottie and Tory to help out.  This helped the show fill out the alotted time slot more evenly with interesting content so more people were inclined to watch.However nowadays weve run into the same problem.  Discoverys producers have fucked with the show so much to where were back to only two myths per episode and we only get the bare minimum of how each myth is tested. More annoying theres barely a quiet moment in any of the episodes these days.  The music is constantly flourishing and if it isnt the narrator is repeating himself from  seconds ago.I dont think the answer is removing the build team I think the answer is going back to the format of Seasons .  Otherwise cut the show down to  minutes.,mythbusters,cjxnjts,3,t5_2qtxd

4494355,0,t3_3cfn7r,Im not sure how to quantify it but Ive always wondered is a bullet with a very hot load as in more propellant not temperature hotter is more accurate through a short barrel than a coldload bullet shot through a longer barrel. So say you have a . rifle that has the minimum barrel length for a full bullet turn. Say the rifling is  inches have a  inch barrel. You load it with a normal . LR round shoot some shit see how accurate it is.Then you have a rifle of the same make that has a longer barrel meaning more turns. Could be double triple I honestly dont know what would be best. You load it with a subsonic . LR round shoot some shit see how it differs from the other rifle.From what I see in my own bits of research the difference between the velocities of normal and subsonic . LR bullets is fps except I dont know how much this is dependent on barrel length. I know a longer barrel means more acceleration but I dont know how much of the acceleration is instant from the loads potential energy becoming mechanical. We would get to learn a bit about the applied physics in firearms as well as the weapons mechanics. And of course while I use . as an example Im sure you have some more sizable tools at your disposal if need be. Hint hint.,mythbusters,csx67bj,2,t5_2qtxd

Unfortunately for some reason he couldnt link which club to use at which point but that could be because he didnt play enough... the learning curve depends just as much on the player as it does on the game to provide help.That being said it makes little sense to compare how will you do physically as they did with posture. The game clearly doesnt teach you about it but even then knowing it was important since filmed it indoors for comparison Jamie could have at least tried to emulate the game character but this is part of the gamer mentality that he lacks!,mythbusters,cud2j3n,17,t5_2qtxd

5579307,0,t1_cwolz56,Well what he said in response to what is the best segment youve done are that its impossible to answer but that the U segment was particularly astonishing. And that from a storytelling perspective its one of the best. I didnt find the story all that compelling and with respect the show used to be about testing things in creative and unique ways not storytelling how two TV FX artists managed to score a free ride on a superexclusive spy plane. I dont think Adam flying in the U really moved testing the myth along in any meaningful way any more than interviewing U pilots would have. It was just an excuse to get Adam into a cool plane. He doesnt explicitly cite it as the best segment overall but its the first one he thinks of in response to the question and he doesnt give any more definitive answer. Then he mentions loving going from the Simpsons to Indiana Jones. Again this is in response to a question about the best segments theyve done. These are the things that come to his head. He didnt immediately think of Pyramid power one that we know he considers to be pure trash that they never should have done  he raises these three in particular. IMO that means in his mind he at least equates them to some of the best segments of the series and I really disagree.I respect that he doesnt explicitly state that these are his best segments but I think theres an implication that they are up there for him.gtLooking back what is the best segment youve ever done?gtSAVAGE Its almost impossible to answer. I was particularly astonished at our Flights of Fancy episode last season. My flight in the U I think thats the loveliest segments from a cinematography and storytelling perspective.

If you enjoy watching those Top Ten or  or  or  or what the fuck ever videos on YouTube then you will enjoy this I guessThere are a handful of really funny moments but I dont think it ever get better than in the first episode with the mind control dealie.  I think you can find that clip on YouTube though.Its absolutely not a must watch series.,mythbusters,dgf1zcd,1,t5_2qtxd
