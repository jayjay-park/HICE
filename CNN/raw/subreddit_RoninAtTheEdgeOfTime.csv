However most ronin are focused on the war that takes place at the Edge of Time  the final battle for all in the Land of the Button.Cant pressers may have a place in this battle too and they are welcome at the Edge of Time.  For even those without a sword may have a role to play in the Game of Buttons.  ,RoninAtTheEdgeOfTime,crqtvsh,6,t5_37oxw
