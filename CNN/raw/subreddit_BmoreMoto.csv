1585972,0,t3_2cfzua,It is fast and fun. I took it at HCC but it is the same thing really. Once you pass they give you a certificate that you can then take to the MVA to get a M endorsement on your license. If you have no experience on a motorcycle or dirt bike I suggest you take the basic course as this will teach you everything. If you know how to use a clutch on a bike and can keep it up right take the alternate riders course. It takes a lot less time. If you half way pay attention during the riding portion you will have no problem passing the written test. Most my class failed the riding test but they do let you come back another day and retry the test. ,BmoreMoto,cjf30wg,1,t5_31yk9

I guess its time for me to come back.These two situations are very unfortunate because you had no control over them and you were not in the wrong but sadly there will always be idiots on the road whether youre in a car or on a motorcycle. However I think in general its a smarter move take our time lay low and not piss off people  its very easy to give off the wrong message when blasting pass someone at three times their speed after tailgating them for a while. After all we ride for the fun of it not to be chased around by maniacs.As for the GoPro I think its a great idea. Ive been thinking about it for a while too. ,BmoreMoto,cjkpf64,1,t5_31yk9

4942185,0,t1_cufh313,I got this silver impregnated burn cream from my aunt. Put that on it a few times a day and changed the dressing for about  months. It wasnt healing fast enough so I stopped using the stuff. Big mistake. It instantly scabbed up and hurt a little when I moved my arm. But it did healish in two weeks after that. I think the cream prevented a clot and had noouchies mixed in. Might be worth talking to your doc about getting a prescription. On the bright side mine looks like almost normal skin  years later. The twothree years after my road rash it would tan  times faster and just be dark.I have a guy who can fix it if time isnt a concern. Youll just have to nudge him a little as you get ready to ride again. But on the bright side hell keep in his garage until he gets around to it.,BmoreMoto,cuhi2pd,1,t5_31yk9

5245682,0,t1_cvi9ga3,With the stock stuff I couldnt both control weight transfer hard braking or hard on the throttle properly AND have plush feel over bumps. I had to compromise on both the front preload and on the damping all around. The Ohlins stuff lets me do both at the same time... it feels a LOT better. With the stock stuff set up to control weight transfer well it felt like I was riding with no suspension at all.I also prefer the way the Ohlins stuff is adjusted. All adjusters for damping and preload are on top of the forks... rebound on one side and compression on the other. That also helps simplify forks since each side only does one thing. The adjusters on the shock are both right on top of it right in front of the reservoir and are very easy to get to. Also every change made to the forks adjustment or shock adjustment makes an obvious difference. I had mine installed and set up at MRP... but their settings seemed a little too stiff on bumpy roads so I pulled  click of compression front and back  clicks of rebound up front and one click of rebound in back and now it feels perfect to me. With the stock stuff it was a pretty good bit more difficult to really feel the small changes especially on the shock and there wasnt that much adjustability there compared to the Ohlins stuff.,BmoreMoto,cvial1e,1,t5_31yk9

7695011,0,t1_d3guqqm,This is awesome thanks.Ive read about the lever gapadjustment. Mine appears to be in within spec mm of freeplay but Ill play with it a little when Im near home tonight just to see if there is any effect.At this point it is just a minor nuisance but I dont want something to happen when Im on one of my several hundred mile expeditions somewhere.Based on my research there is apparently an upgrade kit From Barret for this model that replaces with friction plate springs and bolts because the manufacturers units werent the greatest design.If the clutch cable adjustment doesnt do much Im probably just going to replace everything in the case just to be safe. Id gotten a few quotes for around  to do this from RampD and Petes I know I know I know...I wouldnt actually Id just as well save the few hundred bucks learn something and feel confident about the work.Thank again I may touch base again before I do the work.,BmoreMoto,d3gvfpk,2,t5_31yk9
