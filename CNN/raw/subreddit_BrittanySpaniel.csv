524825,0,t1_cfzs84z,This is important to add mariie Brittanies are the best dogs you will ever own. Theyre extremely friendly towards adults kids babies other dogs and animals that arent birds. Theyre loyal gentle and trustworthy. They have quirks Ive never seen in any other dogs. Mine is a comedian he does the funniest things. I could go on and on about the breed. Dont let the energy level scare you away! ,BrittanySpaniel,cfzxfmc,3,t5_2vm1g

5052843,0,t3_3k5tmp,My  year old Brittany would swim by the kayak for a  minute trip around the lake a little over . kilometers if Im gauging distances right.  She then came part of the way back before asking to come up onto the kayak hopped off toward the end and swam the last leg.My second Brittany her pic is top post on rBrittanySpaniel was about  months old when she decided to bolt for Lake Ontario.  We were walking by the beach dogs off leash and she went for the water.  It was April.  In Canada.  She loved it and it took coaxing to get her out.  Went up the lake with her and the then fifteen year old and she was straight into the water.  Swims for half the day runs for the other half.,BrittanySpaniel,cuv253m,3,t5_2vm1g

9947754,0,t3_59jgwz,We had  Brits over the years with my parents.  knew how to open doors and just went whenever wherever. Exhausting. They all turned quite couch potato pretty fast. They have their energetic moments but calm down pretty fast even at old age. The last one who is now  has taken for an habit to take a nap with my dad in the afternoon. She waits for him and if doesnt come she naps alone. Oh and I am from Brittany. ,BrittanySpaniel,db47ui8,1,t5_2vm1g
