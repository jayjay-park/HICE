A friend can get you back on your feet to  in about  minutes just running the first two quests on Torment VI at which point youre strong enough to go quest on your own with  passives and a bunch of abilities unlocked!

850239,0,t3_23uttq,Here is my data. It was collected automatically with rd party tools aka against TOS... but the data is still legit.      Elite kills means champion elite boss named ect. Every elite in the pack counts as its own kill limitation of automated recording. You could divide those numbers by  to get approximations I think   edit I mostly run TT rifts but the data also includes a decent amount of split farming especially earlier on the expansion. The legendhour rates are higher than what you might be use to because this data only factors play time in game and not in town,d3hardcore,ch0xd2c,1,t5_2swfl

1100139,0,t3_26pu3k,I agree with everything said so far.Do it.  It is like a different game.  Losing a character is hard though so be prepared.I would also say dont play in public games if you can avoid it  there are lots of tricks that people use to try and get you killed and even innocent mistakes happen that can get you killed.  Playing solo or only with friendsclan is your best bet.  If you do play public games pay close attention to everything going on.  And dont play on a difficulty youre not sure you can take!!,d3hardcore,chtcabz,1,t5_2swfl

10157123,0,t3_5j3biw,I think youll find your home in D Hardcore from what youve stated and how youve replied to other posts. In reference to the st response yes T and T are the same mobs but the complexity of the scenarios at hands increases dramatically! If youre wanting to stay on the Leaderboard youll find it challenging for sure. Just as an example check out the Monster scaling to give you some insight In addition to that the  of affixes on the mobs increases as well as difficulty goes up when youre juggling  Elites at once avoiding Death on a HC toon youll feel your heart race which I live for.  I think the game is very social and very respectful of individual play as well. Ive been a long time officer of LAW  years. We have a pretty active clan all things considered comprised of Hardcore and Softcore alike. Mostly  now. If you want to party people will always be happy to if not and you like to solo that is cool too. Teamwork is very important in Cooperative play. Stacking beneficial buffs or debuffs for mobs is incredibly important for climbing. Playing with a dedicated group will give you that sudo feeling of Raiding Mythics with your  man party from WoW etc. You have someone controlling Mobs typically a Monk or Barb current meta coupled with usually another Support role or a few DPS. Many playstyle combinations will work to get you into the  Range of GRs however usually only a few optimized group configurations will rise to the .All in all D HC is a great game for a challenge with as much of a social aspect as you desire.If you follow  simple rules youll generally do fine in HC.  Always have your Cheat Death passive on if you Proc just back off.  Only do content youre comfortable with  Keep your nd best piece of gear in the Stash youll want the back upsIf youre looking for a welcoming and engaged Clan hit me up. Im happy to answer any questions you have about the game gearing stat priority etc.IGN Inciter,d3hardcore,dbvd73o,1,t5_2swfl
