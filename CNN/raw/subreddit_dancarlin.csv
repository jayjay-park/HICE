I understand he has to show at least an attempt to put his promises through but at the same time he has to be aware that the push back will be immediate. Also the roman republic fell for completely different reasons.The truth is no party is trying to govern based on the principles of a constitutional republic.  Ever since s it has constant increase in executive power as both parties grow more vicious and cartoonish in their painting of the opposition. The republic is dying and everyone knows it. When we became the only real superpower in the world the death was unavoidable.   Power would concentrate into one office.Just like the Romans. When Carthage fell the Mediterranean had one master. The base of the republics power was based on the people. After it was the holdings.  American is in the same position. We have more foreign bases then domestic ones. We have turned all most all of the world into vassal states. Republic work for agrarian societies but multi continental political governments are always Empire. And they all ways have a emperor.  People arent upset because they think Trump is the emperor. Everyone just wants to make sure that they can put their own guys in to ensure a election that ensures their emperor has the office. Republicans want to slow immigration to ensure a eventual conservative emperor. Democrats want to increase immigration to ensure a liberal one.We are in the middle of a waiting game.
