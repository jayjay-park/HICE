917875,0,t1_ch8h352,I personally dont like combining ck with learning to barefoot for a couple of reasons. First its almost impossible to sustain a heelfirst foot fall when you are completely unshod and on hard surfaces. This means that for the vast majority of people  you are learning a new stride and therefore using new muscles increasing your potential for injury. Second the fact that it is a fixed schedule means there is a disincentive to stop when it hurts.Do one or the other not both.,BarefootRunning,ch8m9oh,1,t5_2rp0r

1468295,0,t3_2aygk3,I bought some Zemgear Playas last year for around  because my school wouldnt let me go barefoot liabilities and whatnot.  They were the thinnest lightest shoes ive ever worn. I could feel the pebbles on the ground but not in a painful way. It was almost as good as going barefoot but safer since I mostly wore them for running at night. I tried on a pair of someone elses vibrams to see how they felt they felt significantly thicker than the zemgears.Unfortunately they were too thin for running. I just bought them off Amazon and later realized that the pair I bought were meant for beach running and walking. The sole started forming holes after a few months and the seam around the sole started to rip. Im certain that they fixed these issues and released newer models of that shoe but ive already transitioned to full barefoot.They were great shoes while they lasted and extremely comfortable. Theyre a tight fit for a few minutes but mold to fit your feet because its like an elastic material. People often asked why I was wearing socks which got annoying quickly. The grip on slippery surfaces wasnt the greatest but forefoot striking provides a lot of control so you shouldnt slip often. Also dont get them wet. They feel like wet socks when wet. At least they dry quickly.If youre looking to transition to complete barefoot Zemgear makes some good shoes for that. I dont know about the durability of other pairs so someone else will have to touch on that. Most of the shoes should be unisex. All shoes are unisex if you really think about it. Feet are all the same. Female barefoot shoes just use a different sizing system. You just have to adjust the sizing and youre good. Not sure if Amazon uses the same sizing system as zemgear does but you should try using the inchescm measurement instead. Theyre also really fun to run in because youre essentially running the same way you would if youre barefoot. Stepping on big rocks too hard will hurt a lot.,BarefootRunning,cj0br9f,2,t5_2rp0r

3888104,0,t1_cqzdnh5,The entire analysis was done on those two picturesneither of which show the whole motion either player is going through. But from the looks of it Lebron is accelerating so hes on his toes and leaning forward. Whereas Wade is decelerating or changing direction so hes on his heels and leaning back.If they want to make an argument about running form do it on a video. Its like arguing LeBron his a heel striker based on this photo  Furthermore basketball players spend at most  of the game jogging slowly enough to even debate this which neither player was doing in either of those photos. So IMO the forefoot vs heelstriking debate is virtually inconsequential when it comes to player health. ,BarefootRunning,cqzh7a1,4,t5_2rp0r

Its all about strengthening your calves and feet for the forefoot strike while not pushing hard enough to injure yourself.PasteEveryone is different but heres what I did.  I was a runner had some chronic injuries and had just finished a marathon.  Then I got lazy for a year and needed to get running again.I started with lots of barefoot and VFF walking.  A km or two each day then a bit further.  I bought Converse Chucks for my daily casual shoe so no padding or support there too.After a couple of months I went for very short runs alternating between VFFs and barefoot.  I took it REALLY slow and listened to my body a lot and my muscles took a while to adapt.  No injury though and my shinsplints knee pain and hip issues never came back.Eventually I felt my legs change.  One day it felt awkward and then the next it all clicked.  I started running a bit further each day and ramped it up to my previous pace.  This took  or  months total and I probably couldve done it faster but I really didnt want to hurt myself.Good luck and take it slow.   Its worth it ,BarefootRunning,cv7e5mq,3,t5_2rp0r

The weight is a shame as the newer altra Superior . should in theory be perfect!So now I need the impossible of zero drop a little cushion protective for trails but still super super light.

8357953,0,t3_4u2ipm,Just like you shouldnt expect to bench  your first day at the gym you shouldnt expect to run barefoot through the fields right away. Your form is better and your foot strike is softer but youre using a ton of muscles all around your ankles and calves for balance and stability you havent used before.  Keep your volume low to start and youll build strength in those muscles which will increase your stability decrease stress thats causing your soreness and have some seriously ripped calves!,BarefootRunning,d5mao6t,9,t5_2rp0r

8865441,0,t3_51o1p9,The reason why you want to start barefoot is because it somewhat forces you to run with okay form heel stomping gravel doesnt feel very good. With VFFs you dont have that feedback to rely on so you need to make a real conscious effort to use proper form.I assume youve done some reading on what proper form should be but dont be afraid to ask any questions.FWIW I have only seen a needle once while running and I just ran around it. I think its mostly a made up concern. Even if you stepped on it it wouldnt go in unless the needle was pointing upright.,BarefootRunning,d7di2ci,4,t5_2rp0r

If you wore conventional running shoes switching to zero drop can cause some serious stiffness and pain. Here is one video explaining what the problem is and how to address it. Scott adds his own bit of humor to this but its still good information. You dont need to buy his product but it looks like it would work really well. You can use a rolling pin aluminum bottle I found this ideal filled with warm water or a foam roller instead. Foam rollers dont often dig in enough though.
