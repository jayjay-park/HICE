3370478,0,t3_2yr6iu,Seriously people stop downvoting an audiobook just cause you dont like it or just cause its cool to rip on it.  I dont give a fuck about  Shades of Grey but Im happy for anyone who enjoys it and you should be as well.  Nearly every other book on the front page is over  upvoted.    You downvote shit that doesnt contribute anything not stuff you disagree with and dont want others to enjoy.  OP just posted a trilogy in one video yet redditors are actively trying to censor it off the sub by downvoting it the good old I dont like it and neither should you argument.  If you dont contribute anything to this sub AND you downvote legitimate submissions then you are making this a worse place.,audiobooksonyoutube,cpcgjg5,1,t5_2wgo6
