4401298,0,t1_cslk7j9,Crewniverse was the crews Minecraft server. It was a multiplayer mini game server. Fairly similar to lebroncraft the difference being lebroncraft is run by someone outside the group,Crewniverse,cslreca,2,t5_2xx8j

7488013,0,t3_4hxe0s,He annoyed me in HM but he talked sooooo much! Thats why I hated the group call videos because the whole video would just be vikk talking. Which is shame because he used to be my favorite YouTuber some years ago. ,Crewniverse,d2tchpc,8,t5_2xx8j
7613579,0,t1_d3480dy,Yeah I would be all for using rTheCrewYT. No offense to you ukillerconrad but from what Ive seen there are a lot of people on this sub who for whatever reason refuse to even think about using rcrewhub. Its obvious that we need a new subreddit for the Crew. The only downside I can think of is that itll divide this sub with people coming over to the new sub and people staying herenot knowing about the new sub. But after seeing this design again I think it might be for the better.,Crewniverse,d37mhgl,1,t5_2xx8j

8635496,0,t3_4y25mh,I think it might be the video were they were doing TnT races and Speedy turned around to see G rowing the boat down the line of TnT. I dont know which video it is but Shadow had the idea of trapping the wither in a box and tried to kill it with TnT which didnt work.,Crewniverse,d6l1lxh,1,t5_2xx8j

9436002,0,t1_d9c0fp2,Joel outputs a lot of opinion type episodes where he talks about something from his life or give advicesee awkward situations. Even in his other videos like for k or Madden he talks about what is happening to him irl or sometimes just about himself. Videos like these tend to stand out for me because more thought goes into them rather than just ill play for a few hours with my friends tonight and then take  minutes out of it. Even during Crewcraft or Pixelmon Joel would start episodes with a gameplay. I mean hell just watching his Pixelmon series with the editing behind it shows the effort he puts in. I guess what Im saying is Joels videos tend to be refreshing coming from Speedy Hova or Sides videos. Just my two cents.,Crewniverse,d9c2uzj,6,t5_2xx8j
9441551,0,t3_59z7x3,I can go for weeks without watching any crew content and be fine with it kinda sad I used to watch all their videos everyday but something I almost always tend to go back and binge watch are the minecraft series.,Crewniverse,d9cs7p7,5,t5_2xx8j
