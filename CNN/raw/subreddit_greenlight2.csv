That is great but right now its not where I need to be.Yeah good point.gt Id say shared reality is still different for everyone.haha well its shared so its not supposed to be different for everyone. I think what youre saying is that its more about perception and I tend to agree.However if I want to live in a world without war then as a master creator I should be able to create that world....but I havent yet.  And Im not talking about monkeying with the definitions or perceptions of war like Oh you cant stop war in the world but you can stop your personal wars in this world.  NO what Im talking about is stopping all national wars.  I want to live in a world where we dont have any nations warring against other nations.  Thats a clear and unambiguous desire yet Im not able to create that due to some shared reality or something.,greenlight2,d50bahi,1,t5_3bqiz

8522551,0,t3_4vy50l,This is where I get lost in the motives.If masses of people are going to be killed absolutely at anytime by a known few why are the people in the masses who know about this standing around?If the few kill the masses they wont have anything left to play with or a system to exploit.If the few has absolute power and the global  finances why would they need to rob the masses? What is there that the few would take that they cant have delivered to them in minutes or hours?What are the few going to do after this?The absolutism of motives is out of balance with reality. Then again there is no understanding the motives of psychotics.,greenlight2,d66vpdc,2,t5_3bqiz
