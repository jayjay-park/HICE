6410577,0,t1_czib2y8,One of my roommates doesnt talk to me or even acknowledge me but I think its because are shy people. My other roommate I talk to more and seems chill but I havent grown close to them so it could take a while. I want to get an on campus job in the library because I like the quiet environment. Have you worked on campus?,csumb,czibgqk,1,t5_2spwt
