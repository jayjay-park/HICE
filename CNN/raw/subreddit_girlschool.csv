7409663,0,t1_d2i99hi,i started with like tg captions around age  and would fantasize about being fucked by a boy and in the fantasy i would be a girl.. i would trance out really hard it would become like a full on hallucination. similar to hypno kind of..  i started hypno around age like  or so.. i didnt hear the word transgender until i was like twenty.. at that point my head exploded because i realized i wanted to be that so badly i envied the trans women and i wanted to be like them i wanted to get to be a girl. but then i thought what if this is just post hypnotic suggestion?  i struggled for a long time trying to figure out what was or wasnt real because it seemed to me that it was possible i had just hypnotized myself into it all. i went on an intense journey to find myself doing everything in the spiritual  psychoactive cookbook in the process meditating yoga parkour nature walks smoking weed making art poetry for like  years.. i would constantly think about it what would it mean if i was trans and how could i be certain.. i learned alot during this time you cant be certain about anything. you have to trust your intuition over everything and everyone else. do whatever will make you happy. follow your whimsies and wildest dreams. make it happen. just do it. i realized that my entire life i had been envious of girls. the reason i liked what hypnosis was doing was because i wanted to be a girl. i liked it better even if i wasnt concious of that at the time. hypnosis and feminization fetish gave me an outlet through which i could feel feminine and i really didnt have anywhere else i could go for that.. i didnt have the language to feel those feelings through any other mechanism so i felt it through there. im grateful for hypnosis because it made me realize that i wanted the thing i was trying to hypnotize myself to become. the weirdest part is that i wanted to become what i already was which is a trans girl. i secretly knew i was a girl i would tell myself sometimes you are a girl in my head but i would like compartmentalize and reject the thought as delusion or just like random intrusive thoughts but it was there and it was actually not wrong. ive been on hormones for about  months i am more myself than i have ever been in my life. its like someone saved me from a burning building i cant even explain how drastically insanely astronomically better my life is now that i am a girl! im one hundred percent full time name change is in the works totally out of the closet. i have a boy friend sort of.. idk labels are weird and he treats me like a girl and refers to me as she.. estrogen made me look like a girl i basically pass now i have little boobs.. i get giddy everytime i remember im a girl now lt i honestly think anyone that has to ask the question am i trans is trans.. obviously theres an exception to every rule but it seems to be pretty consistent. i would suggest you transition its totally worth it D i went  im afraid ill never get to be a girl. to ive always been the girl and i never was afraidplease listen to your inner girl,girlschool,d2kfi18,4,t5_3bgqe
7426105,0,t3_4g6n4h,I tend to buy a lot of stuff from Yandy. Its usually not super high quality but is very inexpensive. Ive started to develop a keen eye for determining which ones while keep everything in place while also lasting for a while before needing to be replaced. For brick and mortar stores I prefer Fredericks over VS largely because Fredericks has a larger selection of styles I like. Regardless when I get a pair that fits well from either place they do tend to outlast any other brand. ,girlschool,d2mathc,2,t5_3bgqe

9436408,0,t3_59v0rb,One of the big hurdles to overcome for women who transition later in life is a double edged sword.    Ciswomen have to go on a journey in their s when they accept themselves for the older women they are and not the rebellious and youthful girls they were a decade ago.  That does not preclude being sexy but it does mean that the age of giggling and innocent girlishness is over.    Transwomen who transition at  have never gotten the chance to experience a female life at any point before .  This can be traumatizing but still must be worked through in healthy ways  ultimately leading someone to accept themselves for not just their new sex but also their current age.  ,girlschool,d9c4po2,1,t5_3bgqe
