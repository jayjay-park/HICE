3150972,0,t1_cookz9f,Domeless are nice but a little more expensive. Ive used one on my rig before and it is more convenient because you arent restricted by the opening of the dome. Plus I always have to heat the base of my dome to pull it off. Id personally go with domeless but mine works just fine so why change. ,Dabs,coolg3l,2,t5_2th0s

5013514,0,t3_3ji5xj,Dont use a soldering iron. Youll waste the wax and wont get any decent hits or flavor. You want to concentrate the hit. A bong with an enail is the best way to go. ,Dabs,cuqbg9t,2,t5_2th0s

6565465,0,t3_45jf29,Nothing will cover up the crack. You can have it professionally repaired by a good local glass blower. But you wont be able to fool your friend otherwise. ,Dabs,czyf97c,2,t5_2th0s

7587350,0,t3_4j3dg7,Get yourself a honey pen. It works wonders just keep the wick fresh and the oil clean. I honestly think with a fresh wick it can give better vapor hits than a rig,Dabs,d34n7ut,1,t5_2th0s
9084352,0,t3_53o45q,You can use your piece for oil but a couple things to keep in mind are the burnt weed taste that may or may not go away with cleaning and rigs have much more percolation for the most part.Depending on what type of piece you have you might need to buy an adapter but if its a regular  or mm female joint you should have no trouble finding a nail.,Dabs,d83shp0,1,t5_2th0s
9723332,0,t1_dabks8g,Honestly buy a controller and a coil and maybe a nail too or buy one made for flat coils from Auber Instruments under their enail section. Its like  and is just as good as any other enail out there. Except in specific scenarios like needing to run multiple nails at once. Theyre just heaters basically.,Dabs,dabm2x9,1,t5_2th0s

10631954,0,t3_5s58i4,I got the same problem  German shepherds i started taking small plastic container and turning it upside down making a cover for my tools and dab mat. It has helped a ton but unfortunately Ill still come out to random hair clinging to the tool or mat  ,Dabs,ddclsub,3,t5_2th0s

11512801,0,t3_6415ba,I find the oil melts and spreads all over the flat tip and a lot comes off onto my oil rag with the ballpoint most of it melts off the small ball point nearly instantly into the bowl leaving only a little bit of oil on the dabber. I mainly use the Hive dabber for scraping up the last of the oil stuck to my glass container ,Dabs,dg0z7l9,1,t5_2th0s
11722166,0,t1_dgoqh5h,haha I still have my samples they last quite a while I use them for extracts that dont already come packaged in glass or PTFE a lot of legal companies are using precut PTFE now and not parchment so soon we wont have to worry about it,Dabs,dgoqkej,1,t5_2th0s
11726050,0,t1_dgp60p5,Its an ongoing concern with most extracts honestly and at least CO has testing requirements in place that can weed out companies like Mahatma and make people produce safe products unlike in CA where pretty much anything you get is contaminated with pesticides up to  of all CA cannabisextracts are not fit for human consumption and over  have tested positive for Myclobutanil which when pyrolyzedheated turns into Hydrogen Cyanide which is a restricted chemical weapongtMyclobutanil typically sprayed on California grapes almonds and strawberries is legally listed as a general use pesticide but heating up the chemical as is the case when smoking cannabis converts Myclobutanil into Hydrogen Cyanide. Hydrogen Cyanide is a Schedule  substance under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Of paramount concern is the extremely high level of Myclobutanil detected in cannabis samples tested by Steep Hill which is in excess of  of all samples. ,Dabs,dgp6fbx,2,t5_2th0s
