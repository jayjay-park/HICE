Also Godfather bb Zebo was one of my favorite sets in the rain last year. Expect an eclectic crowd and two hours of jukejit at the Detroit stage.,MovementDEMF,cgt15qj,3,t5_2tq8i

3770682,0,t3_33aq3m,Im coming from Canada for Movement and was wondering about this Ive never been to Detroit.We are staying at Hostel Detroit on Vermont amp Spruce and were thinking about renting bikes the whole time. Some questions  Is the area from Hart Plaza to Hostel Detroit safe? Well probably be riding in the early hours in the morning after the festival ends and tofrom afterparties. Is this a good bike route to do so? Were going to the Interface afterparty at the Works. Is it safe to lock up bikes around there or is it better to lock em up at the hostel and walk? Or is it better to taxi everywhere?,MovementDEMF,cqm332u,1,t5_2tq8i

The earlier you buy the more you save too so highly suggest buying early if you know youre going to go.The dirtybird after parties the past couple years have been some of my favorites.  Definitely recommend.  Floor  GA tickets almost always will sell out too.,MovementDEMF,decgks2,3,t5_2tq8i
