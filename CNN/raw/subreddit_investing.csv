I am not an expert in this area but I have considered investing in solarcity and sunpower myself. They handily destroyed the SampP last year with its  gain.Another area of green tech I personally believe will see large future gains is with companies that rely on fossil fuel activity but from a green perspective like water treatment or site remediation. I would recommend going for individual stocks as you never know what a mutual fund will invest in and fees may be high since the green funds are rare right now.Edit  is a good amount of money to get started but I understand in individual stocks you would be somewhat exposed.

Somehow everyone maintains faith in the US dollar despite extreme manipulation but the underlying economy is still unsound so stocks fall while the even lower interest rates increase your bonds value to slightly above par only slightly because they started so low to begin with.So yes your bond might soon be worth more than you paid for it.

If you dont want to follow along skip ahead to the tldr.When were talking about inflation there is a popular view that money growth  inflation. This is not true. The actual equation for inflation looks like thisMV  PyM is your money supply.V is the velocity of money very important in this scenarioP is prices of goodsservicesy  is the quantity of goodsservices sold in a specific time period.Inflation in this equation is analogous to the idea that P prices are going up. Still with me? Ok lets try some numbers.We have a nation  the united states of investopia.Investopia has an economy primarily propane and propane accessories with   goodsservices  y selling for an average price of  P.  Thats  worth of transaction in an given year could be monthday doesnt matter for our example.Now the money supply of investopia is only  M that is to say there only exists  actual investopia buxs.  So where are we..oh yes MV  Pyor   V    A little algebra tells us that V has to be . Or each dollar has to have been used  times in an investopia year how fast its being spent.MVPy      . Now lets introduce a new fed chairman of investopia  uStockJocke . He cranks up the printing pressand prints double the number of investopia bills  instead of  we now have .  V  PyHow do we get inflation? well IF V still remains at  and IF the total number of goodsservices remains at  then P has to increase!     P    PP .The average price of goodsservices has gone from  to  investopia buxs.  Holy shit .. inflation! Buy some guns and ammo now!But wait....hang on a second. Is that the only way to balance the equation? Course not! There are other variables in play. Increase the number of goodsservices branch investopias economy into prostitutes and casinos let say or decrease the rate at which people spend money V..and prices dont have to increase by  if at all!In the best case scenario  the number of goodsservices doubles rises to . Hookers and casinos rush to setup shop in our little utopia.MV  Py      Inflation? Well prices havent budged..inflation is .Alternatively while uStockJocke is printing cash like a baller people might have slowed their spending due to layoffs at Big Propane Co a uwetkarma owned conglomerate. If they slow their spending V again no inflation.  .    .Bottomline  simply increasing the money supply doesnt de facto mean inflation.

I guess that makes sense  the banks and big boys are basically traps where the money gets put away so its as if it didnt actually exist in the context of the entire economy.It sounds like there must be collusion on a massive scale for each organization to willingly do this as one big bank cashing out all at once and putting everything into gold for example could make the whole thing come crashing down.Whos gonna jump ship first?,investing,cfjkxzs,9,t5_2qhhq
374941,0,t1_cfjkva8,Sure. I actually made a post on EUV back on HardOCP a while back when I was studying for a nanofabrication test. Im a senior in chemical engineering graduating with a concentration in Honors and Nanotechnology this semester and Im hoping to do more in the field in grad school. That out of the way Each processor is made out of thousands of mini transistors. These transistors are the basic unit behind all computation in computers. In order to keep processor size the same and increase its performance you simply need to shrink the transistor size so you can fit more of them together. This has resulted in a technology race as long as computers have been around to make smaller and smaller transistors.Todays dominant method is photolithography which basically translates to light rock cut. The idea is if you have a material that changes from soft to hard when exposed to light called a photoresist you can then shine light through a pattern called a mask in order to replicate the pattern of the mask quickly on a surface. This works great but you have to be super careful because now a days processors have features that are patterned on a  nanometer scale and the current photoresist of choice works best with  nm light. Due to the way light works at incredibly small scales several issues come into play when you want to make features smaller then the wavelength of your light. To get to  nm huge lenses ultrapure systems and high index of refraction fluids were used. In order to get to nm Intel had to use a technique called double patterning which essentially means that all the super precise steps you had to do before to make all the layers of a cpu you instead do double. Double the chance for misalignment double the chance for dust to land on the surface double the number of chips you have to throw out. This means you have to be even more careful even more pure. If the entire thing wasnt seismically isolated jackhammering outside the building would be a real issue. All of this technology means that cpu production is incredibly expensive and can only be done in special facilities called fabs short for fabrication or foundries. There is no way they could go to quadruple patterning moving forward and so some new technique had to be discovered. Currently the focus is on EUV but Ill explain them all a bitEUV is the same as traditional photolithography but it uses a different wavelength laser . nm vs  nm that is in the Extreme Ultra Violet range of the spectrum thus EUV. The problem is that everything absorbs EUV. The traditional lenses used for  nm absorb it the traditional masks weve used even air absorbs it. So basically EUV has been a clusterfuck to implement but were getting a lot closer now. We have new lenses we vacuum out the lens stack we have the whole setup. The biggest issue remaining is power. Remember the way we transfer patterns with photolithography is you shine light through a cut out. The light lands on a surface and makes some of the surface become hard or soft. The soft surface is washed off and now you are left with a nice mold to add whatever you want. The issue is how much light does it take for the surface to change? Remember the average chip might have dozens of layers. If each layer takes even an hour it is simply way too long. For this reason you want to use high intensity light so that you keep the times low. The issue with our EUV setups so far is that they simply arent intense enough to pattern a wafer quick enough for it to be economical. Ideally you want to be able to measure the time in minutes and we just arent there yet. A few other technologies that are so called up and comers are techniques such as EBeam nanoimprint and self assembly. Ill give a basic run down and you can ask questions after.EBeam is the most relatable to photolithography. If shrinking the wavelength of light gives you a way to make smaller features why not use electrons instead? Electrons have incredibly small wavelengths. The issue is that if you imagine a light as small as say your laser pointer. It puts out thousands of light particles at a time in a nice blanket layer. Electrons on the other hand can be made in individual beams but since electrons have a negative charge and like charges repel you cant just have a coherent blanket of electrons. Thus you have to literally go electron by electron to fill up the whole wafer which takes FOREVER. Like Im talking you want to do one layer a cm by a cm you better leave it overnight and god help you if someone across the block decides to tear up their driveway because youre screwed. To counter this they just use fancy lenses to do thousands of beams at once but it still is too slow and brings a new issue. Each beam of electrons carries negative charges. If you want to precisely aim the electrons at the surface with nm precision you need to account for the charge of each other beam and their repulsion when you pattern the surface. You have k beams then you have to account for k interactions for each beam for each step. If I remember correctly the data requirements were in the terabits for each beam. Simply getting the calculations done and the data sent to the machine to control all the parts is an incredibly expensive task.So next up is nanoimprint. Imagine you have a see through glass stamp with your features in it. You simply stamp down on the wafer and the photoresist on the surface is now only where the grooves in the stamp are. Simply shine a light through the stamp all at once and tada. Perfect layer. Of course youre aiming for features below  nm. If you get even the smallest contaminant on your stamp maybe a few atoms get transferred from the stamp to the photoresist on the wafer the stamp is gone. Now you need to make a new stamp. Btw the stamps are made almost atom by atom and cost well over k. So try not to press too hard. Super cool technique if they get mask destruction figured out because you do the whole wafer at once and you can get atomic resolution because you can take weeks to make the perfect mask. Some groups have tried adding a release lubricant to the stamp which helps some but again not close yet.Last but not least self assembly. This is tricky. If you want to make a house all you need is some square shaped molecule with a female plug at the top and a triangle molecule with a male plug at the bottom. Mix them up and you will get a triangle on a square or a house and you only need one pair of binding sites. If you want to do this for an entire processor with say thousands of unique patterns you need thousands of unique binding sites. You then need to construct all the molecules with the proper binding sites. They have some cool stuff with DNA done smiley faces and the like but nothing to the level of complexity of chips.Anyways Ask away if you want more detail.

378694,0,t1_cfjqram,you are incorrect sir it seems u do not fully understand what inflation is. inflation doesnt affect all asset classes at the same time at the same rate. asset price inflation can lead to consumer price inflation can lead to wage inflation. rising asset prices for examplereal estatestockartcollectables is inflation. what about healthcare college tuition are you going  tell me theres no inflation in these industries? the industries that become most inflated are the ones that see the most money directed towards them usually goes hand in hand with government involvement promoting the malinvestment money directed by gov guarantees through FHA FannieMae Freddie Mac inflated housing prices in  government guarantees of student loans gave students unlimited access to credit to created our current student loan bubble and drove the cost of tuition through the roof.  if the foreign governments and citizens where to start selling their dollars in exchange for American products assets property stocks bonds it would cause serious asset amp price inflation. trillions of dollars that are sitting idle in overseas reserves now would suddenly be circulating over here in the U.S chasing an even lower amount of goods and services bc less foreign imports. The velocity of money would then be very high because the inflation declining value of dollars would pose a great incentive to divest oneself of them less demand for dollarslower value. recession increases the risk of inflation down the line because businesses close leading to less production governments spend themselves into overindebtedness and central banks attempt to print their way out monetize debt to devalue the currency thereby devaluing the outstanding debts leading to more dollars chasing less supply. look at the Zimbabwean or Argentinian examples before you talk about capacity utilization and output gap. both cases the economy was in recession but inflation soared into hyperinflation. ,investing,cfk0mne,-1,t5_2qhhq

416046,0,t3_1yuaum,ELI The stock generally is diluted and typically the stock price falls after a secondary offering. This is the generic secondary public offering. An owner could also sell out of their share and decrease their position which would also be a considered secondary offering. Stock would typically react negatively to this too.More information The secondary offering is usually allocated to institutional investors and they basically agree on a mutual price with the investment bank underwriting the issuance. I think of it this way. Textbook definition  more shares leads to lower EPS leads to lower PE multiple andor splitting profit with more equity owners . More abstract way of thinking  reprices the existing equity. It is what shareholders are willing to pay for the company once they are offered the chance to.Yes the money raised is typically reinvested in the business but the dilutive nature typically offsets the reinvestment. Just to clarify it is not a hard and fast rule that equity falls in a secondary. Here are some examples switch to M or M viewNMM  This is a more typical secondary offering Event E.

That means that if you just randomly distributed your money among the  largest companies you have a pretty good chance of doing just as well as the smartest investing teams with access to reams of research that the average investor doesnt have access to.  If ANYONE should beat the market it would be these guys.  And they typically dont.  You want to impress your parents think about investing in indexes.  The other thing to think about is when you are trading you have to pay a commission to your broker.  You want to buy  worth of some stock you pay the broker  to do it.  That means you are  down right out of the gate.  You have to make  on that trade JUST TO BREAK EVEN!Now I have nothing to gain from any investment you make but look at what the fees are if you invest in something like the Vanguard SampP index fund.

I can spend Bitcoins quickly without setting up an account with a vendor giving them personal information or involving a third party transaction processor who gets to learn about my buying habits. One of the more idealistic attractions is a currency for which the supply cant be trivially manipulated by governments. Obviously its value is quite unstable at the moment and probably vulnerable to manipulation but if it is able to mature and stabilize it could be a significant revolution in how we think about currencies. As an investment I think this sentiment is generally right. Early adopters made off like bandits and there are a lot of people buying it and speculating on it based on its perceived growth potential.

What do you think Wall Street was doing before? Emptying their pockets to give you the best possible price?HFT bellyachers come in three categories Wall Street old school types who are upset that computers are frontrunning their strategies. But HFTs are doing the same strategies as the old school fatcat traders but faster and cheaper. I suspect this is why so much of the finance establishment is against HFT. People who dont understand exchange trading. Michael Lewis is a smart guy but money and fame are powerful incentives to not understand things. People who think HFT is helpful but also an inefficient arms race in which HFTers fight each other. This includes some big name HFT companies viz. Getco who want to make more money by not having to buy so many fast computers. To accomplish this and make it available to the public will probably require an overhaul of SEC regulations.

So you start buying the tickets.  By the time youve bought the second ticket the price for the third and fourth seat have doubled.  You try instead to buy from a different set of  seats together and again by the time youve completed the purchase for  seats the price has increased on seats  and  to much more than it was when you started.What is happening is the mere act of purchasing was increasing the price because a HFT can see your intentions infer that youre going to buy more seats the HFT then buys ahead of you and it can always buy faster than you then offers seats  and  back to you and double what it paid.

The other category is bonds but we have been in a year bull market for bonds and treasury rates are currently historically low.

721755,0,t3_22f6qn,One good angle to explore the implications of any assertion is to ask yourself Under which situation of carefully considered planning would this assertion if true affect the course of action chosen?For example someone claims crossing the road except at a designated crossing is illegal. If this is true then when would it affect the course of action chosen? In a great number of situations! Every time you would think about crossing the road apart from at a crossing it would be relevant.That doesnt mean that its true but it does mean that its interesting.This assertion is not interesting. Because even if it is true theres pretty much no situation when it changes what you should be done. We have had something like  years of varied economic growth to date  and if it is true that we e.g. cannot grow beyond  years from today then absolutely nothing changes. You would not do anything differently.Im deliberately pointing out the extended timespan because thats another angle from which its not an interesting assertion  its impossibly ambiguous. What does it even mean? Because I would agree that the various theories of physics appear on my layman interpretation to point to the inevitable death of the universe  and if you were to make an argument that growth is very much possible over the next X years he could just extend it to say that doesnt apply over the next XY years. If he had put a natural cap on the extension limits in his argument we cannot have continuous economic growth beyond the year  then it would be interesting but when its so openended you would just find him dodging down the corridor he built for himself if you tried pinning him down.Hence Not interesting not worth having a discussion with.edit oh and some other flaws if there is a cap on how much we can grow we can by definition grow all the way there. From that point depreciation of assets still work and replacing those assets takes investment. And people would still invest even if growth wasnt possible as long as growth seemed to them to be possible.,investing,cgmbf2g,1,t5_2qhhq

Additionally returns after  years in the bull market are some of the worst and most unreliable of any period in a bull market.

953167,0,t3_2511z6,Discussion?Its weird to me that individuals will jump on what is traditionally a lagging indicator for signs of a Chinese bubble pop. You need something more immediately obvious and a means of measuring that the Chinese government cant easily skew to get a real picture of the Chinese economy.Personally I prefer to review their energy consumption because  of their electrical consumption is industrial in nature. If their industry was suddenly hit youd see energy consumption drop off almost immediately.For open source information... The EIA provides these numbers. Theyre only good through Feb of this year at the moment. If you want another measure we know that ironore imports also hit a record this month for China. That ore is being converted into steel for industrial purposes. You arent importing a record amount of ore if youre hurting as an industry.We can observe these numbers and make a reasonable guess that because Chinese consumption of energy in Q is . higher than last year that theyre probably healthy in relative terms. China has structural issues in its housing market but I think its a bit overblown because everybody is waiting for an equivalent of  to nail China. It may never come. They have a glut of space but the government technically owns all of those properties. You are only buying the right to lease that apartment. A lot of the market speculation comes from a capitalistic view and these pieces seem to ignore the fact that China is communist. Capitalist market fundamentals do not necessarily apply there. Just as with US government property those buildings can sit empty for years without a real purpose. ,investing,chcmsyn,10,t5_2qhhq

If that is the case then dont you have to worry about cycling your money such that you have enough aside to go through the T time period this is coming from a US perspective btw?For example suppose you have  in an account. A good faith violation occurs when you sell a position on which the funds for it have not cleared a T time period. In that case do you essentially split your money in thirds and work with a third of your money each day to ensure that the money you buy and sell with on that day doesnt trigger the violation?I am more of a longterm investor or at least a once a week sorta deal but Ive always wondered how the whole daytrading shindig works out for people.,investing,chv1cob,2,t5_2qhhq

1156582,0,t1_chzghgr,Yep youre right in a capitalist society however at least you have the choice to be exploited.  For example you want a car so you go to a bank and ask for a loan a creditor gives it to you when you agree to pay it back with interest.  This is exploitation by definition but is the result of free choice.  If you decide you dont like the exploitation you can stop paying and lose the car or quit your job all free choices. However in communist societies you are exploited involuntarily.  For example if you want a house sorry no dice property belongs to the state.   Yet you still have to work.   Do you like your job? Nope? Well you cant quit because the state needs you.  You will work and if you dont you will be imprisoned or worse.

1261957,0,t3_28jppl,gt money is not vestedI wonder what you mean by that.  The normal meaning would be if you change jobs now you lose that money.  But I dont think that is what you mean.For a small amount of money you generally want most to avoid fees.  For a very small amount you may not have the choice to leave it in the K.  You may be forced to either roll it over to an IRA or pay tax and penalty for withdrawing.Moving to an IRA gives you a wider choice of ETFs instead of mutual funds so likely lower expense ratio though ETF may leave a faction of a share worth in cash so mutual fund might be better for tiny total.  Make sure you understand all fees before opening an IRA.  Fees can eat up a small account.Switching to Roth is probably a good idea.  The details involve a moderate amount of guessing the future and depend on many aspects of your personal financial situation.  But typically it is best to have as large a fraction of retirement money as possible Roth while you are young and switch to contributing to non Roth K when you are older so you retire with a mix mainly non Roth and only a small part Roth but that Roth part went in first.,investing,cibl3me,6,t5_2qhhq

1380948,0,t1_cipbrh9,To your editlast paragraphAgain I totally agree that we need to look at many different indicators and take into account their strengths and weaknesses. For example the Shillercyclically adjusted PE ratio works best when it is in a normal cycle... but currently it includes the second worst earnings environment in the past century. This will throw off the Schiller by some amount that is probably impossible to calculate but is somewhat higher than it should be. The truth is probably somewhere between the different metrics and this post gives  of them which currently rest in the th to th historical percentile with anything above  having very low but still positive returns.We should also take into account the low interest rates as presented in this article as well as the fact that earnings and margins are historically high but partially because of globalization which will give them a boost compared to historical comparisons. Based on all of that and not the ridiculous year cycle theory it doesnt seem like a bubble or time to worry but is an indicator to watch PE ratios as interest rates start to rise with the understanding that it could be a problem if they dont begin to fall in accordance.,investing,cipdwuv,1,t5_2qhhq

Second when you short futures you need to deposit cash to your margin account to meet the initial margin requirement. However this is not a cost. When you buy a put option then you have to pay the option premium. Third which return is higher? It depends on the strike price you choose. If you buy OTM put and it becomes ITM at expiration then the return will much higher than futures. But the bidask spread of OTM option is very large because of small open interest. ,investing,ciyndhq,1,t5_2qhhq

The fact that the stock market continues to rise proves that it is in a bubble and that quantitative easing is the only thing left holding it up. When that goes away in October there will be nothing but free fall. At no time in history have the signals for a collapse been more clear and anyone who denies them now must be either a paid shill or simply delusional. Buy some gold or a safe from our sidebar because the crunch which is already in progress will make the financial crisis look like a cakewalk.B While the numbers released by the government technically show growth for the first half of the year we find it extremely suspicious that they included insert random totally unsuspicious wonky data thing which provides just enough of a boost to keep the first half GDP positive. As we predicted in our  article they have found a way to fudge the numbers just enough to eek out barely positive growth and avoid the technical definition of a recession despite the now obvious reality that the imminent collapse of the U.S. which we have been predicting since  is finally here. The now undeniable fact that they would go to such lengths as faking the GDP data prove the plutocrats know that quantitative easing has failed and that the great collapse has begun. This graph of investments in gold can be misinterpreted to suggest that they have already started stashing their loot to protect it from the imminent collapse even as they desperately try to convince the sheeple that nothing is wrong. Buy some gold or a safe from our sidebar because the crunch which is already in progress will make the financial crisis look like a cakewalk.I feel like by this point I could write a script that could produce Zero Hedge prediction articles and then follow them up to prove how right those predictions were just based on keywords in the news.,investing,cj8tlyh,7,t5_2qhhq

This is reflected in the discount rate of stocks which increases as the riskfree rate increases thereby lowering the value of the stock. This is the relationship Im talking about.

1759880,0,t1_ck0ypmd,Sorry I originally replied to the wrong post.First not all of these routes will add to SW revenue. For example the company has just started MCOMBJ NAS and AUA. However the airline flew these all of routes under AirTran when Southwest had already purchased AirTran. This isnt new revenue its just being operated by a different branch of the company now that AirTran is on the way out. In other words this increase in revenue was factored in years ago when Southwest merged with AirTran.Second as I stated in my previous response this is hardly enough growth to allow the stock to appreciate materially. The destinations ex Mexico City are predominantly lowyield and will not add substantially to the bottom line. If they start moving into more higher yield cities like PortauPrince then I might start paying attention. Even then I think their NA international growth opportunities are limited.

The people here who think this is the way insider trading is done dont know what they are talking about.The plays that are worth a lot are the foreknowledge that a company is about be to acquired and big deals e.g. big construction deals that will change a companys outlook for years to come. When it is announced that a company will be acquired its stock usually rises tens of percentage points in one day. Now the CEO is not stupid enough to trade his own company stock because this will get noticed. Well in  of the cases he is not stupid enough. Instead he tips off his buddies at the golf course and country club. They then go off and make the big bucks. Those things are virtually impossible to prove so there is zero chance of getting caught. His buddies will of course return him the favor when things are happening in their own companies and again it is hard to prove anything since nobody is buying and selling the stock of their own company.,investing,ck6gz53,13,t5_2qhhq

1814365,0,t3_2fa2jk,I think the D printing industry as a whole in terms of equipment manufacturers is overvalued. The industry is certainly still very hyped up especially in the consumer field. However where additive manufacturing will really be revolutionary is in the industrial sector. If you dig a little deeper the most expensive industrial printers are made for use in manufacturing metals due to the cost savings that can be realized aerospace parts. Currently there is very little standardization and repeatability  example you could metal print  parts and there could be slight deviations in every part due to numerous parameters and factors that must be accounted for in the process. The only company addressing this problem in detail is SGLB. They are currently developing a software that would take realtime measurements and adjust parameters accordingly in a nondestructive closedfeedback loop system. I dont see the additive industry moving forward without such a system in place and therefore Ive invested in SGLB. However it is a penny stock so the risk is extremely high. But of course do your own due diligence and come to your own conclusions before you buy. ,investing,ck7t8z4,2,t5_2qhhq

It takes a tremendous amount of capital and return just to beat the fact that a  fee is automatically tacked to assets you are acquiring.  If you are investing  that  fee automatically puts you at  return compared to commision free etf. It goes down at  to about . return but still you havent gotten to diversification yet or a risk adverse portfolio.

1850009,0,t1_ckc0p4a,Disclaimer I do not fully believe in all of the following statements but it is the best advice for you right nowWhat you should do is find an easy portfolio such as the fund portfolio found here  If you try to do much more beyond this you are likely to get worse returns.  Dividends are great really but when you are dealing with a retirement account you should aim for the best return possible within your risk appetite.  With something such as  portfolio found in the link provided you are taking yourself out of the equation which is the bets thing for you to do.  If you try to pick certain funds or try to get slightly better returns odds are you are going to do worse not only because you chase past performance which is no guarantee of future results but you are also likely to start trying to put your money in and out of the funds when you think the market is going updown.  Doing either of these are highly likely to ruin your returns so by taking yourself out of the picture and simply following such a simple setup you will get good returns and you are much less likely to be your own worst enemy.,investing,ckc4e7p,1,t5_2qhhq

Whether they are actually plotted on a chart is a lesser point.RegressionUsing relationships between two historical sets of data to determine if something is mispriced.  Perhaps using that relationship in a spread would hedge away extraneous influences.   A lot needs to be considered with this one as correlated sets can become uncorrelated for natural reasonsnews regulations etc.Meanreversion and momentumThe market is a system and systems have rules and actors that have tendencies.  There are too many indicators to count but they generally try and address the parts of the system that dont operate like a random walk.FundamentalsSome people use volume at price volatility open interest perhaps storage or imports with derivatives that can give you a statistical probability of some future price or movement.So my question is as follows.  If any one of the types of approaches above has merit then you would agree that some lines could have a benefit.  My question is how can you be sure that gt Anytime you try to make a prediction from lines on a chart I will automatically discredit you as someone who knows what they are talking about.I have been looking for those reasonings and I was wondering if it fell into the random walk category or if there are other arguments I have not heard.

1862918,0,t1_ckdltdd,Steve Jobs held the serious but rarely spoken reservation about Tim Cook in that Cook is not a product guy per se. Jobs is quoted this in his official biography Steve Jobs page .  In the same book Jobs makes it clear repeatedly that the future of Apple depends entirely on the quality of its products.  That Jobs chose and that his board approved someone who is not a product guy to lead Apple is a huge redflag for me.  Cook is a Six Sigma guy not a design innovator and certainly not a cult leader like Jobs was.  He or someone like him would have to be both to keep the cult following of Apple intrigued.  There is only so much that expensive behindthescenes talent can do for you before it fails as a substitute for the genius of Steve Jobs. The Apple Watch doesnt strike me as a bigseller.  Personally I believe the Apple Watch to be a simple vanityproject by Tim Cook he goes to the gym a lot probably hates carrying his phone with him as he works out so he forced an iWatch product that he incorrectly thinks will sell.Edit  Not very analytical but hilarious nonetheless this is the top post on rfunny right now with  votes.,investing,ckdocs6,-5,t5_2qhhq

It has since traded up to  and thats pretty much fair value at this point. Remember that YHOO is selling a BIG chunk of its BABA position at the  IPO price so  wont affect that portion of its BABA investment. At this point BABA would need to rally up to  for investors to start jumping on YHOO as an alternative investment to BABA. The trouble with YHOO is that theres no idea how it will grow from this point on except for the BABA investment and we all know that will come to an end at some point.The big sell off in YHOO the past two days are from investors who bought shares at  solely on BABAs valuation and are now locking in gains. After all If I bought at  last year Id be selling today at  too for a  gain I held back month options on YHOO when it was at  to about  in June so I locked in gains earlier.

2021695,0,t1_ckws92s,Ive seen very few gas stations that give a cash discount but those particular rewards levels are if you have multiple cards all no annual fee. For example with the BOA in conjunction with an Amex you get  on gas and groceries both. There are several  on travel cards and others that give you up to  rewards on rotating categories its a pain to keep track but worth it when its  back on things like home improvement or restaurants. I agree that widespread discounts are unlikely except in the lowest margin business gas and cant imagine that they would be more popular with Bitcoin if they arent already with cash with already is easily accessible and widely used.My main point is that as Bitcoins inflation block reward drops it puts future upward pressure on transaction fees while credit companies have significant room to drop theirs if they had to by reducing cash back rewards. Yes I am aware of the many possible ways this could play out for Bitcoin and it is not a solved problem. I do know the most popular and easiest way to solve it is just go to centralized offchain transactions which provide zero benefits over CCs at all.At the same time even if the market does like current features of bitcoin irreversible push based transactions and lower merchant fees they could be easily be adopted and copied by CC companies themselves. They could issue special no fraud protection cards with Apple Pay style one time numbers that make push based irreversible transactions. Doing that would cost almost nothing and could easily compete on fees. The only uncopyable benefit that Bitcoin provides is that a company doesnt get your purchasing records and I guess maybe if you dont like the termslaws surrounding credit card repayments. Those are not particularly special benefits because few people have trouble trusting CC companies and dont mind if their transaction data is collected.,investing,ckwt76v,1,t5_2qhhq

2033064,0,t3_2hxyih,A risk premium is just the excess risk associated with a particular object compared to a benchmark risk in most cases this benchmark is the risk in a riskfree asset like Treasury bonds. It is sometimes incorporated into a risk indicator called beta. For instance lets say the risk of default of  year Treasury bonds by the government is . The SampP might have a risk premium of  while the bonds of a large company might have a risk premium of   indicating that there is an added risk to holding these two compared to the Treasury bond. Based on this banks can assign a suitable return commensurate to the risk which holders have to bear. Risk premium of a futures position is much the same its just the excess risk premium of holding onto a futures position  which my guess is likely quite high. Whats the context? Without it theres not much to draw from it except give you the definition. ,investing,cky8wfv,3,t5_2qhhq

SO lets say you buy a stock with  dollars and then you sell it in an hour for . you now have  dollars of unsettled funds what does unsettled mean? im not sure exactly something to do with the money going between bankssystems. With unsettled funds you are somewhat limited. You can buy a stock with unsettled funds but you CANNOT sell until those funds are settled. Well actually you can but it is called a free ride basically you are using money that you dont actually have yet. Funds usually take  days to settle. If you do not wait the  days for the funds to settle you have then just had a free ride. The first offense is a slap on the wrist. Your brokerage will call you up and say hey man stop doing that. The second offense usually will not let you buy stocks with unsettled funds. an example of a free ride would be as follows. Buy a stock with  sell it in an hour for . Then Buy another stock with that unsettled Then sell that in an hour for whatever value. If you had waited  days to sell that stock than you would be fine. edit There are things called margin accounts which allow you to do this but they require minimum balance in your acct and such. ,investing,ckyg0q3,3,t5_2qhhq

If you are  in the market through stocks bonds or whatever you are in then you have no free money that lays unimpacted by the bear market so you cant get a good deal on stock.So telling me that cash has negative return is fucking stupid.

Its like this We know that malaria will say kill  people a day not a real stat every day for the rest of eternity. We know that ebola kills  people a day right now with the possibility that this time next year it could be killing  people a day.Which one poses a bigger threat? Obviously ebola. Ebola could actually stop commerce. Malaria wont because it hasnt already and nothing has changed.   . We have no idea how ebola could affect second world countries. Sanitation sucks in Southeast Asia. If it spread to India I definitely could see it growing fast there. Same with rural regions in China Thailand Bangladesh and other countries.   . Say whatever you want about how a total of  people in history have died in America because of malaria but its not a big deal here. Actually its not an issue at all. The chance of you getting struck by lightning while being eaten by a shark is probably fucking higher than getting malaria and that minuscule chance reduces a whole lot more if you never visit a place affected by malaria eg. bumfuck regions in Africa and SE asia.,investing,ckym56k,1,t5_2qhhq

You are the one who made the false assumption from the perspective of the random person the internet company stating this is not a guarantee that you will have at least  MBps is the same as the financial adviser stating Past performance does not guarantee future results.With the internet the understanding is that I may sometimes go over MBps I may sometimes go a little under but generally speaking I am paying for MBps and I will have about that much almost all of the time.  With the financial adviser it is the same thought My account may sometimes have a little more gains than this maybe a little less but generally speaking this is about what I get.  How the hell is a random person reading both of these statements supposed to know that when the internet company makes the claim they do mean that the average matches past performance but when the financial states it they actually means this number has absolutely no relation whatsoever to anything which you are paying for.  The contracts read the same and yet the services rendered in one case match what is claimed and in the other the services have zero relation to what is claimed.You and I are lucky enough to have spent time researching this topic.  You have gone above and beyond me you actually understand contracts and obligations from a legal standpoint I merely try to understand individual words.  Tell me how you can expect a random person with no prior contract understanding and with no investment knowledge to know that when the utility states this is no guarantee they mean it as this is the average if it sometimes goes lower please understand that it happens but the financial saying this is no guarantee means This has absolutely nothing to do with what you should reasonably expect.,investing,cl45gqm,2,t5_2qhhq

2090360,0,t3_2ish25,ELI Its about how you expect to profit not what youre doing.Investing To expect to profit via the underlying business of the sharecompany. e.g. Apple Pay is expected to increase revenues by  every year and this will be reflected in capital appreciation of the share price.Trading To expect to profit via moving inventory regardless of their underlying business. e.g. Ryan takes stock of AAPL shares temporarily and expertly releases inventory when the price increases slightly in much the same way his friend Paula buys and sells golf balls at her hardware shop.Speculating a subset of Trading on the higher spectrum of risk. Whether the profits ultimately rely on news from the underlying business is irrelevant the principle is still about profiting from moving inventory not profiting from the underlying business.e.g. Randy thinks that GTAT is about to secure a deal with Apple and wants to take inventory of GTAT shares so that he can flip them when their price increases. Alternatively Jennifer observes  day moving averages and takes stock of F shares so she can flip them later.Gambling To expect to profit on emotions rather than logic i.e. luckchance.e.g. Simon feels that P shares are gonna blow on rumors that his banker friend of a friend told his nieces friend. He goes allin on call options and ends up bankrupt.I hope this ELI draws the boundaries clearly for you.

For people who would panic and sell if they lost a ton they should cut their current equity exposure somewhat and add cash or bonds to avoid selling far lower than we are now.

Theres no way around this issue they have to market to their user base to make money. Linked In has no such problem because their main current and projected future revenue stream comes from people other than their regular users.For companies that are growing quickly valuation can be estimated on the basis of the size of the market they are pursuing. According to an article I linked elsewhere here recruiting is a  billion industry. If they own that industry when theyre done growing they should be able to capture  of those revenues if not more. That would give them  billion in revenues annually. Then you could apply whatever profit margin you prefer together with an assumed PE ratio to get a future market capitalization for the firm. A future PE of  and a profit margin of  would imply a future market capitalization of  billion. This is ten times their current worth  billion market cap.

Index Funds including ETFs may lag behind active funds in years where the stock market goes up huge numbers.  But when the stock market doesnt go up very much or even starts to go down actively managed mutual funds are very quick to lose money. Everyone has been making money the last few years and its easy for your average investor to think they can beat the system because the last few years have been great. You said youve been managing your own Roth IRA for the last two years.  Thats great but the last two years has shown over  growth.  Dont be fooled because the last two years have been good.Passive Index Funds will beat an Active Mutual Fund in the long term.  This includes both good and bad years combined.

2336683,0,t3_2m358e,Just my opinion For me the best thing I always try look at with MOST traditional cases of investing is the statement of cash flows in a company. They are so easy to find and over the years I have found a strong correlation with good cash flows and a stocks performance being pretty solid. Theres a ratio that some companies give but you should mostly do on your own. Its called the Price to Cashflow ratio Share priceCash Flow Per Share. A good one is normally in single digits. However I also want to point out that companies include depreciation and amortization in their cash flows tax deductibles indirect cash inflow which may  make the number look better then it really is. I recommend just glancing at the depreciation on the balance sheet to make sure its reasonable. Of course this doesnt work in all cases. For example Twitter basically had non existent cash flow and can still be seen as a great investment based solely on perceived value. Again this is just my opinion Ive always felt that to make investing less complicated sometimes its just easy to boil it down to the basics cash is always a positive sign of a business.And another exception is if companys use something called the Baumol Cash management model which you can google.For a quick and dirty on the aforementioned ratio check this outAgain I cannot stress enough this is just my opinion for SAFE investing if you are seeking speculation or more risk this doesnt necessarily apply. Also there are countless exceptions. Hope this helps.,investing,cm0iyzq,5,t5_2qhhq

2483507,0,t1_cmiq316,No its not. If the market has gone up in value due to wealth being created over the past two hundred or so years then its not a zero sum game.You can see here that the returns are not distributed normally and that the mean return is positive for the SampP for instance.If you randomly invested in a new SampP stock every day and sold at the end of the day bought a different random one the next sold etc. from the years  you would very likely be at a positive value because the major tendency of stocks in the SampP through those years is to go up.And no. If a fund manager underperforms the SampP then maybe they only make  that year instead of . Theres no way to make a riskless profit off of that. If you shorted it youd still lose money.Consider really learning how the market works at a simple simple level and youll understand that the average investor that invests randomly with no commission should win maybe . of the time random number close to  in a normal bull market and that people who are losers are losers because of commission not because they are great at actively picking losers.,investing,cmiqdxx,2,t5_2qhhq

2556181,0,t3_2ozvu4,The math can be much simpler.  on the mortgage vs. the stated  in the market.The real issue at hand is the risk. There is no risk in paying off your mortgage faster. None period. There is however risk in investing in the market. Yes history says you can make a certain percentage in the long run but that doesnt mean its guaranteed. This is why this equation and equating paying off debt risk free to investing will never be apples to apples.Our household follows this easy guide. I double the amount of principle paid with each mortgage payment. This cuts my repayment time in half and early on that number is smaller. So I still get the tax incentive while the getting is good I can invest more earlier on and let the time horizon take care of the rest and I am building more equity in my house earlier on which protects against having an asset that is harder to liquidate should ratesinflationany number of catalysts here negatively affect real estate while my equity is still kind of low.The only problem you can run into is that you dont get credit for prepayments so if you prepay all to hell and your financial situation changes you can still default or go into foreclosure in the same amount of time. If you invest the money and havent lost it then you have something to liquidate to keep the mortgage payments going. This is why I like to prepay in incrementally larger amounts by doubling principle as my savingsinvestments increase as well.Its all about how well you sleep at night!,investing,cms8auy,2,t5_2qhhq

E.g. elderly woman with a large pension who wants to invest for her grandchildren would be better served in a larger stock allocation as those children have decades of time to go. Conversely a young  year old might suddenly lose job get disabled etc. In addition Graham argues a  allocation in bonds will give the investor a cushion and courage during times when their stocks are taking a beating and Graham frequently argues that the investors greatest weakness is himself with regard to discipline. ,investing,cn7xv5d,1,t5_2qhhq

This is unique and patented by Vanguard and I believe it applies to all Vanguard funds that have both a mutual fund and ETF version. Many Vanguard mutual funds havent had a taxable event in years besides the dividend payouts which are usually qualified dividends that are taxed at your longterm capital gains rate anywaysTo answer your question just buy some total stock market index funds. The same ones that you already hold in your retirement accounts except you buy the individual fund itself and not a  fund. You could also consider buying into the Vanguard extended market index which is  the same as the total stock market except the SampP  stocks are removed from it. This gives you more exposure to small and mid caps. Stay away from individual stocks unless you want subpar returns and unfavorable taxation.

He started off with a k piece of land sold it put the same investment plus profit into a new piece of land rinse and repeat a few times. He turned that k into a k piece of waterfront property and a k lake house  blocks from the water. All in  years. They also purchased their current home for k and it is now worth about k. He saw the growth in the area and bought cheap early on. Find the right opportunity for profit and go for it. I did  of my research online looking for whatever I could. Whats the lowest down payment I would need? FHA is .. Is there any way to get assistance with that .? My bank offered a  grant. What if I lose my job? My bank will cover up to  months of my mortgage if I lose my job. I like this home whats the value history? Original price k sold in  for k foreclosed and for sale at k. Whats the market like? Piss poor buyers dream  buy low sell high. Yes this is a home but its an investment first. Dont buy with emotion buy with logic. Think about the future of your home as an investment. I can see that the market is artificially inflated home prices have come back up a lot starting to slow and there are a hell of a lot of foreclosed properties not on the market. For me and what I see it looks like a peak. Ill sell rent for  months   year then buy again. Either the market will tank again by then or it will remain steady either way Im financially ready. My city is growing so I will buy on the outskirts where people are moving to to get away from all the noise. That market stayed relatively stable so its a safe investment with potentially huge rewards. No growth out from the city minor gains from the investment. Decent growth huge gains. Research your area talk to friends in bankingreal estate and try to guess what the market will do. I was in no position to buy our home. We had k in savings.

There is risk involved hardly and at the end of the year I can check my account and see a return hopefully. Investments to me are longer term. If I have a k Im investing for the long term. Its not a savings account and I cant withdraw money from it. If I buy rental property Im investing in an asset in hopes that it produces cash flow over time.

Its going to become a mess. Telecoms and tech company stocks are going to bounce all over the place.Edit I foresee the above setting back large data internet services by a decade. We will eventually see unlimited data return to home connections thanks to competition  but not for a very long time. ISPs will collectively drag their feet when it comes to stepping up monthly data allowances. Their entire business model will cause them to benefit most by setting data allowances just below average usage so their customers regularly incur overage charges.As a dev Im also afraid of data usage lawsuits. If your product or service causes your users to consume large amounts of data example a bug in an update causes your app to go data hog wild and incur data overage you as the Dev may be held liable. Thats a compete nightmare.,investing,cnn27ew,2,t5_2qhhq

In fact I allocated  toward the SPY I rather own the ETF than an indextracking mutual fund for liquidity and other reasons.Given his age my view is that he should be in growth oriented funds to maximize accumulation. Index funds do not do that. For example the major indices are typically long a lot of energy names and I would not put my worst enemies in energy stocks right now.

2836810,0,t3_2sk2cl,Heres the answer dont sell any of those stocks. I have a pretty close portfolio to that company wise and I think the hot stocks for long lasting companies are sometimes the best to invest in. Simply keep what you have and wait on it. Negative bias shows that we feel loss x more than gains emotionally. Suck it up and just wait it will ALL break even and then have the balls to wait even more.  most of those stocks will break even within the next year so set it aside or buy more just have patience. Edit Also you must expect to invest long term even when timing the market. You might make some fast gains but youll have to accept tying some  up for yrs if you time the market and dont want to lose big.  It seems like taking a break for a while would be good mentally.

2866553,0,t3_2sw33b,Great comments.  One important thing to remember when calculating your return is that you cant use a one year calculation for your return on investment and assume this in perpetuity.  This exaggerates your IRR.  The majority of the payment which goes into paying down of your mortgage does not continue to earn the same IRRit is reinvested at a lower rate unless you are in constant refi mode impractical and expensive.  Take the first example.  If you had a k investment in real estate that actually compounded at  per annum you would end up with over  million after  years.  Instead you end up with K a year that you need to reinvest hopefully at high rates and k property that is now worth close to k assuming  annual appreciation on a  year note you would owe kstill a great investment.  I own a bunch of units with ridiculous cap rates  that a oneyear back of the envelop would suggest around a  return.  E.g. k total cost with a  loan to value gives me an allin cost close to k.   appreciation k .k in principal paydown be sure to exclude interest costs and k in fullyinsured postmaintenance posthoa fees postmanagement aftertax cash flows.  k.k.k .kk. yes its a finely tuned machine.  However over the multiyear period my allin after tax yield is something close to half of that ish as I dont just get to pull out that .k for reinvestment every year.  Still better than what youll average in the stock market and stocks are my profession.  Just something to take into account.  I would argue that you should expect something closer to  over a multiyear time horizon if you are investing at something closer to a  cap rate postcost rental yield with  down at current interest rates.  Also dont forget to calculate your return on invested time when looking at owning multiple units.  Spending hours with collection and facilitating smooth operations can really turn into something unproductive if you arent careful.Also remember that your rental estate income is taxed at ordinary rates.  ,investing,cntxeyz,1,t5_2qhhq

This will give you a modest return hopefully negate inflation and allow you peace of mind that it will be worth more than what you put in  year later.If you want to invest for the long term and have a high risk tolerance then check out low fee index mutual funds andor ETFs.  You buy one share in these funds which then disperses the cash among hundreds if not thousands of companies to spread out your risk.  You shouldnt by more than . fee and no upfront fees to do this.  Vanguard funds and Fidelity Spartan funds are good places to look.  Dont get cute... stick with the basics...

The reason is that it is practically impossible to nominate directors for election to the board without picking up a proxy fight. So the way to the board is via a blessing of the company in the form of company nomination and corresponding recommendation to the shareholders to vote their proxies FOR that nominee.  percent of current board members of public companies in the US are company nominees. Most directors get paid substantially for doing work only  days per year. In turn they repay the favor to the execs by rubberstamping all proposals of the execs who put them on the board.

The system of executive compensation in the US is badly flawed and is often the reason for execs pilfering their own companies. I always look at executive compensation in evaluating a company. A classic example is CVS vs Walgreens. CVS pays massive executive compensation corporate jets etc. Walgreens on the other hand is very frugal. I like that. Unfortunately Walgreens does other things wrong and the share price does not fairly reflect their fugal corporate management.,investing,cobg6cg,2,t5_2qhhq

Their question is legit  why bother learning when you can just follow a professionals investment patterns? I have no interest in learning how my car works. When the check engine light comes on I take it to the shop. The few hundred dollars I might save every year isnt worth the investment of learning how my car can be fixed.

Now with the rapid expansion of their brand and the tripling of their number of stores the brand is losing its exclusivity ie it is no longer unique. Investors had priced in a rapid rate of growth however the recent growth repeatedly fails to meet investor expectations. Theyre a victim of their own success and their previous valuation was based on what now appears to be an unsustainable rate of growth. As for when the stock would become a buy I have no idea. I Know little about that particular sector. To me the valuation metrics are decent but it is a cyclical business and heavily relies on maintaining the affordable luxury appeal of the brand.

Systematically purchasing VIX calls can be a very expensive effort.  Unlike purchasing a put on the equityETF your holding the VIX is not as defined. I would be wary trading options on the VIX unless you are well versed in trading volatility.If you are going to use the VIX i would suggest looking at purchasing OTM calls as opposed to ATM calls.  For the same dollar allocation you can purchase far more contracts and when the VIX does spike the leverage you get from holding more contracts will offer far greater returns than purchasing at or in the money calls.  I would also avoid buying m calls systematically.  You will get killed by contango as evidenced by the performance drag on the m VIX strategy being the highest.  I find m VIX calls to be a sweet spot but it really depends on market conditions.If you had a strategy in mind Id be happy to give you my commentscritiques on it.

3084281,0,t3_2vgvel,sigh as an electrical engineer I at least have some ground in having dealt with tuned and worked on algorithms ADRC superior to PID for control systems.  Let me glance through those things but I already have a bias as to what my general reply will be...  Sidenote yes I have also dealt with PID systems.in the first link   gtThe rebalancing is dictated by an asset selection technique consisting in the optimization ofriskadjusted return by means of asset allocation methodologies based on the PID feedback control modelingprocedureDoes not sound like a coherent thought to be honest...  The only thing I can suspect this means is that somehow they are measuring the risk of the portfolio and adjusting the portfolio based off of that...?gt In fact the PID controller tends to take into consideration the natural phenomena occurring in thedynamics of time series for example if too much push has been given towards more risky assets in order toincrease return then memory inertia and other dynamic effects cause overshoot and excessive acceleration inthat phase the PID actuator attempts to anticipate such behavior by counteracting ahead of time in order tosmooth out the previous effect.Is total bullshit.  PID is not anticipatory.  ADRC is anticipatory hence part of why better.  The other to mention here is that PID is  not built for a random system exactly.  It is meant more for systems which are becoming too extreme too hot or too cold not a system which randomly jumps between hot and cold as PID can only respond to the previous error.  Again NOT anticipatory.gtThe controller despites the unavailability of the mathematical model for the plant attempts to regulate the dynamics of the portfolio by rebalancing the weights of the different assets in such away to force the portfolio riskadjusted return to approach the set pointNot the first time they mentioned this and it is pissing me off too much to not say something...  You cannot tune a PID without having some basic math model of the plant  There are  variables and in order to make the thing actually work in any meaningful way you must have some basic model otherwise the system may respond much too slow take years instead of days to rebalance in this case or too fast system overshoots and sells everything when only needed to sell   GAH ANGRY FIST WAVING!!!!gtNine asset classes have beenchosen EURUSD Nikkei DJIA China  Cp Index Hang Seng Y Treasury Bond SMI SwissIndex Gold ounce and USDJPY. These asset classes were picked so that their mix allows achieving agood portfolio diversification. Duh fuck?  I am not an expert on portfolios not an expert on PID also I admit but I have never seen a more weird looking portfolio...gtThis routine gets repeated for the whole observation period on a monthly frequency atthe end of each month for  years from  until So PID has  parts.  Proportional responds to error immediately.  Integral takes a long time to build up Derivative actually can cause the system to be unstable frequently a PI controller is used and Derivative is left out haha.  The I part will run  times once a month for  years.  This may not sound bad since  is a  digit number.  The problem is that the I term is useless until after it has builtup over time.  Without knowing that actual variables they used I have no way of knowing if the I term even did anything or if it was all from the D term...So looking at the data at the end the buyhold portfolio returned  the PID returned .I cannot take this thing seriously... okay I will now type out my opinion on the matter.Opinion meant for entertainment purposes onlyAsset allocation is meant to allow someone to who does not know what the future holds to decrease volatility.  A PID controller takes past error and changes the system to overcome the error.  Great application for PID would be a thermostat if the room is too cold it turns on the heater and if the room is WAY too cold if you have an advanced heating system which most do not... the heater turns on full blast.  If the room temp is only a little below what the thermostat is set for then the heater only turns on a little.  However the PID is based off of the concept ofIf there is an error too cold the thing looks to see if the error is constant increasing or decreasing and it changes the system how much heat out of heater to add so that the error goes away without causing a new error.A new error would be the thermostat is set for  degrees the room starts at  then goes to  then back to  then back to  etc.  The thermostat is great at seeing  and making sure the system works in that situation.  The PID cannot do much good if the system is .  It just cannot do that haha.  Maybe a PD controller could do something actually a D only system might be best in that case but even then the PID just is not meant for that type of system because there is not steady state!  A room temperature has a steady state where you have so much continual loss along with a few unknowns opening the door.  The stock market is just noise for most intents and purposes there is no steady state to reach and therefore if the PID works is it pure luck.I am not reading through the second link because the first made me angry...,investing,cohon7w,5,t5_2qhhq

3207787,0,t3_2wqmq5,Ya Im really not sure. I actually see the gaming industry in a state of decline right now. Theres no innovation consoles are losing market share PC gaming is not viable for everyone expensive and a level of technical knowledge is required... right now and the popular microtransaction business model that is sweeping gaming industry by storm right now is seriously alienating consumers. I honestly see this microtransaction business model as somewhat of a bubble.  Its creating strong shortterm profits but its chipping away at longterm growth and stability. The question is when will it pop? There are  major variables at play as to when this might happen. First consumer interest right now consumer interest is high in indie gaming which is a PERFFECT place to implement microtransactions and this is where the industry is seeing the most innovation in terms of game design. These simple games cant sustain for long though. Second just how deep can micro transactions go before theres serious backlash? Thirdly innovative products are always a game changer and thats especially the case in the gaming industry. I see two major game changers on the horizon the occulus and a standardized PC system for the living room think STEAM console. TLDR  Ive already written a novel but basically I see EA stock declining relatively soon maybe within a year. Once it does start to decline itll see at least a mo to a year steady decline before it rebounds. EA is one of the great evil businesses  i.e. it holds some powerful cards and it knows its unlikely to go out of business so it can shoot for shortterm gains fall and then do it all over again. They really dont need a longterm strategy. ,investing,couhia0,1,t5_2qhhq

3277318,0,t1_cp1sg7b,I dont see or I outright disagree with that more frequent adjustments idea.  The bidask spread is a trivial overhead on each share of ETF bought and resold.  But if you do too much buying and reselling as compared to holding that trivial overhead would exceed the expense ratio benefit of the ETF compared to having K or more in the related mutual fund.    The ETF still has the advantage of not having the K lower limit.    But ETFs still make more sense for long term hold than for trading.    Maybe you just mean the mental overhead of noticing when you accumulated enough for another share and placing the buy order as opposed to set and forget your buy policy.  But I think of set and forget as mainly referring to what I think most investors should do with shares of ETFs mutual funds or individual stocks after buying them.  Dont follow them.

An all stock portfolio may have an expected annual return arithmetic mean of  and a standard deviation of . This means a  sd move would drop your portfolio by . In a retirement account no big deal but if you were looking to buy a house in the next year with a  down payment that would hurt a lot.

If markets do take a dive and you have a   Bond portfolio and you decide not to b a house you have rebalance and buy stocks at bargain prices.

Its a substantial amount. But it is not a big number in the greater scheme of life.  Its peanuts when you take a step back and think about it.  There will be no other substantial life expense as cheap as this.  Everything from cars houses kids wedding day... all of it more expensive than  years of education.  K is often what people spent on a hobby.  So yes its a substantialfeeling number for people just getting out of school.  But in the course of life events its peanuts.  I used to live in the ghetto and pretty much everyone has a clunker including my family including pretty much everyone we knew.  The horror stories of cars blowing up are told to millennial who are gobbing it up as an excuse to buy a pretty new car.  Used cars do break down more often and require a bit more work but thats life you either pay a lot for convenience and comfort or you save money and work your ass off fixing stuffsourcing stuff.  And no Im not talking about the bullshit of certified used cars.  Buying from stealerships is worse than buying from a random person.  Believe it or not most people are not out there to screw you and time their car sales perfectly so that it still runs good but it will blow up in a month.  Buy used buy from other people use a little judgement learn to do your own oil change and change your alternator if you dont have the money to pay for the convenience of a mechanic.  That is how poorer people do it.  They dont make up excuses to blow money on Uber.  And in a lot of cases they can often resell the car for almost what they paid for it or even turn a small profit.

Tesla pours all of their money into PPampE and havent actually turned a profit yet theyre a bit of a bad example to use as a successful company. Theyre solidly in growth phase and may never actually realize their potential. In a best case scenario when theyre producing free cash flow profit above and beyond cap ex they would likely distribute that to shareholders as a dividend. A company that is producing huge amounts of free cash and not investing it in their own business is just hoarding money and theyll be prime targets for activist investors who will demand seats on their boards and influence management that way. There isnt really any incentive for management not to declare a dividend if they dont have a better use for the money. Most of them have compensation programs that are either tied to share price or involve direct ownership in the company which means they themselves will receive the dividend or at very least suffer the downside of investors not wanting to own a company run by people misallocating capital.,investing,cph0at0,2,t5_2qhhq

Switching to GaAs substrates while technologically achievable introduces an immense amount of risk to what is already a mature and profitable industry. Companies like Intel and TSMC are risk averse. They will not entertain the idea of a technology shift that could knock their yields down to single digits and swiftly bankrupt them  especially not if an alternative is available.Instead mm wafers will continue to be made of silicon since decades of infrastructure and experience exists for silicon. Very small amounts of InGaAs  InP probably will be epitaxially deposited onto these tradtional silicon substrates and integrated into nextgeneration devices.If I was looking to invest in IIIV I would be looking at stuff like MOCVD epitaxy ALD and MBE but I dont think there are any equipment companies in that space that are A public and B not gigantic.,investing,cq18tj8,4,t5_2qhhq

So for example  stock split Before you might have  shares worth  each after you will have  shares worth  each. The investment is still worth . Your broker handles the details and you dont have to do anything.  reverse stock split Before you have  shares worth  each. After you have  shares worth  each. As with the prior example the value of the investment remains the same and the broker handles the details. If there are remaining shares e.g. if you had  shares left over they are bought back and you get a small cash payment.The first example is commonly done by a company that is growing and expects to continue to grow. The latter the reverse stock split is generally performed by companies which are not doing well.The decision to split the stock is completely separate from the decision to pay a dividend. It should be clear this is the case from understanding that the stock split does not involve any change in total value of the company nor is money changing hands. Its just a bookkeeping exercise.You may then ask why split. If the price of the stock can be kept in the range of roughly  to  give or take it makes it easier to buy and sellthat is it improves liquidity. But its not a hardandfast rule.

3704791,0,t1_cqebvws,So if you look at that table youll see that when you are below the  tax bracket dividends and longterm capital gains are taxed at . Its not quite that simple but thats the gist of it.Lets say you end up getting k in dividends transfer k from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA and sell and repurchase stock for a total of k in capital gains. Your k will be covered by standard deduction and personal exemptions and will be available taxfree and penaltyfree after  years. The dividends and longterm capital gains will be taxed at  because all of your income was under .k. So the idea is to maximize the taxfree space each and every year to prevent taxes in the future.Another thing that isnt mentioned is taxloss harvesting. If your stocks decrease in value you can sell them and use them to offset gains this year or push the loss to future years to offset gains in those years. That means that if a stock completely plummets and you sell you can sell and repurchase stock that had gains so that that amount doesnt count toward the longterm capital gains tax.,investing,cqekkel,1,t5_2qhhq

While it is difficult to debate the intentions of the management spending money on animal enclosures its fairly easy to rule out for the animals as they have no responsibility or duty towards them. Their only goal is to maximize profit.Of course keeping the animals alive as long as possible and positive public perception are benefits to the corporation. So they will ensure that the animals are healthy but there is nothing to encourage them to do more than the bare minimum. Its all a balancing act like any of the line items on a corporations bottom line. Just like Apple produces iPhones picks a price point and has a general rule of thumb for the most profitable expected duration of each phone Sea World has commodified a living creature and uses the exact same methods to extract the highest profit. This is fundamental to the existence of any corporation. While I agree that they havent captured wild animals in awhile that is simply because they dont need too or would get in too much trouble. They are easily able to breed the whales they do have to ensure a reliable product moving forward.As for statement that an Orca at Sea World has more intellectual stimulation that in the wild is pure conjecture. And it is these kinds of statements that make people feel better about playing god and thinking they always know what is best for others. Additionally you are only taking in a single factor of what living is about. If someone put you in a cage but made sure you where fed and had sufficient stimulation could we say that you are better off? I apologize for making a harsh comparison but this is the same rational that was used when defending the slave trade That by feeding clothing educating and providing stimulation they were actually benefiting the slaves. While I understand that I am making a stretch here using that comparison as common thinking is that Orcas and people are very different I hope that a few decades in the future we will look back on this as a fault in our society or perhaps just ignorance.,investing,cqirmlx,1,t5_2qhhq

3757035,0,t3_33fvg4,BIPIX is a leveraged fund that tries to follow the biotechnology sector at .x daily results.Ill try to break down what that means first and then explain why its not particularly suitable for most investors.The UltraSector part of the name indicates that the fund borrows money this is called leverage to invest. Because of this the gains and losses in the portfolio of stocks it tracks are multiplied. In particular this fund tries to make its daily performance equal to . times what the stocks do on each day. At the end of the day it buys or sells stocks to keep the margin the amount of money borrowed at the right level to make this true.The most important effect of this for investors is that any change to the stocks is amplified  if they go up the fund goes up even more if they go down the fund goes down even more. This creates what investors call volatility  it means that the prices are unstable. Normally investors view volatility as a bad thing  it means that when you need the money it might be down a lot.Furthermore daily rebalancing funds can amplify losses if the underlying stocks go up and down a lot. For example if the fund starts at  and the stocks go down  the fund which is tracking .x will go down .. The next day if the stocks go up  the fund will go up .. However . of the lower value does not bring you back up to where you started. So even though the underlying stocks are close to where you started youve lost money in the fund because it sold stocks at the bottom to cover its margin requirements.Additionally the risk of this fund is amplified even more because it invests in a single sector  biotechnology. It just so happens that stocks in the biotechnology sector have done extremely well over the last few years. This could be a bubble it could be real value but either way it was no simple task to know that this would happen  years ago.The main takeaway  the fund that had the highest return over the last N years where N lt  is almost always going to be a fund that is extremely risky. Note that the fund that does the worst is probably also going to be one that was extremely risky.  years ago it was impossible to know which of these funds would do really well.Its sort of like if you went to the casino and found everybody who won at the roulette table. You might ask why didnt everybody else give them their money to play with  they clearly know what theyre doing? But its a ridiculous question  they got lucky.

I was still trying to move out and save up a basic emergency fund so investing wasnt a real possibility yet but I was reading and trying to get some basic knowledge. I too was intrigued by GTAT and even thought about maybe trying to put some money in it. I mentioned it to one of my coworkers in July or something talking about how I thought the stock would skyrocket after the announcement of the iPhone  and all that. But as I said luckily I wasnt really in a position to invest yet. Sure enough that stock basically just lost  of its value in a day or whatever. It was the perfect thing at the perfect time to teach me a lesson  itd be like if an airplane security contractors first day was on . It was the first stock I was interested in and followed and it illustrated basically the worst case scenario of why speculating on hyped up relatively unestablished stocks is a bad bad idea.

In regard to what your adviser said these funds are supposed to reach an allocation of primarily bonds by the time the target date is reached. The idea is to lockin so to speak your growth of the years and decrease the volatility of your portfolio.

I would caution you if he is suggesting you should still have a stockheavy portfolio at that point in your life.

4107376,0,t3_37nr5q,Imagine a bank vault that you wont have access to for precisely  years. It is filled with cash one hundred thousand dollars. Now lets say you have a piece of paper a certificate officially stating that you own  of the vault.The certificate isnt as good as money but it certainly has value. In  years you have a legal right to collect your . Though imagine if you wanted to sell this certificate to get your money today  how much do you think you can get for it? Certainly not the full thousand for the buyer would want some kind of return lets say  to protect against inflation while earning some income. You thus could expect to sell your certificate today for .Now imagine a bank teller who on an annual basis makes deposits into the vault. Your  claim to the vault will thus grow on an annual basis. Assuming again a  required rate of return here is a breakdown of your certificates value today its present value under several circumstancesAnnual Deposit|Vault Value in  Years|Certificate Value Today|||||||||||||So when were talking about stocks the company is the vault the deposit is in simple terms profit and the certificate is the portion of the company you own via common shares. When a company earns more money makes higher deposits into the vault the value of the shares rise just as the certificate did and when profits fall or turn negative the value of the shares fall with them. This is obviously a generalization because as you can imagine our future expectations of profits also weigh on todays share price. This is because unlike the vault we dont assign any lifespan to a company under normal circumstances its essentially infinite. If a company posts a huge profit today but I expect it to hemorrhage money from here on out I will probably see a sharp decline in my position. Take a look at the third circumstance from the tablewhere a  withdrawal is made every yearand you can see the share price still has a value. I know that there will be money left after  years. What if the vaults lifespan was assumed infinite? Without hope for a change in the negative outflow the certificate is worthless. If however there is such a potential for a turnaround now the certificate looks more like a speculative common stock and the market will determine a value for it.Hopefully the mathematical relationship of share price to profit makes more sense now. What may seem baffling is this infinite lifespan. The phrasing just means that we dont know how long a company will be around for and corporations arent formed with an end date in mind. So you may wonder why share prices still rise and fall with profit when theres no actual promise of shareholders getting any actual cash disbursements? Two fundamental reasons. Companies can pay dividends to shareholders. A general rise in profit can indicate higher future dividend payments or at the very least suggests sustainability of current disbursements. As mentioned by others these stream of dividend payments will help determine the value of the firm.. Just like the vault common shares represent your ownership of the firm in question. Even if you never get a dividend payment because as a common shareholder the firm has absolutely no obligation to pay you any you still have an ownership stake in the firm and in turn your stake appreciates with the growth of the company. When the vault gets bigger so does the value of your claim to it even if you dont personally make withdrawals. Society regards legal contracts such as shares of stock very highly as our entire financial system functions off of the trust that we give to such instruments. As a common shareholder you can confidently consider yourself a partner in that firm and your shares will be regarded by the market as having real value exchangeable for cash.,investing,crogsp4,4,t5_2qhhq

4139784,0,t1_crrtcfd,Interesting article based on my quick review of it. There appears to be a few shortcomings in authors argument more to do with mathematics rather than financemarkets.Argument of using total return versus annualized return. As the chart in the article shows larger the time period larger the total return and also the larger the variance. Without normalizing the total returns for differences in length of time period will result in exactly the conclusions author is drawing law of large numbers. An appropriate measure of expected return is arithmetic mean of annualized return unbiased return and not total cumulative return as author is trying to do here specially when using standard deviation as measure of risk.Author refers to chapter  appendix C in Bodie Kane and Marcus Investments th edition for more details on this fallacy of time diversification. The authors paper also refers to same appendix in the book. This appendix has been removed from the th edition of the book that I have. In th edition book has Time vs Risk section in Chapter  that mentions the following that seems to contradict authors positiongt MANY BEGINNING INVESTORS eye the stock market with a bit of suspicion. They view equity investing as an anxious game of Russian roulette The longer they stay in the greater their chance of experiencing more losses. In fact history shows that the opposite is true. The easiest way to reduce the risk of investing in equitiesand improve the gainis to increase the time you hang on to your portfolio.Jeremy Siegel Stocks for the Long Run  examines US stocks over  years. While stocks are riskier than bonds in the short run over long run  year periods stock returns are so stable than stocks are actually less volatile over  years than either government bonds or treasury bills.Siegel found that stocks provided returns at least  higher than inflation and higher than cash or bonds in . of the rolling year periods from  through .Roger C Ibbotson and Rex Sinquefield Stocks Bonds Bills and Inflation Historical Returns  Geometric Means and Standard Deviation of Annual Returns from  to  Common stocks . .

4149109,0,t1_crt7056,As a general rule a trustee to trustee transfer of a Roth IRA which is what you want not a rollover is best initiated by contacting the financial institution that will be receiving the funds and asking them about the mechanics of getting it done.  The special case of the funds currently being in a timed deposit is outside my experience.  Maybe asking Vanguard everything about it is still correct or maybe that aspect must be asked from the credit union.    No one knows what the best bet is.  Most of us estimate guess that the extra risk of some Vanguard fund is justified by the likely extra reward compared to gradually losing out to inflation at a credit union.  But we dont know for certain that moving to Vanguard wont be a path to losing faster than inflation.    I dont really know your situation but K in cash and K in index funds I assume you mean in a taxable account and plans to put incremental cash flow into retirement accounts all feels to me like paying too little attention to that . loan.  Yes recent history would lead you to expect that money invested in mutual funds within retirement accounts is better than extra principle payments against a . loan.  But past performance especially recent is a poor predictor of what will happen next.  In your situation I would put some of your cash flow into paying extra principle so that loan ends earlier or so that you get more net cash out when you sell that house.,investing,crt7omd,1,t5_2qhhq

4168217,0,t1_crvcpu5,Be the underwriter.EDIT I asked a question kind of like before. thanks to uverik for shedding some light on the process.Allocation is offered to clients of the AM and brokerage legal entities. Your checking acct is with a separate legal entity. Your retirement account is irrelevant as well since its not eligible.Basically in a simple IPO firm guarantee ignore greenshoes or best effort options if an underwriter cant sell all the shares its taking delta risk on price movements which is exactly what an IB underwriter seeks to avoid delta risk is the focus of the markets desks not the role of ECMDCM guys. So because of this the IB does multiple things to make sure it doesnt get caught footing the bill    Puts on a road show presenting the firm its raising equity for to the larger clients that the IB feels would seek allocation. At road shows they can generally get conditional allocation assigned usually conditional on price as its not yet been established. This gives the IB a gauge of the market sentiment regarding the offering.    Will syndicate the offering thus taking a smaller chunk of shares to offer to clients and share both the risk AND fees with other IBs. This is why you see  major names that you think of as competitors when you look up the BABA syndicate.Because of this desire to get rid of shares as much as possible the ECM team is prioritizing large block allocations before smaller. If you have mm shares to sell and you have  institutional clients all wanting mm shares why would you ever bother saying no... let me see how many individuals from PWM want blocks of  shares first. Prioritization is based a lot on relationships and profitability of them because if you snub a mmyear pnl in equities overall client and they pick up share allocation from someone else in the syndicate guess who theyre going to be more inclined to trade balances with on the rest of the markets desks going forward? Its simple fact of life that an markets desk in any firm has no interest in risking trade volumes or future pnl of clients because they want to give the little guy some IPO allocation.If they are offering the little guy blocks of the allocation its generally because they made a pretty egregious miscalculation of market demand ran out of buyers at the institutional level.,investing,crvdv1v,11,t5_2qhhq

All HFT is recorded electronically and attached to the legal entity which executed it so would really not be difficult to discover through an audit.So I do not believe that there is widespread criminality that is endemic to the HFT industry.

4298158,0,t3_3a7zr3,Futures contracts such as options play an important role in the economy. The standard example is the farmer but it applies to options traders  as well. Ill go over the farming example though because its easier to illustrate the concept.Farming requires a substantial expenditure planting followed months later by revenues selling the crop. Farmers dont know in advance how much they are going to get for their crop. Futures contracts allow them to agree on delivering a certain amount of crop for a certain price. It therefore gives the farmer certainty about future revenues and allows him to collect at least some of those revenues sooner.The person who buys the farmers future crop by buying a futures contract is known as a speculator. Heshe shoulders the risk inherent in paying now for a future crop yield in exchange for a potential profit.The farmer cares more about the certainty of the revenues than the additional money he is probably foregoing by not selling the crop directly. The farmer is also equally motivated by the opportunity to get the money sooner.So the futures contract transfers risk from the farmer who does not want it to the speculator who is in the business of taking on risk.So both parties benefit from the transaction. And this is why futures contracts were created.To take an options example directly options can be used to hedge that is guard against the equity going in the wrong direction. So a shareholder might buy options for that reason. Heshe buys them from a speculator who is willing to shoulder the opposite side of the transaction in exchange for profit potential. Both sides benefit and both sides need each other exactly as in the above example. In all of the above speculator does not have a negative connotation. They are a necessary participant. Without them the options and futures markets would not function at all.Options markets are very mature and people participate in them for many reasons. The above is intended to illustrate the need they originally were created to fill.,investing,csa4jcc,0,t5_2qhhq

4314156,0,t3_3ae7o7,I have x in an investment account currently managed by a Financial Advisor.  I compared the accounts performance over the last  years to the SampP  and it didnt even come close to seeing the same returns.    I would have at least  more money if I had chosen the SampP . Recently my advisor at the company changed so Im kind of in limbo as to whether hell be working for me or not.  I am considering not using any advisor at all and putting my money into a low fee SampP  fund an international index fund and a smaller amount in bonds.  The new advisor tried to talk me out of it saying the SampP  made only  over the last ? years and the average financial advisor was able to get their clients .  Seems like he was cherrypicking years to make his point.  He also mentioned that the SampP  could tank and that a managed account would fare much better here.  This I agree with.Anyway my concern is that going into the SampP  now is a bad idea because it is up so far.  Should I use the FI to help me transition into the funds I mentioned over the next  years?  Should I just pull the trigger and do it now?  Or should I give the new advisor a chance?  he can work as a fiduciary at  if I choose     My goal I am in my late s and would like to have this money grow as much as possible by the time I am retired hopefully in my early s.

4488669,0,t1_cswebwt,From my perspective and most pleb investors they arent really going to ever have a lump sum  at least not at an appreciable amount that most investors would really consider a lump sum. So in that case it makes sense to invest like you said  what you can when you can. Just do it on a set schedule so you dont start skipping it.By buying that way say once every month even if you arent intending to it is still functionally the same thing as DCA isnt it? Even if you arent saying well its a little high right now so Ill take this k and invest k a month for the next  months its still more or less what youre doing. You just dont have the long term plan. The nice part is you likely end up with a much lower cost basis over time but you do lose out on the dividends if applicable because you didnt have the lump sum invested up front.If I or OP had a lump sum to invest I would really be torn honestly. Ive been in funds that have lost a TON before. Ive also been in stocks that have gone completely worthless. Id probably end up doing a mix of both based on current market conditions.You make some really good points.,investing,cswgity,2,t5_2qhhq

The bottom line is that anything that issues a large dividend does so via cash flow leveraging typically via debt.  If the cash flow dries up the impact is magnified by leverage and debt which can cause investment principle to drop to zero or close to it.

In addition the ETF may be forced to sell some of the assets by a change in the index being tracked or by an event such as a merger and that may yield net taxable capital gains within the ETF.  When the ETF itself has realized income it must by law distribute that at least once per year to its shareholders.  Unlike an ordinary corporation the ETF does not pay taxes on its own realized income.  Instead it distributes its realized income to its shareholders.

4731904,0,t3_3fqgma,The Greek stock market has been hammered for over five years now. Investing in a recovering Greece is not a bad idea but you will need a thesis when and why its stock market is going to recover. The main catalyst for Greeces current downturn is the austerity is being imposed by Europethe Troijka. Its debt to GDP ratio has significantly increased over the past years  Debt increased while its GDP has been severely crippled by the austerity measures imposed. This is a selfreinforcing circle and Greece does not have a shock absorption mechanism such as its own currency.You might argue that austerity did work in certain instances. I.e. Germany has used austerity in its past and thrived afterwards. However Germany has an exportdriven economy. Foreign countries pay a premium for German products and it is able to run huge trading surpluses to attract foreign inflows of cash. Furthermore Germany actually produces a lot roughly  of its workforce is employed in the agricultural or industrial sector. Now lets compare that to Greece. Greeces has a economy built on services attributing to over  of its economy. It does not run trading surpluses it has lived on cheap cash since investors expected Germany to back Greece in case of downturn. Greece has effectively lived on Germanys balance sheet c.q. cheap credit. I pointed out that Greece does not have its own national currency. You might argue that Germany does not have its own currency either. This is true but in practice with Germany being the economically largest and strongest country in the Eurozone it has a strong influence on the value of the Euro. Effectively it sets the value of the Euro and thus has a strong position during economic downturns. When would I invest in Greece? a Europe becoming a fiscal union instead of only a monetary union andor b Greece leaving the Eurozone and adapting its own currency andor c Europe deciding to cut Greeces debt to a sustainable level  of GDP. Strictly my personal view of course. ,investing,ctqzy9l,10,t5_2qhhq

Continuing on the same graphic do you know why Wells Fargo sells the ownership of the loan in the first place to Goldman Sachs rather creating trust on their own and thus receiving an additional  on the mortgage payments by the Harisses? However even including Goldman Sachs to the picture does in my opinion not make securitization a moral hazard on itself. We see forms of securitizations every day in life. You dentist doesnt ask you to pay your bills he sells the invoices to a third party who bears the risk in return for a discount on the invoices. Selling risk for a discount is a service that function as a lubricant for society. However when parties starts bearing more risk than they can possibly bear banks thats when we need additional checks and balances. Securitization on itself is good it shifts risk to a party who wants to bear the risk and in principle makes  bank more safe. As you explained apparently Goldman Sachs or any other bank involved in this practice still keep some of the risks on their books. Such practices should fall under stricter regulation andor accounting rules should be improved for such assets. In general we simply need more transparency for banks.   Assumed given that banks provide enough transparency about their products I.e. CDOs so that both institutional and individual investors can make a deliberate and wellinformed decision on whether or not to buy the products offered. ,investing,ctte3np,3,t5_2qhhq

I would not use them as a vehicle of investment.Investing in wine is notoriously dangerous and difficult. Weve seen a bubble in China about  years ago which has now fully exploded and seen some serious investment quality wines tank. There is also an issue in that the current Bordeaux market is swamped with unsold overpriced wine that the producers tried to cash in on and now dont know what to do with.Without a full and comprehensive understanding of these issues I would be very wary of investing in Bordeaux right now.Your other alternative is Burgundy  but you need access to the top allocations to get investment worthy wines that are guaranteed to grow. A few producers to consider are Fourrier Mugnier Roumier DRC Coche Dury Drouhin Comtes Lafon Leflaive Ramonet Lafarge and Rousseau to name just a cluster of the top. You need to be buying in cases and storing In Bond i.e. duty has not been paid in a temperature controlled and secure warehouse that you can always refer to for provenance. You then have the issue of picking vineyard and of course vintage. Both are crucial.There are definitely managed wine funds. They are notorious for scams. Some do exist and I have a friend that runs a legit one if you are really interested I can make an intro but they require serious amounts of money k plus annually to be worthwhile. In general the market has performed very poorly over the last  years and buying in now is likely to only see a gain if you stick with the investment for  years in my opinion. If you really want to make a crack at this  use Live Ex to learn a bit about the market and then trade on Wineowners.com.But my advice is unless you innately know wine its not worth playing the game as its too easy to get fucked over.

The key to success lies in the path of least resistance i.e. dominate the market in areas that allow it.  Consumers will ultimately be the driving force behind underlying social change which views ridesharing as a legitimate replacement to taxi services.  Uber will be able to ride that momentum to lobby local governments.Again I dont see this as a limiting factor to Ubers growth because Ubers desired end state is not replacing taxi drivers with uber drivers.  Their goal is to totally eliminate the human element with fleets of autonomous vehicles.  CabTaxi companies are dying businesses and no matter how badly they fight time will press forward relentlessly.  The future is driverless cars providing seamless ondemand transportation they are safer ideal for cities because they have knowledge of every street amp traffic conditions and cheaper.I just really want to take driverless ubers dammit....,investing,cu8j4ai,1,t5_2qhhq

By the time a retail investor gets news it is too late for the news to be helpful.  That is just as true if you are closely watching one stock as if you are failing to watch a hundred.

Interest rates movr with risk so if a lender is anticipating a number of late payments  which by the way is an indication of default risk they will raise the rate accordingly. The real answer is low rates are just a product of subsidized finance arms of manufacturers to incentive sales.  But that doesnt sell as well as theyre fucking over the consumer with other things.

Price is definitely tagged to rates  just inverselyin a rising rate environment price will fall. Not sure what you mean by total return for bonds. Real reigns will definitely suffer and total returns will likely suffer too.This requires a bit more explanation  higher interest rates are usually tied to inflation and or growth higher interest rates therefore tend to mean more real economics growth. In these environments you will see incremental returns in assets with higher economic beta  e.g. stocks  an incremental selling in stocks. This will mean two compounding factors  bonds will fall as a purely mechanic reaction to interest rate rises and this will be compounded by waste flows out of the asset class and into higher retirning asset classes.,investing,cvqyh9l,0,t5_2qhhq

They sell a highly scalable product increasing marginal profit to subscribers on a recurring subscription model.  Each new customer is literally a constant revenue stream theoretically forever.  Its not as though they are selling objects that are purchased once and dont need to be purchased again go proIm looking at you!. So the better question might be whats a good price for a claim on future monthly cash flow of a rapidly growing customer base?  Also considering that the recent price change brings that cash flow stream up . Im not saying youre wrong at all you might be very right  just asking if you think this is an appleapples comparison.  Im of the mind that many of the highly scalable SaaSsubscription based companies are worth more than traditional companies because theyre so much profitable in the long term.

Once that happens they can no longer spend that borrowed money which reduces the income of others. Which reduces the amount of money THEY can borrow and the cycle continues until the economy deleverages back to a normal value and can recover... by borrowing again.

Meaning if your not getting paid a good dividend then you should stay away from low PE companies.Value investing is doing fundamental research and noticing that the market price for a stock is below the intrinsic value of a stock. Which is pretty rare nowadays in my opinion since our markets are pretty efficient.  So if you are going to use PE and PB use it in comparison to historical values of the industry and itself. Also you have to research if the PE is low for a good reason such as shrinking market share lower margin trends etc. or because it is truly undervalued.This is extremely difficult to discern and can not be done by simply looking at the PE or PB and saying its low.,investing,cwvqy0f,2,t5_2qhhq

There is some IRS formula that your brokerage will use to determine what the current value of your contribution is and that amount will be removed from your Roth IRA and put into a new traditional IRA. Since you cant deduct traditional IRA contributions anyway your tax liability for the current year doesnt change and the tax on future withdrawals from your new traditional IRA will depend on your gains as calculated against the .The hilarious part of all of this is that your optimal move is to immediately convert the traditional IRA into your existing Roth IRA and then report that conversion.

Its not terribly difficult to find a duplex where your PITI payment is lower than the rent that you would get from the other half meaning you can live for free not accounting for vacancy and maintenance.If you want to try something like this you should save enough for a down payment plus an extra k or so to cover emergency repairs if the furnace dies in the middle of winter it needs to be replaced immediately so you need the cash on hand to cover it.

Norfolk does not seem pleased by the offer but the market seems to think theres a chance or if they say no that CP will perhaps go hostile and it would not surprise me if Ackman played offense.Canadian Pacific is offering Norfolk Southern shareholders . in cash and . Canadian Pacific shares.I dont think thats a bad deal. Im not real excited by Norfolk  would be far more excited if CP bought KSU and were able to go through Canada the US and into Mexico  but I do trust CPs Harrison and they appear to believe that they can bring Norfolks high operating ratio down. With . of Norfolks carloads being coal in  and the outlook for coal not exactly improving if I was Norfolk the idea of a merger would seem appealing but perhaps its just me.Personally as someone who has an investment in a number of railroads I think what interests me about this merger is not necessarily this merger but if it actually does go through does it become a land grab with CSX and Kansas City Southern in play?A fair amount of it revolves around Chicago and the congestion there if companies are not having to hand off to each other in Chicago that changes things quite a bit.,investing,cx4gfi0,1,t5_2qhhq

5776804,0,t3_3u82er,hi there im  and work in finance. ive been the guy on the other end of the phone that you call with questions and am very knowledgable with regards to retirement investing. the TLDR for any person is essentially this. if youre not rich stick to a roth ira i define not rich as making less than  figures. seriously roth is amazing. once you have your roth ira try to contribute as much as you can but keep in mind this shouldnt be your only savings. true financial well being comes with  tiers of management. you have short term cash which is your checking account and things you pay bills out of or use for fun you have your emergency fund which should hold  months of expenses and should remain liquid think high yield savings account not CDs or bonds and you have your retirement accounts which are investing long term think stocks and more aggressive investments.the general rule of thumb is to try to save  for retirement. if you cant do this dont. if you dont have the st and nd tiers detailed above you shouldnt save for retirement at all until this is accomplished. once youre there you need to make sure you are investing the money in tier  properly. dont put it in something super aggressive like a sector fund and dont put it in something conservative like a government bond fund. the best thing i can say to anyone starting out is to use a target date fund. target date funds are essentially autopilot and are designed in such a way that they are always age appropriate and are never too aggressive or conservative. once you do more research and feel comfortable in your actions you can change from a target date fund to a personalized portfolio but generally speaking youd be better off in the target date fund. most people think they know what theyre doing and dont. dont be one of those people. odds are if you havent been investing for decades or dont work in finance you are going to mess it up. trust in the target date fund it is a godsend.as far as rather or not to do anything with the credit union i advise against it. id point you to either vanguard or fidelity. doing this you are guaranteed to not get stuck with fees and are given literally thousands of options to invest your money. you can grow from a basic target date fund investor into a complex sector rotating pro all while keeping the same account since day one and not paying a single fee for the privilege. small banks and credit unions have IRAs but generally theyre only going to have an extremely limited line up of investments or are going to come with fees that the big dogs in the industry wouldnt be charging you. vanguard and fidelity are where you should be.this was a long post but it is definitely the tldr. if you have more questions ask theres lots more to learn.,investing,cxd60t4,2,t5_2qhhq

Typically young people have something they are saving for which makes the stock market too risky. Sometimes young people with a solid career are advised to invest  in stocks like you are contemplating. However other wise advisors point out that young people are not as risk averse as they might think and these young people with new careers would be better starting with a fund that is more like  stocksbonds until they have experienced the drama of a bear market. But thats not you yet either. So while we dont know enough to advise you I wish to encourage you to simply consider an FDICinsured bank account like LMCU where you can earn  as safe as it getsperhaps for both this  and for your emergency fund.

5871613,0,t3_3voey6,I have folks read Wall Street MBA if they are curious on how to understand basic corporate finance. Now this is an end around solution to your question but the better you understand what your investing in hypothetically the better your returns. I tend to recommend folks practice whats called Value Investing which is buying solid companies with good financials when they are down because of market conditions outside of they control. Basically buying low and holding for an indefinite amount of time. Now from my view Im suggesting a buy and hold mentality if you want to do any sort of day trading I dont have a great answer other then dont do it. But if you are looking to build a stock portfolio that is meant for retirement or general capital appreciation this book is a good place to build a foundation of knowledge. Its a pretty hard read through but treat it as though your taking a class. Its going to give you a very brief albeit comprehensive overview of corporate finance which will allow you to find and build a portfolio with stocks.

There are a number of geopolitical reasons why oil simply cant stay under  for too long. But theres no knowing how long it may stay under  or what it may rally back to once market conditions change.There are plenty of other sectors which may easily outperform oil in the coming monthsyears and are much less of a gamble. Also I agree with other commenters here that the safest play is likely in large producers such as CVXXOMRDSTOT etc. But be forewarned that we have not necessarily seen the bottom yet and there is no consensus as to what the bottom might be.

Gold on the other hand is merely an input. We attach value to gold partially for historic reasons and partially because it plays a role as production input. That is not to say it is bound to decrease in value historically it hasnt but its a far less sure bet than companies  no matter what you think of such companies. If you want to reduce your reliance on energy and have a more healthy lifestyle you can of course do that. You can even volunteer to promote better more sustainable lifestyles. In various ways not only energy we as the human population can do much better to decrease our footprint. You can alter your investment strategy for such reasons i.e. by investing in sustainable funds rather than your regular total marketSampP fund. ,investing,cxvainb,1,t5_2qhhq

6111419,0,t3_3z7mj7,gt That would lead to some shortterm gains and transaction fees    Maybe transaction fees but not taxable gains.  Gains are not taxed in a Roth early withdrawals may be taxed but otherwise a Roth is not taxed at all.    You cant transfer securities the way you want.  Even if the law allowed you to it definitely doesnt the brokerage would charge you higher fees for that than the commissions you want to avoid.    So if your strategy were sound you dont have better tactics than sell in the Roth and buy back in the Roth the asset mix you prefer then buy outside the Roth the asset mix you want there even if it is exactly what you just sold in the Roth.    But your strategy is also likely wrong or Im reading too much into your choice of the word trades as opposed to investments.  If you think you are competent to beat the indexes by trading try that in your Roth account not in your taxable account.  In your taxable account your optimum choice would be a mix of individual growth stocks held very long term tax loss harvesting the losers and never touching the winners.    Before you do any of the above review your choice of brokerage.  If you can get a significantly better deal in another brokerage enough to justify whatever your current brokerage charges for transferring the assets out sooner is better than later and definitely better than dumping more assets into a brokerage with high fees.  If you already have a decent deal from a brokerage give more thought to your lot size.  Your are investing for profit not for entertainment.  If your total portfolio is too small to get a great account from a broker like Merrill Edge then you should slow way down the rate at which you buy and sell.

6145669,0,t1_cynuloa,It seems to me that you are having a kneejerk reaction to something you didnt fully understand. Im guessing from what you wrote the you have a CS background but not much experience in financial markets or economics.The  years is the forecast horizon the y variable. Youd obviously need to use a much longer time span of data. I use almost  years in some of my analyses.Using the aggregate PE ratio is only an example of the most basic approach. Im not saying that its the only piece of information to consider. For the aggregate market at  year horizons valuation ratios do have predictive power. Keep in mind though that the signals such PE are slow moving monthly autocorrelation gt . so you cant expect them to forecast turning points next month or even next year. Youll also find that most of the signals that might be relevant at short horizons weeks months dont work at longer horizons.Im very sympathetic to what you are saying about the need to build models that generalize well. Im an old school trader and not a CS expert but Kfold crossvalidation is probably not the best way conceptually for this application since it assumes independent observations. The time series of stock market returns obviously could be dependent. I generally use a onestep ahead recursive forecast approach to check for outofsample performance and guard against overfitting.Beyond purely statistical or machine learning approaches which have limitations for predicting long horizon returns given the low signaltonoise and very limited number of data points  remember we are predicting only a single return series not trying to model the crosssection of individual stock returns you need to inject additional information into your model to help it perform better. That could come in the form of qualitative priors perhaps using a Bayesian framework or by adding more structure to the model e.g. using a dividend discount model.,investing,cyo74wq,1,t5_2qhhq

A company in solar  years ago would be producing solar panels for about  per watt which is hugely expensive now days the price per watt of solar is actully below or barely above depending on your sources coal. Given the fact that solar is essentially limitless releases far fewer emmissionsmanufacturing releases them removes your reliance on the grid and as technology progresses will likely become even more energy efficient if i recall they only conver lt aroind  of the suns rays so there an ipside of at least  makes solar a no brainer. If you observe solar adoption trends youll notice an exponential curve  that is almost certain to keep rocketing up.Knowing that solar is going to be massive in the near future is really shouldnt be up for debate give  its merits.

Eventually  years depending on what you believe well need to make some of the shortfall consumption is reducing but not fast enough and part of the demand is being replaced by India  China with fracking  oil sands which means higher prices.I think shortterm were looking at  and longer term maybe .

Any company that earns money can either distribute that money to share holders OR reinvest the money with the belief that it will result in higher future returns for shareholders.But also companies do stock buybacks which are a less direct way of distributing money to shareholders.  As they reduce the number of outstanding shares the price of the remaining shares will move proportionately up.  This has the benefit of being a capital gain too instead of a dividend.And sometimes youll get a special distribution or cash from a buyout.So the simple answer is yes stocks do generate cash flow over time just often not in as simple a way as other assets like a a personal business of bond.,investing,czqd5j5,1,t5_2qhhq

Needless to say if you have room to still put money into a tax advantaged account it is a good option to look into. Anyways while yes in a way it is just your money given back to you in another real way the price you buy in at and the appreciation before the distribution factors that in. The fund presumably started  lower and rose to the final point if  not more as people expected the distribution. Anyways it isnt like VWUSX sought out to sell things all the capital gains distributions were dividend related it looks like. Which are pretty unavoidable and for most investors not even something that should be avoided. Even if you have to pay taxes it is one of the advantaged ways to do so. Dont get me wrong it is rough in a year like this one to have to pay taxes on funds that at best stayed even but more likely closed down. Still someone had to pay that and because a lot of investors would not be benefited by the holding company paying it it is distributed.

You could say that reducing taxes on young people would help them reduce personal debt. Its a ridiculous argument why should it be a social burden to reduce personal debt?gtIn a sense we do. There are a number of deductions and credits that are available to households to mitigate their original tax obligation. Plus there is a web of state and federal programs that provide services for children such as education and health care. After school programs are also typically offered in any public school.Basically we dont tax part of the money that people spend on their children. Thats not even ballpark to the situation Im describing. Tuition is tax deductible as well I should know I worked summers to pay for school.gtAgain we already have this. Federal and state programs exist to help people keep a roof over their head the water running and their dwellings kept at a reasonable temperature.

6681462,0,t1_d0adwr3,Generally name changing or rebranding of a firm is costly. Two alleged benefits of name changes are i a name change conveys information to investors about the firms business lines or ii about its future performance. However this study  indicates that evidence fails to support the hypothesis that on average a name change increases shareholders wealth. There is some evidence that firms undertaking name changes have positive earnings growth in the three years before the changes but such growth is partly attributable to industrywide earnings growth.More recent research draw more nuanced conclusions. Some researchers Andrikopoulos et al.  find that onaverage the longterm performance of renamed firms underperformed the market. Wu  shows in essence the same effect with the reservation name changes tied to refocusing the scope of business can have positive peermatched adjusted excess returns in the long run.The dotcom bubble is quite an outlier. Stocks responded heavily to changes in names which included internet related terms. Subsequently during the dotcom crash rebranding your company to a noninternet related name had the opposite effect. If a company just changes its name without changing its business there is at best no effect and in the worst case scenario you are just destroying value by wasting money consultants designs etc and by destroying goodwill.

The real value of tech in the companies profiled is intelligencedata. You are right it has become a real buzz phrase of late and undoubtedly clever marketers took note. However One need not look further than Uber which consistently claims it is not a taxi service but a data sharing app. Yes vehicles are used but the profit is in the management and flow of data. Any corporations worth its salt is joining the datacentric train. This is not to say this was not attempted before to varying degrees of efficacy however the prevalence immediacy and applicable relevancy of said data is certainly increasing revenues if not opening new value chains for even the most conservative of companies. Think boring supply chainoriented retailers or even services like airlines etc.... This data really is unlocking value for them. They are more precise and less wasteful.

6938771,0,t1_d12tlri,I mean those links will provide more information if youre actually interested. The basic idea is that its a retirement savings plan structured with an employer. When a person starts working for a company if the company has a retirement plan that employees can contribute to then that individual can setallocate a certain percentage of their salary to automatically get deducted from their I believe pretax paycheck. That deducted dollar amount automatically gets put into a k retirement account managed by some brokerage like Fidelity. Many employers match contributions so if an employee is contributing Xmonth then the employer also adds Xmonth to that same account. Im fairly certain that all contributed money remains locked in that account and accrues interest until retirement at which point it can be withdrawn and I think taxed at that time. Pulling money out of a k before retirement triggers some sort of a penalty fee calculated as some fixed percentage of the amount being withdrawn.Im no expert in this matter but I think thats the basic idea.,investing,d12u6p7,1,t5_2qhhq

6988401,0,t1_d184k4m,Yeah the idea you have is kind of a mix between two things that already exist. One is an SPV or Special Purpose Vehicle. Often in private investments a bunch of investors will all put their money into a single LLC that exists in order to hold an investment. This allows a startup to raise a crowdfunding round without adding a ton of new investors directly to their capitalization table. Title III does not allow for SPVs though many in the industry have called for that specifically to be updated. Also there is an investment model called a Syndicate which is very popular on AngelList in which a lead investor does all the due diligence and deal making in investing in startups and a larger group of passive investors contribute funds. Many syndicates are lead by a famous investor such as Tim Ferris. Right now I think this model only exists for accredited investors. So I think you could get some people you already have substantial preexisting relationships with together do not advertise publicly via General Solicitation raise a fund together using Regulation D rule b which can include up to  nonaccredited investors and create a small fund that in turn invests in Title III Crowdfunded offerings.The downside here is I think any individual and Im not sure if this includes institutional investors are only allowed to invest up to k per year in TitleIII offerings. But if you could get some buddies together and get k together to make a little crowdfundingfund that could maybe be a pretty cool project.  I am not a Lawyer Im just spitballing here this is not real legal advice if you ever do anything like this for the love of god hire a good securities lawyer who knows the JOBS act rules inside and out. ,investing,d18h5yf,1,t5_2qhhq

So a  bond issued with a  percent coupon will yield  annually. After the bond is issued it will trade on secondary markets i.e. the exchanges. Now imagine the interest rates decline. Newly issued  have a  percent coupon rather than a  percent coupon. Would you rather own the  percent or  percent bond issue? See where you misunderstanding occurs? It would not make sense to have two bond issues all else equal yielding different rates. Why would you buy a  percent bond for  when you can also buy a  percent bond for ?

Not that dividend paying companies arent good... but paying a dividend just means that you will get back cash payments from the stock usually quarterly rather than that money being invested back into the growth of the business.With your job youre probably not going to have time to pick individual dividend stocks in a meaningful way and would be better of buying an index fund or group of funds that do the work for you.The standard advice would be to  pay down debt  Put money into your k up to the amount that your employer matches  Put money into an IRA up to   Finish putting money into k up to   Invest in passive diversified investments that minimize your loss to taxesFrom there you can buy a set of index funds or buy shares of individual companies.

Your ordinary private retirement payment is basically a gamble with the insurer if you are going to live a long life. If you pass away early you lost that gamble and paid more than you got out of it even if they have guaranteed widow payments included. If you live a long life and reach  years of age you won.All these gambles differ in their risk of loss. If I play toss a coin I have a  chance of losing all. If I invest in individual stock my risk greatly depends on my analytical skill experience and approach. Investing in blue chip stocks COULD lead to losses but the risk of losing it all is nearly . Investing in index funds minimizes the losses but a lot of opportunities are left out. Especially in early years you can gamble a bit more. You can invest in the Facebooks Teslas and Twitters of this world. Even if you lose  you still can just sit it out or catch up again.

7608731,0,t3_4ji8z9,I keep trying to wrap my head around the effects of this aging as well and it looks pretty bleak to me.  The tax base will shrink and the social safety net burdens will increase. Tax rates will go up pensions and SSI drop infrastructure will begin to deteriorate worse than we already are experiencing.  Real estate will decline precipitously both commercial and residential. Fewer people means fewer dwellings and reduced need for office space. Couple these with high home priceshigh debtslow retirement savings and you probably have families being forced to live together at a much greater rate on the residential side. As for commercial you already have reduced office demands as people work from home companies under hire to save costs and jobs continue to automate and I think this exacerbates even more.  Stock markets might struggle due to the larger agedretired population removing assets over saving them. Bonds and interest rates continue to declinestay low as people look to income over stocks. I guess this could have a reverse effect if the yield chase continues into equities and real estate. However I feel like this is a short term effect and that prices are rapidly reaching levels that make the real estate assets unattractiveunattainable. These are a few of my big theories. There are a couple caveats I have that could maybe turn these around First is immigration. Youth populations in Southern Asia and Africa are robust in the midlonger term so we might benefit from young immigrants coming here and lowering the average age. But weve got rising xenophobic rhetoric in western countries and there would be a shortmid term decline in wagesunrest due to domestic jobs going to new immigrants. Second is well everywhere kinda sucks economically and globalization has us all reliant on one another so maybe the US is the best of the worst and will benefit from being a better investment than other options out there. TLDR I dont think it looks rosy for much of the world over the midlong term but it could be played if you look for inefficiencies and pay attention to timing. Family housing senior care nondiscretionary and tech catering to the aging might be good smaller apartments office real estate discretionary stocks auto manufacturers construction etc. all might suffer. ,investing,d372n8o,10,t5_2qhhq

When horrible people let alone poorly performing people cant be fired and are hired back with back pay after months or years even though they endanger people lives and performance there are massive problems with the system.

7704041,0,t1_d3hv816,From an investors perspective it doesnt matter whats inside a CD. CDs are FDICinsured so you cant compare them to a portfolio including corporates even if the CD really has corporates inside it the government is shielding you from that risk. You can always get a higher yield on bonds by taking on credit risk. Comparing a CD to a corporate bond or a portfolio including corporate bonds is apples to oranges. It wouldnt surprise me if some of the . y banks are selling CDs as loss leaders hoping to profit off customers in other ways.Also one other benefit of CDs purchased directly from banks is that they implicitly include a call option on interest rates. You can always sell your CD back to the issuing bank by paying the early withdrawal penalty. If interest rates rise a LOT you will profit by selling your CD back to the bank since the EWP is less than the loss you would have taken on a Treasury on the open market. Then you can turn around and dump your money into a higher yielding CD.For this reason the prices of brokered CDs should be slightly higher than the prices of direct CDs because brokered CDs dont include this call option feature.,investing,d3hwce8,1,t5_2qhhq

While TFR if below replacement value there is significant and continued net immigration into the US mostly by young people. . The author mentions the potential for a rapidly increasing share of retirees to the workingage population. This is correct. However there is a more nuanced view to be made. For example not all people in the  group will retire and many will continue to work in some capacity possibly due to insufficient retirement funds. In addition when the wave of retirement hits in full this will create additional demand for workers possibly putting upward pressure on wages counter to the authors argument about wage stagnation continuing into the future. c. What about the effect of technology and productivity growth? What the author calls a bubble can at least partially be explained by rapid technological advancement leading to optimistic expectations about the future and higher PE ratios etc. ,investing,d3qabvc,18,t5_2qhhq

7873676,0,t1_d411gh6,gt I think youre saying theres not enough borrowers for all that cash. But if the economy heats up wont there become more borrowers and then the excess reserves starts making its way to the money in circulation?In theory yes but theres a lot of people that would argue bank lending isnt really limited by reserve requirements anyways specifically because the Federal Reserve and overnight borrowing exist in the first place.  The real limitation is the rates on those types of borrowing and the Fed has good tools to control those rates.gt A very salient point. Thanks. So to walk through the dynamics... by buying up treasuries and MBS they increase the demand and thus the price. So the bond equivalent yields all dropped for the longer term treasuries inverse priceyield relationship?Pretty much primary dealers know they can always sell to the Fed and are the ones buying securities at auctions so higher prices bid down interest rates.gt Why is there this whole conversation of Will we be Zimbabwe or will we be Japan? Is the end game really that dichotomous? It sounds like the fed can throttle back the economy by just selling off the MBS assets and cooling off the money supply?Because gt of people really have no idea what QE is how its implemented or what the Fed does.  Most of these arguments originate from ideological arguments against the very existence of the Fed as a central bank or the whole concept of fiat currency.  The analogy of printing money plays better that actually going through the whole process of reserves and lending since its simpler and easier to understand.  In a certain way its kind of odd given the prevalence of credit cards and so forth if you think about it most people out there probably create a certain amount of money each and every month temporarily just by borrowing on their credit card and then destroy it when they pay it back off in almost the exact same fashion that banks do its just smaller sums with a shorter duration.

There is so much wrong in what you are saying its comical. Numerous opportunities to make ? There are opportunities to make  EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.

Advisors dont have inside information most adhere to the age old theory of diversification sector rotation and limiting your downside capture ratio on a portfolio. uAndIHaveMilesToGo Please for the love of god do not listen to this guy. What it sounds like the advisor has done is put you into a number of diversified mutual funds that have been performing maybe slightly worse than the market has since its been invested. The advisor is not a crook. Although with the asset level you are at its probably not worth it to be paying fees. You could buy the same funds you are in and not pay the advisory fee.

7906324,0,t1_d44g275,I prefer spreadbetting as its free from stamp duty and capital gains tax as long as its not your sole source of income. CFDs are subject to capital gains and both are normally provided by the same sort of broker so theres really not much underlying difference between how the two actually operate. If my spreadbet broker requires a large minimum margin or the stock is something that should really not be traded without any leverage then I will normally just buy physical stocks. For the stocks that provide a dividend and not have a great deal of volatility I will use a little leverage .  . This is much lower leverage than most use on these sort of accounts but this is mainly because I trade long time frames. Another advantage spreadbetting has over CFDs and trading physical stocks is that youre not exposing yourself to currency fluctuations when trading international stocks and theres no currency exchange fees. This is a benefit that I think often gets overlooked. These brokers can control the spread. Normally its increased when theres an increase in volatility. They normally only mirror your trade in the market when they have too much exposed risk although some brokers will automatically hedge meaning the broker isnt exposed to gainslosses from your trade. They do this because most traders loose money by over trading or trading on too much leverage. If you are consistently profitable for a long time they will usually categorize you differently and forward all your trades to the market. According to London capital group the average trade duration is  minutes which I think is crazy but you can see why most loose money.A lot of the issues traders complain about are associated with them trading on a lot of leverage on small time frames so my advice would be to use apropriate leverage no more than  have a decently funded account and trade longer timeframes on major markets and large cap stocks.,investing,d44qv8x,2,t5_2qhhq

I think Questrade lets you buy index ETFs without commission. For  you would need to look at the MER fees of each index fund you intend to purchase.   For example  Here are some low cost index funds from Vanguard Canada.  See the MER column?  That is the annual cost you pay. VCN for example is . per year.  Compare that with Mutual Funds sold by your Financial Advisors at Canadian Banks most of them have MERs between . and ..  If you are a novice then you should stick with something like VCN.TO or XIC.TO There are many other index funds that are not low cost and or that may have risks that you do not understand. ,investing,d4bwq8k,2,t5_2qhhq

Interest rates are well below historical averages which has helped increase bond prices due to their inverse relationship with interest rates.But for real estate low interest rates have done something else its effectively increased the buying power of new home owners. When interest rates were  a   year mortgage would have a  monthly payment attached to it. That monthly payment is ultimately what determines if a house is affordable to a home buyer. So what happens when interest rates go down to . and a home buyer can still afford to pay  per month? If we flip the calculation suddenly this person can buy a  house.

Investors follow three rules research the company as if you were buying the entire business bc essentially you are buying a chunk of it minimize risks using margin of safety or diversification and hope for adequate not extraordinary results.

People forget because the prices are so close together most of the time but they really are two different prices.Whenever someone buys a stock the ask price increases.Whenever someone sells a stock the bid price decreases.Thats it really. When the bidask spread starts to increase eventually someone will blink and jump the gap. Either sellers will lower the bid price so that people will actually buy the stock or buyers will raise the ask price so that people will actually sell the stock to them.Because there are thousands of traders doing this throughout the day the bidask spread is usually very close. But in times of crisis the bidask spread will diverge.All of the earnings  economy  stuff is more important for predicting dividends or whether or not a company will go bankrupt.

8142537,0,t1_d4vabxz,My view is thisWhen you have a move in a stock like ABX that is up  YTD or AG up  Im not interested in buying from the standpoint of I feel like buying is chasing a move and being very much late to the party.  This is heightened when it comes to something like miners which are basically more or less a leveraged play on metals and if it turned the other way that could result in real problems. Miners have absolutely been the place to be this year but look at most of them over the past few  when gold wasnt doing well miners were doing abysmally badly. My other issue with miners is the idea that all manner of things can come out of left field and cause problems with miners during otherwise fine times for gold this is especially true when you are dealing with smaller companies.So to summarize . I personally look at a stock up nearly  or  in a manner of  months as having missed the move and I dont want to chase that. I may wind up being wrong but Im okay with that.. If the Brexit situation gets worse andor you have problems in Europe then you may have another push higher in gold and another push higher in miners.. The market is already nearly back to where it was preBrexit. If volatility and distress over the implications of the situation cool further you could get a pullback in gold and a material pullback in miners that have already soared this year.Personally I have no desire to chase miners and really am looking for things that I can feel more comfortable about for the longterm rather than miners that can absolutely soar one year and be in the toilet in the next. If you are buying miners here you have to believe that there is going to be further political and economic distress in the nearterm. That very well may be the case but Im not willing to make that bet. Good luck to you if you do.,investing,d4vd2bh,1,t5_2qhhq

If we dont pay for their preventative care then theyll show up at emergency rooms and default on their medical debt which hospitals will make up for by increasing their prices for medical services across the board. Youre subsidizing them whether you like it or not and at the end of the day its simply cheaper to subsidize routine preventative care to minimize the amount of more expensive care they need if they cant afford to get checkups. Keep in mind of course that healthcare was just one example of basic things that everyone needs.

I think that says enough.Edit  Oof... jesus...The latest victims of negative interest rates and the crashing value of bonds are the Italian banks which until recently boasted of their good health. Even the German giant Deutsche Bank has begun to suffer at least partly due to low and negative rates.That is so laughably stupidly wrong its hard to know what to say.  Italian banks woes have absolutely zilch to do with the crashing value of bonds which in itself is a laughably wrong statement.  Italian banks have so many nonperforming loans its absolutely astounding.  Deutsche Banks problems also have nothing to do with low rates.  Their profitability is certainly impacted by low or negative rates.  But thats not why everyone is concerned with DB.  No one is worried about DB losing a couple billion euros a year.  Their concern is because DB is still massively leveraged and fails pretty dramatically several stress test components.  They are severely undercapitalized and any structural problems that threaten to take out DB will quickly take out a bunch of other banks and cause severe chaos and damage to all the major ones.  US banks spent the last  or  years cleaning up their derivative exposure deleveraging and strengthening their capital base.  DB hasnt done much and was pretty late to the game in starting.  Brexit has just seriously heightened fears around DBs current situation.,investing,d5hvxd9,2,t5_2qhhq

I assume a Vanguard account does that for Vanguard ETFs and many other brokerages but not all offer that for Vanguard ETFs.    Automatic reinvestment of dividends in a mutual fund looks about the same to the customer but is different from the point of view of the brokerage because it is done by the fund management company rather than the brokerage.  If you have Vanguard funds in a Vanguard account the distinction between fund company and brokerage is subtle.    Where do you plan to open the account?

8356158,0,t1_d5lwja5,Ive been trying to explain this but its a difficult concept and I dont think I am doing it justice. If you were to search options expected move you would definitely get a better understanding.To start off there are two types of options contracts. You have put options and call options. To make it as simple as possible if you thought a stock would go up you would buy call options and if you thought a stock would go down you would buy put options. A lot goes into option pricing but a key component of the price is the risk. Lets say chipotle is at . There are formulas people have derived to calculate the expected move  based off of past and current trends and what not  but for the sake of this lets say the expected move for the week was  . This means at the end of the week chipotle would be expected to be within  to . More often then not the expected move is overstated. It doesnt simply mean it should be at  however. If if was bullish I could buy a  call. The expected move on the positive side is  so this would not be an unreasonable purchase. I could also buy a  call. The  call would be more expensive than the  call because it has a higher probability of being in the money  having worth at expiration . What I am trying to point out is that pricing follows a roughly normal distribution. Of course as you mentioned more people probably thought Chipotle would miss so there would be some skew to the distribution. You can imagine  being the first standard deviation of the distribution curve. Earnings are binary event. As much as one would like to say they knew X would beat earnings the reality is its . As it gets closer to the earnings event stocks get more volatile  have bigger price changes. As an example NFLXs earnings event in April dropped them  or so and then they dropped  during this weeks earnings. When I had said options were pricing in an X move it meant that after earnings investors thought the stock would be withing that  range. In the case of Netflix investors had priced the expected move at   but instead the  loss meant a  change   outside the expected move. On the other hand AMD had an expected move of  . and instead moved only half  of course tomorrow could change the numbers . The end goal here is explain that people believe chipotle would have a big move   updown . Currently it hasnt moved much. If chipotle were to continue this habit of not moving you would see chipotles expected move decline for future earnings  assuming all other things remain equal .Hope that helps?,investing,d5m2m6i,1,t5_2qhhq

8398441,0,t3_4ulf9t,XIV ETF a daily rebalancing volatility futures strategy. It basically sells other investors insurance against market volatility. It does that by selling shortdated volatility futures and buying the long end of the curve. One study I read said it has had .x or higher leverage on the SampP  Varies due to daily rolling futures. The price can move    in a day so I limit the allocation to about  of my portfolio. When I am up by  I reduce exposure. Ive been down  for short periods and expect that to happen over and over again.... Would not recommend more than a few percentage points allocation and would advise against long holding periods. My theory for why this works hedging equity downside is extremely costly and certain derivatives markets such as equity puts and calls are inherently skewed toward hedging demand so people who are willing to supply hedges are compensated.,investing,d5rco6e,1,t5_2qhhq

8403917,0,t1_d5rynw4,I think I understand which problem you are hypothesizing  That is net trading losses from outflows during low liquidity.  But you have linked together ETFs and mutual funds despite those having totally different response to such conditions.    Ignoring whether the underlying assumptions of the event are really plausible.  Just pretending they are plausible.  In that event the type of losses created by those who sell the mutual fund are distributed across all those who held the fund including those who didnt sell.  But the same kind of loses in an ETF are limited to those who actually sold and do not affect those who continued to hold.    In an ETF those losses are tied tightly together with a more common type of panic sale losses in ETFs  Normally ETF shares trade very close to NAV.  But when the underlying shares have low liquidity that has a magnified effect on the ETF shares so the ETF shares have even lower liquidity because arbitrage dealers are forced to back away by the high risks of low liquidity.  So when the underlying shares plunge the ETF shares normally plunge faster.  So anyone selling ETF shares during the panic gets well under the NAV of that moment.    So far as I understand the mechanics of a mass outflow in an ETF are  A An arbitrage dealer buys ETF shares while selling short the underlying securities.  B Then exchanges the ETF shares for the underlying shares and uses those to resolve the shorts.  As long as the portfolio mix of the EFT is moderately stable an index rather than active ETF there is no delay risk in the time between A and B.  If there are no liquidity problem then the two halves of A can be effectively simultaneous.  With liquidity problems the two halves of A are less simultaneous so the dealer needs the ETF price to drop further below the NAV in order to make the whole process work.  Through it all the ETF manager had no problem because he just provides shares of the underlying in return for retiring shares of the ETF all in the less time sensitive B step.    So far as I understand the mechanics of a mass outflow in a mutual fund are  A During trading the fund accumulates net redemption orders for far more cash than the fund has.  B Still during trading the fund manager liquidates shares to raise cash selling into a non liquid market.  C At market close the underlying shares can be expected to be valued above the proceeds of the non liquid sales in B so the NAV is computed at a value lower than it would have been if those sales had not occurred.  D Those selling get cashed out at that lower NAV but those holding also own assets at the same lower NAV.  If Im getting all that right the need to provide cash to those exiting the fund forces the fund to temporarily switch its asset mix from the defined index to a higher fraction cash.  Then it is switched back to the defined mix automatically by the exit itself.  But the market loss created by the original switch remains.,investing,d5s1aag,3,t5_2qhhq

If they sell an iPhone to someone in Germany that profit is still foreign profit and will remain offshore and untaxed by the US until its repatriated into the US. In this hypothetical scenario it would not be transferred to Ireland and therefore it would be taxed by Germany and they would get a credit for it against their US taxes if they were to repatriate it.,investing,d6k4nix,2,t5_2qhhq

It will depend on assets as you mentioned on what type of bankruptcy is being filed what kind of debt the company has and how their debt is allocated. A Chapter  may not affect bondholders much they will not receive interest or principal payments causing a default. They may be offered new bonds stock in the company cash or a combination of those things. Bondholders are able to sell the bonds on the open market normally during this process. They should in theory not be too greatly affected by a Chapter  bankruptcy. A Chapter  bankruptcy though is going to have a much large impact on bondholders. How much they are paid or how badly they are affected will depend on what company assets can be liquidated what equity is on hand how much secured debt the company is required to pay off along with other expenses that may arise during the bankruptcy process.,investing,d7c5b7a,1,t5_2qhhq

9229224,0,t3_56jbpg,Any reason to invest? Of course theres a reason. The difference between investing and gambling is that investing has positive expected value over time while gambling usually has a defined negative expected value or an expected value that is extremely difficult to discern in the nearterm. For returns above the riskfree rate that is in excess of the interest rate you could obtain by taking no risk of principal loss at all usually defined as some government bond rate but which for an individual without too much money is probably more closely approximated by the interest rate you could obtain in a savings account  i.e. nothing you will bear risk of principal loss. There is no way at all of avoiding that risk. However what you might not be considering is that your personal liabilities grow at a rate that is likely in excess of that which you can obtain by parking money in a savings account. So in not investing you are essentially making a bet that inflation will be flat or negative and given that the entire goal of most developed world monetary policy is either to push asset prices higher and inflation to  and to encourage growth in GDP youre making a strongly negative trade in the nearterm. If you want to counteract these effects you will have to invest and not be scared off by moments when your portfolio goes negative. Again positive expected value in the long run is what you are after. Hedge funds are a completely disparate group of investment strategies and are really not appropriately grouped together in my view. Many have strategies that are completely different from one another and perhaps most importantly benchmarking their performance against that of the SampP  is almost universally inappropriate. If the fund youre looking at is marketneutral well the right comparison is then the riskfree rate not the SampP . The reason you invest in hedge funds is for a chance that your returns will be abovenormal relative to the riskfree rate  and possibly relative to the SampP  and importantly to minimize the volatility in your overall portfolio. ,investing,d8lve9f,1,t5_2qhhq

It has a box to type any extra instructions to be passed along to the charity.  You can also elect to have your donation made anonymously or specify that it was directed by you.. You can manage your DAF a little.  I have a choice of four funds.  They are listed here  only the asset allocation pools Im not sure what the others are for..  I cant buy individual stocks.  If you transfer stocks to your DAF it gets immediately sold and put into one of the four funds.. The interface is really easy for distributing funds to charities.  The first time you donate to a charity it might be tough to find especially for small charities.  Second donations are easy you just click a donate again button..  I know they send a check to small charities like the local school.  Bigger charities might have EFT set up but Ive never seen any extra charges.If you have any highly appreciated stockoptions I would really recommend opening a DAF.  I think Schwabs minimum is only  to open.  It allows you to take the tax deduction right away and then spread out your donations.

If a fund instead used very long term contracts and rolled them monthly quarterly or annually then slippage would be reduced.

If the transcripts reference market share theres a good chance theyre looking at units and not revenues.If they are referencing revenue share you have to be careful about what revenue numbers youre using in the calculation. Theres a good chance the revenue numbers your adding up include revenues from products outside the definition of the market youre looking at.Generally Its really uncommon for an industry to have all the necessary information publicly available to calculate unit or revenue share. It happens but its rare. A lot of the times you need numbers from companies that arent public or maybe the players group revenue in segments to broad to directly calculate the market share. Usually you only find this in expensive consultant reports. Sometimes you can get lucky and therell be information available that you can find from a google search. Just be specific about the market definition and type that in along with market share. ,investing,daipyeg,2,t5_2qhhq

When the market fluctuates down it takes the steady earners with them. This doesnt reflect on the company in any way but it takes a market dive out of the equation. Either the market recovers and you make out well or the market never recovers and you bought a steady earner when the market was already at a low.

Housing isnt unique here.For the last  years bond yields have been significantly lower than their price appreciation except since Nov. Now theyre dropping and will continue to drop. As willhas SFBA housing. The differences between the two asset classes are not trivial as supplydemand is different for bonds but rents on housing are constrained by median incomes for the area. As we can see from the previous  months in SF the rent increases have slowed dramatically whereas bond returns are dependent on taxes which can be increased.Plus bonds are very cheap to sell compared to houses. This will tend to slow the price discovery in housing so the price drop could have happened and folks are not aware yet. ,investing,dbe879b,1,t5_2qhhq

10206495,0,t1_dc0tmp0,Youre very welcome I hope I can be helpful. Basically but it does depend on how you underweight it. For example you could say I dont really want to deal with all bonds Ill be a bit riskier and get high yields instead of BND. Youd be hoping that the high yield fund would outperform BND in the long run but since it didnt affect your weight for the other three funds it wouldnt mess with that. Likewise you could underweight international stocks and use the extra weight between REITs and defense stocks I do both of these things  youd be betting that REITs and defense stocks outperform internationals. All of these things increase your risk in hopes of a reward but it of course doesnt have to be that way. In that case you might consider having your IRA be a higher weight in bonds if youd like to have more of an assurance that your IRA principal is safer and you can take the extra risk with the options trades. ,investing,dc0yoqa,2,t5_2qhhq

10219832,0,t1_dc1uvdb,I have to laugh when I see this post downvoted. This is part of how you manage portfolio risk and it works. I started learning about the market when I was  and started trading when I was . I had my ups and downs but when I lost money on a trade I analyzed it to see what I did wrong.  Sometimes it was hard to tell at first but after a while I saw the things I did that resulted in a loss and vowed to stop doing them. Over time I did better not because I became a better stock picker but because I was controlling my losses. I avoided being a pig and chasing stocks only to be in at the top and go down with the decline. I take some off the table after a big run in a short time. When the gains are unsustainable I sell. When I buy I dont buy all at once. I buy some and wait for it to drop down more scaling my buys with volatility. If the stock turns and goes up before I get a full position on I tip my hat and say Ill wait for a pullback and consider it. I learned to understand how different asset classes work and the relationships between them. I look for whats working in the market and stay away from whats not. Thats only part of what I do to improve my chances of making money and lessen my chances of losing money I do much more and the result is I beat the SampP most of the time. And when what are now uncommon occurrences do happen I look for what I did wrong just as I always have. ,investing,dc2h4n7,1,t5_2qhhq

Much like how having a fitness instructor coach or dietitian can lookup the same workouts calorie counts and techniques that you can it doesnt mean that they cant be extremely helpful. I think that the personal role that the FA serves will be one of the last to be tapped by technology.  ,investing,dc87wjw,25,t5_2qhhq

But that was a special exception.  The media were loyal Democrats for FDR Truman JFK and every other Democrat administration since with that sole exception of Johnson.

10335092,0,t1_dcfhck1,Your point about CFDs carrying counterparty risk is definitely legitimate. They are not in fact banned in the US but since theyre considered to be a form of a swap contract access to them is restricted to eligible contract participants a definition which excludes most retail investors. Whether or not that is right is a slightly more subtle point. In the right hands of a responsible DMA broker and with conservative leverage CFDs can be a fantastic instrument that provides retail investors with a uniform interface to both shares ETFs index futures and commodity futures and abstracts away the subtleties involved in trading each type of underlying.Some instruments including many commodity and index futures contracts also trade at notional amounts far larger than most retail investors would be comfortable with. A CFD broker can split a single future contract into multiple smaller CFDs allowing retail investors to access this market in more reasonable slices. A broker might also transparently handle rollovers or include some form of a builtin hedge such as a guaranteed stoploss into the contract in order to eliminate the risk of an investor losing more than their total deposit. Some issuers successfully do this in the form of commodity ETNs while introducing themselves as a counterparty with all associated risk in the process and these products including leveraged variants at up to x leverage are actively traded on US markets and are widely available to retail investors.In the wrong hands however a market maker concerned primarily with its own profitability instead of the best interest of investors high leverage and cumbersome terms of service can indeed cause considerable harm to retail investors. The problem thus might be not be the product itself but the manners in which less reputable brokers choose to profit from it.,investing,dcfjgwy,2,t5_2qhhq

10371033,0,t3_5ohook,Hey everyone I have a basic plan for my inheritance detailed below but would very much appreciate any advice you folks may be able to offer in investingspending it differently. My primary goal is to make up for a late start in building my k and savegrow what I can for the future. I recently inherited  from a life insurance payout and  from my mothers k. My understanding is that life insurance policies arent taxed so the k should be cut and dry. I would like to roll the k over into mine but from what I have been able to research it appears that isnt an option. My options appear to be Take it in a lump sum pay a higher income tax rate this year but have the cash available to invest elsewhere Take minimal payments from Fidelity that are still taxed but do not raise my tax bracket and do not earn interestAny recommendations on which is the better choice?With the k I plan to Paying off my car   Pay off k in miscellaneous debt. not high interest but it is to family so I would like to be rid of it Retain k in a safety net. I am not sure the best way to do this. I am told I shouldnt keep more than a few thousand in my checking account due to minimal interest growth but the savings account my credit union offers the same interest as my checking account so I dont see the purpose in using it Open an IRA account and deposit the max allowed amount of  to cover  would it make more sense to invest this in a mutual fund instead? Invest the remaining amount in a mutual fund Vanguard certainly seems to be the preferred choice but I do not know which to select just yetHow old are you? Are you employedmaking income? How much?  plus a company vehicle cell phone and expense account that covers the majority of my food budget I work in an industry that requires me to eat out for most of my meals.What are your objectives with this money? buy a house? Retirement savings? Save for the futureretirement. I may be relocated to another city for work soon so I would like to continue renting for now. In a year or so when I am more settled I may want to use a portion or all of the inheritance for a down payment to purchase a home.What is your risk tolerance? Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its  safe? I am fairly risk tolerant.What are your current holdings? Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? I have k in my checking account and k in my in my k. Currently I deposit  with a company match of  but plan on upping to the max allowed . The bulk of my k just shy of  years old comes from profit sharing that the company I work for offers.  Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? not really an asset Just the car I am about to pay off. I would sell it as my company provides a company car in my current role but the promotion I am up for does not include a company vehicle. If I sell now I will lose a couple thousand on the car vs. what I owe so I am going to wait until I know if the new role is going to happen or not.What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next yrs? The only reason I would need to access the funds would be to use as a down payment if I purchase a home. Any big debts? I recently paid off some old debt from when I was young stupid so now just the k mentioned above to family. Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. My only significant expense is my rent at  a month roughly half my net monthly income not including bonuses. I realize this is excessive given my income but it is worth it to me as I need to live downtown for my current occupation and spend a good amount of time working from home.,investing,dcjma06,2,t5_2qhhq

10634297,0,t3_5s5wlh,No. I shop there but no interest in investing in it. For me I think the next  years will see very significant change in retail including real deterioration in the mall business. Target and other names can certainly bounce but any sort of longerterm Id rather focus on investing in ecommerce or things associated with it. Target and others certainly have their ecommerce side but the negatives for the giant B amp M legacy businesses are far outweighing any positives on the online side. If Im Target and Im trying to grow the online business and get customers buying more online thats purchases that they arent making in the store. The stores that cost a lot to open every day. Too many problems with a main one being how do they fix the issues they have with grocery  which is a large part of the business and still problematic. Their electronics section is unappealing   Q was not very good which included a decline in electronics sales in the high single digit . People are ordering electronics online or going to Best Buy. The CVS transition for pharmacy operations didnt go very smoothly but I think over time thats something that will probably work itself out.Cartwheel is a great app  and really probably the best app a major retailer has created that Ive seen  but I dont think Ive ever seen anyone but me actually use it and the number of times offers have been redeemed that are listed on the app seem awfully low for a chain the size of Target. For those who have never used Cartwheel its actually a welldesigned app that offers tons  usually of offers on various products and sometimes broader categories. You click on the things that interest you and when you check out you bring up a barcode on your phone that barcode is scanned once and the discounts that you have selected are taken off all at once if youve purchased those products. You start off being able to add a certain amount of offers. As you use Cartwheel more the max amount of offers you can add goes up.Online is going rather well but that is a small part of the overall business and its not only the idea that more transactions are moving online but there are real store issues here. I dont really know how they fix grocery problems in a meaningful way and Im not sure they quite do either as this has been a problem for a while now and perhaps even since they started with grocery really. Targets grocery store has never been enough of a grocery for people to make it their grocery destination. As such it has not gotten enough traffic and theyve had problems with food spoiling. The stores do need an update as well the failure of the Canadian expansion was a distraction when the effort should have been towards updating stores. I go to Target because prices are actually quite reasonable and Cartwheels additional discounts of at times up to  off on already good prices makes for good deals and one can frequently find really good clearance deals. Im going there for basics and occasionally something else if theres a deal. Otherwise if I look at much of the store Id rather order it on Amazon. Im not buying electronics at Target. But in a world where retailers have to up presentation and really carefully curate their product selection to get people into the store rather than just ordering something on Amazon on their phone when theyre taking a crap  Targets just not doing that. The look of the stores really hasnt changed that much and it needs to theres just nothing very engaging about the presentation at Target. Some sections at Target could be lessened entirely theres so much space being devoted to physical books movies and music  I cant imagine that real estate in the store is performing well enough to justify it. Target actually had decent success with clothing for a while but now whats on offer is largely generic and forgettable. You have to give people a bold reason to go to the store.Target has also given up on two large innovative projects So I think the question becomes having to make some difficult choices on where the focus is for the future of the business and really how to prioritize going forward.  Target and these legacy retail businesses almost need an Elon Musklike figure that has a vision and that can take chances. For the last decade or so B amp M retail has been all about not taking chances and hoping that Amazon would just go away somehow.Lastly Ive noted this before and Ill put it again here I completely agree with what Howard Schultz said on a conference call late last year.But I think theres another issue on the table that we have not yet discussed that I talked about three years ago and that is the seismic shift in consumer traffic.I was talking to Fred Smith just a couple of weeks ago about his situation at FedEx and he shared with me a piece of research which showed a significant drop in foot traffic on Main Street and in malls not only domestically and around the world as a result of ecommerce the Web and what Ill loosely describe as the Amazon effect. As a result of that youre certainly seeing large companies and small companies not only not open new stores but announce closures.And let me just speak to that. I know this is a little longwinded but I think its important. Theres no doubt that over the next five years or so we are going to see a dramatic level of retailers not be able to sustain their level of core business as a traditional bricksandmortar retailer and their omnichannel approach is not going to be sustainable to maintain their cost of their infrastructure. And as a result of that theres going to be tremendous amount of changes with regard to the retail landscape.We believe as we look down that pipe and look at the future that our ability to maintain our growth in terms of new stores domestically and internationally coupled with the fact that Starbucks still maintains a very special place in terms of a sense of community the third place environment and people looking for and seeking out human contact and a place to go that as these store closures occur and they will that we are going to be in a very unique position five years  years down the road because theres going to be a lot less people competing for those customers. Im not talking about the coffee category Im talking overall.But we are in the very very early stages of a tremendous change in the bricksandmortar footprint of retailers domestically and internationally as a result of the sea change in how people are buying things and thats going to have I think a negative effect on all of retail. But we believe that its going to have ultimately a positive effect on the position that we occupy and the environment that we create in our stores.,investing,ddcuhr4,15,t5_2qhhq

10877628,0,t1_de1xcdh,gt Since you never liquidate a profitable company the government can control the entity off balance sheet forever. Nice loophole for the government.gt The distinction between a receiver and a conservator actually provides the safeguard against government abuse of conservator powers. Assuming control of a regulated entity through but being unable to siphon the assets fiduciary duty to conserve assets from the entity makes assuming control for nefarious purposes pointless. This decision actually throws  years of FDIC conservatorship case law in the garbage.Again there are specific terms outlined for the GSEs specifically here by statute here that dictate the conditions of conservatorship role of the conservator and the conditions for removing a company from that status.  It isnt your standard conservatorship and never was.  Im not saying that makes a ton of sense or that it isnt a huge oversight for a company to just sit in conservatorship like this.  Theres a good case to be made based on the prior precedent you described and the letter of the law that the GSEs were never intended to sit in conservatorship in this matter.  Of course none of that matter in this instance because thats not what the suit was trying to argue.  Its possible another suit against the FHFA or its director could come along with a specific argument that they have failed to come up with a necessary plan for actually dealing with the GSEs longer term and force them to either propose one or move the companies into receivership.  Also keep in mind the specific definition of the word conserve and its emphasis on preservation.  Theres still a good argument to be made that shareholder equity was totally worthless prior to conservatorship and the only obligation the government actually had was to preserve that value and honor their contractual obligations giving a lot of leeway to implement something like the NWS at the expense of common stock holders.gt For which companies can the government NOT write a law that establishes some regulatory body that asserts the power to put members of its regulated industries into conservatorship. Please cite the law. The SEC regulates all publicly traded companies. MSHA regulates all mines. The FDA regulates all dairies and processed food plants as well as drugs and medicine producers.gt Note that the regulator gets to determine what capital requirements are necessary and how your accounting must be performed and what the threshold is for being in danger of imminent default necessitating conservatorship.The government has the ability to change laws and Im not arguing that its just in most cases existing laws dont offer the same kind of executive discretion on behalf of an agency director that the FHFA had with the GSEs and the very specific clauses about assumption of shareholder rights.  Could that change?  Sure keep in mind theres almost nothing saying the government cant make any law it wants the courts just have the ability to throw it out after the fact or dictate its interpretation and application.,investing,de1y7ju,3,t5_2qhhq

Yes inflation would increase nominal profits but that isnt really a useful way of looking at things. Virtually always actors on the market are interested in real profit which is to say inflation adjusted if you dont know what that means yet because what we actually care about is our purchasing power. Remember a rational actor will only forgo current consumption IE save and invest in order to reap a future benefit. The correct way of valuing the return on a farm purchased in  for  would be to discount the  to  dollars and then figure the return. gt What I am saying is... arent investments safe from inflation since they increase at a similar pace as inflation? Investopedia had this topic too.As a rule of thumb investments are typically safer from inflation than cash but it isnt that simple. For example it is possible for common stock or the market to underperform inflation it just isnt what we typically expect. Furthermore other securities like bonds are priced basedoff expected inflation partially if this changes they can easily perform worse than cash money markets.Edit previously said cash obviously wrong. ,investing,de2g5ws,3,t5_2qhhq

A large cheese pizza costs about . in material and because of economies of scale the total COGS labor included is somewhere south of a dollar.  Dominos is killing the game with efficiency and volume sales.  It adds up extremely quickly.  Also if you ever stop in to a dominos take a look at the size of their ovens.  They take up about  the space of a normal pizza oven and all turnover pizza quicker.  Coupled with the fact that they push carryout and delivery orders as opposed to eat in you can put a dominos into a much smaller retail space than most any other food establishments.

10979899,0,t3_5wrrp4,I have been thinking about this a lot lately. What will the world be like  years in the future? What industries and emerging technologies will influence the trajectory of the global economy in the next decade? Its fun to think about the macro trends. Of course the hard part is identifying the individual companies to invest in. Might be smarter to go with sector ETFs where applicable. Here are some of my thoughts on the big picture trends and some companies that might be related. These are not recommendations as I have done no due diligence on any names mentioned and some of them arent publicly traded currently. Just highlevel thoughts and things I will be looking out for.. Autonomous vehicle technology for passenger cars freight trucksbig rigs specialized construction machines trains and all the related necessary infrastructure like smart roads revolutionary parkingvehicle storage solutions. Uber Google Nissan Ford GM Komatsu Daimler Tesla other automotive manufacturers. GPS technology companies chip makers component makers. NVDA AMD INTC QCOM.. Energy infrastructure. Manure digesters wind power solar energy battery technology light railother electric mass transit.. Web infrastructure. Verizon Google Fiber ATampT which has discovered a way to deliver broadband over electrical wires.. Virtualaugmented reality. FacebookOculus Sony PSVR Google. Marijuana. Likely to become legal and heavily regulated nationwideworldwide. Canadian companies traded on the TSX have been on a massive run the past  months because that country is moving toward full legalization. They may have an edge when it comes to global expansion. Also companies in related industries. Lighting hydroponics Leafly Weedmaps amp other yelplike or social mediastyle outfits companies that use other parts of the plant for other purposes and of course pharmaceutical amp biotech companies.. Real Estate related to the aging population in the US and the wave of millenial homebuyers. Target specific markets where there is arbitrage opportunity. Would need to research demographic trends to find out which areas of the country to target. For the olds Retirement communities assisted living facilities. Homes designed to accommodate multigenerational living arrangements  inlaw suites or guest houses separate private entrances two kitchens. For the millenials mixeduse development suburban single family homes close to mass transit with  minute commute to major city. . Medicalindustrial complex also related to the aging population and the wave of millenials having children. Pharma companies cancer therapies everyone gets cancer eventually holistic care hospice care child care electronic medical records insurance providers accounting software database management software.. D printing and precision manufacturingindustrial robotics. This industry has high barriers to entry and some very specialized applications but someone smarter than I will figure out a way to make a cheap D printer that produces highquality merchandise and it could revolutionize not just manufacturing but also retail because of the amount of things we could make ourselves and not have to buy. Just download a template to your household D printer and construct it. Boston Dynamics is one nonpublic company that comes to mind that I will be watching closely.. Climate change. This one is longer term not really  years out. The next generation will probably experience sea level rise that could be catastrophic to lowlying coastal places like Miami or Boston where there is a high concentration of wealth and property on the waters edge. Not sure how to take advantage of that. Maybe target real estate in neighborhoods slightly farther inland or nearby cities that may experience an influx of residents fleeing the encroaching waters. Identify technologies that will help mitigate the effects of climate change. Renewablesustainable energy sources carbon storageconversion technology leveeseawall technology?

Or for what ever reason.  The last argument we go into was whether he should put his house in a an LLC with his rental properties.  I told him that I have analyzed hundreds of real estate investors from people with  property people with thousands and I had never seen someone do that. I pulled up about  articles talking about how the IRS will not let you deduct expenses other than interest and RE taxes and I explained that this would possibly put his home at risk he would lose his owner occupied tax deduction lose his capital gains exemption and still it wouldnt really help him get a loan that he wouldnt otherwise qualify for. He argued with everything I said or showed him like I was trying to shit all over his plan. I was wrong he was right no facts could change that.  Its like he asks me things only for validation not insight. Well he as far as I know never went through with it.

If theres only  active seller on the market and hes asking  thats the price I have to accept there arent other active players doing their own math to see if its profitable for them to offer their stock for less. If I take it my trade moves the market by   times as much as it would have in a liquid market. The price impact of one person trading in an illiquid market might be the same as many active traders trading in an active market.Fundamentally theres some equilibrium point between the two extremes. If a trader can make . every time they trade a single share of stock lots of people will flock in to do the same thing reducing the profit until it reaches a point where the profit is too low leading active players out of the market. Recently the cost to be passive has been decreasing at an extreme rate making it less and less profitable to be active likely driving down the long term equilibrium. But that doesnt mean the equilibrium is  passive and  active.,investing,derc7ym,5,t5_2qhhq

Also  typically when someone is a specialist in a field they have a bit more insight into that fields future than a fortune teller.  These kinds of remarks scream to me that you just dont trust the opinions of people more informed than you in certain spaces.  Im not saying take what I say for granted but you dismiss it as if Im just any other guy giving you my opinion.  Im not.  Im more informed than the vast majority of people with opinions on both these matters and Id like to think the credentials I provided you with earlier indicate this.    Making informed decisions about the future based on experiences is kind of a big deal.  I am informed on the matter of automation.  You are not.  You are saying that automation has been happening for thousands of years and the consequences have never been dire.  Im telling you you dont know what automation is if thats what you think has been going on for thousands of years.  Again Ill emphasize I am an automation engineer.  I worked for the top tech companies in the world.  Im well credentialed to have a strong and informed opinion in this field.Your perspective is incredibly short cited.  People arent losing jobs due to automation now so why is there any concern for it in the future.  First off people are losing jobs to automation its just a very small rate. However there is this thing called Moores law.  How do you think multibillion dollar companies get caught with their pants down when technology advances?  Its because technological advances are slow until they are not.  Automation has been seeping into all aspects of life slowly but surely.  And during that time it has been improving. A lot.  Development is easier implementation is easier and the capabilities are much more extensive.  We are on the cusp of being able to replace obscene amounts of human labor. All this said I understand you probably think I am incredibly bias and have an agenda.  All good I feel you.  How about this so that we arent repeating stuff ad nauseam Im going to post a video that really explains things well using excellent metaphors I could never have come up with.  At the very least its incredibly informative and may clarify some things for you even if it doesnt convince you of whats coming.  In exchange Id love for you to provide me with a video or source material that paints the counterpoint to my worry regarding automation.

When you look back at how that economy was replaced by a manufacturing based economy but still able to grow enough food to feed everyone you dont and shouldnt focus on the lack of farm work.    The situation now is infinitely more complicated.  But the goal of keeping obsolete jobs has the same lack of validity.    The head of Obamas OSHA is about the last place you should be looking for any honest assessment regarding workers or the economy.  OSHA never did anything to improve worker safety or health.

11340309,0,t1_dfguyab,Im a little confused about your k number. You have k in cash k in an IB account and k in company stock? The k in company stock could be considered cash but if its doing well Id just leave it there and let the mature so you dont pay short term capital gains on it. What is the money in your IB account doing? Is it invested or just sitting there? It sounds like you would be fine increasing the amount in your IB account to k and parking that in a vanguard fund. Leave k in cash for emergencies less if your situation is fairly stable. If you dont need it for  years then a total market fund might work to give you  which isnt a huge amount but certainly better than letting your money sit idle.,investing,dfhekdz,3,t5_2qhhq

Distribution channel and merchandisers. So yeah they grew natural cigarettes by basically forcin every store to have natural cigs on their sets by holding Newport hostage. Then they used their merchandisers to enforce those policies instore. I would wager most of that growth is just from forced distribution of their product which granted does eventually lead to more sales. But growing a product by double digits doesnt mean anything when a  growth rate moved their market share from  to ..

Fiduciary StandardsThe suitability standard can end up causing conflicts between a brokerdealer and underlying client. The most obvious conflict has to do with fees. Under a fiduciary standard an investment advisor would be strictly prohibited from buying a mutual fund or other investment because it would garner him or her a higher fee or commission. Under the suitability requirement this isnt necessarily the case because as long as the investment is suitable for the client it can be purchased for the client. This can also incentivize brokers to sell their own products ahead of competing products that may be at a lower cost.,investing,dg8xvjj,4,t5_2qhhq

For an investor just entering the fund that week this benefit obviously does not exist. Im not sure whether or not he understands the meaning of the term offset either.

11736635,0,t1_dgpeeg6,A mall near me was dying in the early s now it has costco target and dicks. Which has greatly helped the place. The question for big box stores is they have to specialize and be a destination for something. You need an identity that makes people what to go there. Target has their chic but cheap image. Costco is we have  or  of everything but its really good for the price and have seasonal items. Dicks higher end sporting goods great in store expeience. Personally I think the future of retail is decline of brick and mortar stores not elimination just decline. Amazon might also open up some storesdistributionpickup centers. But its on mall operators to reimagine their spaces towards more mixed use especially those with good locations. Mixed use would mean apparments transportation hubs restaurants and i can only dream live music venues. If you cant get people to drive to you then make them communities in and of themselves. Many will of course fail and go the way of the corner store but as inner cities rents have increased pushing out small unique business moving the art gallery or knittng shope hobby shop jewler ect to the mall might me an option. Another is also converting them to artist and artisan workshops coops diy crafter coops ect. It would be really cool if you could have d printing shops and crafters.,investing,dgqdlej,1,t5_2qhhq

11777225,0,t1_dgty892,I disagree.  Bonds are garbage in the current economy.  They may be a necessary evil for money you will be spending within ten years but not for money you start to spend  to  years from now.  Wait for interest rates to return to normal or until ten years before retirement to start with bonds.    Rebalance every few years.  There is no point to precision in excess of accuracy a concept scientists are supposed to understand but investors should as well.  You are balancing to match a crudely guessed target whether that target is your own creation or that of a supposed expert.    When diversifying remember you should mostly diversify the total of all accounts rather than independently diversify each.  But understand two things that skew that simple idea     Each dollar of Roth has more value and had more cost than a dollar of pretax.  You dont know exactly how much more value but make a sane guess based on some estimate of your tax and financial situation in retirement.  Say you decide  of Roth has the value of  of pre tax.  Then the original K of K total is . Roth because of that value adjustment rather than the  Roth from simple math.  So if you decide you want the Total to be  small cap and decide to do that within the Roth that would be just under half the Roth using adjusted value rather than  of the Roth as you would get from unadjusted.     Once spending the money is MUCH closer think about whether you would spend from both accounts equally or from one first which is a tax decision then allocate the bonds where you think you would spend first.,investing,dguzhzd,0,t5_2qhhq
