7544039,0,t1_d2zfure,gtI remember nothing from Geometry memory is such a bitch. Same with most math honestly.I mean if youre not using what you learned its probably not that useful to remember. Im guessing the exception would be Math but eh.gtEveryones losing their mind with Radiohead right now sooo trying to stay out everything musical until it slows down a little.Lol just dont read anything related to them then.

7863630,0,t1_d3ysjqq,Ive been watching Rashomon in chunks lel just about to finish itI get annoyed at contemporary art museums as everyone here just thinks its rubbish anyone could have done that. They only offer tickets with  dollars less if youre underage here.I watched a playthrough of Shemmue and it just looks excruciatingly slow paced. I know they hadnt perfected sandboxes but cant go back to that pace unless I have lots of free time. Ikaruga is a blast actually dreamcast and Saturn were great for d shootemup. Play some DoDonpachi toonot sure if it was on the Dreamcast. gtPart of possibly the worst experience Ive had with shitty people in that school.Oh well it cant be antidepressants as takes much longer to take effect...and even then theyre very hit and miss. I guess if theyre cool it doesnt matter I had experiences with people who used to have conflict with befriending them later on most people quickly forget about High School happenings too. Could be any reason.  ,NSBTR,d3zxzgn,2,t5_3d3nx

Yeah I do feel like itd let me enjoy Japanonly media more easily without placing my trust in a translation.Guess thats true. Just reading rmexico I could totally understand some dissent on Pope Francis. But whenever I change to a TV channel from nuestros hermanos its not that easy to comprehend them. Modernday Spanish from Spain is not true Spanish the same way we hate Brazilian Portuguese. I can only vaguely comprehend whats in rromania though.I love how you have to make it clear that youre not mexican.,NSBTR,d7m84tl,2,t5_3d3nx
