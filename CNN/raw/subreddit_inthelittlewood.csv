905715,0,t3_1qu4ix,Hey Martyn sorry I didnt notice you had a megathread so Im reposting this here rather than having it on your video link. So first of great videos and I just recently started watching your Yogscast complete pack video and thought to lend you a helping hand one of the really cool mods that is installed called Applied Energetics or AE for short. you started using this mod at the beginning when you made a grindstone but one of the really cool things that this mod allows you to do that I think you may really like is make a massive storage system where you can access everything from one screen and even craft everything in that same screen. later down the line you can have it even auto craft stuff for you too! Here what you will need to start A ME controller which will need to be constantly powered but not much power is needed A Crafting terminal A storage drive with at least  k disk drive it an hold up to  and there are also larger drives. just place the storage drive and crafting terminal next to powered ME controller and you should be good. You can also add more storage drive too later! and later you can even access it all wirelessly but Im not sure what the item is called though sorry hope I helped!,inthelittlewood,ch78hfp,1,t5_2tvqr
