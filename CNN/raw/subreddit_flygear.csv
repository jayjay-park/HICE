The Encounter and Superfine Glass would probably fit that bill. I have several Orvis Clearwater models that I really enjoy and I also have a couple St. Croix rods that like butter but dont make them any more. Another option you might want to consider is overlining the rod using a heavier weight fly line. This might slow the action down a bit and wont cost you nearly as much as a new rod. I know that when I change lines on any of my rods they immediately feel different even if Im sticking with the same weighted line. ,flygear,cwid1pj,2,t5_37bdo
