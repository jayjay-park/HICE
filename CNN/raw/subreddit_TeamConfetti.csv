6449250,0,t3_43uks6,I use Isoflex Whey Protein.  I get mine at popeyes.  My trainer recommended it to me and have been using it since .  Comes in many flavours the strawberry is my favorite!I usually just mix it in with a cup of water after a workout. Or add it to a fruit smoothie. Comes in different sizes too. ,TeamConfetti,czme5g1,2,t5_3bqwr
6607778,0,t1_d02qtms,while im not counting calories i have noticed i get less hungry when i workout consistently. i am probably doing around  calories per day on average. and probably just above  on saturdays. i do waste above  calories daily with the exception of sunday.i should try to use MFPi have an account about  years old or so. i workout on empty stomach but i do have a bowl of corn flakes with fruit yogurt and milk after the workout. which means i normally go from ish pm to am without eating or barely having anything and almost everytme im not that hungry. ,TeamConfetti,d02st8y,1,t5_3bqwr
6690690,0,t3_477ybh,Im not thrilled right now due to what is most likely a hormone related water weight spike. This makes me appreciate tracking big time though because looking back this happened a few weeks ago i.e. pretty much exactly four weeks to the day. Last time I thought it was due to carb ingestion. Now I realize its a cyclical thing and that middle of next week itll all be gone  the weight I was supposed to have lost this week.I was soooo happy to be below  and in spite of exercise and eating consistently at a deficit Ive currently got a  lb water weight spike going on. I know its going to go away and that there is no possible way Ive gained  lbs of fat in  days but the number on the scale still does an impressive job of messing with my head when its bucking the downward trend like this.,TeamConfetti,d0bdjrb,1,t5_3bqwr
6879015,0,t3_49yrky,Weighed in at . this week .lbs down from last week and my lowest weighin of the challenge so far. Yay! Chalking it up to sticking with my fitness routine and having a strenuous day ski trip in the mix because I definitely went over my calories consistently. I think all of the activity made up for it. I am definitely not going to make my challenge goal which I set VERY optimistically at  pounds  Im only down about . But you know progress is progress. And I wouldnt have lost any weight if I hadnt joined this challenge. ,TeamConfetti,d0w1to5,1,t5_3bqwr
