Set up Google Chrome with all the unprivacy settings in google chrome turned off and then install an extension like ublock or umatrix to block tracking to your liking.B. Use a browser based on Node Thrust like Janky browser. Use Node.JS to install.This will have a crappy UI which you can modify using html  css  javascript and probably wont have any real privacy or security features but it will have all the relevant chromium bits built in probably. Also you may want to change openNewTab in browser.js in the AppDataRoamingnpmnodemodulesjankybrowser folder to your search engine of choice. e.g openNewTabYou will need Node.JS to install it and I have no idea how to update it.C. Use Firefox or Opera instead.,Chromium,cmyl9nf,1,t5_2rcyv

I understand what Chromium is but I dont understand what you were saying when you said that devs are rebuilding and sharing stable versions of Chromium on everything except Windows. Those miniinstaller.exe files install a Chromium build so whos building those if not the Chromium team? Are those just autocompiled?,Chromium,cyksh2u,1,t5_2rcyv
