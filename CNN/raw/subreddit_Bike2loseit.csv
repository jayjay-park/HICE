1903644,0,t3_2gb9v5,Man... thats amazing.  How long did it take you to get used the the keto diet?   Ive contemplated it several times but Ive always shied off because I didnt think Id feel happy on just meat and fat... maybe I should look into what vegitarian keto folks are eating and add some of that.  Do you plan to eat carbs again once you reach your target weight?   Im assuming that once a healthy weight is achieved that cal in cal out comes back into play. Have you caught much flack for riding a recumbent?  they dont seem to get a lot of love over on rbicycling but they look like a hoot to me.   I was just given a BikeE with the dangerous seat non fuctional and messed up shifter cables.  Im wondering if its worth cleaning up and adapting in order to have something other than my  Specialized Hardrock FS. Lastly are you from Iowa?  My wife is and I think well be doing at least part of ragbrai or I will and shell be a support vehicle in the next few years. ,Bike2loseit,ckiksxs,3,t5_339y7
