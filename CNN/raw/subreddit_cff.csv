1701380,0,t1_cjtm08g,CFG was just one site in my rotation. Ill be dropping them now. The others were rotowire CFFNews and the cffsite.com. CFFNews above does a really nice job and should definitely be in your rotation.Id also follow twitter. Im not extremely savvy on twitter but I made a list which I embedded along side the chat here Im sure theres a way to see who is on that list. I know Zach above is. Either copy my list or share it or however the hell twitter works and follow that as well. If there are twitter handles missing let me know and Ill add them. The list is just for people who tweet  CFF.,cff,cjtmdrn,1,t5_328e1

4955439,0,t1_cuj0ktf,Other than the wiley deposit bonus they promote here are the main differences I care about.  minimum  deposit on FD compared to the glorious  min at DK lol once a slate starts you cant substitute any of the later games i.e. the whole lineup is locked. Which means get your shit figured out well before lock and youre good.  format and scoring differences. For football its qb rb wr  TE. No flex. You get a half point per reception compared to a full point at DK. At least I think that is what it is on DK because like I said no football for me there yet There are some other small discrepancies like that in other sports and probably a few more in football but you get the jist.,cff,cuj694d,1,t5_328e1
11480383,0,t3_5g5e19,I utilize FanTrax for live scoring but run the rest through Google Docs because FanTrax still doesnt do much in terms of eye candy. ,cff,dfxar40,1,t5_328e1
