8586378,0,t1_d6ed7uk,gt With players acting as Gm...I agree with all of these.  Adding what uMrOsphari said belowsplitting up GM roles based on the jobwould help cement this too.gt Fixed timesAlright a schedule should probably be one of the first things to cover once we move to the new subreddit.gt We do need a new subreddit with more than one moderator. Look at this subreddit.Heh true.  Should I go ahead and create one soon or wait a little while first?  Or should someone else do it?  Im also not sure what to do in terms of adding mods but I suppose we can cover that later.gt We need to keep the history and guides in the forefront of the subreddit for any new players.This is a fantastic pointI suggested stickying the fleet summary thread earlier but keeping the rest of the info in one place would be so much more helpful.gt And with general changes why not just have a mixIts going to be interesting and possibly difficult for our GMs to juggle this many different formats.  It would make the RPG much more interesting though so we should definitely try them out and see how it goes.gt God I feel like I am annoying the piss out of everyone oh well.Absolutely notbad feedback is always better than no feedback and your is far from bad.EDIT  By the way should we give any new players an income boost to let them catch up?  I dont think most people would be far behind starting with m credits but its a possibility.,StardustRPG,d6evvis,3,t5_3f7n3
