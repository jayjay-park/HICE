Yours in particular isnt one where you can easily change the nib but nibs can be switched on other vintage pens.Sometimes you can tell if the nib is original to the pen which might make it more valuable or if it was changed afterwards.  Nibs are often switched so its not always a reliable way to identify or price a vintage pen.

And for the price its at youll have trouble finding a piston filler that is so smooth and easy to clean. If you are looking for a vastly improved Nibtopaper experience and feeling you should save up for a gold nib. If you are looking for a nicer more useful pen Id say go for it.

You dont care to take the time to help the community grow and you refuse to change actions that reddit admins call out as bad read the reddiquette guide linked at the bottom of every page actions the mods here have had to institute some pretty drastic measures to try and combat etc.  So yes the community would be better without those actions and since you have said and I will take you at your word that you dont intend to change but rather escalate those actions I do believe the community would be better without you.  And yes generally you have decent posts but if you are acting behind the scenes to quietly damage the flow in this subreddit those posts can not make up for the subtle sabotage.

865279,0,t3_233vga,So I just got my first ever fountain pen since elementary school a Parker Vector. As its been a while since I last used a fountain pen I have a few really stupid questions Im running out of ink really quickly the pen lasted me roughly  pages I filled about threefifths of the converter. Is this normal? I take classes where I have to take well over  pages of notes.  How do I fill the piston converter completely? Is it safe to eject ink out of the front of the pen by pushing the piston upward? I was just trying to release air when this happened and it made me freak out. Are Diamine inks good? Finally I see a few Indians here and Id like to know if theres a good place to look for ink. Im really interested in trying out different kinds of relatively inexpensive ink.Thanks!,fountainpens,ch2myjn,1,t5_2s0ew

915729,0,t3_24hte9,Do you like wester fine or Japanese fine?  If Japanese grab a Pilot Vanishing Point in Fine.  If Western grab a VP in medium.Honestly the biggest upgrade you can get in addition to or perhaps instead of a more expensive pen is a custom ground andor tuned nib by a nibmeister.  All of my favorite higher tier pens have custom ground nibs and absolutely nothing compares.  As Richard Binder has stated the majority of the time factory nibs arrive not writing at their best whether its an overly drywet feed misaligned tines or a nib that needs smoothing.My very best writer is a Pilot Vanishing Point with Pendleton Browns butter line stub.

I cant list it on fountainpennetwork because their classified section requires that you know what brand it is and warranted K nibs werent a brand they were just a stamp that sort of guaranteed it was K gold. their argument was you cant really put a value on something if you dont know what it is. I like celluloid pens in their looks but its a real tiny pen guessing was designed to be a ladys pen especially with the ring toppendant style.

929599,0,t1_ch9x9g6,I like it fine but you should look for Platinum PTL its not an official UrushiMakie done by Platinum but rather by Wancher Limited a Private label of Engeika on Ebay in Japan basically they took a PTL painted it and put it up for auction I Didnt even know it was a platinum pen until I got it. But far as the base pen itself I like it its bit light weight the nib is pretty soft though a bit scratchy on cheap paper and it has a small degree of flex. SbreBrown did review the PTL here basically same pen as mine minus the artwork. Far as the finish as done by Engeika... it does chip a little over time at the edges and for the love of god keep clear fingernail polish away from it ie in attempt to coat where it does chip it will bubble and eat away at the rest of the urushi lacquer where its applied lol. But other than that mishap near the end cap its been ok. The other thing to avoid with that coating is putting it into a pen case that uses elastic bands to hold the pen eventually they will mark the clear coat with a slight pattern of the elastic.

943780,0,t1_chbjzdr,Yea I can understand your conundrum with the price especially when you have to factor in accessories like the converter especially if you dont have any spare standard internationals thin enough to fit. You already have the next smoothest nib I can think of and for only . By the way they also have a G if you dont mind plastic bodies available with a Fine Medium and BroadStub nib . at JStationery. Comparing the nib between the Metropolitan and the FaberCastell the FC is smooth but the Metropolitan least the one I have with medium is rather close to smoothness to that of the fine nib on my fabercastell. So realistically youre mainly gaining a larger heavier body and a little bit of extra smoothness. Heres a write sample on Mead star notebook paper since youre not likely to have a bunch of expensive paper so you can see least writing wise how similar the MetroM Nib is to the FCFine Nib Essentially as you probably already know most Japanese Medium  Western Fine and Fabercastell is pretty close on the western scale maybe just a hair bigger but not as big as the difference to Lamy. Oh by the way Staples Sells Cartridges of Waterman Intense Black and Serenity Blue but theyre international standard but if you really wanted to you could syringe transfer them but a bottle would be more economical in the long run even if you have to pay shipping though if you had a Platinum Pen they actually make an adapter to put standard international into Platinum Pens. ,fountainpens,chbkbu0,-1,t5_2s0ew

The finish wore off the converter didnt fit properly the clip became loose and unreliable and the black nib caused ink to crust therefore causing flow issues.  If you dont like the awkward grip on the Lamy AlStar chances are the Vanishing Point isnt for you as you have to avoid the clip on the grip section in order to write.

They are carbon steel I believe.They are meant to be cleaned completely after each use which is why they are only really usable as dip nibs.  They are not engineered to be next to a feed.  Since the feed will keep ink against the nib constantly they will corrode over time if you do this. Good luck but probably not a good idea long term. ,fountainpens,ckgc67f,5,t5_2s0ew

You may be entitled to a financial award for damages to your pen.Since this ink has been introduced there have been countless reports of pens getting ruined houses catching fire and the death of small animals.  Black squirrels in particular are susceptible to a rare form of blood poisoning if they come into contact with this ink.   In the state of Massachusetts a state of emergency has been declared due to an employee at a water treatment plant accidentally dropping a Konrad fully loaded with BSB into a major watersupply tank near Boston.  Scores of buildings including a major hospital have been evacuated and it is very likely that the entire water supply system within the city will have be to dug up and scrapped out.

2033940,0,t3_2i0wdo,I have a lot of experience with inks from Noodlers Organics Studio Caran dAche Pelikan Diamine Platinum Waterman Sailor Montblanc Pilot J. Herbin and so on. First I would like to say that I believe of the established ink makers different manufacturers make inks that each have different properties that usually all have pros and cons. I think its all about finding the right ink for the right job. That being said heres a bit more info on some of my personal favorite ink manufacturersSailor. Their inks are generally more viscous yet still flow wonderfully. I have never had any issues with clogging flow or cleaning it out of the pen. A lot of the inks are very bold in color. Even if they are a more muted tone they still command the eye to look upon them. Not to mention the fact that Sailor inks have some amazing sheen as well. Sky High discontinued sadly and Yamadori... so much sheen.As for Noodlers inks I find them much more practical. They are a lot more finnicky and can stain pens dry out more easily and require a bit more maintenance overall. Not a ton of maintenance mind you but enough to possibly make cleaning out a forgotten pen a hassle. Still they are cheap they come in a ridiculous amount of colors and the bulletproof aspect is really really appealing to me. I have a ton of Noodlers inks in my collection and Im happy to have them.Montblanc inks can be rather expensive when compared to Noodlers and they dont have as wide a range of available colors as Sailor especially if you include the ridiculous amount of Sailor exclusive inks but the inks are really wellbehaved and some of the colors have a subtle striking simplicity to them that is really attractive. Theyve kind of hooked me in with their limited editions cant wait to get a review of Daniel Defoe on my blog!Pilot Iroshizuku inks are often thought of as the holy grail of inks by many enthusiasts and I can understand why. Iroshizuku inks dont come in as many colors as say Diamine inks but it comes in pretty much every color that you really need. Pilot has managed to create an ink that is of moderate wetness can be wonderfully vibrant and be absolutely one of the best behaved sets of inks Ive ever used. I think I tend to agree with Stephen Brown on this when I paraphrase him and say that whether you think its worth the money or you think its too expensive... youre right. That being said the new Caran dAche inks are too damn expensive haha.,fountainpens,ckycwv7,1,t5_2s0ew

Personally all the inks Ive owned didnt need to be shaken as there has no significant change between a fresh bottle and one that has been sitting around for some time based on my inkpen journal. Turns out my Noodlers  Brown is my first ink that needs a gentle shake before use. After  bottles of ink I guess Ive been lucky!Edit Bad spelling ,fountainpens,cl03oe2,3,t5_2s0ew

I started with dippens and Blackletter and then moved onto fountain pens and Business writing when I wanted to write nicely at school.Of course I was and am absolutely terrible at Business writing so I sort of developed my own cursive and built upon it from there effectively developing my own personal unique script. For pens I started with the metro and then devoted my limited income to moving my way up the food chain. I now own a Pilot Prera Metro and Vanishing point a Pelikan m and a couple vintage Parkers. The Vanishing point was given to me as a birthday present and it has seen me through many many school notes thus far. Forgive me if I give too much irrelevant information  none of my friends really enjoy fountain pens so I dont get to talk about my hobby very often. The Curriculum in Canada does not mention the teaching of cursive in any way shape or form for elementary grades Kindergarten  . I know this because I wrote a relatively bad essay on it in one of my recent English courses. It is really quite unfortunate as none of my classmates can even read my writing let alone create something similar. Heck even when I was just starting and it looked horrible I would get compliments on how neat I was. Its really quite sad and I cant fathom why its not being taught. Sure with the rise of keyboards there is less need for the teaching of formal hand writing but for gods sake the majority of my peers notes look like they were written by a  year old. One would think we could teach our students a least a modicum of neatness in their writing if only for their own sake. Edits Minor grammar corrections. ,fountainpens,cmmoxeh,2,t5_2s0ew

IQ mind says Im going to fix it myself. No brass sheets going on a  month adventure in a few weeks couldnt stand going away without it etc...I jammed my finger nail between the goddamn tines because fuck it. Believe me I cringe saying that but...it actually worked goddammit. It became a firehose there was no more dreaded tiny sweetspot the whole nib was the sweet spot. The tines were misaligned in the process and I tried to straighten them out as much as possible but it writes wet now.My issue is that I believe the tines are a tad Ved out instead of the typical A look which is totally fixable but Im nervous because I lucked out once and I think thats my one if you catch my drift.

You can flush out a converter with water so when you want to switch inks just take apart your pen run water through the parts until it runs clear and you should be good to go. Alternatively you can use a syringe to refill cartridges with the color ink of your choice. I bet a YouTube search would show you how. Good luck.  ,fountainpens,cn39gt7,1,t5_2s0ew

2702985,0,t3_2r0clv,As has been mentioned before you dont need to spend anywhere near that amount on your first or first couple even pen.  The Pilot Metro is a good choice but I prefer the Sheaffer .  Its about double the price of the Metropolitan around .  If you wanna stay in the  range there are three I can think of the Sheaffer VFM Nemosine Singularity and Platinum Plaisir.  All three are good choices but only the Nemosine comes with the option of a stub nib if you wanted to do that and also its the only model with a demonstrator option.  Bc of the Plaisirs inner cap design ink will last longest in it when not in use I mean it doesnt magically make it last any longer when writing.There are some pens that are a step up that I think you should look at as well.  In the  range you will have the TWSBI AL Classic Mini and Vac.  All of those choices are good it would really be a preference thing.  I think the Vac is a great pen myself and would call it my favorite of the TWSBIs Ive used.  The other pen in the same  range that I simply cant recommend enough is the Parsons Essential only from MrPen.co.uk.  It has flat out the smoothest nibs Ive used even compared to MUCH higher priced pens.  It looks like a lot more expensive pen as well and has a good solid feel to it.  Its just a really beautiful classic styled pen.  The catch is its only from MrPen as it is their house brand Italix.  So in addition to shipping if you are in the US you have to contend with currency conversion.  Right now though even after currency conversion and shipping its still only . or so for the basic black for any of the colored or marbled versions throw another  on there.  But with the Parsons Essential you can choose from stubs italic oblique italic oblique for both left or right hands and regular nibs in fine med and broad.  The stubsitalicsitalic oblique nibs also offer and extra broad.  There is even a gold medium nib if you wanted to go that way which I wouldnt as someone new to FPs.  Something like  nib options!Just keep in mind as the other replies mentioned the less you spend on a pen the more you have to spend on a bottle of ink and some nice paperjournals so definitely keep that in the back of your mind while deciding as well.,fountainpens,cnbbi3b,3,t5_2s0ew

The reason I suggested the metro is that it is cheaper has a better nib is more durable and the japanese nib sizes would be better for cheaper paper because they produce a finer line. The only reason the safari would win in my book is more body color options as well as being slightly more serviceablewhich is not really all that great of a feature for cheaper pens. The Safari also does post better than the metro. The metro is also much cheaper than the safari which makes it a great pen for school stuff in case you losebreak it,fountainpens,cngp1fq,0,t5_2s0ew

2857421,0,t1_cnsj6cl,I used MB Midnight Blue back when I was working in organic chem and microbio labs for school.  The fact that the ink was ferrogallic not only gave me a level of comfort in its durability to withstand accidental reagent or detergent spills but I absolutely LOVED the chemistry of it.  It is what actually drew me to trying an iron gall in the first place.  Know all the old documents you see and the ink looks kind of rusted?Its because it was written with an iron gall ink!  Over time the bits of iron actually oxidize and it will go from that bluish black color to that rusted color that is so prevalent in older documents.   Iron gall inks are purported to be a bit more corrosive on pens than other inks.  I was using it in a Waterman Carene with a gold nib hoping that the gold would be less reactive than a stainless steel nib.  Still I made sure to flush it more regularly than other pens.  After using it for  years Ive found no ill effects on the pen.Ive since switched to a non iron gall specifically Noodlers th Massachusetts after I heard that Montblanc changed their formula away from iron gall.  The Noodlers th works quite well and I actually like the color more than the Montblancs.  Heres an image Ive been using to demonstrate the color I get from it.  If youre working in a lab I highly recommend going with a permanent ink.  Blueblacks are also an awesome way to use an ink that looks subtly different if you are aware that the color isnt the standard blue or black but professional enough that I feel confident using it in a medical setting.What are you studying?,fountainpens,cnsw0pa,2,t5_2s0ew

I think the Noodlers pens are simply convenient for showing on a cheap pen whats possible in terms of selfservice. ,fountainpens,co9s6jb,1,t5_2s0ew

Nevertheless what he almost always says is how they are smoother than he expected not that they are some of the smoothest around.  In fact when reviewing the Jinhao  he says Ive had scratchier nibs Ive also had smoother nibs  He says something similar about the Jinhao x The nib was smooth out of the box.  Umm it did have something that Ive felt with other pens from China its not so much that its scratchy but it gives a bit of feedback.  I smoothed it out a little bit I think its ok.  He says these things as a compliment the pen is smooth and decent for the price not that they are equivalent to a high end pen.gtI also own many of them and they are all super smooth.Great but what are you comparing them to?,fountainpens,coog5bz,3,t5_2s0ew

3158329,0,t3_2wbq9o,One thing you can do is hold the pen upsidedown and look along the barrel toward the tines while holding it up to the light. If you can visibly see the tines of the nib not lining up together to make a straight line then that could be where your scratchiness is coming from. Theres a couple of really good videos you can find on YouTube Matt Armstrong of The Pen Habit just posted a really good one a few weeks ago thatll give you more details on nib adjustment and usually youll want some kind of magnifier usually a jewelers loupe for getting things really precise. But the unaided eye can usually pick out if there are really severe alignment issues going on just by getting enough light and looking at it from the right angle. Hope youre able to figure it out!,fountainpens,copcx5h,3,t5_2s0ew

Ive never used one but Im assuming Im looking for a similar experience to the namiki falcon just in a mod that I can do to the many cheap nibs I have laying around rather than buy a pen thats worth about as much as Ive spent thus far on pens.

3318867,0,t1_cp6jm2m,Noodlers black contains a chemical that causes the ink to bind to the cellulose on paper. It isnt particularly thick but it is particulate and I have just read that if you let the pen sit for a very long time you would need to probably let the pen soak for a while to clean it. I wish I owned a Noodlers ink bottle so I could tell you what it is like but I have yet to buy a bottle in these low temperatures for fear of broken bottles. I have read very few accounts of the ink clogging pens and it doesnt stain the interior of the pen because the chemical is very specific to paper. One ink that I know comes in smaller bottles oz and is cheap is Parker Quink which is known to flow well and dry fast. I have heard nothing but good things about it.

The only way to avoid this was to write with a ridiculously and uncomfortably small angle between the pen and the paper.

If you dont already have a pen with a broad or stub nib buy a Pilot Plumix around  and pull out the nib and stick it in your Metro. They are completely interchangeable and youll have a stub nib of about .mm width very easy to use and it will put a lot more ink in a wider line on the paper and youll be able to appreciate the glitter of SG.If all I had was fine nibs Id never put Stormy Grey in the pens.

3462140,0,t3_2zutv6,Some thoughts on flex pens because Ive had some experience with them Modern flex really does not compare to true vintage flex. I have tried a lot of modern flex nibs such as  Noodlers flex Pilot soft nibs the Pilot Justus adjustable nib Platinum Cool Platinum Elastic nibs just to name a few. IMO the only modern stock nibs that can really compare to vintage flex are  OMAS extra flessibile nibs these go on gt OMAS Celluloid pens and Pilot FA nib which comes on Pilot pens within your price range but from what Ive seen in reviews and based on my limited time trying one out the feed does not really keep up with the flex so it tends to railroad a lot.The other nibs can give some decent line variation but I feel you will be disappointed if youre expecting real flexibility.As for a suggestions I know you said no vintage but for  you could get a mint in boxnew old stockfully restored vintage Aurora  which is a very nice pistonfiller that isnt finnicky like the older leverfillerbuttonfillervacumaticetc vintage pens.Other than that maybe you could share what pens you already have so I can recommend something different for you.,fountainpens,cpmwqe2,2,t5_2s0ew

3473396,0,t3_3019ou,You can refer to this site for a chart on which pens come with which nibs. Nibs are unable to be swapped to other models unless you buy from a brick and mortar store or a seller who is willing to do the swap for you. AFAIK only one online store sells a Pilot model with a swapped nib  Tokyo Pen Shop Quill sells the Custom  with the option of selecting a WA Wavily or FA Falcon nib. Refer here for a chart on what the different nibs are.The regular nibs FFMMB have a slight springiness but are not soft per se. The soft nibs SEF SFM SM have noticeably more give and bounce and the tines spread more giving you a cushioned feel while writing. As for the discrepancies in certain sites offering certain nibs only  are these nibs offered on the same model and colour across all sites? For instance some models only have the extended range of nibs for only one colour of that model  e.g. the Custom  in black has all nib sizes available but the deep red does not from engeika.com. Is everything the same except the range of nibs offered? If that is the case my assumption is the sellers not offering them did not order those nib widths thinking they were not popular.Edit The above is for the CustomCustom Heritage models. VPs do not come with soft nibs though their writing feel is not exactly a nail. It is not flexy and the tines do not spread but the nib feels springy and cushioned. There is very little line variation to be had out of those nibs. They are available in gold either yellow rhodium or black coloured nibs or steel special alloy nibs.Hope this helps.,fountainpens,cpo6xzt,3,t5_2s0ew

These two I got turned out to be really reliable comfortable writers that given I paid about  for both Im not afraid of damaging well they were reliable once I heatset the nibfeeds  not straight out the box. I was lucky though because I actually ordered two Ts and the second one had a looseish clip and was prone to leaking from the section before I consigned it to my notinrotation pen case. And although the nibs on all my AirmailWalitys were smooth even the FPR dude said that some Airmail nibs can be scratchy.

They were  for a pack of two containing  ink cartridges of a lovely shade of blue ink  almost worth it for the ink alone! The pens themselves are pretty basic but functional and they write OK but certainly nothing special. I bought them because I have an interest in the super cheap end of the fountain pen market.I noticed that the nib fitting looked very similar to that used for Lamy nibs and in fact I have an unused Lamy broad nib lying around that got sent to me accidentally on a pen instead of the left hand nib Id actually ordered. I thought I might as well give it a try and it fit perfectly. It writes beautifully as well no difference in smoothness compared to if it were fitted to an actual Lamy pen. Given that you can get Lamy nibs online for about  this could be a way for any UK readers to try out some Lamy nibs cheaply if you dont have a Lamy pen and also with the advantage of accepting standard international cartridges rather than Lamy proprietary ones.,fountainpens,cpus139,11,t5_2s0ew

Of course this might not entirely be the approach you want to take.Sailor KOP Naginata TogiI recommend looking up reviews from the Fountain Pen Network on these nibs. There are also some blog and videos reviews out there. Some people love them and some people are extremely disappointed as the nibs are not what they expected. Depending on how you write you may find that you cant comfortably get line variation out of this nib. It may be best to be able to try out the nib before buying.Basically a cc pen w possibly an ebonite body or just a plastic one. What justifies the  price vs ?Some people take the route of having a nib custom ground into a naginata togi by a nibmeister. Is there one aspect of the pen you value most or is it the whole package you want?MB IMO the okest pen ever. Considering specs only gold nib plastic body double threaded piston filler you can get a comparable pen for  or even less. Is the brand name worth an additional  to you? As with the KOP if the whole package doesnt elevate the pen over the sum of its parts for you its not going to be worth it.Modern European nibs are somewhat haphazardly made with excessive tipping material blobbed on and being smoothed out to hell. Did you know that its only in recent years that buttery smooth nibs are the ideal? I remember the fp sales pitch used to be about feedback.Pelikan SouveranSimilarly overpriced if you go the boutique route there are much cheaper channels available similarly blobbystiff nib as the MB. It may be because I write with little to no pressure but Pelikan nibs are pretty rigid to me.NakayaYou really have to value the craftsmanship here. Its a conservatively designed cc pen.

A pen flush of some sort seems to be in order such as JB Pen Flush KohINoor or even Goulet pen flush.

I usually use that flush after a  day soak in water with a few good flushes of said water with a converter or bulb. Then I use the pen flush to get the stubborn bits.

They ship the noodlers feed unmodified and suited for everyday usage to get the increased flow needed for artistic use you have to enlarge the feed channel.

3804161,0,t1_cqp7xo6,First let me say I have owned a couple of Lamy ks which where just wonderfully smooth.  But as I have read and experienced myself the pens due tend to have a smaller sweet spot but once you get use to it the pen writes like butter.  The latest Lamy K I purchase was a medium nib and the pen has been nothing but trouble with flow and I have not had time to play with it or send it back.  The other thing about the Lamy k which is a personal thing is it does seem to feel and fit perfectly in my hand.  I own  TWSBI s Medium and Fine and they both write well with just a slight feed back on the fine nib. I generally keep these pens inked with Diamine Red Dragon and Private Reserve Sherwood Green.  Although the TWSBI s are a little larger and at the point at which I grip the pen is wider I find these pens comfortable in my hand.  The TWSBIs actually replaced my Lamy Safaris primarily because I wasnt a fan of the Safaris contouring grip and the TWSBIs just looked better.  In reality I think the pen are on par and the price differential is do to the difference in filling systems.  My Pilot VP is a fine which is inked up with Noodler Black.  I find the fine to be a little scratchy but is what I use to write in my small note books which has cheaper paper quality but allows me to write with very little bleed through or feathering.  I think I would get a smother writing experience from the Pilot VP with a medium or possible a broad since the Japanese pens tend to run more to the finer side.  The other thing I would mention is that the Pilot VP doest really hold a great deal of ink in the converter where as the Lamy k and TWSBI  are piston fill and hold a great deal of ink.  Second I would try to find some way of actually holding the pen before you buy because I know some people have a problem griping the pen down by the clip.  Believe it or not all  pens are my everyday carry pens.  If your choice comes down between the VP or the k my personal opinion would be to go for the Lamy K and if cost is a consideration you wont be disappointed by the TWISB .  Hope this was helpful and if you have any other question PM me.,fountainpens,cqpwl7t,1,t5_2s0ew
3809206,0,t3_341ewo,I have both of these pens. The Prera writes like a  pen because it functionally IS a  pen using the same nib as is on the  G and the  plumix plus the  Metropolitan. The plastic is thin the pen is small and it is not a piston filler.I have a TWSBI . The plastic is thicker it seems more durable it works better and it writes like a  pen plus is a size for normal humans. To me there is no contest and Im definitely not a TWSBI fan. I recommend Sheaffer Parker any number of other brands before a TWSBI but the Prera is one of the worst values in pens and the TWSBI is pretty good.Remember Reddit is fickle and in  days youll be hearing more about how TWSBI is the second coming of Christ.

Sure one might get better mileage than the other but its a meaningless comparison because you use a truck and a sports car for completely different things. You only care about the gas mileage of the truck compared to other trucks. A more fair comparison would be to look at the cost of a fountain pen compared to if the manufacturer makes one the rollerball or ballpoint version of that same pen  and the price of ink compared to the price of rollerballballpoint refills. ,fountainpens,cr0xuig,4,t5_2s0ew

3998596,0,t1_crbsmym,I have had a couple. They are perfectly functional pens no question. They have for most of the time an adequate steel nib that has the advantage of being swapped out easily and inexpensively. There is everything about the pen to recommend it as a hardworking daily use pen.But even if one falls in love with the elementary utilitarian design the one thing you cant overlook is that every version is identical with the exception of the color and on some rare occasions the clip color. That is all. For people to amass collections of these is just total fetishism which is perfectly fine but it is what it is. And the Beanie Babies comparison is quite apt because since there are no functional or even stylistic differences between them heck the Babies had more variety! the only reason people collect them is because of the panorama of colors. Which again is fine. That makes it a good thing that they are relatively cheap pens.Paying that price is an indication that this is a hobby item a collectible item just like anything else that manipulates people into paying a lot of money for multiple similar objects. It just is what it is  asking price for a certain colored piece of plastic. Any my purpose in typing all this was to answer the OPs question Why?,fountainpens,crc2lj4,1,t5_2s0ew

4544433,0,t1_ct3foln,Hi  when you say too slow do you mean that it railroads when you flex it?  Or that it just writes dry overall?If its railroading that is a problem of the feed not being able to keep up with the flex and that unfortunately is a common issue with Pilot feeds and their flexible nibs and cant really be remedied.However if it is writing too dry overall I have found the following order of adjustments to work best for me starting from conservative to more aggressive.  You need  items  brass sheets can be ordered from Goulet or Andersonpens.  I actually prefer the Anderson pens ones as theyre a little thicker and a loupe.   Take a brass shim and floss the tines taking the corner of the shim inserting it into the breather hole and moving down to the tip.  This generally doesnt do much but clean out the channel.   Insert the shim in between the tines and just leave it there for  minutes or longer.  If that doesnt help double or triple up on the shims inserting them and leaving them in between the tines for increasing periods of time testing as you go.    Generally it comes down to this step especially with K nibs because K nibs are springy and by their very nature can spread without having a permanent effect.  The above step of just leaving the shims in there generally only work for steel nibs or higher karat pens like Sailors K.   Take a brass shim and insert it in between the tines  ideally you want the nib out of the pen and thankfully with the  you can remove the nib and feed friction fit.  Move the nib down so that it is about halfway dow the shim then fold over the shim in your fingers grabbing each end with one hand and holding the back of the nib firmly in your other hand. Gently at first tug in each direction left and right to spread the tines apart.  Use your loupe to look at the gap as you go.  You dont want to overdo it because decreasing flow is a lot harder than increasing but can be done.  Again the K nib on the  can be stubborn because its made to be somewhat flexible.  I found the greatest success by pulling one way holding counting to  then pulling the other way counting to  and repeating.  Because this method is more aggressive and getting the perfect horizontal angle on your tugs is difficult there is a high probability you will misalign the tines.  Once the flow is where you want it simply adjust the tines back into alignment with your loupe.  It might sound terrifying and it was for me the first time I did it but honestly once you get the hang of it its pretty easy to adjust your own nibs.,fountainpens,ct3galu,2,t5_2s0ew

However it still trumps them both. The nib is not hard having a small amount of flex to it just enough to cushion any pressure changes while you write. The M nib is not to thick my writing can be quite small but is still readable with the M nib which is not always the case.The shapeampsize of the pen along with its weight make it sit in the hand wonderfully whilst the pen is larger and heavier than my others this works well for me as I find pens like my vacumatic or a duofold to feel far to cramped in terms of hand space after a extended period of writing.

4809102,0,t3_3gqut6,I think it is imported from other hobbies that have much higher caps on price. For instance if youre a fashion enthusiast its no trouble to find k pieces like designer leather jackets. If youre a watch enthusiast its no trouble to find k watches around. In those fields that price range has a fair number of items occupying it. Meanwhile there are some super expensive pens but in terms of actual production items that you can actually find to buy everything is relatively affordable. Like Montblanc is essentially the Rolex of pens and their flagship model is what ? Meanwhile a Rolex Sub is like .So my point is that I think there is a lot of crossover in slang between hobbyist communities and grail is one of those words that is used in many communities to describe something that is either hard to find or way out if your price range. Its just not quite applicable to pens the same way unless youre looking for a super limited edition pen or vintage pens I think.

4812683,0,t1_cu15yzw,Something to keep in mind is that no modification of a nib can actually make the metal be able to flex more. Thatd be replacing the nib. This is all a flex mod can do Distribute the flexibility along the tine so that you can push a little harder and not have it kink in one particular place but instead keep flexing until it breaks everywhere. Manufacturers that make soft nibs are generally not that bad at this as it tends to save them some costs if they can do this instead of changing their alloy but third party modifications are often designed to do it a bit better. Lengthen the slit. Not many flex mods do this but itll make longer tines so that you can have more flexibility. However it comes at a large cost such as having flow issues this is why a lot of people have trouble with the flow on their Noodlers flex pens  the slit goes all the way up. Make flexing the tines push them more out than up. This is pure sorcery. Maybe its done partially by slightly adjusting curvature? I dont know but it can be done to a very limited extent. Making flexing the nib easier. This is what a large part of a good flex modification will do. That means that the potential line variation wont change very much but itll be easier to flex so it makes the nib much more dangerous to use if you dont have experience with that sort of thing. So be careful.That being said Ive heard Mottishaw Falcons are an absolute joy to use so dont let me keep you from getting that mod done. Just please please dont spring your nib right after getting it back.,fountainpens,cu16g2h,2,t5_2s0ew

Im guessing this isnt whats happening though unless its also a little wetter than it used to be and the change is permanent. I also dont think its heat with paper friction because I cant think of a single way thatd be relevant. Could be... Youre getting used to how the nib behaves at different angles my writing changes depending on the pen I use even unflexed just because they all have their little quirks of what they like and dont like Heat from your hand could be encouraging the ink to flow a little more especially if you have a partial fill of ink but modern pens are designed to not behave like this thats why theres an air gap between the body and the filling system though. Sometimes your eternal soul gets trapped inside the feed and slowly releases with the ink as the pen blackmails you with eternal dissatisfaction with life without it.

5093783,0,t1_cuzxy0u,Id be careful choosing your paper.  Or at the very least buy with the intention of disappointment thats what I do.  It can be really tough to find nice fountain pen friendly paper especially with wet nibs.Imagine my surprise when my second Rhodia Webnotebook bleed and feathered like a piece of tissue paper.  The ghosting on leuchtturm is very consistent. Mnemosyne is nice but patchy.  where some parts perform wonderfully and other parts just feathers and bleeds.   Apita Premium notebooks are similar but are much more consistent than Mnemosyne.  Clairfontaine is nice but Ive only tried one notebook.  And Ive got a moleskine sketchbook that says it is fountainpen friendly.  Ill eventually find out.   The point Im getting at is paper is different everywhere even within a manufacturer.  Im going to put on my rage cap on so please take what I say with an appropriate pinch of salt.   I looked at the etsy links you posted and noticed that they are based in Hong Kong.   There are a few things I find suspect.    Midori doesnt actually make an A leather notebook.  It is an A notebook folded in half.   The images shows what appears to be an A notebook or its really distorted and images for midori sized refill.  they seem incompatible widths and a waste of space.    I also suspect for no reason other than my own cynicism that their refills are not actually midori MD paper.  At best some facsimile they sourced off taobao. But I might be curious to see how well that paper performs.  ,fountainpens,cuzzpne,1,t5_2s0ew

5128913,0,t3_3l85tt,Depending upon the paper you are writing this could be due to the ink spreading. Some inks I use on cheap paper result in a wide line while other inks looks ok  thinner.

5131806,0,t1_cv4ka3u,So perhaps we have a different understanding of what the purpose of the fountain pen. For me its just a tool. Its a means to an end rather than an end itself. Or in other words I dont view it as a luxury item. Also I dont think we view what is beautiful writing the same way. Small precise lines where you can see the quiver or lack thereof in the hand is what I find interesting to look at  that I feel is sacrificed in the larger nibs. Fine nibs fully displays the steadiness of the hand or the emotion of the moment. That to me is beautiful handwriting  a demonstration of expertise and control. I rarely go on FPN so I cant speak to that. My point was that in my experience in this subreddit why I thought people be drawn to them. While I like using fountain pens Im also understanding that frankly I dont even need pens. My work is done on the computer all paper copies will be digitalized in the end or be destroyed or lost.  I like writing by hand which is why I choosing to use a fountain pen. That is in my daily life at least. I actually do calligraphy and practice handwriting at home so I do have quite of few pens that dont go out with me for this purpose. ,fountainpens,cv4kon3,10,t5_2s0ew

5175236,0,t1_cv9knf9,I have a Sailor pen with a similar issue. I all but fixed the problem by doing the followingHold it right. This may not be your issue but it was part of the issue with me. Like the famous Lamy  Sailor nibs have w small sweet spot. The difference is that the Lamy is scratchy outside the sweet spot while the Sailor simply doesnt write. If you cant fix the issue by holding it a different wayTry a different ink. Some inks simply dont agree with some pens. If that doesnt workClean it and clean it well! Make sure you use pen flush or diluted ammonia or bleach but not both! rather than just water to make sure you get any gunk in the feed out. Then soak it in pure water overnight or at least for a couple of hours. If that doesnt workFloss the tines. You can buy thin brass sheets to do so but I am a bit skeptical of putting an expensive nib to brass so I prefer to rip off the corner of a sheet of paper and use that. Press the nib to paper as if youre writing and use gentle pressure to slightly spread the tines. Then quickly so the paper doesnt become too wet and fall apart run the corner of the paper through the open slit from towards the section to the end of the nib. This was what really solved it for me. If it doesnt work for you its probably time to get someone to work on it. It could be a babys bottom issue that sounds likeliest to me or a misaligned feed or something but its hard to tell without seeing it in person.,fountainpens,cv9t12s,2,t5_2s0ew

5435543,0,t3_3phldx,I buy individually based on the ink colors and properties that interest me.  With the colorbased packages I dont really want  samples of the same color all at once.  However the employee favorites or most popular packages can be a good introduction to several popular inks at once e.g. Sherwood Oxblood KonPeki th Massachusetts Heart of Darkness etc. if those colors appeal to you.  Youll be hearing a lot about those colors anyway if you frequent message boards often.Buying ink samples is pricey for what you get so eventually you want to narrow down what you want to start with so that you can buy a full bottle.  So my goal in samples is to try the ones I think I would be most interested in make sure they work well with my paper and pen make sure I like their color in person so that I wont get bored of them and then order a bottle.As ucperson said youll also need the Z converter if you dont already have it.

Strange as it sounds they replace a lot of vintage components with modern equivalents feeds for sure among other things which destroys the value of a vintage pen.  There are several suppliers out there who can get you parts for your pen and you can take it to an independent pen repair shop to have your pen fixed bringing it back to original condition.  Now regarding the service you received it wouldnt hurt to contact the CEO.  They are after all responsible to the board for the conduct of their company and should be able to help you address your concerns in some way shape or form.  Can you elaborate as to your experience?

5640835,0,t3_3sdann,I like to gently spread the tines and then let them return back. Then try writing again it should write at tad bit more wet. Repeat until you get the perfect flow. Go slowly the first time because you dont want to overshoot your target. Its really that easy. I do this all the time with my fountain pens. It works with gold and stainless steel nibs. Just be patient and go slow. You can even do the reverse to make it write less wet. Ive been collecting fountain pens for the last three years and came across this problem many times. You can do it yourself and save yourself the time and money of sending it out to a nibmeister. Getting a new grind is a whole different story. You can also align the tines easily but I would recommend using a loop.

Some styles need a finer nib than even the EF can provide and for that the cheapest option would be a Pilot MRMetropolitan in F yes this is finer than a Western EF or a Pilot Penmanship in EF if you want to go really fine. For some styles youll like the TWSBI nibs though. Check Goulets nib nook to be a little more sure what youre getting into I believe they use mm dot paper. As for ink it depends what you like. Do you want something that looks professional for writing? Do you want a certain aesthetic for drawing? Do you care about water resistance keeping in mind that high water resistance  doesnt wash off clothes? Do you have a favourite colour?

5744331,0,t3_3ttvnc,There are quite a few Waterman nibs in this price range and era that exhibit pitting somewhat common on the wellknown and liked Phileas. The nib wont pit when it is in common use and the nib kept clean it more often comes with pens that have been left for long periods months or years with ink sitting on them. If you are now the owner of the pen just good care of the pen should keep it from spreading and its cosmetic  the pen will still write well.Also with this nib in this condition Id probably lean to mild and somewhat safe inks. Any Waterman ink would be a good candidate and Id stay away from anything with higher ph levels especially including any iron gall inks.,fountainpens,cx9528y,6,t5_2s0ew

Bought it and sent it off to Danny Fudge who fixed it up for shipping. That was my favorite pen up until it faded into the mists when I lost it somewhere in Virginia. If you find one that has a good looking nib on it for a decent price the repair can be quite inexpensive. That being said picking up a nice vintage pen that doesnt need any tinkering and works straight away is a beautiful thing.As a side note I wouldnt worry about your pen breaking if its worked on by a professional. Even if it does they usually carry insurance for exactly that kind of event and will often reimburse you the cost of the pen. Good luck! Vacs are awesome little pens.,fountainpens,cxke5re,1,t5_2s0ew

The P in particular comes in a few colors if that matters. They have a sort of timeless ugliness to them however.For filling in bubbles a clutch pencil or lead holder might be a better choice. Lots of options though drafting pencils will be the easiest to come by. Ive used a Rotring  a little bit and I like it but its also pretty spendy especially for a high school student.

5940409,0,t3_3wot46,well youre best off finding the clips and replacing them.  Finding a replacement flighter cap is not going to be easy or cheap.  Look for the appropriate vintage you dont say if it was a vac or aero for the second one and look for a completely trashed pen.  Should be  for a complete unrestored pen.  Youll need to carefully remove the jewel called the clip screw by parker to access the clip screw bushing which can be removed with a flat head screwdriver.  Parker actually had a pair of special tools for the purpose one to keep the inner cap stable and in place and the other to unscrew the bushing.  Then the clip comes off and reverse the procedure to install the clip.  Note the jewel has a very thin stem that is easily broken.  You may need heat to remove the jewel but too much heat will discolor it.  Its not an easy procedure to remove the jewel but once it is out its not too bad.  Just note that the clip screw bushing may have left over adhesive inside which may make screwing the jewel back in very difficult and you can snap the jewel off putting it back on.  If it looks like there is adhesive in the clip screw bushing heat it out with a torch or heat gun to make reinstallation of the jewel easier.  Clean jewels are harder to find than clips.  Clips are easy.,fountainpens,cxybg9k,2,t5_2s0ew

With a  Muji Fountain pen shipped from Japan or even a  Jinhao  when that writes well its like having found a real treasure.

I find Noodlers to be dryer overall unless you go with the generous eel inks and then they take forever to dry. Good value for the price though.I feel the same way about Diamine  amazing selection of colors for an inexpensive price but theyre so dry that it feels like Im pulling the ink through my feed and nib.

Anecdotal evidence shouldnt be taken as fact.However some people have had luck with simply storing fountain pens fully filled nib up in a ziplock bag.

6658978,0,t1_d0839fa,My thought was that he wanted something more conversational than practical. He said he wanted something to catch his eye and every pen in his picture looks like it already works fine with cheap paper. You could pick up a nice older Montblanc on Ebay around Most Montblanc EFs work fine for cheaper paper unless using one with a really gushing wet ink. And I dont see how the relation between nib width and paper quality has anything to do with negating the advantage of a piston filler which is usually only ink capacity since its not any easier to clean and doesnt typically effect writing performance. Not trying to argue I just dont see the point youre getting at here.The point I was trying to make is that it seems the OP has already filled his needs for a pen and if he wants a nice conversation piece an old Montblanc might be perfect. Just my two cents.,fountainpens,d083gbm,0,t5_2s0ew
6659061,0,t1_d083gbm,My point was poorly worded. Forgive me. Maybe I just like drier pens to begin with but if he wants a conversation piece wouldnt the best way to have it noticed is to use it? An object constantly in motion is more easily noticed than one just sitting on the desk. Yes the pens he does have right now are all practical but you can be practical and flashy. From my experience even after adjusting and using an XF Pelikan nibs seem to write too wet for daily use. If something flashy is wanted and I am already kicking myself for saying this I would look for the gaudiest gold covered Chinese pen I could find. I dont think you can get much more of a conversation piece than some of the chinese pens. Im looking at you JinHao Golden Dragon pen Yes I do know that he is looking for something in the  price range but for me the only thing that comes to mind would be a Pilot Vanishing Point ordered from engika. ,fountainpens,d083rg2,4,t5_2s0ew

Theyre easy to refill if need be but also hold a ton of ink.  As a test Id even refilled mine and left it in the closet for the past YEAR to see how well it fared from being kept in storage without any usage. I wrote with it a couple of days ago and it started up no problem.  There was no hard start whatsoever.  You can take off the logo easily enough with some acetone and get a nice clear barrel.  Im not a fan of the printed design so I always make mine plain using this method.

Most inks will dry fast on poor quality paper since thats what makes the papers low quality.But I find some of the permanent Noodlers inks to have very slow dry times on any good paper.  The exceptions are the inks that bleed a little more like Heart of Darkness Baystate Blue etc.Depending on how wet your pen is  seconds isnt necessarily an unusual dry time for those inks.  Even  minutes is possible.,fountainpens,d0iyj8b,1,t5_2s0ew

6771619,0,t3_48hx81,I have the same problem with my light colored Edison Collier so I emailed Brian Goulet and Brian Gray about it.  They both gave me the same advice which did help with some stains but I still have a bunch that arent coming out.  Edison said that they could do some work on it to remove the staining and some other problems I have but ultimately suggested not carrying the pen to and from work because jostling will cause ink leakage.  I use a . stub in mine and it definitely leaks more than the F nib Ive also tried in it.Use a cleaner that has a little bleach in it.  Something like this.NOT straight bleach.  A cleaner that has a little bleach.  And this is a liquid cleaner not a paste cleaner.Now I will say this  I would not recommend using this method in other pens or especially vintage pens.  Some pen manufacturers will not honor a warrantee if youve used bleach on their pen.  We will but I also know how to instruct you how to do this right.  So be careful what pens you do this to.Youll need a test tube brush.  I recommend the tool linked below but any stiffer test tube brush will be fine.  scroll way down until you see Item PT for If the stains are on the exterior then an old toothbrush will work.And heres how youll do thisSpray the cleaner directly onto the test tube brushtoothbrush.  Then you will brush the interior or exterior of the pen while you are holding the pen under running water.  This way the bleach will have its effect but it will be instantly washed away.Do this a few times.  Afterwards be sure to very thoroughly flush the pen with clean water to get rid of all residual bleach.You success will depend on what ink it was.  There are some inks that are pretty darn stubborn and wont be removed.  But most waterbased and safe inks can be cleaned out.If you find that this doesnt work then youll simply need to use safer inks in pens that are lighter in color.  Keep inks that tend to stain in dark colored pens that will hide the stains.,fountainpens,d0juezo,1,t5_2s0ew

Id rather have you use either a pencil or erasable pen.  Whenever Ive been getting your papers back it seems a bit more difficult to read due to the inability to erase fountain pen ink.  All the scratch outs are distracting to me while reading your work as well as making it difficult for the paper to be neat enough for me to read.Im willing to compromise with an erasable pen as long as you show me that you can write neatly and any mistakeserrors that are made are NOT scratched out.

Its interesting on the herculaneum scrolls because it may be the only way to read them.  Source  Lots of time in the umich papyrology lab many years ago,fountainpens,d1inoqn,2,t5_2s0ew
7081901,0,t3_4cl1ah,You can get vintage semiflex gold nibs from Pelikan that fit the M custom made section and easily get firmer modern steelgold nibs for daily writing. Note that the former isnt really a flex nib but you really dont have that many options for true flex nibs at a reasonable price.Esterbrook nibs are good as well from extra fine to stubs manifold to flexible. They are also quite cheap and abundant in the vintage market. Pilot and Faber Castell either dont sell their nibs separately or are very hard to obtain so Id rule them out. The standard  etc. nibs are fine for normal use but Id find them quite boring especially if you are given the chance to use a custom made section!,fountainpens,d1j3ki2,2,t5_2s0ew
7083146,0,t3_4ckzov,I recently inked all my pens  and then deinked the ones I did not like Serwex  Two Pilot Penmanships Pilot Plumix Parker  Esterbrook . The Serwex  worked well as an eyedropper pen and even wrote smoothly but man it felt incredibly cheap. The Penmanships have cool EF nibs and work well as eyedropper pens but... in the end they just feel too cheap. The Parker  is kind of a neat pen but maybe something didnt seal well because the nib would dry when not in use. It wasnt fun to start it again. The Esterbrook  is weird. Its the smoothest nib I own  so smooth its actually uncomfortable to use  it gives me a fingernailsonchalkboard cringe.

On the other hand real MB knockoffs are sometimes so well made at least aestheticswise that apparently even pen experts have difficulties telling them apart from real MB pens and I would certainly not be surprised if JinhaoHero made these as well unofficially.

7521136,0,t1_d2wzyme,Ok Ill take a crack at some on the questions I can answer.  . Convertors will probably break from the user rather than from attaching. They are made to be sturdier and easily filled and cleared.  . Lamy is a really large company so with any process where something can go wrong and somebody will eventually get a bad nib. The nib shouldnt be overly bad you might just need another.  . No idea.  . There are probably more than a few threads on fountainpennetwork discussing what brands user bock nibs. They are a pretty good company and I would guess write more European than pilot.  . I will be trying out a Lamy black lamy CP and blue lamy Studio this weekend so I will tell you how it goes. You could sand off the paint on a pilot metro and get a unique and good pen but if you want something really cool get like two or maybe three and look up how to get an artificial patina on a metro. I say three because that way who if you mess up you have two and youll probably improve by the third or you will just have three to get the best possible. The others could be gifts or sold or whatever.  . Favorite paper probably vintage onion skin paper from a redditor. Favorite ink might be J Herbin emerald of chivor or noodlers Antietam.,fountainpens,d2x4764,2,t5_2s0ew

7657200,0,t1_d3cgwed,I would suggest that you try to get the ink. Pretty much all the reviews say that its a great color that compliments the pen nicely and I totally agree with that. The only thing Im not sure of is if it has a sheen. I see pictures of the ink and it has a sheen but when I write with it I cant see the sheen. But thats probably due to the fact that I have an EF nib. ,fountainpens,d3ckx7r,2,t5_2s0ew
7660541,0,t1_d3cx7pl,Great to hear from you! Just for the record I dont mix ink and bleach! I add bleach to my artwork by drawing with bleach using a dip pen and zebra G nib or add drops of bleach with a brush to a wet area of ink or a dry area depending on what effect I wish to achieve. Bleach is corrosive which is why I create most of my ink and bleach art on a heavy lb watercolour paper. To help prevent fading and further deterioration I seal my work with a water based aerosol varnish once finished. All of these measures are mentioned on my blog site Regarding online art communities Im still trying to find them. And by that I mean communities that wish to engage with our genre of art. As far as Im aware most people I talk to have never heard of ink and bleach and those that have associate it with art college and student foundation work using Quink black ink. If you know of any communities who are into ink and bleach on a decent level please point me in the right direction? N,fountainpens,d3cykip,2,t5_2s0ew

Your best bet is Palmers Business Method of monoline calligraphy. Youve probably seen it or variants of it in uInkluminati s posts among others.

It was not made or promoted by Pilot.I got my Falcon SEF for  all taxes and shipping included. I got my Falcon SF for  all taxes and shipping included. I dont know what prices youre used to but for a gold nib with Rhodium trim  I think this is quite reasonable.In fact the only gold nib pens Im aware of that are less expensive are imported Pilot Custom Heritage s and Platinum  Century pens.So I respect your sentiment and I understand not wanting to drop this kind of money on a pen  but I wouldnt hold the unreasonable expectations against Pilot.

8266386,0,t3_4soa9v,Some of these comments are great for everyday pen use. Pilot VPs are great to use theyre very useful on the go and they have the click mechanism that makes it very convenient . The LAMY K is a great choice as well its light and has a reliable piston fill and a very smooth nib.  Try this one out before buying I think because some people complain about the small sweet spot on the pen.  If you grip doesnt fit well with the pen it could feel scratchy. A Parker  would be an incredible pen.  Super reliable and regarded as one of the best pens of all time fountain or not.  If you get a restored vac or an aero itll last a lifetime.  I prefer the area for the ease of clean and ink changes.  They take a little bit to clean they were meant to be used everyday so people generally just refill.  That being said this is one one of my favorite pens.. Pelikan M models have a very good reputation for everyday use pens and they have a good ink capacity.  If you ever wnat to change the nib you can with these pens too because you can put an older m nib on them.. Ranga Pens  solid ebonite pens that can be used as an eyedropper if you find that you need that much ink or as a convertercartridge pen.  The higher end models use  jowo nibs whcih can be changed around and are very smooth. These ebonite pens are super sturdy and come in different colors.

Down the rabbit hole we gogt Why am I even supposed to do it?The silicone oil serves to lubricate and keep the rubber in supple condition serving a similar purpose as engine oil within a car engine. Lubing the piston with silicon grease will keep the piston action smooth as well as ensuring a proper seal.gt How often do I need to grease it?I would disassemble amp lube it only when the piston becomes extremely difficult to turn. Most of the time it means that the rubber needs extra grease but sometimes it can also mean a lack of lube on the piston screw. The latter would require some heavier lube like bearing grease.gtHow do I do it?I put a drop of the grease in between the two ridges of the piston then spread it even across its diameter.

8387398,0,t1_d5pw05l,First I do want to point out that  CAD for a GVFC precious wood fountain pen is a pretty sweet deal. They are basically the same price that Ive seen at least in USD which means  CAD ends up being  off give or take a few percent points depending on the current exchange rate. So if its something youre interested in and it really does seem like it youre probably better off going with what you were interested in over what others recommend. Dont let others sway you with what they like better particularly with comments about the metal grips though that is something to keep in mind if youve not used a pen with metal grips and perhaps want to try out ahead of time it doesnt makebreak the pen for most people. I love my  Omas Arte Italiana in liquid vision blue and that has a very slick metal grip.Anyways keeping that in mind heres a few pens on my list in that general price range of  CAD  USD.   Visconti Homo Sapiens Bronze Age It will be roughly this price after the  VAT tax from La Couronne du Comte and another  from PENHABIT or BROWN but note the latter  can only be used onceActually speaking of La Couronne du Comte they have that Precious wood fountain pen for  Euros  CAD before any discount meaning youll at most be paying .change CAD and can get it as low as . CAD. You wont get to try it out in person but youre saving about  off of what you had intended to pay for it.   At least I think thats the one youre talking about. The  off wont show until you make an account and list your address as outside of the Eurozone. You can also special order nibs not readily available on it such as an extrafine or an obliquemedium or obliquebroad. However you will not get a chance to try it out ahead of time. Just something to keep in mind  Entrylevel Nakaya pen  Sailor King of Pen from Engeika or other japanese retailer where its not going to be nearly k though ideally Id save a bit more and get a specialty nib on it too  Platinum Izumo  Namiki Dragonfly or other entrylevel Makie pen in the Nippon Art series if that doesnt tickle your fancy  Pelikan M depending where you look the M M and M can all be found in this price range  Delta Queen of Egypt Nefertiti   Delta King of Egypt Tutankhamen Additionally you could always look for slightly higherend pens used not unheard of to get the likes of a MB for that price range used or simply save a bit of money towards the next purchase and get a less expensive pen.  ,fountainpens,d5pz0p8,1,t5_2s0ew

Very black well behaved perfect flow not gushing wet but nowhere in the neighborhood of dry and refuses to feather on anything but the cheapest of paper. It even wrote on cardboard without feathering. It pretty much screams quality its worth the ish dollars I spent for it more so than the other expensive ink brands Ive tried. SHEEN Yes it has a copper sheen. Its a bit underwhelming for the sheen lover but its there. Since Ive never found a sheening black Im not complaining its just not as dramatic as most of my sheeners. This may be partly due to the black color dampening things. WATER RESISTANCE Pretty decent. I put the card under the faucet and ran it for  seconds or so and you can see the results. COLOR Very deep black with blue undertones and copper sheen. Its an interesting black that if you look closely becomes black blueblack and copper. Its also one of the darker blacks Ive tested.

Also used Clairefontaine and Maruman Mnemosyne with quick tests on cardboard regular office paper and junk mail envelope paper.

8726021,0,t3_4zj90x,As others have pointed out  your best bet is clearly to order an imported Pilot Custom  Pilot Custom Heritage  or Platinum  Century. So Ill add a little infoI would describe the Pilots nibs as smooth with muffled feedback. You feel the pen on the page but its definitely not scratchy. The Pilot  nib on the  and  is much smaller than what Platinum offers on the  Century for the same price.Pilot Custom Heritage  has blunt ends. Its available in black Yamabudo grape red Tsukiyo midnight blue and Yamaguri brown. I have all  well brown arrives tomorrow and they are beautiful as a set. The pen looks tastefully modern with a simple sword shaped clip.Pilot Custom  has torpedocigar shaped ends. Rounded off. The clip has a ball on the end of it. Its a classic older looking pen IMHO. It too is available in some colors black deep red deep blue deep green.The Platinum  Century is an interesting pen. The nib is huge! In a good way. The nib is actually larger than Pilots  nib from the much more expensive PCH. The  Century nibs are said to have more feedback and it can be an acquired taste. These pens are not scratchy like cheap pens  theyre still smooth  but theres this feeling of very direct feedback. You really feel the surface of the page.This Platinum feedback is startling at first and someone new to fountain pens might think it was scratchy. But Ive owned cheap bad scratchy pens and this is not that. Once I got used to it I loved it so much I have  now.Sometimes these Japanese nibs arrive with the tines too tight. Flow is improved for me by working an index card between the tines and letting it sit for a few minutes at a time. Its a simple thing that can make a world of difference if youre used to wet writing Western pens.Remember that Japanese pens run finer than Western. If you like a Lamy EF for example  plan for a Japanese F.I would even recommend going with an M nib if youre not into very fine nibs.These are all great pens though and its awesome to have gold nibs at this price point.,fountainpens,d6we870,10,t5_2s0ew

It is prone to staining although I find Noodlers North African Violet is much more. Id be wary of putting it in many vintage pens because they could use different plastics. And even if its generally safe its kind of a weird ink which makes it a bit unpredictable. One of the more real dangers is that it doesnt like other inks and can form precipitates in an inadequately cleaned pen. Which is why its commonly advised to give it its own cheap pen. Its kind of unpractically bright so its not a hardship. I like it in a Platinum Preppy though a jinhao would also suit. ,fountainpens,d6x7km8,7,t5_2s0ew

8856238,0,t3_51j9m3,. A few days is fine.  If its a week or longer the pen nib may be a little dry and you can dip it in water to restart it.. It should be OK.  Worst might be you see some ink leakage into the cap which wont permanently damage the pen.  If you come across this issue or get ink on your hands when using the pen you might want to use a separate case for your pen that you carry in your backpack..  Depends on the paper the ink and the nib size and wetness.  Only way to know is try it on the specific paper youre concerned about.  There are definitely cheaper options than Rhodia.  Black n Red notebooks are a good option and can be found on Amazon but there are also some cheaper options.,fountainpens,d7ce7sz,1,t5_2s0ew

In the s and s colored plastics were cuttingedge and modern after having had nothing but gutta percha and early forms of bakelite. That was what people wanted and thats what companies made.There were metal pens back in the day and they were quite popular. Fabulously ornate things in sterling silver nickelplated brass goldfilled or gold plate with chasing engraving and even engine turning on them. They were dip pen holders though usually with tapers made of banded agate or motherofpearl and theyd looked pretty much the same from the American civil war onward. By the time fountain pens were really a thing that sort of design was very oldfashioned. Some really really early FPs had chasedengravedturned metal bodies and BHR sections but clearly that wasnt what the market wanted.

In this case I would be called a process engineer starting out and what I would do is test the chemical processes and machinery at each point and analyze everything in order to optimize the processes. There is also research and development with a masters or PhD. Paper products are a little different than say pharmaceuticals though because each tree is slightly different or you could use a different species or even hardwood versus softwood and then be making cardboard versus paper versus dissolving tissue paper versus fluff pulp which is the basis of diapers for example not to mention each chemical process along the way to optimize and then chemicals to add in order to improve certain qualities in the final product.,fountainpens,d8odc1r,4,t5_2s0ew

Well in any case Ill leave my response up there as I feel that its still interesting.OK so writing with the nib flipped! Thats what you mean. Yes this is fine. If your nibs slit is parallel from top to bottom then you will be able to do this. If the slits taper narrows towards the bottom then capillary action can limit your ability to do this as the ink will be drawn toward the bottom of the nib.  This is actually something that we shoot for when tuning our nibs. Its a nice feature to have a nib that can be flipped to write a little finer than the writing side.,fountainpens,dabk73g,2,t5_2s0ew

9738721,0,t3_5ek2hn,So Im thinking it could be several things.. Replacing the sac with a converter maybe its not quite as tight fit as you think and air is getting into it.. There could be dried ink or paper fibres stuck in the nib try flushing the entire grip section nib and feed out with warm water and a bulb syringe to add a bit of water pressure and maybe soak it for a little while.. It could easily be the ink try a different ink.  Some inks will be clingy and not lubricated.  You can see this if you ink up the converter and then tip the pen upside down does the ink flow nicely in the converter or does it seem to be stuck still in the converter and not flow?  If its stuck then take a syringe suck up the smaller blob of dish soap and put one drop of it from the syringe into the converter.  Place back onto the pen turn the pen upside down a few times to try and mix the dish soap now try writing.  Once youve written a few sentences you should find that the ink will flow much better and wont run dry.If  and  dont fix it then I suspect you either have some really stubborn fibres stuck in the nib or feed or that its something to do with the converter youve added.,fountainpens,dadidch,3,t5_2s0ew

I had to do it too and now it writes very nicely.Ironically the one thing an Ahab will never be really good at is flexing. Its a semiflex nothing more  and not a very good one at that.

9929004,0,t1_db1rn4c,Yeah I changed very early on how I uncap a pen because I would find that you could even get ink splatters come off the nib entirely onto the desk hand paper.  For the most part being gentle and pushing the cap off with your thumb of the hand thats holding onto the barrel helps in a lot of cases.As youre still getting ink coming off on the Metropolitan then it could be that your nibfeed isnt squarely inserted or theres a manufacturing defect or it could just be the nature of the Metropolitan that the breather hole the cap just isnt big enough to equalise the pressure.  Another way to try hold the pen vertical but with the nibcap at the top now try to uncap the Metropolitan.  Youre using gravity now and this might be the easiest way to avoid getting ink on the nibfeed.So one way to tell if its the nibfeed not fitting snugly is just to hold the pen vertical with the nib facing down and gently shake the pen up and down with a writing pad or kitchen towel underneath it does ink easily get onto the nib and feed in large quantities or even drop off onto the pad or kitchen towel?  If it does then its more likely nothing to do with the cap or breather hole on the cap and its the nibfeed.  In which case I would take the cartridge out flush the grip section through with water and then try to remove the nib and feed and reseat it.  Maybe its only  of the way into the grip section and thats causing a leak.  You may want to check YouTube videos on how to remove the nib on a Metropolitan as I dont know if its friction fitted and you pull it out or if its a screw in nibfeed.,fountainpens,db1rw56,1,t5_2s0ew

9989525,0,t1_db9n3ag,In my opinion the Lamy Safari is a decent pen. Probably. You picked ANOTHER controversial one. You have a knack for that! Ive only ever used one and I wasnt thrilled with it. The grip section is sort of triangular but has a rounded bottom. Some love it some hate it. Im somewhere in the middle. I can use it and if I spent more time on it I might like it but it wasnt the WOW moment that some people have with Safaris.The nib on the one I got I wound up giving the pen to my girlfriend by the way. She loves the pen was super misaligned and one tine was longer than the other. Ive heard that theres a particular size of Lamy nibs that are spotty on quality control but I dont remember which one. Mine was a medium. Took a couple hours of work to get it writing acceptably. Still not what Id call a good nib but many love theirs so mine was probably just a bad example.The aesthetics are again eh for me. I guess you can make your own judgement there. I figure the matte finished ones would be more pleasant to hold though. Mine was I liked the matte but its my only matte pen ever so not a big deal to me.The cap is a slip on cap not screw on like most fountain pens. Its less secure than either the Metro or the Preppy but still not too bad. The clip is decent. Wont tear up a shirt or anything but its not super strong or super weak. Right there in the middle.I probably wouldnt recommend a Safari personally. A TWSBI Eco is also kinda controversial but Ive had better experience with TWSBIs than Lamy. Im not a huge fan of my Lamy  either. A Kaweco Sport might be good too. Those are both in the same price range as a Safari.A second bottle of ink might be a good choice too. Diamine Noodlers and J. Herbin are all good brands. Check out the Goulet Pens Swab shop for samples of a TON of inks. Diamine Sherwood Green is a favorite of mine,fountainpens,db9nv7p,2,t5_2s0ew

10179006,0,t3_5lixqb,Its good enough for my needs. They look nice are under  and take a nice variety of nibs. Like others say the nibs are much better than the bodies if you can get the solid versions its probably less prone to cracking. As it stands mine hasnt broken yet but the nib does dry out once in a whilenothing a quick prime cant fix.If youre looking for the lowest possible pricepoint you can get a Jinhao X from eBay and a Nemosine nib F.mm I believe? and get a very good writer.,fountainpens,dbxuhf8,1,t5_2s0ew

10193688,0,t3_5ly682,Namisu makes a few pens in that category aluminum probably anodized plus they have Bock nibs. Downside I think Namisus catalog is pretty strictly sansclip which may or may not be a dealbreaker and theyre not designed for the cap to be posted. Personally I have a Namisu Orion Im not crazy about due to the lack of a clip and the unpostable cap. Wrote just fine though.The Schrade tactical pen is OK as a writer generic IPG nib but really does work OKbutnotgreat and is also allmetal aluminum but the look of the thing is maybe not what youre after. Mine is an older model but I expect the current iteration is about equivalent aside from appearance. This is also a pretty large pen. I wouldnt really recommend this but it was inexpensive and as I noted writes better than expected.Levenger offers the LTech which I think has a brass barrel. Its aesthetically similar to the Rotring  but larger heavier and with a traditionallystyled nib. I wasnt real impressed with mine which is an older version than the currently available model.A question is there a particular functional problem you are hoping to solve with an allmetal pen or is this strictly an aesthetic consideration?ETA as far as pens I havent laid hands on and havent been otherwise mentioned Kawecos got the Lilliput brass copper or steel and some allmetal brass or aluminum versions of the Sport. I havent tangled with a metal Kaweco though I do have a Kaweco Sport which I find too small to be a comfortable writer YMMV.,fountainpens,dbzie27,2,t5_2s0ew

10196539,0,t1_dbzn77c,Its difficult if not impossible to gauge with the naked eye if the tines are truly aligned. Youll need to look at the tines with a magnifying glass or loupe if you have one. Misaligned tines are a very common cause of scratchiness.Are the nibs the same size? Generally larger nibs are smoother than finer nibs.How do you hold your pens? If you play with the angles at which you write can you find a smooth spot on the Vista?Finally it could come down to your own preference. My Vistas nib was hard as a nail and I dont prefer that so I didnt like the way it wrote. Some people do prefer firmer nibs though so sometimes it just depends on your taste.While Im not a huge fan of the VistaSafariAlstar line for the feel of the nib my Vista wrote as well as my other entrylevel pens Eco Metro Preppy so if the Lamy is truly writing significantly worse than the Bic then something is off with your pen.,fountainpens,dbzu190,2,t5_2s0ew

10212367,0,t3_5m8dto,My grandfather used to write with a fountain pen and as a child I was fascinated with it. He kept it on his desk in a stand and he would scold me for trying to touch it. One evening I snuck into his study while everyone slept and uncapped the fountain pen. I touched the tip of the nib since that was my favorite part. Ink flowed freely from the end and I got a little carried away feeling the ink on my skin. I capped the pen and went to bed. The next morning my family found me with blue ink stains all over the sheets bluestained palms and ink all around my mouth.My grandfather started hiding his pen after that. ,fountainpens,dc1mo71,5,t5_2s0ew

10238018,0,t1_dc4ebrl,Yep thats a solid guide. If youre sure  youre getting ink to the nib but it just wont write then the issue is probably the ties being too far apart or the nib isnt touching the feed as it should be. Both of those are covered in the instructions you linked. One thing to be aware of with cartridges is that you cant really force ink through the feed like you can with a converter. You have to rely on gravity so that can take a while. I tend to use the put a paper towel over the nib and flick it downwards method but that can be dangerous if youre not sure you have a good grip. Others will hold the back of the pen nib down and sort of make a stirring motion to move the ink into the feed. If you didnt clean the pen before you inked it then that could have a deleterious effect too. It wouldnt be a terrible idea to clean it if you havent done that yet. Old dried up ink in the feed could make inkflow difficult or impossible. ,fountainpens,dc4jbn6,2,t5_2s0ew

10318740,0,t1_dcdn0t6,If you have a bunt tip syringe you can flush out and refill the cartridge with your ink of choice so no need to mess with it to make it into an eyedropper... unless you want the extra volume then go for it.  Follow the process youve already outlined.As for the midrange I have all of the AL limited eds and I like them because then I can color code the ink and not have to constantly wonder what color is in the pen or try to decipher what it is by sloshing the ink around.  The Eco should be the same nib in a different packaging for less money but whether you go Eco or  is basically an aesthetic choice if you dont mind the added cost for the .  The Eco wasnt out when I bought my first  so it was a null choice for me.The Vac would be great if youre cool with the amount of time necessary to flush and clean a vac between inks.  I have one nonTWSBI vac in my stable and if the nib wasnt awesome I wouldnt still have it.  As it is Ive put one ink and only one ink in it and until the bottle runs dry I dont think I would be putting any other ink in there.  Its a pain to get every last smudge of ink out and since it is a demonstrator you can see everywhere the ink has infiltrated.  I know its actually a function of me being analretentive about cleaning but thats my take on vac fillers.Everyone I know who has a Lamy Safari uses it like their workhorse.  I havent heard anything truly bad about those pens.  If I could get over the grip I would probably have one.,fountainpens,dcdoomg,1,t5_2s0ew

10368724,0,t3_5ohqyy,Heres another new pen for today the Edison Pearlette.  I knew this would be a little smaller than my regular like for oversized pens but hadnt realised how small it would be its not that far off a Waterman Hemisphere both in length and also girth.  However I actually do really like the size of the pen.  The pen is super lightweight at g uncapped or g capped.  This is probably the first pen that I actually really feel the need to cap the pen because of its small length.  That said because of the g capped weight the pen caps extremely well and is not topback heavy. The Edison Pearlette is a cartridge converter pen and I picked this up with a steel M nib and it writes extremely smooth the way I like my nibs.Ive added some photos and compared the Pearlette to the Persimmon Swirl in size so you can see the size difference.Pros Love the design of the pen and how it sparkles Love how the nib writes Love that its a cartridge converter easy to clean and fillCons I would prefer to have this in a larger size of pen with the same design if I had the choice As its made of resin the pen smells when uncapping or if you smell the inside of the cap.  Brings me back several decades back to turning plastic on a lathe at school that burning plastic type smell.  Ive heard this smell will disappear after about a year but its one downside if you dont like your pens to smell.EDIT  Updated with video link below,fountainpens,dcjcuxl,5,t5_2s0ew

10375160,0,t3_5ojacy,As everyone else has mentioned a Japanese M nib or a European F will fit the width youre looking for. This also happens to be my preferred range in most pens as well.As for brandsLike others have said TWSBI and Pilot both have offerings in your price range Pilot having the Metro Kakuno and Prera TWSBI having the Eco Mini and . However if youd like to explore other brands there are a few options.. Lamy Safari Vista or ALStar  While a lot of Americans find Lamys entry level pens to be overpriced compared to Metros or Ecos theyre still a solid workhorse offering. The bonus of Lamy is that their nibs are easily interchangeable and inexpensive so if you want to try a new nib say a stub or a western broad you can do so without having to buy a new pen. Lamys are also pretty darn tough. Their EF nibs tend to be hitormiss but the F nibs and larger should be reliable. My Lamy F is spoton.. Kaweco Sport Skyline Sport and Ice Sport  Kaweco makes excellent little pocket pens that fit anywhere and feel very nice inhand though you do have to use them posted. You can also eyedropper their pens for a huge ink capacity perfect for long writing sessions. One caveat is that Kaweco nibs can be a bit temperamental prone to babys bottom or other issues. However if you buy from an authorized dealer Kaweco has good customer service for defective nibs. Also their acrylic Sport line of pens is inexpensive enough that you can afford to send the pen to a nibmeister for a custom grind if its not up to your standards.. FaberCastell Loom  A lot of people say that FaberCastells nibs are some of the best at this price point. The Loom is a simple modernlooking pen that features their famous nibs for an entry level price. This pen is a little heftier so if youre looking for a light pen this might not be the choice for you. However if you like heft and a nice nib you cant go wrong here.. Platinum Plaisir Cool and Balance  Platinum has some of my favorite gold nibs their soft fine is almost always in my rotation but their steel nibs are also great. The Plaisir is their Metropolitanequivalent though its not quite as nice an offering. The Cool and Balance are virtually the same with the Cool being a silvertoned demonstrator version of the more classic Balance. As these are Japanese pens the focus tends to be more on the nib than the body. Youll get a better price ordering direct from Japan though the shipping cost may offset this price difference.I hope this helps!,fountainpens,dck35bk,1,t5_2s0ew

10397368,0,t1_dcmcsei,I started off typing an answer to What exactly is the essence of the Palmer method? as in what makes it different from the others but then I realized that wasnt what you asked. Ill try to be a bit more general.If youre writing a lot of text the most important rule is consistency which older methods drill and establish intently with strict rules not generally deviating from them in the name of making the letter forms more similar to printed text. If you look at this excerpt from Theory of the Spencerian Method of Practical Penmanship you can see how much the letter forms are designed with the intent of making the hand do almost exactly the same thing consistently the e is narrow the hump of the n matches the leading stroke and is the same as the exit stroke but upside down which naturally creates the correct angles and spacing for the i etc. This changes the focus from drawing the next letter to modifying the word according to what letters are needed. After all when you read you dont look at each letter separately so why should you be drawing each letter independently of each other when writing?If you even have such rules for your capitals you end up with both beautiful forms and a way to create consistency that helps your brain learn. Heres an example from Modern Business Penmanship that really illustrates this fantastically  the capital W contains a finial lowercase t. Great book by the way  I just didnt link it before because I havent really been through it yet. As long as you can see the theory going on you can adapt ideas from different sources into your own writing so I love books like that one that give all the breakdowns.I do think the Palmer Method in particular is a little weak in that area both the breakdowns and having consistent rules for the capital letters but its certainly better than this nooooo and god forbid even thisAnother thing to consider is that theres a reason all these things have Method in their name  in these cases theyre not just designing the scripts themselves but focusing largely on forming the letters so that the method of learning that they outline in their books matches and reflects the letters themselves. Thats why there are so many drills besides just forming each letter over and over again and why certain letters are often featured more heavily than others. Dont get me wrong its great to learn what the letters are like but its also great to learn to write!,fountainpens,dcmlwag,2,t5_2s0ew

10519644,0,t3_5qmwgy,Oranges pinks reds tend to have more dye in them so will inherently run a little dry compared to a regular black or blue ink providing they dont have additional lubrication properties.  However if your pen is a pretty wet writer then its because the gap in the tines is wider allowing more ink flow.  Opening up the tines flossing with brass shim usually helps make a nib write wetter but to make a nib write more dry is a bit more difficult because you have to bend the tines one over the other to try and force the tines to close up then you have to realign the tines etc.  Changing ink probably wont make a huge difference but you could try a high saturation ink but then it might not be appropriate for some work places it might make a slight difference.  As its a Montblanc you could have it serviced by Montblanc and ask them to make it more of a dry writer not sure how long or how much it would takecost or you could potentially take it to a nibmeister and have them do it.Typically you will get more shading when a nib is broader medium or greater and if its a wet writer and if youre using vellum paper like Rhodia Clairefontaine Leuchtturm Tomoe River.  You can try to use more absorbent paper that might reduce the shadingsheening aspects but could then cause spreading bleed through and feathering.I also tend to find inks like Waterman tend not to shade that much relatively cheap and are very well behaved in most pens.  Maybe give them a try first?,fountainpens,dd0ikb1,4,t5_2s0ew

Theres still gold nibs for sure but the art of making a good flex nib which usually means wide but short in length shoulders and a very very long set of tines has been lost.  To invest the money in machines to make those nibs would be pretty costly.

10874519,0,t3_5v4orb,hi guys! i was hoping you can all be of some help. im getting back into fountain pens after a long time and i got myself a kakuno fine nib from pilot. an awesome little pen although the thing that drives me crazy is the face on the nib. So my question to all of you is it possible to replace the nib on it? and any tutorials on how to do so as ive never had to replace one before. or if you have any suggestions on pens that are good for every day writing that arent lamyi dislike them or overly ornate but have a modern appeal. id buy a pilot metropolitan but i get a very old business vibe form them ,fountainpens,de1mnx1,1,t5_2s0ew

10917538,0,t3_5vz1o0, That link will take you to all the cartridges that Pilot makes. Any of the cartridges made by Pilot will fit your metropolitan just make sure Pilot makes them Pilot is also called Namiki sometimes same cartridges just a different name which I believe is used in JapanAs for bottled ink the pen should have came with something called a converter which looks like a little rubber sac with a hole on the end. To use it youd put it in your pen just like a cartridge and dip the pen into a bottle of ink up to the grip section and squeeze the rubber sac firmly  to  times which will fill it up with ink.Any bottled ink will work as long as it is fountain pen ink. Dont use calligraphy ink as it will ruin your pen. As long as you stick to jetpens or goulet pens really any website that sells fountain pens you should be safe. Pilot makes some really nice inks in a line called iroshizuku but it cost about  a bottle but its good and consistent and has amazing qualities. Wont bleed through paper and wont feather except on really really bad paper. Heres a link to iroshizuku inks   The link below is to all the bottles of ink on jetpens. Any of these inks will work in your pen. Id really recommend Pilot inks though theyre great. Noodlers is also a very good and very inexpensive ink made in the U.S. This last link is too Brian goulet of the goulet pen companys YouTube playlist called fountain pen . It will teach you all you need to know about fountain pens and fountain pen maintenance! Hope all this helps!,fountainpens,de62f61,4,t5_2s0ew

11023453,0,t1_dehh1yh,Tearing paper is a bit strange but most certainly you just had a dry nib. Let me be clear  most of my Pilot pens have had this issue. Every once in a while I get one that just magically works but most required at least minor adjustment. Likewise a friend ordered  gold nibbed Pilots and had to return  for this reason! Its very common.To test your pen try holding it by its tail and dragging it across paper. Drag it down side to side up and down. Is there ink? This is a test to see if the pen releases ink under its own weight.Some pens only release ink with pressure. Whats happening is pressure spreads the tines and allows the ink to flow... but then there is no pressure spreading the tines on an upstroke so no ink flows! See? and if there is pressure on the paper on an upstroke and there is no ink   now you have dry metal pushing hard against paper. See what I mean?I used to write at a steeper angle but Ive evolved toward holding pens at a lower angle.If you write higher you would probably enjoy a Pilot WA nib!  But youre best off evolving toward a lower writing angle. ,fountainpens,dehh8em,1,t5_2s0ew

It made it more comfortable for her to hold I guess thats because of the way the barrel rests between her thumb and her index finger? Not sure... She also said that the weight made her feel like the pen would hold itself in place in her hand and against the paper and that it enhanced her feeling of the pen sliding across the paper while writing. Not sure if this answers your question but that is what she said. She didnt say anything about the cap but I watched her use the pen so I guess she uncapped it without trouble. She also tried to write with my Pilot Metro grip was too thin for her to hold comfortably and my Waterman Hemisphere same and way too light. She started to glow and smile when she tried the Loom she loved it so much she almost started to cry and me too because its beautiful to watch someone who hasnt been able to write much for more than a decade rediscover something she used to love.,fountainpens,del6wiq,2,t5_2s0ew

Third place is the most difficult spot to fill.  I would say my Fermo because I love the stub Mark Bacas put on the nib.  I write more with my Lamy though.  As is Id say the Fermo edges it out.

I suppose the odds of an accident are higher but once you break the habit of pressing a penpencil into paper and only apply force if any on downstrokes writing with a flex pen can be just as functionalreasonable as any other nib.I used a vintage Wahl with a Signature flex nib in it for the entirety of a neurology course with no issue.,fountainpens,dfmf162,3,t5_2s0ew

11505142,0,t3_647chl,My experience is limited to modern pens Ive tried a half dozen vintage pens and they dont agree with me.Even with modern iron gall and micro pigment inks I have yet to see any actual evidence that it damages pens. Everyone always says to be careful with it but some people leave it in for weeks without problems some for months and others for years. I dont remember reading a single account of either type of ink damaging a pen just people telling you to take extra care with them now accounts of ink staining feeds and converters like Noodlers Baystate Blue are another thing they are fairly easy to find. That having been said I no longer pay any attention to whether the ink is modern iron gall or micro pigment and Ive had ink sit in pen for months on end without anything bad happening to them.Some inks do stain feeds or converters but since most feeds are black how can you really tell that they get stained? Since most converters are hidden by the pen what difference does it really make?

11734960,0,t1_dgq5ln3,Kingdom note and Sekaido are great spots! Except when Kingdom note has new LE pens and ink out and Im not in town to get any Their wall of ink is definitely a sight to behold. Sekaido being nearby is a big plus too! I pass by both stores at least once or twice every trip. Oddly enough Sekaido had no Pilot Petits on sale last month I usually buy a bunch of them and preppies for students and converting purposes. I also pass by Itoya and a few other places to walk around theres always lots to see. Did you manage to make it to Morita in Osaka? Cash only but  off mrsp is a good deal. Nagasawa I will willingly pay full price for their store exclusives. And have done so     Pelikan has historically been very popular in Japan  Pelikan even made C nib ms for the Japanese market back in the early s. In more recent decades MB has taken the spot but both brands are highly revered and I have heard the locals dont value their domestic brands as highly as the the German duo. Doesnt stop the store limited exclusives from selling out though!    Thank you for the jiro recommendation Ill keep it in mind for next year.

11742497,0,t3_67jpme,When I had the same thing happen to me I opted for a TWSBI Diamond Mini and a Sheaffers Imperial II vintage. But now Id probably recommend  TWSBI Eco  Pilot Metropolitan   Pilot Prera  FaberCastell Loom Or if you want to go vintage Peyton Street Pens has an excellent selection without the risk of getting a dud or something that needs restoration. You may be able to find better prices for those pens on a seller like Amazon I see Preras for much less fyi but I just listed off the normal US retailer price at someone like Goulet Pens or Anderson Pens. ,fountainpens,dgr1iqi,4,t5_2s0ew

Theyre extra fine and fine respectively and I know now that I only care vintage flex broad and stubs. Theyre both iconic designs and served as the catalyst for plunging headlong into the inescapable hell that is collecting vintage pens. I can look at them and blame any exorbitant Waterman purchases on them. I keep them around for scapegoating purposes.,fountainpens,dgr8uqe,12,t5_2s0ew

My soft fine heritage is alot smoother than the  thoughslightly dry tines too tight a little flossing made it better but it has the definitive pencil feedback which I quite likeThese  comes with many nib options such as soft fine that gives some line variation and is rather enjoyable to write with.
