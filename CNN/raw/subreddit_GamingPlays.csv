10731047,0,t3_5tixm9,Some Terran buildings can be lifted off the ground for various reasons. Here it looks like the Terran wanted to swap which building was using the addon which allows the buildings to produce more units at once or additional types of units.The Zerg player took this perfect moment to attack. Terran players usually use buildings to wall off their bases so that enemy units cant swarm in. Unfortunately while he was swapping buildings the Zerg player put lings under the spot on the ramp preventing the enemy buildings from landing. He continually kept pairs of lings directly under the buildings so that they couldnt land until the huge force came to finish off the base.,GamingPlays,ddmtsky,1,t5_3izhd
