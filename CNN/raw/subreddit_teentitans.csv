5659747,0,t3_3r0sto,Slade is unmatched. He was the main villain for at least  of the series. Dominated the first two seasons came back as a hallucination favorite episode by far came back as a demon. Yeah its definitely Slade.,teentitans,cwyn9wk,2,t5_2sc3o

6814013,0,t3_44vjc0,The main issue I have with it right now is that it is constantly playing on Cartoon Network leaving little to no room for the half decent shows like Adventure Time and Regular Show.

7397627,0,t3_4ewbks,Not being a dick just dont get your hopes up folks its likely that the screen writes have moved on and licencing animation studios is a nightmare but I will say that this is a good time.  If not mistaken the team for teen titans was a Japanese one and awfully pricy but the yen is much weaker then the dollar now and the Japanese economy is in a decline to clarify it has been for a while but what was a very slow dip has increased more at an alarming rate so maybe they could strike a good deal.

10084522,0,t3_5k69n7,I think there was this rivalry between Beast Boy and Aqualad because in the beginning we saw how Beast Boy was hyped that it would be an underwater mission and that he could be the only one that can breathe underwater with his ability to transform into sea animals and then Aqualad just swooshes in and saves the Titans and the first moment when I knew Beast Boy was kind of jealous was when the whales brought them to Aqualads lair and Raven was blushing and thanking Aqualad and then Beast Boy just shows up sayingHE SAVED YOU HELLOO I WAS THERE TOO YOU KNOW.But at the end they still worked their differences out and if it wasnt for Aqualad they couldve never defeated Trident. My favorite moment was at the end when they were saying goodbye and Raven and Starfire were just popping out of every angle with heart eyes and making Aqualad feel awkward D ,teentitans,dbm15j7,1,t5_2sc3o

10506602,0,t1_dcyl82u,Most people watch horror because they want to get scared I guess? Raven may be a halfdemon that is a fearless sorceress but Arellas half makes her a normal human being prone to fear.,teentitans,dcz19cx,1,t5_2sc3o

11375826,0,t3_61tqyu,I think that in terms of story arc its the second strongest next to . Terra is a really great character however I think she could have been implemented better. Most notably I feel she flips too many times for any sort of redemption to have the maximum emotional impact. What I mean by this is she starts off with the Titans flips to Slade trys to flip back to the Titans but is shunned by beast boy full commits to Slade then in the end changes back to the Titans. I feel it gets repeatitive and predictable and loses its impact after a while. Because of this I think the episode with the house of Mirrors is really weak because Beast boy kinda goes out of character to create terras motivation. All in all the season is really good I just feel it could have been handled even better.,teentitans,dflfi7k,2,t5_2sc3o
