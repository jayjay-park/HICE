1225450,0,t3_284ws1,There really is no second course on discrete math as discrete math is just an introductory course to various subjects set theory a little logic combinatorics graph theory probability etc... usually offered to computer science students.You may enjoy Concrete Mathematics by Graham Patashnik and Knuth Titu Andreescu writes lots of books to prepare people for math olympiads and he has a text that teaches to solve various combinatorial problems If you liked generating functions you may really enjoy Wilfs generatingfunctionology  nd edition is available for free on his websiteSome fun with combinatorics  eBook can be purchased from publishers websiteAnd maybe youd enjoy combinatorial game theory This is just off the top of my head. There are also some rather graduate combinatorics texts such as Richard Stanleys Enumerative Combinatorics which might scare you .,mathbooks,ci7hc7y,3,t5_2r6fl
2974623,0,t3_2u7xrz,To add to utinyewell Spivaks Calculus is pretty excellent I did my second tour of duty through Calculus with it. It follows the current trend of derivatives first and integrals later. Its problems are more proof oriented whereas Apostol has plenty of computational problems. There is a lot of exposition but it does give definition theorem proof rinse and repeat. You will not however learn many techniques for computation. If you really want to get into Calculus on a theoremproof basis you can move up to Rudins Principals of Real Analysis however this tackles what is essentially Calculus on another level. I wish I had this for my third tour of duty through Calculus. His proof of LHopitals rule is to me absolutely lovely. You will not learn how to answer any problems you might find on a typical calculus  exam at all. In fact youll have no sense for why any of it is important or why its useful. ,mathbooks,co68ary,1,t5_2r6fl

Or ask them to contact you when textbooks are discarded. I know I acquired a free calculus textbook as a grad student from publisher and always see free boxes of books and journals in the hallway. Ask around!,mathbooks,cy3wwx0,2,t5_2r6fl
