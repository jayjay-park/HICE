54447,0,t3_1uq8o1,s a bit of a tough age. All the locals that age will probably be sneakily drinking in the park at weekends. Not really an ideal socialising location though. Honestly I dont think most  year olds do many activities that are the sort of dropin activity youre describing. I cant think of much I did at that age that would fall in that category. The closest I can think of is maybe some sort of church youth group but that would only really make sense if youre religious.If the weathers good you can do some great cycle rides the coast to the east of the city is beautiful although it can be very windy. Maybe get the train out to North Berwick to skip the built up stuff. If its bad dont bother. The Pentlands the hill range just south of the city are also really beautiful and once you get away from the road a bit you really wouldnt know that youre so close to a big city. You can get the bus to some of the good entry points either in Balerno or Flotterstone. see this site,Edinburgh,cekmn79,8,t5_2rffi

While I completely believe in working to earn money where possible there is a bit of a cultural difference that i could shed some light on.Roma people have a single word for working and dont really distinguish between begging selling flowers busking etc. This is because historically Roma people were kept as slaves in parts of Europe at points but instead of being fed they had  days off a week to go and earn money by whatever means they could come up with to feed themselves and their family. Not sure about other parts of Europe but I know that in Romania the Roma folk are treated really badly and I think couldnt even be citizens until  years ago. Literacyeducation is an issue as well as language so many would struggle to apply for traditional types of work. Im not trying to justify begging with iphones etc and im expecting a lot of downvotes on this I just think the background to it is quite interesting. ,Edinburgh,cq381tx,7,t5_2rffi

4199371,0,t1_cryw9sj,If youre into castles here are some suggestions beyond the obvious Edinburgh CastleHolyrood Palace combo... Get on the  bus from the city centre and visit Lauriston Castle. th century origins th century extensions and the interior has been preserved as it was in  when it was given to the nation by its last owner. The views of the Forth are incredible and the gardens are remarkable for two reasons  the Playfair design of the main garden and the Japanese Friendship garden which was a gift from Kyoto. Its also within walking distance of Cramond so if you fancy checking out ruins from the northernmost Roman barracks you can. Stirling Castle is worth the train trip  its a better tourist castle than Edinburgh in many ways quality of information layout less th century additional nonsense etc. and tends to be a little quieter. The Great Hall is amazing as is the Kings Old Building. Take a short train ride out to Linlithgow and check out the ruins of the palace. Its where Mary Queen of Scots was born. Theyre pretty extensive ruins and take a good few hours to nose around. Theres a pretty little church next door thats worth a look and a pub across the road called The Four Marys that does excellent food and real ales. Stroll round the loch feed the swans grab an ice cream... its a good day. You can also jump on the  bus and head out to Roslin to see the ruins of Rosslyn Castle. It was built in the th century got the crap kicked out of it by Cromwell in the th century then was eventually abandoned in . Its also right round the corner from Rosslyn Chapel with all its intricate carvings and grail hoaxeslegends. Well worth a look. Or you could do something completely unrelated to castles and get the  out to Gilmerton Cove which is a really odd little system of sandstone caves beneath a betting shop in a suburb. Theyre not naturally occurring caves but noone is entirely sure how they got there or what they were used for. A family lived there for about  years in the th century and claimed to have hewn them out but thats almost certainly bullshit.

Im a UI programmer from Ubisoft Montreal interviewing for a senior position there as soon as they get me out to the studio probably about  weeks.As for wage they asked me and we had a brief back and forth. Heres what I know that might help you Im . years experienced in AAA with an advanced diploma. The numbers Ill use are in GBP not CAD.Currently Im paid .k which is quite low for the area and Quebec pays some of the lowest wages across Canada and US. Locally a more fair wage would be about k. I told them I expected .K in my next roll and the recruiter at the studio kind of jumbled on his words a bit but came across to saying essentially Well not sure if you know this but Canadian studios pay much higher than in the UK but Im sure we wont have any problems. hahahaha.I expect theyre going to offer dramatically lower than .K based on the recruiters nervous laughter. Im not too worried though since my project right now is pretty great even if its not well paid. Im near the offer stages with Bethesda and am talking to two different teams at Blizzard too. Some random studio in California is claiming they would pay me K but theyre a really unknown studio and they didnt make that offer  they just said thats what senior positions go for there and they have unmatched compensation. Im taking that studio with a grain of salt.Best of luck Kazanukie I hope you get the position youre looking for! DM me if youd like to talk further.,Edinburgh,csvfy5c,1,t5_2rffi

4710896,0,t3_3ffmyf,Ive done Foodies twice and I was at the Food Festival on Thursday.Foodies is ENORMOUS in comparison and this year its meant to be  bigger than it used to be too apparently.  Its got a good selection of street food many of which are touring with it so theyre not local and you wont have had them.  Theres a good selection of booze of different types.  Pretty solid program of celebrity chefs and demonstrations and stuff and a fairly big vendors market with everything from stalls selling Jams and preserves to Mailorder meal subscriptions via Coffee Machine sellers. The Food Festival uses the space AssemblyThe Spiegeltent use during the festival at George Square  they had maybe a dozen street food places most of which were local businesses a lot of these were shut on Thursday even though it was only like pm though.  They only had a couple of market stall situations and these were all shutshutting when I was there.  Their booze is the standard Assembly Festival bar which is quite limited.  They have a program of food talksdebates and some performances later in the evening from Fringe acts  but the performances cost money.Foodies is obviously bigger and has a lot more to offer but Ive always thought its a bit shit that you have to pay to get in since you then have to buy everything once youre in there  the tickets are quite expensive considering they literally just buy your entry and nothing else.  If youve got free tickets its absolutely worth checking out.  If you didnt have free tickets and werent PARTICULARLY fussed but were mildly curious I would have said the Food Festival would probably whet your appetite and save you  or however much the Foodies tickets are.,Edinburgh,ctoci0c,1,t5_2rffi

Trains and busrs go to the borders which is my favourite place in the world I recommend Jedburgh and peebles. Also trains through Fife and up to Perth shire which is pretty too I really like Pitlochry. So yes dont need a car but can be handy when going further out. You can also take bikes on Scottish trains  if theres a bike space so you could cycle from the station at the end. For good walking maps use bing and put OS map on or download view ranger GPS you can download the OS leisure maps to your phone and these have footpath and contours on.

I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me and one of the generals called me in. He said Sir youve got to come in and talk to me a second. I said Well youre too busy. He said No no. He says Weve made the decision were going to war with Iraq. This was on or about the th of September. I said Were going to war with Iraq? Why? He said I dont know. He said I guess they dont know what else to do. So I said Well did they find some information connecting Saddam to alQaeda? He said No no. He says Theres nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq. He said I guess its like we dont know what to do about terrorists but weve got a good military and we can take down governments. And he said I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer every problem has to look like a nail.gt So I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said Are we still going to war with Iraq? And he said Oh its worse than that. He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper.
