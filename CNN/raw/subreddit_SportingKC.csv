110931,0,t1_cer0t03,As someone who has supported worldwide soccer for many years as well as the WizardsSKC during that time I was eluding to the fact that many sources during the transfer periods are usually falsified with little concrete reporting and seldom proven quotes.  With papers like The Sun Daily Mail The Mirror and twitter pundits  In the Know you can barely believe anything about a transfer until the player is holding up the jerseykit of that club.  The US isnt superior by any means with reporting but I was just pointing out the differences between sources when it comes to unfounded rumors like Xavi to NYRB.,SportingKC,cer295y,1,t5_2secp

567984,0,t3_20kxsm,Im a little nervous about this game.  Feilhaber has been the best player in the midfield by far and hes hustled his ass off for three straight matches now being absolutely everywhere.  Im thinking that they rested Zusi against FCD knowing that Benny would be out for CA in Mexico but Zusi has historically looked rough after long layoffs.  Hopefully he keeps it together in the midfield if Feilhaber is out.Probably see Peterson Bieler and Sapong up top with Zusi Nagamura and Uri in the middle and the usual suspects minus Sinovic in the back based on the lineups weve seen so far and the need to hold them in check.,SportingKC,cg4u2oa,2,t5_2secp

8130949,0,t3_4qltrh,I think it would take at least  seasons of missing the playoffs before they would consider cutting Vermes loose. If we miss them this year I would guess that they would make some major changes on the pitch if it happened again they might look to change coaching staff. ,SportingKC,d4tzpop,2,t5_2secp
8167127,0,t3_4r4x47,Doms yellow today means hes out next week against NYCFC.  This makes me really glad that we kept Rubio.  So what will Vermes do without a striker on the bench? Bring up someone from SPR?,SportingKC,d4yfv4x,3,t5_2secp

8499398,0,t1_d63udou,So whats the deal with their underachieving great players this year? We can play the what if injuries happen game if youd like but my point was this season is far from over.,SportingKC,d63z5t5,1,t5_2secp
8890794,0,t3_5211r2,I know most ppl on this sub disagree with me but Ive never stopped thinking that defense is the biggest problem for this club this season.  All year theyve been ridiculously easy to beat with simple shit regardless of whos in the lineup or what style theyve played.Yeah theyve been pretty abysmal finishing this year but games like this prove that whether or not they score has little bearing.  Theyll give up soft shit and blow leads to bad teams.They need better defenders.,SportingKC,d7gjpsl,14,t5_2secp
9175990,0,t3_55wapn,Yes Sporting KC is playing but it isnt a league game its a CONCACAF Champions League game a tournament involving teams from all of CONCACAF. KC qualified from winning the US Open Cup last year. The team they are playing Central FC is from Trinidad and won a tournament of Caribbean teams to qualify. Unfortunately KC has already been eliminated and this group game is meaningless. So while itll be an SKC game Id be surprised if there is a single SKC starter playing.,SportingKC,d8f4h6w,3,t5_2secp

10407786,0,t3_5otn1l,Its a little presumptuous that Besler is captain right? He lost it to Espinoza and never got it back. FTR I think hell be captain this season but for accuracys sake probably shouldnt be listed as such. Edit typo,SportingKC,dcnsgnl,1,t5_2secp

10924711,0,t1_de6hqu7,Wait what? gtNemeth at least came in with the tag of a goal scorer who never lived up to potential.gtBlessings ability to replicate his scoring in MLS is yet to be seen.Im having a hard time reconciling these statements. Nemeth came in as someone who could potentially score goals even though he had struggled to in the past  so thats a positive. But Blessing comes in as someone who has been a goal scorer and it doesnt mean anything until it happens again? ,SportingKC,de6t393,1,t5_2secp

11181002,0,t3_5zjwwi,I have mixed feelings about the first two games.Our build up play is magnificent compared to last season. While theres still some lobbing are passing is very sharp and very much with purpose.What worries me however is not that we havent scored. Its why we havent scored. It doesnt feel like we addressed the problem of finding a forward who is comfortable running at the goal and taking  shot. The opposing teams strategy can still be shut down dom and it will work every time. Gerso and Medranda may get better as they become more comfortable but right now if those rumors about Nemo wanting to come back are true management need to swallow their pride and jump on it. ,SportingKC,dezcr6t,3,t5_2secp
11227267,0,t3_6081oo,I watched it on sling last game and the game before.  It was on one of the five fox sports Midwest channels.  I belive it was on alternative channel .,SportingKC,df4lgx5,2,t5_2secp
11417429,0,t1_dfpv4qf,You said  gtYeah he scores  goals every season but hes a striker that plays over  matches every year his goal numbers should be higher to be considered a consistent striker.I stated several statistical facts that suggest that is incorrect and invited you to back your statement up and you couldnt. You also said  gtThe fact that his first touch is shit and has zero ability to create something for himself is irritating.   I didnt comment on that because i agree.  But hes still one of the most consistent strikers in the league and thats a cold hard fact.  Im pretty sure i didnt miss anything. My point however was to try to hopefully prove to you one of our many local gifthorsemouthlookers regarding Dwyer in KC that we are a very fortunate club to have Dwyer.  A lot of people seem to forget how many years SKC toiled in CF obscurity before Dwyers ascension.  You have to go all the way back to   and Josh Wolff to get a striker with more than  decent season and he fell off after that.   gave us Eddie Johnsons one good year but almost half his goals occurred in two games.  Then  more seasons of a revolving striker door until Dwyers breakout as a starter in .  We should appreciate him as a fanbase.,SportingKC,dfq5jto,3,t5_2secp
11536424,0,t3_64lsb8,Really think in the midfield Medranda deserved a spot over espinoza. Espinoza had a good game like the rest of the team and that one great assist but Medranda seemed way more involved. He was involved twice on the build up to Doms goal and won possession to get the attack going a few different times. He was very dangerous last night. Plus playing on after that knee to the head lol I was very impressed with his perseverance.,SportingKC,dg3nmew,2,t5_2secp
