24838,0,t1_ceh8p3n,This has nothing to do with the P  NP problems.Simulating an Nbody system can be done mathematically for  bodies and for certain cases of  bodies figure  and o  I think. I.e. you can give it a starting configuration at t and the configuration at t s t minutes or t years can be calculated easily in constant O time and given these bodies have a radius of zero and all the usual physics jazz .But if you have an more complex Nbody system i.e. most  and any   etc systems you have to solve it iteratively which means you can not jump forward in time arbitrarily. Every position has to be calculated based on the one before it worst case On  but even Onlogn is nasty here.So you know t meaning mass and velocity of your objects. Then you have to decide how precise your steps are going to be.  second . seconds . seconds?None of these step sizes are close enough to reality which is why even space agencies can only say with certain probabilities where an asteroid is going to be after a year or longer that and solar output.Then KSP does this nice projection of your path while you are firing your engine or fiddling with a maneuver node that too would have to be done for every pixel. All the while a lot of spacecraft are in their various orbits and have to be simulated as well.And then you want to time acceleration while you travel for months to reach Jool while still retaining enough precision so that one of your fueling stations doesnt crash due to a precision error?All those problems are not present with the patched conics approach at the cost of only ever being influence by one object at a time.Still fake Lagrange points would be really neat to have.,KerbalSpaceProgram,ceh9e28,47,t5_2smr1

117170,0,t1_cerr94o,Youre showing a comparison between the two engines given the same amount of fuel which is somewhat useful.For an applestoapples comparison in terms of performance as an upper stage its better to compare two engine types with different amounts of fuel such that the total masses are equal. You should take away . tons of fuel and tanks from the LVN or give . tons of fuel and tanks to the LV to compensate for the difference in engine mass and get an equivalentmass stage.Youre also not considering payload or TWR here. Ive got a whole set of charts here  that take all that into account long story short is the LVN is great at low TWR high vacuum deltaV and high payload. For other combinations a smaller engine usually the S gives lower total craft mass though possibly much higher part count for the same payload TWR and deltaV.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cerruzg,10,t5_2smr1

160975,0,t1_cewqn5l,Difficult may not be the right word?  Tedious I guess.  Thanks for the information on a better way to find updates that will help.  Im sure B has good reasons for doing it the way they do but its still implementation details to the end user.You are right that it should solve more problems than it causes.  Mod managers can enhance a users experience beyond just managing mods though.  Minecraft has some amazing mod packs for example  A collection of related mods can provide users with a unique play experience.  Id like to see a mod manager with an ability to handle lists of mods and can roll a copy of ksp with those mods installed.For the bug report tool it would be something that generates a blob of diagnostic text that could be uploaded manually somewhere or put on pastebin.  So if a user reported a problem and was using this hypothetical mod manager you could just ask for a diagnostic report and then prove that it was installed incorrectly an old version or that config files were changed manually. So the way that linux packaged managers tend to work is the original app developer just releases a source tarball and the distribution maintainers or sometimes the developer will maintain set of build scripts for the application to build against the other apps and libraries that are shipped with the distro.  The compiled code is packaged into a strictly specified format eg rpm that includes dependency information checksums and install paths for each file.  The package also can include post install scripts that are executed by the package manager after the files are unpacked.  These packages are then put into a repository eg yum  that the clients can poll for updated versions.  If a user updates an application it will walk the dependency tree for each package updating those applications from the repository as needed.  If anywhere in the dependency tree there is an unsatisfiable dependency or conflict an error is thrown before any update happens.  If the user has modified a file that comes with the package eg a config file and the new version has a different base file the user is warned and has the option to use the new version.  The user has to intentionally circumvent the package manger in order to put things in a state not intended by the distro maintainers. The way I suspect this would work with KSP is that the mod manager functions like the distro sans compiling.  It would keep meta information about each mod checksums installation quirks download locations etc.  If a user tries to update KSP to a new version and is using mods that are not listed compatible they should be forced to uninstall the mod cancel the update or at least manually modify the meta data to force installation.   Users running old versions of KSP will not be prompted to update mods to versions that have not been tested with on the new version.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cewrnut,2,t5_2smr1

173250,0,t3_1w2h7x,Im almost done a Kerballed mission to Duna and back.   Heres what I didSent up the main ship with  nuclear engines in three nacelles around the central fuel tank.   Put a lander on a docking port on the front of each nacelle each lander should be as symmetrical as possible or youll have trouble keeping your direction during acceleration.  The landers have two sets of chutes one for Duna and on for Kerbin on the return.  Once you detach one or more landers move the remaining ones to the center line docking ports to maintain symmetry.  Put extra fuel tanks on the front and back of the ship with more docking ports pumped and dropped one after achieving escape velocity from Kerbin and one after braking for Duna capture.  This will free them up for landers if you need to move them.Perform lander operations.   Recover landers.  Put them on the engine nacelles if you still have three otherwise move them to center line ports if you only have one or two.  Pump all the lander tanks dry.Perform escape from Duna and capture by Kerbin.  Refuel landers and  deorbit to Kerbin.  Collect science. Good luck.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cey5zdm,2,t5_2smr1

187118,0,t3_1w8e7m,I have a few questions and commentsFirstly what speed are your planes managing to achieve running on atmosphere? Most of my successful space plane designs reach about ms before they switch over to lox remember every ms you gain on intake air is speed you dont have to achieve using less efficient rocket engines.Secondly how bigheavy are your planes? Remember just like with rockets every tonne of weight costs you in deltav. With space planes this is even more vital they tend to carry very little fuel relative to rockets so efficiency is everything. With that in mind build small Im talking a mk cockpit SAS a mk  fuselage jet fuel and an flt fuel tank with a rapier engine on the back. Slap on a single set of wings canards and a stabiliser. Liberally apply air intakes and see how it flys. With the single rapier you can run it right to the limit on intake air and let it switch to lox automatically without fear of flat spin.I am not seeing anything drastically wrong with your flight plan I know mine are likely less than perfect one other question though is how much spare jet fuel do you have when you switch over to rocket power? Again every unit of unused jet fuel is weight that has to be carried into orbit.Do you have any screen caps or craft files of your designs? It might be useful for pointing out design issues. I will try and post some successful designs myself tomorrow.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cezr2g8,1,t5_2smr1

197697,0,t1_cf0xdil,Theres a trick i sometimes do so that i can plan out a small maneuver now that only comes to fruition many many orbits later. Place a maneuver node where you want to do your burn periapsis is a good spot. Dont drag any of the handles just create the node. At this point you should see indicators of how close an approach youll get  orbit in the future. Next place a maneuver node behind the first one. Again dont actually do anything with the node just place it. The indicators should now show what will happen in  orbits. Now place a third just behind the nd then a th behind the rd and so on. With each extra node you add the closest approach indicator moves one orbit into the future.Do this until you can see far enough into the future that you get close to an encounter with kerbin. Now find your first maneuver node and adjust it using the prograde and retrograde handles as you adjust it youll see all of the other nodes moving sliding around the orbit. Since youre doing your maneuver so far in advance the effect of any burn is compounded and you should be able to get an encounter using only a little bit of fuel. You shouldnt need to mess with any of the nodes other than the first one they exist just so you can peer into the future.Once thats set up do the burn it tells you to do and then time warp however many orbits it takes. When youre in the last orbit or two you might want to tweak things so that youll get the right altitude for aerobraking. Remember that when crossing into kerbins sphere of influence you want to be a low time warp so that the predicted altitude will be accurate if youre at high warp you may find that your actual altitude doesnt match the predicted one,KerbalSpaceProgram,cf0ykhn,3,t5_2smr1

206058,0,t1_cf1kayg,If you have Kerbal Engineer you can do something along the lines of putting all  satellites on a single carrier craft then putting that that on an orbit with an orbital period  times your desired orbits period You can work out orbital period without Engineer its twice the difference between your time to apo and time to per. Its just a bit easier with the modThen you release the first satellite at periaps and get it to burn retrograde into the desired orbit. Let your carrier complete an orbit and the first satellite will have completed a complete orbit and another quarter orbit so itll be a quarter orbit ahead when you release the next one. Keep releasing a satellite at periaps and burning them into their orbit and eventually theyll all be a quarter orbit apart.Alternatively for a slighty rougher but easier approach put one in orbit then target that from the next one. Use the closest approach marker to sort of rendezvous with the position a quarter orbit apart from the previous satellite. Once all are in place tweak their orbits to match their periods to ensure they wont slip out of position. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cf1wwez,1,t5_2smr1

Cargo planes just wouldnt have enough pizazz for a gun this bad as soon.  Well have to hire some engineers to build an aircraft accessory for the gun.  Get on it. Only gun to induce a dangerous amount of roll when fired.  Only gun to stall an aircraft when fired in long bursts.   Im off to YouTube to watch this thing blow stuff up.

278491,0,t1_cf9mc2b,Yeah. Itll be about  hours before I can post them but Ill just post them here. Ill tell you now its a slow boat and I use a few mods Kerbal Joint Reinforcement and I think most of the irreplacably different parts are from KW Rocketry and RLA StockalikeKW for BIG orange tanks for the initial launcher and RLA for .m tanks for probes. I will tell you before I post I really fucked up my probes by not putting RCS on any of them except the one I was planning on leaving at Laythe but is going to end up being what returns to Kerbin. That was dumb and gave me some serious issues but there was a good bit of delta v left on the lifter that I could have done it again. Ill probably be doing more focused missions when I return to Jool. RLA is great for probes and the like and also comes with a couple sweet smallsized Rockomax engines and a baby nuke. EDIT All in all theres plenty Id do differently if I did it again but it could give you some good ideas to work with. Itll probably net me somewhere in the range of  science which isnt a whole lot when youre trying to wrap up the final tier of the tech tree. EDIT  If I were better at docking I wouldnt have tried it in one launch but except for some shitty design decisions I dont think it went too horribly and my main toandback vessel has about k delta v with two nukes.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cf9mmgt,1,t5_2smr1

282780,0,t1_cf9prf5,i have been thinking about this quite a lot. its a grand idea but ive never quite solved certain issues combat. once there was an extremely interesting discussion in raskscience about possible realistic forms of combat in space and the general concensus was it would be rather boring as far as games go. you cant hide in space so most of the combat would necessarily play out over huge distances the fights would be drawn out with sudden fatal results mostly relying on complex computer systems and hacking of those. trading. again very lengthy. in ksp your travels between the planets are still relatively few and far between. this is what makes them fun. if you were to trade successfully between many stations and planents the means of transportation would probably have to become routine. this would reduce the space flight to basically setting up a maneuver and hitting execute kind of like mechjeb but easier. multiplayer speeding up time in an mmo  how would that work? maybe you could substitute it with some sort of warpjumps but that wouldnt solve the other lengthy maneuvers when in orbit.this is not to sound too negative just problems to tackle. i guess youd have to sacrifice some of the realistic aspects to make it happen in the end.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cfa2ocv,3,t5_2smr1

However if they show up in sandbox but not it career you can do two things. First make sure that you have the proper tech unlocked and two go to your KSP directory and open the FASA launch tower mod and find one of the parts.

448476,0,t1_cfqow3j,I did model rocketry a lifetime ago way back in them there early s yknow so I come from a background where clusters  cool. Mind you a lot of that comes from the fact that clustered model rocket engines tend to be unreliable its tough to get them all to ignite at the same moment so a large part of the cool factor is the satisfaction of actually getting it to work. Not an issue in KSP but it carries over!I did some draft work of what the final assembled ship will look like The lander has the strapon tanks intended for Laythe landing amp first stage ascent. The lander itself will handle roundtrips at Vall Bob amp Pol unassisted and should handle the ascent from Tylo. A Tylo descent stage is not pictured.The forward ship weighs about  tons now for a total Kerbin departure mass of  tons. The outer tanks give the complex  ms dV enough for the trip to Jool and back plus  ms to maneuver around the Jool system... and thats without touching the center tank which refuesl the lander or gives up to  ms reserve fuel for the ship  ms if I arrange the engines so I can dump the outer tanks when empty. Theres room for a lot of weight creep here I should still be able to do it if the forward ship gets up to  tons.Your Duna ship looks way better than my Duna Transfer Vessel Von Kerman which was propelled by a cluster of four tanks with a single Poodlemax on the center one. Yeah thats right I went to Duna all chemical with the lamest possible engine. Also I thought I could use RCS to balance out the wobble on the CMLander joint. I was sadly mistaken and brought around  tons of monoprop I didnt need.I think the best ship I ever put together was for an Eeloo mission When I launch my Jool mission in .

You need one of them on each that points back at Kerbin but then other dishes to point at places like Mun and Minmus.  And when you start heading out into the rest of the Kerbol system youll need the really long range dishes to point at the other worlds too.When setting up the initial network though youll want to point the Kerbin comm sats Mun dishes at the Mun comm sat thats heading toward Mun or Minmus or any other body first.  Once the Mun Comm sat is in orbit around Mun or wherever then you change your Kerbin orbiting comms sats to just point at Mun.  This way you have constant contact with your outgoing comm sat enroute and then once the first one arrives it can act as the local link for the following probessats.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cg2m5pz,1,t5_2smr1

614790,0,t1_cga4p6l,gt Tricouplers were there so that i could connect those big fuel tanks nicely  how could i have done it better?I just checked and the rocket fits fine without these tricouplers the ones between the bottom stages big fuel tanks and the next stages LVTs.  I personally would just remove them.gt LV  I just unlocked Atomic engine  should i replace this stage with them?Maybe.  Probably.  The LVN atomic engines are easily the most efficient liquid fueled engines in the game the ion thrusters are even more efficient.  Youll sacrifice some acceleration though.  In my test flight I wound up using the LVs do burn for the lunar intercept while still in atmosphere not on purpose... the timing just worked out that way.  The craft will almost certainly have more Delta V with LVNs but the lower thrust to weight ratio may mean that you cant do as efficient of burns making use of the Oberth Effect for exampleburning close to the planet to get the most energy change out of a given delta V.gt Yes separatrons were for takeoff from Mun. If not these  what are the best way to get of from Mun? Sometimes I manage to get of just fine with a bit of fuel sometimes i dont make home with more fuel...If you reduce the size of your lander then this shouldnt be a problem.  Remember for takeoff from the Mun you want to get to where youre burning horizontally at  degrees as soon as possible for an efficient ascent.  Cut engine power as soon as your apoapsis is at the height you want then burn again at apoapsis to reach a stable munar orbit.  I would shoot for something below  km for this orbit.gt How to save Goo results etc in the pod?On the Kerbals portrait click EVA. The Kerbal will get out and you can move him around using WASD.  If you get off a ladder you can activate the jetpack with R and you can go up and down with Shift and Ctrl.  Walkfly to the Mystery Goo or Science Jr or other science device and right click it there will be a button.  Return to the capsule and the science will be stored inside or you can right click and hit the store science button.  Be warned though that if you pull two of the same pieces of science e.g. two Mystery Goo readings from the Muns surface then you cant put them both in the pod and you cant return the science to the Goo containeryoull have to dump one.gt Extra question  i managed to get this craft to Dunas SOI but couldnt land  what are the best way to get in the nice orbit of another planet? now im guessing orbits until it shows that it will hit.For a planet like Duna that has an atmosphere I would suggest tweaking your trajectory when approaching to minimize your periapsis.  RCS is especially nice for this turn it on with R then use IK JL and HN to translate.  The altitude you want to come in at varies from planet to planetfor Jool you want to be above  km but for Duna you can be under  km.  Take a pass through the atmosphere and burn off enough excess speed to let your craft be captured in the SOI.  Same for landingjust take a lower pass.  Be careful in Duna thoughthere isnt enough of an atmosphere to cushion a particularly direct descentyou want to take a long pass through the atmosphere slowly bleeding off velocity until you get down to the surface where youll probably still have to use engines to slow down and land.For planets without an atmosphere you should do the same general process but instead of losing speed from the atmosphere you should just do a retrograde burn at periapsis.gt And extra question about engines  when to use powerful ones when not so much? And does Specific Impact measure efficiency? When to use atomic engine?You should use powerful engines during takeoffs and landings.  Ideally you should be shooting for a TWR of around  for launches in atmosphere and a little higher for launches in vacuum.  It can be nice to have a TWR of  or so for landings.  For other cases you should use engines with a high Specific Impulse which measures efficiency.  In real life it measures average effective exhaust velocity divided by g .ms  for reasons I still dont understand.  A real engine will have the same fuel flow at all ambient pressures and will produce more thrust at lower pressures but in KSP engines will produce the same thrust at all pressures but will use less fuel at low pressure.The equation that you should get familiar withespecially if you plan to work out the math yourselfis the Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation  Delta V  Isp  g  lnmm where m is the initial wet mass m is the final dry mass Isp is the specific impulse and g is . ms .  This shows that to get the most delta V out of a rocket you should try to maximize the specific impulse and the fuel fraction percent of the initial weight that is fuel.  Generally that will make the Nuclear engine your best bet but that engine is heavy so for small craft it is actually better to use a smaller lighter engine.  Theres also the Ion thrusters which have a specific impulse of  but they take hours to move craft of any significant size.It is often preferred for gameplay reasons to use several nuclear engines for a crafthour long burns arent very interestingbut a single LVN will always have more delta V than several Isp is combined as a weighted average so two  s Isp engines is still an Isp of  s.  Meanwhile the additional engine increases final mass and causes total delta V to go down.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cga5io7,2,t5_2smr1

Set up your burn so that you exit Minmus orbit retrograde to its path around Kerbin.  Doing it this way will result in a periapsis much closer to Kerbin.  If you burn long enough you really only have to burn as you exit Minmus orbit to end up landing at Kerbin.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cgb9e9w,1,t5_2smr1

715094,0,t1_cglg3vi,Id say the best way to get the science home is in the capsule that you return you Kerbal in. The capsules are a lot tougher than the instruments and less likely to get destroyed during landings. If you want a set of repeats you need two capsules. Only transmit reports and things you can easily get more off or if you cannot get the science back to Kerbin. Otherwise transmitting things isnt really worth it.But yeah science in KSP is really very counter intuitive. Ill try! and explain.Once you do some science the science is like a physical thing like a ball. They bud off instruments when you do experiment. Each instrument can only hold one bud at a time.Like bees attending flowers Kerbals can pick these balls of sciencey nectar up and move them about take data on the right click menu. Once you remove a bit of science from a instrument it frees up the instrument though goo and materials bays need cleaning. Then it is just a matter of getting these collected bits of science nectar and making sure they get back to the hive... er... Kerbin.The standard way is to just put them in a capsule. But capsules cannot hold two copies of the same science item. So two Gravity Scans over Minimuns Highlands would not fit in one capsule. This is probably for game balance reasons but it appears that in practice is just ends up confusing people more.A science Lab or a Kerbal however can hold any amount of science ever identical copies of the same item. If a Kerbal tries to deposit a bunch of science objects in a capsule only those that fit go in the rest stay in his pockets. But if you have two capsules you can bring home duplicates by trying to deposit everything in the first capsule dont get in! and then depositing everything thats left over in the second capsule. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cglk5tg,5,t5_2smr1

747657,0,t1_cgokxpa,The biggest thing to think about when you are doing a maneuver to get home is you are trying to kill momentum relative to Kerbin. Even though you arent moving compared to minmus you are moving at several hundred meters per second relative To kerbins velocity. What you are trying to do is kill that velocity. Burning retrograde to minmus orbit. That will in turn slow your Kerbin orbit. Am I making any sense? You could burn at degrees inclination but as long as you are burning retrograde it will kill some velocity relative to Kerbin. What I do is I fly using the map when Im ascending from a planet. Watch which direction your ascent is heading and if its not retrograde relative to Kerbin fix the direction. Does that make sense?

810204,0,t1_cgw0z52,Jet engines are a bit broken with regard to fuel efficiency. The devs made a mistake when setting the ISP. Jets usually have effective ISP quoted which is the ISP itd have if you pretend youre not using air. Net result is they use about  as much fuel as they should.It doesnt matter overly when you are using them for a space plane though. The amount of fuel you use for the air breathing stage wouldnt matter much anyway and you have to switch to rockets at km anyway because of the intake air requirement. The turbojet is a little OP in terms of how much thrust it produces at high speed really youd have a lot of trouble doing over mach  ms in a turbojet. Hybrid turboramjets like the SR has are good for about mach  although the airframe of the blackbird isntNet result is that turbine powered single stage space planes have a small niche low orbital operations whereas in real life theyre not viable. Throw away first stage turbine boosters are also useful but the thought of how much that would actually cost if cost mattered means I dont usually do it.The RAPIER on the other hand is hilariously OP but that makes some sense as the sabre real world in development engine wouldwill be very very good ifwhen it works.

Youre going to have to build a ship with enough fuel and a few empty seats and then youre going to have to perform rendezvous in Kerbol orbit.You wont be able to do that unless you can build a ship that can get lots of fuel to orbit. This should be your first task figure out a way to reliably get to orbit with a lot of fuel. Look up tutorials on getting to orbit.Then you will have to learn rendezvous. Look up tutorials on this. You should practice in low Kerbin orbit until you can do it reliably without much trouble.Then you are going to have to practice Hohmann transfers. You should start with Minmus or Mun and then be able to get to Duna without trouble. Again tutorials.Scott Manleys Youtube channel should be a good resource for all this.After you do that you should have all the knowledge necessary to rescue your stranded crew.

1031383,0,t1_chlioid,well we can see a lot of them which helps but we can also gather data much better in real life than we can in KSP. for example  we can simply point some orbital telescope or ground based observatory lenses at the asteroid belt to find new object but in KSP we have to wait for the game to spoon feed up new ones and they disappear after they exit kerbins SOI. the reason we cant really give an answer is because there is no reasonable way to get one. the game will continue adding new asteroids to the mix and the list in the tracking station will grow ever larger so there is no way to know for sure. in real life we could literally just track down every single asteroid gather what they are made of and use their size to estimate their mass then do this for every other asteroid in the belt and get a definitive answer which we could update when we find that some of the objects have crashed into the sun or performed a lithobraking maneuver on mars.TLDR the game is making it so we cant know.,KerbalSpaceProgram,chliuq7,1,t5_2smr1

1108791,0,t3_26teta,Lift by itself is pretty much irrelevant. What you need to look at is the liftweight ratio. On rockets thats expressed as thrustweight ratio or TWR. Here you need to make sure your wings are generating enough lift to counteract the gravity pulling you down.Secondly lift is directly related to speed and the angle of velocity relative to the plane of the lift surface. Thus the faster you go the more lift you get out of a certain wing.So to fix your problem you need to do one of three things. Add more lift surface.. Remove weight.. Go faster.Theres other stuff you can do to make takeoff easier like lower the rear landing gear or trim the wing surfaces up slightly. If youre just having trouble tipping the nose up try moving the rear wheels closer to the center of gravity while still having them behind it.Also make sure your center of lift is slight above and slightly behind the center of mass.Theres a great article in the sidebar about building planessstos and heres another  now that the forums are back up.Good luck!,KerbalSpaceProgram,chubslj,5,t5_2smr1

1146084,0,t3_278zmt,The best way to do it is to use a resource such as this to plan your encounter straight out of the metaphorical gate represented by your burn to exit kerbins soi. It takes some practice to get it right every time but it will save you a TON of time and allimportant deltav. Plus this is how real life works.To do a transfer you should first wait until the planets are at the proper planetary phase angle. Then set up a maneuver node at the proper position on your orbit for the ejection angle. Set the destination as your target and manipulate the maneuver node as needed in order to get the game to indicate a location of you and your target a closest approach. Continue to manipulate the node until the two arrows are close together for an inclined target it is important to remember that the acending and decending nodes are the points at which your orbits cross so you should burn normal or antinormal the purple triangles in order to match one of them up with the encounter. Manipulating the node until you get an encounter is really the part that takes practice and the best way to learn is experience or possibly a video. Here is a good one from Scott Manley Once you have an encounter or at least a really close approach flying to the planet is as simple as making small course corrections through maneuver nodes of course in order to refine your approach. Try to get as close as possible to planets with no atmosphere just be wary of terrain and position yourself for an aerabrake in planets with an atmosphere. The right heights for these can be easily found from google. Good luck!Edit Fixed the first link,KerbalSpaceProgram,chyjp35,1,t5_2smr1
1146404,0,t1_chykou0,The asteroid claw that came with the last patch. It will grab things. Do some testing on Kerbin its pretty neat.I just was realizing you landed on Tylo not Duna. Tylo is one of the super hard planets. You will need a crane with enough fuel to get down  dV? and  dV minimum to get back up with the lander in tow.A challenging plan indeed. I think a more practical approach would be to build a lander for there. Take it to Tylo and land near your ship. If there is a pilot there then have him grab the science off your lander and hop on the new one. If it is a probe lander then send a manned lander loot the science and scoot.This Friday I should be ready to post my craft files for this flight. They include a two man Tylo lander.

Land at target is almost always wrong because it doesnt assume any gliding and even if youre in flight and lined up the spaceplane guidance will sometimes ditch your plane into the side of the hill short of the island runway. Trying manually and quickloading when you fail is usually just as good.Jet VTOLs are also pretty bad. Translatrons vertical velocity hold works great for responsive engines like rockets but the step response of jets is slow enough to result in badly underdamped behavior throttle and vertical velocity tend to swing back and forth underover target.RCS Build Aid revolutionized docking for me but mechjeb can still do it faster in most instances.

1210559,0,t1_cebiml8,That actually seems like it would be less of a huge problem and more of an opportunity for some gameplay mechanics involving station keeping settings. Maybe instead of deorbiting it just calculates how much fuel is required to fix the orbit and debits it.... then let you set a fuel alarm theshhold ala KAC Time warp Stopped Satellite has reached low fuel thresholdadd maybe a way to fast forward and set a node in a future orbit where the orbit has deviated more than some set amount.That said I am not one of the people who cares so much about this. Low energy transfers and the interplanetary transfer network would be fun to play with as would HALO orbits and the like.... but really..... you have to draw the line somewhere between where we are and.... having a game so complete that it contains kerbals who dont leave their house because they play so many hours of Earthling space program. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,ci5t18o,1,t5_2smr1

1248955,0,t1_cia3dtc,I only burned up a tiny bit and almost immediately went sideways burning up just enough to avoid hitting the surface. Got my speed up enough to get a kmish apo and circularized from there. It has plenty of dV for that but sadly I used up more than I planned on the way down so I had to finish circularizing with my RCS which I had apparently took way too much of. BTW it had  FLT drop tanks two with additional aerospikes to help with the decent and the extra aerospikes were supposed to help with the ascent as well but I had to drop them on the way down cause those tanks ran out of fuel. The Mk lander seen in the Vall and later landings had much less RCS and has about .kms of dV as opposed to about .kms for the Mk lander that landed on Moho Tylo and Laythe plus a much higher TWR due to its two aerospikes. The Mk can easily land on and return from Laythe what it was designed for cause it had to save the Mk which couldnt return from laythe due to a lack of TWR until I stripped the ship of its chutes and science after landing.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cia4fru,1,t5_2smr1

1253710,0,t1_cian6qv,The SR did use some evasive manoeuvring if necessary. It was often required anyway since they would have pass their target area before the missile had a chance to catch up with them. As demonstrated in Scott Manleys video the wings of an aeroplane creates a lot more force then an engine can. It does not take much for an aeroplane to outmanoeuvre a missile at mach .. Even if the aeroplane have stubby wings and can only get an angle of attack of  degrees.As for the SR flying near the edge of space it depends on your definition of space. It flew at ft or km. There is not a lot of atmosphere up there compared to down here but far from a vacuum. Missiles and even the MIG could also reach the speed and altitude of the SR.

1294690,0,t1_cif8gak,I didnt say dont install any parts at all. There are definitely some sections of the base game that are simply extremely frugal or outright missing especially when it comes to the SPH but spaceplanes are probably not a good place for beginners to start and people are absolutely free to add whatever parts they want. This was simply a caution not to go too crazy on s of additional parts when starting out because it will quickly become overwhelming especially when it comes to the parts of the game that are relatively well serviced in stock parts youll quickly end up flooded with superfluous and often completely unbalanced parts that can be detrimental to actually picking up the basics of building a functioning rocket.The kind of mods I was listing was stuff that is basically fluff fairings cameras cool stuff basically and information that benefits both experienced and beginner players alike.When to add more parts if you even want to is a case of YMMV. Many people will pick stuff up and be hungry for more parts right away and thats cool. My point was simply that there are plenty of mods that are great for new players to go for right away that isnt going to drastically change the game besides making it pretty cool or a smoother experience.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cif9pfd,1,t5_2smr1

Twelve different situations in one mission and you dont even have to land anywhere except Kerbin of course if youre planning to return home.gt Do you physically have to bring those items back with you when returning home?You have three options to get your science home. Keep data and land your vessel somewhere at Kerbin with the science module attached then Recover vessel Send by radio. You have to have an antenna and a bit or a ton it depends on experiment of electricity in your vessel. Most of experiments have a cap of science that can be sent by radio it may be  or even  or  of full capacity. I usually use radio for crew reports and EVA reports only because theyre not radiocapped. If you mission is manned you can EVA your kerbonaut and tell him to get data from a science module. The data will be stored at the command pod when your kerbonaut gets back into it.

She starts out with lots of curiosity and interest in catching bugs and modeling the solar system and as she gets a little older people start saying things like dont get your shoes wet or youre going to get your dress dirty as shes trying to catch specimens in a tidepool.

You can attach them in the front. The total plane balance actually benefits from that. You can however rearrange the wings to get it  correctly. The landing is pretty tricky since you need to zero the vertical velocity just above the runway and than straighten the plane horizontally for touch down. That however looks damn cool  PS.

1493281,0,t3_2b7e7g,Im sorry but youve got a bit too much hubris in this one. Youre talking about having Squad add an entirely separate resource to every part on a EVERY ship and then having to keep track of all that without the luxury of something like a relational database but rather just a text file with a tree structure inside of it...all to facilitate only mods at this current time.On top of that you assume it was oversight instead of something they did to continue down their development path and possibly even for early game performance. In this case if they left it out initially for whatever reason if they still dont have an actual reason to add it in yeton their own end where they are already strapped for time and manpower to satisfy the frothymouthed impatient class of more and more KSPers these daysthen why should we all feel obligated to tell them that it is imperative that they fix this? So someone can feel special for being clever and finding what theyve convinced themselves is a bug?TLDR The games in alpha and youre modding it. We appreciate your efforts in increasing the game experience but dont think that means well blindly beg for your little custom feature they may not want in their game to begin with.Edit Im a software engineer by trade but Ive never so much as tried a hello world basic type KSP mod so maybe Im oversimplifying but each part on each ship in the persistent.sfs seems to have a UID Unique ID. Could you not use that number as a reference in a save file of your own to relate each part to its current value? That surely wouldnt look any different to the players as you seem concerned about.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cj3ghhi,1,t5_2smr1
1493577,0,t1_cj3cwvj,So true. I consider it a UIsave bug. I understand that you can load a specific Kerbal in a ship save it and when you come back and load it that Kerbal might not be available.

It had to be insanely fast so it went from m to m in  seconds at Gs. The Kerbal Space Program version uses StretchySRB . meter diameter . meter length parts to power its way through. Unlike the real missile it has a structural failure at a bit over m but the target would be hit at that point.

1792554,0,t1_ck4p5jj,There are a few things that can cause this phase angle burn dv exact burn direction etc.  It can be quite fiddly.  Have you set Duna as your target?  That helps a lot because it marks your closest approach and where the target is at that point and gives you an indication as to which way to adjust.  Fine adjustments can be done by hovering over a node handle and scrolling the mousewheel.  And you can drag your node around your Kerbin orbit left click and hold the centre circle to slightly change your ejection angle which can make a big difference.  Also Duna has a slight inclination which can make getting an encounter a bit more difficult.If you still cant get it post a few screenshots one top down showing your ejection angle one top down zoomed out showing phase angle and target position at closest approach and one sideways showing inclination with ascending or descending node highlighted.,KerbalSpaceProgram,ck53oat,2,t5_2smr1

I havent flown it to Eve yet though. Doing that soon. Ive been doing lots of unmanned testing and practicing e.g. aerobraking the return vehicle into orbit and returning it and using infinite fuel to deliver the lander to Eve for practicing flying it. Ive never actually tested this lander though because the one I flew to Eve had jet engines which I didnt realize didnt work on Eve!

It should actually be uniquely capable of handling memory leaks since it should be able to allocate more memory without crashing due to running out of memory memory leaks should affect the bit builds a lot more and they really dont.

2074868,0,t1_cl3jzfr,lol. Someones getting mad. Im not unhappy with the product and i never said im entitled to anything. They just didnt look like all the other parts in terms of quality. Ive put thousands of hours into it. More than a lot of people probably more than you. Ive done multiple grand tours and have landed on all planets and returned. I bought the game at version .. I can say if the game is bad on some fronts. Before i heard about the settings.cfg bug with the textures i thought the dev team either royally fucked up some how with the textures accidentally changing the resolution or they released unfinished parts. There is nothing wrong with criticizing how a game looks feels and plays. Thats how games get better.  It doesnt matter that it is early access technically. That doesnt provide them immunity to someone saying it is bad buggy or terrible looking. Nothing ive said is being taken seriously and i know that. i didnt hear about the settings.cfg bug until udkmdlb told me about and i thank him for it. Im not even bitching about it being incomplete.  Im bitching because the textures were awful compared to other parts they have added in the past. If all textures looked like this then i would be fine with it. But they went from great looking textures to terrible textures on new parts which didnt make scene to me at all. I still cant believe you think that just because i dont like one thing about the game then i must hate the whole game. tldr The textures didnt look as good as previous updates which added new parts. That got me worried and confused. Read the rest.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cl3k7hq,1,t5_2smr1

Otherwise advanced features of the game like stations larger interplanetary ships and anything else too big for one launch wont be possible for you.Every hundred hours and every playthrough I do makes my previous one look like I just started the game its a continual improvement. This sub also helps every now and then a post pops up which uses parts and mods in ways never before seen. I suggest making a folder to save cool design pictures then muse on them for your own ships At  hours I still didnt know half the keyboard shortcut. At  hours I learned about mods and installed a few. At  hours I was making Remote Tech comms networks around the Kerbin moons and simple interplanetary ships based on Manley designs. At ish hours I was making Interstellar mod ships for extreme range ships. I look back on some of those designs and I think some are horrid.

Same thing with getting close to another ship. yeah I cant spell rondevous . Orbit lower until the target is getting close to tangent right in front of you create a manuever node of the prograde burn to meet the target. Notice the markers are pretty close now drag that node around your orbit till they are really close.Once you are close to your target make sure you are in target mode click on the speedometer it will say orbit surface or target.

2128439,0,t1_clac2cy,OK Ive screenshotted a few of my more reliable planes.

Make sure that they are attached using fuel lines so it uses the main bodies fuel as well.Finally you should place the the landing gear just behind the COM and in front of the elevators. If you imagine a lever the gear being the fulcrum the elevator being on on side and the COM being the other.You have to use the elevator to push the rear downwards in turn bringing the nose up and then flying away.,KerbalSpaceProgram,claddnb,2,t5_2smr1

Also Im at work and thus have only had the chance to scan this post so sorry if Im doubling up on anyone. Just wanna get this out of my head.Something Id like to see added to science is long term experiments. Youd have a specific module for it and that module would need to be connected to a science lab. Simply by being active it would deliver say  science per week. After x weeks of being active no power outages always attended by a Kerbal and hasnt run out of resources this ties it in to the resources they want to add you can upgrade it assuming youve unlocked enough tech tree by adding a new resource or component to it. This would give you a reason to have a fully functioning station powered and attended with regular resupply missions. Instead of holding it for an upgrade you can return it to kerbin to receive science equal to a percentage of the total science it has generated for you the weekly scienceIll have to flesh this out a bit but I think it has potential,KerbalSpaceProgram,clc43ps,1,t5_2smr1

It doesnt follow the scientific method and encourages players to only investigate an area once leaving much science beyond practical worth. We can do better.

Here are percentages of the total science one biome has per experiment. I have other ideas for experiments that I hope Squad take onboard.

Forcing OpenGL drastically reduces RAM usage at a slight performance cost which will vary depending on your machine but without reducing texture quality.  ActiveTextureManagement is tweakable but the basic version will compress textures reducing memory usage at a slight cost to performance and somewhat more significant cost to texture clarity.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cm21z1u,3,t5_2smr1

2376450,0,t1_cm51ne0,Howdy  hours logged player here!The idea behind orbit is deceptively complicated for such a simple idea Get something moving so fast and so high up that it is moving faster than it can fall down.The reason things like rockets go in the up direction first before moving sideways is just because of this stupid atmosphere which while nice for breathing is a literal drag when it comes to moving things at a fast speed.  And we want to go fast because were trying to move faster than gravity can pull us down into the dirt!So first we go up because theres less breathystuff the higher you go ask a mountain climber.  Then once were starting to get up higher than most of the tallest mountains we start kicking over sideways.  You might think SIDEWAYS but what about gravity!  Well we still have lots of boostjuice and were still going upward at a pretty good rate so well be okay.While were still in the upwardgoing phase we find ourselves out of the breathysphere but we still want to go faster so we dont fall back down.  So at the top of our upwardgoing phase we boost sideways some more and thats just enough to get it so that we dont get slowed down by breathystuff while moving faster than gravity can catch us!Badabing badabang badaboom youre now moving in a circle with the planet below you!Getting from your new perch above it all to other interesting places involves orbital mechanics from now on and explaining those is... well complicated.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cm5frxk,8,t5_2smr1

2388080,0,t1_cm6vh98,ampampamp Orbital decay sfw gtIn orbital mechanics decay is a process that leads to gradual decrease of the distance between two orbiting bodies at their closest approach the periapsis over many orbital periods. These orbiting bodies can be a planet and its satellite a star and any object orbiting it or components of any binary system The orbital decay can be caused by a multitude of mechanical gravitational and electromagnetic effects. For bodies in a low Earth orbit the most significant effect is the atmospheric drag.gtInteresting General relativity | Orbit | Low Earth orbit | Mir Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmvhbv oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmvhbv.

2512405,0,t1_cmmfot2,I think you might be thinking of real world astronautics because yes that can happen reason being that you are always influenced by every body all the time so the equations and what actually happen become more complicated.However in KSP it is stricly a one body model. I actually calculated it out to see what would happen in your scenario and you are correct you would be captured... But you would litterally fall straight to the ground haha. If you have any excess velocity you will just fly away or hit the ground depending on the directionIn your EDIT scenario this is what would happen. We are assuming perfect world stuff... I mean like this problem is done on paper kind of stuff So I now that I am on my computer I can show you this equation    E  v  mewRwhere mew is the Gravitational Parameter of whatever you are orbitingR is the radius from you to the bodyE is the Specific Orbital Energy  wikipedia article on this v is your magnitude of your velocity relative to the body or your orbital speedI can go into great detail in describing this but think of E as like how much Kinetic and Potential energy a craft has. You use this equation to determine the escape velocity of a body. If E is less than  then your orbit will always be influenced by the body. If E of your craft is greater than  then you are in a hyperbolic escape trajectory. And finally the most important is if you E is equal to  you are in a Parabolic orbit which means if you could when R approaches infinity eventually you will stop moving in theoryThe reason the last one is important is this. In you scenario we would subract the Bodys velocity vector and the ships velocity vector and we would get zero since they are both parallel and equal in magnitude and pointed in the same direction Now lets plug that into the E equation R in this case is the SOI distance    E    mewMun as an exampleR    E  .Wo! Look at that you are captured! This actually will happen! HOWEVER you have to be PERFECTLY alligned and the difference between your velocity and the Bodys velocity has to be PERFECT... Or are you? Because KSP works with SOIs that have limits your Capture Energy is not Below Zero. It is Less than the E at the SOI with zero velocity so our Equation changes to     E  v  mewR  ESOIand ESOI is equal to the E that we just calculated. Thus when we plug in Zero for velocity and SOI for R for Mun the mewR and ESOI term cancel out and we get    E    v ... v  Using this logic if we have ANY excess velocity the v term would be greater than zero and thus E would be greater than zero... Which means you will escape the Bodies influence.Now lets say you had any excess velocity. Any. We have two cases then your excess velocity is pointed between prograde and retrograde away from the body your excess velcocity is pointed between prograde and retrograde towards the bodyIf  then in the next time step your altitude will be incremented no matter how small just a hair larger than the SOI and you will not be captured according to the gameif  depending on how big your excess speed and direction its pointing you will either enter a Hyperbolic Orbit or a Ballistic Trajectory.This is the end of the explanation and I actually learned so much from this because I never thought about this before. Thank you for asking! I actually had fun explaining this!Let me know if you have any other questions I know this is a lot to take in... If you want my credentials I have a degree in Aerospace Engineering and aced my Astronautics class haha,KerbalSpaceProgram,cmmid48,1,t5_2smr1

What do each of these buildings do?But now in the . update we have Gene telling you that you can right click or hover over buildings and see what they do.I agree that the texture quality was low but I loved the barn idea.

What are players who want to get that extra bit of cash they need for a mission to launch going to do short of something that takes up all the time they had wanted to spend doing something else? If you decided to spend  minutes why? to farm it that doesnt make it an exploit nor does it mean that everyone will then do the same thing you did... Or that everyone will be negatively affected by it or that the option needs to be removed by the developer for everyone to keep you from exploiting it.So many complaints and issues with . are calling things like this or the offset tools exploits or cheats and not just stopping and asking if these are moves to make KSP more accessible to a wider base of players that maybe isnt as hardcore about every single aspect being as true to reality as possible.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cmxyvj8,1,t5_2smr1

2605362,0,t1_cmynkpa,I think youve got your wires crossed a bit inbetween explaining why full throttle at ascent is best and when the Oberth effect has its best use.Youre right in saying that full throttle is best when taking off from a nonatmoscpheric body but this is not caused by the Oberth effect. It simply has to do with how much time you spend fighting gravity. The slower you go the longer you have to fight gravity thus the more effort you have to expend waste fuel.  Think of it like a ship thats hovering in the air but climbing at an inch per second. Compared to a regular ascent is that hovering ship going to expend more fuel or less? Its a very extreme example but that is the basic idea. More time spent in suborbital trajectory  more fuel spent fighting gravity.Unrelated to ascents however the Oberth effect is a very good thing to remember if youre in orbit and want to get the best fuel efficiency possible mainly when going interplanetary or on a very dV expensive voyage.But as far as Im aware there is no correlation between the Oberth effect and how engines react while ascending towards orbital speeds.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cmynphs,2,t5_2smr1

2622485,0,t1_cn0twgm,Honestly i understand your complaints.And the modding community has put out some fairly good skins for pretty much everything in the game. Hell sometimes I use some modded rockets just because they look better.And yeah I dont understand why Squad just doesnt take those guys and suck them into the company and say BAM now the game looks  more attractive. But integrating those things takes time and money. Time and money that they are spending on actual gameplay changes that are for the most partPretty fantastic.I just paid  bucks for the steam version of FSX. Dovetail the team that bought the rights to launch that game on steam is going to do nothing but monetize the content the modding community has already created. This game is like... Super old. I dont expect them to add any real value to it other than introduce it to the steam multiplayer community. And they are going to make a fuckton of money doing so.I dont see how anyone can shit on Squad for their community oriented approach that has concentrated almost entirely on improving gameplay. They are the model approach for prerelease games and to be honest the only example of a company doing it properly.So you can see why I replied to your comment.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cn0wa1c,5,t5_2smr1

2781130,0,t3_2rxej4,. COPY your saves folder to another location ie. make a backup of your saved games just in case. CUT the GameData folder and PASTE it in another location dont delete it. In Steam right click on the title of the game and click Properties. Under the Local Files tab click the button that says Verify Integrity of Game CacheWhat this does The GameData folder is where all your mods are installed but the folder also contains other important files. Removing the folder will remove all the mods but it will also remove some KSP files. Clicking the Verify... button in Steam downloads only the missing KSP files. Note Any crafts that you have that require missing mods will not load.  Note If this for some reason causes issues just delete the new GameData folder that has been downloaded and replace it with the old one that you cut and pasted. Same thing with the saves folder. This will restore the game to the way it was before you started messing with it. If all else fails just uninstall the game delete the whole KSP folder and redownload the whole thing. Then copy your backed up saves folder to the new KSP folder after it installs. If everything works out and youre completely comfortable doing so you can delete the old GameData folder that you cut and pasted away if youre sure that youll never need it again.

2812991,0,t3_2sasgo,MKSOKS is exactly what you want I think. It doesnt come with any sort of builtin life support system so you will need a mod for that as you suspected.Im not particularly familiar with MKSOKS but I think it has better compatibility with TAC Life Support rather than Interstellar. TACLS is more complicated requiring food water oxygen and electricity rather just life support and electricity so its more of a challenge. But I think there are MKSOKS parts or addons designed to compliment it. Look more into that.Define shitty laptop... I play on an Acer with a  year old core i and integrated graphics. I have the game on lowish settings Active Texture Management to save RAM and an assortment of mods including EVEAstronomer. But I can only use the last revision of Astronomer Edge of Oblivion Intersellar is too much for the game to load on lowish settings. Im at something like  memory usage during the game and my fps is usually lower than most people would be willing to accept. Alas I got addicted to the clouds and beautiful planets. All of this to say you might be able to make it work... but check your expectations at the door.It sounds like youre after a challenge particularly with respect to money and mission planning. You need Kerbal Construction Time. I think the UI is a bit awkward but I cant play without it. It essentially puts gametime limits on how fast you can build ships and do research. After designing a ship or researching a node you have to wait for it to actually be completed. Might not sound like much but give it a try. I was surprised by how much fun I had with it.Also take a glance at Kerbanomics.If you just want information and no autopiloting type stuff I prefer Kerbal Engineer Redux over MechJeb.Not sure if FARNEAR RealChutes and Deadly Reentry are in the scope of what you want but I love them. Theyre not as scary as they may seem but theyre definitely a game changer. Especially FARNEAR.edit forgot to say laptop uses integrated graphics.

2862647,0,t1_cntgrg7,Well there are other cooling effects. In this case the rapid expansion of gas into vacuum would result in cooling. Try getting a can of compressed air and spraying it. Observe how fast it gets cold. Also basically how refrigerators work. Additionally evaporative cooling would be significant for a person but meaningless for a spark. When a liquid evaporates the surface it left from is cooled this is how sweat works. In space the boiling point of water is much lower so you would feel some additional cooling from the rapid boil and evaporation of water in and on your skin make sure you close your eyes. All in all however these factors would be relatively minor and suffocation would be the cause of your death. Im not an expert and I dont know all of the equations you would need but the gas expansion and evaporation should reach equilibrium within a few seconds maybe a minute or two and reduce your core body temperature very little. The majority of your heat loss would occur via radiative losses and take on the order of a few days to weeks. Its not a fast process and over heating is a legitimate concern in space.I know NASA has a report on human body response to vacuum. I think it was written about a scene in .

That should be the deltaV required to reach that altitude. Add in the required speed to get deltaV...This does not regard either air or gravity drag so no this wont work. Also i have tried calculating with energy before and its just really complicated for rockets.I havent tried calculating this before and thus havent checked if its accurate but id try to simplify it more. Here are my thoughts on the matterProblem for stock is in the beginning you have huge atmospheric losses then you have most of the gravity losses. For me this kinda calls for splitting it into two parts.So for lower altitudes you could assume constant speed should be a precise enough approximation. It has been a while i played stock what TWR do you need to keep your speed . or something like that? With constant speed you get a time you have to sustain this time times acceleration then gets you the dv your rocket needs to have.For higher altitudes like for a suborbital flight you could approximate the flight after  km with negligible air drag or am i underestimating stock atmosphere here? If so increase value. With high TWR which you already have for the atmosphere with at least  at that point you could just assume an instantaneous burn it also doesnt take that much dv to get suborbital so the burn will be short even with not that high of a TWR. And of course add a safety margin for all the simplifications.gt Or do I have to figure out the time to h and multiply that time by . to get the additional deltaV to reach h?For the real earth this would be accurate enough but for Kerbin the gravitational force gets smaller much more quickly so you cant assume g is constant. Only for a very rough upper estimate this would work for low altitudes or with a positive spin youd add a bit of a safety margin ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cnv909s,2,t5_2smr1

It is not an error to situate a force in there as it isnt as well to situate it on CoM that are where they should be located. If this is misleading to people then again problem about the concept rather than accuracy.I know Squad tries to simplify the game in last instance. Crap the game must be fun for it to be a game.

But you probably dont want to assemble and especially fuel a rocket in an expensive lab in a populated area so you want to do that in an old building out in the middle of nowhere.Also note that lower deltaV requirements make building a rocket to orbit much more feasible for nongovernment institutions than on Earth.Funding for a permanent VAB would probably come after the operations turns from an experiment to a space program.Edit Consider that a V rocket on Kerban would be more than big enough to crash into the Mun and those things were produced hurriedly and in wartime conditions. No wait Im retracting that. I misread the units on the data I found. Okay the V actually only had ms of deltaV. If you removed the warhead that goes up to ms and if you made it burn RP then ms.

A slower burn would be even less efficient as a result.There are tricks and tactics beyond this for things like for ion engines and satellites in the real world multiple extremely short burns at the periapsis of an orbit instead of one large burn for example.

2938342,0,t1_co21wk7,gt but you cant let it deceive you into believing something that is obviously not true when you look at the bigger picture.What obviously false fact do you think Ive been deceived into believing?  I think I made it clear that I dont think tidallocking and synchronous orbits are the same phenomenon.All Im saying is that they have certain characteristics in common.  For instance just as a geostationary satellite will stay fixed above a certain longitude on the equator the Earth stays fixed above a certain longitude on the Moon ignoring libration.  You cant really argue with that can you?Basically I think theres two major problems with pretending stationary orbits and tidallocking are two sides of the same phenomenon.  It implies the tidallylocked body is the parent body e.g. the Moon is tidallylocked to the Earth therefore the Earth is in a stationary orbit around the Moon.  This is problematic because if only one body is locked its generally the smaller body.  But just as its wrong to pretend the Earth orbits around the Moon its also wrong to say that the Moon orbits around the Earth.  True the latter is less wrong but both statements are fundamentally wrong..  Tidallocking implies the system is the result of tidal friction while stationary orbit makes no assumption about the underlying mechanism.  But uSalanmander actually admitted that this was a shortcoming of making the comparison.  For whatever reason you misinterpreted this admission but its there in their comment.Please dont assume people dont know whats going on.  Im fully aware of what tidallocking is what stationary orbits are and the differences and similarities between the two.  I honestly think that if you hadnt misinterpreted the second part of uSalanmanderss comment and if they had worded things a little better you couldnt find anything to complain about.,KerbalSpaceProgram,co23p8g,1,t5_2smr1

2962188,0,t1_co4rc1q,Check out this guy namedropping his Retina iMac. No but for real its not about render quality or the resolution at which you play the game. Its about the fact that Squad has written a terrible terrible computer program. At startup it digs through the game folder and loads every texture it can find whether its used or not and keeps them all in memory forever or at least it tries to. If you ask it to load too much it will eventually fail to allocate additional RAM the operating system will refuse to when the game asks and the game will crash. Whats illustrated in this screen shot is one interesting way in which that happens.On my MacBook Pro I can play at x resolution with x antialiasing and the highest render quality all day long  though I dont because the frame rate isnt awesome but unless I run Active Texture Management under strictest orders to compress all textures down to little more than impressionistic blurs my game cant load all the textures for my preferred and admittedly excessive slate of mods and it crashes ludicrously frequently.,KerbalSpaceProgram,co4tdav,0,t5_2smr1

2985522,0,t1_co7fewm,So every bit of hardware in your machine has a piece of software called a driver. In linux specifically with video cards there are open source drivers developed by the community and there are closed source proprietary drivers developed by the GPU manufacturer. These are critical for video cards as they control all the visuals and are directly responsible for getting the best out of the card. The open source drivers usually do an okay job but for any gaming you really want to use the proprietary drivers. I dont have any direct experience with elementary but I think its mostly the same as ubuntu so this should help.  Depending on who manufactured the GPU in your MBP this will have varying effects If its an Nvidia GPU you will have the best experience best FPS least glitches  if its an AMD GPU it will be okay but probably not as great as on OSX  and it should also be okay if its an Intel GPU but I dont have any first hand linux experience there either.,KerbalSpaceProgram,co7g34b,1,t5_2smr1

3000458,0,t1_co8wzjb,My faith in Squad isnt the issue.  The issue is more how people will judge the game on release.I think those ratings are in part due to the fact that people perceive problems with alpha games differently than they do released games in that they are more forgiving.Hence I think those ratings will fall because sadly there are far too many fundamental issues with the game for it to be released.  At least too many and too substantial to be fixed without an adequate and iterative public beta period  something Squad have chosen to eschew.I would always wish them the best of luck but alas I consider it a bit of inevitability.,KerbalSpaceProgram,co8zui2,8,t5_2smr1

Objects that are placed into an orbit it appears to be any orbit around Kerbin the Mun even the Sun will randomly decide to show up orbiting the black hole. This happens after I leave the shipsatellite that is in orbit and start another mission. Even debris from missions will show up in an orbit around the black hole. This is a HUGE problem because I cannot launch a ship set it on a course for another planet and set an alarm via Kerbal Alarm Clock because when I return to it it will be orbiting the black hole.

OPM and TransKeptunian are pretty good packs but most everything else is really really rough in my opinion.  Unfortunately this happens when something becomes too easy to use to get ok results.

3164684,0,t1_copyy35,gt To me the poll represents a bigger issue. As you said this game is ultimately up the dev. We should be able to voice ourselves but if we want to digest our views for them it has to be useful data.Yeah this is true.  I just think the stock interplanetary transfer experience feels a little awkward.  I dont have strong feelings on how it should be improved but I do think something should change.For instance I am one of those people that like to learn the math and calculate the phase angles for myself.  But then Im stuck holding a protractor against the screen since theres no ingame way to get angles.  And then I feel silly.  People that want to use outofgame tools e.g.  for calculating phase and ejection angles run into the same problem.For others that just want to play without getting bogged down in details getting a transfer by trialanderror is pretty awkward.  If your first guess at a phase angle is bad you have to warp forward then reconfigure the maneuver node.  Or you warped too far and now you have to wait another minute or two for everything to line up again...Im not saying this is a huge problem or that this should be a priority for ..  But I think theres some room for improvement.gt Also is a doppelbach a musically talented doppelganger?Ehhh its just a lame pun on doppelbock and J.S. Bach.,KerbalSpaceProgram,coq0o5r,2,t5_2smr1

These two mods are created by farrem and are the best improvements for aerodynamics you will find.  Once you get used to stock you will have to dramatically change designs and ascent paths in order to play with one of the mods.If you decide to play with one of the aerospace improvement mods you should get a fairing mod aswell.  I liked Procedural Fairings.  Not sure if it is still the best one because I went back to stock aerodynamics last year.As for visual enhancements go with Astronomers Oblivion Pack.

3362927,0,t1_cpap6oi,I dont feel like they really answered your question... The astronauts CAN grab the ISS and throw it away. If one of them goes outside and pushes it then they will cause the ISS to move.But when you give some momentum to a very massive object the ISS the change in velocity is very small. By pushing the astronaut receives the same amount of momentum in the opposite direction. And because they have relatively little mass their change in velocity is very large. The applied force puts the same amount of momentum in both the ISS and the astronaut.If you put an adult and a child in an ice rink with skates on and the child pushes the adult both of them will be moved by the force. The child just move away much faster because he is less massive.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cpblkef,1,t5_2smr1

3425249,0,t1_cpibjg4,Now thats how its supposed to be done. Now Ive never made a video game although I am a programmer and have experience in that field. If you tackle bugs as they show up or shortly after someone informs you about a bugs its generally not that bad fixing  bugs. Now on the opposite side of things if you keep on adding new features without fixing bugs in the already existing features youll almost always add at least one new bug to the already decent size stack of bugs that need to be fixed. If the stack of bugs start to become overwhelming it tends to break any moral you had with the project because lets face it no one likes focusing on fixing things for days and days possibly even weeks or in the absolute worse case months and not working on new and fun new features.In short working on a small amount of bugs as they show up isnt that bad because hey its  bugs. Nothing major at all. But if you start adding new features with reckless abandon you start to get an overwhelming amount of bugs that youll possibly end up spending weeks fixing them and no one enjoys that. I made that mistake once never again will I do that. The process of fixing bug after bug after bug just killed any fun and desire to work on the project for quite a while.EditOne more thing that I feel should be mentioned the consumers using this thing youre working on will be much happier if the bug thats been annoying them for the past week gets fixed promptly. Why add new features that will more than likely introduce even more bugs that will likely annoy the consumers just as the last bug did. Theres no since  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cpipc41,4,t5_2smr1

Further inspection showed that there is absolutely  load on the nvidia chip when run on the laptop display and  load the moment I plug into a monitor.So theres a chance your dedicated gpu isnt doing shit if youre on the laptop display.Makes me regret buying the laptop as it was  more than the comparable desktop I could have built but I was a student so cest la vie I suppose,KerbalSpaceProgram,cpmmrik,7,t5_2smr1

3491678,0,t1_cpq8nck,Each plugin should be contained inside File then loaded in sequence set beforehand.     Conflict resolution. No hard overwrite is ever needed because all conflicts are resolved with mod loading order.     Encapsulation. Mod contained within itself is safe from harm     Dependencies.    Basically its the same thing as CKAN does now  plus more. Conflicts could be resolved not only by error flag but by merging  too.    Also dependencies could be resolved within Engine itself  eg. Module Manager as a Master file then all plugins using MM would have MM as required master.    I think it would be most beneficial in highly derivated mods. Take Interstellar. Dependencies resolved through Master files plugins like KSPi addingremoving parts then KSPiE to tweak finally independent plugin with KSPi as master adding parts     All with clean structure allowing to safely addremovetweak modsupjf can I ask you to comment too?

3494553,0,t1_cpqklkq,gt Ive never expressed an intention to break anything. Ive only suggested changing a base mod loader to support safer method of mod loading. Yet it was you who suggested that if ANY of changes were to be supported it would be harmful to community.And yet you agreed that those changes would happen.You suggested a mod loader that was more restrictive.  It has to be to make it safer.  You agreed that Squad would not support both loaders which would lead to one being chosen over the other which one would that be?  You have agreed that the more restrictive loader wouldnt support all mods kill off mods in the process.  I dont see why killing off mods doesnt count as breaking things or is not harmful.  Or do they not count if you can say that mod installation has been dumbed down sufficiently.gt I might be going offtopic here but Ive never imagined that you could be so overprotective of your own rights as a modder that even a mere thought of other way may push you into realms of speculation.I dont have to speculate youve agreed with me the whole way that for the sake of new users the projects that I and others have worked on should be destroyed.  Youre arguing that people who make stuff for others for free should have that taken away because there are some users that expect things to work without thought.  You have agreed with me on this the whole way that thats youre goal they just expect it to work and all right?  So you have to restrict us.  And yes I am protective of the capability of something that Ive worked on for  years people who advocate for things that will destroy what Ive worked on annoy me in general but this seems particularly egregious.gt I wont be hiding it you made me angry because you seemingly care only about what is in your playground.Has it occurred to you that without me several of these particular playgrounds would not exist for me or my users to make use of and that your scheme risks them being destroyed?gt Ive never modded KSP more than part editing yet I know the problems that current system has I know how it was improved I can see what problems and possibilities MM opened how CKAN fixed things.Youre working in part configs but you understand the issues what issues? with plugins?

I dont mind constructive criticism nor disagreeing. But I will not allow you to attack me because you know better. And what about criticism that attacks your basic premises?

The key in this ones design is being basically encased in wings so it still has pretty good lift when flying on its side. Theres a vid of it on that page showing what it can do.SSTO  the KnatExecutive built as a part of a set of mini SSTOs it has enough to make orbit and do some manoeuvring once there. Its main point is its pretty quick and very easy to fly.SSTMLAB single stage to Mun landing and back SSTOlunarVTOL the KnatRangerXL part of the same mini SSTO fleet but this one is a devil to fly but if flown right it can make it to Mun land and take off there VTOL style and return without refuelling.  This one is an odd design its single rocket engine is mounted facing down for VTOL landing on Mun but that makes its ascent from Kerbin kinda interesting! vid on that page. Large SSTO unimaginatively called the SSTO transporterno craft file but lots of pics built as a cargo lifter and could take about  tons to LKO. That was built a few versions back . I think. Despite its size it was actually pretty easy to fly it had  TurboJet engines  LVs and  aerospikes and a very wide wingspan. Ran quite a few missions with it bring parts up for stations its main draw back was it was slow to reach orbit.If youre interested I did a whole career using nothing but aircraft first couple might be a bit debatable if youd call them planes.

3661993,0,t3_32ajd5,First be careful with the altitude tutorial missions theres a bunch of starter money there Launch k m .k m k m k m k m k Escape atmosphere k Orbit kThat gets you to over k before even doing a single random generated mission and gets you a bunch of science enough to get jet engines if you take the Outsourced RampD at the Admin building.  It also gets you enough reputation to get all the local kerbin missions surveys EVAs various sci instrument reports and just enough to get satellite missions which you can just barely do at this point.  If you do a satellite mission then Looking back mine cost  and made  though it was flown very efficiently onto a horrible orbit itd be fairly easy to do with a k launch even with the basic unupgraded buildings.  Doing that unlocked station missions for me which I needed upgrades to do but could barely afford with my advance on the station job and that put me in the realm of lategame contracts after  missions not really all that much harder but pay well so you can upgrade the buildings.  Station missions this early are inadvisable though unless youve got a mod to add a lowlevel docking port like the prototype attachotron from station science for example.To recap Dont go higher than required for the altitude missions as you need to come down and get paid for the next one otherwise you potentially half your tutorialstarting money which makes things much harder. You dont get paid to be the first to break km up when you already did it on the test where you got paid to reach km. This means use the liquid engine and parachute right from the start  burn the liquid engine slightly to kill some descent just before touchdown on landing as the single starter parachute wont be quite enough to soften the landing engines are expensive to blow up or use struts as legs inadvisable if you can do the other kind of landing due to drag and weight added by them. If you cant affordget the satellite missions do kerbin atmospheric missions in a plane which launches vertically no wheels unlocked yet probably and a parachute using struts as landing legs.  When you get an engineer who can repack chutes add a second cockpit for them to come along.  This means prioritizing the jet engine in tech satellite missions are costlier but need only very low tech with the exception of the solar panel  your next priority after the jet.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cq9oxl0,1,t5_2smr1

3662540,0,t1_cq9q7vz,I think it is a valid simplification from a gameplay point of view. If you want lifting bodies go ahead and use FAR. I personally love aerdynamics.

3664224,0,t1_cq9ph1h,Theres a grain of truth to this but its not usefulness being strained its FARs assumptions being strained which makes it more prone to errors.  All models require assumptions but due to how complicated and expensive aerodynamics can become aero models tend to require some bold assumptions to make them work assumptions about the type of shape or what does what etc..  Stocks going to likely include some kinds of assumptions like that as well and I expect that the minmaxers in the community will find any slight violations of those rather fast.So what Ive been doing is shifting away from the current partbased approach to a full vesselfocused approach instead.  Ive already got WIP test builds that some of the other modders and some realismfocused players have had access to to mess with and havent heard of any really horrible bugs.  The end result is that payload fairings and cargo bays wont require special treatment anymore youll be able to build interstages fairings and bays out of pretty much anything if you want and lots more finer detail on parts will affect the vehicles.

3831632,0,t1_cqslf5u,You can access individual part temp by enabling it in the debug menu altf under physics gt thermo. It at least gives you a workaround until they fix it or a mod does.I agree that the new heat implementation isnt ideal or even good. What is the point if it ends up being essentially arbitrary? Oh there goes that very important part because it overheated. Guess I have to restart the mission because there was absolutely no way to know it was going to happen save from lots of personal experience dealing with things sort of randomly blowing up and abstracting heat values from that.It is a terrible design decision to implement it this way and horribly unfriendly to new players. It is like adding a random failure variable that you have no control over as there arent any parts to counteract it except good craft design which is not an option early in the game....Heat is now very important but we have no way to see it except cheating. It should be very visible with part warnings inflight and explicitly readable in the rightclick menu for any part like it is with the cheat turned on.And on the topic of mining and nuke engines they either need to turn the heat way down or add at the very least specialized radiator parts. Having to deal with it by increasing part count x isnt fun it is just stupid and bad design. Im sorry but the implementation is just bad. If you want to force people to mine slower it should just mine slower not have this heating problem that requires a bunch of workarounds. At  capacity yes I could see having an overheating issue but overheating at  or much lower without the many solar panels doesnt make a shred of sense. Make whatever value doesnt overheat  and make higher values accessible but susceptible to overheating.Likewise why would the Kerbals be able to make superOP jet engines that rip themselves to pieces and destroy the plane body but never overheat and not make a mining refinement rig that overheats if running at even  of its max designed capacity?

By the time you get to the end of that line the mun will have moved so you will continue along on the purple line.  It is actually just one straight line just the orange one is moving with the mun.  The purple line shows you will be on an escape trajectory from kerbin this is not ideal.  Instead burning from mun orbit directly at kerbin what you want to do is burn in the opposite direction that the mun is traveling in this case to the left.  That will kill some of your speed relative to kerbin and you should more easily be able to fall back to it.

The second is a weird derpy thing that KSP players have called a gravity turn for a while since it worked in older versions of KSP. But thats not a gravity turn. You shouldnt ever point more than a few degrees off of prograde. You wouldnt do that in real life and you shouldnt do it in KSP now. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cqwqzgc,6,t5_2smr1

3878195,0,t3_34v2mp,It most certainly is possible it can sometimes be an issue getting the ship where it needs to be though. I would recommend going to Minmus with a mining ship as its got a fairly low delta V cost to get back into orbit making it somewhat viable for mining. Heres an example of a ship that Im using for it  It contains all the useful science stuff  drills and enough room to hold  ore and refine it.It only has between  delta V depending on RCS amount or even as low as  when fully loaded with orefuel  yet it can get into orbit and into a very high orbit around kerbin which is enough to satisfy most contracts. I would recommend a LOT more delta V if youre planning on using it at Mun or another planet though. I have seen some people have success with pure mining ships that dock with refineries in orbit so that may be the way to go  I havent had any experience with it though.TLDR It depends on the place youre doing the mining. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cqycj6m,2,t5_2smr1

3882034,0,t3_34vss8,The surface scanner works in tandem with the orbital scanner to give you a more detailed look at the ore immediately around your craft.

To use the surface scanner just right click on the part and it will give you the body you are on the biome your latitude and longitude and the percentage of ore around your craft. For this to work however you must have preformed an orbital survey first. The last option of the scanner Run Analysis will update your ore map an overlay in the map view with accurate numbers for the area you scanned.

In stock this is still a humungous amount of deltav. They then could add a selectable option unlocked by having an Engineer on your craft to refill EVA jetpacks using the ships monoprop supply.

Tutorials wont ever spoil that. Nothing ever spoils the fun of building silly things then being delighted when somehow one of them works.The other way to play is to take space travel seriously and try to travel to other worlds for the joy of exploration. Every new thing you learn helps you go further out into the universe. KSP deals with some quite abstract concepts so theres a difference between reading how to do something and actually doing it.

Oberth effect really only comes into play for transfer burns its more efficient to burn at periapsisapoapsis if you want to raise or lower the other.  You can think of the transfer burn as raising your apoapsis to where you want to go so thats why you burn at your periapsis.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cr2vy2x,1,t5_2smr1

3918250,0,t1_cr2w7re,Youve got the right idea.  Set the Kerbal as your target and launch when they are approaching the KSC.  Match your orbit to theirs.  In map view an indicator will show your closest approach.  If they are behind you raise your orbit so you slow down and they can catch up.  If they are in front of you lower your orbit so you go faster and catch up.  Use the maneuver nodes to plan these they will also tell you your closest approach.  Get your closest approach under km then waitwarp until you are close to the other ship.  Use the navball to line up the pink target marker with your retrograde marker this means you are heading towards the target.  Watch your velocity so you dont approach the target too fast or too slow.  Hope that helps.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cr2x01k,3,t5_2smr1

For me when I set out wondering to myself What do I do..  I saw the microwave relay system and thought Thats perfect! Gonna beam me some power everywhere! And thats what Ive been doing these past three versions up til now which is fun! The reactors are heavy which feel challenging to build a ship around but the new fairings help. Long term orbits require multistage ships but the microwave relays provide persistent power which means with a dish on board future launches make batteries a thing of the past. Or with the cylindrical microwave receiver directly mounted to a thermal engine it becomes an airintake fuelfree engine. With my current network of about Gw incoming power as spread over  reactors radially km pointed towards  relays antiradially  km I can get a free firststage lift off with such an infrastructure. albeit the receiver on Jool only receives Mw of power Cheating? Nay. SciencE! P.S. The guy who made the game said something along the lines of he had always envisioned making a game around the idea hed had as a little kid of shooting his little green guys to the moon. I take that to mean you should have some kinda dream for your little guys like that too and just run with it. Me?

If this is behind the center of mass that means that too much up force will pull the planes nose downwards which then reduces the angle of attack and effective lift.If the center of lift if ahead of the center of mass the opposite happens lift forces the planes nose upwards.

3961222,0,t1_cr7rgah,Youll want the escape path to be such that you leave the Muns sphere of influence traveling tangent to the Muns orbit. If youre on the side of the Mun that faces Kerbin as it appears you are from your other comments its going to be a largely eastward burn. The nuance is in how high above the horizon to point. If you save and try it a couple times youll see how different escape angles will result in different orbits around Kerbin once you run out of fuel.Personally I usually kick off the surface enough that Im in a suborbital path that will crash back to the surface in  minutes go to map view put a maneuver node near the apoapsis pull the prograde vector out and see where the predicted orbit will end up. Then I tweak the prograderadial vectors till the resulting orbit after SOI transistion puts the AP on the Muns orbit.Since the Mun is traveling around its orbit while youre on your escape trajectory the line youre escaping on will effectively rotate relative to Kerbin so youll have to account for that a bit. Trial and error and seeing how they move will help a lot once you do it a few times paying attention to whats happening pushing here results in more there your spatial reasoning centers will pick up on it and itll become intuitive ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cr7t9q7,2,t5_2smr1

4063957,0,t1_crjf7b4,No. An afterburner injects additional fuel into the exhaust where it burns very inefficiently. The additional thrust in short bursts when necessary is considered a good trade for the massive fuel waste. In a liquid fuel rocket engine one of the largest limiting factors for thrust is how quickly you can dump fuel into the combustion chamber. To get fuel in faster they add a turbine engine that burns fuel to drive a pump to supply fuel to the main engine. In the US designs the exhaust from the pump turbine was vented away. In the Russian designs they recycled the exhaust back in to the main engine. This means that the expanding gasses and any still burning fuel products from the pump drive add to the main thrust. It makes the engine much more efficient but adds a lot of complexity. Edit  Im not a rocket surgeon. Please pardon any inaccuracies. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,crjiqbf,6,t5_2smr1

4115228,0,t1_crp8pm4,Both speed and velocity are relative to a frame of reference.You seem to think that speed is defined as displacementtime instead of distancetime. This is wrong.The speed of an object is the magnitude of its velocity the rate of change of its position it is a scalar quantity. The average speed of an object is the distance path length traveled divided by the time taken the instantaneous speed is the limit of the average speed as the time taken approaches zero.Velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time speed is the magnitude of velocity. Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time taken.So your thought experiment is using average velocity instead of instantaneous velocity but deltaV is referring to a change in instantaneous velocity.,KerbalSpaceProgram,crpd1e2,3,t5_2smr1
4115327,0,t1_crpb0kn,When I was first introduced to it  or  years ago I think it was on a friends computer with a rocket he built. All I knew was that WADS was for controls and the space bar did something.I was a few hours in of trying pretty random combinations of parts and assigning overly complex action groups to try to get the engines to fire in the right order before he explained to me how the staging system works and that I could reorder the parts in that sequence.Even after that it was many many attempts before I actually got into orbit because I was basically burning straight up to millions of meters and then burning straight over no concept of a launch profile at all.So when I finally got to the Mun it was through pure trialanderror no reading of instructions or wikis or watching LPs or anything. Thats just the way I like playing it feels like a more organic learning process and a much more satisfying accomplishment when its something Ive figured out on my own. So yeah it took me like a year to get to the Mun to say nothing of landing on it returning from it etc but thats just the way I play.I imagine there are plenty of people with their own various reasons for being slow as balls to get those kind of achievements.

Then I make a maneuver node whos apoapse just touches the target planets orbit path. Then I have to slide the node around until I get an intercept with the planet. Prograderetrograde must be added to the node as your apoapse will change as you slide around the node. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,crpjcga,2,t5_2smr1

4124021,0,t1_crq9d5i,It comes from the same word awe with the ending ful it originally had the same meaning of awesome but over hundreds of years the meaning drifted. It isnt far off from its original meaning considering awful originally meant having the quality of awe or to inspire awe. Awe as I said was a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder. Over time it seems awful took on the connotation of fear and eventually bad things as we know it in our modern colloquialisms while awesome took on the connotation of wonder in the same respect.You gotta love etymology! You can find some cool trivial facts about English. For example Dunce comes from the name of a great philosopher John Duns Scotus. His teachings were so profound he became known as the Subtle Doctor and it attracted several admirers.

4155769,0,t1_crty6q9,It is again a question of reference frames. If you watch the system from above and see the ball moving in a circle then you see that the ball is constantly changing its direction of movement. Therefor it has to be acted upon by an external force towards the center of the circle. We know that because of Newtons first lawThis inward force is called the centripetal force. The string is providing this force through its structural integrity ... and the fact that one end of the string is fixed. The ball itself wants to go in a straight line because of its inertia. The string forces it to move in a circle.Now lets change the reference frame.If you sit ontop of the ball you are observing the system from a rotating reference frame. That means that the whole reference frame is undergoing an acceleration by the centripetal force. As a result it seems to the observer that every body is acted uppon by a force acting in the opposite direction.Its like when you are in a car or a train that hits the brakes. The braking force pulls the vehicle backwards while you experience a force pulling you forwards out of your seat. Of course there is no forwards force involved. Its just your inertia that makes you want to keep going at the same velocity while the reference frame the car is deccelerating.For the string in the reference frame of the ball it looks like this The ball seems to be not moving at all because our reference frame is centered there. However there is a pseudo force pulling it away  the centrifugal force. To make the ball stay still the string has to exert a force upon the ball that counter acts the cetrifugal force. Newtons third law That would be the centripetal force again.The thing to get here The centripetal force is always there. Depending on the reference frame the centrifugal force can be observed as a force or just inertia beeing changed.To say one view is more correct than the other is not helpful. Because movement is always relative we always need to think about reference frames. As long as we stay in the same frame everything is cool. When we change it things get tricky. In KSP we change references all the time when we change the sphere of influence. Thats why the navball flips. Although I dont know if there is actually centrifugal forces at play when you are in the SoI of a body that is orbiting another body. Hm. I have to think oof a way to try this out. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,crtyxkn,7,t5_2smr1

I sent Jeb by mistake it was supposed to be a scientist on my first attempt at Duna in a lander made it down and back up to orbit without a problem. However being a nb and not a smart man I assumed I didnt have nearly enough dV to get back to Kerbin.So I spent time over the weekend trying to design a rescue rocket in sandbox before trying the rescue in career mode. Finally came up with a fairly cheap design only to burn back to Kerbin in it and realized that I had WAY more fuel than needed by using aerobraking. So much so that I was able to go back out to Minumus then Mun and back to Kerbin in the rescue ship.Went back into career mode got into Jebs stranded ship around Duna planned a maneuver got an encounter improved the intercept for aerobraking midreturn and brought Jeb safely down to Kerbin without needing the rescue ship.Again Im a nb and not very smart. Turns out doesnt take that much dV to get from Duna orbit to Kerbin. Who knew? everyone except me probably,KerbalSpaceProgram,crzzgfx,1,t5_2smr1

I can dig through your post history your username etc and likely dig up tons of public information on you from reddit and elsewhere. Its referred to as doxxing. This site is built on commenting and replying to comments. Theres a difference between mocking someone for a stupid comment and digging up personal information someone posted and mocking them based on that. Or chasing after individuals and repeatedly harassing them ie. the rsewing poster directing your users to harass individuals on other websites imgur. gtIm arguing that instead of using that as a reason for banning just FPH they turned it into a new direction for this site where content thats deemed unsafe will be removed.Ive explained to you a dozen times now why the sub was removed you still dont seem to get it. Its not a new policy and has been around for years.gtTheir actions of banning any new sub that opened up about the same subject on the grounds of ban evasion is laughable not talking about FPH  etc hereThe majority of those subs are getting caught in the spam filter since new ones were being made every few seconds.

Angling above prograde means youre fighting gravity more than you really need to  you want to get a high enough apoapsis with your air breathers so that you have time to build the requisite horizontal velocity to stop fighting gravity. Your orbital insertion should be veeeeeery shallow and spend a good deal of time in high atmosphere. Also use the atomics alongside the Rapiers on orbital insertion.

You have to want to learn stuff that is difficult to master. You have to love to do calculations on a notebook next to your computer or have a spreadsheet open on another screen to figure out deltavees and what have you.Playing KSP is so very different from playing your average console game where you turn the thing on mash a lot of buttons and curse at the screen and blame other players and their mothers when you dont win.Its not a question of whos better. But the people here just want their beloved KSP to stay the way it is and to keep challenging them to invent new exotic and hilarious ways to fail.Every hour that Squad spends on making KSP useable for PS controllers is an hour not spent on improvements to the game itself.

I would really recommend listening to reviewers who have actually worn the headset. The FOV field of view of the headset is INCREDIBLY small. Most reviewers compare the actual Hololens screen size to that of an average  inch smart phone held about a foot in front of your face. Just test it out now. Put your smart phone at eye level about a foot in front of your face. That is the only small square of reality that the Hololens can augment.For the Hololens to actually fill that giant table they showed at E they would need to be standing AT LEAST  feet away from the table itself.Here are a few Article about itIm really disappointed with Microsoft and their marketing department for this device because of just how different the user experience will be from what they have shown.,KerbalSpaceProgram,csccqx1,3,t5_2smr1

Velocity includes the direction of travel. It is a vector. In a circular orbit I will always have a constant speed. My velocity however is constantly beeing changed by the gravitational force of the planet pulling me along in a curved trajectory. It is constantly changing my direction of travel and therefore changing my velocity.Same applies to changing your inclination. If you want to go from a circular equatorial orbit to a circular polar orbit you will need huge amounts of delta v to change your velocity but you will end up with the same speed.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cskech3,1,t5_2smr1

A Story Not like some elaborate story which ties in all of the Easter Eggs and explains the origin of the Kerbals or anything like that. I just want some dialogue boxes or funny cutscenes that mark my progress. Maybe a hall of fame building that displays my accomplishments or some statues that appear on the KSC grounds. I mainly want this for Career mode because right now it just feels like one long effort to turn my game into Sandbox mode. Competition Either in the form of multiplayer or AI. I want to compete with another space program. We have to fight for the same contracts. Do contracts for cheaper or in a faster time or before the other guy and you get a bonus. Earn reputation with each company and maybe they give you discounts on their parts or offer you exclusive contracts. Space race! Contracts that make you cooperate but maybe they reward the greater contributor more. More Resources. The stock info panel looks like it was made for more resources. Well... it was for the sake of mod integration. But it just looks sad and empty without a resource mod. I want more resources. Resources found in oceans and atmospheres. And some variance in where they are found rarity etc. I dont know what they would be used for... the old resource concept was definitely too much. But theres got to be something to do with them. Maybe one that does nothing but gives a lot of money if recovered. Maybe some parts require a resource to build them. Maybe xenon doesnt exist on Kerbin and has to be recovered from elsewhere for use in new ships. Creativity could take things a long way and make resources more interesting. Stock KIS? Im hesitant to say it since KIS does it so well but it might be nice if you could move around and attach parts on the fly without a mod. Gas Giant . Okay I generally roll my eyes when I see this.

4583456,0,t3_3drx3y,That was an entertaining video but Id say that both designs can be made a lot smaller.

It goes to the Moon and back with about  kms deltav weighs only  tons. Here is the whole album The key is to build each stage with an optimal amount of deltav. I believe its about .  ISP. For the first stage that is about  ms which is roughly what I had. The best part is it uses real engines  the space shuttle engines and RD. Coincidentally the capsule was  tons similar to the combined weight of the probe and the tug in the video.However we would be running into evaporation issues especially for a long mission to the outer rims of the solar system.

This had me leaving the system at somewhere around  kms.Granted this might not be possible in the current version.

We had the shuttles separate just after chamber pressure fell below psi you could often hear the CDR say PC  just before srb sep.  At that point they still were burning but not enough for their own mass and in the final seconds you would see bright orange sparks which was the final bit of ablative material burning away that served as the final layer of protection for the aft skirt area.

4867039,0,t3_3hj92i,Getting back to what is probably the source of the confusion the rocket equation if used with ISP rather than directly with exhaust velocity uses a standard earth gravity as a constant.The thing to know is that this isnt because the exhaust velocity is affected by local gravity which would have to be adjusted according to local gravity. Its just the way ISP is defined.The obvious question is why is earths gravity used as a constant regardless of where the craft is?  To answer that we have to go back to the early US space program which was staffed by a mix of german and american scientists.  The germans were used to working in the metric system and the americans were used to using the imperial system.  In order to avoid translation errors they adopted ISP where the ISP was the exhaust velocity divided by earths gravity.  Since earths gravity included the distance measurement this effectively factored out the translation so an ISP of  seconds works out to be the same acceleration under either measurement system.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cu80zzs,2,t5_2smr1

4885663,0,t1_cu9zznq,I went through that entire thread and none of the conventional rocket entries used the k flip maneuver. Even the one you linked uses a gradual turn. Their second image even shows them  degrees off vertical at an altitude of .km. If you mean they were at an angle of  degrees at km as the result of a gradual turn then that would make more sense but very thats different from suddenly flipping to  degrees at km.Also I can explain why its optimal to launch at a  degree angle for something like a trebuchet or arrow.  degrees gives you the best balance of horizontal and vertical velocity to give you optimal downrange distance when ignoring air resistance. I derived it for a high school physics assignment if you want to look at some of the math behind it Note my final step basically says just graph it because I didnt know calculus at the time. Now I dont know if flipping to  degrees at km is efficient or not. I dont have the data to prove of disprove otherwise. I would like to see the source for a lot of modern real life rockets fly at close to  degrees for a significant amount of their ascent though because I could not find any data to support or refute that. My opinion though is that the gradual turn the method you use is best and the old k flip maneuver should never be used.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cuadk9a,1,t5_2smr1

It feels really good to put your knowledge to work and pull of your first mun landing for example. It gives you really rewarding moments both when you managed to do something or even if you just understood something a little better.The demo has changed a lot but its hard to get to the mun because you are missing the more efficient engines. Also the demo can not be modded I believe. I suggest you play the game with the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod which allows you to play the game by numbers to some extent. To me that is a lot of fun. The moment when your stage runs out just when you finished your maneuver because you ran the numbers ... priceless. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cvbr4cf,2,t5_2smr1

It might seem like a big hurdle but spend a little time over on rbuildapc  and put together a system that will suit you better than damn near anything you could buy from a store. You might be pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to actually just build a pc for yourself.For KSP you want to focus on processing power first RAM second with the video card in third. The video card will really depend on whatever else it is you like to do. Im a fan of aviation primarily so KSP fits right in with the flight sims and those buggers can be intensive GPU pigs.Personally Ive got a couple years on an i Gb of RAM and an ATI R... something I forget on an H mboard with Win . running the show. Even have Windows running on an SSD with KSP loaded into a HDD carried over from my last build. No problems with KSP that arent related to software conflicts.

I used a slower gravity turn than normal due to the relatively low TWR.  Start turn around  ms aim for  degree ascent at  km.  Turn has to be done carefully moving your nose too far from the prograde vector will start a spin.P.P.S.  Use the nuclear engines during the whole launch.  You have plenty of excess liquid fuel and the extra thrust counts.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cvn9b1m,1,t5_2smr1

5317880,0,t3_3nt975,No they need to head in the same direction unless your doing something weird.Put the core at  meters and then put the next part at .Then finagle a rendezvous from the  meter one. Try to get within  kilometer. Execute the burn then when you get close to the core circularize. Then switch to target speed instead of orbital speed on the navball. Kill your target speed make it zero or . or something.Then point your docking port at the core and bring target speed up to  meters per second. When you get to  meters from the core kill your target speed again. Now approach at  ms. When youre  meters out kill target speed again. Click on the docking port on the core you want to dock with and select it as a target. Then click on the docking port on your craft and select control from here.This is where it gets really tricky. Orient your vessel so that the docking port is in the direction its supposed to be when you dock. It might be backwards or vertical but its got to be lined up right.Once its lined up right use rcs and your docking mode controls to shift it to the right alignment lining up with the core docking port. Now kill target speed again. If youre lined up head toward the docking port at  ms. When you get close slow down a bit  ms shouldnt break anything but it might.If you get close the two docking ports will magnetically connect.I wish you the best of luck. Remember docking and redevous is one of the hardest maneuvers youll do in KSP. Everyone has trouble with it at first and even  hour veterans have to be careful.

5322648,0,t1_cvrzcpo,Then dont. There are a huge number of tools that allow you to avoid drawing anything more than scribbles both within your image editor and in Blender itself. Use them. If you want to get fancy and use math Blender allows for every basic vector operation using them can give you a lot of control over specific regions of your model. Hell heres a tutorial for procedural scratchesgt Also metallic materials should be using glossy and diffuse fed through a mix shader with the factor being a fresnel input tuned to the refractive index of your material.Wait refractive index I dont see how that applies to reflective matierals. Ansiotropy was designed with metals in mind and is particularly useful for ones that have been scratched or brushed in some way. A glossy shader is an ansiotropic one with ansiotropy of  meaning that the metal has no surface grain from however it was polished. And if you know the basics then use them Although a rereading does say that model was an early attempt. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cvs13mh,1,t5_2smr1

5432955,0,t1_cw63tdu,gt Its true when youre flying rockets that are roughly efficient.Again the only evidence I was given is you cant go too fast that you have no real chance of getting to terminal velocity. Roughly efficient meant fast.I am aware of the idea of keeping ships light and engines are heavy. I am aware of the idea that you want to use your engines to the fullest extent that is practical. Which is why my ship is designed to run at  throttle from max Q on its just that max throttle is about .G not . as you suggest.The center liquid tank of the lift package is an orange tank.  more of these are arranged in a cross around that the outer ones have slanted fuel tank cones on the top. There is a poodle on the middle tank and mainsails on two of the side tanks with skippers on the two others.It leaves the pad with  kickbacks firing alone except for a little assist to get to ms and then when those are dropped of it goes to two mainsails and two skippers. The throttling on this is modulated until just past max Q about km and then the throttle goes to max until the orbit peaks at a hair over km. These tanks are asparagused so that the mainsail tanks run out first and then I drop the mainsails and turn on a poodle. Now it runs on two skippers and a poodle until it hits a hair over km apoapsis. Then I turn off the engines and wait until near apoapsis where I fire to circularize.When I get to the peak the two outside orange tanks have about  fuel in them the center tank is still full as full as it started about  fuel it is asparagused too. There is much too much fuel on there because I dont have the proper payload on this rocket it was designed for more. I didnt remove the extra fuel as I have done in some other configs by first removing the slanted cone tanks because since I already suspected it would get to the red polys at full bore already I didnt think lightening it up further made sense. I just basically used that extra fuel as a test payload.I really should have a config with no cone tanks and a nonfullsized center tank too but I havent rebuilt it because that makes the lift package hard to reuse the payload has to be narrow at the bottom and because this is already by far my best and perhaps only actually sane lift package I have anyway.Ill post a pic if you want.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cw6450e,1,t5_2smr1

Athena I landed the first Kerbals on Duna in the highlands Athena II put the first female Kerbals on the opposite side of the planet in a canyon and Athena III was destined to land in the polar regions. The launch and transfer went fine but landing went wrong. The landing site was too hilly so we I had to extend half of the ascent stage getting to a flat part. After landing and a few months of surface operations while waiting for the transfer window We launched. However we accidently launched into a badly inclined  degree retrograde orbit! Most of the transfer stage was used fixing the inclination so we ran out of fuel halfway through the transfer burn. We were down to monopropellant! I managed to get a km periapsis with  units of monopropellant left. Somehow we survived reentry and came down on a mountain.

5473763,0,t1_cwb5159,TLDR Firing nukes would suck the Cold War sucked even without firing nukes the world is less scary today than back then..  I remember when the game came out the devs were saying the central theme of DEFCON wasnt World War  it was how much completely unrestrained global thermonuclear war would really really suck for all parties involved all bystanders on the same planet and the family dog too.  Maybe the map the interface and the simplistic strategies are deliberately clunky to enhance the suckage.  .  I was only seven years old when the Berlin Wall fell so I cant really say I grew up during the height of the Cold War but looking back its really kind of a miracle that todays generations are happy healthy and getting an education instead of forming into small packs of orphaned naked feral adolescents from the dawn of the Neolithic era scavenging for anything edible in the few remaining patches of environment that arent a blasted wasteland of invisible sickness.Ive played with those blast radius websites enough to get a feeling for the size of a  megaton hydrogen bomb explosion before but then going and looking up how fucking many each side had pointed at the other can still give people born before the dissolution of the USSR the willies.I mean the very place you yes you reader are sitting right now?  If youre anywhere that wasnt at the time an unimportant small poor geographically distant and isolated third world country with little to no strategic worth then at any time up until  year ago or so the city or town outside the window could very well have been there one second bathed in the purest literally blinding life sterilizing white light the next second and in the following hundred seconds or so everything in a circle ten miles in diameter that wasnt reduced to radioactive dust and ash or crushed flat by the airburst shockwave would be superheated to its combustion or melting point.Im glad the spectre of M.A.D is in the past even if the policy did manage to keep the uneasy peace for those tense decades because holy fucking shit does it easily top the list of things that prove our species may indeed be fundamentally and incurably insane.  Younger adults teens and kids today just have nothing to compare it to.Sure  felt like a national threat at the time but after this many years the rhetoric about it being a declaration and act of war that we simply had to respond to with invasions and a decade of occupations and trillions of dollars and destabilizing the whole region instead looking at it as a simple criminal act that we could have swallowed the cost of in a couple of years has all pretty much evaporated.  These days ISIS and similar groups arent legitimately scary so much as they are just the newest face of the same parochial bogstandard sandfortoiletpaper bedouin slavers and bandits that have been following the same routine in the desert shithole they considered to be the entire known world for millennia till about century ago.  Any threats of theirs to invade Europe destroy America bring about a global Caliphate and such similarly impotent chestthumping bravado could only be more laughable if they went back to swinging scimitars while riding on camels with a second blade clenched between their teeth like a Disney cartoon or extras from Lawrence of Arabia.  You could start ignoring every piece of news about them completely for months on end and be entirely certain that the decision wouldnt effect your day to day life in the civilized world in any significant way.  Theyre only a threat to their immediate neighbors who are almost always nearly indistinguishable from each other except for small doctrinal differences they will happily kill each other over regarding who can be enslaved or how to publicly execute petty thieves.On the other hand during the Cold War everyone in the entire world with enough education to know the planet isnt flat woke up every single morning with a very real goddamn existential threat hanging over their heads and it could be delivered to every primary secondary and tertiary target multiple times faster than a Dominos pizza from across town.  Under thirty minutes or your secondstrike ICBM is free.  The lunacy was surreal and I too occasionally feel like slapping a baby boomer across the chops shaking them by the shoulders and demanding that they try to rationally explain just what the fuck their generation was thinking balancing peace and the fate of the world on the assumption that there wouldnt be a single silo bomber or submarine on the other side that was being commanded by a group of completely mad delusional fanatics on a psychotically bent ideological crusade..

There are currently  mods on kerbalstuff and many more in the forum It is hard to recommend anything without knowing what you like to do in KSP.But there are a couple of main flavors. The air combat crowd. BD Armory turns KSP into a full fledged air combat simulator. The Rocket Scientists. Starting with Remote tech and ending with RealismOverhaul For people who enjoy a challenge and are not afraid of math and physics.  The Kerbonauts. They play mostly stock with a mod here and there. Bob Palmers aka roverdudes mods are very  popular especially since The Martian movie came out.

Hence a surface sample base value  from Minmus will give me x for surface landed and x if I return it for a total of . Transmission efficiency is if you transmit instead of recover to RampD.Stations I still dont quite understand. But when you do an experiment or otherwise review data on vessel with a lab assuming Kerbin orbit it shows a yellow beaker button with the reset keep transmit buttons. I dont yet understand how this data value is computed.You can still remove the experiment results with a Kerbal on EVA stuff them in a command pod and bring them back home and get the science but the scientists in the lab will keep converting the data as seen on rightclicking the lab to science.To farm the Mun or Minmus for science I made a series of probes with a full set of instruments landed them in various biomes and returned them to Kerbin. Science archives from RampD shows what you have done and thus which biomes you might have missed. EVA reports from space because of its  transmission efficiency just above the biomes works too but needs a slightly inclined to fully polar orbit to cover everything. EVA report transmit rinse repeat.Thats faster than lab on surface because you can launch and recover your probes faster than the lab can convert data to science. Lab will eventually get more science. My Kerbinorbit lab generates maybe  a day. Havent put one in Mun or Minmus orbit and crewed it yet but you can doubledip.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cwr07dp,1,t5_2smr1

5883366,0,t3_3vnrak,Ooh! I have a few! I was planning a mission to minmus early in the game. To save weight I put a scientist in the command module. However I still wanted SAS so I put a probe core in a storage bay and launched my ship. As I was descending into minmus ready to land I ditched my transfer stage and fired up my landing stage only to remember that the SAS was on the other stage! I ended having to land and return to Kerbin  manually. It was nerve racking but awesome. Similar problem on my Duna lander. I was descending with my over engineered lander but partway down I realized I overestimated the slowing effects of its thin atmosphere. So I fired the thuds I had placed radially for just this purpose! Unfortunately due to clipping issues one of the rockets didnt fire making the craft unbalanced. I had to cut the rockets figure out which one didnt work disable the one across from it and refire the now only  rockets to cut my speed enough to deploy chutes all while tumbling through Dunas atmosphere. I felt so awesome when it landed safely tho. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cxquc5r,1,t5_2smr1

Then I had to watch the speed and slam the chute at about .k altitude when I finally bled down to  just in time to slow my fall to  ms at  meters up.I have now dubbed this reentry technique The Valentina Maneuver.

5934986,0,t1_cxxhji3,For that to work theres a few timewarp and patched conics issues that need fixing. For instance high timewarp levels with a brief SOI period cause some odd things to happen and severe energy changes occur which basically involves the vessel being in the SOI longer than it should be and enjoying comparatively less gravity for a bit.Also theres several possible interesting events that the user might want to be pulled out of timeskip for. For instance an asteroid that has a nice encounter with Kerbin or a different vessel having an SOI change.In the end the best way to wait for your distant encounters is to do other missions in the meantime.

5936728,0,t1_cxxffpt,Well you could use your original constellation but all  will have to point back so you need  long range antennas to maintain a single connection. The th satellite can have  short range antennas and a plethora of long range antennas. In my experience it is a lot easier because you just have to jump to a single sat to establish your connections. You could also have relay satellites in solar for better coverage and reduce your chances of having an eclipse when you need connection. The whole eclipse thing is pretty hard to manage because you have to keep in mind that it is likely that the destination planet will be in your way if you are planning to do a low altitude burn to get in orbit. If you want continue connectivity you will want to setup relay satellites in the system that you are planning a mission to and that can increase your mission cost significantly.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cxxu37p,1,t5_2smr1

5951550,0,t1_cxzowu4,For missions later in the Shuttle world like STS there were two roll manoeuvres. The first was right after takeoff and it was to orient the shuttle to the correct azimuth for its desired trajectory. The Shuttles launched from an older Saturn launch pad and the way it came out of the VAB made it sort of sideways. Plus every azimuth was different  sometimes it would fly on a nominal  degree inclination and others would be over  degrees for ISS so a roll was necessary. FUN FACT this was actually called Roll Program and included parameters of pitch and yaw in it as well.The second roll program was leading up to MECO and ET separation. The first roll puts the Shuttle on its back for ascent. This minimizes the aerodynamic load on the vehicle  because the shuttle is also an airplane the lift of the wings has to be accounted for in its trajectory and being upside down was just easier on the structure. It also places the communications antenna facing back to Earth and gives the astronauts a view of the horizon for added navigational redundancy. But starting with STS they began a roll to heads up position during the final two minutes of ascent. This pointed the antennas to the TDRS Tracking and Data Relay Satellites which gave the shuttle comms throughout its orbit.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cxzs0wt,13,t5_2smr1

6160840,0,t1_cypwkvz,Well he calibrated his parts to work with the buoyancy of the previous version of KSP. .. brought some changes to the buoyancy mechanics of the game. The specifics from squad though were less than forthcoming. So the guy was pissed he would have to rework all of his parts and that it would take a lot of time because Squad wouldnt explain the water mechanics. The water in KSP is rather an afterthought and doesnt behave as water should behave. Fluid Mechanics is a pain in the ass afterall and flotation is dependent on displacement and thus geometry and volume.  I believe every part is treated as a box by the game when in water so every boat is like a barge. This is how I understand it at least. He had a personal site and expansions all set up too.

6169640,0,t1_cyqwcvi,Thats why I said its harder until its not. Once you get used to actual aerodynamics it forces certain kinds of designs for sure but those kinds of designs are called aerodynamically stable. And if youre playing with FAR youre probably not interested in frankenrockets that generate lift because reasons so eventually you get to a point where you figure it out or you can at least see in the VAB what makes your rockets stableunstable and you wont get to Stage  and suddenly be like WHY IS MY ROCKET DOING THAT OH MY GOD.But up until that point aerodynamics is a bit of black magic and for people whove been used to stock especially pre . stock going from the typical asparagusstaging boosters to FARs more realistic style of rockets can be a difficult transition.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cyqxa5t,9,t5_2smr1

6253719,0,t3_418msx,On top of what others have said in this thread another thing that might help with control is how much thrust you are using. The air on the planet is dense and most of the resistive forces are going to be occurring at the top of your craft but all your thrust is coming from the bottom. This is why even a gentle turn with a lot of thrust will put you in an uncontrollable flip.There are a few ways to remedy this. Some way more effective than others.Less thrust. If you cut back on the thrust a bit the craft will be much more controllable as you will also decreased the counter force applied by air resistance. The drawback is efficiency the fuel efficiency of the engines in KSP does not scale linearly with thrust so cutting the throttle will give you less Delta V.Wings. This is the easiest to apply. Stabilizer fins will crate forces that keep the rocket straight. Unfortunately this also means you will have a hard time turning it and youll need to do a bit more turning right at launch to get a decent grav turn. Downsides are less  turning some drag. There was one other I was thinking and I just lost it. Ill edit if I remember again.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cz0hagu,3,t5_2smr1

What would possibly work better would be if the sort functions were Name Mass Cost Size Function with function listing the parts such as you have done.  It would also be nice if you could toggle the dividers on and off for the other categorizations and if they could be minimized Then for instance if I only want midsize fuel tanks I could minimize the Large and Small categories and get the ones I want.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,cz5fnke,1,t5_2smr1

6327079,0,t1_cz72zyw,thanks! oh Im fine with docking even in tough spaces but Ill try that with the Locked mode camera.what I do is is rotate the vehicle until the hatch on the pod is centered on my screen then the wasd keys translate correctly. otherwise its guesswork pressing S might turn left etcbut the navball thing the ball might be telling me Im going south while my heading says deg. Im guessing that because I rotated the control center in the VAB ?,KerbalSpaceProgram,cz8tixn,1,t5_2smr1
6327246,0,t1_cz8n6r5,Yes and no. When your navball is set to target mode the prograde and retrograde markers show you where you are heading relative to your target. The thing is it looks at it as if you were moving in a straight line or in this case an identical orbit to your target. So if your target velocity is anything else than zero and your altitude and inclination arent the same as your target you arent on an identical orbit.For closer distances it is ok but once you start getting a little bit away that difference in orbits makes your prograde marker drift so a neat burn that was looking straight towards your target ends up sending you way past it after some time.This effect increases over time.Once you start getting close you can view it as a landing. You match the prograde marker with the target marker just like you want to keep your lander upright relative to the ground. Then go there as fast as you want burn retrograde once you get close enough just like you would do when landing.Bonus tip This works from kilometers away btw. If I want to dock lets say a shuttle and a station I first set the control to be relative to my shuttles docking port and set my target to the port I want to dock with on the station once I get close enough for that. Then I switch to the station select the docking port I want to dock the shuttle with hit control from here and set the shuttles docking port as the stations target. So the docking ports end up being each others targets. Then I rotate the shuttle and the station so they both have their target markers dead center on the navball and give the shuttle a boost forward. So all I have to do is switch back and forth every now and then to keep the target markers in the middle and adjust the prograde marker so that sits there too while also keeping the speed within safeish limits.,KerbalSpaceProgram,cz8u7fs,2,t5_2smr1

It takes a bit of getting used to but you should be able with a bit of practice to just hover in front of the door at which point a little notification comes up saying f grab. So press f when that shows and your kerbal will latch on. Then you might need to move them up or down a bit  with ws before the next message comes up saying b board. Press b and youre back in the craft.Jet pack controls take a bit of getting used to so do a quick save before you start messing with it in case you run out of propellant. Ive only been playing a few weeks and at first the jet pack was really hard for me but now Im floating about like a boss. I found quick taps of the keys are much better than long held presses as the acceleration ramps up quite quickly in low g. To get them going as the other poster said press r.

6382257,0,t3_432lmf,Im on mobile here but from what I remember off the top of my head theres two things to remember. Most radiators with the exceptions of the vanilla thermal control systems will only cool the part theyre directly attached to. Heat does pass trough the vessel through conduction so nondirectly attached panels will have some effect but not much. Stick your radiators directly to the reactor for best effect. Note that NFs reactors are not always particularly compliant with surface attachment.. NFs reactors all have a required cooling stat visible upon inspection in the editor. Its measured in watts. Correspondingly all the radiators have a similar stat measured in watts called max cooling or something. There are actually two numbers and I forget exactly what theyre called one will be small the other will be much higher. The smaller one is what you want. Make sure you have enough radiators that their cooling powers equal or exceed the reactors required cooling. For the big ones this can mean quite a lot of reactors radiators.,KerbalSpaceProgram,czf3eap,1,t5_2smr1

That adds up to quadruple the amount of QA time to do a small update. I think Squad has been very coy about when they plan on stopping development and it really does feel like theyre going for as many preorders as possible before the whole thing comes to an end. When you look at the path theyve taken they pushed for . so they could justify the console versions being released and at no point do they plan on finishing the game proper.Bitter pill to swallow but thats really the only logical place for it all to be headed.

As a customer that means I entered that transaction with certain expectations most importantly in this scenario being the one that the money from my purchase was to go towards paying for continued development of KSP  keeping the lights on if you will.Prior to KSP exiting Early Access on Steam on that platform alone they sold a million copies of their title taking in countless millions of dollars.Can you seriously look at KSP and actually say that it looks like the kind of title that was developed with millions upon millions of dollars?With the failure via embezzlement of titles such as Ant Simulator Id say its wise  for the continued health of the crowdfunding and Early Access programs utilized by many  to question where all that money went.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d00rqjz,-13,t5_2smr1

6681344,0,t1_d09avfc,Rover cabins were never used in space flight before so its very difficult to build something somewhat realistic I guess. The reason is you would only need cabins if you wanted to cross huge distances without doing much science on the way. If you get out frequently to study the environment you better just save the weight and use no cabin at all and instead sit in your space suit on the rover like Apollo did. Thats why we have those neat command seats. What you see in the mod looks great but it is based on a movie so its pretty much science fiction which Squad stated not to add to the game.

I would guess that you simply arent mining enough ore to supply  converter and probably not enough to even fully supply the  converter thus  converter is inactive. If this is the case to solve the problem you would need more drills. Perhaps many many more drills. Alternately you could just use time warp drills and converter still work during time warp.If you are actively generating extra ore though and this extra ore is going into an ore tank instead of into the nd converter i dont know what to tell you.

I put KER on because realistically I should have access to exactly how much Delta V I have. I you could argue that I could do the math for it but if you think Rockets in real life arent designed and simulated on computers and its all done by hand no sir. Love the game though. Just flying my command post to the Mun right now to scout a good spot and drop it off. I went and landed on Gilly last night I will never go back there. I planned for low gravity and put lets off the top and bottom so I could lay flat sideways. Still take  mins to stay on the ground and I landed like this it also took me  minutes of RCS thrusting off my Kerbin intercept on the way back because thats all I had left.

Maybe even more so for the first since youre experiencing an aftward acceleration due to drag that will throw all the fuel forward in the tanks. This is also why I put realism in quotes since its not quite there.The reason I dont have it for the second burn is simply because I couldnt figure out a way to automatically detect when multirelight ullage configurations are present. Ive considered implementing a requiresUllage TF flag that would use RCS ullage if solid isnt already used but havent gotten around to that.

What I am currently using in an arduino due It has support of native USB which can act like a keyboard using the keyboard library that comes in the Arduino IDE.

6912355,0,t1_d0zqnwq,gt If you have unused memory and nothing else on your system is asking for it Linux will fill it up with cached or buffered data. The theory is if youre leaving memory unused then why bother having it at all? If another application comes along and wants memory Linux will quickly free the cached data and let something else use it.Windows does the same thing its called Superfetch. However it shouldnt effect your perapp RAM usage at least on Windows its stored under a separate process.The changes are large. Makes me wonder if the bit application is keeping the textures compressed and the bit application is storing them uncompressed.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d0zu4o9,2,t5_2smr1

What you would need to do is look at the part file for the high gain antenna and make note of the part name.  Then if you open your save game in a text editor you can find your ship.

7226766,0,t3_4eca2s,basically on earth or kerbin in this case we have air and water and land so if you heat something up the matter around it also gets heated this takes away the heat from that object i.e. placing a hot piece of metal in water will cause the heat to move from the metal to the water cooling the metal down.pretty simple stuff no? well in space when theres practically no matter around this doesnt really happen so say a craft that has engines which create really hot gasses this gas heat up the metal of the craft but this time the heat has nowhere to go so radiators rely on another way that heat can get moved around and thats radiation they are made of lots of thin material so it has a large surface area and as the craft heats up so does the radiator however when the radiator gets hot it glows and the heat is removed as light this is much slower that conduction.I hope you were asking about this and not just why we need them in ksp to which Id say the devs implemented a heat model to the game which can cause your ship to explode if some particular engine parts basically just the nuke engines run for too long Dedit oh yeah and in real life they pump a liquid around the craft which takes heat from the craft to the radiators using conduction D,KerbalSpaceProgram,d1zmny4,1,t5_2smr1

7255629,0,t3_4errkz,Cool ship. You do know you can take fertilizer instead of supplies? Fertilizer is about x more efficient. Theres no reason you ever need the amount of supplies you have on that ship. In fact you dont need the amount of Fertilizer or Mulch that ship can carry either.  Fertilizer a .m can for a  man crew will keep them alive for about  years when used to grow plants.Oh and mulchkerbal poop. It doesnt make sense to haul mulch into space. Kerbals eat supplies and poop out mulch. You convert the mulch back into supplies by growing plants in the Agricultural Module  which uses a small amount of fertilizer to do.Take a small amount of supplies to seed the recycle loop a lot of fertilizer but not what you think a lot means and make sure you have space to hold mulch as little as possible  you just dont want to lose mulch which could happen if you had no place to store it.

7396006,0,t1_d2iuc18,i agree with the bit about hearing breathing during EVA. but then I have to say that in that same train of thought I agree with being able to hear sounds similar to what would be heard inside the vessel of focus... so the ship rather than the space suit. In that case youd still hear the engines to some degree because the vibrations would still travel through the ship. It wouldnt be silent unless your perspective was that of the camera in which case you wouldnt hear EVA breathing. now dont get me wrong Im not one of the people who wants every aspect of the game to be ultimately realtistic... I want it to be fun! I want sound effects that make every moment of the game more engaging. the silence of the vacuum of space has a time and a place for adding to the atmosphere ironic use of that word but its the only word I can think of for the purpose of being in deep space.. For instance in games like Elite Dangerous when your canopy gets broken and you lose cabin pressure and suddenly it all goes quiet... thats a good use of silence. it makes it SO intense in the last  or  minutes before you die in space. but I dont really think that is that important in a game like KSP. i want sound. i need to be engaged with auditory feedback because its not am immersive game. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,d2ivle8,1,t5_2smr1

7438185,0,t1_d2nnvc8,From my experience in KSP the shape of the wing doesnt matter as long as the CoL remains behind the CoM. From my understanding this is because of KSPs aerodynamic model. When calculating lift and drag it only cares about the Angle of Attack of the individual parts not the overall shape of the wing So if you counteract the forward lift of the forward swept wing with canards at the back or by moving the swept wing backward the plane should fly just fine.Also Ive built the plane so that CoM does not shift very much in flight. The engine mass is balanced by the mass of the cockpit. RCS balancer is an invaluable tool here because it shows both the CoM and the dry CoM at the same time allowing you to place your wings appropriately.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d2no9cb,5,t5_2smr1

It sinks like a rock.It seems to me that the main issue with Eve submarines is propulsion and fuel storage. Fuel tanks like to float and increase in buoyancy as they empty.

For a class abc maybe at the closest point to kerbin  if it comes ltkm. latch on hit retrograde until you close the orbit then tune.For D you will want to capture it further out. Maybe mine it.For E you will definitely want an intercept far away as possible mine it and start pushing retrograde. If you want it as a refueling station then also get the inclination  to . A ship with  nukes will have enough power to do this although a bit slower. The main thing in every case is to close the orbit then you have time to make the other adjustments. Oh and if it is on a crash intercept you will want to change that first from far out. For mining you wont get much from anything less than an D. The more you mine you lower the mass of the asteroid and the easier it is to move.

7791520,0,t3_4m1ttq,Been working on this for a few weeks. My first kOS script heavily updated since the last video now working for any starting TWR obviously greater than  and virtually any rocket size in only  lines of code not including the data readouts which are there for debugging purposes.Now that its working I need to clean it up a little and tune the functions a little better since you can see in the video that the AOA isnt always although its pretty close for most of the atmospheric ascent. You could theoretically Ive only been able to test these four rockets and I was mostly testing for starting TWR and not so much for other design factors launch any rocket with this script provided it has the fuel and control authority to make it to the target orbit.Its hard to see since the video is sped up so much this was originally around  minutes but on the very last rocket I turned on infinite fuel in order to demonstrate the scripts ability to tame even the most ridiculously overpowered rocket.PSsorry if you dont like metal. Also not sorry.EDIT home now and added the script hereEDIT I knew something didnt look quite right on the AOA readout. The sideslip is I guess what I should be looking at when thinking of my AOA since I guess Im technically yawing relative to my craft not pitching. Jeez. That makes a lot more sense.

Hell the game itself has various difficulty settings.If hes having fun who cares whether he does the tedious busy work of getting it absolutely perfect?There are plenty of people who edit in duplicate satellites too.

8069575,0,t1_d4myo8g,What if it lasts for all eternity...?What if in  years ages after a the extinction of humans or b eventual transcendence into an interplanetary utopian society aliens land on Earth. At this point their technology is so advanced that they have machines implanted in their brains that use hyperquantum algorithms that can decode any possible language ever. So they land in the middle of Silicon Valley which at this point is in absolute shambles because it was abandoned. They see a lone Windows  laptop in the middle of the streets completely undamaged for thousands upon thousands of years. They pick it up only to see The ladder just got ten feet taller! Suddenly their language decoding machines malfunction because the aliens have not in all their years of existence invented the ladder or anything remotely similar to it. Not knowing how this is possible the aliens assume this ladder is a supernatural entity that can expand upon command and begin to worship it as a deity. Eventually more alien colonists arrive and the religion of Ladderism spreads like wildfire. One very important aspect of Ladderism is daily prayer which involves the followers shouting The ladder just got ten feet taller! at the sky as soon as they wake up right before and after every meal and right before they go to sleep some of the devout believers sometimes even get up in the middle of the night just to pray. And when they do this the longdead skeleton of Donald Trump comes back to life even if just for a moment and sheds a single tear knowing that even the aliens want the wall to get higher.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d4n3hjw,12,t5_2smr1

They should be reinvesting in their product or at least working on significant paid additions DLC if they need the cash or KSP  I guess. They should be able to hire someone to work on this.That being said its also likely higherups are using KSP to fund other projects and not reinvesting. I am glad the developers care about the game and the community so much they feel comfortable asking for help however it does point to some internal problems that do not bode well for KSPs continued future support.I love KSP and am grateful for all the updates so far but I do not want to see that kind of serious support ending especially with a release on a new platform. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,d56bkbp,16,t5_2smr1

8492641,0,t3_4vruwv,The thing that screwed me up I started playing an early beta before it was officially released was the complete lack of instructions ingame.  Theyve since solved this with some tutorials and instructions. Use them.Pressing M will cycle you back and forth between seeing your rocket and seeing the map view. This is really helpful when you are trying to get to orbit.Dont go straight up. Going into orbit involves going up then going sideways really really fast. You will spend  of your fuel going sideways. If you just go straight up you will either go up forever escaping Kerbins gravity or you will go up and fall back.People tend to overbuild especially when you are trying to land on the Mun for the first time. Keep it light then you dont need such large fuel tanks and engines. Once I figured out that I can land a tiny unmanned probe on the Mun or Minmus using only RCS thrusters the game completely changed for me.Scott Manley has a very good channel on youtube with lots of instructions.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d634nqv,2,t5_2smr1

They can afford to deal with projects like OpenArena because they made their money licensing their proprietary game engines.  Realistically they probably only released the source code years later because the engines werent cutting edge any more harder to sell licenses.  By releasing the source they made their competitors aging technology irrelevant.If Squad were to follow their model all the assets in the game would be replaced in a month a la FreeDoom or OpenArena they would have no exclusive IP thats worth anything and they would go out of business.

A tug would basically just be a ship with a docking portclaw to hook up to a station module and an engine in the back to push it off.Could you provide a bit of extra information?

8932526,0,t1_d7lgf3k,Well you can obviously use whatever engines you like. If you want your station to have lots of thrust then the Mammoth is the way to go probably. Its just that some engines are better suited for certain tasks. Some engines are just very fuel efficient for example Terrier Poodle Nerva ... . That means you dont need to bring as much fuel and therefore save some weight. Also engine performance degrades when you enter an atmosphere. Thrust gets lower while fuel consumption stays the same. Most of the more efficient engines will lose a loooot of thrust in atmospheres which makes them useless for takeoff from Kerbin. Others are working well.

9041241,0,t3_5430fx,Regarding your takeoff problem  try moving your landing gear forward.  If you cant take off before the end of the runway and have to run off the end in order to pitch up your landing gear is too far back.  Remember as you take off the gear briefly acts as a fulcrum with the plane as the lever upon which the plane angles itself upwards  if the fulcrum is too far from the CoM a lot more force is needed to achieve the desired angle and therefore take off.  Its usually a good idea to put the rear landing gear just behind the CoM.  This might also help with the exploding gear  its likely that the gear is exploding because your plane is suddenly pitching up once the nose runs off the end of the runway which suddenly transfers a lot of weight onto the rear landing gear.  If your gear keep exploding even after you move them closer to the CoM try using bigger gear.  It looks like youre using the small landing gear LY for both the front and rear landing gear its generally a good idea to use one size up so the medium LY gear in your case for the rear wheels since they have to take more weight.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,d7ym2vl,3,t5_2smr1

9168762,0,t3_55t3i1,Its all about the mods. By itself KSP is a joyful little game of space and explosions. The huge mod library turns it into a generalpurpose spacegame engine thats the foundation for dozens of different space games. You can play a hardcoreserious space sim based in our actual solar system. You can play space war games with interplanetary destroyers and cruisers battling for control. You can fly incrediblydetailed handcrafted models of literally everything thats ever reached space from Nazi Vs through the new monster boosters coming soon from SpaceX and Blue Origins. In addition to rockets the full game  mods lets you design your own planes ships subs and ground vehicles. Thats never been my thing but lots of players clearly love it and I benefit from their hard work.Once I built a oneway interstellar manned mission launched it then installed a mod that completely revamped the Kerbal solar system. My crew was there for life having to scrounge among completely unknown worlds for fuel oxygen and water. Thanks to a couple more mods they had realistic lifesupport needs and had to be protected from radiation too.I started another game deciding life on Kerbin was doomed! My space program had five years and  billion currency to build a selfsupporting colony on Duna and move as many colonists as possible. I had over fifty ships enroute at a time which would have been unworkable in the vanilla game. But the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod makes such complex schedules possible.The only question you need to ask yourself is how into space are you? If its a lot then you wont run out of things to do in KSP for years. Im closing in on my third anniversary and still playing. If you buy it download version .. the . preview isnt ready and has very few mods until later and the mod CKAN which is a mod catalog and manager.Happy flying!,KerbalSpaceProgram,d8e7iba,1,t5_2smr1

The mods were under opensource licenses and didnt state not to fork them and they are hosted on GitHub a community which historically has thrived on people forking others code to make it better so they had no real reason not to go ahead with the fork.Dont get me wrong Im all for modders rights to their own mods they do the community a fantastic service by keeping them updated and have no doubt extended KSPs life enormously. That said if a modder feels a certain way about how theyd like their mod treated I believe its within reason for them to state this ahead of time to avoid situations like this thread.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d8emxrj,1,t5_2smr1

9218714,0,t1_d8kj6qz,Simply put yes. That is also true when leaving from Kerbin to the mun. If you can time your departure and do a burn to get there without orbiting the body you are leaving first you save some fuel I think dont quote me on it. Then when you have escaped the influence of the body you are leaving getting into Kerbin orbit for the return trip the best thing is to reduce your perigee so that it is going through the thick part of the atmosphere below k altitude. By doing that you let the drag do most of the work getting your speed down called aerobraking. Note that in this case I still had to fire my engines before reentry to prevent the poor exposed Kerbal to burn up. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,d8kjfnb,6,t5_2smr1

Its cheap to upgrade anyway.Finally if you want to do a certain kind of contract just decline the other ones this causes a small rep hit but there are diminishing returns on rep anyway and tourism contracts award so much rep that even on hard the decline penalty is no big deal.

9544271,0,t1_d9pejvv, dV when you are piloting manually with only proretro lock on for pilot skills is more than enough for an Apollo style CSMLander type mission. This one had enough to enter a km orbit of Mun and then directly reenter from orbit safely just burn retro at km until out of fuel then eject the stage at km to take away the heat.And if you are really crazy you can do it like me and reenter with the lander still attached. After the burning air stops just spin the ship so the lander goes first the parachutes will slow it down to about  ms. Unfortunately the landing struts and engines cant take that impact on land nor can the solar panels even if they are stowed away oddly but everything else from the fuel tank up will survive which let me double tap science with data from where I landed on Kerbin.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d9pj1su,2,t5_2smr1

9547814,0,t1_d9ppxzb,Well I am long time AMD fanboy. The thing with heat of CPUs if you avoid FX XX class you are good to go. However there are two problems. First the BOXED coolerfan can be thrown right away and aftermarket must be bought but total the price is OK even with this  this is minor issue. In case you want the raw power of  Ghz x is quite a kick be ready to go into decent water cooling  you will need a very good power source W. Yeap this is classic AMD as we know it. On the other hand from what I have seen it pays off in performance it is a mad CPU even with those temperatures it can be overclocked as far as you own your private nuclear reactor to runncool it.In terms of OC all FX family is your friend it aint problem to clock FX  to  Ghz per core but at your own risk and it need water cooling and super power source. Furthermore imho from my dated y experience you will live in permanent risk of burning out your rig. So decision is yours.Bigger thing is all you can get hand on right now on CPU field is AM socket. It is dated technology y and even though it is sufficient it wont see any better CPU than from current portfolio. The next gen ZEN will be or we are being said so built on new socket entirely with no chance of pluging it in AM. Furthermore the ZEN is being delayed and I think as Intel gets new and new generation of ii AMD is trying to catch up but is too slow. Is it a problem? Well currently might be but the AM CPUs will be enough for gaming for a year or two without doubt. If the rest of the PC is optimised to the CPU it will last years. however as will time go so will your game settings decrease  In GPU field the heating imho aint any issue now and if you keep cool head and do not grab the absolute high end you will be good. But this goes for nVidia.Currently overall AMD is very good choise if you target decent gaming experience and if you do not plan to upgrade your CPU in near future as it will require MBD change whenif Zen arrives. What does it mean? If you do not need VR or k you cannot make a bad choise with AMD. However if any from mentioned is your target I would rather stick to intelnVidia combo just now. But prepare the budget accordingly and as a paradox will be faster moral aging of your rig.,KerbalSpaceProgram,d9pyr12,2,t5_2smr1

9645004,0,t1_da1w1xf,That just comes with experience and practice.  My hand is used to my keyboard so when I place my fingers on WASD my pinky naturally falls on Shift and then I know in the back of my mind that the key below is Control.  Shift is always in roughly the same place on most keyboards after all.  Left hand on IJKL and right hand on right ShiftCtrl wont serve you very well.  Youll need your left hand on WASD and right hand on IJKL.  Docking unlike atmospheric flight requires not only rotation but translation along all three axes.  WASD controls rotation as usual IJKL controls translation.  On the bright side if you can manage to rendezvous with any modicum of decency rendezvous really isnt too hard once youve done it once or twice and figured it out you should be fine with using RCS alone to close the gap between vessels meaning you will not have to also be worrying about ShiftCtrl.  The point I was trying to make was that its not worth remapping throttle to the other side of the keyboard because given that  the two main control groups are WASD and IJKL and  if youre using IJKL youre most likely also using WASD so your left hand wont be free its ergonomically most favourable to use left ShiftCtrl because that ShiftCtrl group is closer to its respective control group.  I honestly find it hard to believe that the problem is as extreme as you make it out to be.  Unless youre a barrelchested bear of a person playing on one of those tiny tablet computers which if I may is a pretty funny mental image using WASD and IJKL at the same time shouldnt pose much of a problem ergonomically provided youve got good seating and posture.  After all even when you type normally your index fingers should rest on F and J which are even closer together than WASD and IJKL.  The majority of us do fine with the default controls and in fact we use similar controls in plenty of other firstperson games where Shift makes the character sprint and Ctrl makes the character crouch.  It might take practice to get used to but Im sure you arent really as tight on brain capacity as you say.  It takes a special type of mind to get interested in KSP after all.  Give yourself a little credit If you do decide to eschew the keyboard the Xbox controller would probably work fine.  I mentioned a HOTAS just for the realism of using an actual throttle and joystick but if ergonomics are more important to you then by all means a gamepad would indeed be the better option and would be more than sufficient to allow you to have all of the basic functions close at hand.  ,KerbalSpaceProgram,da1y2hr,1,t5_2smr1

The pitching moment coefficient also plays a role since its necessary to maintain the angle of attack to perform the turn it generally decreases with airspeed and so decreases the angle of attack which is why aircraft with high power loading or power or thrusttoweight ratios are more maneuverable in most cases since they keep their airspeed and thus pitching moment coefficient high.,KerbalSpaceProgram,db2wq7i,2,t5_2smr1

I watch and enjoy his videos but he recently made a comment during his stream about console players throwing a fit about game crashes while PC players just accept it as part of the experience.Well Scott its not that simple. I watched on your livestream as you simply restarted KSP and went back to playing. On console its not that easy. About half of crashes on PS at least result in a corrupt data file and we lose EVERYTHING. All save games designs even options settings. We cant simply quit our whining. The ONLY way around it is to manually back up your data after any session that doesnt crash and keep sessions to one activity returning to VAB after a flight is almost a guaranteed crash with data corruption.

If you are particularly brave you could also try to do an EVA transfer at altitude by bringing the rescue ship into a very low orbit and using the remaining fuel in the lander to jump up to it for long enough to fly everyone over though I doubt you would have time for more than one.To get fuel into the lander you have on the Mun already you would need a docking port that another ship could reach and that can crossfeed to your fuel tanks.

10157498,0,t3_5lf4wk,Youre right about generally using more powerful engines on the lower stages when your rocket is heavier and using the less powerful engines on the upper stages. However just going by thrust levels alone you will end up running into some problems.What you need to do is develop a kind of mental slidingscale that all the engines can sit on so you can more easily compare them to each other. For now well ignore things like cost and engine weight and focus only on thrust power and efficiency. When you read an engines description there are two numbers that should jump out at you. One is the thrust which is pretty obvious. The second is the specific impulse or Isp and that one is a bit more tricky. Put extremely simply Isp is a measure of how much impulse your engine gets for every kilogram of fuel it uses. If you take an engine producing any amount of thrust in newtons and give it that same number in kilograms of fuel the specific impulse will be how long it takes to burn up all of that fuel. An engine that takes more time to use up all its fuel than another engine at the same level of thrust is more efficient and would get a rocket up to a higher speed. In space speed is everything.How a rockets thrust vs efficiency stacks up determines where they are most useful. A solid rocket booster is not very efficient but offers high thrust so its good for providing a boost early in a flight when the vehicle is fighting gravity the hardest. A vacuum optimized liquid fuel engine can be very efficient in space but generally they dont have high thrust and get even worse thrust in an atmosphere. Therefore they are best suited for operating on upper stages and in deep space. Liquid fuel booster engines generally have less thrust than a similarly sized solid booster but have better efficiency making them good for lower stages. The Mainsail is a good example of a high powered liquid fuel engine good for getting off the ground. For many engines certain rocket designs can be a benefit or a drawback. The Rhino for example gets about half of the thrust at sea level as it does in space and is very efficient for its size  so a launch vehicle with side mounted boosters will get the most performance out of the engine. The Mammoth has lots of thrust and is not very efficient so adding side boosters is a wasted effort. A better design would be to use efficient upper stage engines rather than trying to get more performance out of the first stage in that case. The Skipper behaves similarly to the Rhino but is less efficient so some side boosters and a big efficient upper stage are both good design choices to have. The Aerospike has very efficient and powerful thrust for its size so it makes a very good stand alone first stage engine. When it comes to probes a good idea is to pick the tiniest and lightest engine you can that still gives you useful thrust. You dont need a lot of thrust in space in fact I often fly several ton probes that have one single Ant engine because it can offer lots of delta V for the price of patience. You can also use undersized but efficient engines on upper stages of launch vehicles as long as your first stage gets you high and fast enough. A single Spark on an FLT can boost itself plus about a ton and a half of payload all the way out to Minmus.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dbveq8y,2,t5_2smr1

For highly eccentric orbit matching it helps to understand the purpose of the radial burn in step  you want your orbits to be touching at one point and most importantly you want your periapsis and apoapsis to be in a line with your targets PE and AP.The last bit is the important one you can always burn at AP or PE to make your orbits touch later the point of burning radially is to align your PE and APs.  For really eccentric orbits it helps to break that radial burn into two steps aligning PEAP and THEN burning at PE or AP to make orbits touch at one point.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dc3anre,1,t5_2smr1

Add a Rapier at the end. Looks like were going to need some wings just take the thick small one you know with fuel Inside. Not the biggest Delta ! The smallest thick triangle able to carry some liquid fuel. Actually feed them with some fuel lets say half of their capacity which should be something like  each.Add some control surfaces behing thses thick wings your CoL blue should be somewhere close behind your CoM orange. And of course  landing gears the two at the rear should be placed somewhere close behind the CoM too.Launch it full thrust climb by  and even with this not perfect ascension trajectory you should be fine !

Of course that loses the spectacular RUDs but maybe they could be added in another way.If on the other hand the port is a halfarsed job that does little beyond the bare minimum to make the game run like we saw with PS and XBone then KSP on Switch will be rubbish.,KerbalSpaceProgram,ded8hfb,3,t5_2smr1

Burn time is how long you need to burn your engines and time to node is well time until your burn would theoretically start. However that wont work very well for burns over about  seconds so you need to divide the burn time by  and start that much ahead of the node.Imagine you have a time to node of m s and a burn time of s.  so you would begin your burn when time to node becomes s.

11436678,0,t1_dfs4ocv, This should be using the most uptodate aerodynamic model. Remember to add  to all values to account for pilot error and Oberth losses.Eg. Going to the Mun landing and return to Kerbin. Launch to Low Kerbin Orbit CisMunar Transfer Orbit Munar Capture Ascent Stage v msMunar Transfer Stage v msLanding Ascent to Low Munar Orbit Lander v msKerbin Return Transfer Return v msAerobrake in Kerbin Atmosphere to Unpowered landing From here you work backwards. Build a lander that can land and ascend and possibly directly return to Kerbin then build the necessary transfer vehicle then build a lifter to put all of that in orbit.Remember that for Apollo Style missions or interplanetary missions with motherships your Transfer Stage must include both the outgoing and incoming legs of the trip although you may leave the lander or other equipment behind. You can also just build a lander capable of returning on its own but that means youre bringing parachutes and heat shields to the Munar surface.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dfsc453,2,t5_2smr1

11624827,0,t1_dgdmdaw,Ill try assuming folks know a little about kOS and the main thing Im trying to figure out right now in it PID Control LoopsFor anyone interested heres my Work in Progress script  Youll also need my Functions Library file with my janky PID control tuning bits  Keep in mind I havent programmed since taking a PASCAL class in highschool in the early s.  So forgive my code.  This has been a learning experience.The basic premise is set up a landing zone in the middle of the KSC runway latlng. ..  Based on if Im approaching from the West like from a typical orbit or from the east I set a landing zone  meters from the center towards the closer end.I set up  way points at increasing distances from the LZ for now at km km and km.  The point of these is to set up an approach hopefully parallel to the runway. The  subsequent ones These may not be needed when coming in from an orbit but I was testing this with a partially fueled version of the SSTO which does a big Uturn throwing off the approach angle.   The first one is at m altitude to make sure I dont slam into Mt. Whoopstooshort when approaching from the West.  The subsequent ones drop altitude to  and  m.Assuming I make it to the runway once crossing the LZ or hitting m altitude which ever comes first I level out my pitch drop gears and throttle down.  Theres a bunch of bugs still to be worked out obviously like the whole crashing into the hangar.The heart and soul of the script are the  PID Loops.  Theres a loop ton control ascentdescent rate which of course affects speed.  This makes the next PID loop complicated as it maintains speed ms for this script for now and the rd PID tries to hold altitude by controlling the ascentdescent loop.  Everything interacts and Im still trying figure PID loops out in general.  Theres a LOT of oscillations.  To make tuning the PID loops easier I put in a temporary manual adjustment subroutine QWEASD adjust the Kp Ki and Kd of the ascentdescent PID RTYFGH for altitude hold and UIOJKL for speedthrottle.  They output to the screen and you need to manually change them in the Script file as they wont be retained after ending the program  crashing the plane.The good news is if I go with putting in a keep to the center of the runway PID loop it shouldnt really interact with the other ones.  My main worry is oscillations there would be really really bad.  I need to figure out the deadzone function.If you download the script and want to adjust the PID constants youll need to decomment the getinput. lines.  I was trying to debug some stuff and wanted to simplify things now that Ive tuned the PID loops well enough.  Im guessing the constants will need to be adjusted for your own planeSSTO.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgdopac,2,t5_2smr1

11754663,0,t1_dgrqa99,it might be difficult but i you could stager it over a few weeksmonths of it switching the color very slowly.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgsf5n0,1,t5_2smr1
11762693,0,t1_dgt8dt0,BAE paid m for a  stake in the Skylon company last OctoberThe prototype SABRE engine is currently in production with the first ground test planned in a couple of years.I guess they havent got much to report until that test happens.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgtbwsd,6,t5_2smr1
11765490,0,t1_dgthbzz,Well that robotic arm was cooped up in there.  I dont actually have any payload but plan to use it to deorbit  rescue things along with shuttling personnel to my space station.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgtnco3,1,t5_2smr1

11793527,0,t1_dgwlvnh,If you want to go with a slightly more realistic endeavor you can pick up the eva strut mod. It lets you set up one side of the strut and then you do an eva to drag the other side to where you want it. I use it in most of my space station and orbital shipbuilding. Its a fun way to keep EVA missions relevant.,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgwu3yo,4,t5_2smr1
11798360,0,t1_dgxbhnu,The fact that we dont have it already is fairly silly. I dont understand why Squad is making new part classes without fleshing out the existing catalog and creating more design consistency. ,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgxduxd,9,t5_2smr1

11807625,0,t1_dgye6de,Career isnt the worst way to start its just that its easy to softlock a save in career without knowing you need to balance cost vs earnings or to build a rocket with too many basic parts and not understand why it wont go to the launch pad.The contracts are definitely a good way to train a newbie for advancement but getting to orbit and understanding the basics of science gathering are arguably a more important initial focus,KerbalSpaceProgram,dgyfofs,1,t5_2smr1
