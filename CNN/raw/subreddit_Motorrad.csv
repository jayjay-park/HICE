When you open the throttle a lot of gas surges in to the carb I dont know what you call the area where the air and fuel actuall mix. The plastic disk keeps fuel from flowing backwards into the main jet and back into the bowl.I called the Bing Agency in Kansas and basically got this same info and ordered the carb manual.

4079187,0,t1_crl8613,I have a fair amount of off road experience but am new to the big GS. A lot carries over but I spent probably a month training. Prior to the event I also attended a BMW OffRoad rider training event that was specifically for people going on this Safari. They do three of these a year each a different difficulty. This one is the Enduro which is the most difficult so you can build up to it. As a part of the package you can ship your bike from anywhere in Australia to the event or hire bikes. This one was more grueling than I thought mainly because of the heavy sand. You might like to check out last years Enduro or the GS Safari medium difficulty.Absolutely incredible event and superb organisation by BMW. Couldnt fault anything. There are medics and BMW techs on bikes as backup with support vehicles. It allows you to push it more than you ever would unsupported. Any questions at all let me know. ,Motorrad,crl9407,2,t5_2tp7m

8568312,0,t3_4x46gn,Define mud was it thick or was it muddy water? From what you are describing it was the latter. The display is more or less water resistant not water proof. It is not an unreliable component when used within the means it was designed for. Yes you bought a GS but that does not mean it can be submerged in water and still work. From what you described and if you said to the dealer it stopped after you did that to it. They can deny warranty based on customer abuse. ,Motorrad,d6cmb6g,1,t5_2tp7m
