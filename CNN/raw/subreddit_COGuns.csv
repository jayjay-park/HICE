3386567,0,t3_2yyorr,Yes absolutely. Currently they are totally legal for rich people. Not only is the law in direct violation of the nd amendment but its a restriction that only prohibits the poor. ,COGuns,cpeanff,12,t5_353d5

5576385,0,t1_cwo2omk,I have direct experience with that D printer except is was branded as a Makerbot. The machine itself works well and dual extruders are really helpful. Being able to dissolve PLA supports makes it easier to print more complex models like receivers. Ive also printed soft parts using NinjaFlex filament. One of the comments on the Monoprice product pages says that it works with the Makerbot software so if you were to get one I could be of some help in that area too.Learning to D model will let you get the most out of a printer. Its rare that you print a model and have it be perfect the first time. The gunrelated models Ive printed have all required some modification to fit up to actual gun parts. Id recommend Inventor because its a fully functional D CAD package and you can download it for free without pirating it! You just need to fib a little bit Id be glad to show you the basics of the program.My friend back in NY actually put together one of the  receivers we printed so I know its close enough but it took us a while to get there. You can get the  model from the FOSSCAD megapack Whole pack with the most recently added models Just the  receiver The only makerspace that advertises welding and machining facilities is Tinkermill. Im not sure if its worth mo to me. Its also in Longmont. I should go check out their open house that is apparently every Sunday.I might need to take you up on your offer for the  lowers. My apartment doesnt lend itself to machining and my garage is full of motorcycles.Speaking of ARs... If I had a D printer this is the first model Id makeIts a bolt together AR. The whole reason why I never printed an AR lower is because Id need to cut the model in half because it wont fit on the printer bed and then itd take over a day for each part. Long prints are terrible so much can go wrong. This is perfect since its all small pieces.,COGuns,cwoawfi,2,t5_353d5
