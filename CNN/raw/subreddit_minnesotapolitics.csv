6807315,0,t3_48zmvj,I vehemently disagree with GMO labeling. Its fearmongering nothing more. Why not force food manufacturers to use the official chemical names of all ingredients while youre at it if you want to scare consumers? Would you eat food with RRSSRSSSRdihydroxybishydroxymethyloxolanyloxyhydroxymethyloxanetriol? Too scary? Thats sucrose table sugar.GMO is simply a more efficient way of introducing genetic variation instead of hopeandpray hybridization just stick the genes you want where you want. Its not scary and doesnt require labeling.,minnesotapolitics,d0nwlac,22,t5_2sgxl
