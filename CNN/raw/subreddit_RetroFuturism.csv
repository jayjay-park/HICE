Made by using a different isotope I think its one or two atomic numbers off from the regular stuff but reacts better. Caused a problem with early reactors where they would self posing where the wrong element was made and ate up all the spare electrons kicking about in the reactor. One of the early bomb problems was they could fizzle out and just sit there as a large horrible hot horribly radioactive blob rather than a big mushroom cloud. ,RetroFuturism,cpse4p0,2,t5_2repb

Theres no buttons behind the where you would have to reach akwardly around or through the wheel. Not to mention the design of the wheel itself which makes it much harder to feel how far it is turned for steeringfinding the buttons without looking.        The display behind the wheel is more readable as it doesnt have corners cut off by the wheel. The small display up top is closer the the road and makes it easier to quickly read important information while moving.        The change from beige leather to white plastic is a good one IMO. Apple didnt invent the white plastic look its become a common theme in many consumer goods because of its durability and ease of manufacture.

I mean humans really really suck at driving.I dont think its totalitarian. Should you be allowed to walk on railroad tracks? No its an obvious safety hazard.gtAs long as the car exhaust is filtered ideally completely using future technology then cars wouldnt be a huge problem like they are now.Pollution from use is only part of the problem with cars they are also dangerous leading to quite a few deaths every year and they are expensive creating an arguably unnecessary financial hardship for many people and encourage carcentric urban design which is basically the same thing as inefficient urban design.,RetroFuturism,d5aon8z,2,t5_2repb

Better sleep cycles stronger mental healthability. Only side effect I experienced so far is lightheadedness a few times.

As Ive pointed out several times my point is simply that I question whether the sci fi of the time was any more visionary than sci fi nowA lot of the visionary tech they wrote about was contemporary to them. Whether people in general knew about it or not or were inspired by it or not does not change that.Thats the only thing Ive been arguing.When it comes to sci fi inspiring people we agree and Ive agreeing with that all along.gt Still what faroff tech that we cant even begin to imagine how we would create is popular in scifi now?I dont know  my point is that I dont think theres ever been all that much of that outside of a relatively limited number of relatively obvious magic items such as devices to let us travel wherever or whenever or items to heal us  ideas that have been present pretty much forever in literature and where sci fi gave them fancy names in some cases more than a century ago.

9316758,0,t1_d8wxltx,Its probably because of things like the second series of Look Around You and generally looking back on these past predictions of the future and realizing how wrong they were. They basically always underestimated progress in computing and overestimated everything else. We have no moon bases no cities on Mars no household robots to do our laundry etc. Were starting to see cybernetic implants but theyre still extremely crude compared to what was imagined a few decades ago. We have robots that can walk but they cost millions and are completely unreliable outside of controlled environments.I think people are more informed about technology these days and expect better more substantiated predictions. And theyre less naive too for instance more wary about potential abuses of technology. So I think the bar is just higher than it was in the s. Not to mention much of the target audience dont actually watch TV anymore.,RetroFuturism,d8wyuds,2,t5_2repb

Verne is reaching back to the very beginning but even Star Trek TOS would probably come across as retrofuturism.Idealism is a good description imo it reflects a time of unbridled optimism in technological changes whereas cyberpunk is almost the opposite unmitigated pessimism about technological progresss capacity to improve human life.You can probably guess which one I believe to be more topical although the truth is probably in the middle.Technological change can make things better but wont fix all of our problems the way people in the Golden and Silver Ages of Science Fiction seemed to think it might.There is one example of technopessimism even more extreme than cyberpunk dystopian and postapocalyptic science fiction.,RetroFuturism,dg4cckt,1,t5_2repb
