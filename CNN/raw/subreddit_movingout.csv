786678,0,t3_22gabc,I realize this is an old post and I dont have much advice to offer but Im in a similar situation. I might take a job on the east coast in which case Id be moving from Arizona with my girlfriend and three cats. We havent done much research yet so Id be interested to know what you end up doing and how it works out.From the bit of research Ive done it seems like it might be cheaper to get the car shipped than it would be to drive especially when you add in the cost of hotels and meals. Of course this depends on how cheap youd be able to book flights. The bigger issue however is the cats. I think it would be easier on them to do one day of uncomfortable travel by plane as opposed to  days of uncomfortable travel by car. Plus we wouldnt have to deal with cat piss in the car and finding places to stay that would allow them. I briefly looked into Greyhound shipping a while ago. It seem to remember that you can only ship boxes under a certain size? Since we have some bigger items wed want to move wed probably have to get a Uhaulshipping containermovers etc so thered be no point using the Greyhound shipping as well.Obviously you know your situation better than I do but if its between a Uhaul and a shipping container the latter seems like your better option. Gas will very expensive for a Uhaul towing a car across the country and it would add a lot of extra hassle to an already stressful move. Good luck and let us know how it goes!,movingout,cgtp6u2,1,t5_2skoz
