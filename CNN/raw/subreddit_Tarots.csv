981136,0,t1_chfssd5,Thanks for the tips!Im not sure Im comfortable praying to Gods or goddesses yet. I consider myself agnostic. Actually when Im delusional I have been twice in  years I tend to think God is talking to me. I dont hear the voice but I see signs in mundane things like TV shows and I misinterpret reality.  Anyway  I feel like a walking contradiction as a non believer who is studying tarot. I think I believe in something maybe but Im not sure what it is.  Ive got a strong intuition though and have had two psychic like experiences.  Once I felt a sudden pain and I just KNEW something had happened to my boyfriend now husband that he had been hurt somehow. Turns out he went to the hospital at that time.  Another time I woke up from a dream crying and knew an ex of mine was going to kill himself. I called his home his parents answered they wouldnt let me talk to him but they told him I called.  I got a call a couple months later from him saying that he was going to kill himself but he remembered my call and decided not to. He took it as a sign from god. Ive had a few other uncanny incidences but those two I cant explain.This is unrealated to your post I know but experiences like these in part make me drawn to tarot and magic and all that despite being agnostic.,Tarots,chftaiv,1,t5_31o5c
1002055,0,t3_25i02a,In my opinion there is almost no such thing as a junk read but rather simple ignorance or lack of Understanding on behalf of the operator.This is much like playing card games using the standard card deck which is merely an emaciated Tarot... where the cards are shuffled for play.  They are not shuffled inasmuch as the players are simply ignorant Fools...,Tarots,chi6wrd,2,t5_31o5c
1024483,0,t3_25onu2,Im still trying to figure this out myself. Usually I read them as ways of being or becoming or the way a situation is being handled. But every now and again a reading is full of them and its really hard to make out who is who and then reversals come into question when reading with a deck geared for it.Usually if a spread is full ofem then I generally think theyre in reference to lots of people being involved in the situation and then it is usually up to the querent after giving some explanation of their characteristics to identify them and then I help the querent organize their relationship and see their place in the context of the story.,Tarots,chkqnta,1,t5_31o5c
1190289,0,t1_ci2sh3v,When I say debts its more of a obligation debt not a how much do I owe. If you want to get technical you owe your life.  As my tradition teaches we borrow the world from our children and our lives from our ancestors. But what you can do is make an effort to commune with your gods. Specifically offer your work to them  if you have a connection to a goddess of the hearth do the house cleaning in her honor  make a point of telling her pray while you work and make sure you do a good job. But you know even if its not a goddess of the hearth  everything you do can be offered to anyone. Just because they have a sphere of influence doesnt mean that other situations are irrelevant to them. There is some bit of Ares in any act and some bit of Aphrodite and so on. Buying groceries can be sacred if you make a point of making it so. Thats the simplest most tsraight forward way of recognizing your debts  make every action an expression of gratitude.And yes I definitely get a positive vibe  things should turn around next month nd month with continued improvement for another month. More work this month  do ALL kinds of work. Do whatever you can physically but regular prayer  offerings  and rites to honor those close to you are definitely a good idea. Good luck!,Tarots,ci3iyho,1,t5_31o5c

10947355,0,t1_de8ifqr,Well...the first deck I learned to use was the Thoth. Its still my favorite years later and part of what makes the deck so enduring for me is the artwork. As soon as I first saw the Prince of Cups back when I was given the Thoth I felt a deep connection with him. The way hes looking so intently into the cup as if hes hoping to find answers inside it...plus I love all the steam and water droplets surrounding him and the colors are beautiful too. So yeah I resonated with the artwork initiallyplus I already knew that I am a Water type through and throughand then the more I read about the the Prince of Cups the more I realized how much he represents me. Its been years since I started practicing tarot and the Prince of Cups is still my personal card no question about that. ,Tarots,de954pp,1,t5_31o5c
11133860,0,t1_deks473,Hi Graidan sorry for having you wait so long I hadnt realized you had replied here.To simplify the reading Ive divided it in different questions please find them here below.Do you have all the skills to make the blog succeed?TEN OF CUPSThis card is one of the cards that most represents happiness and joy in the tarot. Cups are the suit of emotions. This card tells me that you will be more than fine and that the real driver of success for your blog is going to be your passion for the topics you want to talk about and your emotional engagement on the project. So dont worry if your skills still need to improve it will come with time.What do you have to know about your writing skills KNIGHT OF PENTACLESI get the feeling that at times writing might feel like a chore something you dont particularly enjoy or that you are not confident with. My advice is to keep it simple and not to give up if you feel you are not perfect. When you feel demotivated think upon the fact that writing is a tool for you to be able to express yourself through your new project. Its a tool to engage with your passions. Write with your heart and you wont go wrong.What do you have to know about Aspergers affecting your work?FOUR OF PENTACLESThis card tells me two things. One that planning ahead can help you with the job especially with your confidence. Read a lot of other blogs and try to copy some of the sentences if they have the tone you want to achieve. Second that you shouldnt overthink about the proper tone. I am not very familiar with Aspergers so I hope what I say makes sense but try to be yourself and dont worry too much about requirements that you are setting up by yourself. The only proper tone is your tone. And maybe it could become your point of strength? maybe connecting on your themes and passion with other people with Aspergers?Is the blog going to be successful in the long run?KNIGHT OF WANDSIt will if youll put determination. Dont start with s of ideas and then get overwhelmed and stop writing. Dont set goals too high so that you will feel demotivated. Start simple small and commit to making this blog growing slowly but steady I have no doubts that youll have the success you deserve!I hope this is clear sorry English is my second language and Id be happy to receive a feedback from you.Love Alessandra,Tarots,deu0gni,2,t5_31o5c
