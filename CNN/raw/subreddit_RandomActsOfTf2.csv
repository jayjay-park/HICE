A few months after I got the unu I got bored of it and wanted steam funds. This ended with me getting scammed. Time went by and I got over my loss. The unusual was only about  keys.A year and a half after I lost the unusual I managed to track it down due to a friend of me having premium bp.tf.

8414436,0,t3_4uulrg,Silver MK. II as my  option and Carbonado MK. I as my  option.I main Medic so I can be credit to team. How many times have you played in a team without a Medic? Thats why I decided to main Medic. Its also incredibly pleasing to see the other team losing because I went Medic and they have a gibusmedic whats even more pleasing is charging with a powerclass into a triple sentry nest with uber and just destroying all the other teams work completely. There are also these nice moments when a Spy or a Demoknight decides to engage in melee combat only to get my charge filled and thus the objective fulfilled as I pop it soon after to destroy defenses or repulse an attack. Another pleasing experience is firing random XBow shots and killing someone or airshotting that airborne Soldier with  health just to watch him utterly confused after landing like what happened why am I alive? Or perhaps seeing a v fight happening far away and just spamming XBow syringes at it which either heal my teammate or kill the enemy either way its an incredibly helpful weapon. Also fun is uberchaining its always very funny to see the enemy backpedaling away as a bloodied ubered maniac runs towards him. ,RandomActsOfTf2,d5tcjhe,2,t5_2waqb
