2907345,0,t1_cnog195,Most of you guys know I work for Shebeen. Ive already been really upset with how people have been talking without thinking about how it would affect the people who love what theyre doing here and have built a family and gained lots of friendships and enjoyed way too much beer sometimes at Shebeen. I started volunteering the day they opened while I was working full time in construction. A while down the road I was sick of my job yearround outdoors with unsteady hours and zero benefits. Being in a rut Rich took a risk and hired me over someone with more managerial experience just out of my dedication. I do what I can for the brewery. I know everyone thinks of Rich as crazy and he is but let me put a few things onto the internets for everyone to read. He is not a bad person. He is the owner. He works full time for another company to pay the bills and typically helps close up shop at the brewery every night squeezing all of his free time aside from some of his daughters ball games into the brewery. He is a family man and does not live in the Wolcott area. Most of the recipes are his own. We have friends and volunteers brew on the bbl system for specialty beers on tap. Our head brewer Justin a chemist has been doing much better on the bbl system. If you think Cannoli Beer is gimmicky youre welcome to your opinion. One of our coowners was joking around one day calling his son Cannoli Boy when Rich had the idea. A recipe was made Rich brewed it and the recipe has been mostly unchanged since its conception. When that beer isnt on tap I have a lot of unhappy people in the taproom. Men women selfproclaimed beer snobs Im not a fan of that term all unhappy. So we make more. We have had issues with quality control and are working to remediate. We offer full refunds or replacement for any of our beers that have had issues. Were sorry for that. Although we ask folks to bring in clean growlers all the time it isnt always the case hence the diatribe on growler sanitation you may have heard about on a previous thread. I was there during the Republican American interview and Richs words were incorrectly paraphrased. There was a push on CT Beer Trail for all bars and restaurants with a good amount of lines to put at least a couple local beers on. He was trying to emphasize that. With so many breweries trying to get on lines its difficult. Not every bar favors rotating local lines. Hes probably going to be bummed I posted this but its getting really lame with all the bashing and its really taking the wind out of my sails. I just want to say thank you for everyone who stops in for a flight everyone in the industry making me feel like part of your crazy family and thank you for sharing my passion for beer. I dont believe Ive ever made anyone upset and this isnt meant for a pity party but thanks to those who stick with us. Were all only human. Cheers!MEdit I just want to add that we all like to jump to conclusions and say whatever we want on social media. Im allowed an opinion but to go out of your way to be nasty about someone and target them on blogs threads etc? Rich has made amends for his untappd comments about gbot. Why cant anyone else make good on comments that are borderline bullying about a person they dont even know? Im just defending someone thats only human just like you. Id like to think that everyone would do this for their friends. ,ctbeer,cnyklsi,-1,t5_2znz3

3260330,0,t3_2xep9f,Dont sleep on the brewpubs. City Steam and Willibrew are OGs on the craft scene. Theyve been putting out quality beer for as long as most of the other breweries in the state combined. They have very good food and two of the coolest buildings in the state. Willibrew is in a  yr old post office and has been integrated beautifully into the existing facades. They also have guest taps usually featuring other CT breweries.  You can get growlers to go and sit out on their patio and listen to live music in the summer.City Steam is smack in the heart of downtown Hartford in a huge funky old building from the th century The bar is beautiful and the food is always good.  In the basement of the brewery is Brew HaHa Comedy Club which is a fun time too. You can buy growlers to go during regular package store hours not the same as the restaurants hours and they sometimes have limited release bombers and  packs of their beer contract brewed at Hooker.Also to add to the other commenters OEC Beerd and NEBCo are my favorites. And I have a special place in my heart for Relic and Firefly as well.,ctbeer,cozy0eo,1,t5_2znz3

3915626,0,t3_35aahq,I should totally ignore this thread but I cant.  As some of you know I take my sons everywhere. Its what I do.  I take them to quiet art galleries uppity wineries boring history museums on long hikes long car trips all sorts of restaurants and yes to breweries. Back when I started writing about all the stuff in CT we had Hooker Cavalry Olde Burnside Cottrell and NEBCO.   Hooker sort of had a sort of tasting room but the other  absolutely did not.  I took my kid to them. we were alone there with Kurt Mike Jason Charlie and MattRob from their respective breweries.  Having a kid along was only notable bc he played with the brewery dogs.  I was giving my wife a break doing something I liked and getting to know some good people I remain friends with today.Things have changed quite a bit.  Im no longer the only person there when I visit breweries and we now have tap rooms and tasting rooms and bottle releases and wait times and lines all sorts of stuff like that.  But I have two sons now.  And Im still friends with many of the brewers and owners several of which have kids now too.  Bringing my sons to breweries is not ideal I know that.  But I will also continue to do so though less and less these days.  I will of course immediately leave if they become PIAs and Ill certainly apologize to anyone whom they bother and if the situation warrants Id buy them a beer.  Only one brewery disallows under s in CT Two Roads and they have their valid reasons for doing so.   And yes Ive had to leave prematurely a couple times.  Just like Ive had to at the grocery store and the playground and the haircut place with them.  It happens anywhere once in a while.  So be it  Im giving my wife a break andor an opportunity to get shit done on her own.  I get to take my boys hiking and maybe to lunch and ice cream and maybe also to a farflung brewery for me.  I wont bring them anywhere at any time that ever involves a wait or a large crowd. So you see People Without Kids those of us who do it hopefullyusually have our rules that we abide by.  I hate annoying people and work very hard at raising kids who dont do it.  of the time they are at a brewery you wouldnt even notice them as they are generally quiet and respectful.  But really if their mere presence annoys you then thats on you.  ,ctbeer,cr2m850,16,t5_2znz3

I hope these guys are successful seem like genuine and nice people.  I still dont know what theyre really about I feel like every brewery should have a more definitive mission statement instead of... we just want to make consistent beer.  That is the  goal for every brewery. I didnt get any kind of vibe as to what types of beers theyre really into what they like themselves.  I got little sense of passion from them for styles.Lastly they dont want to focus on self promotion... I think this is a weird stance as every business needs marketing to some extent.  The part of the state they are in I think will provide a challenge and promotion and spotlight will be key to have people travel to try their beer. Just thoughts.  ,ctbeer,csatrqy,6,t5_2znz3
