839539,0,t3_23pxql,It largely depends on wing. My experiences involve a lot of yelling hurrying and fun. Encampments even change year to year so not every one is an exact copy of the previous one so that everybody has a unique experience. Dont worry about any horror stories you may have heard most are exaggerated and meant to make the new guys nervous. probably the only bad thing about encampment is if you get homesick easily.,civilairpatrol,cgzpiac,1,t5_2sv2k

1579048,0,t3_2bk5uy,Looks like code of some sort. Along with some kind of diagram maybe a map. I can make out the word alone it seems to be using normal letters that follow some pattern of being mirrored upside down or plain. Also some characters I have seen before but I cant recall where.,civilairpatrol,cje7n6t,1,t5_2sv2k

3528658,0,t3_2v27xn,My experiences at various activities Aggie JCAP that involved Sea Cadets CAP Young Marines and JRTOC cadets from all branches all were good people about  cadets total attended but then again that was in Eastern Texas so I cant account for anywhere else. Sea Cadets I would consider the most hard core in terms of their dedication to the program and how much it required of the cadet. We dont really hate them. Its more of a camaraderie thing than anything else. We give them shit and they the same about us. But its all in good fun.,civilairpatrol,cpuhp02,1,t5_2sv2k
4730826,0,t1_ctqsbcg,Now that sounds fun! How did you like it? First time in a helicopter? The only helis I see are from the Air Force at my home squadron on ocassions. Saw one at the airport we were staffing too. Touched down right next to the radio table and blew all the logs around.Also from where did the CA wing get those?!,civilairpatrol,ctqv274,2,t5_2sv2k
5671994,0,t3_3ssx16,You can log onto EServices and look around there is a place to print off a temporary CAPID. You can also order a new one for about  I believe. Something that helps me not lose my stuff is that I keep it in the same spot all the time. I always keep my wallet on my dresser if it isnt in my pocket and I always keep my CAPID in the same slit thing in my wallet. The repetition and muscle memory of doing so helps wonders and doesnt leave me scrambling around last mi ute looking for stuff.,civilairpatrol,cx060r6,6,t5_2sv2k

8320647,0,t1_d5drybt,Knowing Mr Caldwell he really knows his shit. He is a current CAP CAPT CCol and in the natl guard. It is absolutely disgusting to hear uDiverDN say Color between the lines. You are the reason why Natl wants to keep us distinct. This is why enlisted folk hate officers and people CAP kids who think they are. Check yourself.,civilairpatrol,d5hmxvf,-1,t5_2sv2k
