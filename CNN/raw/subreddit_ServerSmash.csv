1131587,0,t1_chwc867,You also cant be sure of how big that imbalance was. Given our WG support and reserves Miller might well have had less than  guys missing maybe even less.,ServerSmash,chwwvxl,1,t5_31fbj
1140947,0,t3_2759as,I think Im fairly neutral when Miller is not playing. With regards to cocasters Ive asked people such as KidRiot Luperza Klyka as well as some of the PSpickup team to casthelp with me.More than willing to have extra help in the casting information on the server in question force composition participants etc. Useful facts. Also extra helpers who can be boots on the ground to give us info.We have very limited number of observer cameras which to be fair Ive stolen and SOE are super cautiousreluctant to make more of them available to the public so as I said extra people lets call them War Correspondents is a fun idea.Final note always willing to take productive feedback onboard. INIcast is a man Production ie me and Im always looking to improve the viewers experience. Give me better Camera noaw plz Higby,ServerSmash,chxyu3l,6,t5_31fbj

1220276,0,t1_ci6mqpx,Fun fact  took miller less than  minutes to create an outfit and assign each outfit leader with OL invite privileges. Not so hard as people think... Then again we did it with the name in convention so we knew which outfit tags on end of names were millerites and we were all in the warpgate stood in outfit circles.,ServerSmash,ci6wdw5,3,t5_31fbj

1289258,0,t1_cienid9,gt  that it would be Emeraldno. they knew it wasnt likely that SOE would agree to Emerald. they knew SOE wanted to name the server after the winner. but they agreed they would try to convince SOE and SS to name it Emerald. thats not outright deciding the result of the match and making it pointless.,ServerSmash,cienpee,2,t5_31fbj

1505664,0,t1_cj4c2b9,gtMiller handed Cobalt a free win just like Woodman handed Miller a free win which is why I intentionally dont say Hey look I led a server smash to victory because the victory means nothing if the opposition is bad. Miller in the Cobalt match was awful so its not exactly something to gloat about or put on your resume. Woodman was not as awful but still made so many mistakes that I dont intend to put it on my resume. If you want to play the resume game I led a server smash on hossin what did you lead on hossin? Lets not go down that lane...Miller had all their best turn up the commander was experienced there was a decent level of force organisation you only had something like  less pilots than you had planned for. So what? You all played bad individually? Is that all Miller did wrong besides bringing one less air squad? Well it doesnt matter to me but Miller never really learned the lessons from that match in all the talk I saw. gtThat is terribly wrong. More lanes to attack means that if you attack you leave yourself open on more bases so the more connections there are to the enemy the more careful and defensive you have to play because each attack means that the enemy gets one more base to attack you at.Thank god we can attack that defensible choke point said no one ever. I think at this point were wasting our time suffice to say if you dont see how how having multiple options to attack your enemy is better than having less options youre stuck in some beta level zerg strategy mindset gl with that.Even if we assume your view is correct the Westernm WG is pretty imbalanced as it has more lattice links to defend with LOL. Thus we the fuck anyone thinks about it the lattice equivalency needs to be looked at whether you think this or that the lattice needs to be equal opportunity for attack defense giving each WG advantages and disadvantages.,ServerSmash,cj50c9g,2,t5_31fbj

2330697,0,t1_clzik2b,I understand.  A ton of frustration came from the EmeraldMiller match when you guys were AllCalling every  minutes for people to get off Amerish and even had me tell everyone to get off amerish when people were logging on to the continent and we had no control over it.   During the Finals prep it was you guys allcalling If you need help adding your name to a document please talk to Sgt Mile every  minutes only to realize that action cause the doc to go readonly due to load and having to allcall everyone to close the doc.  That was just fucking stupid and a prime example of what we have problems with.  You may not feel like that stuff is frivolous but most of the Emerald team does.  It wasnt Stop AllCalling.  It was Dont drown out literally everything.  You guys are incredibly excessive about broadcasting to everyone.  I understand certain things need to be allcalled the prep speech I have no problem with... Keep doing that it works well and makes sure everyone is on the same page... Its just the sheer amount of allcalls you guys do add way too much noise to an already chaotic prep time.  There is a solution to this problem but the reaction I got was fuck you we do what we want and that just pisses everyone off that has an issue with what you guys are doing.  ,ServerSmash,clzscjt,4,t5_31fbj
