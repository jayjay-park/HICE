2695513,0,t1_cna6dnq,Just google the particular wood youre interested in and read some fact sheets about it.  Usually they mention if its oily or not.  For oily woods you can wipe them with acetone or seal them with shellac before trying an oil finish.  That usually works for me.  Or just buff them asis and let the natural oils act as the finish maybe buffing with wax after.  ,CustomKnifeMakers,cnaf7yy,1,t5_2vbx0
8368453,0,t3_4u6s9k,Good work!  My only suggestion would be to check up on sanding techniques because though you went to  grit you still had grind lines from about  grit which sort of ruins the rest of the effort above that grit.  Still very nice all around!I like the wooden retention spring design for that wooden scabbard.  What is the function of that very thick piece of leather exactly?,CustomKnifeMakers,d5nlv7d,2,t5_2vbx0

9522122,0,t3_5b6elj,They are very similar though you usually only see  used in long blades like machetes and swords due to its lower carbon content. The .. carbon content range makes excellent spring steel. Once you get above that you start sacrificing springiness for edge retention though a properly heat treated  or  blade can still take alot of abuse before it breaks making them more than adequate for blades under . Anything longer and you may want to use  or . Also  has a higher manganese content than  or  making it alot easier to heat treat and making the internal grain structure finer. The finer grain structure makes the knife tougher and makes it hold an edge better. The heat treating process is pretty much the same for all basic carbon steels and basic alloy steels like      and CrV.When I first started making knives I was using . Then I decided to buy a couple bars of  since its more commonly used. Ive since moved back to  after doing alot of research on them.  is one of the best steels for athome knifemakers and it makes a better knife.,CustomKnifeMakers,d9msxqd,2,t5_2vbx0

The last time dont sand brush with a medium stiffness toothbrush under running water. Immerse in water saturated with baking soda then in neutral water. Just straight acid takes FOREVER to get a decent finish like a couple hours. The oxygen in the hydrogen peroxide helps speed things along. Im experimenting with the ratios between the two but Ive found it works best if you have more HO than acid.,CustomKnifeMakers,dbcb8vr,1,t5_2vbx0
