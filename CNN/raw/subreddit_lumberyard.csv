Ive downloaded the woodland texture pack and while the UI definitely takes some time to get used to Im managing quite well.With that said is there a default forest that you guys can share with us uLumberyardJamie?

9425662,0,t3_59kaeg,Hey MisterToolbox thanks for creating this! I think the setup needs to be amended though because I am unable to join through the provided link. When I follow the link it asks me to log in with my account and when doing that it says the password is incorrect. My password reset email says this You asked us to send you a password reset link for amazonlumberyard.slack.com. However this email address isnt currently associated with that team. ,lumberyard,d9arn5k,1,t5_30yip
