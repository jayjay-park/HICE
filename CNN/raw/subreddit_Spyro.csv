2602780,0,t1_cmy7jcp,As a previous huge skylanders fan the series sells like hotcakes.  billion dollar franchise I believe. HOWEVER the most recent game was a bit of a flop. A lot of people myself included jumped ship. I could see them going the guitar hero route if their next venture two new elements flops which I think it may. As for LoS I enjoyed the story and the gameplay of the rd one. Can you imagine a spyro game thats entirely like that one level in the third one where youre flying around that HUGE valley? Urg... That makes me moist pNow that insomniac is done with sunset overdrive Id love to see them work on a classic spyro game. Hell even a remastered version of the first three would make me a very happy camper.,Spyro,cmybkjx,1,t5_2so24

5907525,0,t3_3w6wy5,I dont think multiple breaths was a good idea. Theyre dragons not wizards. It started the path to TLoS where Spyro is the chosen one and the master of every element. I want a Spyro remake too but I think they should start fresh and only base it off what the original games were like. Simple platforming action. Of course more things would have to be added to the game in order to get sales.,Spyro,cxu0cn2,3,t5_2so24

6579813,0,t3_41l5ug,For me a large part of the appeal is the worldatmosphere. Spyro  does this the best levels are varied but still tightly themed around the current hub world music is awesome level design is solid. All  games have solid gameplay but each game becomes progressively less about building a cohesive world and more about mashing random cool ideas together. Insomniac also likes to use minigames to vary up gameplay later in a series they did the same with Ratchet and Clank P Not the biggest fan of the minigames.,Spyro,czzwn0s,1,t5_2so24
6780070,0,t1_d0km6n5,Okay in my defense the original games also had forced fourth wall breaks involving Moneybags I just might decide to turn you into a blue hedgehog or something. But yeah mostly I just wanted an excuse to poke fun at the other Spyro series.I wasnt thinking of the RoboPirates specifically. I was going more for that generic robotic evil overlord look. But I do really like Rayman  so maybe I copied it subconsciously.,Spyro,d0kszsp,2,t5_2so24

7910592,0,t1_d456id2,Eeyup. Its so stupid when people throw around But its for kids! and But its a kids game! as if it means one they cant tackle any topics even remotely mature and need to have heroic heroes fighting bland onedimensional evilforthelulz villains and two the game needs to be stupidly painfully easy. I may or may not have played Shadow The Hedgehog before I was  and enjoyed it anyway even if the plot was pretty bad. Also One Piece is considered a kids show in Japan and you should see some of the stuff it tackles. ,Spyro,d4584fk,1,t5_2so24
7938542,0,t3_4nz4z4,Really hoping that a Spyro remaster is in the cards now or at some point in the future. Id absolutely pour my money into that Ive been begging for one for years.

11373455,0,t1_dfl1m57,Well the key thing here is that its just an optional challenge mode with a separate save game from any normal gameplay saves.And itd be understood that the reason its a challenge mode in the first place is because of those things and that playing a game in that mode can potentially result in those penalties for losing too many times in it.No ones being forced into that added difficulty mode its just there for anyone who wants it.
