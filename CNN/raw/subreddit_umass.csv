As opposed of course to hitting someone walking to class out of my own negligence because they decided to make a sharp turn into Herter.With an attitude like yours  what with the suggestion that youd like me to get hit by a car  Im not at all surprised that your inclination is to selfishly break the law out of your own perception of safety rather than obey it for the safety of others.Ill be sure to take a selfie on Summer St in Boston while I ride to work this morning bonehead.,umass,cgi0yl3,-2,t5_2qowg

As for skills it heavily depends on your job and what you want to do. My former Army job HAZMAT gave me a ton of certificates that fire departments ate up because they cost a ton of money for them. Supply intelligence mechanical...these jobs all grant civilian certificates. Another great example my wife is a Lab Tech she came out of her Army training with an Associates from George Washington and is nationally certified found a killer job within a month with no other experience than the Reserves theres even a website that lists most of them out thats why she chose her job. Im not sure what you mean by ROTC..theres no need to do that at all its totally unrelated to being a student in the Reserves.So the question is...what do you want to do after college? Why do you want to rack up all that tuition debt to really graduate with nothing more than a degree when you could get started in the Reserves and get a degree with no debt at all...and extra experience and certifications to boot...and a guaranteed paycheck if prospects in the job market are lousy?Thats the question that was posed to me when I was in college and why I joined. If its not for you no worries but...mull it over and even if youd just like to sit down and learn some more Im around campus. ,umass,d8y7ujw,2,t5_2qowg

Ive also seen the opposite end where someone told another person I cant like you because youre not Asian.That being said There are plenty of support groups to fight it.  Racism is not accepted here.

Obviously there are some that dont because they either waited too long or their resume just isnt too impressive. But Id say the majority of people get at least one internship before senior year. Plenty get . A few will have  or more. As far as companies a lot of local companies recruit at UMass. Liberty Mutual Fidelity Amazon Optum Charles River. Facebook and Google recruit at UMass too. Ive known people to get internships at Microsoft as well. Im interning at a company in the mid west this summer so theres no real limit on the companies that you can get internships at except for maybe unicorn companies in California like Uber and Snapchat. Biggest problem Ive seen from CS students here is that some dont apply early enough and they dont apply to enough companies. If you do apply early and to a decent amount I think I applied to  companies and stopped cause I started getting overwhelmed with interviews then getting an internship should be relatively easy here. ,umass,df4xznu,7,t5_2qowg
