A stabilized stone has been imbedded with resin of some sort.It seems ridiculous that companies would dye and stabilize these beautiful stones but generally the material is such low quality it would otherwise be unsellible and would just become waste.,rockhounds,cifnwwa,1,t5_2rbfx

The native Mori tribe has exclusive access to the jade that comes off the rock on the Arahura river. You can not mine it. You have to wait until the river spits out a chunk or boulder and it is harvested. A friend of his has a local lapidary shop where my friend got to cut and polish some jade. She taught the shop owner how to wire wrap gems into pendants and in trade he gave her some pieces of polished jade.

I think I have two of which are both half of one and half of the same. Recovered in Pennsylvania from a very old and deep quarry while hammering out a piece of calcite I wanted to study. I ended up with a chunk of matrix about  long and an inch thick with calcite top bottom and throughout. While studying the sample it broke in half revealing a Chalcopyrite on each side. Ive been wanting to melt it out with acid for years now but was told if I do it will turn blue and be ruined. Would it? Ill try and dig it out of the collection to photograph for the group asap. Ive also found Chalcopyrite from Black Rock Tunnel dump site in Phoenixville PA that exposed itself blue after an acid bath.

It happens when a porous piece of wood gets buried underground and then mineral rich sometimes silica iron oxides or others groundwater runs through the porous wood causing crystal growth in the open spaces.

9263032,0,t1_d8prc2x,Thats great. Knowing the location the rock came from is a big factor in identifying but not . Pyrite can be easy to ID but it also has  known localities on earth so testing is used for positive ID. A few rocks I have come from famous American Poets houses. I have rocks from David Thoreaus house on Walden Pond Robert Frost up in NH and Edgard Allen Poe from NY State they are meaningless but maybe at one point he threw it out of his garden and I picked it up..Lastly I want to be clear about my definition that a collector and a hound are one in the same both collect with passion for beauty history science and love of earth.
