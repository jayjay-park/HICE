10201982,0,t1_dc0bhja,Ive heard of ambiversion before and thats what I consider myself. Definitely need my metime after long periods of social interaction. I attribute that part of me to how I was raised home schooled. But it doesnt change the fact that people are totally my thing. I love everyone and spending time making people happy gets me excited and energized.Synesthesia is a wonderful thing and I was so used to it that I assumed it was something everyone experienced until I learned what it was. Right now one of my favorite sounds is a full B flat chord. It has a really warm golden  brown color and its very comforting. Its also quite masculine. ,ESFP,dc0g9pq,2,t5_2vb68
