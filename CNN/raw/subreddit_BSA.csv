Dont let others who dont understand the true meaning of scouting get you down. Getting Eagle is a huge achievement and one that you fully deserve. There is no reason to give it up after working so hard for it just because you arent confident with your beliefs. No one person or groups of people should have the ability to take away from you the work that youve done for Eagle. As an atheist myself sending in my project proposal next week I  believe that you should get it.

763430,0,t3_22weaf,Alright I was facing the same problem in a very conservative troop and my board of review members asked me about my religious beliefs. They knew for the most part that I wasnt religious but I wasnt loud about it. Heres how I went through itThe scout law says that a scout should be reverent. Youre partially right in your definition of reverent at least by what I was taught. Not sure about what you mean by to people who have earned it though. If a scout is reverent in relation to religion it means that he has deep respect and faith for his beliefs or lackthereof. HOWEVER it also means that he has the same respect for the beliefs of others. As long as you understand the religions of other people and respect their beliefs you are being reverent. During my board of review I presented my twopart view of how a scout should be reverent I had seen it coming a long way off and thought about it beforehand. I didnt have any problems getting through and one of the parents even talked to me afterwards and thanked me for what I had said. If you are an otherwise perfectly moral Eagle Scout candidate and are denied the rank because of your atheism then they are not being reverent to you and you can probably take up legal matters. I dont quite know what your application meant by that statement of an obligation to god mine didnt have anything of the sort. I think it might have something to do with your local council. Id actually appreciate it if youd send an image of that page so I can take a look. Regardless of what happens you earned your Eagle and nothing will change that.

But I see both sides. How do you take out a part of scout law that was in scouting since the beginning people would get so mad hurting the organization even more. There are equally compelling arguments to this debate even more so than the gay issue. There is no easy way out of this either way the organization suffers in some form. Gray area.

Growing community of Eagle Scouts is a very good thing however I contend that this community should be growing with Eagles that served in leadership positions esp SPL ASPL or PL. Now of course there is only one SPL per troop but with there being multiple PL opportunities if you arent elected or selected for those maybe the BoR should refer you back until you take on a leadership role. This will help add some prestige to the rank yet still add to the community of Eagles who end up becoming leaders in their community as well.

6195707,0,t1_cyksf71,On Cinco de Mayo we all eat Mexican food and dance to Mexican music at grand city festivals.In music class my children learn folk dances from the American south and Israel. On St Patricks day we all get to be Irish wear green drink too much pinch each other and eat cabbage. At Christmas time my children learned the dreidel song at school. We put up crche in our home even though our ancestors did not come from Southern Europe. In November there was a potlatch at school with native foods and arts and crafts. You dont have to be a Christian to put up a Christmas tree. You dont have to Jewish to light a menorah. America prides itself on being a melting pot. Cultural appropriation is what we do and I think we are all the better for it. For adopting and adapting bits and pieces of each others cultures.Native American costumes are the most interesting of any period costume Ive ever considered wearing. I dont know why. I think that Native American culture appeals so much to the scouting movement because the scouting movement is so much concerned with camping and being comfortable in the outdoors and native Americans were perhaps the last of the huntergatherer cultures in the world to give up that way of life. Of course there are other huntergatherer cultures that we could admire however the most appropriate shift might be Robin Hood. He was a famous archer so they could continue to call themselves the order of the arrow and he lived in the forest and he was English. ,BSA,cytvwsv,1,t5_2rt4o

6706675,0,t3_47dfvi,Im going through a bit of a similar process with my troop where I had to be a bit more hands on to break some bad patterns and get things on track.  I explained to my SPL what my goals were and why came up with  ideas on what structures might work and then asked him to figure it out from there.  I asked for a rough draft by a certain date and when I reviewed it I had no concerns at all so I praised him and we went with that plan.The Scouts dont get to change the definitions.  We will have patrols and there are definitions of what a patrol is which includes  members.You define the boundaries and the troop functions within that under the SPLs leadership.  You make the rules as needed.So decide on the definitions.  How many active Scouts do you want in each patrol?  What do you want to do with the inactive Scouts?  We put them in a Bigfoot patrol because while sightings have been reported theres no evidence that some of these guys actually exist.  Then do the math that leaves you with X patrols.  Give your SPL guidelines to follow.  We need between X and Y patrols with    active members in each.  Younger Scouts should be in a standalone patrol or however you run that.Have you been the SM long?  Whats your relationship like with these two Scouts?You need to address this insubordination.  Sternly if it was said disrespectfully up to and including removal from office if you have the backing of the committee and feel secure.  Maybe just a conversation with each of them individually maybe a more formal SM conference maybe include their parents as observers but not participants.  If the Scouts and parents cant abide by your rules and your discipline process they can find another troop.What you did was disrespectful and insubordinate.  I will not tolerate that.  You can certainly openly share your thoughts with me but my SPL will be on my team.  If you cant do that then well need to find an SPL who can.  Am I understood?  Yes what?In any case remind your SPL what BP said Scouting is a game for boys under the leadership of boys under the direction of a man.The JASM is entirely out of line he is to function as an ASM and is under your direct command and should have had nothing to do with this.  He should be reminded of his duties.  Do not argue with him about this ignore him since its not any of his business.,BSA,d0d10l9,2,t5_2rt4o

Not all babies will nurse under a cover. Some completely absolutely refuse. Not all moms can use emergency bottles  since some babies refuse bottles altogether and some moms cant go that long without expressing milk  and its even more challenging to find a place to discretely express milk than it is to nurse a baby!For reasons like this there have been laws put into place in most states that allow women to nurse in public  covered or not  in any place theyre legally allowed to be.

11461053,0,t3_63lrna,I will go over these one by one. There are over sixty boys. That size troop becomes difficult for outings and being boyled. As the size increases from  to  you really need an additional layer of boyleaders and additional PLC meeting time to organize. It is less wieldy and the usual adult response is for adults to take on more responsibility instead of having the boy leaders spend twice as much time planning.  For outings it becomes tougher. There are lots of places to take  scouts camping floating swimming or backpacking. Try doing that with  scouts.       Each year all the new scouts are in  patrols and never reorganized. The BSA guidance is that no more than  years age difference is preferred in patrol mates. Usually scouts should be in patrols with other scouts they want to do activities with. I just reorgd my troop and let the boys choose patrols but I did not let the th graders and the high school juniors mix.  If you end up with  new scouts each year it is probably going to be a new patrol each year. But if a scout wants to change patrols and both patrols are OK with it let him.      Patrol leader is a trainonthefly job in most troops. Of course guidance from SM and ASM is usually given along the way using EDGE but it tends to be less formal than that which you describe.      Most scouts make First Class in  months is good. Having too much of an advancement focus in troop meetings is not. Advancement is a Method not an Aim.  We actually have older scout instructors to get the new boys to First Class and  months is an upper limit on any active scout.  A scout who is attentive can do it in .   If a scout does it in  months it was really his dad doing it.  Or else he is starting over age .   We are initiating a new program this year so that scouts who want to do the four hardest Eagle Required will have extra access to MB counselors at troop meetings during summer break. I want to get rid of  year olds who need to do an Eagle Project Personal Fitness and Personal Management!    Waiting two years as a Life Scout is not appropriate at all. It is not BSA guided. It is malintentioned. It is wrong. It adds requirements that do not exist and that practice is officially banned. In practice it is difficult to get a troop leadership to change  much easier to find a different troop. The troop leadership only answers to the Charter Org rep and they tend to be either in cahoots with the Committee Chair or disengaged.  My point is that if you disagree with the application of the Aims and Methods in this troop you should switch rather than fight. Find yourself a new troop. Dont antagonize the existing troop unless safetydiscipline of the boys is a real issue. ,BSA,dfv3pxw,19,t5_2rt4o
11554368,0,t1_dg50xas,But it is a good lesson and that is the point. In small business you often contract to do work and the beneficiary or person who will be cutting you a check asks to change the proposed plan. In commercial real estate it happens so often the proposed changes are budgeted usually too thin. Its a good representation of life and dealing with it is a good lesson. ,BSA,dg5owey,1,t5_2rt4o

11738774,0,t3_67id3u,First removing ANYONE from leadership either SMASM or committee usually causes more problems than it solves. So proceed VERY carefully.    Second all committee members the SM and ASM serve at the pleasure of the Chartered Org Representative. They may be removed without specifying a reason. In many cases the Chartered Org Rep will delegate that authority to the Committee Chair or Committee in general.  But that authority originates at the Chartered Org Rep.   There is no capacity for anyone else DE SE Commissioner etc to remove that committee member unless that person is a demonstrably a bad scouter YPT violations endangering youth through failure to adhere to GTSS etc.    And yes I think you can make a failure to adhere to GTSS adhere but that is more a SMASM issue than a committee member issue. Each SMASM signs on the dotted line that they will obey all the rules of scouting.  Each outing unit leader has an implicit contract with all the parents that they will abide by the GTSS while they oversee someone elses children.  Back to my first point think about this move VERY carefully before executing it. ,BSA,dgqmbw7,11,t5_2rt4o
