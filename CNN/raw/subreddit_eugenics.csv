4426445,0,t1_csogoqk,gt  i want to understand the world in general.Me too but until people can say controversial things without getting fired or punished I dont look at your views as science but more just you preaching your faith.  You dont have good science till you can have free discussion without persecution.If you want to convince people that believe like me spend your energies stopping the persecution of controversial opinion like James Watson.   Youll convince more people that way than pointless link debates.   Because right now I look at your science as more as fishing expeditions defending the faith.  I could be convinced otherwise but that would come with good science.    ,eugenics,cson85e,1,t5_2qw3o

5488394,0,t1_cwd29aj,gt I personally do not believe in the concept of positive eugenicsit already happens there is just a large field untappedfor example we discourage people with the syndrome of down to breed this is an example of eugenics ive never heard anyone disagree with.why future eugenics is necessary DNA mutates at constant rates but due to improved in the medical field people are no longer dying because of them. though that is a good thing that means broken DNA will accumulate coming centuries until everybody is dependent on medicine unless we remove this broken DNA reducing everyones wellbeingeugenics is an future inevitability ,eugenics,cwd6ybi,1,t5_2qw3o

10589524,0,t3_5rilh9,Racial ancestry itself isnt important. Eugenics in the Galtonian sense is about the improvement of stock genetic quality not making racial phenotypes the same as some kind of role model pure northern European. I say this as someone of nearly  Scandinavian ancestry.A population of mixed race people with high intelligence would produce a much better society than one of pure European below average persons would. In the US they do in fact have such a population of Europeans. They live in West Virginia and they arent doing so well. On par with Mexico or so.So cheer up. Whatever population differences may exist they arent very important for individuals. They are mainly important in deciding on social policy. Here I refer to something like affirmative action which is based on the view that African etc. really do have the same intelligence as Europeans and the tests are unfair against them etc. which is just not true.,eugenics,dd887vp,8,t5_2qw3o
