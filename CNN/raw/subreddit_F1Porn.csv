354027,0,t3_1y2s4a,I was at this race and what an emotional roller coaster it was. I remember standing in the rain behind my grandstand in what was once grass that had now turned to mud. My girlfriend standing under the umbrella of a stranger while I was texting my buddy who was watching it live and he kept assuring me that they werent going to stop the entire race. this was a pretty big topic with everyone. We left the grandstand when the lightning started and I remember the guy next to me making some snide remark about how we werent willing to tough it out. Funny how he never came back after the race started up When the rain stopped it became clear that the only people left were the people who loved the sport and not those who came to be fashionable. The TV at my grandstand was water logged working only intermittently. For some reason only one persons radio seemed to be working and he was busy giving us the play by play. Button pits again! Webber passed Schumacher using DRS. The guy who was sitting next to me had seats further back but everyone huddled closer to the action. He spoke not a word of english but when Schumacher passed Massa AND Kobayashi at the same time we both saw it coming ran to the end of our grandstand for a better view then proceeded to high five each other and talk about how awesome that was in our own language.At some point a group of us were chanting anyone but Vettel over and over again. The guy on the radio was telling is Vettel was in trouble and Button was putting the pressure on. No one could believe it with all of his pits. We discussed how Vettel had to make a mistake because the dry line was just too narrow to pull off a pass. I was at turn  and ahead we hear the crowd at turns  erupt. Everyone goes silent. We wait to see what happens. Instead of the customary Redbull driving under the bridge we see Jenson Buttons Mclaren. The entire grandstand lets out deafening cheer with hands in the air. I can only imagine this same wave of emotion pulsing though the rest of the circuit. The fact that both Button and Vettel would have witnessed these reactions as victor and the defeated and how each driver must have felt has just dawned on me.After everything we went through the race certainly delivered. While dont expect every event to be like this but going to any Motorsport event is a must. The people alone are worth it and almost always get some entertainment but occasionally you see something great. Something worth talking about  years afterwards and the  Canadian Grand Prix is that for me. I havent gone since due to family events selfish bastards getting married on my race weekend but Ive already bought tickets this year so if anything comes up too bad Im going!,F1Porn,cfhgmyu,2,t5_2uz6w

Interestingly only Grosjean Hulkenberg and Kobayashi seem to have personal sponsors in their overalls. Romain has Total and Goodwill Hulkenberg wears a Dekra hat and Kobayashi has AREN.JP written on his chest.Edit Actually it looks like Alonso has something on his biceps as does Sutil. Gutierrez has OMP on his belt and Marussia drivers have different sponsors on their chests. So in the end plenty of personal sponsors on the grid.,F1Porn,cg479op,11,t5_2uz6w

948793,0,t1_chc2ing,They probably wanted more rear downforce. The way I see it if the front wing is close to the ground it uses up much of the clean air. Instead they are allowing more clean flow under the car for less drag andor a more heavily rearweighted aero balance. This was just after the turbo era but they still had a lot of aurally delicious V power to control.Also it just looks straight up awesome.,F1Porn,chc4vrk,2,t5_2uz6w

3479942,0,t1_cpok5ua,People have their opinions but what I think hes referring to is the FIAs push for safety. Since  when Senna and Ratzenberger died at Imola weve seen the FIA impose things from pit lane speed limits to chicanes to slow the cars to rigorous crash testing. All things which are good for safety reasons but which have led to asepticized racing.Its not safetyrelated but in recent years things have gotten even less heroic with the advent of really complex hybrid cars. Super complex engines mean that only the really well funded teams have a shot at victory and even then if a team is too far back it will never catch up in terms of development. This means that you always see the same cars in the same order.I could go on and on about engine regulations shty tire performance and ineffective costcutting measures but I have job to get back to!,F1Porn,cpoxstb,4,t5_2uz6w
