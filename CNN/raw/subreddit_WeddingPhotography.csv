1615668,0,t1_cjirshz,Sometimes clients want the ease and assurance of knowing they will get good print quality. You are the professional and they want your guidance and help as much as possible and dont want to get cast off to someone else. I calibrate my monitors with MillersMpix and sell through zenfolio. I can tell my clients with absolute certainty that they will get color and print quality as I intended. I can check the crop and either allow or skip color correction for any photos they buy. If they take my images to walmart or even a decent online place the images will get corrected and who knows what they will look like. You dont have to charge  for an x if you dont want to I think I charge about . I charge very reasonable rates and people love the service and assurance of quality. They are always free to print elsewhere but would much rather spend a few extra bucks for prints through my zenfolio gallery than roll the dice with some other service.

1714851,0,t3_2e1zzb,The number one thing to remember is that your photographer is the vendor whos going to be with you pretty much the entire day. You need to pick someone who you can stand to hang out with for the entire day.Aside from being a cool person to hang with there are a few things that can usually suss out a technically competent photographer. Look for a variety of real wedding locales. Indoors outdoors moonlight high noon. Someone technically versed can work with all of the above. Someone less experienced might struggle or not show some of the more technically difficult situations to work such as high noon or dark interiors.. Look for more real weddings fewer styled shoots. Styled shoots are  controlled situations which dont have much bearing on actually working a wedding day.. Cheaper doesnt mean worse but expensive doesnt always mean better.

If you can edit a wedding in  day  I dont see what the logic is to wait weeks to start editing.  Getting the photos to the couple fast will increase that wow factor  and create happy customers.

2770014,0,t3_2rptnp,Hi! First poster and lurker here!A bit of introduction. I am currently in my last year of high school and I am working parttime for my brother as a secondary shooter. He works as a wedding photographer and digital producer and has recently involved me as a secondary shootersetup guy. I have attended three weddings in the past and Im starting to build up knowledge and experience. I am actively looking to improve my shots and having this subreddits experienced and professional photographers advice and feedback would be very helpful in further learning. I am open to criticism and feedback as I have a wedding scheduled this saturday.Here are some of my work  The photos vary from fully edited to slightly toned to unedited. I am still a novice at editing and although I think they are fine I know that they are very flawed in both shooting and editing. If anyone can give me tips on editing andor shooting that would be swell.The camera I am using is a Canon EOS ti. I would love to upgrade to a better camera in the near future but I am unfamiliar of which camera to choose. Which one is the best one for wedding photography and the best bang for my buck. What cameralense are used by wedding photographers? My budget is from  as a reference point. I am currently a photographer for my schools yearbook as well as journalist. I want to be able to improve myself further more and I believe that exposing myself to more photographyrelated things would help me learn. I am in Toronto and I can work as a secondary shooter for free. I want to participate in as many weddings possible to build a portfolio and experience. If anyone is interested please PM me for further details.Sorry for the bad spacing and thanks in advance!,WeddingPhotography,cnixv0w,3,t5_2rdee

From my  hour coverage I delivered  shots that I was reasonably happy with I rated about half of these again  stars meaning they contributed to the story and were good enough for the album. I took over  so I know obviously it is possible to take that many shots but to get that many keepers even if you have a nd shooter I would expect higher quality more than a vast increase in the quantity of shots.

3994135,0,t3_366zvp,When I first got started in wedding photography I had a very limited portfolio mostly travelpersonal photography projects and no leads at all. I ran a competition to give away a free wedding and engagement shoot. The main reason I did this was to be able to have a full wedding in my portfolio that was my target styledemographic etc... I promoted the competition across all social media and via facebook ads. All entrants were asked to tell me more about themselves their style of wedding venue etc... and I selected the couple who was having the kind of wedding I was most interested in shooting in the future. All other the runners up who were also my target demographic were also offered a free engagement shoot to help build up my portfolio and some even ended up booking me at full rates for their actual wedding day. The wedding we shot for the giveaway ended up being our main marketing source initially and ended up in a wedding magazine and in one of the most popular local wedding blogs which further helped build our brand. We also submitted some of the other engagement shoots to blogs to help build our web presence. Wedding blog features and magazine features have been the most impactful source of marketing for me. Free or discounted shoots are sometimes necessary when youre initially building your portfolio but always make sure that youre doing it strategically rather than any person that will take you up on it. Tagging your clients on facebook images which they are ok with your sharing also helps with getting some traction with your branding. Hope that helps! Good luck with your photography business. ,WeddingPhotography,crbkc7n,2,t5_2rdee

Now  is a more normal average but we have those  hour days that will creep higher in picture count. There are so many things going on throughout the day that the last thing Im worried about is how many pictures we are taking. We are the photographers... Our job is to photgraph the entire day start to finish. We do not stop snapping until we walk away and we want to ensure we capture every single special moment from that day. You just have to have the ability to look at  of the pictures and say nope... Doesnt meet my standards. We have the beautiful ability to take a tiny piece of plastic insert it into our cameras and take  images on that piece of plastic! Culling is part of our job and for me one of the easiest parts so the last thing I am worried about is how many images Im accumulating throughout the day...

6315650,0,t3_42430j,IANAL but how did they let you know they cancelled the wedding? Did they let you know via a phone call text message or email? As long as you have something in writing from them that you can always reference you should be okay. A phone call is really hard to verify what was said since there is no recording of it.I personally require in my contract the following Cancellation If for any reason Client cancels this contract before the wedding date Photographer will keep the retainer. Cancellation must be made in writing signed by the contracted party and sent via Certified Mail by the United States Post Office. If Client fails to supply written cancellation as specified before the wedding date or cancels within  days of the wedding date Client shall be required to pay the full balance due.This covers my butt because they have to send it via certified mail which records when they send the letter and when the letter is recieved so if they send it a week before the wedding and try to claim the sent it a month before their claim holds no weight because the proof is right there.Other than that I am sorry to hear that it was cancelled for your end as well as theirs.In this situation the advice I can offer you is to have them write you an email at the least saying that the wedding for this weekendday of their wedding is cancelled andor for them to also if possible write a handwritten note legible stating that the wedding is cancelled sign it scan it in and email it to you as well.,WeddingPhotography,cz7ipq2,3,t5_2rdee

However when I second shoot for weddings my primary always tells me to expose for skin or the dress. I guess part of the difference is how much editing needs to be done after the fact.

Also if its really dark and hard to autofocus you can throw it into live view and manual focus with the focus peaking dots.

Im learning that maybe these leads arent my ideal clients. Ill be going back to the free account at the end of the year. Free accounts arent listed in their online directory so unless they search for your specific business name you wont show up in their search results for your area wedding photographers. With that said free accounts are great for getting reviews. Something else Ive noticed is Ill go weeks and weeks without getting any new leads from weddingwire then Ill receive a call from their rep asking how things are going and I always inevitably mention the leads are light then miraculously Ill receive  new leads the same day my Rep called none of which I ever hear back from once I respond to them.

I have a bunch of the first dance so Ill go over those as well there will be more to deliver. Also just sold off my x so I can upgrade to the s or t for the better low light focus.

In fact Tammy is at the end of the line.  Sometimes time is running out and the bride has to say Sorry Tammy you have to do your own hair and makeup and Tammy makes sure to display a Full Resting Bitch Face in every photo thereafter.  If someone makes the fatal mistake of saying Would anyone else like to say anything? after the toasts or as they say here in the Bible Belt Does anyone else have something on their heart? Tammy will jump to gush over how close she and the bride are and how she looooves her like a sister and she understands why politics made the bride choose Shelly as the Maid of Honor.I personally loathe when wedding guests  not the couple not the couples family not even someone in the bridal party  will come up to me GRAB my arm and tell me about the shot I am missing.  Look thats a good shot over there!  And then points to something banal and in shitty light.  I would like to ask them if they have also made a trip to the kitchen to give the catering staff tips on how to cook salmon but I am trying to discipline myself to just smile and say Let me get to this first . . . and walk off or grab a shot knowing that will be among the hundreds I cull.Best moment  shooting the cake cutting.

9990999,0,t1_db9bo0d,Not always.  We shoot weddings with two D MkIII a backup D Lii Lii  .Lii IS three exrt etc all good kit that we know how to use fairly well and like to think our coverage is considered professional.  For all day two shooter coverage we are only  more than a  locals actually with various levels of suck local momtographer who is shooting weddings alone natural light thats not a subgenre of photography lol with I shit you not a Canon T and  EFS variable aperture kit lens on auto in JPG with white vignettes and poorly done selective colour. I checked the EXIF. One was shooting a friggin powershot as her main body.  It makes me crazy thinking that these clients and the momtog risk their biggest day to save a few hundred dollars. Experience and personality go a long way but these momtogs dont even have a contingency plan for broken equipment.  Pretty hard to be a photographer without a camera.  I also see exactly zero reception or indoor ceremony photos from these types surely because they are terrible even at web sizes. And all to save a bit on a one time cost.  Im sure we are undercutting ourselves on price but it is getting us jobs and building our portfolio and experience while hopefully delivering quality memories.  Even without pro equipment theres no way these momtogs are making more than minimum wage for what they are charging in my area after factoring in timeexpenses.  then again when you are shooting jpg and not levelling horizons what editing is there?.  ,WeddingPhotography,db9usc2,2,t5_2rdee

People will argue that but from the one pod I was in the comments were no better then the random spam ones that I would receive. Ideally I would like to start a pod with friends I know in person.

10533380,0,t3_5qtnzb,I have been using LED panels a lot more these days for various things and really finding them invaluable. Had a double header of night weddings this weekend. Last night we had a weddding that was supposed to start min before sunset and ended up start about min before sunset at an outdoor venue with zero lights. It was supposed to be a min ceremony but I had suspicions it would be like min and I ended up being totally right. I set up my led panels and focused them and then used the remote to slowly dial them up as we went through blue hour into pitch black. Totally saved my butt as well as the entire wedding experience for the wedding guests and couple.But I have also learned that using the LEDs for formats tend to attract people like moths since I usually have a nice backdrop positioned. It gets a bit tough holding bystanders back away from my setup. ,WeddingPhotography,dd22phd,8,t5_2rdee

Id like to get out there more but am struggling on how to do that. Any way these are photos from a wedding that I was the lead for in December.  Bride was fully aware of experience and willing to give me a shot. She was happy with the photos. Myself on the other hand know I could do much better. Im happy with some and not some with others.

11037599,0,t3_5xk7k2,Weve shot a couple of destination weddings! Heres what weve learned.There are pros and cons to hiring a photographer local to the city youre traveling to. A local photographer would be familiar with portrait locations in the area. Youd also probably save a bit of money. However it can sometimes be difficult to find a local photographer who matches the youre looking for. Other regions of the world can have pretty dramatic differences in wedding photography styles. It can be easier to work with a photographer whos from where youre from as well.Doing it only symbolically is a great decision! Getting legally married in another country can be incredibly complicated.If youre hiring a photographer to travel with you to Paris heres some things to keep in mind Make sure to get there a couple days early along with your photographer so you can meet and talk about scouting locations for photos. Make sure your venue is alright with you hiring a foreign photographer. They should have it with them in case customs asks when they arrive in Paris. Since theyd need a work visa to shoot your wedding they should pose as a cameracrazy old friend whos attending as a guest.,WeddingPhotography,dej3cbf,3,t5_2rdee
