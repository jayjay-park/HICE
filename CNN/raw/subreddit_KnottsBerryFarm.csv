11220443,0,t1_df3awhb,I was thinking something like Pulsar It would be a fantastic fit at the park being a good successor to both Boomerang forwards amp backwards and Perilous Plunge large water ride with airtime. The manufacturer of Pulsar also built Sierra Sidewinder and Coast Rider so the park has a good history with them. Also the location of the Boardwalk area couldnt be better.,KnottsBerryFarm,df3tn8b,3,t5_2wfms
