298295,0,t3_1xcrdj,A good article from the Forest Park News about the survey here  It really is a shame that they paid someone to put together a simple surveymonkey survey that appears to just be off the top of someones head.  But still good to have something out there.  ,NearWestSuburbs,cfbon4w,2,t5_2xtbb

1704737,0,t3_2dx1d1,my favorite place is my yardporch. You should explore the south side. We love having Eds Way closeby. Amelias is good food. Nothing on Mad St. compares to the Golden Steer. Theres usually something happening at the Park...Least favorite part?  DesPlaines,NearWestSuburbs,cju1lj3,2,t5_2xtbb

9133045,0,t3_554yw4,I was in same situation moving to forest park and wanted to rid myself of Comcast.once I was on phone to cancel Comcast they bent over backwards to keep me from quitting. I played hardball and they kept capitulating.  now I get fast and cheap internet through Comcast. Im actually quite thrilled with the deal they gave me.  Mbs for mo and I didnt have to bundle with tv or phone. ,NearWestSuburbs,d89ogs4,2,t5_2xtbb
10991309,0,t1_dedsyig,time will tell.  I feel like city gaming subreddits are small in impact and userbase. Of course Chicago is not a city its a nation. It does have a city gaming subreddit. Where does this leave smaller cities in Illinois. I feel like the chicago subreddit should be more successful I suspect they have trouble promoting it. This is because when I promote this subreddit on a gaming reddit or other site. I advertise  different allied state subreddits this  covers so many people the mods do not remove it. If i just said hey gamers in Chicago come check out this subreddit it applies to so few people it might get removed. I believe that southern illinois gamer subreddit would be even smaller because who identifies as that people think of states and cities. Hopefully we can eventually get competition going between the different states in the alliance using state pride as a tool to hype up the participants.If you are looking for someone in your town or neighborhood I think you should use this subreddit and rIllinoisGamers . Thats covering all your bases.TLDR its a matter of opinion but mine is that state subreddits are the perfect size.  City subreddits are too small and a Midwest Gamers subreddit is too big. Regional Subreddits are too obscure.,NearWestSuburbs,dedtw55,1,t5_2xtbb
