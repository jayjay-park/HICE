6991054,0,t1_d18ewm4,Okay we are beyond my realm of expertise here and Ive already had to turn to Google to confirm my interpretation of what you said but here goes.The main body of the boot appears to be stitched to the midsole which in turn was glued to the outsole. Im basing this on the lack of any visible stitching on the bottom of the outsole Im wearing a pair of boots that does have some stitching visible on the bottom so I do have some clue of what to look for and the lack of a diagonal channel like you asked about that is at least as far as I can determine.I do not think the sole was glued to the boot. Being a carpenter I do know something about glue joints. It appears that I somehow managed to shear through the stitching there is thread left in the leather and the rubber. I would not expect that could have easily happened with glue reinforcing the joint. However come to think of it that does not rule out an inadequate or somehow damaged glue joint. Regardless there is glue there now though not the correct kind. I needed them to get me through a few more hours after this happened and an overnight application of Titebond III is how I managed that. Ill probably have to sand that off. Then again from what Ive been seeing on here a contact adhesive is the correct glue for this job. I dont think the Titebond would affect that at all.In case it affects any more advice you may have for me  Ive got a couple of weeks give or take a few days to get this accomplished so Ill probably lean more toward your first reccomendation once I can get enough info to implement it.,shoemaking,d18s14q,1,t5_2uha1
