6121360,0,t1_cykqolg,god man. there was this festival in portugal once. We saw Gomez Dropkick Murphys Gogol Bordello and Pearl Jam. After Pearl Jam LCD soundsystem was going to close the show deep into the night after Pearl Jam left the stage.At the time though we didnt really know LCD and we were so god awfully tired we left after Pearl Jam  I think that was the last year of LCD being together too.,LCDSoundsystem,cylfo8c,4,t5_2wroi
