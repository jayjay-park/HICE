When the size of an alliance changes  number of members   youll notice the alliance go below the fog only to resurface a little further away with adjusted spacing between it and other alliances. If you notice the entire map going below the fog  its when there are some major alliance ranking changes going on. Happens at fixed intervals Im guessing. ,dawnoftitans,dcu8vy4,4,t5_36puw

10527947,0,t1_dd0y1wf,Oh my god Im talking to a child here.Bottom line is youre using a feature to your advantage that provides no means of counterplay just so you can have your way. Its a broken feature that allows you to dominate someone without them being able to do it back to you. Youre playing the game at an unfair advantage. There is NOTHING fair about deleting all of someones lands just because they captured your lands. Thats a cowards way to get what you want. Instead of playing the game like a war game where you start a proper war with someone from not abiding by peace rules where you go on a continuous capturing rampage. You can have peace rules but it should be played properly so that they have a chance to fight back and not just suddenly have nothing to war over. But youre just one of those people who doesnt want to admit that youre a terrible person. Delete away my friend.,dawnoftitans,dd1gh4d,1,t5_36puw
10551097,0,t1_dd3xn7h,We werent talking about defending bases  in which case  yes Id put Guardians over Infiltrators  and maybe Berserkers  there arent many of them ingame. But thats pretty much it. Paladins self buffs and Champion self buffs pretty much make the Titan MUCH more harder to kill  than any troop buff could. What will extra  Milita Health or Archer Armour  or Spearmen Resist do? Absolutely nothing. Ragnar Guardians I would say  are the only Guardians I would put at the same level as Champions  Paladins still better  since extra Goliath Health can make the battle time out before everything dies. But Ragnar Guardians are again rare. Plus I was talking about his Wulfric  which is a human Guardian the worst kind. Also  while Guardians do have a slight health advantage compared to others    when maxed out  that advantage is easily squashed by Self Buffing Defensive Skills like Resists Armour or even Extra Health. All in all Guardians are the second worst or third worst class to defend with  and the worst class to attack with.  So yes  Id rate them as the worse class overall. ,dawnoftitans,dd4330t,1,t5_36puw

10990365,0,t1_dedpqod,In hindsight I shouldve wrote Directly reduces the amount of loot a defender loses. Ill edit that out. But I believe youre wrong on this. What youre saying is basically the hard cap I talked about. A constant amount of resources that an attacker gets based on the Garrison levels. But when a Defender is packing loot above the reserve level it definetely increases the amount an attacker sees. If what you are suggesting is true then I would always see the same number of loot available when attacking a particular player but that is never the case. Just a few minutes ago I was about to hit a garrison with k gold and k something food. Just before I attacked the gold reduced to k or so. How do you explain that other than the Defender spent the gold on an upgrade thereby reducing the amount I wouldve gotten? The cooldown effect you are referring to only reinforces my point. Youre reducing the defenders wealth gt reducing the amount of hisher unprotected resources gt reducing the amount youll be able to loot.,dawnoftitans,dedq1iw,2,t5_36puw

11273947,0,t3_60ujbp,Ok here are some other changes Ive noticed so far just based on the relics I have myself. Organized by positive negative and neutral. You may want to take this with a grain of salt since people are reporting nonsensical and inconsistent changes. So I wouldnt be surprised if theres another patch to change some things further.Positive The  Ice Blade used to be militia dmg against titans is now a  Scimitar militia dmg against everything. Ok I know no one cares about militia but its still a positive. All of the  relics that used to give titan damage boosts against specific human troops Soul Thirst Dirks War Hammer are gone. Im not exactly sure what turned into what. If I had to guess old Dirks  Bitter Dirks  Panther dmg old Soul Thirst  Frost Spears  Pikemen dmg old War Hammer  Stone Mallet  Goliaths dmg. The relics that give titan damage boosts against nonhuman troops Backbiter Highlander Foecrusher Great Maul are unchanged. I did use the old relics once in a while but overall this is good since we needed straight up damage relics for these troops. All of the  relics that used to give titan resistance against specific human troops Hex Shield Svalinn Ancile are gone. Again Im not exactly sure what turned into what. One of them turned into Mount Armor  Panther healthI think it was the Svalinn resistance against archers. Going by dotdatabase Im guessing the Hex Shield resistance against militia changed to Frost Shield  Pikemen health and the Ancile resistance against Spearmen changed to Goliath Belt  Goliath health? My  Tempest has changed to a Giant Axe and its stats have improved. My  Boar Helms have changed to Dragon Helms and the stats have improved. My  Boar Spites have changed to Giant Blades and the stats have improved. My  Kite Shield now gives Spearmen health and armor instead of physical resistance.Negative Two of my  Hell Masks are gone I think they may have changed to Drake Scales  Grenadier health? Strangely one of my  Hell Masks is still there. Grenadier health is not particularly useful and this majorly stinks if you had invested in the Hell Mask for its old stats. I have a  Earth Ring and  Fire Ring both lvl . Theyve been severely nerfed.  The resistance age on both has been dropped by  points. They used to give earth and fire resistance respectively to Goliaths that has been removed and the nd ability is now locked. According to dotdatabase.net they will give militia resistance if I upgrade again. Neutral The  Drake Claws used to give militia health is now a Holy Guard and still gives militia health.  The Iron Fist and Iron Guard now give physical resistance st and healtharmor nd. Similarly Frostfist and Snowbooths gives ice resistance first healtharmor nd. Its good if youve already updated them since the healtharmor bonus is now higher than it was. Its bad if you were just using any of them for the healtharmor alone before like I was  . Im calling this neutral since the positive and negative cancel. Two of my  Earth Fists the variant that gives Goliath armor have not changed. The other one has changed to a Mountain Fist now gives titan crit and armor piercing instead of Goliath buffs My  Firemanes had a name change to Volcano Vane but have otherwise not changed.,dawnoftitans,df9vvxh,2,t5_36puw
