I work in Engineering inside Oil so i plan to work for  months in the UK and live primarily here in Cesis. So far theres not been any probelm with the transition other than that being a little confusing to most people i speak to. From my experience its all about where you want to live.

I was calling for integration of the societies on common cultural grounds. You squeezed my message into your own stereotypes and obviously thought that I am calling for genocide and deportations.  Dont you think that your scorn for the blelii the patriots and all that follows in fact stems from failing to get what it all is actually about?

7135890,0,t1_d1p9686,gt  I wouldnt use this as a point of support for the idea that people come together. Its dangerous herd mentality.But isnt that what people are? A herd of slightly intelligent animals? Do you think our leaders base their decisions by creating a detailed breakdown of demographics and weigh the possible pros and cons? Most of the times they dont. People are numbers and I write my comments based on people being numbers. Why kid myself that the State cares about me. It clearly doesnt.gt Government policies do not create wealth they only transfer it.You referenced an interesting study and Ill read it sometime later and if I remember Ill get back to you on that. However Im not talking about wealth. Im talking about net worth of a State all buildings infrastructure jobs etc. combined. I admire your idealistic views of giving more freedom to people. I dont share the same view.For the sake of an argument is there any proof that giving a person all the freedom in the world given all other things constant education social status geography etc it will actually benefit the society as a whole?

If he would acquire a Latvian citizenship then he would also become EU citizen with all the rights that come from it but its unlikely he would get double citizenship Latvian embassy to Russia says its possible if one is a Latvian Livonian was exiled due to occupation or is a child of Latvian citizen but in that case they would need to choose one citizenship after reaching adulthood and note that there are rules about living in Latvia for a certain lenght of time and having legal source of income and also in case he still is a minor so if this is something he acctualy wants it probably would be good idea to contact authorities for a consultation asap. ,latvia,d904hl4,3,t5_2rwqy
