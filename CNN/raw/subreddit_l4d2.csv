4901,0,t3_1ttlg9,Voice is perfect for friends or people who know one another after playing a  couple campaigns as a team. If you play with strangers with the formation being random each time it doesnt worth the effort trying to set a tone different languages etc to have a voice communication with them. The game can be played with text messaging or no messaging at all though I agree the live communication part adds a whole other dimension to the game. For the technical part skype is perfect when playing with your friends.,l4d2,ceeztzi,1,t5_2qzox

52329,0,t1_cek9el0,Yeah theres a way around itplay Campaign for  hours before you even think about playing Vs.  So you at least are familiar with the maps and can maybe even identify a special infected by sound alone.  If youre new to the game you have no business playing Vsyou would contribute nothing and make it difficult if not impossible for your team to have a chance at winning.,l4d2,cekdz4h,3,t5_2qzox

338528,0,t1_cffuvyq,Yes of course. Ive been seeing this error for a few days now. Every time I boot up. I can do single player and community servers just fine. But not official dedicated or Versus.And I validated my game files too and that didnt do anything. I think it might have something to do with my mods but those shouldnt be a problem right?

816803,0,t1_cgwz4j3,This. Add the  base hours before you are well practiced and know the maps like the back of your hand. There is so much strategy that has to happen without thinking. Knowing what to do with the infected that you are playing at a certain point on the map and in what combination with whatever the rest of your team mates have spawned as is something that just doesnt come in a couple days nor is it something that a nearly six year old community is going to have a lot patience to teach you at this point unfortunately.The survivors are the easier side to play with especially if youre not playing Realism VS. Oh and bless your heart if you try to go play some Scavenge... You think VS guys are assholes. lol!,l4d2,cgx4gci,-1,t5_2qzox

8173970,0,t3_4r0n6g,Ive tried blocking all the ips in peerblocker.

Ive asked nicely in their steam group as well as disrupting one of their games for a couple hours while continually saying ban me faggots. Its like theres no admins around who can actually ban anybody.I hate the servers for two main reasons. I asked to join a versus game and theyre not versus and they have audio ads that will continue one you leave the server. You can stop the ads by opening the H menu but they often refuse to load until after you leave the server so you have to listen until you find a new game.,l4d2,d4zanxo,1,t5_2qzox
