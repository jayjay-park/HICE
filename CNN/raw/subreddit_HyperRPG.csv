8027914,0,t1_d4i54fh,You know if you want to work with Highlighters theres that thing we in the know call a printer which chips some forests down for you to have a squareinch of socalled Paper. The Letters stay in the same position on there so you dont have that silly colouring on your monitor all the time. Though it might be a bit late for that as well. D,HyperRPG,d4ieval,1,t5_3cs81
8111703,0,t3_4qavri,Week  humbled me completely. Our second week of shadowrunning at Sunset Island a Horizon theme park that is about to open  except for the murderous technomancer seeking revenge for the corps past actions. But the live taping of the episode was a more epic hype train than I was really prepared for Im still processing emotions from that experience. So if you were part of that crowd THANK YOU. Thank you for the support and the love and for being such an important part of our interactive storytelling. There are some points in the video where you can see me having an emotionally difficult time processing whats happening. So overwhelmed. So much love. Anyway heres the recap of last weeks live Twitch broadcast  the video is also available ondemand at YouTube. We rejoin MMFEC in the hospital never a good sign at Cromwells bedside where he is convinced he is about to die. Hes not he had a bad run but has been stabilized. Fang has rejoined us at the hospital and is eager to ride rides but that must wait until the murderous technomancer has been dealt with. Well Mordecai is only ASTRALLY at Cromwells bedside.Manfram is approached by Horizon IT who offer to repair her deck and offer her an experimental loaner deck so that she can continue her work. Manfram under duress relinquishes her deck and refuses to share its name with the IT staff and accepts the loaner Horizon Cyber which is more powerful but less reliable.Once the replacement deck is retrieved the gang is escorted to the underbelly of the park  a series of tunnels used for janitorial and maintenance access. Horizon staff analyzed the data from the cyberattack and determined that it is an inside job  the technomancer must be holed up somewhere onproperty. The team discusses the ethics related to killing the technomancer  Man in particular has few scruples about taking this mancer out given that she has already attempted to murder half of MMFEC and a Corp Scouts troop.As it turns out the park was built atop a military base abandoned and repurposed. MMFEC is shown a blank wall and told the access point lies through it. Mercifully Cromwell still has it in him to create a door where there is only a wall. Soon a hole gapes into a completely darkened  meter dropoff. To prevent Elsie from throwing a tear gas grenade for cover Mordecai briefly astrally projects dropping into Mans arms. Once given the allclear Cromwell Elsie and Fang jump down Mordecai uses his powers of levitation and offers the services of the Mordevator to Manfram. They float effortlessly down into the darkened military shaft holding hands. As you do.Safely in the damp dark shaft the team discovers that their connections to the external Matrix do not work this far below ground. The team takes a moment to slave their commlinks to Manframs PAN personal area network to enable continued connection and to allow Cromwells jammer to provide protection without interfering with our communications.However Mordecais Gremlins strike and his device infects Mans commlink with a virus. She barely manages to cut his device off isolate and remove the virus. However unable and somewhat unwilling to take that risk again when heading up against a powerful technomancer Man does not tell Mordecai that the connection was unsuccessful. This leaves Mordecai unable to communicate at distance without using astral powers. Meanwhile Fang has to grapple with the emotional implications of slaving her cyberware to Mans PAN.Digital mischief managed the team begins progressing through the shielded hallway. Man observes a number of wall terminals where she can clip into wired networks if needed but their first obstacle an unpowered door.Cromwell heads into the room looking for adhesives and Elsie goes in looking for items to steal. Man heads in third and immediately checks her thermographic vision goggles  where she sees a tripwire grenade spring into a heat burst of activation. In the few seconds she has Man blurts out FIRE! HOLE! HIDE!With this slightly suboptimal warning most of MMFEC manages to take cover and Cromwell chooses to place himself ON the grenade using his large shield for protection. The shield shatters into a thousand pieces but the party including Cromwell survives.Naturally theres a moment of mourning for the lost shield then Cromwell pulls a smaller one out of his bag. The party decides after some healthy discussion that grapefruit will henceforth be the codeword for theres a bomb maybe you should take cover. Man also takes a quiet moment to plug into the local area network physically to scan for other threats. Just like olden prethedition times.The group decides to move forward into the next darkened hallway. They only make it halfway before they are besieged by tiny feet three fierce hordes of devil rats. The fight is prolonged considering theyre just rats. Man takes a considerable amount of damage along with Fang but Mordecai heals them and summons Sharky for further protection. Carnival Barker Sharky with rolls of tickets bursting from his stripey coat manages to take out many of the rats. Elsies flash bang takes out many of the rest.The party takes so much damage from the rats that they must rest in the hallway for an hour before progressing any further sitting amongst the carcasses of devil rats. Once recovered they progress to the end of the hallway and Manfram wires into a door terminal to open it digitally. Man Fang and Mordecai step in and find the door shut solidly behind them leaving Elsie and Cromwell in the hallway. The door becomes electrified with technomancer energy and the room begins to bake in heat as the room attempts to sterilize them to death.Man finds a terminal and wires in again. Now there are  aggressive sprites altering the local area network and causing the overheating condition. She drops into full VR to fight off the sprites leaving her completely prone to damage and disconnected from her meatspace senses including hearing. She manages to chip away at two of the sprites using Matrixconjured carnival game water guns to send them into oblivion.Unnerved by the heat Mordecai chooses to dismiss his remaining Force  Sharky services and instead summons Sharky at FULL FORCE  POWER and success yields GIGA SHARKY. Who appears to have a cybernetic face? A great white shark with bonus crab claws and jets of killer fish. GigaSharky manages to rip the next door off of its hinges with a giant icicle missile attack.Cromwell and Elsie take damage from the electrified door and decide that the only way to deal with the situation is a rocket launcher. Mordecai creates a protective barrier to keep the damage contained and Fang carries Manfram around a corner. Elsie squares off her rocket launcher Rocky and makes such a massive explosion at the door that the structural integrity of the tunnel itself is compromised. Cracks lace through the walls and chunks of the ceiling fall nearly blocking the entrance. Cromwell as if in slow motion races forward to catch Hodor the largest piece of ceiling and manages to stop it inches from the floor.Back in the sterilization room the party takes blast radius damage. As Cromwells strength wanes Mordecai steels himself and monologuesIm not actually as good with technology as people think I am. I think I need to be honest with you. That time I told you That explains it well youre one of the more attractive runners Ive worked with and elves are attractive and I thought that explained it but  I just dont want you thinking thats going to get in the way of anything were doing. Im a professional. I take my work seriously. And Im going to SAVE CROMWELL.But because of the comms issues earlier the only member of the party that heard Mordecais monologue was Fang.At the same time Manfram sustains a major hit from the remaining sprites and thanks to the resulting gremlins her deck scrambles all programs are unloaded from memory leaving her at a significant disadvantage. With a little creative thinking and determination  and by conjuring the angry mental images of the helplessness she felt at the hands of the technomancer  she doubles down and obliterates the last two sprites by shooting roller coaster tracks from her Matrix personas hands.Still Mordecai manages to heal Cromwell giving precious seconds for Elsie to slide dramatically under before Cromwell loses his strength and must roll away back into the tunnel from whence they came.Now the party is split Cromwell on the exit side of the tunnel and the rest of the party on the other side closer to their hypothetical goal. All wounded from the demented Bikram sterilization room they found themselves in. And the technomancer still lurking deeper in the tunnels.Plus all sorts of feelings.,HyperRPG,d4rtu82,1,t5_3cs81

8422067,0,t3_4snzkq,I have to say that after having watched the first two episodes I am still torn. I think it is an interesting format and I liked the folks that were on the show. Due to the format and the time constraints  I thought that the roleplaying aspect had to be cut short at times. But I guess that this might still be one of the things that will change when the show finds its groove. Therefore I am curious to see how the show will continue. ,HyperRPG,d5uatul,1,t5_3cs81

11488582,0,t3_63x5ov,I think the old guy that keeps repairing the cart is going to betray them or something. He just seems way too convenient with how many carts they keep finding. Plus they dont know hes the ragmans father they only have his word to go on that seems pretty odd.    The decisionmaker coming into play within the next episode was also interesting I thought that was going to be a slow burn many episodes down the road when everyone half forgot about it and it comes up at a critical situation.   And did I follow it correctly that dankgrass had relations with the old man sleeping in the cart? Was that what the crushed pelvis was about? ,HyperRPG,dfy89tx,1,t5_3cs81
11732304,0,t3_67e87k,Such a fun show with its own style unlike many of the others.  I do hope we see it come back at some point but I take some solace that the group is already talking about some oneoffs or some such. I am hopeful we will see the gang together again now and then at least as they are a fun group.ZenBlade,HyperRPG,dgpvxti,3,t5_3cs81
