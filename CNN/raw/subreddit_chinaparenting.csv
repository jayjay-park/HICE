Im surprised that they are allowed to watch TV but I would expect that any kids in a day care school in your home country...wouldnt really be learning anything either.  Your child is ...heshe isnt going to actually tell you too much about their day unless something REALLY sticks out.  ,chinaparenting,chncuxs,1,t5_2wtsu
11115920,0,t1_dery1wz,I contributed much more to China in taxes labor and consumer spending than my family ever used in public resources. And my daughters have always been a credit to their communities never a burden. So no problem there.Also its curious that you think the onechild policy is still a relevant and useful law. How do you justify that? You think having less children is the solution to Chinas problems?,chinaparenting,derzasx,1,t5_2wtsu
