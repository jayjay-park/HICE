141923,0,t1_cer6hpy,This sounds awfully familiar to what I experience when listening to music although my visualizations are quite bland when it comes to color or lack thereof. I would describe my visualizations as being silver but really theyre just a default imprint on a blank background if that makes sense. No spectacular colors.However the organization you mentioned percussion being white flashes near the bottom and other mid to top areas being covered like ribbons is what I relate to most. Percussion and drums are typically lower on the canvas or the background of which I see the musical visualizations atop of and vary in their size. I feel that the size and dimensions of the shapes I see are more prominent than the nuances of the shape itself. For instance all drums look somewhat the same but seem to vary depending on the particular pitch or tone each drum has. So drums will almost always appear in repetitive locations on my canvas but some may appear flat and stretched while other drum hits are more fat rounded or bulbous. Cymbals are almost always the stretched out types. Guitars are kind of meshed wiggles and hard to actually define the specific shape of. I actually dont get much in way of visualizations when I hear guitaroriented music despite me being an avid metalhead. I get the most rich visualizations with keyboards and odd sounds. Dubstep really gives me some crazy visualizations. Theyre fuzzy and and have rounded edges. They kind of fit into each other too like puzzles pieces or the teeth of cogs. For me the sounds of dubstep rub against eachother.Its interesting. For awhile I doubted I even had Synesthesia because the sounds visually make sense to me. For instance I used to doubt and kind of still do that I have it because it seems the visualizations of my sounds logically follow that of the sound. By that I mean it would make sense that cymbals are small but more stretched out lengthwise because some of the cymbals have tight crashes that are quick. It would make sense that drums are more round and bulbous because they are big full sounds when struck. It would make sense that guitars are kind of meshed together and hard to distinguish because the musician is stroking more than one chord at a time and resulting in  big sound out of  or  multiple little chords. I thought Synesthetic responses dont necessarily follow any logical sequence like that. What I mean by that is it makes much more sense to me that when a cymbal is struck I see small and stretched out shapes. Any other visualization of a cymbal such as drip like shapes one would see with rain wouldnt make sense to me.,Synesthesia,ceulfqo,1,t5_2su4p

912039,0,t3_243fia,Definitely. Certain letters like their colors more. E for example is extremely red and will often overpower other letters in a word. Even though fire has four nonred letters its mostly a red word because that e just washes out everything else. I can still see a little blue in the f but the weak colors of i and a are totally overwhelmed.,Synesthesia,ch7ydta,1,t5_2su4p

Hm Ive never really tried drugs but maybe they would have an effect on my synesthesia. Im more unconsciously aware of it. For me its very much more about the texture there are occasions within some pieces where one instrument is a different colour than in another. Haha the special snowflake comment was sort of a joke since a lot of time people think things like this are cool. At least now I know what I have. ,Synesthesia,cmn2r06,1,t5_2su4p

2979097,0,t3_2u4m7z,Depends on a variety of things.  How old you are which types you have how strong they are and what you thought about it all prior to finding more info are probably factors.  As you say it doesnt really change how you experience things at all but it might put other things into better perspective and also give you more appreciation for it.  ,Synesthesia,co6qm1l,1,t5_2su4p

3070947,0,t3_2v97sx,Yes some of the colors I see are like ethereal approximations of solid colors in real life some closer than others.But a select few have no equivalent in real life such as the aforementioned pinkyellow and also this is a strong one for me a color that is green and orange at the same time. I have also seen a color that is equal amounts of grey purple and brown and that does not seem to exist in real life.,Synesthesia,cogatw7,1,t5_2su4p
3133276,0,t3_2sdgsj,I didnt know until recently I assumed that what I was experiencing was the same as other people or unrelated to synesthesia since I have some of the rarest forms of it. After talking about it to friends and family and realizing that no one else experienced the same things I researched it and realized that I did actually have synesthesia. I have mirror touch ticker tape and object personification synesthesia. I also have misophonia which is a debated form of synesthesia.,Synesthesia,comrfqb,2,t5_2su4p
3459936,0,t3_2zuqqo,Yeah I dont think it has anything to do with synesthesia. Synesthetes dont have a uniform set of perceptions. Id say it would have to be related to something in the eye itself like the form of color blindness they mention.

3903509,0,t3_350wkq,imho this is synesthesiaI have colorgttastesmell and form of mirror touch where I feel literally all d objects and their qualities and associated tastes smells and also normal mirror touch where I feel other people on my body. In mix with all of this are various other types like assotiating colors with letters not seeing them though and something like you describe. My mood and how I perceive sound and my body can change upon seeing some colorcombination of colors. I actually use it to change how I feel visualizing colors.Because I have so much types and this is just one of them that feel in the same bag as the other and normal people do not have either of effects that I have I guess it is synesthesia too.If however that is only one type that you have then it might be not enough to call yourself synesthete. If you want to be there is link between meditation and energy work opening chakras etc and synesthesia. It can help unlock your potential and crank your synesthesia up to some ridiculous levels which you could not ignore anymore. It is all about potential. Most people as you noticed on shrooms have zero potential in this some however can achieve great things.,Synesthesia,cr18fq8,1,t5_2su4p

6219208,0,t1_cyj132v,I get that that too that people dont believe me they have never heard of synethesia. One even believed I was on drugs or something.For me the colours of letters are the same in the languages I am familiar with  Dutch English German French Spanish. I dont speak the last three well French and Spanish really not at all but the colours are all the same to me. Also for me the vowels are generally more colourful. Could affect how I see things like Arabic or Hebrew that often dont wrote down the vowels as they have abjads and not a true alphabet from what I know.Now what would be interesting is to see how it works with languages that have another script such as Cyrillic.,Synesthesia,cywk1t8,2,t5_2su4p

6710121,0,t1_d0axsyh,What is an advanced type of synesthesia? What objective criteria make certain types of synesthesia more advanced than others? Is it perceived or reported commonness vs. uncommonness with types assumed to be common chromaesthesia for example are elementary and types assumed to rarer taste perhaps are more advanced? From an objective angle I cannot think of any objective criteria that make linkages among certain sense systems more or less advanced than other sensory setups. What empirical biological criteria are you using to rank the senses and synesthesia? Does such a ranking system have objective value or utility?    From a subjective standpoint it seems that calling certain types advanced is a way for people with types assumed to be less common to compensate for the way their types are less wellknown and less wellunderstood by assuming a posture of superiority. A similar example could be when left handed people say lefties are superior to righties despite the distinction being pretty much meaningless. Arguments based on the advantages we can gain when we exploit our synesthesias are pretty silly for example number form synesthetes can remember many strings of numbers but in an hour I can make a hour playlist based on matching up timbres by color. As a musician and radio DJ I can benefit just as much from my synesethia as a number form mathematician or scientist can from theirs. And anyone may have unique subjective views that not only inform which types they favor but their subjectivity may shape their definition of what advanced might be. For example someone who imagines or experiences that name gt smell synesthesia or grapheme synesthesia are unpleasant may decide that advanced means that the synesthesia causes minimal discomfort. Therefore they might imagine or decide through experience that chomaesthesia is more advanced than other types. Research is showing that microdosing LSD and psilocybin have powerful benefits. Drugs do not necessarily harm. This is not an endorsement of an anything goes policy but rather an insistence that in this day and age a more nuanced and educated stance toward drugs is needed.  ,Synesthesia,d0ddu2w,1,t5_2su4p
