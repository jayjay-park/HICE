4131171,0,t3_36r3fg,I took the Spirit of Tasmania ferry from Melbourne to Tasmania with my triumph sprint.  spent  weeks riding out there and it was some of the best scenery and roads Ive ever ridden.  Though Ive been told the roads can get slick as the weather can be a bit unpredictable.  changes from beautiful coastline to tropical mountains within a matter of miles.  and plenty of hostels to stop at as well as spots to camp. Fun locals to grab a beer with too especially in the north.,motorcyclesroadtrip,crr6e9k,1,t5_374zx

4210617,0,t1_cs05jmu,Haha... I cant argue with you there. Although the first time I took it off road mind you it was a few hundred feet off road I got stuck. It is a beast! Weighs roughly lbs more than my Daytona. Id like to ride with some knobby tires and eventually do some adventure touring. ,motorcyclesroadtrip,cs074dc,1,t5_374zx
4351705,0,t1_csg4az9,Yeah I noticed that.   He seems to be someone who sells old parts that one photo probably shouldnt have been there.  If you were going to go that route Id definitely email him for clarification.  I just recently spent the better part of  months looking for a rack for my existing sissy bar.  The folks who sell these parts and know what they are and tend to ask for top dollar.  If you search for yamaha  rack youll have to trudge through a bunch of stuff you dont want but eventually youll find one at a decent price.  Mine the going price for a used one Honda Sabre MC enterprices rack was .  I looked for months then realized the MC ent. rack was universal for most bikes.  Ended up getting the sissy bar AND another seat for  for a honda shadow ace.  Kept rack and sold sissy bar for !,motorcyclesroadtrip,csg649d,1,t5_374zx

5281349,0,t1_cvmp146,Yes I am going alone. I kind of thought of the ride itself as the vacation. Trying to pick some stops out along the way. Key West isnt essential either I just figured itd be cool to see the end of US  on the bike. ,motorcyclesroadtrip,cvmr5g6,1,t5_374zx
