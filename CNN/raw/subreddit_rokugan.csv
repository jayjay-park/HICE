3449667,0,t3_2zplin,Most of my games are halfayear to a year long with a couple notable exceptions that ran a bit longer.LR in general is definitely a deadly system and world and thats the point. Samurai drama rarely ends well and even the Core Rulebook says as much. If youre careful Rokugan can be a safe place  but its hard to tiptoe around courtiers and be safe in battle without losing honor and glory in the process. Doing ones duty is rarely synonymous with being safe such is the samurais life.Unlike DampD or other highfantasy games I would also say that LR never stops being deadly. I was playing in a game with Insight Rank  samurai and I swear this is true one of them nearly died to a peasant chucking rocks midbattle.All told I havent seen too much PC death just a lot of PC crippling. I watched an Utaku maiden lose a horse a Phoenix henshin monk nearly die she would have but I didnt have the heart to kill a samurai in their gempukku trial so I gave a pure void roll to cling to Ningendo. One of my characters commited seppuku after helping install a friend as the clan champion of the Scorpion to hide the taint he had taken on in his anger at losing his secret peasant love. I played a Tsuruchi archer that died in the big climatic battle mostly because when crazy stuff went down she charged into melee to try and save friends rather than stay away and keep herself safe.Two houserules Ive found to be useful if you want to safeguard against PC deaths Normally HP is Earth Ring x  for first rank Earth Ring x  for all others  which is fine but it can really punish heroic last attempts. What I do instead is Earth Ring x for the final rank of wounds it makes characters just as easy to incapacitate but also gives a bit of a buffer against lucky last hits  and encourages PCs to give those heroic hold the line moments. During lessthanclimatic moments give players a sort of free Great Destiny charge  a hit thatd kill them instead doesnt. This doesnt mean players are invulnerable just that one lucky roll wont kill them in an anticlimatic way. Of course a second roll...At the end of the day though LR is one of the more lethal RPG systems Ive ever played and Id like to think Ive played quite a few. Players cannot approach the system like they might DampD as massive heroes. They are simply samurai and while they may have a heroic destiny the realities of the world means that generally speaking when a blade comes out of a scabbard someones going home in a box.Metaphorically speaking of course. More likely their body will be beheaded or burned but thats a story for another day PEdit as a player if you want to avoid death right out of the gate Earth  and Void  upping those two rings will keep you so much safer than youd expect. Getting your Reflexes up to  never hurt anyone either.,rokugan,cplhlg6,6,t5_2sjr8
3571798,0,t1_cpyv7pi,Bingo. Ninja dont exist in story at least. There are schools tagged as Ninja but thats it.Yay for the Emperor saying ninja dont exist.,rokugan,cpzev7p,4,t5_2sjr8
4623017,0,t1_ct7hwfa,Theres absolutely nothing stopping you from doing so.  Your personae are people that you literally become.  However this doesnt mean that you cant pretend to be others still.  Youre the perfect mole.  They wouldnt be personas like your school techniques.  Theyd instead for temporary recon.  Itd be something youd do for quick missions while your personae are for elaborate infiltration.For instance youd disguise as a stablehand a peasant to go unnoticed around the Unicorn estate and gather recon and information.  Youd use your school technique to become an Unicorn to infiltrate their clan and further the goals of the Scorpion.,rokugan,ctdb0k9,0,t5_2sjr8
5478301,0,t3_3q3ypt,All sorts of complications could come up here. I really like it!You could add some more conflict by having the town elder be friends with  sheltering some wavemen who helped advise the elder to sell the gift. They could even be former samurai from a neighbouring clan who turned renegade rather than inflict the same punishment on their own peasants. They could try to protect the town from the punishment offer their own lives in recompense or help advise the players on how to deal with the insulted daimyo.If you run quickly through the scenario for some reason you could have an optional objective being to retrieve the daimyos gift and return it. In fact the townsmen may have sold it but sold it under duress  maybe bandits or ronin were envious of the gift threatened the town elder and then gave him the option of selling it to them. Then youd get to hunt them down as an option instead of disobeying the daimyo or punishing the town.,rokugan,cwbwjyj,3,t5_2sjr8
5568178,0,t1_cwmv0tr,Then Mechanically speaking your character would just be a Lion Bushi.  If at some point you quit your clan and become a monk you would lose all your equipment and money and probably your technique depending on the GM and gain the monk ability instead.    Flavor wise youd be shunned by the Lion clan and likely be branded a coward.  You need to remember that Early Retirement is basically giving up the duties of a Samurai to your clan and the empire to serve yourself selfishly.  I dont think the Lion would even tolerate normal retirement.  You would be expected to serve until you die in glorious battle in the service of the clan.  The monks would take you in any case Im sure but everyone else would look down on you this is not something you or the character should take lightly.,rokugan,cwna7me,2,t5_2sjr8
6289825,0,t1_cz4kppw,I see. Then would making it require the ring the spell was cast in and only allowing elemental magic So no copying MahoGaijin magicVoid spells work? That way the spells utility isnt casting another persons magic but better but instead about using a spell you dont currently know. Even then would you recommend making it mastery rank ?,rokugan,cz4kyzo,1,t5_2sjr8

6469348,0,t3_447eqo,Im running two campaigns right now. The first one started on the year  two years after the rise of the spider clan and later we had a generation jump to the year  during the Madness in the colonies. This era was fun since the Spider were new at first and the players were adapting to this new evil within the empire. If this campaign would continue I think Ill do a second generation jump to the reign of Iweko Miaka as the next empress and play with the idea of the Spider slowly integrating into the empire since Im not fond of how the canon story turned out. My second campaign started in the year  which I used because I found out about the IronWilled Emperor and decided to use him in the guise of a ronin to meet up my players who were ronin themselves at the time. Eventually this group went on to form the Bear Clan that now guards the Beiden Pass. We have now jumped a generation to the year  with the Minor Clans forming an early alliance of sorts to fight a conspiracy that wants them vanished from the empire. The years were prime for use since nothing canon appears to take place then. If this storyline is resolved I think Ill take it to the Clan Wars or the Coup era simply due fun factors. ,rokugan,czoh5v7,1,t5_2sjr8

6710283,0,t1_d0bh2vo,Technically you dont need to cut off someones hand Its pretty hard to use your hand once youre been stabbed straight through the palm.RPGs in general have a very hard time accounting for dirty fighting which gets ludicrous when you look at Crab Pargmatists or the Mantis ruffians in general who arent all that inhibited by honorable combat.Personally Id just stay away from the whole thing because its pretty hard to make up rules for groin kicks or eye gouges.,rokugan,d0defsl,1,t5_2sjr8

8368689,0,t1_d5loxq7,I see that is interesting. Just based on some of the schools as they read though I dont see the Shark as being the best choice... That said I think you did a pretty good job overall on them and they seem to have a flavor that works and is relatively special to them.  It almost seems like they would have stuck with the mantis and got a branch family but being on ones own is pretty cool as well.  I have had to create clans in game before examples are elephant and rooster. ,rokugan,d5nmxc4,1,t5_2sjr8

10141027,0,t3_5l4t86,Hey Im really enjoying this podcast! Id been looking for actual plays beyond the One Shot podcast and the Happy Jacks game. So this was perfectly timed for me. Im enjoying the role play and listening to some of the mechanics.Positive Feedback I love the interplay between the players and the DM the players and the DM hand off the storyline and hand control of the narrative back and forth in a really healthy way that I admire.Negative Feedback Not really a huge negative in the scope of things but if you could be a little more conscious about talking about what youre rolling and why it would help me learn the rules while you play. Im one of those folks that learned to play DampD by listening to the excellent Penny Arcade podcasts so I love hearing some of the mechanics during the game and you all do a little of that here and there.That negative feedback is very minor Ill keep listening either way. Just food for thought! Thanks for this podcast! Thanks for being a model gaming group as far as active players actively taking control of their characters without stepping on the DM and an active DM who keeps the story going without stepping on the characters.,rokugan,dbtdp4m,2,t5_2sjr8

10925772,0,t1_de45on0,Thinking about cooperative rollsA Kaiu or Tsi Smith with  helpers seems like a reasonable team size.The main smith Lets pick Kaiu has to have Rank  anyway so lets say hes at Rank  Intelligence . Thats a basic k then we spend a Void point for k bringing us to k  close! We even add the Emphasis because why not.Were going for that Radiant Katana because its badass so TN .  because were Kaiu trained and get a Free Raise so actual TN   which turns out is still a  chance. Wed have to have several dice explode and roll high with the others.Okay so we have four helpers which well assume are all trained smiths too since this is the big project and all the good smiths will work on it. They are a little less skilled than the main man and have Rank  skills. All together they contribute   bringing effective TN down to . Chance to succeed .Okay there are several way we can improve this. Kaiu as an Ancestor would improve Void Points to k so that our Kaiu would get k bringing us up to k and a  chance of success.How about Rank  in the skill instead? Its more expensive but it gets us to k instead and adds a free raise on top. Now the effective TN is  vs k A whopping  chance.Include Kaiu for another ? .Give every helper  ranks so that its now the Grandmaster smith and the Master smiths helping? Extra  for a  chance of success.A set of  smiths one at Rank  with the appropriate emphasis four at Rank  with two Free Raises a massively improved Void Point worth k can only craft a Radiant Katana  of the time.Thats pretty ludicrous.Edit Intelligence  adds  to the whole thing bringing this up to . Intelligence  brings it to  but Traits over  are hugely expensive and seem somewhat out of line. Intelligence  changes a lot of stuff but at that point you could reach   with this whole set up. Still ludicrous.,rokugan,de6x0v0,1,t5_2sjr8
11736502,0,t1_dgq5nf3,I assume you meant th or th century. Armies game up on Armor by the th century. And a th century had to contend with rain and I dont mean fire as in you have to sneak in and blow things up. I am talking about targetable fire. A few Water and fire Shugenja make it rain on arqubusiers and then drop fire on the cannon caisson. Huh doing a quick wiki on it It appears that the first Portuguese that arrived did not use volleys but instead relied on the pikedefended single man arquebus drill.  The Japanese developed it first or in tagent with the Portuguese in Asia. Thats something. gtIm going for a mix of Meijiera tactics and weaponry and older stuff. Not to get Pedantic but you keep saying Meiji Era tactics and weaponry and then discussing Arquebuses and avoiding Gatling guns.  The problem is Edo period or Sengoku period is way before the industrial revolution and the Meiji period after it. The Arquebus was a lowpowered and inaccurate weapon compared to the Chasspots and Enfields of the Boshin War. The Enfield allowed for firing in the rain was a faster to load  rounds a minute for an experienced shooter and could hold a bayonet. I mean in just  years they went from Flintlock to Caplock and the development of the Minnie ball allowed faster load times for the Enfield and Springfield rifles. In fact the Minnie ball was responsible for so many deaths compared to the round ball as it was much more likely to shatter bones leading to amputation. It also increased range of the gun and power of the gun.  The bullet design over this period was important.  Denshutai Hussars had carbines that fired  times before reloading and depending on design were reloaded fairly fast.So it may sound pedantic to discuss it I am trying to make sure you understand that the guns of the th century Which is basically Rokuans time were just plain awful and primitive compared Meiji era guns even discounting the Gatling gun.  ,rokugan,dgqd1ug,1,t5_2sjr8
