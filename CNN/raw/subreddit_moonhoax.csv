4529820,0,t1_ct0ob1f,Most of a Saturn V falls to earth as it goes up.  You have an interesting point about the lunar meteorites.  How different are they ALL from ALL the rocks on earth to prevent something from earth being fobbed off as being from the moon.  Picture two normal curve distributions one earths one the moons  what is the degree of overlap?  How many dimensions of analysis is needed to distinguish beyond a shadow of doubt any of the rocks from the moon from all the rocks from the earth?I suppose another robust argument is just because we believe we have rock from the moon doesnt mean that a person went there  it could be some kind of droid. And if turned out that the rocks are genuine and the whole Saturn V is up there somewhere that does not prove that the people on the surface pictures are genuine. ,moonhoax,ct1mbbc,2,t5_2qnh9

Which experiment would you prefer to take part in?.,moonhoax,d46c0gn,1,t5_2qnh9
