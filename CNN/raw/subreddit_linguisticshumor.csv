8920064,0,t1_d7k1e9d,No problem. Keep in mind that this chaining phenomenon is not grammatically correct only the first and final examples Ik was daar aan het roepen and Ik heb op je staan wachten are correct to use. Ik was daar staan roepen is actually not correct as it should use the auxiliary verb heb not was. However in spoken Dutch you will encounter grammatical incoherences such as that one on a regular basis. I hope this can help you make some sense of those instances.Good luck with learning our language! If theres anything in particular you struggle with I could perhaps give it some context for you. Feel free to message me if the need arises.,linguisticshumor,d7k27pz,6,t5_2vwiq
