183467,0,t1_cez60kg,Nope this style specifically is based on side clamping of the seat rails. You can see it on many of Specialized high end seatposts also on Trek MadoneDomane seatmast.The clamp area is two cups facing out. Another cup sits in each of those and then an outer clamp goes outside of that. A bolt runs through the centre and pulls the three layers in tight.Heres an exploded diagram of the assembly which is much better at illustrating the design than my poor technical descriptionThis in theory gives an infinitesimally adjustable seat angle. In practice I find that the design binds easily when youre trying to adjust and slips easily when riding. A bit of carbon prep helps but Ive still had problems.,Bikeporn,cezc12f,1,t5_2s9rb

It prevents mud from spraying up in the face of the rider which is nice given the fact that we have a lot of sheep roaming around the mountains in the summer and getting sheep shit in your mouth is always a joy. The variant from Mucky Nuts also prevents some mud from hitting the stanchions and seals of the fork. According to one of my local gurus he had less need for servicing his forks after starting using fenders like this.This is also a frequently seen variant  The RRP model has an even better protection for keeping mud hitting the face as I understand but it does not provide the same advantages for keeping mud away from your fork legs.,Bikeporn,cindvdn,1,t5_2s9rb

The DB Air is a great shock but if I were to do it again I would get the DB Inline for this bike.

I found that the DB Air ramped up too much i.e. not enough air volume even with all of the air can spacers removed. The other reason is that I had to modify the climb switch on the DB Air to get it to clear the downtube frame size S.

No like you want any more advice but with some small changes you could have a super dope bike on your hands. Replace the derailler with tiagra or even better an old  speed xtr. Then you have the range to put on a cassette with  teeth and boom! Huge huge gear range. Replace the tires with the rat trap pass model from compass bikes. Either raise the bars to seat level the point of stems like that or replace the stem with a nitto. Repost here when finished!,Bikeporn,d654zt7,1,t5_2s9rb

10500886,0,t1_dcvwbpt,gt They dont use a bigger tire because tires larger than c on road bikes tend to net a negative result. So moving from a c to a c allows lower pressure more bump compliance and less rolling resistance. Once you move bigger then c you start to loose what you gained because of increased air resistance of the larger tire and increased weight of the tires.Subtract  size from all the figures above and its exactly what people used to say in praise of tiny rock hard tires. The preferred size was  and even less once upon a time and its come around to . Now you see the light of  but... give a nice  a try if you have a bike that can fit em.

It really limits my options as far as hubs go thats part of the reason why I have Phil hubs on my Baramon although the Keirin axles are now discontinued!.  To be honest Id do Campagnolo Sheriff Stars on this bike if I didnt have plans to ride it on the street however theyre notoriously fragile.
