1393832,0,t1_cipocns,I was wondering that myself. Default would seem to be the term that the author was looking for but oddly enough she used it earlier in the article. gtBut he said a wide crosssection of devices shared a handful of common security holes including lack of authentication to access or manipulate the equipment weak passwords or default and hardcoded vendor passwords like admin or  and embedded web servers and administrative interfaces that make it easy to identify and manipulate devices once an attacker finds them on a network.,healthIT,ciqzxnv,1,t5_2s4yt
1519738,0,t1_cj6rrx6,Agreed .  Im unaffiliated with the blog the author and dont do anything with regards to recruitment but I found the statistics interesting.I work at a rural healthcare organization that while not exactly isolated isnt exactly on the cutting edge of anything.  When I see people bandy about ideals that want X experience in Cerner or Epic or McKesson I just really wonder where they think these people are going to come from.  Certainly not locally and certainly not cheaply.,healthIT,cj6rycf,6,t5_2s4yt

I never got a response from EPIC in regard to the apptitude test I had to take a few weeks ago. Im not sure if the Hosp makes the decision or EPIC. MAybe you would know ?

3415508,0,t3_2z915m,David Uhlman and I wrote a book about Health IT for OReilly Media and it is specifically designed for people like you...Hacking HealthcareThe book is designed to be readable with someone with a understanding of SQL HTTP and other core technology concepts and turn them into someone who feels at least a little comfortable with the alphabet soup of Health IT. Books can be a little thick so we are thinking about branching into a podcast too... more soon. Other than that I would recommend that you start participating in your local HIMSS chapter. Personally I think that the national HIMSS conference is something of a depressing tribute to excess mostly because of the tradeshow floor but the educational materials that they have and the sessions that they run really are the best thing for someone is trying to learn.

5398918,0,t1_cw1ph9t,The RHIA is far from just billingcoding and can encompass a huge portion of the HIIM field. For example I am in a technical role now working data integrity and identity verification. I wouldnt know how to code to save me life other than sequencing and administration. With the HIM world becoming more and more electronic and technical I think it will be important for the HI people to understand the laws and regulations. Plus it is an amazing certification to have. My HIM department is actually under the IT umbrella for my organization. I have an undergrad degree in health informatics and I am working to move into an analyst role. I think my RHIA only helps me in that endeavor. ,healthIT,cw1rru3,3,t5_2s4yt

8382946,0,t1_d5p7qoz,The VA uses VistA. The DoD just got a contract with Cerner. VistA is built on the same architecture as Epic and Epic lost the DoD contract. I am guessing the VA will discontinue VistA at some point and adopt Cerner as well. The coolest part about their Cerner upgrade is that is will be hosted by Cerner. So its a huge cloud implementation. Which I think will help hospitals start to adopt the trend...hopefully.,healthIT,d5pf06q,2,t5_2s4yt
