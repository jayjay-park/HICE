Not a native speaker so not sure if thats the only definition isnt that popular here Ive only done it once in my life. It went ok not much different from just drinking a beer from a glass in  go which we do do a lot usually isnt a problem but after about  beers I get the vomitburps.,noburp,cgfm1k1,1,t5_30z05

1710332,0,t3_2cr5wk,I can make myself burp on command the best advice I can give is to almost swallow so your epiglottis covers your trachea and then suck in air you should not be able to inhale immediately there should be a minor resistance and then a buildup of air in the stomach. then you just exhale it out. I dont know if this will help at all as I could always burp this is just how I do it on command.,noburp,cjuqzis,1,t5_30z05

5957669,0,t1_cxzf52s,Aww super sorry to hear you got sick. How does a coldplugged nose affect the croak? Being sick in no wayshape or form influences my croak unless Ive gotten the stomach bug and am croaking to relieve the rising pressure.My croaks are very very similar to your experiences but there is a slight twist in the end. I feel my stomach rumbling then a gas bubble rises up the esophagus reaches the very very bottom of my neck all of a sudden stops in one place for a heartbeat or two and then very slowly and carefully the air starts rising through my neck bypassing larynx and pharynx to create the low lioness growls and exits the entire digestive system in the top of my throatback of my mouth. ,noburp,cy0kxq5,1,t5_30z05

6210940,0,t1_cyvbyxz,Yes constantly in fact. It just gurgles up and fails to come out because the sphincter wont relax and open. So it just keeps trying to come out over and over and over again. It sucks BALLS.,noburp,cyvm7wv,1,t5_30z05
