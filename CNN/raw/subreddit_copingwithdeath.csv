880426,0,t3_2453zk,I agree with MrsMack. When my dad passed about two months ago I was absolutely devastated and I screamed and I cried and I cursed everything. Shouting at the top of my lungs and writing him letters or talking with him. Anything you can use to cope with death is something that you should. It doesnt make you crazy it just means youve had something taken away from you that absolutely no one is prepared for even if youre told. Its never really easy man and I hope you can weather this and do NOT think about the what ifs. Good luck man.,copingwithdeath,ch4cw13,1,t5_305sg
