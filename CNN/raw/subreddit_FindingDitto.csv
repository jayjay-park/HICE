Have you got a link or something?Edit Also someone confirmed it was at the gym until it was beaten recently see the gym battle video.  Either someone is going to some extreme measures to spoof this for shits and gigs or there is something to all of this.,FindingDitto,d60vuad,5,t5_3fn6n

8503658,0,t3_4w1b1x,Ok so bare with me with this explanation I went to that Voltorb spawn and used GoRadarone of the few map apps still functioning to know exactly were they were. First I got a couple that spawned close to each other thought to myself to do it a couple more times to have more to experiment with. To my surprise in GoRadar after they spawned again I noticed that after a while  clocks would overlap GoRadar has a timer that shows how much time left you have before the pokemon disappears with a difference of a second and they were in the exact same spotnot close to each other literally exact coordinates as the other one and its hard to notice it before anyone says it might have been the app causing this problem I tried spotting other pokemon and not a single other clock had this issue so I waited a while to see if this happened again AND IT DID! I tried going to those spots a couple times but only one Voltorb would pop up I tried everything from taking pictures turning around in AR mode catching it with a curveball renaming them Ditto trying pesterball combinations after catching them even catching the pokemon close to it but nothing happenedthinking about using an incense around them. I dont know if you guys have any ideas on what to do with them but I think this timer and location thing is a real breakthrough in the search of Ditto and we might be really close to getting it! Edit I got screenshots on the timer before catching after catching renaming etc. Pretty new to Reddit so I dont really know if you can post images in comments or if I should start another thread to post them guide me and I will post them.Edit Even at a certain point I checked my nearby list and  voltorbs were in it but in the radar it only showed  in the area and they both had overlapped timersgot a screenshot of it too ,FindingDitto,d64ietw,3,t5_3fn6n
8503917,0,t3_4w71hu,I dont believe Ditto will be related to a breeding reward because as the CEO said in the SDCC panel they thought about breeding for a while then trashed it because they thought people would find it boring. He only said after the question was asked in the QampA that he will put it in the todo list because people in the room were hyped about it.I believe they have other plans for Ditto.,FindingDitto,d64jkwv,3,t5_3fn6n

8649746,0,t3_4xx9wu,I cant find the post right now but someone on another PoGo subreddit mentioned that the Niantic help site also says the standard bag size is  items or something like that.

8973506,0,t3_5373c4,First of all I dont think Mewtwo will be released with the same spawning mechanic as Dragonite Lapras or Charizard. Because Mewtwo still is a legendary Pokmon and I think Niantic wants to make an event out of that getting the hype up for people getting bored with the game. Furthermore I dont think they could get away with it that someone finally got a Mewtwo and than the disappointment when it turns just into a Ditto. This would also mean that Ditto would be far more rarer than Mewtwo which just doesnt seem logical to me.,FindingDitto,d7qha4m,3,t5_3fn6n
