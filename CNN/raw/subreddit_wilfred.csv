8359,0,t3_1o3z36,Wilfred is the crossroads demon. the sign on the chest finalized my thought. the crossroad demon is known to make deals with people on terms of trading with the persons soul. Henry Newmans soul for ryan to work at the firm?Either that or this crossroads just indicates that wilfred is a supernatural beingEDIT This may also have an indication of Ryans mindset. This happened at the end of the first and second season. If I can shamefully quote an excerpt from wikipedia Symbolically it can mean a locality where two realms touch and therefore represents liminality a place literally neither here nor there betwixt and between.  It might be a theme of being insane. Albert Einstein has said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  Ryan is mentally ill in the literal sense and  this symbol denotes him just doing the same thing every single day getting high with a dog in a basement half the day and expecting his life to improve.,wilfred,cefdyx9,1,t5_2sl2e

1528492,0,t3_2blq1f,The only real reason I want them together is because he pursued her for so long but other than that I think its borderline parasitic. Other than the time they gave Ryan a check before he got back into the work force its always been Ryan helping and bailing out Jenna rather inappropriate on her side in some instances considering she was married.I think a lesson will be that looking for love wont lead to his happiness that Ryan needs to find happiness within himself before he can romantically love another in a healthy manner. Like I said I sympathize with him because hes wanted her for so long and had to keep it mostly bottled in. But now I think even HES realizing that its just not supposed to be. You never know hopefully shell do something radically selfless that proves shes worthy and shell be less onesided. You never know with these writers. I just hope it ends with Ryans happiness as the pilotfinale episode hints at with the title. ,wilfred,cj7vgfq,0,t5_2sl2e

1670681,0,t1_cjpqods,Okay scripts of a show or character behavior doesnt always have to adhere to the normal actions of a person.

Of course he wasnt dogs cant operate a bong but he wouldve inhaled a lot of second hand smoke since Ryan thought they were having a smoking session together.Wilfred also coughs while trying to smoke in the same episode which is meant to plug it all in as to what the cause is.Ryan was responsible!,wilfred,cjqmzzu,1,t5_2sl2e

Its both tragic and happy as an ending Wilfred and Ryan stay united but Ryan also effectively admits to himself his mental illness is part of him.From my perspective this is how mental illness really does affect peoplein the end those with mental illness can learn ways to cope like Ryan does but very few can ever separate themselves from it completely.I think the statement the ending makes as well as its bittersweet nature was entirely perfect.
