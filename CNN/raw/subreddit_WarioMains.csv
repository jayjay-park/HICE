5180889,0,t3_3lyalt,Halfcharged waft kills at about  full charged at about .Cheese the bike as much as possible.Antagonize your opponent into making punishable mistakes.,WarioMains,cvahjdy,1,t5_38e8v
5188188,0,t3_3lyalt,Moreso than what has already been said the chomp is so much more than just a simple air grab.   You can eat PROJECTILES this limits your opponents choice of moves for example megamanmy favourite matchup can only guarantee his bair and fair on wario EVERYTHING else is edible albeit the uair and dair are slightly more difficult to eat.Every projectile you eat with warios chomp takes  second off of the waft timer and sometimes heals you for  too depending on the item.This makes the following matchups a LOT easiergtMegamangtDuck HuntgtSamus and ZSSgtVillager cant eat tree but everything else including timber.And those are just the ones off the top of my head.  Also if you eat a healing item with chomp you heal additional percent.  This is especially noteable in niche situations with villager where tree drops a fruit or with pacmans halted side B dot.C h o m p b o y s,WarioMains,cvbd7tw,2,t5_38e8v
