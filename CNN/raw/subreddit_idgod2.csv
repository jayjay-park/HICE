9304051,0,t1_d8vbp6u,Rush shipping doesnt usually do much. I emailed him a few times to get his attention like it says. I got my tracking number a day or two later. Make sure to include your order number in the email  ,idgod2,d8vctj4,1,t5_3gs3g
9305834,0,t1_d8v9veg,I knew mine shipped by clicking the link on the email that I received after I put my order it. It will bring you to almost an app like page that has western union your order number and shipping status on it. There it will say shipped after some time idgods confirmation emails you received exactly after your order will clarify on exact time. And you can email him about tracking info I believe. However I have emailed him once with no response. You may have to email him a few times but I would be sure to email him after that certain amount of days or after it shipped because multiple emails have been known to annoy him and hold up your order.,idgod2,d8vkye7,3,t5_3gs3g
9345874,0,t3_58ho94,I ordered on the th as well and I havent got mine either.
