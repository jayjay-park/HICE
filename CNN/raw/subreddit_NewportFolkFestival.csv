For me while I thought the covers were good it felt like this was a let down for the festival and for the hype they had created around this last set. It felt like the festival took an easy route  shifting from the vanguard to nostalgia. ,NewportFolkFestival,cthrhmy,2,t5_310k2

The Jamestown ferry is a decent walk from camp especially with chairs and gear but we usually have one person with an suv make  or  trips so we only have to pay for parking at the ferry for one car.The biggest advantage aside from being relatively inexpensive is the ferry line home is WILDLY shorter than the one to downtown Newport. Like .Holler at us if you guys end up there. ,NewportFolkFestival,damjd3e,2,t5_310k2
