1247368,0,t3_28b1jp,I have a  Honda CBF that looks really authentic as in old and grubby. Not sure you would want to take fancy pictures of it. I do all my own maintenance so I have tools but they are not antique by any means.,rideottawa,ci9y0db,2,t5_315hq
1266685,0,t1_cibxgym,Thanks for the reply! See Ive read up on and watched videos about those concepts and been able to apply them a little bit but its partly confidence. I was forced to make a slow wide turn and ended up dumping my bike pretty early on so that messed with my head a bit. I know to expect things like that but I just want to have enough confidence in my ability to execute the basics like applying rear brake before a turn if needed instead of front brake and to accelerate midway through the turn to straighten the bike to push myself a bit and grow. Thanks for the response!,rideottawa,cic49j9,1,t5_315hq
1628689,0,t1_cjkfxkk,The picture on the CTV page showed a helmet on the road. It looked undamaged yet he died of head injuries. Hard to really say from just that one picture but I wonder if he didnt have the chin strap done up. A fall from a bicycle can kill you without a helmet.edit spelling,rideottawa,cjkglxi,3,t5_315hq

2359965,0,t1_cm3a6a7,The ride wasnt that bad. It was a little cold but bearable with enough layers. I faced the age old dilemma. Do I go really fast and get to where in going faster or do I go slow and stay warm. I went fast. ,rideottawa,cm3ehon,1,t5_315hq

3497517,0,t1_cpqkm09,Dude I sold a  RDF that had been crashed  times very hard to a guy for ...Motorcycles are worth what people are willing to pay for them. The Sub cc endurosumo class is taking off right now because they bikes are stupid fun and easy to maintain not to mention cheap to insure. Look at the pricing of a DRZ or hell even a Grom.  is a fairly decent price for a CRF in pretty mint condition. ,rideottawa,cpqxxpa,2,t5_315hq

4313593,0,t3_3acuxl,I think its a really good photo. Well composed and exposed with pleasing lines. It feels like it might be a little skewed so I might experiment with rotating it just a teeny bit clockwise. I feel the post processing is slightly heavy handed. To me the ray of light dodging effect on the bike is a little too in your face and could probably be a bit more subtle if you did it at all. It seems like there might have actually captured some cloud detail which means you could potentially do it in a really high contrast which could make it look more interesting. Perhaps even mask off the sky to really punch it up.,rideottawa,csbv9nd,1,t5_315hq
