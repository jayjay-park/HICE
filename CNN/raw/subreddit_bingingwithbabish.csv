11651362,0,t3_665os9,I totally support you going fulltime with this. With whats happening with advertising on the platform sponsorships and Patreon seem like the only way to reliably make money on YouTube. I say go for it but only if youre not going to be dependant on the AdSense revenue from the videos. Granted a cooking show isnt that controvertial but things keep changing rapidly. . . ,bingingwithbabish,dggp2lc,2,t5_3ialh
