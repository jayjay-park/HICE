Some may have been less obvious Target for example has chip slots but they had a plastic insert to cover them up. In the past few weeks theyve started removing the inserts and theyve posted info on their web site about their new chip version of the REDcard so Im guessing well start to see them using the chip slot soon.Home Depot just started enabling the chip slots within the past few weeks as well. The prompts initially only mention swipe but if you wait long enough it will say insert swipe or tap. Try waiting for the cashier to finish and total your transaction rather than swiping early. Its still unclear whether theyve rolled support out to all stores nationwide yet or if theyre doing a phased rollout like Walmart did.Walmart is the leader in getting chip enabled. They did a phased rollout to cover all their stores including Sams Club over a period of a couple months last year. So if you have a Walmart near you your chip Amex will work there with the chip. You can find other places that have been reported to have been chip enabled and add that Mexican place if its not already there at  which is run by utmiw.Debit cards seem to still be causing problems but since you mention using a chipped Amex I dont think that would be your problem. I do think this is a major reason why Walmart and Home Depot arent yet requiring chip transactions if you swipe a chipped card it will go through its supposed to tell you to insert the card in the chip slot. Walmart was enforcing this last year but turned it off as the holiday shopping season got underway I assume because they didnt want the problems with debit cards to slow down that busy shopping time. I suspect debit card issues might also have been one reason Home Depot didnt meet their end of  deadline. I also once talked to a store manager who said that they meant end of their  fiscal year which meant February  but they didnt meet that deadline either.I think a major reason were seeing the big chain stores being so slow to roll this out is that they have complex integrated point of sale systems that require software changes to support chip cards. While small places like that Mexican restaurant basically just have to replace their credit card terminal with a new one and theyre good to go.The liability shift deadline when merchants will assume liability for fraud if they swipe a chipped card is October . I think well see most of the major chains switch on their chip support over the summer and early fall as we approach October. ,chipcards,crkh079,3,t5_33kh7

He talks about an unpredictable number presumably this is part of the tap interface and not the magnetic stripe which is fixed data? He also talks a lot about legacy modes. For tap does this mean getting rid of MSD contactless and supporting only EMV contactless?,chipcards,ctzjd8n,1,t5_33kh7

Im with the card companies on this one. The rest of the world moved on and these retailers are holding us back. ,chipcards,cvl4q34,1,t5_33kh7
