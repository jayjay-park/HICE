3316875,0,t3_2y2z63,With all this talk about mix tapes game jams and indie labels we were having for the past few days I came up with a cool metaphor for the idea the community has come up with here.A game jam is like a music jam an indie developer label is like a music label and what we have here is like a street performance with a free mix tape at the end.The developers jam along in a thread and a passerby can throw a tip if they like what they see and in the end theres a bundle of games to take with you home.Im really excited about this! Cant wait to see how the first one goes!,IndieDev,cp6co7h,2,t5_2t1dz

3348135,0,t1_cp9t7in,There are a lot!  It is very expensive to make a game.  Programmers are expensive and so are designers.  Lucky for Team Frizz we have both on the team working pro bono!,IndieDev,cp9wvj3,1,t5_2t1dz

3835609,0,t1_cqsxtd3,When Im not busy attempting to sleep before yet another long day of work Ill fill you in. Weve finished two visual novels the second being much more successful than the first.All freeware.Ill probably post a self post here talking about conventional gaming versus what we do and how we are different than a lot of studios at least we hope we are something different PTomorrow I shall!,IndieDev,cqthr54,1,t5_2t1dz

4749751,0,t3_3fxazf,I think we should be good. As long as the devs partake on discussion on the site somewhat regularly and dont spam their game constantly it shouldnt be breaking the rules when the Dev posts their game here or on another gaming related subreddit. ,IndieDev,ctt927d,1,t5_2t1dz

5446476,0,t1_cw7sf2c,Yeah I did just check your post history and noticed you did some stuff on it. Even if it doesnt quite get much recognition here its still good to document all of this in case you need to reference anything later also good for people looking for ideas for their own mech games.,IndieDev,cw7u8pm,2,t5_2t1dz
5456158,0,t1_cw927am,thanks! great feedback! since it is a teaser it isnt supposed to be a full trailer that talks about the game just yet!. this is all wonderful feedback as I will definitely remember this for the next teaser and the final trailer!,IndieDev,cw92qrd,0,t5_2t1dz
5942597,0,t1_cxvm2qw,Thanks. We were editing out scenes left and right to make it shorter. Good thing well have more footage for further and most likely shorter vids.,IndieDev,cxylrnc,1,t5_2t1dz

6132680,0,t1_cymnza1,gt The developers of the right at any time without giving any reason terminate your access to the server to a specific user or subnet as a whole.People thinks they own things .. this rule apply for EVERYTHING !You pay to have a right to USE a thing not to own it. your OS smartphone software and etc. they can all be like nope you stop here I wont let you use my software for no reason. They can they just wont do it without any good reason because it gives bad feedback.,IndieDev,cympzei,2,t5_2t1dz

7016233,0,t1_d1bmjl6,At the end of the video I demonstrate the editorbalancing heres a screenshot of the editor.I know the UI is confusing so heres what youre looking atThe first column of numbers with the top being the fighter name are the stats.  Each stat has an upper and lower bound.  For example walking speed cannot be higher than  or lower than .The second column of numbers is your fighter points.  Currently you are allotted  fighter points to distribute to your fighter and its moves any way you see fit.  The top cell highlighted in yellow is how many fighter points you have remaining.  Each stat contributes to fighter points linearly.  For example for each stun stat you add to a move it subtracts . fighter points from the total.The third column of numbers only in the move section are the move points.  This number starts at  and must remain positive.  Certain stats contribute to this number in a positive way and others in a negative way and not all linearly.  For example both damage and size use the formula damage x size   to calculate their move points.  This basically forces the player to counter balance an OP move with stats that are considered bad startup frames and recovery frames.I really like your idea of a special way to break some of these constraints.  I was thinking of giving each move the possibility of an ability.  This could be a dash attack teleport poison and to your point stat breaker.  The cool think about developing browser games is I can push out updates very easily after release especially to add new features or fix broken balancing.editAlso each fighter has  moves.   ground and  jump.

8370176,0,t3_4u8xea,You could create a gameObject in the first scene and call dontDestroyOnLoad on it to make it persist. Then you can use that object to store static data necessary for generating a menu at the start of each scene. UI scripting reference,IndieDev,d5ntlud,1,t5_2t1dz

9108791,0,t3_551kfp,Ive always wanted to learn how to develop a game but between my computer science course and a fulltime job I never had the drive to actually put my focus on something.About two months and a half ago on my birthday I know it sounds cheesy but I swear its true a friend of a friend contacted me he needed a programmer for a few game ideas that he had and he was willing to wait for me to learn.  We began our collaboration a couple of months ago and this video captures what we achieved so far.  Its not much but Im proud of it.All the D footage you see is captured in game no postprocessing involved whatsoever. We are planning to add more weapons levels and enemies and most of the items ingame wont be static but will be damaged and eventually broken.If you wish you can support us on Kickstarter and Steam GreenlightWe are trying our luck on Kickstarter because with an increased initial budget we will be able to afford to concentrate a little less on our daily jobs and pour more time and energy into the game.We are always open to feedback suggestions criticism and of course praise!,IndieDev,d86qa39,3,t5_2t1dz
9240818,0,t1_d8n9j4t,Well... We are three brothers and weve always loved video games and weve set up shop in a shack. Neither of us knew anything about making video games when we started. With the help of youtube and forums weve managed learn enough to make The Steamers. We really strive to make something different. We always used to talk about how much better a game could be if it had this or that. We never really found the ultimate video game so were giving it our best shot. ,IndieDev,d8nca3c,5,t5_2t1dz

9991488,0,t1_db9w02p,mm are  degrees. When games have a small fov they are in the  degrees range.You can view any film content of any ratio fov or whatever from any distance and you will not have a problem. Whoever told you that they do this to match real world fov from that distance is bullshitting you the same way they call  fps cinematic.What I explain is demonstratively true more fov more stuff in view.What you say is something I have seen no studio fret on or even consider.Edit How is it better from far away to have to do large rotations to figure out where you are or to see what you want to see?

10916127,0,t1_de5ws8e,Not at all. Im not saying that this is the only correct interpretation of my game but it is the one I intended. Ultimately art is in the eye of the beholder and the artist is as much of a beholder of their own art as anyone else.If the point of the game is to convey a meaning or narrative then this does not defeat the point. In fact if anything it aids the point to a certain degree as the meaning becomes immediately accessible to anyone. The only detriment to selfanalysis is that it implies that no other interpretations exist which I do not believe to be true. On a somewhat more pragmatic note my audience is small enough that statistically itd be very surprising if anyone who has seen or played it has also taken the time to peel apart its contents. ,IndieDev,de5x6ga,1,t5_2t1dz
