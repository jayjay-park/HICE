Its amazing what the entourage can do with you. I remember when I stumbled upon a very dubious forum entitled AllTheFallen... wow that was some fucked up stuff. Luckily I stuck to the loli threads a little less squirky and cringe educing but it did take its toll on my sanity for better or worse. Its amazing what the internet can to do you until you learn to accept it and join in the madness. And no matter how much you pretend not to be sick yourself deep inside you know you are because you see madness as you know is like gravity. All it takes is a little push! So embrace it accept it for what it is vent it out when you can not to allow it to consume you completely. But beware you might end up becoming the mask. I havent gotten that far... yet. Although rereading my comments... Im getting close Damn too high on the moe must break free! Help!

3712043,0,t1_cqf96vl,Were talking best character not best skilled. Makos low blood sugar causing laziness and inability to get up in the mornings just adds to her greatness. How blunt and straightforward she is all the time also adds to her flawless character shes not obnoxiuously loud and only speaks when necessary like bringing Saori back down to reality after she gets too excited and Mako just shits on her fun like when she was learning how to use a radio and thought she sound pro Mako just shuts her down hard. Its like that throughout the whole series because Makos rare addition to dialogue are always hilarious.As for ability sure Carpaccio has no medical conditions holding herself back which allows her to perform at her full  unfortunately thats the same as Makos . After taking a short nap as per protocol Mako goes back to full potential and never sleeps during the actual tournament anyway so when it matters shes working at her full flawless ability and when it doesnt matters shes being fucking great and sleeping. The only time she has slept in a match is in the training match between Ooarai and St. Gloriana but only while Miho and Yukari were scouting for British tanks and Mako woke up immediately when she was needed.And a costume doesnt make someone super? No but having flawless skill and ability does and her character fights crime in that OVA too so shes a super hero. Also shes not wearing hockey pads.,GIRLSundPANZER,cqfecab,2,t5_2v1d5

4172204,0,t1_crvmcno,Craftable mean that you can put resources into the construction of ship girls. The mechanics of the game seem pretty detached from the subject matter. Like how do you build a humanish girl with ship cannons using ammo fuel steel and bauxite? And why is the result semirandom?The only logical explaination is magic. Fairy magic. Theres little people in the game called fairies. Theres no story in the game but there are various takes on the background of the game from various fan artists. The theory which I subscribe to is one that takes heavily from the Shinto religion in Japan. Basically from their use in the war the warships attained souls just like old items that see frequent use are considered to do. These souls were split in two. One soul is resentful and know nothing but anger hate and war. They became the abyssals which are the enemies in the game. The other soul is the kind side which knows love and fights to defend. In modern times these souls have resurrected in the form of shipgirls. Also there are fairies which are basically the souls of the crew. I assumed this understanding of the KanColle universe after reading this post  and this comic  The comic tries to explain game mechanics through a premise like that which Ive explained here.Other theories are that they are real girls born with the souls of warships or real girls imbued with the souls of warships. Some theories have the game actually take place during WW but with girls instead of warships.Even before I played I often found KanColle references and comics. They are highly enjoyable even if you arent familiar with the game mechanics though mostly its better to know the mechanics. The characters are just very lovable and the cast is huge! There was recently an anime released. It doesnt do a very good job with its story but its a good watch none the less. The main character is one of the starter ships you can choose from when you first join the game.,GIRLSundPANZER,crvu77q,6,t5_2v1d5

Answer me he said with a shaky voice. John remained calm. I said Thats what I get for bothering with her he replied.Maus punched him square in the gut. Sebastien and George watched. They tried not to intervene since it was like a tiger about to eat his prey... even if Maus was only a tad bit more muscular than the three of them.Oh you bothered with her? Yeah just a fucking fling huh? Shes a person too. She doesnt like you. So if she doesnt like you dont fucking kiss her.What are you some kind of neckbeard white knight?

7410433,0,t3_4gsxgs,Im Falkerz from Englandia The UK and at times I spend  hours shouting at my PC. As for the show gosh darn gee wilikers its a regular hit for my mechanical warfare love. Tanks are one of the greatest vehicles to ever be created simply because they can do almost anything. I especially like the unique things for suspension track design armour layering etc. You know everything about tanks really even if I dont know that much yet being stupidly busy with other things.Characterswise I am most relateable to Mako due to my immense difficulty with waking up my constant need to eat sugary things dont appear to be diabetic  have low blood pressure though and rather unnatural ability to be able to get behind the wheel of something and just kind of be able to drive it. Natural instinct. My favourite character is a harder nut to crack. Nonna is a special character simply because Russian is such a beautiful language and the Cossack Lullaby is a beautiful thing in of itself. Katyushas also pretty great given the song they sing about her is an actual Russian wartime  folk song. I can certainly see aspects of myself in Mihos tactical ability especially the multifaceted focus and incredibly rapid onthefly situational response. ...Uhm. Wat. Like WAT. I cant... That fucking voice for Kadotani. Couple with MoMos voice. I just cant... So fucking ace. But yeah Kadotani was gonna be listed as my favourite even before I got sidetracked by that trying to find a spelling for her name. Given that shes always eating gives no fucks and generally just wants to have fun. Oh and shes actually a decent leader.,GIRLSundPANZER,d2kin77,3,t5_2v1d5

Its backpedaling.gtWut? Sorry mate maybe its me but Im not sure if I have correctly understood what you said.Im calling bullshit on your claims that Cariuss unit never faced a single breakdown. Given that Carius was active in panzer battalions from  where once again the Tiger had a  operational rate this is completely farfetched. Later when he was in charge of a Tiger II battalion well guess what? Tiger IIs by  had a  operational rate and the earlier ones where worse with multiple units reporting poor reliability  of the first  Tiger IIs to reach Panzer Lehr Division worked on arrival and and the st Heavy Panzer Battalion when it reformed on the Eastern Front reported  out of  Tiger IIs operational on arrival. Thats .. So basically I call bullshit that Carius never once had a breakdown in any of his battalions.AlsogtNo one here is saying that no Tiger had ever breakdowns but they werent so common eitherThirty. Six.

11623875,0,t1_dgddo9y,gt And you tell me that reddit isnt a font of tankies ripping on German tanks. PYou havent been here as much as the rest of us. Ive personally seen  wehraboos for every tankie. Plus Kaptens not a tankie.Russian tanks had issues not because of design like the Germans but because of quality control. You can improve on QA on design not as much. As for the Brits I know they had their own issues the Army having less funds than the RN and RAF among others I still think the Germans take the cake when it comes to unreliability with their big cats. But in the end thats not the issue. The issue is that more often than not its the German tanks that are glorified which in turn eventually leads to them being bashed by people who realise theyre being overglorified. Its a vicious circle that started with the German tank superiority myth.,GIRLSundPANZER,dgdkt3w,1,t5_2v1d5
11626720,0,t3_65wbar,Favorite?! Favourite for you British blokes out there one does not simply pick a favorite! I really enjoyed the Porsche Tiger. One of those unique and ingenious ideas that was just to advanced for its time. Now i am uncertain if it was the version with the extra elephantFerdinand armor but personally i think it was. However i found it funny that despite kourmarine having German tanks they didnt know about the hull mounted mg weakspot. That would have made taking out lapoon team in the championships much easier I was also disappointed that the electric engines were not really taken advantage of. They technically were when they were modded in der film but never the advantage i thought would be very beneficial. That being that it has the same reverse speed as it does forward. Yet whenever lapoon  team is seen retreating its rear toward the enemy  i guess the driver having to see is important  but thats what the commander is for imoI thought it was cool to see the kv in action. The explosions were cool to.The Italian tanks were nice to see as well. Despite the tankettes being impracticable Anzio was the only school to exploit any fast maneuverable tanks.  The other schools just used a steel wall of heavy and medium armor. I thought it would have been cool to see some pumas stuarts and Chaffees i know in der film they were used but only to Scout or to attack anzio never to flank and spankAnd last but not least the hetzer! Because hetzer is gonna hetz!On a side note i just realised that is the championship match vs kourmarine that them flanking through the forest unexpectedly is a historical reference to Germany going around Tyne Maginot line in WWII.

Its not so much the loss of Moscow as the loss of him that might have been crippling. Moreover Moscow was a vital hub of infrastructure  it connected a massive proportion of Western Russias rail lines and still does and its loss would be crippling much as Rzhevs loss to Army Group Centre was  prompting the Rzhev meat grinder offensives to reclaim it.There actually isnt that much scholarship I can find that is more recent and agrees with your point. The most I can find is a more recent  Jentz and Doyle book having traced it back through the references in Ogorkiewiczs book from last year.The Tiger II was slow and fairly cumbersome theres no getting round that but for its comparative size and weight it was still moderately mobile yknow if you could get the damn thing running.
