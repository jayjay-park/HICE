160272,0,t1_cewoh0y,gt Why do you need a gun magsWell one magazine goes in the gun and one is a spare. Glocks are very reliable firearms but magazine failure is the number one cause of failure on just about any gun. I carry a gun backpacking for the same reason I carry everything else in that kit. Its a tool. It gives me the ability to protect myself primarily against wildlife and to a lesser extent other people. Its definitely one of those things Id rather have and not need than need and not have.gt  knivesAs stated in my OP I dont necessarily carry everything at the same time. The Leatherman I carry on me every day so if I went hiking Id probably drop one or even both of my folders. But Im not sure where youre getting the six figure from? I have a folding saw arguably much more useful for building firesshelter than a hatchet and certainly far lighter a fixed blade knife two folding knives and a multitool. Thats four knives and a saw. The fixed blade is great for survival but hardly something I carry on a day trip. The top of the pack detaches to form a separate day pack for foragingshort day hikes so I like to keep one of the folders in there. I keep the other in the medical kit. gt a pair of scissorsEver tried cutting clothing off of a person who was seriously injured using a pocket knife? EMT shears are very effective at that as well as cutting open packaging or cutting moleskin down to size or whatever. They are hardly a singleuse tool.gt  flashlightsHeadlamp for lowlight handsfree stuff like setting up camp or taking a late night piss. One small AA flashlight in the main bag. One small AA flashlight in the medical kit. A lantern for the tent. Thats four lights. Unless youre counting the two small LEDs built in to the battery charging packs. Those are hardly proper light sources for anything.I could certainly elect to lose the spare knife and light in the med kit as those items are fully redundant. The thing is though that if I were in a situation where I needed that kit and there have been a few times that have been pretty serious only once while hiking but Ive been witness to several rural vehicle accidents I dont have time to dig around through the main pack to grab those spare items. Its pretty much get the med kit and go. And when Im soloing the lantern is superfluous but with my girlfriend its nice to hang in the tent if we are playing cards or something. We like to hike year round an the weather up here can get pretty nasty in the winter and spring meaning lots of down time in the tent.gt and a costco pack of batteriesI dont have that many batteries. Basically every device has batteries in it and I have a set of spares for those devices fully charged. Those batteries and that solar panel are also responsible for charging my phone  used as an eReader music device and camera when hiking and my girlfriends GPS headlamp and flashlight. ,CampingandHiking,cewos5n,19,t5_2qqom
163206,0,t1_cewypqa,I figured thats how you would carry it which makes a lot of sense and I agree it would be completely useless if you kept it unloaded or in your pack. But I would point out that it does seem you are intending to bring violence to the trail despite the fact that it may be justified violence.I did not know that about Glocks but it makes sense that you would want a gun that cannot misfire if your taking it backpacking. I still think it would be safer to have it in a locked box at night. I know Ive slept through a partner getting in and out of the tent. I can tell we are just going to agree to disagree on this. But you should consider that if you ever want to do a more social hike like the AT most people myself included will not want to hike anywhere near a stranger with a gun. ,CampingandHiking,cex0sh0,1,t5_2qqom

259845,0,t1_cf7o8az,Also look at the NOC for summer jobs it sounds like you live nearby.The camp I worked for was up in the north east but at various points I was a backpacking instructor climbing instructor and white water instructor.  I spent about  days a month in camp and was usually out of camp  or  nights a week.  Pretty much out doing something every day and nearly every night.  I dont remember the names of any camps in your area I High Rocks sounds kind of familiar and is in Brevard.  Memory is foggy but I think I had some friends who worked their as climbing staff.  I would probably just do some googling for camps there are a lot that focus on or at least have an outdoor rec program.I currently live in western NC still in the outdoor industry but in the office side of things.  Personally this works better for me as I enjoy what I do and who I work with but have a more concrete schedule and much more time in the real world to spend with friends and family.  Being out in the woods for   or more weeks at a time doesnt leave much time for a family other hobbies or too many friends outside of your employer.  On the other hand I know people who have been doing field work for years and years and wouldnt change a thing.  Different strokes.  I still sometimes wish and might pursue it at some point that I had stuck with some kind of teaching but probably just doing day trips for a nature center or some kind of environmental education.

282821,0,t3_1xb365,I just spent two years minus the winter where we lived in Ottawa traveling from Vancouver to Newfoundland and back again. We lived in a van most of the time but tried to incorporate as many hikes as we possible could into our adventure. We had a very limited budget for food.We had a one burner white gas stove that we could take hiking if we were going for long enough. We had a frying pan and a medium sized cooking pot while hiking we would take the cooking pot if necessary. The following food worked for us while living out of the van. The van would always be stocked with a variety of dried nuts and fruit. Long drives and no food can make you crazy. Ramen with an egg or veggies dropped in  Egg wraps.  Beans and rice with chili pepper. Pasta Salad Pasta Chickpeas canned tomatoes olives Fried pepperoni wraps cheap pepperoni sausage tastes awesome if fried and it can last a few meals.  TunaChicken Salad Wraps Wed buy the canned tuna or chicken if on sale.  Canned Chili with rice and avocado. Bean wraps with whatever veg and sauces we had around. Granola wed buy soy milk in tetra packs. Sometimes wed add fruit or nuts.  Fire roasted hot dogs. Fire roasted perogies. Oatmeal though I got sick of it pretty quick and we stopped.While hiking we would buy ziplock bags and premake a bunch of dried meals. Along with our dried meals wed bring several items for snacking nuts dried raisins dried pepperoni. We discovered pretty quick that some snack items can also be great additions to the dried meals. For example I could slice up the dried pepperoni and add it to my pasta meal.  Wed usually make one or a few of the following Chicken noodle soup orzo chicken stock poultry seasoning salt and pepper. Curried Lentils split red lentils curry powder ricewe added dried mango a few times and that added some flavor. Chili Pasta orzo sundried tomato chili powder saltwed add some dried pepperoni before cooking.

Its entirely dependent on where you live and what product youre wanting to buy. Retailers are restricted by the agreements they have with vendors as to where they can sell amp ship their goods. If there are retailers in Canada which a company has good ties with theyre not going to mess with that relationship by allowing others from overseasacross borders to sell amp ship there instead possibly undermining their partners in your area. Often export restrictions will be listed on the product description page for each item but if you want to find out for sure whether itd be possible for you to buy amp have something shipped across the border to you call Direct Sales customer service .  Alternatively if youre anywhere near a border many members from up north opt to have items shipped to businesses located at border towns which receive amp hold their items for them to come south for retrieval.

513420,0,t3_2003zq,I just want to thank everyone that came in before me and so diligently answered this question.  Those of us who go camping and enter the wilderness on our own we are shepherds of the outdoors and we are responsible for preserving and protecting the places we visit.  The reason fires are not allowed is not because it is a rule of the man it is because there is a high risk of danger and there is no one to call to act quickly enough in an emergency.  I hope after reading these responses you make the responsible decision and take the time to educate yourself on how to be warm without having a fire.  Theres plenty of tips here but what is most important is that you will learn to go places that you would never go before by doing this without a fire.  If you are truly scared I suggest camping near your car and hiking out if you become comfortable.  If you do start a fire and if any other hikers see you you will get a similar response to the people answering in this thread and it wont be nice.  Good luck and please let us know how you do.,CampingandHiking,cfymngv,5,t5_2qqom

You should get a weather report before you trip but you should be doing that before any trip.  Polyester performs okay but it is the worst smelling fabric by far.  It should be okay for an overnighter but youll learn to hate polyester if you have to wear it for a few days.Nylon smells much less than polyester but theres not much stretchy nylon fabric if any.  I like it though since it doesnt snag on thorns.Wool smells the least or at least has the least offensive smell.  It still snags its very expensive relatively and it wears out faster.  If budget isnt a big factor then you should give wool a shot.,CampingandHiking,cg16j6u,3,t5_2qqom
544126,0,t1_cg23w2k,I consider ultralight to be a trickledown technology. The crazier outdoorsy people can try the experimental products and the companies learn what works and what didnt work.

544615,0,t1_cg239w0,If I know Im going to be moving hard in bad weather I too just go with something windresistant and keep the dry stuff in my bag to change into.   I spend a lot of time taking people out and a lot of that time is spend on easy trails so my poncho gets a lot of use on broad belowtreeline areas. It is useful for a much smaller percentage of my personal trips.  If you have a drink mix thats a great argument for bottles. I only ever drink straight water but my husband takes water in a bladder and drink mix in a bottle.  I also use filters for water meaning that I dont need to refill the bladder directly.  On some trips I bring a Nalgene which I use as a hot water bottle but I too want a second container and I bring the bladder rather than another bottle.   Im the kind of person who likes to drink less more frequently. I always have a bottle of water on hand and in a typical sedentary day of work or at home would rarely go more than  minutes without drinking. So for me the first time I tried a bladder it was the most amazing thing I had ever tried and Ill chose to take it for its awesomeness even with other things being far more practical. Because I like it so much I will use a bladder unless it completely doesnt work for me only extreme cold has brought that.  But I dont think there is a right way for water. I really think in that area every option is on pretty even ground and it just depends on the person.  ,CampingandHiking,cg26gvr,2,t5_2qqom

562593,0,t3_20jxwx,It really depends on what youll be carrying and for how long. Often on what youll be doing while carrying it. Then sprinkle in some personal preference.As several people have noted try renting first since packs can get expensive.Height is only loosely connected to pack size. Torso length is more important. At  you may fall into the grey area between a Regular and a Long torso. You could also be built for a Short torso. So definitely get fitted somewhere any outfitter can help with that. Im built kinda strange where I need a Long torso and Small hip belt so Im limited to packs with interchangeable belts.For manufacturers it really just depends on how much you want to spend and what your requirements are. The only manufacturer I would avoid are Mountainsmith I question their durability. Osprey and Gregory make great packs for someone who is just starting out. And its tough to beat the Osprey lifetime warranty. ArcTeryx REI Deuter Black Diamond and Granite Gear are other common manufacturers and Ive seen quality packs produced by all of them.My local Moosejaw store has been great about bringing in different packs for me to try on free of charge.,CampingandHiking,cg4811w,3,t5_2qqom

It will stop the bleeding but when the person gets to the ER for later treatment they have to literally cut the powder from the wound opening it up again and making it worse. Granted it might have stopped the bleeding in a life threatening situation but long term if used in minor wounds it leads to a lot more damage and scaring. The vast majority of bleeding can be stopped with direct pressure.  The implication of the article as nothing else is listed in the first aid baggie Your other baggies seem much more complete. other than this We pack a folded SAM splint and clotting powder in our first aid baggie along with nail clippers try removing a hangnail with a Leatherman.... is that this will take care of every injury accidentemergency you might encounter on the trail.I would think some guaze bandages tape OTC medications would be much more important than nail clippers but I guess I have never suffered a nail emergency on the trail. lolYour intent might be good however starting your site with flat out bad information is not a good beginning.,CampingandHiking,cggicwx,1,t5_2qqom

1150851,0,t3_27aks0,I own a biolite trangia and a snow peak gigapowerI would likely use the trangia for backpacking trips since it is smaller and lighter for car camping the snow peak is far more convenient faster to boil water can simmer also the same canister of fuel can be used for my snow peak lantern The natural light is far easier on the eyes than all of the led lanterns and you can control brightness from extremely dim to a miniature sun.The biolight is more of a toy it is a hastle to constantly feed it fuel soft wood burns up in  minutes loose twigs etc even faster I tend to bring a huge bag of wood pellets they are stupid cheap and work well in the biolite.IMO Trangia or any alcohol stove is for backpacking when weight is an issueSnowpeak gigapower whisperlight etc are better all around stoves when weight is less of an issue and performance is key.Biolite is more of a emergency blackout natural disaster etc type of thing although when my Powerpot X arrives I will likely sell the biolite.,CampingandHiking,chz32cx,1,t5_2qqom

Flame apparently increases chance theyll secrete their bacteria into your skin and increases risk of lymesrocky mountain fever. Keep the tic. Vetsdocs in your area may be accepting them for research on diseaserisk assessment. Put it in a zip lock bag with a small piece of damp tissue to stop the tick from drying out. Then put that bag in another ziplock bag.Keep an eye on the area as well make sure you dont get a bruiserash around it.Also drowning the tick off works well. Use a bottle cap or something similar.

1287420,0,t3_28tngp,My impressions of this trail are its quite a good little advanced trail for Indiana. Its the most rugged challenging trail Ive ever been on. It climbs and drops hundreds of feet pretty much the entire trail. Not sure if thats the calling card of a good trail designer or not but if you want a good challenge this is a great way to go. I got the impression that the trail doesnt see a lot of love it was overgrown in many many places and of course the plants overtaking the trail are all thorny. Lots of raspberries might be worth it in season but nothing but green seeds in June. Even the very last  miles of the trail that connected to a road and campground were overgrown it had just rained so my bright and early final miles to the car were soaking wet due to the leaves touching me. With the huge tick problem they have perhaps cutting back the trail would help hikers a bit. The problem is so bad though I dont think anything short of napalm would take care of the ticks.I read several reviews that said water was not to be found within the park. This is only mostly true there is a clean water faucet about  feet north of the trail. This is the horsemans camp you can fill up bladders all day long here. The problem is this is only one part of the trail and its pretty easy to get to by road so its more likely your starting and ending point then a tough middle when you actually might need water. Still I wish I would have known it would have helped me a bit. The rest of the trail is BONE DRY. You will pass through countless ravines without so much as a drop of water in them. Its actually mind boggling how dry this area is. I cached water at the halfway point carried in  liters and planned on filtering out of the Ohio River at camp . The problem is when I got to camp the Ohio was over  mile away down a  degree mountain. On my map and GPS it looked close but it was extremely far extremely dangerous and you know really hard to climb up and down a mountain. So I got to the river filled my dirty water bladder filtered it then refilled it. This gave me  liters to get to my water cache  miles away. The only problem was I was dehydrated and I drank  liters instantly. Thats when I noticed the plastic buckets filled with dirty rain water and mosquito larvae. I pondered it for a long long time and eventually I knew I needed water and the trip to the river was out so I filtered another  liters and well Im writing this reviews so my filter works fine. Tasted pretty woody though. When I got to the next shelter house there were buckets under the eaves as well full of water so this is obviously a known trick used here. If youre not squeamish go for it its doable and saves you a ton of weight. I got through to my cache filled both of my bladders with clean clear tasty well water from my house and this got me through the next  miles where the horsemans camp faucet is.  liters was plenty to get there and once I filled up my bottle and cooked dinner I knew I only needed a bit of water to reach my car  miles away so I filled up  bladder and went to bed.The forest is a crazy thing its really over grown I guess thats a function of timber cutting they cut out the tall trees and this lets lower brush grow but this seemed to stifle all wind in the park. It was  degrees in the shade for a full  hours on me it was horrible. Even my campsite up on top of a mountain was surrounded by so much undergrowth there was no breeze. I laid asleep in my tent with the rain fly pulled back sweating until am when the air temp finally dropped. I didnt expect that it seems very unusual maybe I was just there in a no wind time.There are  really nice shelters built right on the trail and another dirt floored shack. The problem with these is that they are all fairly close together. The first is about  miles from the road the second  the dirt shack is another  then the final shelter is another . Then you cover  or  miles and arrive at the campground where there is supposedly another shelter. When I arrived here my plan was to camp for the night but the area had no shelter no signs to a shelter and no obvious trails out. This was a rare intersection of several trails so I opted to leave the AHT and see if another trail would take me out. It did not and somehow miraculously it found its way around a ridge and joined back up with the AHT. No idea how or why but I gave up and kept on going with the intentions of striking camp in the woods as soon as I found level ground. After about  miles I noticed I was coming up on the south side of the same campground so I kept going and at this point I could see the horse trailers and there were about  trails connecting the campgrounds to the trail so I picked one and set up camp in an unused trailer spot. This gave me access to a picnic table to avoid ticks on the ground. I think they could do well make that last shelter a bit easier to find then maybe create  or  new ones in the northern part of the trail it seems a little lacking to me. Normally I dont care but in tick infested woods that picnic table is invaluable for keeping the dog out of the grass and me off the ground.Most areas are well blazed a combination of trees painted x posts with either paint or a sticker or fiberglass trail markers. There are very very few intersections and when you find one its always a  wide horse trail so its easy to stick to the AHT. There were lots and lots of obstructions some of the work arounds were more established than the trail itself so it looks like they dont worry about fixing the trail up. Thats disappointing but most of the time it was fine. There were several times that the trail was so obstructed the work around was very long and then the trail was hard to pick back up but a little sleuthing always found a blaze. The blazes were extremely abundant if they cut back on them at all I probably would have gotten lost a dozen times.Not sure how to finally wrap this up Im glad I did it but I cant see any circumstance where I would willingly go hike it again. Its just mile after mile of the same hilly forest view. Any amazing scenic view of the Ohio River Valley is obstructed by trees and vines and aside from a few dry creek beds there isnt much to look at. My calves are feeling it now so Im glad for an awesome workout and I certainly learned a few things but it was not an entirely enjoyable trail. Thank god the last  miles were downhill gotta give them credit for that.,CampingandHiking,cieg8xo,2,t5_2qqom

1554067,0,t1_cjas6zw,I disagree. For backpacking you dont want your waterproof shell and insulation to be in the same piece. Layers are the way to goa nonwaterproof insulating midlayer down or synthetic and then a separate waterproofbreathable shell. This way you can wear the shell in bad weather and still hike without overheating remember sweat is very very very bad.You could use this system for snowboarding although you may want to stick with synthetic insulation for that purpose. Another way to tackle it would be to get one waterproofbreathable shell to use for both then get a lightweight down midlayer for backpacking and a synthetic midlayer for snowboarding.,CampingandHiking,cjb2qn6,1,t5_2qqom

If it really did get up into the s during the day Id be sweating balls hiking in long layers no matter thermoregulating and moisturewicking they claim to be.They might be fine as dedicated sleepwear if you didnt mind carrying the extra bulk but if you really are expecting a temperature range that goes up that high Id stick with short base layers at least during the day.As long as your sleeping bag is good enough to handle the lows the coldest youre going to be is getting up first thing in the morning. But once you get up and get a hot drink into you and break camp youll probably only want a midweight top over your base layer by the time you start out hiking for the day.,CampingandHiking,ckcfpmj,5,t5_2qqom

This was a long time ago so all my navigation was map and compass so thats a good way to occupy your brain. I had a one match per day rule so getting a fire going in the rain took more planning which is a great distraction. In fact the whole trip was geared to one trip portages one pack and one canoe no return trips so my gear was pretty minimal which can add another layer of fun to your days. I cant camp like that now Im too soft. I was a beast tripper then a km portage was nothing and I ran most of it. When youre busy all day and evening you dont miss company that much.

I had a liter of water with me.  Luckily a guy came by in a jeep and towed me back.  Since then even if Im in a vehicle I keep enough water to do a significant hike when Im in remote desert areas.The second time was just careless.  I had done this hike before and there was a little trickle of running water at the bottom of a wash.  So I brought long a water filter to refill when I got to that point.  Of course the water was gone the next time and I was already  through my water.

3020417,0,t3_2urm47,I did that with some friends several years back over spring break.  Biggest issue is water obviously.  Not sure if conditions have improved much since  but Dodson spring was the only spring that hadnt dried up on that loop including boot springs.  We went clockwise spending night  in juniper canyon in the dispersed area night two a couple miles before homer Wilson ranch and night  at back country site SW I think. That site was recommended by a ranger and had a fantastic view of the sunset but was pretty exposed if wind is in the forecast.  We started off with . gallons apiece with the plan if reaching Dodson halfway through day .  We decided to get the southern and potentially hot Dodson trail out of the way in one somewhat leisurely day. So we left juniper canyon at  am and hiked into the best sunrise Ive ever seen and reached Dodson spring around  maybe. We then took a long break sort of exploring the area enjoying some shade and pounding as much water as possible before continuing on.  We hiked past sunset until we found a flat spot to sleep.  Next morning we picked up our only water cache by homer wilson ranch and took a bit too much time hanging out before starting the hike up blue creek canyon as it got hotter.  Weather was nice so we didnt need too many layers but definitely bring the sunscreen.  Going up to Emory peak is worthwhile since theres a place for backpackers to stash their packs before the last couple hundred feet.  You can probably get by without a shelter since you probably wont see rain or bugs we didnt use anything but a groundsheet the whole trip.  ,CampingandHiking,cob2avt,3,t5_2qqom

If you start now you can find gear between now and April.rbevans remarked that you should get a hiking stick or a trekking pole.  I absolutely recommend trekking poles.  They are a must.  Those poles will make all the difference between a great hike and a painful one.  I found some great Leki poles brand new on Craigslist for  but you dont really need to go namebrand.  Get springloaded poles if you can.  Day  you will thank yourself.Do get a selfinflating ground pad.  Those little thin mats the ultralight guys use take some getting used to.  You actually have to learn to sleep on those you train yourself to ignore the pain in your body and stay prone.

There are very very very few mountain lion attacks on humans in continental north america and very very many hikers and campers. Odds are youll never see a mountain lion in your entire life. Were not their natural prey.Those attacks that do happen usually do so because we trigger a predatory response by passing under them or running away.  Stand still make yourself big shout and yell jab sticks or throw stones at them dont act like prey.Twice Ive seen mountain lions but once was up close and personal. I did pretty much everything wrong that day but got out of it with nothing more than a bout of shakes afterwards. The one thing that I got right was to not act like prey and the lion ran off.Part of being in the wilderness is understanding it. Thats one of the reasons that I brought my son with me on all of my hikes once he turned . He loved it and loves camping to this day hes  now and in college.

This is as simple as when you are cold your blood keeps your vital organs warmer and why your fingers and toes get cold.

3616905,0,t1_cq4iaz7,From your linkgt The BLM does not offer much land for sale because of a congressional mandate in  to generally retain these lands in public ownership. The BLM does however occasionally sell parcels of land where our land use planning finds disposal is appropriate.So while federal land does get sold it does not appear that that happens to a lot of land. And what Republicans in the Congress passed a nonbinding resolution I might add  nuance is to turn over much more federal public land to the states to do as they see fit. Many of those states  also run by Republicans generally  have been trying to force the federal governments hand to turn those lands over to them and given their platforms and policies it is not unthinkable to believe they would sell off many parks and other treasured public spaces. Many of them have said outright they intend to sell the land to reduce deficits. To me that seems like a shortterm fix to a longterm problem. But that gets into some messier discussions about taxes and the role of the federal government vs. states. I think the point we can all agree on is that those of us here do wish to see federal public land preserved for both us and future generations. Those are many of the places we can do dispersed camping and hiking opportunities. So while some rhetoric may sound like DNC talking points or whatever lets not let partisan differences get in the way of a common goal To preserve and protect public lands as much as possible. ,CampingandHiking,cq4jxbd,5,t5_2qqom

What you want to do is either shop amazon for the best deal you can find or find a local manufacturer or purveyor who might be willing to donate.   Donations are easier to acquire if your organization is a registered charity in your state.

3985276,0,t3_3631tz,I would try to get into the northern end of the Dolly Sods.  Take the Bear Rocks Trail to the Ravens Ridge Trail.  If you can get all the way to the Rocky Ridge Trail that is where the best scenery is plenty of bogs to the south and east of the ridge and some nice views out over the valley to the west.  Judging from the map itd be about  miles round trip to Rocky Ridge and back which is a little bit more than youre looking for but by starting at the northern end of the wilderness anyways youd be avoiding the elevation gains if you came in from the south.Lions Head looks like it is about  miles round trip form the Red Creek Trailhead and it does involve a fair amount of climbing.  It is worth visiting if you ever get the chance though.Its also nice to just casually stroll along Red Creek and enjoy the scenery in the valley.  The first . miles of the Red Creek trail are extremely flat.  There is some nice campsites along the way that could make excellent lunch destinations.One thing to keep in mind is that in order to preserve the challenges of wilderness navigation all trails in the Dolly Sods are unmarked with the exception that there are signs at most of the trail junctions.  Usually the trails arent difficult to follow but there are some places where they become obscured.  Make sure you bring a map and compass and know how to use them.  ,CampingandHiking,crak2bc,1,t5_2qqom

4598425,0,t1_ct9q92m,I recently picked up one of those knock off jet boil stove and the primus fuel that you have. The problem I came across was that while I was screwing in the stove gas would be released heavily between the stove and the fuel before the rubber o ring could even block it. Have you encountered this problem before?Update I seriously appreciate all of the replies! I figured I would give it one more try since it appeared to be common trait in working stoves. All I did was screw the stove into the the fuel without applying any pressure to help secure the stove. This allowed the stove to screw the oring closer to the seal on the fuel before the pin on the stove could open the fuel source. There was some hissing but minimal leakage.

4815277,0,t1_cu1cxkt,Permanent bans often exist because people in the past werent careful about minimizing campfire impacts.  Here in NY there is a permanent ban in effect in the Eastern High Peaks Wilderness which is probably one of the most popular backcountry camping destinations on the east coast.  High levels of use in the s and s lead to significant issues with a complete depletion of dead and down woody material over large areas along with rampant tree cutting and the state had no choice but to institute a permanent ban.  Since the ban went into effect there has been a significant change in the character of campsites within that particular wilderness area with a lot more young trees coming back in around the campsites.  As much as it can such not to be able to have them it is always important to remember that campfires in the backcountry are a privilege not a right.  Particularly in high use areas it is important to follow Leave No Trace with regards to fires keep them small in both size and duration use only wood that you can break up by hand use a camp stove for cooking instead and perhaps even make the choice willingly not to have one on some nights.  ,CampingandHiking,cu1i6zp,1,t5_2qqom

5424873,0,t1_cw501d3,Several suggestions come to mind to get you over this fear.First of all some form of relaxant helps.  It can be benadryl a shot of whiskey earbuds and soft musicwhite noise meditation whatever helps calm you down a bit.Soft foam earplugs can help too.  If you cant hear the noises its a lot easier to relax.Group campingdefinitely yes.  Its reassuring to be in a group and animals will stay clear of you.  Be aware though that theyll still be making noise and at night noise travels a long ways.  An owl may be  mile away and it still will sound like its right next to you. Education on this topic will help you get over the fear of the unknown.  Learn what animals are active in your area at night and what sounds they make.  Once you find out that the screech you heard is made by a bird smaller than a pigeon and that the leaves you heard rustling around is because of mice looking for food youll realize that those noises are harmless and can be safely ignored.Statistically you are in no real danger.  Animal attacks on people in tents are really rareso rare that they get reported on for just that reason.  Most animal attacks happen during hiking in the day and involve startling some critter.  At night animals may be interested in your food but definitely are not interested in you as food.  Humans are a threat that theyll stay away from and if you practice proper camping techniques involving your food stash theyre not going to come near you.,CampingandHiking,cw530y1,4,t5_2qqom

5739758,0,t1_cx8gccc,Okay so you want to get fully kitted for backpacking...    The only problem is that camping gear is generally less comfortable than car camping. If youll be car camping  of the time I would be concerned that you are going to pay for lightweight normally less durable gear when you dont really need it. Plus youll be in a smaller tent with a worse stove and other lacking conveniences for the  nights of a  month trip youll be in the backcountry. But Ill go with with you say...                   I posted this recently on exactly that topic  check it out                This is the REI backpacking checklist                     What do you think about that?        The Cabelas tent would not be ideal for backpacking. At lb oz it is a beast. Most lightweight backpacking tents will be less than  pounds.           That sleeping bag is over  pounds while the quilts I recommended are  each and pack WAY smaller. Quilts are just more comfortable all around. I would seriously reconsider that REI mummy bag.             Dont skimp on the sleeping pad. If you are going to be sleeping in a tent for  months  you want to be comfortable. Backpacking pads need to be compact to fit into a pack. I normally have a much bigger pad for car camping  but if you want to focus on backpacking this is going to be one big place youll compromise.        Simple backpacking stoves are great at boiling water not much else. To use this as a full time stove on a  month adventure  i would personally not be content. Just make sure to get one that you can adjust the temperature on well not a JetBoil for example.          Do you already have cookware and utensils planned? Pots can get heavybulky  so get something quality that wont burn up on your first pot of ramen. Long handle spoons are great for eating dehydrated backpacking meals.               Check into bear bags or bear canisters. Youll need to secure your food at night both when car camping and backpacking. One method is hanging it in a tree another is putting it all into a hard sided container and placing it far from camp.          Headlamps will probably be important. My favorite brand is Black Diamond.        I guess that Bass Pro pack is okay. Low quality for sure so I would not buy it  but it may get you through the hike. Ive never done Half Dome so I dont know whats required.         Gatorade bottles work fine for water transport while backpacking. Look at a Sawyer Squeeze or mini for water purification. Bladders are fine but I would save the money if you really wont be backpacking much.           You wont be able to choose a pack until you have the rest of your gear laid out. Iwe normally recommend to buy the backpack last. Mainly because you dont know how big it needs to be until you have your major items ready to go. Sleeping bag sleeping pad cooking equipment and clothes are the big ones. Normally L is the biggest I recommend. If you go cheap or want luxuries  maybe a L pack. Over that and youll be weighing yourself down with  pounds and it will be no fun. Generally speaking in season trips you dont want more than  pounds on your back each. The second complication of backpacks is that they all fit different. Like shoes  its best to try one on before you buy it. People are different sizes and different brands will be more comfortable than others. I can tell you top brands but thats about it. Look into Osprey Gregory and Arcteryx to get an idea of topshelf options.              In general I suggest to not shop at Bass Pro or Cabellas for backpacking equipment. They are geared towards the day hikers car campers and hunters. Youll need lightweight and quality gear for backpacking  so start to check out REI or other backpacking focused stores.            It does sound like you are unprepared and not understanding what this ordeal will be like. As long as you have enough money in the bank  you can always buy gear on the road. Plus Im sure youll be spending nights in hotels along the way  so that will give you relieve if unprepared.   ,CampingandHiking,cx8kmz1,1,t5_2qqom

5775446,0,t3_3u9d1t,What type of stove will you have? Certain stoves make it easierharder to cook certain foods.    What is the expected low temp? Certain foods suck when frozen.            Generally I like dehydrated style meals for dinner.    Breakfast is normally nocook poptarts pastries bars but oatmeal on cold trips really gets me going. Coffee is nice too.     Lunch can be simple PBampJ sandwiches tortillas with meatcheese or just snacks.         Look for pasta sides at  your local grocery store pasta isle. They are easy to prepare and taste great    Packets not cans of tuna chicken salmon and even spam make great additions too.    Powdered potatoes are a great filler.     A spice kit is always a good idea. Packets of condiments from mcdonalds and plenty of hot sauce.          Snacks like nuts and dry fruit are great for the weight  calorie ratio. Beef Jerky is a staple but expensive.     Chocolate and candy is always a treat when backpacking.    Gatorade powder or other electrolyte type drinks are nice but plain water works too. Tea is great for relaxing at night if you arent drinking booze.                   Luckily all this food is quite cheap. Prepackaged dehydrated backpacking food is more expensive  but incredibly easy to prepare just add boiling water. Maybe you could get one prepackaged meal for one special night  and make your own all the other days. Mountain House is the traditional answer for this. About  per person per meal.                    I suggest looking into freezer bag cooking. You basically take dry ingredients and throw them into a freezer ziploc bag  then add boiling water and wait.  minutes later you have a hot meal and there is no cleanup you just have to pack out that ziploc.

6421745,0,t1_czjf61w,Since you are in Canada I cant speak with certainty. However here in the US the rules really vary from park to park. Some places like Anza Borrego Desert allow camping anywhere as long as your a certain distance from the road. As for hiking and camping in wooded areas that arent part of the park first I would make sure that you wouldnt be trespassing on private property. Honestly I think your best bet would be to talk to a park ranger. Make it clear that you are interested in backcountry camping and you wish to respect and abide by their rules. Maybe they will be able to point out places that will fill your need or offer any other suggestions that can help. ,CampingandHiking,czjjmm2,2,t5_2qqom

6545858,0,t3_459n8k,I would start a little more modestly.  days camping and hiking is a big trip for someone with no experience. Maybe try finding a campground somewhere that can be a base of operations for day hikes and other outdoor activities. Staying at a campground gives you more opportunity to figure stuff out like building a campfire and setting up a tent without being too far away from your car or civilization in case the weather gets bad or you end up forgetting something important and being illequipped. It also gives you more time to enjoy the outdoors around you and not worry about having to make it so many miles in time with a heavy pack on your back. Charit Creek lodge in Big South Fork TN is awesome. Or somewhere in the Smokey Mountains. Youd want to make reservations really soon for Spring Break though. If you really are set on hiking and camping out in the back country I would definitely not go very far and not go alone your first time. Go with someone more experienced.I know you were asking just about gear but it kind of depends on what youre going to be doing. The right clothing is very important its basically part of your shelter when youre spending the whole time outside. Absolutely no cotton. Cotton soaks up water like a sponge doesnt insulate and takes forever to dry. You want clothing that will dry quickly and keep you warm even if its soaking wet. Look for athletic style clothing thats designed to wick moisture away and dry quickly. Polyester and wool are the best. Read up on the layer system As far as other gear your school or a place near a popular nature area might have a campingoutdoor adventure outfitter that you can rent stuff like tents sleeping bags sleeping pads backpacks etc. from. This is probably a better idea than sinking a bunch of money into gear before you know what you really needwant.,CampingandHiking,czwe846,22,t5_2qqom

Some jobs allow you to telework so you can work away from the office or during off hours while traveling. Some people use time between jobs to travel. Likewise some places are more conducive to getting outside e.g. Colorado.

How you manage to prioritize things that are important to you is all dependent on you. Explore occupations based on your interests here Research potential jobs here I agree with uBrizzyce.

The most common designs have almost no heat up time and if you make one well you really should only have to do it once. The simplest design that I have used is a halved can stuffed inside itself and a hole punched in the side. You pour alcohol inside and on the top light the top first and then the inside through the side hole.

6975207,0,t3_4b7yi3,I research the trails I want to hike and see if other people have camped on the trials and where they camped. Midatlantic Hikes has a lot of good trail information. Most trails I go on have a little registration box at the trailhead where you put how many people are in your party your license plate number and your arrival and expected departure. I dont recommend overnighting on any trail where the park says it closes at dusk because they will see your car at the trailhead. Most national forests allow overnighting and your best bet would be to stop by the ranger station and ask. As for fires I recommend not building one if you dont need one. To me you are marking the earth by building a fire and if it is not necessary then it is the equivalent of leaving trash on the trail. If you carry a backpacking stove you dont need to make a fire to cook and if you dress properly and pack dry clothes then you should stay warm. Obviously build a fire if it is an emergency or it has a useful purpose but dont build one just because that is what people do when they camp.,CampingandHiking,d16z716,1,t5_2qqom

The rules are here The actual permit must then be picked up at the visitor center right before your trip. The most difficult things for me to grasp before my first trip to Zion were  the seasonally changing hours of all the facilities  i.e. the visitor centershuttle hours and availability vary a lot depending on whether its summer springfall or winter. For summer youre in luck and things are open for the longest hours but make sure and check the exact hours for everything you need to access on the days youll be there.  the shuttle system.

It should give you enough time to put some serious distance between yourself and Baloo. Of course zig zag and cross water whenever possible and safe to make a more complicated trail to follow.

7641583,0,t1_d3arcav,My uncle carries a mm Glock  for defense against wildlife when hes in the woods. A mm is basically a . magnum not . and is generally thought to be the most comfortable cartridge that can take down an angry bear. Plus its easy to get in semiauto handguns . SampW is revolveronly as are many other handcannon rounds and because its only as big around as a . the Glock  can carry  rounds. Still no guarantees.Because the bear will rip you to pieces before it bleeds to deathunconsciousness from even dozens of bullet wounds antihuman ammo like hollowpoints are practically useless. The goal is to cause traumatic damage that the bear physically cant ignore most preferably to the brain or spine. Penetrating rounds like machined solidcopper or solidbrass slugs are ideal theres a lot of angry bear between you and bearspine that the bullet needs to get through and if it falls apart in the bear its practically wasted. A firearm is unarguably less effective than bear spray and big picture its much better to deter a bear than to have to kill it.

They make a huge difference over the tube style Smartwool socks even though theyre both merino Wear merino liners under your merino wool socks Otherwise you need new boots. My heels not slipping is one of my top considerations when trying new boots on and often happens when people buy a half size or even full size too big but can also happen with boots that dont fit well in the heel as every boot is different Ive found that full leather boots especially those with leather on the the inside are far less likely to develop hot spots than ones with mostly synthetic fabrics because they really form fit to your foot. But full leather ones are more expensive and get pretty hot though Ive found that Gore Tex and especially PU waterproofed boots can get just as hot and I never use boots in the summer anyway.

8408880,0,t3_4uq2ip,My friend and I were hiking through Iceland Laugavegur and had purchased some dried goods as well as some premade sandwiches at the local supermarket.  Obviously we were eating the premade sandwiches first within a day and then eating our dried goods.  At least that was the plan.  On the night of the second evening I found a smoked salmon sandwich stuffed in the bottom of my pack that I had forgotten about.  Thinking about how itd only been  days I decided to eat it.  It tasted a little funny but I thought nothing of it and forced it down seeing as I was hungry and wanted some sleep.  I never got that sleep.What followed was one of the most painful diarrhea experiences my buttocks had ever been subjected to.  Whats worse was how it continued for the rest of the hike  more days.  For the first day after the event every hour and a half wed be forced to stop so I could relieve myself.  The following day I at least was so empty nothing was coming out anymore.  By the last day I was so exhausted I could barely carry my pack as I stumbled down the trail.Needless to say I dont eat food thats been smoked anymore.  I find the smell nauseating. ,CampingandHiking,d5snlmq,2,t5_2qqom

Think of them more like a raccoon going through your garbage than a super human monster that wants to eat you. If a bear comes into your camp they arent going to pull you out of your tent.

8551284,0,t1_d6ag1u6,Youre welcome!If youre staying at the George Lake car campground its much easier.  Just keep your food and any strong smelling things like toothpaste sun screen etc in your car overnight or any time youre away from the campsite.   If youre in the back country heres a good video on the PCT method of hanging a bear bag for food and smelly things.When walking on the trails sing to yourself or talk and make noise. IIRC its just black bears in Killarney and they tend to not want to bother with humans. If they hear you theyll go the other way.  This isnt absolute though so be smart about yourself on the trails and consider bringing a bear banger or bear spray as well. Research what to do if you encounter a black bear. Im bringing bear spray when I go and my hiking partner has bear bangers. Theres other animals in the park such as wolves bobcats and moose.  Make sure you do your research and youll be okay.

9496213,0,t3_5aswwg,Best brands Ive come across are Zamberlan and Hanwag. Both incredibly durable and well made. Hanwags are resolable so Ive definitely seen some that were wellloved for about  years before needing replacing. Leather will always stretch to fit your foot better than synthetics and is generally more durable but synthetics are in general cheaper and lighter. Depending on what youre using them for youll want something supportive. Start picking them up and twisting them. The harder it is to twist the more supportive that midsole construction will be! If you cant twist it at all its likely a heavyduty trekking boot. If you can twist it like a sneaker its probably more of a trail runner. So if youre doing multiday treks with a heavier pack youll want something really difficult to twist. If youre just going to be dayhiking with a lighter pack something a bit softer should be fine  but it should definitely feel stiffer than a runner. Ive found that in general with boots you get what you pay for. Theres a massive difference in quality between the  pair and the  pair. Most importantly though they need to fit well. Try them on a ramp. Make sure that after lacing them snugly your toes arent slamming into the end of the boot on the downhill some movement is normal. And make sure your heel isnt slipping up and down a ton when you walk normally. Take them home wear them for a couple of hours indoors to make sure they feel good and they dont have hot spots double check the stores return policy first. If they do have hot spots take them back or if theyre leather ask a cobbler to punch them out to create more room where they hurt! ,CampingandHiking,d9jlzom,1,t5_2qqom
9512495,0,t1_d9lfgux,Not the OP but  of the time hiking the PCT is in the woods or mountains. Most of the towns you go through are tiny vacation towns without much to do other than maybe a bar the only major town you go through is Ashland Oregon. Typically most of your sleeping is done in tents maybe a very rare stay at a hotel if you are lucky. One important thing about the PCT is you are on a time schedule you have to do the first portion in the desert before it gets too late in the summer or else its too hot. While the Sierras need to be reached late enough so the snow melts and finally you have to get to the north Cascades before it gets too late and close to winter. Because of this time restraint you need to hike a minimum of  miles a day.,CampingandHiking,d9lm8jg,3,t5_2qqom

With all this interest in extreme endurance races the throughhike is another notch on many weekend warriors belt.I honestly wish theyd start limiting the number of day hiking permits.

And if youve never done the hike before youre bound to lose the trail in a spot or two and further trample more sensitive areas. I saw this firsthand when folks couldnt follow the almost tooobvious trail and instead wandered in and through our campsite with little regard to us or the vegetation they trampled.

I dunno your budget but a tremendous backcountry experience might be to do a river trip. Better food company access to areas its often tough to get into any other way and plenty of hiking usually after the days river travel. The premier trip in North America is the Grand Canyon but there are lots of others and Id recommend stuff in the SW around say Utah like the Green San Juan other parts of the Colorado etc. The reason is that the terrain is more unique and due to lack of water you can do longer remote trips via river than backpacking.

It can get a bit muddy on the way up depending on if it has been rainy recently but the views from the top give you a view of the entire route the buses take. You are far far above Angels Landing and the Great White Throne is in clear view right next to you. You can stand on the edge and if you are the risky type step out onto an old structure that used to ferry iron down to the base. When I was there an eagle or a hawk maybe had made a nest right at the edge. Youll need a permit to camp at the top but I highly recommend it. It is a fantastic place to watch the sunset. Do the general hikes in the canyon. You can hit the best of the tourist spot in one day and they are worth it.

This happens because the speed of the water flowing is faster on the outside of the bend. Since the water is faster it erodes the earth more quickly.

11328369,0,t3_61nm1m,The only way I could see something like this working is if they did it with a long termsemi permanent tent like boyscout summer camp style canvas tents on wooden platforms. These tents would stay up all season. Theyd only have to be set up and taken down once which would be a huge labor savings. compared to the thin material of a modern collapsible tent they are much more low maintenance and very low wear due to the lack of moving parts and thickness of all the materials and the lack of flooring making an accidental puncture much less likely. They will last many many more uses. cleaning is also minimized to sweepingmopping depending on the messNow of course there are downsides. they are by far the least comfortable non survival shelters that I have ever used especially in humid summers. cabins accomplish just about everything better and have the potential to bring in more revenue year round at that.Wed see much more of this if there was real money in it but it seems the only time it would be profitable enough to justify would be when paired with other revenue streama such as a summer camp program.   ,CampingandHiking,dfg1vew,1,t5_2qqom

11647928,0,t1_dgdhhyu,This has been one of my favorite purchases. You can turn it inside out to act as a bladder holder in a larger pack and then convert it into a day pack. There is definitely enough room for the  essentials as well. ,CampingandHiking,dggb1x5,1,t5_2qqom
11664161,0,t1_dgi58wu,Thanks for replying!I may try the soap thing if it happens again this weekend. I was wondering if it was a combination of my hot breath plus chilly weather. But the winter trip was just a few weeks prior and it was  degrees upper Michigan. I would have thought that Id see that behavior then not three weeks later in  degree weather. ,CampingandHiking,dgi5bos,2,t5_2qqom

11697662,0,t1_dglqsh4,Love them! I was just there in late February. I stayed at an Airbnb in Manarola. I can even see the house in your second picture. It was the narrow red house in the bottom left above the restaurant. Youre right about the hiking as it should not be missed. It was absolutely one of the highlights of our trip to Italy. ,CampingandHiking,dgly5ls,3,t5_2qqom

11724422,0,t3_67ak96,See for yourself Spring can mean snow lotsa snow even falliing snow at higher elevations. Even if the glaciers are shrinking Sorta depends on whether you mean early May or mid June. Frankly Id wanna visit when the road over the pass is open but I dunno when they usually open it. Good spring skiing maybe?,CampingandHiking,dgozs35,1,t5_2qqom
11724842,0,t1_dgp1bos,Yes North Cascades is a perfectly scenic drive but an amazing backpacking trip.,CampingandHiking,dgp1hue,1,t5_2qqom
11769659,0,t3_67v8zv,Only two for me. CA and TN. I did Whitney when I was teenager and I hiked Clingmans Dome when I was at the Smokeys. I hiked from farther out than the base lot though...which was a mistake because it was sunny when I started my trek but by the time I reached the dome it was enshrouded in fog. If I had just driven there I would have had a clear view.I have been to the lowest elevation in several states though. Usually coastlines but also Montana Idaho Wisconsin Michigan and Ohio.,CampingandHiking,dgu4ed2,2,t5_2qqom
11783349,0,t1_dgvn0n2,From May to September it can be extremely hot so most people visit between Thanksgiving and the end of April. Most people choose to base camp bc its extremely dry and youd have to carry a lot of watercache water if youre planning on backpacking. We almost tried to do the Outer Mountain Loop trail ish miles but decided against it bc of the water issue. We ended up staying at a campground in the Chisos Basin which is central to many of the trailheads.The South Rim trail ? miles is quite popular and has gorgeous sites about halfway through. Right now part of it is closed for peregrine falcon nesting though.The hike up to Emory Peak the highest point in the park is also amazing. We also enjoyed the the Lost Mine Trail and the Windows trail which were a little shorter. Next time I want to check out the Santa Elena Canyon.,CampingandHiking,dgvoisy,2,t5_2qqom
11788186,0,t1_dgw4mvx,Haha we werent that bad. Solid hiking shoes and long pants. But only one pair of gloves between us. Hiking that part where they have the chains was the worst because of the cold winds and icy chain links. But still fond memories now lol,CampingandHiking,dgw8av7,2,t5_2qqom
