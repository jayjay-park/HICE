2766123,0,t3_2rr2ho,Some of this I like and some of it I dont.I like the total championship points qualifier.I dont like the Spring Split winner qualifying because well look at C last year. They completely dominated in the Spring and were lackluster in the Summer. Granted they wound up being amongst the best from NA anyway but what if they pulled a CLG in the summer? Thats a long time to turn into a crappy team.I have mixed feelings about the tenth place team automatically getting kicked out. It does force a sense of urgency forcing teams to do whatever they can to not be last. Im also not sure I like the automatic qualifier for the first place Challenger team either. I will wait and see before I cast judgement on these two issues.I also have uneasy feelings about more teams. Lets face it there are only a few really good teams in the LCS. Adding more teams doesnt add more quality.I do like the coachs new role in picks and bans. I cant wait for this split to start. I am looking forward to it.EDIT I was wrong about the Spring Split champ qualifying for Worlds. I read that incorrectly somehow. Thanks to those that corrected my error. I appreciate it.,TForceNetwork,cnihx8y,2,t5_34azs

3970967,0,t3_35y3gh,. Learn wave control so they cant put you in freezekill situations. . Try to use direct input after every CS to walk back or dodge skillshots. . Make sure you hit all the CS you attempt. Taking harass and missing CS is a free ticket to feederville.. As Whale said dont get cheesed on level thresholds. . Look for good roams.. If youre losing and using SS remember that a good jungler will know that. Ward.. Dont Ask your jungler for help if you dont have kill pressure. Opponent has flashTankyCan v Its a team game and you can still win if you dont waste peoples time. . The rest is matchup dependent. Play the same champion a lot for this one. Or ask a high elo player to watch replay and help you figure it out if youre stuck in a rut with a champion. ,TForceNetwork,cr8x936,3,t5_34azs

The hosts have a giant outline with point by point topics and they followed it through most of the Irelia show. But seeing as its always been easy for us to go offtopic the Irelia episode suffered from a few moments of that. Great advice and Ill make sure the team is aware that they should stick to the script. ,TForceNetwork,crnk6b3,1,t5_34azs

6441204,0,t3_43us27,Theres only one piece id like to throw in that hasnt already been mentioned and thats taking a look at not just your comp but theirs. Yi has an incredibly high variance between his minimum and maximum impact in a teamfight thanks to his susceptibility to CC. Id say if the enemy team already has tons of CC your effectiveness might be wasted since you can get blown up pretty easily where a Vi or Diana might not. Similarly as uFroztbyteSC mentioned if your team is heavy damage but no CC then that same principle might apply. Im not saying you wont win with Yi in either situation but using that kind of pregame knowledge to adapt to comps while not sacrificing too much comfort can be crucial to get into your head as you climb.,TForceNetwork,czlk5gz,2,t5_34azs
6599612,0,t3_462pnj,Your blitz asked why Zzrot? Because as we moved into mid game and seemingly had it all under control I was planning on dropping some fat monsters on side lines and forcing down towers with my group. Buuuut then the poorly executed dive happened bot with no clear shot calling and we kind of lost our footing. Went down a bunch of turrets and tried to overcome our deficit....and the rest is history.Fun game thanks for playing! ,TForceNetwork,d01ycdj,1,t5_34azs

7401461,0,t1_d2jc7nd,What I believe theyre doing with the challenger roster is loopholing the import rule. Impact Rush and Jensen are all considered imports so they can only play  of them. However after  consecutive splits of  play in one region a player becomes naturalized so Rush and Impact would be considered NA players in Spring of  and they would be able to play all of them.They dont want to lose any of them and want to keep all of them within their organization so thats the reason they made this challenger team. How they chose Rush to be the one to move down I dont know.,TForceNetwork,d2jhwtw,1,t5_34azs

10302375,0,t3_5ni6gi,BA and trolls all disappear....Seriously though yes trolls are frustrating especially in your series but what use does getting mad or upset do you? You cant control their player theres nothing you can say if someone really wants to troll and your rage is exactly what they want. Ignoring them honestly is the best and only thing you really can do. The reason that it feels that there are more trolls is because of autofill. People dont know how to play the role so instead of trying hard and failing at it they protect their egos by purposely throwing when placed there.Statistically though you win just as many games against people who cant play their role as you lose because of them the losses just stick out more. Again its out of your control so why waste anymore thought or energy on it? Brush it off and just refocus on your own play.,TForceNetwork,dcbtvll,4,t5_34azs
10399860,0,t1_dcm2bmt,I think the amount of money that relegation is costing teams will eventually outweigh all other factors.Teams in the bottom half of the league are losing out on million dollar sponsorship deals because companies fear their investment will be lost at the end of the splitEventually the LCS should just have  consistent teams and challenger would be expanded to  teams and each LCS team would have a challenger team. The challenger series would serve like a minor league team where teams could place their young playersRiot will only get  chance to implement franchises though so they want to make sure they switch to a franchise model when teams values are at the absolute highest. The more big soccer teams PSG Shalke and private equity investors P Liquid Dig that buy into the league the more valuable the LCS spots are in a franchised league.Riot wants an organized structure they want regional tournaments collegiate tournaments and events like scouting grounds to be where teams recruit players from. Then those players will get significant salaries and benefits from playing in the challenger league.As of right now a team like PSG in challenger that is expected to make LCS next split is actually making teams like Roccat and Origen worth less money because they could be gone in a few months,TForceNetwork,dcmw2sx,1,t5_34azs
