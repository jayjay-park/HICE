10158616,0,t3_5lfhy5,My eczema didnt disappear but its definitely much less now. My face used to be covered with it at all times and now I rarely have eczema in my face anymore. However the eczema that I do still have are probably caused by scratching my eczema started years before I went dairy free and over the years I kind of got addicted to scratching myself and various other allergies cats leather and a common ingredient in soap.,dairyfree,dbvjami,4,t5_2so4h
