3620929,0,t3_31u3j6,Good question firstly you want to use ED Shipyard to find out how much youll need to save up before buying the T Secondly... and Ill just copypaste this from another post Keep a safety margin!  super important. The safety margin includes  things  The cost of one insurance payment in case you crash  the cost of one fully loaded trip calculate this amount using the cost of your highest priced good and  an additional  of your ships total worth. the reason for the last bit is because everytime you sell your ship you lose  of your ships total worth  this will negatively affect your assets. To mitigate this sell ALL of your internal compartments weapons utility mounts and exchange out all of your internal outfits i.e. your FSD Sensors Thrusters Fuel Tank Power Plant Power Distributor and Life support for their lowest possible means e.g. exchange your A Power Plant to a E Power Plant BEFORE you sell your ship. Doing this will lower your ships TOTAL value and thus the amount of credits that youll lose.Lastly I would encourage you to find other routes... crt each way is by no means a bad route however there are MANY MANY more much better routes out there!,EliteTraders,cq50gxx,3,t5_32st1

3681741,0,t3_32if0w,It would depend on what role you plan to outfit the Clipper for and how highly rated you want the components to be.  A normal tradeClipper would be around  million.  In this scenario it may make sense to skip the T and just work your way up to the Clipper with an Asp or whatever.But you said the main goal is the Clipper so Im guessing you dont just want to trade in it.  An Arated combat clipper is much much more expensive  e.g. just a A shield costs  million.  Even with a relatively modest outfitting youll probably sink  million into it.  Using the T as a stepping stone will get you there quicker.You can use  to play around with different outfittings and cost estimates.  The T generally makes about  more than an Asp on normal commodity routes much larger cargo space but poorer jump range ship speed and station choice.  You can probably make around  million in a T vs about  million in an Asp with a nice route.  You will lose about . million in the sale of the T eventually but with the difference in profits it means it pays for itself in an hour or two.  I guess you could also just go straight from the Asp to a basic trade Clipper and then trade for a while in order to have the money to outfit it.  Its a very capable trade ship too better than the T in most ways.A word of warning though  Ts are not made for rares trading they are only really worth it for normal commodity trading.

6489759,0,t1_czoue2x,Thanks Metaj.  Since I posted this I went ahead with the money I had and just bought the Asp Explorer bought the best equipment I could for it with a lousy mil and proceeded to Robigo anyway  Failed the first set of missions...learned from that mistake and made a successful circuit on my next round about netting me  million.  Since then I have made enough to fully copy your build and net an additional  million after fully kitting.  All of this in a matter of maybe  hours total play time.  Before I was trading good at a profit of around  per ton in the T netting around mill every hour...this was a huge jump  glad I took the risk and decided to get my hands a little dirty.Thanks for all your help! your really changed the game for me!,EliteTraders,czql8fo,2,t5_32st1

7619620,0,t3_4jlm2m,gt Perfect escape vector while interdicted  All blue NO red No escape. Even while counting to   seconds while in full blue  no escape. During the same event as above still with half a blue bar left and throttle at zero  FSD Failure Being interdicted at ltMm spawning back at LSIve never done Robigo smuggling but those all happen to me fairly regularly while doing normal trading and it does my head in. I havent bothered fighting an interdiction for a long time because it never seems to let me win no matter what and when I submit it still fails about  of the time. Its not like Im in that much danger because generally if somethings strong enough to get through my shields its slow enough for me to fight back and if its too fast for me to catch its too weak to kill me before my FSD charges back up but its still bloody annoying.,EliteTraders,d38b7s7,3,t5_32st1

Repeat this until you find a friendly CutterCorvette then follow your new friends. The enemy NPCs seem programmed to have you as a preferred target if they arent getting shot at. Just make sure you let the friendly NPCs shoot them first and you should be fine. Especially if you fly around with a pair of friendly Corvette bodyguards.,EliteTraders,d86v5s6,1,t5_32st1
