10353345,0,t1_dcha79i,gt Let me hear them!Mentioned some of them in your brocialism thread.  The idea that these people have largely gotten the short end of the stick.  The article about Trump supporters does a great job surmising their sentiments.I want to stress that such Trump supporters are not the same as the altright.  The media is somewhat disingenuous in this regard.  The altright are literally neonazis.  They are not economicly unified some are actually quite socialist as I had mentioned some are libertarians and everything in between.  What unites them is race plain and simple.One big thing would be to stop the average Trump supporter from radicalizing.  Be it engagement information whatever.  From my own personal experience there is actually a rift between the altright subreddit and rthedonald.  To the altright TD are fauxrightists very similar to the disconnect one might witness between a proHillary and proBernie sub.  This sentiment exists beyond reddit as well.  So right there exists a chokepoint to stop people from moving further toward fascism.  To target Trump supporters it might help to try to point out similarities in the struggles between say inner city black populations and rural working class whites.  Objective is class unity.  These people arent inherently racist they just feel slighted and maybe a bit jealous.Targeting the altright proper is a different beast entirely.  Overcoming their racism is tough because they truly believe it.  As I mentioned elsewhere I am a biomedical science Phd student.  I see studies in genetics and scientific concepts thrown around all the time and as someone who understands this stuff better than them I try to correct it.  But its hard.  To be honest I dont have any answers here other than damage control but would be curious if you or anybody else had perspectives perhaps I dont.,RedSpecters,dchm1s2,1,t5_3ii6n
