4974420,0,t3_3itms9,Waddle This is not the song im going to use for the real trailer as i said this is a test. Chat will be remove thanks for mentioning me.Nigel Could u tell me what song might fit? and yes i will hide it. All Kirby Smash was just a test because i dont know what other songs i should use for testing so i went and look for some ideas and found PLaces trailer and give it a try to make a LoR trailer with that song. The real song im going to use is different but Im not sure what kind or what song should i use. Sooo... ima make another test trailer D so that u guys can judge if this song is better or nah. Also leave your comments on what songs do you like so that i can know your taste in musics. Cuz when i ask in game people give me really akward musics. Thanks again guys!,LeagueofROBLOX,culk9ou,1,t5_38trv
