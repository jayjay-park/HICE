1637497,0,t3_2clwcg,Book restorer here.   Youve picked a very difficult book to attempt your as your first restoration.  First they are staple holes Ive seen quite a few books like this. This style binding is mideuropean mid to late s.  You can try and resew that book but those large holes have greatly weakened the signature folds.  If you try to repair them before sewing the additional paper will bulk up the text and make it larger than the book casing.  In fact even adding  sewing threads will probably bulk up the text enough to prevent the existing cover from being reused unless you do a leather reback.  See how complicated this has gotten and we have only touched the initial issues with this book.Stiil if you are intent on restoring this Ill give you some recommendations with a couple of caveats.  If you make a mistake or do it wrong any value the book might have will be gone.  Either of these two methods I am conveying will put the book back into useable condition but you will have to handle it somewhat gently no drops no  deep spine bending that sort of thing. You can sew it and hope the bulk of the sewing threads will be less than the bulk of the original staples but even if so there does not appear to be enough solid paper at the top of the page to make the last sewing loop and the required kettle stitch the sewing joint that binds one signature to the one below it and that one to the one below and so on.  I wouldnt even consider sewing this if I was doing the work too many issues too many things to go wrong. You can stack and square the book racking it to get the spine square then put it into boards and clamps exposing just the spine.  Then take a very small saw coping back saw and cut kerfs across the spine in locations away from the staple holes.  Glue linen sewing thread into the cut grooves.  Must be linen cotton threads will not last. Use wheat paste glue all along the spine just to help the signatures a little more but let it dry overnight.  Line the spine with Japanese tissue paper then add headbands new inner hinges and a hollow tube all in that order.   Then you can recase the book.  But that cover needs some work. If you get this far PM me for some tips on how to do the cover.  You could also drill  holes along the spine and whip sew the book together but this will take up most of the inner margins and may make the book unreadable.     So i think the kerf cuts is the only answer and it is a mediocre or poor choice  at best but perhaps the only one left to you.   Like I said a very difficult book for a novice.   I would only give this book to a binder with  years experience and even then I suspect I would have to give some additional guidance.  FWIW most of the online DIY book restoration guides are wrong very very wrong.   You can find good videos and instructions on how to make a new binding but when it comes to old books most people have no idea what they are talking about so be careful what you read.If you are interested in this field start with Laura Youngs Hand Bookbinding and Restoration then get Middletons Restoration of Leather Bindings.   They are not easy to digest and get right without live demos but at least the information is correct.  ,BookCollecting,cjlkkml,2,t5_2sdrj

There are people selling this book on eBay for  with a perfectly identical signature to yours. They are all spaced exactly the same and have the exact same angle.

2374152,0,t3_2mivgu,My guess is that they are from a later nicely bound set of Dickens novels.  I believe the first edition of Bleak House is considered to be the monthly publications but there are bound first editions with Bradbury and Evans as publishers.  I did a quick check to see if I could find a duplicate binding with Chapman as a publisher but could not.  It would not be unusual for books to be rebound so an exact match is not altogether surprising.  Fun books none the less.   ,BookCollecting,cm55jr9,3,t5_2sdrj

3811684,0,t3_33qhwl,The relative merits of EP v FS have been pretty well discussed here but its also definitely worth knowing that EP started by acquiring the rights to and then subsequently reprinting the Heritage Presss back catalog. The Heritage Press of course was effectively the massmarket little brother of the Limited Editions Club LEC. It worked like this The LEC started in the s and published one book per month for its  members. With only a few exceptions each volume was illustrated with art specifically commissioned for it and the type printed letterpress. The illustrations were generally reproduced in the best manner possible woodcuts were printed directly from the blocks watercolors were reproduced by handcoloring in each and every of the  volumes! etc. The club was popular enough that the publishers soon started the Heritage Press which reprinted each of the LEC volumes but in a smaller format and without the handmade aspects type was linotype or later offset litho same for illustrations. The Heritage volumes are very similar qualitywise in my opinion to Folio Society volumes.In the s Easton Press bought Heritage Press from the LEC and began basically photographing the text and illustrations from the Heritage Press volumes and reproducing them in a leather binding. In other words most of the original Easton Press classics are basically copies of copies. This is important because you can find Heritage Press books for  each in great shape. If you spend just a bit more perhaps on average  a volume or less you can find a vast majority of the  or so titles the LEC published. The difference between the quality of the illustrations in the newer EP reproductions and the earlier Heritage Press reprints are stunning and the difference between EP and the original LEC is even more amazing particularly considering you can often get the LEC for less than the EP version. Easton Press has of course by now published many many volumes that were never Heritage or LEC so if you are interested in those you might not have a choice but if you are tempted by an EP volume its always worth a look to see if you can find an LEC or Heritage version first. ,BookCollecting,cqqrgti,5,t5_2sdrj

6099901,0,t1_cyivcw0,Replying here just for relevance.Harry Potter is a brilliant example of this situation. The true first printing UK of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban can be identified by  errors  is JoAnne Rowling rather than JK on the copyright page and a misalignment in the text on the first page of the story page  overall. Because of this error the press was stopped and reset so there were very few copies of this printing. Despite the fact that Prisoner of Azkaban overall was printed in huge numbers that would make it normally not particularly valuable the rarity of this particular true first printing makes it worth in the k range in pristine condition as much or more than Chamber of Secrets which had a significantly smaller overall run. The error doesnt make the copy valuable its just the fact that the error caused them to stop printing and deliate a smaller rarer subsection of the first printing.Collectors are crazy Also fyi for OP the Canadian first edition points are generally exactly the same as the UK minus the previous example. This is a first Canadian printing but still not particularly valuable for the reasons Strychnineman mentioned.,BookCollecting,cyizw44,3,t5_2sdrj

My version is somewhere in the neighborhood of twice as large even though it is also put out by penguin.

8224597,0,t3_4ryr6b,Antique Roadshow fostered the belief that any repairs restorations or changes to anything old would destroy the value of the object in question.   While this is true for certain antique and collectible items the book world has long taken a more pragmatic view.  Books were made to be used and in the process of being used they are going to get damaged. In the book collecting world  collectors of modern first editions still want pristine like new books but they are the exception. These collectors can have this attitude because there are still copies of such books available but in the past ten years or so even this high demanding group of collectors have begun to accept the fact that pristine copies may not always be available or affordable and a repaired copy for your collection is better than no copy at all. In the rest of the book collecting world pristine books bring top dollar because of their scarcity but most times there is not a pristine copy to be had or anything even close so book collectors are far more willing to accept a repaired or restored book. There will be a lesser valuation but no where near the discounts you see in other collectibles and with really rare books there can no reduction in value. The things that will affect value after restoration are scarcity whether the repairs were done correctly to conservation standards and whether the repairs were done aesthetically that is consistent with the appearance and look of the book originally. A poorly or improperly repaired book may destroy the entire value.   I had a signed Stephen King Carrie once come to me that was bought on Ebay.  The book had lost its hollow tube a  repair and the spine was saggy.  The seller injected gorilla glue between the spine and the text block and pressed together to make the book look tight and stable.  Made the book worthless.  Book repairs are suppose to be done to conservation standards. In a nutshell this means that any work done can be undone at a future time without materially damaging the critical and important parts of the book.  This is accomplished by using certain acid free and reversible adhesives using acid free materials and doing the work in such a manner that only lightly infringes on the original paper or binding. Next up is the need to insure that the materials used are consistent with the original materials.   For example if you are replacing the endpapers on a th century leather bound book you need to buy paper that is similar to what was used in that period and the paper needs to match in texture and color.  if you are repairing a binding the repair material should match. Lastly and this is the area that separates restorers the work should be finished in such a way that the repairs are well hidden to the casual viewer.  This is not to deceive anyone but to make the book look as much like the original condition as possible.   Top notch book restorers are all artists.   These are the reasons why a serious collector will pay the money to have a professional restore the book.   This is normally not a DIY project because you will lack the conservation knowledge the skill suppliers of needed materials and the artistry to make it look great.  A properly restored book will gain in value sometimes enormously if there are no better copies available.  If an original pristine copy has sold within the last  years or so then that sale price is usually the base point for evaluating a restored copy.   Where yours is the only copy available a restoration will increase the value and more importantly make the book more likely to sell.  Most collectors will pass on a copy with the boards off and will wait for one in at least useable condition.   Here is my guideline when a book comes in with such issues.   If no other copies are available and the book is collectible a good restoration will likely get  of the highest recorded sale value.If there are very few copies available you will get  of the top end value.If there are ten or more copies available elsewhere in better condition then sell it as is and move on. Tldr Talk to a professional restorer to learn your options. If you can afford it and the market is currently favorable for that title get the book restored using  as much of the original materials as possible. ,BookCollecting,d55mq0x,7,t5_2sdrj
