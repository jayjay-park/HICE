6556253,0,t1_czxgmgv,It was kind of improvised but inspired by a fake pad thai recipe ok so i used about  grams of soba noodles and one small broccoli head which I peeled and cut into small pieces. Cooked both in the same pot for  minutes. meanwhile I mixed together a sauce of one teaspoon peanut butter one teaspoon tamarind paste one teaspoon soy sauce one teaspoon vegetable oil and one very small piece of freshly crushed garlic. Strained everything and added the sauce and sprinkled some sesame on it. Super fast easy and very yummy recipe. Enjoy!,vegetarianfoodporn,czxgxy0,3,t5_2xzud
