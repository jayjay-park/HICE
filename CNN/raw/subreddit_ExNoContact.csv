952386,0,t3_250ryg,Been almost  weeks since NC for me. At the moment I feel pretty good. She blocked me a few weeks ago I unfollowed a lot of her friends on social media so Im pretty oblivious to her activities but I have ideas of what shes doing. Right now as I write this I feel pretty alright. I dont care much for what she does and am trying to enjoy my life right now. Doin pretty good in that aspect actually regularly working out going out etc. She does plague the back of my mind still all the time but its not as bad as before! Havent had a single urge to reach out to her. At this point I dont want her back at all and if I ever see her Id probably just wave or something but wouldnt take time out of my day to talk to her. I just dont really care as much about her which feels awesome. Fuck her. NC is the way to go!,ExNoContact,chcjlxp,2,t5_319jr

1088171,0,t3_26ki18,Looks like youre having a tough day too this weekend. Im on day  and I woke up yesterday like it was day . I thought I was getting better because days  I hadnt cried but yesterday I felt crushed. I cried a lot and missed him so much. I think this long weekend has just been hard because I normally used to spend all my weekends with him. I remember before we broke up how much I was looking forward to this weekend because I thought it would be awesome to spend together because it was a longer weekend.Earlier like  hours ago my sister had to talk me out of wanting to message him. Its been really rough this weekend. I hope this doesnt continue for the both of us and we can heal faster. Youre not alone in feeling like this. Kudos to keeping NC. I wish you the best ,ExNoContact,chrz7n1,1,t5_319jr

When you see him it could be difficult but dont think of him as your EX or even an old friend treat him like hes somebody you know from work and make it all matteroffact amp businesslike. Dont react to any provocations and dont act depressed. If you act depressed or angry hell feel that he still has power over you.

Weve lived in the same zip code for  years and Ive only run into him on accident one time that I know of so theres very little chance well meet now that were over.Honestly he was never particularly supportive or validating. It was just nice to have someone around to keep me from feeling completely alone.

I miss her so much and Im always thinking about her. There was nothing wrong with our relationship except for long distance but we still saw each other often enough. She was the one I just know it I feel it. She says she doesnt think she should be in a relationship right now...I think thats a dumb reason to leave the person you loved with all your heart and the person you have shared the last . months together. Im trying to be strong but she gave me strength I never had before and confidence too. I am completely and utterly in love with her and I know if I get another chance with her it will be for good. After I graduate next year Im gonna try and give it another shot if she is single......I guess Ill just wait and see...Im hoping she changes her mind before that...but I know that wont happen. She was  sure about her decision. I love you Nicole. ,ExNoContact,cibzjo7,3,t5_319jr

1355789,0,t1_cim8gdb,Yes I broke up with her. This wasnt the first time. She was addicted to pain killers and was lying to me. Shes exceptionally submissive and easily persuaded so you can understand how this was very unnerving for me. Not to mention she had a few mental issues lots of emotion and mood swings when she was off her meds zoloft. I was in love with her but her irresponsible lifestyle was just not something I could handle logically. But I am led to believe she just needs someone which is why she moved on so quickly.

1521981,0,t1_cj6kru6,Ah bummer  I think that kind of false hope can really be a killer. I was with someone recently only briefly but in that short time I put a lot of myself into creating a relationship based on the idea of what it could be instead of what it really was. And ending things with him was harder than with a few other guys because I had so many questions and Im still finding it difficult to let go of the dream of him. Shes better off dealing with those problems on her own and youre better off not having them in your life.

1707972,0,t3_2dyc5w,Im really sorry for you. I know how alone you feel we are going through the same. You ARE too good for him. and he might realize it someday. then maybe hell reach out and maybe youll care that he did. it wont matter. all that matters is surviving the NOW.Everything reminds me of her too. I just have to keep fighting my fight. Antidepressants have been helping me feel numb. Not sure how I feel about them especially on a mediumlong term but now they are really good for me. I am getting stronger though I miss her the one I would spend my life with and my absolute rock. She left a void no hobby or new friend can fill. But we have to keep going. Stay strong on the No Contact. We are here for you ,ExNoContact,cjug9ny,1,t5_319jr
1737961,0,t1_cjy6upx,Obviously thats your decision.But know this No Contact is for your HEALING not you GETTING HER BACK. and No contact means no contact at all  personal social networks etc. It really is your decision depends on how you felt about her how you feel now and how much you are or are not over the relationship. Theres not a magical x number of days where itll be allright to contact her if ever. For some people they spend some time not contacting for a while then go back to some kind of friendship and theyre ok with it. Some get back in a relationship after a while. some never contact again at all I think this will be my path. It really does depend on all the circumstances.If I were you I would not contact her. She chose to let you out of her life. Go full no contact. If she changes her mind accept contact from her that shows clear intention of getting back together. other than that no contact at all. It really is hard trust me. My posts show that and other peoples as well as you can see here. but it does work and it does get better.,ExNoContact,cjy8fnz,2,t5_319jr

1783584,0,t1_ck3g0hx,Some days can be hard but I find that each hard day brings about a break through and the days after get easier.  When I have a hard day I usually eliminate something that reminds me of him.  Ive changed my bedspread taken away his access to my Netflix and replaced gifts he bought me little by little.  I could have done it all at once but I think doing it slowly when I have a tough day has been cathartic and then I have one less reminder in my life. I think because I was already pretty far removed from my relationship by the time I finally started NC I moved through the stages of letting go a little faster than most.  I no longer react much when I hear about them and I generally am starting to feel apathetic towards him.  I can admit to myself that I had a lot of concerns about his ability to grow up and commit to marriage and kids that would have broken us up even if he hadnt pulled the trigger first.There is still part of me that thinks there is this very small chance that if they break up we could have another shot but Im starting to think about letting that go now. Oddly even though I think its a good thing it makes me sad because its almost like letting go of a dream or life goal that you had for so long.Feel free to PM me if youre having a rough day and want to talk. ,ExNoContact,ck3z3gn,2,t5_319jr
1799278,0,t1_ck3z3gn,I like the idea of eliminating something each day. That sounds constructive and it allows you do something with the feelings. I dont have a lot of physical things  I find its just stupid little things that remind me of him. Like today I was cooking something I had made for him a while ago and I remembered how much he liked it and I felt sad. Its just those little moments that tear me up inside. Im hoping they go away eventually. I know what you mean about the small chance of getting back together. I honestly cling onto it. Its weird because its just this strong feeling inside that he will still come back  I dont know why I have it but Ive had it before with exes when it was obvious that they werent coming back. I want that sad feeling to come it just wont. Its weird because my logical self is pretty damn sure he wont be back but the emotional side of myself just cant let go. Sigh...I guess it just takes time. Did you find yourself clinging onto that feeling? Was it similar to what Im describing  almost this feeling in your heart that they will come back even though your brain knows they wont?,ExNoContact,ck5yb3m,1,t5_319jr
1808381,0,t1_ck72n5t,It is hard to let things up to time it sucks to not be in control of what will happen. All you can do is be the best person you can for yourself not to get her back but because you want to be the best version of yourself that there is eventually when you reach that point everything else will fall in place.I personally had to kill of hope of getting back together in my mind to move on if it is supposed to happen it will.

1817035,0,t3_2fcyzp,I think I know how you feel. I have plenty of friends and acquaintances and people I can hang out with but I never really get close to people. I always stay kind of distant and in someways am a loner. With her I actually opened up myself and my heart completely and now that shes gone and wont even be my friend I feel so lonely. Loneliness Ive never felt before. Ive lost my best and closest friend who happened to also be my lover. I dont miss other people the way I miss her. I dont talk to other people they way I talked to her. So yeah I definitely feel completely alone now. ,ExNoContact,ck84wn6,3,t5_319jr

If that changes Ill deal with it then but its tough man. I realized I just stopped working on myself and instead pushed her to do better instead of pushing myself as well. All of these thoughts came into my head in the weeks after the breakup happened. The loss of hope came a few weeks ago and that changed into the mindset of whatever happens between us in the future I just have to deal with as it happens. If its meant to be itll be.

2102039,0,t1_cl6whu7,Some good things to remember are that while she is a negative influence you are no longer responsible for really even caring. While I know its easier said than done maybe you can try to find solace in your friends. Like I was telling another guy your senior is meant to be your best because this is it after you leave highschool you cant get back the time that could have been spent going to games chilling with friends partying and who knows it still early in the school year you could possibly meet someone new. What I found out in highschool is that there is alot of stuck up douchey people that will get a big reality slap later in life. Yes sometimes it happeneds to good people but its alot harder for selfish people who dont change to maintain friendships and morals to be given respect. Do yourself a favor and pack all her shit up if you still have it and toss it. Let her make her own choices you gotta worry about yourself and its easier now because you still have a house and supportive friends and family that will help in anyway. Its harder when youre my age but I too am learning everything I just told you.Its Saturday night man get out there and kick it with some good music and friends and look for a party to go to JUST REMEMBER TO BE RESPONSIBLE....

You arent making things better and you surely arent slowly convincing her to love you again. You made a mistake and she broke up with you so I see why you feel the need to resolve things but she already made her decision. If she changes her mind about it then Im sure shell let you know but until then you need to move on. Contacting her hasnt worked thus far so take some time and space apart. You know the NC drill.

2272990,0,t3_2l9hh8,Hmm I think this could go either way. What do you hope to accomplish with contacting her and having this conversation?If it is just to show her that youre doing fine on your own and improving does she really need to know that and is that necessary? Are you trying to remain friends now that you are at a good point with yourself? Because then you need to ask yourself how you would handle seeinghearing her talk about other men in her life.I think the safe bet is just to send the generic text that the office needs the key.

2446162,0,t3_2ng4xw,It is important indeed! You almost have to make a list of what to do as soon as you wake up. Brush teeth put clothes on drink something eat breakfast etc. The first weeks Id wake up soullessly wandered my house only to realise I hadnt eaten breakfast when it was  in the afternoon already.I lost a lot of weight and Im still skinnier than I was. When I met my stepsis to talk about my break up she almost started forcefeeding me. You eat way too little youll be sick! And she was right though. I have IBS so irregular eating will end up in stomachpain for me. It was a good reason to eat even if I did feel sick with sadness. Though the feeling of not being able to eat is finally away for more than two weeks. Its reallyyyyy important.And a tip eat bananas Gwen Steffani is that you? No? spinach white beans avocados sweet potatoes or yoghurt they contain potassiun which you need when you feel stressed.

2501673,0,t3_2o9ykh,Remember that breakups happens for a reason. All of us here know how you feel. This rollercoaster of emotions that you are experiencing. The best thing you can do for yourself right now is to focus on improving yourself. Focus on what went wrong in the relationship and learn from your mistakes. Pick up some new hobbies take the time to enjoy being single. Try to go at least  days without contacting her. If you want to fight for her still after the  days here is where it gets complicated.She broke up with you so if after some time you decide to contact her and ask her for another go you have to be able to accept rejection or these feelings that you are having now will come back and worse. All the progress you have made will have been for nothing as you will be back to square .After you have given each other some time to heal and grow apart. Tell her how you feel ONCE. Maybe she rejects you maybe she doesnt. You need to accept both possibilities. Once you tell her how you feel she will not forget this. This is all you can do if she truly loves you and wants to be with you will hear back from her.Overall please do not take this time and focus on getting her back. Take the time to be a better person plan for the worst hope for the best.Hope this helps. If you want you can pm me anytime.,ExNoContact,cml3ukm,1,t5_319jr
2538233,0,t3_2ordbr,Not gonna lie  I think that was a dick move on his part. Why? I feel like its a way of him trying to justify his cheating to you. Like I work so much better with this girl that I cheated on you with and I didnt with you. It sounds like hes intentionally trying to cause you sadness and pain especially since he correctly surmises that you still hold some fondness for him. Even if things arent working with her hes still going to make her seem like the greatest thing ever. Anyway youre right to feel some fondness for him.

Even when faced with your ex you can keep your composure and not let your emotions take over. Just make sure that you truly are ready to see him before you get to it. Another thing behaving in a calm and collected manner will surely shock him and may make it easier for you to recover once you see how strong you are capable of being. c,ExNoContact,cmyofxx,3,t5_319jr

2655989,0,t3_2qbiu0,Hey guys I bring a not so important update.Last night I went out and... didnt see her! So that was good. But tonight in my hangover I started thinking about wishing her merry christmas and said... Why not?. After all Ive been over  months NC I dont think any answer she can have is gonna faze me much. And so it was she replied wishing me a merry christmas too. I then wrote again trying to keep conversation alive saying something sorta funny. She laughed and wished me well.That was it it wasnt so much a feeling of hurt but more one of being bummed. I would have liked a different answer from her but Im sort of okay with this one too. I think this is a very good signal. Considering I had broken NC and without much pain I decided to visit her twitter she doesnt use it much. I didnt see anything really interesting there either. A couple statuses maybe hinted some other guy but that was it... Im pretty fine just bummed and a tiny little sad. Very very different from how I felt  or  months ago when I sort of accidentally peeked at her twitter.Time to reset the counter. Goodbye  days I will get there again lol.,ExNoContact,cn59mt1,1,t5_319jr

I made a post recently in a similar vein.It IS a waiting game and i think some of the people who commented here are all wrong and dont understand what youre going through. It IS a waitin game inthat your mind wants to be done with her. Its trying. Its trying its damndest to get over her. But your heart isnt complying. So its a waiting game and youre waiting for your heart to comply. And there are thigs you try to do to make it easier like distract yourself but you cant distract yourself forever.All this is from my point of view at least.Just want you to know youre not alone man my ex jumped REAL quick into a relationship as well. We were together  months and not even a month later shes got this guy. Try to be good to yuorself man. The way im looking at this is that not to sympathize withthem but she got so torn up over what she lost she is consciously going into a rebound to try and replace the awesomeness that is you. And maybe itll fail maybe it wont. But regardless of what they BELIEVE you and i both KNOW our exes are losing SO much in breakig up with us.Hope you feel better,ExNoContact,cnp6upf,8,t5_319jr

Well in October she contacted him because she needed help with her homework.She told him we can do things as friends and see if anything develops she invited him to her thanksgiving and sat on a different couch than him. She wont go on dates with him but sometimes on Sundays she will play computer games with him. He basically did her whole homework project that took hours. He said she has feelings for him but she is scared of committment and physical touch. All the while he and I kissed cuddle he told me he loves me and has feelings for me we texted every day.

3063416,0,t1_cofggnx,But your closure is not their responsibility at all its your responsibility. Your feelings are  your responsibility. Theyve taken responsibility for their feelings and acted upon it theyve ended the relationship. Its really not their job to do anything else. Also Id really like to touch on the unspoken vow. Yes a strong relationship is built on trust honesty and openness. But these are basic values that people use to guide their decisions not unspoken vows which lock them into relationships that are no longer mutually fulfilling. Shes not a possession. No matter how you spin it this person does not owe you a relationship any more than they owe you closure. Youre putting an unhealthy amount of responsibility on this person. Saying they owe you closure or owe you commitment says you arent interested in honesty or openness it just says you want to override their decisions and hold them accountable for your feelings. Good decency is respecting other peoples choices and accepting they are not responsible for you. I know break ups are hard but at the end of the day she is only responsible for her feelings and you are only responsible for yours. ,ExNoContact,cofiqeq,3,t5_319jr

3155214,0,t3_2w9xf5,Oh there are too many to even mention!First one should have been him telling me he loved me on the first date. We had met online and talked for about three weeks every night on the phone for hours so it wasnt super creepy at the time. Its not romantic its creepy. To go along with the meeting on the Internet thing he started to sext with me before we even met. At the time I thought it was weird that a guy I have never met was sending me pictures of his dick but I was naive and didnt have much experience with sex before I met him. I had fallen so head over heels that it didnt register at the time he creepy it was. So in my head I thought talking like he did was normal. Its not. When he would talk about former relationships it was always woe is me. Everyone was always out to get him and he was innocent in it all. Now that I know the other sides to the stories I know that wasnt the case at all. He was just a dick so people treated him as such. His constant over drinking. He would call me and tell me how much he loved me and how Im the best person he ever met. But it was actually him just being lonely and drunk by himself and spewing out whatever he thought I wanted to hear. I now know he is a full blown alcoholic. Hes luckily going to aa since I broke up with him so good for him. After being long distance for about six months and seeing each other every weekend the constant romancing and bombarding of love started to trail off. I brought it up and he said he was just getting busy with work and his band so I let it slide. I then moved three hours away from my family to live closer to him. Dumb on my part I know but he told me he wouldnt be happy until we lived in the same town. And thinking at the time that he was my soulmate and one true love i believed thats what would make him happy. After a few months of being together as a real couple without the distance I started learning little lies he would tell. One big lie that I shouldnt have let slide was him being a smoker for the past  months and him hiding it from me. Honestly I dont know how he hid the smell from me. He even went as far as to buy an ecig so that he could pretend he was going to the bathroom but really be taking a puffs from that. When I found out I blew up. Who cares if he smokes? Thats his own problem but the lying is what was the problem. Why would you hide something like that? He told me it was because he felt awful about it and didnt want to tell me because he did want me to think less of him for it. I thought he could kick the habit without me ever finding out. He said it was because he didnt want to lose me. Ugh it makes me sick now thinking about how he once again turned it into woe is me.Shortly after that incident at his birthday party I went through his phone. He always had it locked and on password and when I saw that it was just open curiosity got the best of me. I found facebook messages to a handful of girls. Some I had never even heard of before. One in particular was a former piano student of his. She was  so why would he be talking to her right? I read those messages and about fainted with anger. He had been talking with this girl telling her how beautiful she was and how he wished that when he had the chance to have sex with her last summer that he would have. He also talked of how I didnt satisfy his needs in bed. And ask her if she could. Often times when I was laying in bed asleep right next to him. I took a big blow my self confidence after reading those things.  It was emotional cheating and I had never dealt with that before. I blew up and stormed out of his party where he proceeded to cry in the snow saying if I ever left him he would have nothing without me and he was just going to kill himself. I couldnt leave him at the moment after what he just said. I couldnt let him kill himself right? I was dumb and I stayed that night while we talked and cried together. I had never seen someone so remorseful and shook up. It scared me. We talked all night and eventually decided I would give him a second chance if he would change majorly. He even did change for the better. He was such a better boyfriend after and I believed him when he said he had changed. He got rid of all of his social media and was totally committed to being a better person in general. Fast forward after a few months of honeymoon bliss his bands manager told him he had to get facebook back so he could advertise for their shows. I got very worried immediately because thats how he communicated to the other girls in the first place. But when he did get Facebook back he didnt download the app on his phone. He would just sign in through the web browser app. Should have been a red flag right then and there for me. He was doing that so I couldnt log into his account as easily. He became distant again and I asked him if he was talking to other girls again. He got very hurt by me even asking that and made me feel guilty when I told him I had the urge to look through his phone while he was asleep. I didnt even do it but yet he said it was a violation of his privacy. Red flag number . I turned into a crazy jealous girlfriend who would spend all my free time looking through his social media account and seeing whose pictures he liked and commented on. It was literally eating me alive. But yet I stayed because I loved him right and how could I possibly not trust him after he had changed so much for the better? If I wanted this relationship to work there had to be trust. Thats the line he fed me. Two weeks ago I got sent a facebook message from a girl we will call F. Fs boyfriend had sent me screen shots of the conversations she has been having with my boyfriend. Right away before even reading the message I knew who the girl was. I had stalked her Instagram before trying to see why my boyfriend was friends with a  year old girl. Being a piano teacher I knew he was still in contact with some of his students.  I didnt think anything of her because why would my  year old boyfriend be interested in a child. Wrong. He had been sexting her like crazy for months just as I had suspected he had been. Very vulgar things too. He told her how he looked at her pictures on Instagram and jerked off to it. Illegal shit. And every red flag I had ignored popped up in my head.Moral of the story just because someone tells you you are his soulmate and one true love doesnt mean you should put up with his shit. I should have noped the fuck out of there as soon as he said he loved me and sent me dick pictures before we met. But he was wildly attractive and in a band and he was feeding my lines I had been always waiting to hear from a man. I was a victim of his mental abuse and I will be a much stronger person after this shit storm. Its really hard right now to believe it will get better but I know that someday I hopefully will be able to be with a man who treats me with respect. I will no longer let a man walk all over me.

And she was content with us just focusing on ourselves but she wanted to stay in contact because she still loved me and so we could be together in the future. I was confused as to why she wanted it to stay as just talking because  days before that she was the one begging me for us to get back together. I couldnt pull the trigger on it at the time because right before she was begging she was telling me how much resentment and anger she still had against me for things in our past. So I stuck with her just talking but that only lasted  days because it was way too hard for me. I told her we needed to get back together or I couldnt keep talking like this. I dont think she took me quite seriously because we both had goals to end up with eachother but I couldnt change her mind.

3326846,0,t3_2y9icc,She is a cunt. There. I said it. She is a fucking cunt. Dont be suicidal. Shes going to use that guy up and shes going to mistreat him. Shes an absolutely horrible person. If I recall correctly she was the one that was being super trashy about you guys after you broke up and started talking shit on reddit. Your life is going to be awesome. Shes going to end up being the town bike that no one gives a shit about. I dont tend to believe in karma but its moments like this when I wish that it was real. Im not huge on redpilllingo but the cock carousel is going to get old and when it gets old and when she wants her right guy hes not going to be there for her.,ExNoContact,cp7hkv7,8,t5_319jr

I despise my ex just as much as you do and theres nothing I wouldnt give to tell her off and make sure she knows how bad she fucked up this relationship. Its not worth it. Shes not worth it. Repeat that to yourself Shes not worth itIt sounds like you may be depressedhave you tried getting on meds? I did and it made a world of difference in addition to CBT.

3342103,0,t3_2yga6c,Wait so he texted you basically saying he wanted to use you for sex and then leave and you not only replied but you told him you missed him and love him? Noooooo no no. Look I know its tough. I was in a similar relationship and every day I wonder how he could go from seemingly caring about me so much to not giving a shit. But then I realize that he fed off of my attention. He loved having someone who loved him and would do anything for him and it made him feel good about himself. It sounds like your ex is doing this. The harsh truth is he doesnt care about you. If he cared about you he wouldnt have said those things. If you went no contact after the break up it probably hurt his self esteem because he was expecting you to text him every day telling him how you cant possibly live without him hes everything to you you miss him etc. By contacting you telling you he wants to fuck you with no other commitments hes checking to see if youre still so strung up on him that you would give him exactly what he wants without expecting any sort of commitment or effort on his part. It makes him feel just great about himself. He can meet other girls while still fucking his ex whos hopelessly in love with him. Dont fall into this trap. Ignore him. I promise you there are attractive men out there who are so much more worthwhile than he is. The more time you waste pining after this asshole the longer it will take for you to open up to the idea of meeting someone new. Dont give your ex this power. Show him hes not worth your time. Focus on you because that is all that matters right now. Eventually youll see that he really wasnt worth your time and eventually youll be a lot happier. Youll have your ups and downs youll regret ignoring him and youll have lonely nights where you think Well I have nothing else to do so maybe I should accept his sexonly offer. Dont do it. Every time youre in contact with him it will set you further back. Take it one day at a time and stay strong. Im rooting for you! ,ExNoContact,cp983b5,11,t5_319jr

I found the sidebar links Breakup Recovery Guide very useful. Read through it if you havent already. He decided to forget about you and that sucks. He gave you up and thats his loss. The person you loved is in the past now. Why should you have to convince someone to be with you? Why should you care about someone who doesnt care about you? You deserve better.

I did so much and sacrificed so much for her that I was emotionally financially and physically drained. I gained a ton of weight and if she had her way once the court shit was over with she would have never spoke to me again. I called HER while I was at work. She did not answer. I called her again a few hours later it was her day off work and a WEEK after my birthday last year and she started sobbing and broke up with me. Not even a month later she started dating some guy in his s with two teenage kids his daughter is  my ex is . She most definitely was seeing this guy at the tail end of our relationship.

Think about this why would you wanna be FRIENDS with someone who didnt think twice about playing fast and loose with you or about treating you like crap? By being friends with her youre essentially telling her that what she did really wasnt that bad in the scheme of things. Thats what I figured when the guy I used to know tried to play the friend card with me. Nope.

3767870,0,t1_cqlrapz,So some facts about Narcissists and what you can expectThey will label people as they service to the narcissist like calling their mother their chef or maid. Constantly no care or affection unless they are fulfilling the role the Narcissist sees.They will manipulate and lie constantly. They dont see why people dont just fall in line to their whims but they can be very charismatic with their confidence and assertiveness.They dont like honest opinions about themselves or critique. We all get a little butt hurt for being called out or being told we are wrong. A narcissist will not stand for it. They will have an explosive reaction or outright ignore what doesnt match their world.They will be pleasant so long as you serve them. Narcissists dont like it when people dont cater to them hand and foot. They see people outside their control as either some shade of awful or ignore them. They will only interact with those that are useful to their needs and love nice people who will bend over backwards to please them.Frankly IMO I find narcissists to be worse than sociopaths. While a sociopathic person has a lot of similarities they tend to push people away with their reckless disregard for society. Whereas a Narcissist know that they need people to make serve them. And will do all sorts of awful for that.,ExNoContact,cqlrjvj,2,t5_319jr

I think thats your brain wanting to find signs and clues to get your out of that relationship. It seems to me now that youre struggling with keeping your distance from her and also keeping her away from you. I have a narcissistic ex who keeps texting every day or two to get attention and knowing that I wont deny him and Ill always reply. Your ex reminds me of that. She knows youll be there and make her feel ok. Dont fall into it. BLOCK HER! She will keep messaging you even if you tell her not to. If you think thats too harsh. Just block her for a day or two and see how it feels. Also you need to go to therapy. Im sorry but this is clearly a significant relationship that mustve left you a bit fucked up about women and relationships.

Heres where it gets interestingWhen one person plays such a massive role in your life you start to depend on them for things. Not consciously but you do. Some of these things include selfapproval.Now. This is just an example but think of your ex like a drug. An approval drug. Every time you see him he gives you a hit. Even if hes a dick about it Even just the mere fact that he is your boyfriend gives you a feeling of approval. Now the drug is taken away. Cold turkey. What happens to your moods? Fucked. Self esteem? FUCKED. A lot of abusive relationships work like this. Even though the abuser is fucking abusing you part of you NEEDS to make him like you again. Just to prove to yourself that you are enough. Subconsciously. I see this everywhere.Now you know why you feel this way. But how do you fix this?You need to learn how to cultivate your own good moods your own self esteem and your own self approval. And right now is the perfect time to practice.Ok. Whats my point? You gave him too much power. You made him responsible for your feelings. And he ran away with them.If you dont work on this problem you are going to do the same thing with your next bf.Pick up some self help books. Learn to make yourself happy.

Sorry wont cut it and all hes gonna offer are excuses if he were to try to explain himself. Fuck him. Hes on his own now. Your best bet is to let him go. Lock the door behind him and grieve what you thought you had with him. Grieve what you never got out of him like the support you deserved with that panic attack. Something major happened in my case as well during the holiday season of . The police had to be called and when I heard from him he made it clear he didnt give a shit and instead dished out his usual nastiness at that point. Looking back I think that was one of the major nails in that whole ugly coffin. What happened was wrong and you deserved better out of him.

4474693,0,t3_3ce0c6,The reason why hes throwing a fit about you leaving is because he is controlling and also because its worked for him in the past at some point. Those other girls are welcome to him and you deserved better out of him. Im sure he did have quirks and Im sure there was kindness coming from him but that doesnt make up for his dishonesty and his disrespect towards you. Its ok to miss him and miss what you thought you had but in time youll realize theres nothing worth missing about someone whos betrayed your trust time and time again someone whos left you alone when you were in need and someone whos controlling. The sad truth is you were alone all along and for that Im so sorry.

The past few weeks for me have been until very recently just fine. But I guess thats neither here nor there.I think he is finally seeing his problems but hes been working on it indefinitely and aimlessly for years... it just doesnt mean anything anymore. I wish I could fast forward to the day where he could say not im working on it but i worked through it im a better person now. My therapist told me itd take years of therapy for him to get there. I know I cant expect it in weeks or months. I know I cant expect it ever because its not my place to have expectations anymore not when it comes to him.Its hard. There were some more exchanges including him saying Im sorry I cant make anything better and me calling him out on it saying But you could if you wanted to you just dont want to. Ending in him asking if we can speak on the phone tomorrow. We used to live together he lives  miles away now. I dont know what good can come from this. I am a masochist to ride this out but I am  positive by the end of the week his number will be blocked again. Im trying to just breathe through the conversation that we are having and understand that its part of my healing process that Im learning that the bargaining phase of grief is just a bunch of lies that we have to clean out of our system.

5303697,0,t1_cvpizo1,Youre not sick for craving or indulging in the sadness. In fact its so common that there are even a few schools of thought that attempt to explain it. One exists in spiritual studies and involves the concept of the pain body  the idea than an entity exists within ourselves that actively seeks out this discomfort.Who is not touched by the impact of recurring times of sadness anxiety anger or selfdefeating behaviors?There is an unseen force that causes us to unconsciously seek pain over and over again. Of course no one would do this consciously. No one likes to suffer. And yet we unconsciously create repetitive and unnecessary conflicts.These selfdestructive habit patterns are known as the Pain Body. It is a powerful unconscious force with great momentum. Its purpose is to continue the pattern  to bring us pain. Further science has some explanations for it within psych and neurosci. Just know that its totally normal dont fret. If youd like to learn more about it from this angle I can hook you up with some articles and studies in your inbox. ,ExNoContact,cvplxzb,1,t5_319jr

5323805,0,t3_3npsz8,Wow... this sounds just like my life except the converse Im the Muslim girl and dated a nonMuslim guy. It has been the toughest thing to move on. He was agnostic and searching for faith so I figured he would come around to Islam but I never once pushed it. I did tell him that ultimately he would either have to convert on his own accord or else we would amicably split. After a couple years of studying and us falling more in love he made it clear he could not convert and didnt believe in it. I was crushed. We lingered on anyway semidating but knew it would end. In fact I am quite religious and he was a delicious detour but I needed to get back on track. I broke things off. But not a day passes that I dont think of him. Most days we chat a bit hows your day etc etc? But its terrible and hurtful.He loved me more than anyone I know. And I think he still does. Ive tried to move on these past couple years yes its been awhile but my mind wonders back to him. I have a new bf now to my fault another nonMuslim... I like the new guy a lot but would be lying to say Ive forgotten my ex. The new guy has said he would convert though if things got serious and I have no reason to doubt him... even though Im religious I am not traditional at all and would say my sense of religiosity is very relaxing and not pedantic.Anyway Im venting. Its so incredibly hard to break up when you love each other and a circumstance beyond your control is to fault. I have found myself crying many nights and I am not an emotional being very often. I listen to sad songs and replay memories. Interestingly he contacted me a while back and said he would convert to break up with my current bf. Oh God I contemplated it but I felt that it would be a huge disrespect to my current man to not give him the full chance... although my heart wanders a bit. Besides its been so long it might not be the same with my ex.My advice is accept that her family would never accept you. Trust me Muslims are very demanding and judgmental usually. They have very high standards for their daughters and depending on the nationality might view you with much suspicion my dad is a convert white male so it has been a bit easier for me to be honest about my relationships. That said if you truly truly love her not just lust with ALL your heart fight harder. Us Muslim girls are not robots and if the man finds a way and God wills for it it can work. Perhaps if you are able you can convert for her. Now I know youre an atheist but maybe you can search the deep recesses of your soul and find some little semblance of faith in a higher power intelligent design something? If so... now this sounds very bad you could convert it takes  seconds try your best to follow the rituals tell her you believe and basically live a lie. I think most people would feel bad doing that but if you are capable and you feel you must be with her that is the only way. I just wouldnt tell her its completely fake. I would say something like I believe in God or some power. I agree with a lot of the morals. I will have a hard time following it perfectly but will try my best. And then fake it the best you can.... maybe some faith will enter your heart maybe not. But dont let her know you are atheist deep down or maybe let her know if she will accept you... just so long as she gets her familys approval.Good luck.,ExNoContact,cvs6f2k,0,t5_319jr

5928556,0,t3_3wjyek,Im so sorry to hear this happened to you and also sorry this was your baseline zero for relationships. What happened to you was wrong on every level there is and you deserved so much better than this. You put in so much effort to impress him keep him happy and keep him interested in you and this was how he repaid all your efforts. This says a lot about the kind of guy he really is and speaks to how totally undeserving he was of a catch like you. It sounds like you may have been dealing with someone whos personality disordered in the Cluster B category based on him using hideous words to call you out of your name saying awful things about what you thought you had with him and then leaving you for someone else this quickly. Most people who fit the criteria for this subset of disorders will never get a formal diagnosis because they dont see anything wrong with themselves or the shit they do. If he isnt then either way hes super toxic to you and your kid. If you can fight for sole custody do so. If his history with others who believed in him before you is anything to go by I cant imagine any judge worth their salt doing anything but giving you sole custody. Make sure you document everything and keep communication by email only. Communication needs to be shop talk only regarding visitations. Its common for abusers to weasel their way onto the good side of a survivors family while abusing the survivor behind their back. Its part of their con to keep the survivor isolated and when the survivor tries to tell them theyre not always believed. By doing this he abused your family too. Nice move by him huh? Not! Can you reach out to your family and tell them at least the basics of what this guys done to you? If so do it ASAP. Youve been through a lot and your feelings toward a new relationship are completely understandable. After he discarded me I felt like it would be too soon if I never even considered another guy. Now Im close to being able to consider another relationship for the most part but I still have my moments once in a blue moon. This guys taken whatever trust you had in him and in guys in general and done a lot of damage to it. That will take time to heal from. Youll get to a point in your healing where you relearn to trust yourself again and thats important. Your trust in others wont come easy anymore and thats a good thing. Trust is earned not owed. Safe people will be happy to show you they can be trusted whereas those who mean you no good will either get nasty with you or storm off. Let them. Trusting others is a bridge youll cross when you get there. Right now your priority is your kid and yourself. Take it one day at a time and reach out to your support system. If you dont have one then a good place to reach out to is www.thehotline.org. They can put you in touch with local resources to look into for support and even legal help. Weve got your back here and youre gonna make it through this. As one survivor to another I believe in you. ,ExNoContact,cxwrjos,2,t5_319jr

Maybe changing your number to one thats unlisted and unpublished would be a good next step to take. This way he cant try to contact you again. This was not a normal breakup or a healthy relationship. Friendship isnt something thats owed even if this was a healthy relationship and youre not responsible for him. He probably made you feel like you were or like you were beholden to him in some way like you had to do whatever or else.

It starting off on a bad foot was not a good omen but I dont think it needs to be a thing that defines the relationship.However I get the sense that there is this pushpull dynamic that was going on in your relationship. You would each take turns one would pull the other towards them while the other was pushing away.  Id strongly recommend no contact just on that basis alone. You both need time to figure out why that dynamic was there. As passionate and wonderful as you two were when the times were good there was something unhealthy going on. Its untrue that going no contact will destroy any potential chance at a reconciliation down the line.   I would contend in fact your best chance at a LASTING reconciliation would be to take time away to figure out yourself let him figure out himself.  You both need to heal emotionally and you cant heal being in constant contact with each other  as long as one or both of you is resenting the other.Do no contact. Give him  days  months  months a year to think about you. Miss you. Figure out how he can be better in his next relationship while you figure out how to be be better in your next relationship.

6457052,0,t3_443ow1,Man I envy you. It took me months to start learning things about myself. Specifically the good things.I dont know if it was something I learned but rerealized everything good about me. After months of being in a really depressed place I finally was able to look in the mirror tell and most importantly BELIEVE in what I was telling myself that I have so much to offer and Im very capable of getting a girl who is a winner and will put me first like I put the girl in my past. That translated into dropping any kind of alcohol consumption completely and hitting the gym. I lost the bad beer weight got very toned and my self confidence was strong again. I was on a nice wave.Things I learned that are hard to swallow to this day...I was incredibly naieve. I let her linger around in my life for too long I shouldve gone NC her way before it got to the point that it did that may have cost me from ever hearing from her again.,ExNoContact,czn7akj,2,t5_319jr

Am I that bad of a person that you would have to stop me from communicating with you? Maybe I was and here I am trying my best to make amends. It is all I can do.Thank you for your support. I requested for her to call to me tonight via email. She has not responded and I dont know if she will call but I dont think it matters at this point.

Have you finally accepted that it will never work? I have been coming home every day crying and telling myself that there is nothing I can do without compromising myself. For me  it has been very therapeutic because I want to solve problems and am committed. In a sense we are people that like control. We cannot let things be and sometimes we have to acknowledge that some things are not broken they just dont fit. Peace be with you. ,ExNoContact,czpi6u7,1,t5_319jr

6583491,0,t3_45u7ud,Im sorry youre going through this  the high of marriage and the low of divorce in such a short timespan must be incredibly taxing. GIGS isnt a clinical diagnosis. Its just something people on some forums have cooked up to explain certain behaviour patterns as far as Im concerned its the same thing as a life crisis which often happens in late teensearly twenties. There may or may not be merit to it but its problematic because youre trying to make sense of something without any real information. The fact is theres no way for you to know what your ex wife is thinking or feeling and theres certainly no way for us to know. If GIGS seems to be a good fit then sure go with that but just be careful to not obsess over behaviours and things she said to try to paint a cohesive picture of something that may not have any cohesion at all. At this stage you need to be concerned with yourself and how youre feeling rather than what your ex iswas thinking and feeling.,ExNoContact,d00acf4,3,t5_319jr

I think that they all can ultimately be summed up with one question  Who are you?Youre trying to come to grips with the fact that your ex is not the person that you thought they were.  As far as you knew you were dating a good person and good people shouldnt be capable of doing such shitty things to the people they love.Talking to him about this is not going to help.  From the sound of it hes a liar so you wouldnt be able to trust his responses anyway.  For myself I eventually just had to accept that I badly misjudged his character and he wasnt the man that I thought he was.

6725055,0,t3_47pma5,Ive been lurking on here for awhile. Havent had the confidence to post yet but this is a post I can relate to. My relationship ended about  weeks ago and I am in the same situation. Its really hard to walk away from an year relationship and pretend to be strangers. She told me the same exact thing. Its hard to think rationally right now but dont trust her words. Were desperate right now and our brains are still wired to crave them. The ball is in their court we didnt walk away from the relationship. They did. If they want to be in your life then let them prove it. Trust actions not words. For now FOCUS ON YOURSELF! Take this time to improve your life. Find purpose. I try telling myself this every day. If you really want her back you need to change as well. They arent going to want the old you back but the new you is a different story. Who knows the new you may not want her back. Give it time. For now we need to heal learn and focus on moving forward.

6767045,0,t3_48epye,Great list but you are doing far better than many and facing your problems really well. I think it is an inspirational list I could add my own things. I want to forget and I am at week  but my brain keeps spinning and whenever I am contacted in any manner I go through a smaller nervous breakdown even when I do not respond and the one time I wrote back led to a worse one. NC all the way and keep it because if you break it either you fall off the wagon or it will be an emotional vomit depending on where you are at the moment. The one time I responded was firm but polite and nice BUT I wish it contained the uncensored truth sometimes and I also wish that I had said nothing took me a long time to forgive myself ror responding do not break NC! I find it impossible to block you cannot block email and when I did I only kept checking spam nonstop or I get a text from a family member and I WANT to know if they want to say sorry. While it may never happen I am unable to block it only drives me more nuts. At the same time I am relieved when I am left alone like since my response but that made me doubt myself a million times because he was pretty much begging for a chance and then never responded yes twice to thank me for responding and how difficult it was not to talk to me but that was it. Do not feed their egos. Try to feed yours.  find it impossible as usual to not see the other sex. I agree with staying alone but I cannot. I need a substitute crutch now and that is ok too. I too made a resolution that I would not but it helps me to connect and it helps my confidence. I cry a couple of times very cleaning and feel so good the next day other days I feel the end has come. It is much worse than I thought it would be considering I ended it but it really was him by rejecting me and going back on his word it is also slightly better than I thought. First two weeks not seeing my Whatsapp light up with texts or calls from him were almost unbearable I kept trying to predict when you would call only to find never. Acceptance came yesterday when a family member of his wrote instead of him. I did not want to live anymore and then it passed after a huge breakdown. Now I accept that he is gone and he will never try reconciling and saying sorry and he does not resent losing me. I need to stop family members too etc. It stirs me up too much. It bothers me that his stuff is still here it is unfinished business and he is unwilling to say anything about it very valuable things. I know he will I hope not for another week I need time for my huge work project. The project is helping right now keeping my brain occupied is great but it wanders off a lot. Sorry for the unedited thoughts and the novel surely I could add a lot more. BTW just so you see the other side being the dumper can hurt just as much as being the dumpee if you loved the person and thought shehe was the one but they humiliated you rejected you in a certain way and because you keep doubting yourself since you made that decision.A very important revelation I loved an illusion not the real person. That said I still miss the real person as hell with all his faults.,ExNoContact,d0jborp,2,t5_319jr
6769628,0,t3_48hdnq,Speaking from personal experience long term relationships very rarely last if your SO has conflicts with your close friends and family. It will create a constant strain on your relationship by forcing you to pick sides all the time. Reading over all this youve written it doesnt sound like the two of you are good for each other....and its more of the natural doubt and fear of regret thats making you wonder about getting back together. ,ExNoContact,d0jm9j1,1,t5_319jr
6811883,0,t3_491cgk,Mine was also an almost relationship hasnt been any less painful than an actual relationship ending. I strongly recommend block him delete all photoschats get out with friends and constantly stay busy. The days get easier although some days will be really tough. The reason you dont want to block him is you still harbour hope. You believe your situation is different and maybe it will happen. It wont. You need to let go. What you miss most is not him its the loneliness of not chatting with him. That time you used to fill with shared laughter is currently empty you need to fill it with something else. It will get better I promise. You know it too. The fastest way to heal is to get him out of your life completely. The beginning is really hard but by the end you heal faster. ,ExNoContact,d0of9wu,2,t5_319jr
6855597,0,t3_49n6oa,I can relate albeit in a bit of a different way. I lost my actual best friend nine months ago to a freak accident. Ive been in a funkdepressionwhatever you want to call it since. Of course some days are fine or even surprisingly great and some days are the absolute worst. Youll never fill that void youll just find a new normal...youll have other friends and relationships that fulfill you in different ways youll try to find gratitude and peace knowing that you had a great relationship or a relationship that was once great. Mourn the loss and grieve it. Ive found myself both withdrawing from everything and everyone and trying to find that missing piece but I think all around its kind of futile. Theres nothing wrong with seeking connection but youll have to accept and resign yourself to the fact that people come and go and they change and youre lucky to have experienced something special for some amount of time. Ideally itd be forever but life is weird. People who want to stick around will stick around. My ex was that for a while but as time went on I think it fizzled and then it was grass is greener and his issues taking over.  Its ok to miss that connection  it shows that youre human that youre experiencing. I think we can all take the time to focus on ourselves and really identify our needs. My goal is to dig a little deeper and be able to find more peace within and with myself.  ,ExNoContact,d0te22y,2,t5_319jr

So he got rid of me fairly easily as I have a policy of being incredibly easy to get rid of if you dont want to be with me.

7326041,0,t3_4fo7rz,You are most definitely not alone in fact I can really relate. I think what happened to you is that you did not allow yourself to heal after your ex husband cheated on you but rebounded too soon and thus creating a cycle of failed relationships losses and heartaches. What happens then? You feel all the losses at once the old wounds reopen too and it is overwhelming especially with him calling too.The reason I can relate is because almost  years ago I had the most horrible BU with my ex fiancee I went into crazy dating and soon after married an abusive and con artist guy whom I wanted to divorce quickly but could not.Anyhow long story short I finally got that it was really really hard again long story but by then I had fallen for a friend of mine with whom we started a relationship and fell in love. Before him I even reconnected with ex fiancee but it was for no good.Now I have been grieving the BU with this latest boyfriend who severely burnt me out. Of course I am feeling all the losses. I am fighting through grief about ex fiancee and ex boyfriend too. The marriage no that caused me grief in other ways.But my point is that do not go haywire in dating or relationships you should have perhaps given yourself a bit more time because even if you do not choose the wrong type of guys which you may have most relationships would still be destined to failure since you are not healed. Maybe consider counseling but support you can get from us here you can PM me too you can use the chat room we are here for you.,ExNoContact,d2ax5j4,1,t5_319jr

7345178,0,t3_4fuhyi,Well I have ADD. I have several degrees because I do well when I do several things at once only. Studying while talking for example. That is one form the better one as I am incredibly fast although I need to stand up and leave what I am doing every half an hour or so. The jobs I had understood eventually as I was performing more than those who did not need to do this. Unfortunately some forms of ADD people cannot even finish one task and it is really difficult to learn. Just like I cannot sit in one place or work on a project without internet shopping or whatever at the same time. Not really our faults disciplining ourselves is really hard.I do great at difficult projects but I cannot work as a secretary as I am not capable of forming simple tasks like scanning. I cannot do administration and everyday tasks beat me but a government project gets my attention and it is not a problem. Does that make me a lesser person and does your being a bit different make you a lesser person? Just because we are each unique?Listen this guy you have to realize that he was really abusive severely emotionally abusive. You are the best off without him. You should stop contacting him now and be happy that you have the opportunity to eventually meet someone that deserves you.You may be a bit depressed. You were without a job much of your life and it will take time but see the progress you are already making? You should be proud of yourself that you rid yourself of these guys and have a job. You will be fine but you must realize that your worth does not depend on these guys who were really draining you. Please try to work on learning to love yourself. Consider therapy. There are many forms that really help.,ExNoContact,d2d3gqj,2,t5_319jr

7366007,0,t3_4g6msj,I am in a very similar situation as you. Minus the part about my ex hooking up with someone although she may be but Id rather not know. Going on  days of NC. Its hard. Very hard. Hardest thing Ive had to go through. However you begin to notice each week is easier than the last. Me and my girl were great together also. Got along very well with her family and Im my exs first boyfriend. Relationship fell apart because I got comfortable it got complacent and Im stopped courting her. Yes I still hope we get back together but I am not going to wait on her. Ive realized even if she did come back right now I would not be happy like used to be. Theres already been too much damage. Our paths WILL cross again so I plan to use these next few months to be the best person I can be and gain some indifference. Its a winwin for you and youll essentially come to the mindset that its her loss.  You need to find your own happiness and get your confidence back. I suggest reading The Power of Now. Itll help with the anxiety. And also Corey Wayne videos on youtube may help but just try to LIVE life. Youre probably and great guy and there IS someone out there thats going to value you and degrade you. Learn from your mistakes. Read How to be a  percent man. It has good advice for startingbuilding future relationships. If you and your girl DO cross paths then itll have to be a NEW relationship. So that means you have to become a new and improve you ... Good luck and know your not alone on this one. If you have any questions Im happy to help as for some reason talking about it can help you gain clarity ,ExNoContact,d2fgpyc,1,t5_319jr

Second to that  take up a new hobby.  I found online dating only made things much MUCH worse for me.  I was constantly fretting about whether people liked me how I could get people to like me... oy.  It can be rough on the selfesteem.  Especially when you get desired but only from emotionally unavailable people who dont really want to take the time to get to know the person.  Maybe keep a feelings journal note your mood every hour or so.  That way you can learn your patterns  what makes you feel good? What makes you feel bad?  And focus on doing more of the good things which are usually healthy and positive and less of the bad.You WILL get there. I know you probably dont believe it. I didnt believe I would either.

I mean all the merits of a relationship without status is upsetting so I was like enough of this.I figured since I have tinder and someone else I sleep with Ill be ok but anyway she has contacted me teice in a matter of  days after I just told her that she is free to do whatever she likes but I want to move on and I dont want her to contact me.Ahould I respond to her?

Everywhere I go am reminded of her. My office desk reminds me of her. The things we did on that desk.. Memorable and irreplaceable. Can never forget how every moment felt. Everywhere I go am haunted by our sweet memories. The mall the cafe the park the toothbrush we shared even seeing a couple together reminds me of her. It hurts dont have friends who understand my situation no one has time for emotional gabbage. Its harder for me than I expected. You gotta push yourself ahead bro or life will flush you out like toilet paper. Thats what Ive learned during this time. Only you can help yourself. No one else will understand the magnitude of your pain than you. Am weeks old with no contact. Trying as much as I slip to build back my stamina Watching motivational stuff audio programs.

While I cant speak definitively to whats going on with them it isnt right that theyre making you feel like this. If you feel like you can talk to them about it do so but otherwise if you feel like this is a dealbreaker then thats what it is. I can tell you for a fact that you made the right choice in going NC with him. As it says in the sidebar NC is about you not them. Whether this guy was setting the stage for more to come later on or whether or not he was a gardenvariety jerk he wasnt healthy to you and thats what matters here. It sounds like he was calling the shots in this relationship and that it was always on his terms not yours. Thats not right at all.

Now I dont know what will happen. I have been very emotional today but I just had a realization as well. She showed me that I could love so much more than I knew before. She doesnt want that love and it hurts but I know someone who is able to receive it will be very happy with it.

I am curious about what my description will be for the next girl. Not something that I really need to worry or be concerned about though!I didnt respond to him and he reached out to me again. This time via Tinder asking if Id swiped right on accident. I shouldve left it but of course I didnt. I reminded him that I had been honest about wanting to be with him. He was the one that didnt want to be with me. And then of course he never responded. He just wanted to get a rise out of me and to be reassured. Which I didnt disappoint.

I on the other hand couldnt be as cordial and decided to unfriend and block. I tried to unfollow him initially but it would so painful just to see if he had posted new pictures of himself smiling with his friends or with a new special girl. I made the decision to unfriend him then even with just his profile picture would bring on emotions of sadness and what ifs. He never had a picture of us as a profile picture so I figured if theres a picture of him with a girl it must serious and once again I would be heart broken.

Youre right that its a horribly destructive habit it might make me happy for a moment but it makes me feel much emptier in the long run. And it adds a sense of confusion I dont understand why hed want to view what I was up to but not have wanted to contact me.gt I wasnt worth working for. I wasted  years of my time beauty and energy on a person who dropped in and out of my life as it suited him and who didnt value me enough to try.I feel like this is so relatable to me too! Its just confusing to me because when he accepted the job abroad for a year we he sat me down and he told me he wanted to make it work. I didnt pressure him. The next few months were punctuated by probably the most intense romance of our entire relationship.I still have messages from a week before he broke up with me telling me he wanted to marry me that he never wanted to be without me that he wanted a future with me that I didnt know how much I meant to him that he couldnt imagine ever being without me. And its so hard understanding what changed in a week that he made all these assurances off of his own back I never once brought these things up first. What made him suddenly decide all of that was redundant and all of a sudden I wasnt worth working for or waiting for.This was a week before he left for abroad and I saw him once I cried and he comforted me and told me it wasnt the end. He told me he wanted me in his life. I told him he didnt mean it and he said hed prove it hed talk to me when he got there. He still hasnt. And it hurts so much because I believed him.Im going to try and muster the strength to delete. Im so fed up of waking up unhappy and going to sleep unhappy. And Im so confused.

Absolutely no chance at all.But to answer your question he contacted me  days after he ghosted me through a friends facebook account I blocked him everywhere. Telling me that he always loved me and he never loved the girl that he ghosted me for and she was terrible in bed and blahblahblah. He asked if there was a chance for us and I told him I that I needed time to think about it. Two days later he was pushing me for a decision and essentially saying that he wouldnt wait around forever. After  days of wondering what the hell I did wrong and attempting to heal and almost getting to an okay place I told him it would never work. That was  days ago now. I still wonder what if. But I never want to hear from him again. I no longer hate him but I have no interest in being a part of his life or him in mine. I actually think Im at the point where I wish him well.

8232687,0,t3_4s4b38,I had a pretty great weekend! Spent all of it with my best friends. I did a wine and coloring night Friday and we hung out by the pool at my friends house. Last night I went to go see my all time favorite artist Jon Bellion at his concert and it was fantastic. Today my friends and I are going to help one of my friends adopt a kitten from the shelter. She is recently going through a breakup and really wants something to give her love and comfort right now. ,ExNoContact,d56n47d,3,t5_319jr
8273198,0,t1_d5bmjko,The dreams suck I know that problem all too well. Mine kept it to texts too. I gave her every out and tried to make it easy for her at my expense emotionally.Sometimes it just ends and though I can say at least you have beautiful memories all they do is make the hurt fester. But I dont regret it I regret losing her but not meeting her. She brought a lot into my life and the end of the relationship only makes me want to be better.When I fall in love again Ill be better equipped and thats whats important to remember. Not that you loved and lost but that you made mistakes and you can be better next time.The dreams will slowly become fewer. The hurt will fade. It will still suck but you dont have to think that your life will always be so bad without them. Do try and pick and choose your emotional suffering. Wherever it comes to the arguments you have with their memory remember it wont do anything but hurt. Because thinking you can fix it means nothing. It only makes you linger. I fall into the habit myself tool I think if she lived me if she wanted it to work she would have tried. You cant convince a ghost and change the present. You shouldnt have to fight to make someone recognize love. If they cant see it you shouldnt be with them. They will always make you feel like a failure in the end when the fault is their own fickle emotions.,ExNoContact,d5bpiqc,1,t5_319jr

8423733,0,t3_4v0wzv,First of all youll be okay! Please remember people present themselves in a certain light online. It doesnt represent the whole truth of their life. Hes not going to post photos of himself crying alone in the shower. You have done great so far. You will move forward the world is still spinning and you still have your own life with your own photos new memories friends etc. Second that heart pounding and shaking is from anxiety. It means you arent over this experience but the good news is that you are moving along!Third why do you do that to yourself? Dont answer me thats a deeper personal question for yourself. And honestly thats the direction you should be thinking. You should be thinking about yourself not him. Heres what helps me to me my ex is the past. I cant change the past.  I cant change his or my decisions from our time together. I cannot change what he chooses to do now. Its a worthless effort. However I can focus on the present and the future. Within those limits if Im not choosing to focus on myself then I am limiting my possibilities growth future relationships opportunities support for those who care about me. I am purposefully causing myself pain. Do I deserve that? I dont think so. I loved how I was able to in that relationship. I will do better next time. I wont even worry about his next time or try very hard to anyway it has nothing to do with me. The person I loved is a relic and will not be there if I ever see or hear from him again. He will be much different he will act much different. And really if he wanted me he would be with me. If he wants me in the future he will contact me. In the meantime out of respect for MYSELF and for the love I hadhave for him I will keep my distance and allow us both to handle this separation in our own ways. I will give him privacy and keep my own. We dont really believe we deserve to be hurt by other people so why do we choose to hurt ourselves? Its a struggle and a hard question to answer. I think this is what they mean by break ups causing people to grow and regress. We can choose which direction we move. Good luck and best wishes. ,ExNoContact,d5uib4l,3,t5_319jr

8442721,0,t3_4va3pd,ZD you are in a funk. It is ok. This is grief. It takes different people different amounts to grieve.Im sorry that your friends and family dont seem to be there for you. People get uncomfortable seeing us hurt. I think they simply dont know how to respond at some point. Its sucky because wed hope they would show more empathy  Keep posting here. I wont get tired of you! You can even pm me if you need to.I hope that you are allowing yourself to feel what you feel. Im a few months into this process and I told my therapist that I was angry with myself for still struggling. She said that the struggle didnt mean a lack of progress It just meant that I was beating myself up for feeling. Its ok to feel what you feel. You are not on a timeline.You are not a loser and I know that you know that.Have you ever made a vision board? I started making one recently and its really helped. I think that when we fall for someone it is easy to reimagine our lives with them in it and terribly difficult to remember that we are people with dreams and aspirations that dont include the ex after the relationship ends. I have pictures and quotes that fit into the categories of career health finances and relationships. I am focusing on what I want my future to look like. For the relationship category I have chosen to focus on selflove at this time as it is clear that I have not been treating myself kindly...hence me allowing someone else to treat me unkindly.It has really helped me to focus on MY future. For a while it felt hopeless but now I am seeing the light. I get an opportunity to make this life what I want it to be. It sucks that it doesnt include my ex but I refuse to believe that being with my ex is as good as things will ever get. The same goes for you. Find hope in the tiniest thing. That doesnt mean that you are going to love every aspect of your life right away it just means that you will start to pull yourself out of this hole bit by bit.Hang in there!,ExNoContact,d5wvnhl,3,t5_319jr

Just because you know shes viewing your stuff you will subconsciously post things that will show you in a better light or make her jealous. Honestly a two month relationship is nothing. Shes  youre . You came on a little strong for her young immature head so she wanted out. Time for you to see that and move on. Delete her ass because you are upset every time you see her name pop up under your story watchers. The best way to pique someones curiosity is to drop off the face of the earth.

8539776,0,t1_d68ur4y,Thank you for the kind words. I hope to eventually enjoy those things for me again but the memories attached to them are still fresh so I avoid those things like the plague. If one of these songs pops up at work its an immediate skip for me and the entire office groans because lets face it we both had great taste in music. Oh well.High Fidelity is a superb movie. It was the first movie that helped me to start to form an opinion on things like love and relationships this opinion evolves because you know life and stuff but there are still roots that come from that movie. Ive always seen myself as a Rob but to be completely honest I always see myself as whatever character John Cusack is playing in any movie. The dude resonates with me for some reason.As far as me speaking highly about my ex Im actually surprised how people respond to this. I guess its because its not the normal thing to do? I dont know I look at life linearly a series of cause and effects. People dont just stay in the past for me I carry pieces of them wherever I go because the lessons that people bring to your life should never stay in the past. I am always thankful for those lessons and they tend to always be a positive thing. They shared their life with you and yours with them. It makes no difference how long our paths intersect theres always going to be a strong effect. Were all just asteroids tumbling in space until we collide into another asteroid that adjusts our path to something new. We become new because of that person. So why do I think highly of her? Because the way I see it theres no reason not to. My ex was a bitch mentality doesnt help me heal because that is rooted in anger and if I continue that Im only giving her more power over my life. Although shes a different person now I dont think our breakup and the hurt diminishes her beauty. We all have flaws she has hers and I have mine and to be honest I was the one that caused us to break up. I was the villain in this story. But thats life cause and effect. I still experienced her love and that was a thing of beauty from a beautiful person and yes I often give myself reality checks to make sure Im not putting her on a pedestal. I feel like our emotional shells change over time but our emotional core stays constant throughout all of the changes. I think of it as an emotional compass. Her love and caring came from her core it was an extension of who she is and that will always be there. Its not available to me anymore but it still exists. Its like an old flower you admired so much that you pressed it in a book. Its all dried up now but its still a beautiful thing. I think we do things like this because in a world of ugliness we do our best to hang on to the beauty so we know how to appreciate it when we find it again. Thats why I speak highly of her. ,ExNoContact,d691fzg,1,t5_319jr

8847093,0,t1_d7b4vpe,I agree with ExOnanBarbarian. I even almost wish my ex would be as dickish so I could move on better. You may not realize how much your ex might be helping you by initiating no contact. Really youre still in the phase where youre thinking about what life is like on the other side what hes thinking why hes doing this and that what hes trying to do how you should respond to things to make him feel a certain way etc. and this is gonna end up making you live your life as if all your decisions were involved with or affected by him. You dont want that! Youre your own independent being. If you dont talk to him you can focus on yourself and your life  you can even choose to be selfish in new ways because hes not in the picture! There are so many benefits of no longer being able to contact an ex like that. Contacting him at this point will just be validation that you still care about him that he can use to his advantage. You dont want that either. Basically you dont want him to know what youre feeling or thinking about during this period. Just focus on yourself and continue building your own life separate from his. You will be much happier this way as you learn how to do this on your own. If you need help you have a community of people going through the same thing you are on this subreddit. Theres a lot of hope for an independent future you just gotta try pursuing it. But the first step is being diligent enough to not actively imagine whats going on in his end and to use the time and energy and effort that youre spending thinking about your ex on working hard creating your new life. Much easier said than done but it will all soon fall into place... Best of luck to you!,ExNoContact,d7bamp1,1,t5_319jr

At the end of the day these are just words Im sure the person who said these things actions did not represent any of this. At least thats what Ive learned.Then why say anything at all?Manipulation control false security. Im not sure. Sometimes they say stuff like this because they dont know what else to say. It may sound genuine and feel genuine but then  min later you get criticized for something you did  months ago. It makes you wonder. I cling to words and phrases like this from my ex.

I pushed myself into liking the other girl but It was like trying to push two magnets together with the same poles facing one another. there were other girls but I always thought about her in some way or other.

9058633,0,t3_549c6n,Controversial but I think she did the right thing by leaving Matthew.  Yes he loved her but despite her protestations the lady doth protest too much methinks I dont think she was as happy as she remembers.  God knows Ive been known to look back on my marriage before Painful Ex with similar rosetinted glasses but if shed stayed and god forbid had children the differences in their values wouldve just magnified.  She was a gogetter and he wasnt.  Yes he was a lovely guy Id take him any day of the week! but they werent compatible.  The ending shouldve been amicable and she should have been able to move on and find someone who shared her values but unfortunately I feel that her recovery from the breakup was seriously undermined by her family.  gt My parents were horrified that I was walking away from a man they felt was right for me. My fathers words to me that day continue to haunt me. Karen think carefully about what youre doing. Theres a lot to be said for someone who truly loves you.That is a SHIT family.  They knocked her confidence just when they should have been building it up.  No wonder she clings to Matthews memory and tells herself shell never do better and she missed her chance.  When this asshole came alonggt Richard was repeatedly unfaithfulNo wonder she wasted . years with him.  She didnt have the confidence to kick him to the kerb.  And even if he HADNT been an asshole gt Matthew was never far from my thoughts and Richard complained that I often brought him into conversations even comparing them both.The not letting go wouldve doomed it anyway.  No he definitely shouldnt have cheated but I dont blame him for walking out.Speaking of  why in the name of GOD did she stay with Rob for four years?!gt  I wanted children he had a grownup son and didnt want to start over again.Again... the voices of her family saying Be happy with what youve got youll never do betterPoor woman.  Poor poor woman.  I wish shed been able to come to this forum when Matthew met Sara.  This choked me up...gt  Or maybe Matthew wasnt the right man. lthugsgt He definitely wasnt honey or you wouldnt have left him.gt I will never know  the answer but my decision to leave him has definitely cost me the chance of ever becoming a mother.No youre decision to keep holding onto him cost you maybe the chance of ever becoming a mother.

Same kind of demonstration of love support honest shows of affection and commitment. When that isnt there and they dont even communicate their real selves to you its nothing more than dysfunction. But when you do get the courage to stop the BS after YEARS of caring for them and you NOT being cared for They are devastated. You know why?? They are suffering from a loss of you making them feel good while they didnt feel it necessary to esteem you in any way at all. Its a complete and utter validation of the truth that eventually emerged YOU had nothing then and you have nothing now.Some people are completely clueless at how they destroy relationships.

She has a huge identity crisis and right now she is with someone she doesnt love and calls that relationship a lie and a mistake so I feel like she will try to go back to her old self sooner or later and I dont know what to do if she comes back to me the way I fell in love with her.

I couldnt understand why she left until literally just now. I understand what she wants and shes not ready to get into anything serious. And for the longest time I thought it was just me then I thought she had just been toying with my emotions. Depression does stuff like that to you you just get blinded with feelings that you sort of distort the obvious and look for something else to justify your hurt. She never meant to hurt me. We were both just scared I suppose. I wish her all the best and o hope she finds everything shes looking for. I will never stop loving her.

9906310,0,t1_dayrnpp,Hmmm... maybe.I must admit I find it odd because hes had a Reddit account for  years and has only ever posted a handful of times before. And its strange hed be so showy and label his relationship so much in the title of the posts isnt it?I told my sister about it and she said maybe hes trying to make the rebound happy by calling him his boyfriend to try and prove something to him.Ugh. I wouldnt even be as angry if wed had zero contact as Id just think fair enough hes moved on. But hes said he misses me more than once. Hes texted me  times in the last month and I only responded to the first one. Its so messed up isnt it?,ExNoContact,daytd8w,1,t5_319jr
9941565,0,t3_5hv394,Sorry youre going through this tough time.Were all here feeling crushed. Im glad you realize youll get over it and for that to happen there is no reason to expect anything more from her. She has blocked you because she is trying to heal without you. You need to see this as a good thing which i know seems impossible but she clearly wants to move on regardless of what youve been through together. Now you know that it is over for good you need to take the opportunity to heal yourself on your own without her. Its hard to fathom but her no contact can be a blessing in disguise. Honestly the nicest thing she can do for you is disappear without a trace. It will allow you to forget about her and move on without being fed false hope from her contacting you.I feel from your post that you still feel like she owes you things. Owes you her affection concern explanations. You will put yourself through hell and self torture waiting for her to give you what you want. She no longer gets to be that person that youve been best friends with. She made that decision when she ended it. When you talked to her friend and she said offhandedly mentioned your ex will probably contact you again. Not sure when. That wasnt fucking okay  what if I finally got over her and she popped up suddenly in my life?Thats exactly the stress you need to avoid. Assume that she will never contact you again. and if she does you need to not ignore her. Why?  Remember what she put you through what shes capable of doing to you. You deserve someone to love you for you whole heartedly. Anything less will never feel safe. Your insecurities will swell even if she did come back. Shes proved she cant be trusted to be responsible with your heart. There are far better out there who will treat it better.In your post you said shes not fulfilling her promises to you. You can no longer expect anything from her. She choose to leave to be in a new relationship. She doesnt get to be apart of your life anymore. The fact that both of you are blocked from each other  is important to your healing. You will get better over more time. It starts with you realizing that she can not be the one you look to for healing and youre on the right path to that. Distract yourself with new activities that you wouldnt regularly do. Try new things and you might like it. Meet new people and put yourself  in a different circle. Let this breakup change you for the better. Looking back you can say i discovered  because  i was going through this breakup that i never otherwise would have found. It is a bumpy ride but the pain dulls over timeStay strongGood luck ,ExNoContact,db3es9p,2,t5_319jr

9970539,0,t1_db76aoy,She literally sent me a message of a picture of us with our dog all happy and shit. No words just the picture. I think they do this when they realize life isnt better bc they let us go. They thought life would improve with our absence and after weeks months years what have you they realize it wasnt us. What they probably fail to realize is that its internal. They arent happy with some aspect of their life and they immediately blame it on us their friends jobs family whatever but never evaluate themselves. So no matter what even if they have a new relationship the problems follow them. They need to work on them before anything else but unfortunately from my experience they rarely even think about how their actions are the source of their pain. I know that is a big part of what my ex is going through. She still has the same problems she had with me now the only difference is she is with someone who treats her far worse than I did and maybe she is finely realizing how loving and caring I was. But again this is my theory. It can also do with ego and the need for attentionvalidation. Either way its a powermind game. To win we need to use our own tactics and the best offense is defense no contact. ,ExNoContact,db76say,4,t5_319jr

10741315,0,t3_5toiuh,The withdrawals the lack of intimacy and the loneliness are normal and stay with you for a while its all a matter of adjustment. After a longterm relationship ends it does take a while for your brain to adjust to the new reality one that does not involve your former SO. The best thing to do as many others recommend as well is to fill your time with productive activities while taking the necessary time to heal and grieve.Staying busy wall to wall may seem like a good idea but in reality all it does is force the pain to lurk beneath the surface causing it to fester and mutate into something a lot more sinister. Therefore the first few weeksmonths are absolutely necessary in taking the time to grieve your loss understand why the relationship failed and your role in its demise. The analysis and rational thinking will help going forward because you will learn a lot about yourself and it gives you a chance to improve as person.As far as loneliness goes staying busy definitely helps as does focusing on goalsprojects. Many people start working out in order to lookfeel good others take up new hobbies such as music. Anything that makes you feel good overall is a wonderful way to combat the blues after a breakup. Rebuilding social connections also helps because friends and family can be a great source of comfort when combating depressive thoughts. You mention debt and I think it would be wise to set a goal for yourself to eliminate that and work towards financial independence. Try to find activities that you find fulfilling and spend your spare time indulging in them reading has become a huge source of comfort for me and Ive read over a dozen books in the last few months.gtI might not be able to find another girlfriend until AprilI think that you should focus on sorting your life out first get rid of the debt that you mention heal properly and most importantly  become happy with yourself before you even consider a relationship. Entering a relationship from a place of neediness is a recipe for disaster in my humble opinion. You can definitely find contentment and joy within yourself and then proceed to find someone special to share it with. An arbitrary deadline such as that is more harmful than beneficial and you are better off simply focusing on yourself for the next little while which is key after a relationship.All the best,ExNoContact,ddnvvyg,3,t5_319jr

10840838,0,t1_ddxtexb,You seem like a good caring person who struggles with boundaries. I struggle the same. People that are manipulative like this thrive on nice guys that dont have strong boundaries. They twist with your head. It might not be flat out consiously done as an evil intent but that is what makes people like this so difficult they arent even aware of the damage they cause but they are so good at doing it because they truly dont carry the introspection to realize it and start shutting it off. That is why they are toxnic. YOU are the good guy here...but you are allowing this woman to rule you and so you need to take responsibility for your boundaries and make it come to a stop.So to answer your question I would say yes at a certain point in a relationship it is valid to talk about the number of partners youve both had. Although once you both have been tested for STDs then I guess it doesnt really matter HOWEVER at this point with your ex no it is not your business anymore at all. Plus keep in mind dude she is a liar. She is going to tell you whatever she thinks will manipulate you in the way she currently wants to manipulate you.My ex did similar things. She would hang out with a friend and weeks later Id find out they used to be fuck buddies. It is a LIE. People that are honest in healthy relationships dont keep hanging out with FUCK BUDDIES a secret because they trust and love eachother. Your instincts are screaming at you left and right that something is not right about the Anthony thing because it is NOT RIGHT. That is so fucked up I would be livid. You absolutey deserve better treatment and I KNOW its so nice to get have sex with a hot girl and get attention from her and blah blah blah it is a toxic DRUG that you are now realizing you must go through the painful withdrawls.Be single for a while and look up how to establish strong boundaries. Learn to say NO. Check out No More Mr. Nice Guy. Its a great book on boundaries specifically for men. Wish you the best man dont contact this abuser any more!,ExNoContact,ddy5maw,2,t5_319jr
10848788,0,t3_5v33zt,Follow what others have said and it would prove greatly for your progression. Not having the means to sneak peek on their lives will cut off the supply for you to reminiscence the past and that urge will decrease naturally to you as time goes on. And remember when they post happy feeling ever so alive or the best time of their lives pictures on social media they are typically facades. When is being done in this fashion they are merely masking their emotions on the breakup because they dont know how to cope with the problem or correctly handle the situation. Take me for example. This past Valentines day my brotherinlaw invited me to the Poconos lodge for  days to celebrate my nieces birthday. We all went up there had a blast at the water park celebrated all day eat lavishly and had a great time overall. We had a GoPro recording going on most of the time and the times you see me Im all estatic and brimming with joy. But for the whole  days I was thinking about her and this swinging pendulum of sadness occupies me no matter what I did. Yet I know this is the correct step of recovery for myself as oppose to declining the offer and stay at home wallowing in regrets. I could have easily give up on the vacation because of my sprain ankle from the day before but I power on through!Its only been a about a month for me as well since the breakup and NC so we both have our paths still along ahead of us.

10936715,0,t1_de7w2tj,Ive been NC for quite a while now and have had many things happen to me since. Had a failed shortterm relationship was lead on for  months by another lady met many others who lead nowhere did a bit of travelling got back into hobbies younameit.What has consistently been a blessing though is thisgt My main piece of advice is do stuff for yourselfInvariably without fail everytime I felt depressed about myself or my current state of mind I took it upon me to find something fun to do alone on my own and by Thor has it been a relief.All those other people ultimately couldnt have brought me the happiness I found when not giving a fuck about anythinganyone and enjoying myself to bits doing whatever. It can be as silly as driving around town at am with the music blasting please avoid residential areas if you do this lol. Anything that you likeenjoy just do!I have reached a point at which Im very wary of letting someone else into my life. My whole environment and living space is dialed in how I like it and I dont want to risk it all up for someone who maybe cant be trusted.I think you know youre okay when you dont feel the loneliness anymore.

And I feel guilty like maybe there is something wrong with me for not having moved on already but the more I think of it I guess if I moved on quickly it would show that the love wasnt all that deep.

11114903,0,t1_dertjwr,Im very sorry you took it that way. My ex knows nothing about my life and nothing about what happened with her friend and I. It wasnt done to hurt or spite my ex. It was done because She and I are both single consenting adults and we made a conscious choice to do that together. My ex will never find out about it. Nor will I ever find out who my ex is sleeping with. Youre taking a vague story from me and filling in the gaps with the pain youre feeling from your experience. I dont really think thats fair. Because if you read my post history and knew my situation I think you would maybe understand where Im coming from. Im sorry for the pain youre going through. And while you most likely dont want anything from me if theres anything I can do to help please let me know. But I really dont need to defend my choices or my life to you.

11144071,0,t1_dev4ecj,I did the exact same thing rd day in I told them I loved them and finally replied to their breadcrumbs. They wanted to know why I didnt want to be their friend and I told her a long list of how bad I felt and how unloved and uncared for a felt. She seemed mad that I wrote such things and I said I generally put it across that Im willing to be friends if she can make a valued effort with me for a change and show me that she wants me in her life. This is the point where she stopped replying. I sent some more messages out of desperation and my final message without response was for her not to contact me and that Im deleting her number. I feel devastated and know exactly how you feel. Just being unwanted by the person you love hurts so much. But deep down I know they have very little concern for me they wouldnt want me to suffer this much it they cared. Id go as far as saying she enjoys doing this to me. Anyway I hope youre ok and know youre not alone. Im on day  again of NC and I dont want to do it either and depending on if and how she contacts me I dont know how or if Ill respond. Youre not alone.

11605113,0,t1_dgbfhzu,Youre welcome ltAnd yeah NC is really tough and I miss my ex so much too. Like I would give anything for things to work out and to be with them again. The thing is for it to work this time again they and I both need to be different people. We cant go back to our old relationship because it didnt work and we need to make a new one together if we ever both want for things to work out better the next time. So I am working on loving and taking care of myself and making myself a better person. I realize too at this point being the person who got dumped I need them to go out on a limb for me and ask for me back because I dont want to be with someone who actually doesnt really want to be with me or feels nothing less than deep love and respect for me. We deserve to be with people who will treasure us give us so much love and will do all they can to NOT hurt us. Its hard now and it fucking hurts and sucks to be broken up with but were fighting for something better and we are growing our own selfrespect to have the other person contact us to show if they do actually care about us.lt do what you need to do to to take care of yourself  like cry and vent and exercise and talk to friends and write out all you would want to tell them but dont send it to them and NC is the way to go to help you start to heal from this too,ExNoContact,dgbg6iu,3,t5_319jr
