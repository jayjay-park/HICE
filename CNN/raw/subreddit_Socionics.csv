10119118,0,t3_5krugs,Fe PoLR. Extremely noticeable in day to day group activities. Really opposed to group dynamics overly expressive displays and outbursts of emotion campaigns based on expression of social merit but do little to achieve tangible progress and conformists who join the wagon just for the sake of everyone getting along together. I defeinitely see its value and importance in society and when it bottlenecks me in social environments but i absolutely detest it. ,Socionics,dbqj1fu,5,t5_2tkky
10916390,0,t3_5uwp5z,Supervision and benefit are very important relations in your life. These relationships are needed for your to evolve as a person. Both contribute something positive to your life benefactors send an energy impulse that activates you and inspired you to socially realize yourself. Supervisors share valuable information and correct your own skewed thinking. Dont avoid these relations  youll majorly screw yourself over. The solution is not to cut yourself off from the rest of the society. Learn to keep appropriate distance and not get cranky every time they do or say something you dont like. Then these relationships will go much smoother.It is also true that not every benefactor amp supervisor is your type of person. Be picky who you associate with. If the friendship or relationship feels like a wreck from the very beginning then dont pursue it and certainly dont impose your company on them but look to other people.,Socionics,de5y5mt,1,t5_2tkky
