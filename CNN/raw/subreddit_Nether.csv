46948,0,t3_1ulo1x,The first few games I played I found myself in the same boat. But maybe luck or switching servers I find guns no problem. Move to higher populated servers and give it time. Itll kick in.,Nether,cejrxhh,1,t5_2y79w

525218,0,t3_204sna,its horrible the game play is cluncky as shit if warz had anything it was a smoother gameplay the hitbox is shit and so is the bullet delay basically you have to lead your shots almost  a few meters  a head of your enemy even if youre close range. ,Nether,cfzz1lh,-2,t5_2y79w

626837,0,t1_cg96j69,I would personally recommend that people do NOT do this as there is a long history of online game companies retroactively banning or otherwise severely punishing those who take advantage of exploits once the exploit has been patched.,Nether,cgbitgp,1,t5_2y79w

1291377,0,t1_cieuzs5,Okay but putting your neck out and scavenging for much longer with less gear means a higher chance of getting killed. Having a way to speed up your gear up process is a huge leg up over other players. Literally all you do in the game is loot and kill things. How can you not consider faster and better looting to be an advantage?,Nether,ciewa80,2,t5_2y79w
1291403,0,t1_cies5ya,The whole reason for Early access is to. Provide feedback to the developers. Invest your money into making the game betterquickerIf you didnt understand this when you bought the game its your fault not theirs,Nether,ciewe0t,2,t5_2y79w

1310055,0,t1_ciflxwj,I have had the game since around  months ago when you could first buy it. It isnt polished but it is very fun and playable. They never had it on sale for the  like they did the other day. Phosphor never expected to get this much of an influx of players this is why the servers are shit at the moment. They never had to upgrade server strength before now. I dont think it is right to bash a company because it couldnt have known its own success.,Nether,cigzxd7,0,t5_2y79w
1311003,1,t3_293kvi,Not bug feature. This way you pay more real money to the devs.,Nether,cih3rps,2,t5_2y79w

5322344,0,t1_cvi6aj1,That wasnt Phosphors call theyre literally a contractor Nether Productions basically an LLC formed by a venture group of some kind were typical corporate money hungry dipshits and released the game before it was ready leading to a lot of Phosphor devs qutting the project and the dev contract being transferred to PureFPS.What we should be judging Phosphor on was what they developed before they were removed which was a rough and rugged but very enjoyable prerelease title  for me those were easily the best times in Nether and it had a ton of potential.Id be a little hesitant to blame a contractor for the decisions of the titular owners.,Nether,cvrzpci,1,t5_2y79w

6074485,0,t1_cyf2ad4,read a lot of good reviews that apparently the old devs came back people praising them like they never abandoned the game. Game is still shit fucking steam reviews,Nether,cyfunqd,1,t5_2y79w
