422486,0,t3_1ywt4x,Amazon RDS for SQL Server is a nice solution.  The free version however wont let you do much besides storing data and running the database server.  Do you have a Windows server already running on premise?  If its not under heavy load it might be worth it to just throw SQL Server Express on it since it doesnt sound like you need a highly transactional server.  The downside is that you cant rely on Amazon for things like backups and security.If you do go with Amazon RDS read the docs.  Theres quite a few gotchas that dont work.  The nice thing about RDS is that it scales very well.My suggestion is to make API calls and ETL that data into the RDS SQL Server instance.  Then create scripts to automate the Excel file creation and have it available on a local fileshare.,Database,cfok0rf,1,t5_2qian

516117,0,t3_1zrs80,I think this is a valid concern. As a DBA myself I do worry about longevity. I typically find that plenty of places can get by without an form of DB specialist but quite often if requirements grow beyond a certain size then a DBA either becomes a requirement or at the very least a contract DBA becomes a requirement. With respect to NoSQL I think the wheels are starting to come off that movement already the current solutions arent being the performance panacea that some expect NoSQL has its niches but theyre so niche that I personally struggle to come up with many reasonable use cases. Im certain that they will continue to gain market share though as their suitability or rapid prototyping is undeniable from a developers perspective though I dont think the market share will be very damaging to the RDBMS world in the shortmedium term. As others have stated RDBMS are firmly entrenched in IT and that aint gonna turn around overnight RDBMS are here for a good few decades more yet. I think the landscape could also change a little towards the cloud but again Im not personally expecting any great movement there I think that having such a hard dependency on an external supplier is not something that certain companies would want to commit to I think that some companies may not be comfortable committing to the cloud either from a security perspective. I have to say though that a DBA career path can be a difficult path and I do foresee it as a shrinking niche in part due to other database types e.g. MongoDB  Hadoop but also because as the supporting tools become easier to use and more comprehensive and also because of The Cloud.Regarding the cloud Ive seen some demo videos of MS Azure and I have to say its a very very attractive proposition. All that being said I think DBAs are here to stay but the role will change over time and perhaps job competition may heat up a little.,Database,cfyxpe0,2,t5_2qian

2084265,0,t1_cl428uy,Not necessarily true  theres pretty much zero reason to ever do math on an ID but it makes a lot more sense to store an ID as an int rather than a string. Not to mention that storing something as a number automatically constrains it to be a number  if its a string suddenly alphanumeric inserts are possible so you need to ensure that data integrity is checked for elsewhere in the stack. For me the question should be are leading zeros possible and if so if they are truncated will they screw up a join? Additionally do the values by definition conform to an existing numeric type int dec etc and if so can that ever change? If yes to any of those then string if not then numeric. That being said as has already been pointed out SSN should always be encrypted.,Database,cl4r7w4,0,t5_2qian

4031881,0,t3_36oftm,Some questions you should ask  What are the use cases for the application data entry reporting stock management etc  How many operations estimate will each type of use of the application generate?  What is the intended usage pattern for the application How many times per day will each user or group of users be in the application.   Is the usage pattern for any particular thing likely to be bunched up? eg end of month reporting or monday morning recieving From all of these things you can estimate how many people are likely to be hitting the application all at once. Build in some good buffers because its better to be pessimistic than optimistic on these things. Now go figure out if you can find examples of anyone else having this many people in Filemaker all at once. Are there issues with concurrent access? Do they need to do anything special to make it work?Other things to consider Can they integrate Filemaker with other database systems they might want eg reporting systems or websitesales systems. Also consider the cost of licences  if they need a seat or user licence how many people will that be? What about backups  do you have to do anything special i.e cut off access to do backups or can you do online backups safely? Also if your Filemaker developer gets hit by a bus takes a holiday gets fired walks out the door... whatever  do they have anyone else who can take it over or learn it  or will they be stuck trying to hire someone else?

Which it absolutely is.gts there a way to centralize the DB access method such that it is not required?In a Windows environment with SQL Server youd have everyone use their Windows credentials AD account for authentication everywhere and put your developers into a common AD group. Then grant that group the appropriate permissions in the dev environment to make their changes. Now you have no sharing of credentials and no mismatched passwords because AD is pervasive. Even better when a new developer comes on you just add him to the appropriate groups and he automatically has all the access he needs instead of managing access to a dozen systems separately.Can you do something similar with your environment perhaps via LDAP?Or you could go one step further and give no developers direct access to the database instead managing schema changes via scripts executed by a CI tool. Developers check in their changes the CI tool picks up the changes amp executes them against the database. One such example google ci for databases for more.,Database,culphzv,3,t5_2qian

Its more of a marketing page right now and really the only marketing weve got. Were just crazy busy trying to build the db that updating the website is secondary.gt both keys and values are byte strings not unicode. What does the not unicode mean? Does this mean I cant hold unicode or is this a byte array and doesnt care?Its just a byte array.  But this is an internal implementation detail.  When it comes to interacting with the DB youll use SQL and this wont matter at all.gt When using the Raft consensus algorithm is there a coordinator node or are all nodes equal? If there is a coordinator is it via election process? Can Raft clusters I guess? get splitbrain?Part of Raft is the election of a leader. This ensure theres no split brain since you always require at least a quorum to elect a leader.  If you lose the quorum than the data becomes unavailable until its restored.  Give it a read its a very straightforward algorithm.gt I understand timing is going to be important here and read about the HLC which answered a lot of the timing questions I had but does the HLC still rely on NTP andor Hardware clock seems like it must somewhere? If yes what happens if the nodes are not in sync?The hardware clocks are indeed used.  But as long as the clock skew is less than the max clock skew setting this wont be a problem.  Raft actually ensures all the nodes are in sync so if one falls behind it will need to catch up and it will know its behind right away.gt I see there is a SQL api unspecified you said you are working on can you elaborate on that part any?

Maybe the owner just likes planes and hawkers is his personal website and was going to use the information for something at some point. There is really nothing noteworthy about any of it.At its simplest a basic website is literally just a folder on a server somewhere that is publically accessible. The only difference with hawkers.com is that the owner has not turned off directory listing and does not have an index page set up correctly so instead of seeing a website you are instead seeing the folder that contains some of the files for the website.,Database,de4l1pc,3,t5_2qian
