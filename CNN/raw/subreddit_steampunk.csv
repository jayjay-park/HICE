113555,0,t1_cer1u9a,I dont believe that Steampunk as a modern cultural body has its origins in steampunk literature at least not directly. Its far too visual and informed by visuals. I would bet my left arm that the number of people whove seen Disneys  Leagues Under the Sea far outweigh the number whove read Vernes book.With visual sources of information in mind think of how much steampunk imagery weve been exposed to since the s...there were quite a few films of Victorians with advanced technology from the s into the s...like The Time Machine and Master of the World. Doctor Who was an old man in a frock coat running around history in a time machine sometimes with Victorianera companions. That was . Wild Wild West premiered in  with Robert Conrad hiding sophisticated gadgets in his overly tight pants.By the time Ronald Clark and Michael Moorcock were exploring the concept in the late s it had already been germinating for over a decade. The s just saw more of it with Tom Baker finding a woodandbrass console room of the Tardis and movies like Time After Time with its brass submarinelike time machine. By the time the term was coined there were entire swaths of the collective unconscious that had been informed for their entire lives of the concept of Victorians with advanced technology. Time Bandits had characters that were costumed in a pastiche from all eras. I would suggest that we modern steampunks have been receiving enough visual information that its fairly easy for individuals to approach the concept independently without having read any steampunk literature. ,steampunk,cerczse,1,t5_2qhz8

1497130,0,t3_2b93wi,Ok first off dont take my criticism negatively. I have done a lot of reenacting in my time and that is the view I am coming from. . Choose a personae. You have not done that. You have a mishmash of ideas going but you dont choose one. Are you a cowboy? An engineer? A scientist? A banker? What are you? . Put together a very good base outfit around that personae. Since you chose the American West that should be easy to put together a base outfit that can function for a lot of different characters.  If you cant afford to buy a full outfit right off I suggest either buying a piece at a time or buy patterns to make your own. The details will always make or break your outfit. In your case they are breaking it. Something as seeming unimportant as the shoes you wear will get you every time. Get rid of the jungle boots. If you want a pants tucked look without a lot of money I suggest a military lowquater from a thrift store matched with a gaiter. Here is a site that shows you how to make your own that are period correct. The belt. Get rid of it. Mens belts in the th Century were about  inches wide. I know belts can be expensive. All leather gear is. ,steampunk,cj3xulx,2,t5_2qhz8

1917702,0,t3_2ghdur, It had been about a decade but it felt much longer than that at the time. The devastating effects of the Calamity were still very apparent. Thats what we had called it the Calamity but I was certain there were other names for it elsewhere. I think Ive heard it referred to as the Apocalypse but that seemed too dramatic. There are obviously still humans running around so Apocalypse didnt seem appropriate. Neither was Rapture appropriate because there was nothing supernatural about it. That and no one was saved. In any case it had been a decade since then and there was still too much glass in the air to breathe. Everyone had to wear a set of goggles and breather mask while outside or else the glass dust gets into your lungs or eyes. Everywhere inside was protected by air locks and filters. Venturing beyond your front door was quite a process so no one left their homes without good reason. One of those reasons was pirate attacks. With the seas becoming more difficult to travel pirates had taken to reconstructing their ships to fly instead. Sky pirates we called them. Sails were replaced by leather balloons filled with light gasses like hydrogen and helium. Oars were replaced with long sticks to push the ships away from buildings. Engines were added to lift and propel the airships. The pirates themselves were scoundrels but there was something adventurous and romantic about them. At least from my perspective there was. I knew my father wouldnt approve so I kept my fancies a secret. The truth was that sky pirates seemed exciting and I was terribly bored. There were very few young people around what with people not wanting to bring children into this world rife with doom and danger where even stepping outside was a risk. Still I wanted to see the world or what it had become in the past ten years. What seventeenyearold wouldnt be curious?There. I have a reason for goggles a reason for weapons and prosthetics and some more details for some flavour. It kind of got away from me though. What do you think?,steampunk,ckk9qck,2,t5_2qhz8

Im hoping to pick up some techniques that we can use to up our game.Id love if this show focused a little more on buildingteaching and less on a competition.  But that would probably have to be its own thing and with so many youtube tutorials and channels I dont know that there would be a studio market for it.,steampunk,d8z4jih,2,t5_2qhz8

10350314,0,t3_5o2wcg,Wow OP just gets worse and worse. They took an interview with Thomas Willeford from the steampunk research and development podcast downloaded the podcast then uploaded it to their own soundcloud channel giving ZERO credit to the podcast in any way. And yes I listened to the beginning of OPs soundcloud file to make sure it is really the exact same stolen podcast.Heres the episode at the top of this list and stolen and uploaded to OPs own soundcloud account ,steampunk,dch9nx0,3,t5_2qhz8

10606303,0,t1_dd2chxq,Im fascinated by what drives steampunk in a literal sense. What I mean is obviously technology is more advanced in a steampunk world that it actually was in Victorian England but what is the source of the difference? Some universes have magic as the difference some have aetheric technology others dont have any new energy source but just show steam and gears doing things unrealistic such as giant robot spiders. You need something though I think.,steampunk,dd9yj6t,1,t5_2qhz8
