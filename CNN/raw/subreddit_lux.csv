7483251,0,t1_d2spdju,Lack of other options mostly. Its still  AP and some HP though you shouldnt really need defensive stats post lane in most cases as Lux if youre smart. You never got Rylais before because Zhonyas was just a better item even though neither items activepassive is used very often on Lux. With Zhonyas being shifted into a situational item and losing  AP it should only be bought when absolutely necessary on Lux Zed Knife Kitty Talnne etc. Ideally youd rather have a stacked Mejai in that slot but that doesnt always happen. It may be worth exploring GLP as a last item since it gives mana and the active wouldnt be horrible on Lux. Overall I think shes suffered from this update though at least late game because she just doesnt have many desirable items. ,lux,d2ssyib,1,t5_2rmkl

9754609,0,t1_daffwte,You dont have enough AP either. Both of them arent great second item choices thats why most people myself included buy Ludens. But if I had to choose it would be Void Staff. Even against a champion who has  MR Void will be still greatWith Sorcerers and Void you brind down his MR to . Almost true damage.,lux,dafh2rz,1,t5_2rmkl
9765158,0,t1_dagq417,Totally agree! Basically Thunderlord is for burstcombo based champions like Lux oh really? She benefits a lot with the early high damage of the keystone increasing your kill potential a lot. Great synergy with Ludens passive. Makes your laning phase easier before and after level .Deathfire is more efficient on DoTHigh scaling champions like Swain Jhin Jhins passive makes people cry with Deathfire.,lux,dagrtwx,1,t5_2rmkl

10118325,0,t3_5kt1xq,Honestly i think the black bars on topbottom are a bit too big to the point where you actually miss stuff on the screen because of it like on a lot of clips there you could barely see your targets you should greatly reduce their thicknesssize.,lux,dbqfbos,1,t5_2rmkl

10278948,0,t3_5lxnqp,Using E to zone an enemy into a narrow space is great for landing easy bindings and the slow from your E helps too. For example if the enemy mid laner is standing near the side of their minion wave putting an E slightly behind them and delaying the detonation will usually get them to run to the leftright depending on which side theyre on getting them out of the way of their minions and opening them up for an easy Q. Lucent Singularitys slow lasts for a tiny bit of time after they leave the area too so you can take advantage of that if youre quick!,lux,dc96b8l,1,t5_2rmkl

10834114,0,t1_ddx8vk4,Yes but I would argue that exhaust is taken more when you are worried about assassins like zed or talon jumping on you and oneshotting you after lane phase. Ignite could help you get the kill on them but ultimately just making sure you stay alive will allow you to get more damage off.  I think of ignite as a spell to be used when you are trying to go in on someone or running them down which lux isnt really suited for.,lux,ddxgntz,1,t5_2rmkl

11239020,0,t1_df1ulk5,I think Luxs shield is intended to be mediocre as it can target a whole team.. TWICE.I kinda agree with the MS but not that much as I think its an intended weakness for a champ that has deals decent amount of burst and CC.I dunno I am very confident with my Lux game.. I mean i got  percent winrate on Lux at Plat with k mastery.. like playing lux is almost if not instinctive to me.  so probably it all boils down on how familiar you are at the champ..I also build her as a glasscannon almost no defense items whatsoever. Maybe this would be because of familiarity of her weaknesses over time that i am able to deal with the MS and shield issue..But yeah please no buffs on damages.. I dont want to see my main Irelianerfed because of it later..I mean buffs are a NICEtohave on lux minus the threat of being nerfed but not a NEEDtohave IMO.,lux,df5xdad,1,t5_2rmkl

XDPlatin is nothing special so dont be rude to people who are not on your level LMAOAnd btw his statement is true Lux is a sniper and her job is to burst a squishy target down from range not to fight v DPS like a Cassio or Ryze would do. You cant compare apples with oranges these are completely different champions with a different kit and Lux simply got the bigger range so DPS really doesnt matter in this case. ,lux,dfdg0f3,1,t5_2rmkl

11659345,0,t1_dggqgc6,I like the blind idea too allows for some unique counter play. Ive always liked the idea of Luxs kit having more to do with vision. Allowing more of her abilities to grant vision or blinding enemies. Like a small aoe blind when she ults would fit thematically into her kit or perhaps a blind around her when her shield returns.,lux,dghlnuw,1,t5_2rmkl
