880530,0,t3_247f67,Is this serious? Mozs vinyl dude that owns the shop has a heart attack and the next of kin sells all the stuff without giving the customers their stuff. Then Moz has a fire and all his stuff is ruined? But wait it gets better he uses his friends accounts on paypal.gt My first reaction to this whole fire thing and the GB was to refund everyones money but that is a little tricky with my PayPal setup. I can accept money not send since it is not linked to any CC which is required for PP India. I use my friends accounts to pay for stuff when I need to. All funds in PP are autowithdrawn to attached bank account every morning. So refund is a very long process involving several more bankPayPalForEx charges.I can smell the burning bullshit from here.,Ripster,ch4dbbr,3,t5_2uh0a
