42437,0,t3_1uf6ky,My first kayak was still is a Wilderness Systems Pamlico tThe first major outing I didnt have the rudder system and it was frustrating.  The next time I installed the  rudder kit and practically broke the sound barrier slight exaggeration.  Sure its about  lbs. but it is durable as hell and stable enough to fight that  pound pike without breaking a sweat.  Also Im a fan of the seats that come with it... plenty of nice adjustments.The only problem is that they discontinued the  ft. model.  You can still get the . ft. and the . ft. modelsWhatever you end up choosing... I highly recommend you get one with a rudder.,Kayaking,cej9gl0,1,t5_2rbz0

94722,0,t1_cep5pk4,Well I had a wall of text response to this but somehow I fat fingered it and blew it away  so Ill skip right to the TLDR version.Paddle cadence does tend to be faster with the GP  but the power is there when you need it for turns or rolls by extending the blade to the needed side slide the paddle out.  The skinny blades fit in your hand so you can use the whole paddle.  Advantages of the GP easy on your joints efficient great in wind great for rolling fun to make and tinker with versatile cheap quiet.  Disadvantages wet paddling no drip rings fragile unless protected with FG or epoxy not great for quick high power moves needed in surfing or white water.A couple of sites for you  gives a nice summary of some GP advantages.   is the home of Qajaq USA a group that supports traditional paddling using the GP.,Kayaking,cep7q1e,1,t5_2rbz0

828575,0,t1_cgwa2tk,I have a Jeep and it makes a significant difference. It would be noticeable if they were permanently was my point. If he is just getting into kayaking a kayak like the Pelican  is all you ever need especially this years models. I have  of them. Are they fast? No. But I love the fact that they are replaceable for under  if they were to be stolen. I dont feel bad if I leave them out where they could get stolen yard dock car etc. Being inexpensive I dont feel bad modifying them. I added a bunch of rigging to mine and didnt care drilling holes in the top and bolting on U bolts to run rigging. I have a rod holder that I bolt on for while Im fishing and take off when Im not. I have clip on drink holders too. Also its a kayak that floats. Im a bigger guy  lbs and I have no problem even when its fully loaded. Last summer I used a Pelican  to kayak the MR  miles from Kansas City to St. Louis on the Missouri River. My Pelican and I made it. I would have liked a longer boat but I didnt need it. I was able to bring all the gear I needed for a week long trip we did it in  days. I put in a  mile day on that boat and I was fine at the end of it. There are rapids here that I kayak too. Generic kayak skirts fit the Pelican nicely and again Im fine taking big rapids without worrying about damaging a  dollar kayak. Ive had mine for  years and am just now seeing some wear through on the bottom and Ive pretty much beat it up. At the end of the day all you need out of a kayak is it to float and hold your gear. If I were to buy one that I was permanently leaving on my car thatd be the boat Id buy. ,Kayaking,cgyglh3,1,t5_2rbz0

979603,0,t3_25bfzo,You need to treat the great lakes like you would an ocean body. Gordon Lightfoot didnt write a song about Gitchigoomi for nothing. River currents and undertow in the St Clair and Detroit Rivers has killed people who fall in. These are BIG lakes with BIG weather and surf. Im not saying this to be scary and a downer I paddle the St Clair and Lake Huron all summer. Going with the current isnt that much work you will be able to go far People day tour the st clair all the time. But i would be extremely hesitant of taking on such an ambitious open water trip on that in a  boat with a self described experience level of nonexistent. Maybe before you do this you should practice playing in the surf on a rougher day or doing a day float down one of the major rivers like i mentioned earlier. ,Kayaking,chfn0zl,3,t5_2rbz0
1033981,0,t1_chlscfa,Hey!In general Minnehaha is a great creek for all types of paddlers.  However this part th and Franceish is usually a portage easy takeout and putin for most canoers and kayakers most times of the year. The creek is VERY high right now so it is quite fast.  Since you havent done much flowing water I would just advise you to wait until the levels drop a bit before you go.  We saw many novices out yesterday and most fared well although a couple canoes went in the drink because they couldnt maneuver the fast currents in certain spots.You can check out the levelsgauges here  and Since you havent done it before I would advise waiting until the flows are under cfs.

There was a stretch after Saltholmen Light House until the rivercanal system leading up to Lillesand.At that stretch we had about meter tall waves which challenged my comfort level but always being spotted by an experience paddler made me feel safe and able to handle the new experience.The members of Lillesand Paddle Club who organized the trip and the other experienced paddlers who participated were fantastic at making me and my girlfriend welcome and taken care of throughout the four day paddle.The paddler Lars Verket has written a campsite book about the area. Lots of good spots in his book and books on campsites in Norway. We slept at Merden Valyene and at a small island in a lake up Reddals canal until we finally had last camp at Skauerya.Midday lunch breaks were taken at various places such as Grimstad and Saltholmen Lighthouse. Im afraid I cant recall the two other places right now.Once again there were some fantastic people who we paddled with.

If you still feel the need to take them with you put them in your PFD so that if you become separated from your boat you will still have your keys.IMO better to leave them with your car that way if something happens to you on the water somebody can still access your car in an emergency.

4732446,0,t1_ctqvs9v,I scaled the plans up and chopped the ends off for a plumb bow and stern I also widened the plans slightly and added more arch to the side panels to retain the angle of the sides at the cockpit. I tweaked quite a bit in Inventor until it looked right and then unfolded the panels and printed a full scale template. Somewhere I screwed up because it didnt go together quite right not enough arch in the sides is my guess and I ended up cutting some relief into the bottom panels to remove a wrinkle in the panels. As a result Ive ended up using a ton of thickened epoxy to fair the hull and even still its not great. Tied to my kids boat it wont matter which is the only reason I didnt go back and start over. Also the cockpit opening is huge because Im a lot fatter than I was  years ago when I last had a kayak of my own.,Kayaking,ctr2eyd,1,t5_2rbz0

4844380,0,t3_3h87hw,I cant answer everything but my immediate response to the quesiton in the title was Kayak tomorrow too!The rec kayak will be a bit slow because its not designed for speed. It will however probably be very maneuverable in a place like a marsh.I havent owned any sitontops but I have paddled them after coming from my plastic notamazing sea kayak they usually feel a little like riding a mountain bike with knobby fat tires on dirt roads after riding a racing bike on a paved street. Theyre wider and they push more waterbut I realize this is a generalization and there are some amazing SOTs that come close to being as fast as anything sitin.Type of paddle google paddle length and such. My recommendation is to get the lightestweight paddle you can afford this will impact your experience on long trips more than the boat. it might need to be longer than Im used to for a SOT but keep in mind that some kayakers dont believe that being tall should mean that you should have a longer paddle others do believe that because your handsarms end up the same distance from the water anyway. If there is any way you can try multiple paddles in the boat of your choice or similar that would be superhelpful. Try them for a few hours at a time. Paddles make a huge difference.Superlightweight paddles are all carbon fiber and whatnot and usually . The more common ones are fiberglass. Despite prevailing opinions Im convinced my Bending Branches wood paddle is as light as some fiberglass paddles but many wood paddles are heavy. And anything thats not made by a major serious manufacturer is likely to just suck and weigh like a brick from personal experience. For touring Werner is a really common brand with a lot of good offerings.Car Ive fit two largewideish kayaks deckdown on top of my old Geo Prizm think Corolla with raingutterattached aftermarket roof racks. Not a problem the racks just have to be wide enough. I think i could probably fit three if I were to have a stacker system and stack them on edge. Yakima Thule etc. sell expensive options.Buying a kayak no idea where you live but try paddlers.net and craigslist good kayaks are like good bikes and good guitars in at least two ways first people who own them regularly trade up for nicer models and then sell what they have. Second if theyre good quality they have a nice long life expectation often spanning multiple owners. So my recommendation is to check craigslist and any other classifieds you can find you could end up getting something great for a sweet deal. Of course YMMV but at the end of the season I think people are more interested in selling their personal stuff than at the beginning.No idea about buying new except that this past year somewhere I saw an article in which somebody was of the opinion that there isnt a very big price fluctuation by season in nice kayaks. But no source so take that with a grain of salt.Good luck and happy kayaking! Dont let anyone suggest youre doing it wrong unless theyre talking about your technique!,Kayaking,cu565eg,2,t5_2rbz0

4890020,0,t3_3hvk1f,Full album linkThe NYC Water Trail launch map from ParksRec is out of date and the launch that I remember from the last time I was down in Gowanus was blocked off by construction for a residential development.  As a result we ended up lowering the kayak with some ropes into the canal at the foot of Bond St and from there kayaked south on the canal.  We went out and paddled over to the Red Hook Grain Terminal then around Red Hook to Valentino Park to get some food.  From there we went out to Governors Island where the kayak dock apparently was washed away in a storm.  There is a usable dock that while blocked off is suitable and we were waved on by one of the workers there.  We waited out some thunder on the island then returned and did a straight shot to the canal from the other side of the island.   In the canal tide was out reducing the water quality further and making our original entry a little less viable.  Instead we paddled over to the foot of Second Ave which the Gowanus Dredgers had been using as their makeshift launch and actually ran across a pair of canoes launching at the time. The Upper Bay definitely gets choppy particulary because of frequent wakes from ferries and other vessels but that only resulted in getting soaked no risk to boat stability.   The Gowanus Canal was very still and mostly covered with a thin slick of oil.  The water was full of garbage and sometimes bubbled.  Overall a very good trip and a different perspective on the canal. ,Kayaking,cuaxcbe,2,t5_2rbz0

If it is  km your life will be easier if you think in terms of NM so its  nautical miles. At  knots thats  days doing a conservative  miles per day with no rest days On open water you can do more than  mile days easily. But I think most of the time you wont have open water.

7327925,0,t3_4fqjaz,This is a whitewater boat and designed specifically for doing whitewater. If you want to do whitewater anywhere from Class I up to Class V this is a good boat. Its definitely beginner friendly. Lots of people learn how to paddle whitewater in this boat and its capable of progressing with you as your skills develop.For flatwater and lazy rivers you will not like it. It does not track straight it isnt designed to and will constantly spin out on you.At your height and weight that is a good boat size. You could even maybe even get away with a Remix .A boat like that used typically goes for  online and they are now  new plus shipping.When looking for buying new you want to check the outfitting and see if its all there and working correctly check for any cracks or welds in the hull check for any pitons dents in the bow and stern check for any oil canning dents on the bottom of the hull check for any super deep gouges on the bottom it will have lots of scratches those are normal and check for any missing hardware drain plug foam grab loops etc.. If it has any of those the value of the boat drops a bit so I would ask for cash in the trade as well you might want cash anyway since canoes are usually worth a lot more than kayaks. Also if he throw in any extra gear like skirt helmet paddle float bags PFD the value goes up a bit.,Kayaking,d2b4vma,4,t5_2rbz0

I know many that own all the bells and whistles and have never used any of them. That dont know how to self rescue and almost never practice even wet exiting. At least they have clothing thatll help them hang out in the cold water until a rescue comes. My usual paddling group consists of different level instructors and we always take time to test and try every safety piece we have. We often do it in unexpected conditions to practice rescues on each other roll in cold water and try to keep ourselves on our toes and not too comfortable. You never know when youll have to run a scenario for real and the more you do it it becomes second nature. Were usually on the lookout in case we should assist someone on the water but when I see someone go out after we get back thats way underprepared for conditions we just experienced I always leave with a weird feeling  should I have mentioned anything?

7666700,0,t3_4kbdnm,Heya First of all actually you really can internet a lot.  Think about how much you learn from textbooks even without an instructor right ?  Of course Im not saying dont keep trying to get lessons and its awesome that you want them but Im saying dont be discouraged because theres actually a lot of the basics you can learn via multimedia.  Theres also several really good books on sea kayaking ... sea kayaking.  Will it all apply to a sit on top ? Nah of course not  you probably dont have the ability to edge lean roll exits are pretty easy etc.  But I betcha a lot of the water safety is pretty similar and in terms of understanding water currents and obstacles thats probably going to be the same. To find actually classes  which I highly recommend  google up the American Canoe Association or the British Canoe Association to find instructors who took their certification courses  they have locators and online referrals that can help you out.  Of course being in the middle of Georgia I wouldnt expect to find a plethora of them unless you happen to have whitewater nearby but who knows maybe sometime the two of you take a holiday weekend to the shore for classes. Also check out Meetup and google around for any local paddling clubs.  Theyre great resources ... when I first started kayaking I learned so much from those guys that when I recently took an ACA class they were surprised at how good I already was.  I admire that you want to take lessons.  Keep doing that  the desire to learn is gift. ,Kayaking,d3dnrmu,2,t5_2rbz0
7685314,0,t1_d3fckey,When you start getting into high end membranes it starts becoming a bit of a religious battle.  People forget or dont know that even the best membranes rely on certain climatic conditions and exertion to create the differential needed for the sweat vapor molecules to pass through to the outside and then even when a superior material comes along eVent then people question whether it allows too much to pass out    What I do know about Gore however is that like many high tech textile companies now think Cuban material they dont sell the material per se they more license its use and have rigid and high manufacturing process requirements.  This serves them in many ways of course and creates a brand out of their material but also lets them warrant the material... so basically you cant go wrong with Goretex although it may not be the best decision.  Ive seen arguments that HHs membrane material is superior Ive seen empirical but limited evidence that eVent is superior but of course theres a lot more to a jacket coat or pants than strictly how well it passes vapor in a lab test.

7768415,0,t1_d3n0g88,Just google Sit On Top Kayaks for plenty of pricing examples.   Dont forget to check your local Craigslist as well  many kayaks have quite a long lifespan and buying secondhand is rarely a problem. In terms of storage ideally you would want to store them indoors to keep them away from UV but reality is all  of my kayaks have been stored outdoors for  years and theyre fine.  Not even significant color fading and theres UV protectant you can apply if youre really worried about that.  I have more damage from saltwater corroding the adjuster buckle on my back strap than I do from being stored outside.   It can be useful to get a cockpit cover just to help keep little things blowing leaves little  legged things arachnids etc out.  You can google those as well and Harmony is a popular site for rd party kayaking accessories.   If you store it upside down you wont have to worry about rain in the cockpit and if you can store it elevated like on logs or stands thats probably even better.  Mine were stored on a homebuilt trailer that kept them off the ground but there was still plenty of slugs spider eggs etc in some of them that had been unused for literally years and years and years and I just power washed it all outoff good as new. For travel theres many options.  Back in the day people would just throw a towel or blanket over the hood over their car through a couple straps over the yak and through the car windows and drive nice and slow   These days theres a LOT more people on the road and you would probably be better served by some equipment but seriously dont be afraid to dirtbag it if you can do it safely ... theres a lot of equipment in the outdoor rec world thats awfully nice and convenient but not necessarily absolutely required and it all adds up in cost ! .  the cheapest gear route would be special made foam blocks that are curved on the top for the hull of the kayak but flat on the bottom for the roof of the car and then have channels through them for straps or for placing on a car rack.  the most expensive route would be rd party rack systems like Monroe Yakima or Thule with all sorts of fancy rollers gaspiston powered lifters seriously and everything in between.   ,Kayaking,d3p7gb8,1,t5_2rbz0

7898114,0,t1_d43qw8x,So that is a no? You are not a paddler and not really trying to contribute to the rkayaking community past improving the pelican brand name?gtSince we have a more efficient manufacturing process we are able to pass along the savings to the consumer. Ive heard you say this several times but it is marketing speak. There is a reason you can pickup a pelican for under  and it isnt because it is some highend kayak. Realistically that is all the market would bear for a product like this. If your prices were the same as real kayak brands like those offered by ConfluenceJohnson Outdoors or Ocean Kayaks like NDK Current Designs etc people wouldnt pay for it.Your along with Sun Dolphins value is the low costlow barrier to entry not the quality of your boat.While it may be possible from a technical standpoint that the layer system you use results in strong plastic the fact that it is two pieces negates much of this benefit. I would challenge you to find a professional paddler that would without you paying them concede that PelicanSun Dolphin kayaks are quality boats or anything more than cheap intro boats. gtPelican doesnt sell any products to the general public. All of our items are sold through retailers and distributors so were never trying to directly sell anything on here. The distinction between indirect and direct sales is negligible here and not something to be trumpeted.

Take it out on choppy water and the entire boat conforms to the shape of the waves... When you hit stuff the boat tends to deform rather than puncture.Ive hit all kinds of stuff with mine to no ill effect other than deglossing the bottom a little bit. You would need something hard and quite sharp to actually puncture the boat. Weather and water worn river rocks arent going to do it. A piece of flint or shale might. Ive run over plenty of branches and roots too and no punctures so far. Once theyve been sitting in the water most tree parts are good and soft. It does make a very silly noise if you hit something though.My main concern with shallow waters is how low your butt sinks when youre sitting in that thing.

8931030,0,t3_52lm3m,Disclaimer My longest trek sea kayaking was a week long trip down the Texas Gulf Coast I stick to lakes since I dont live near the ocean anymore. That said that is an awesome dream but damn just thinking about it makes me tired lol. Depending on how big you are scour craigslist for a used  sea kayak material isnt totally important but fiberglass andor kevlar are lighter and glide a bit better than plastic. Unless you have many many hours in the seat you will want a ton of practice and training with the boat before setting out.How are your rolling skills? A standard C to C roll from whitewater would technically suffice but there are other rolls which lend themselves better to certain conditions on the ocean backdeck and storm rolls etcHonestly if youre serious about this dream there are sea kayak instructorsschools in the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes that would be able to help you out much more than an online forum. Get a kayak practice the basics around home go take some sea kayaking classes and then go back home and hone those skills.Lastly consider learning to use a Greenland style paddle. I can vouch they are definitely easier on the shoulders for long distances and the buoyancy of wood paddles aids in many types of rolls.,Kayaking,d7ldmc6,2,t5_2rbz0

9583085,0,t3_5c7e4e,Make sure youre visible hiviz uppers and have signaling capability.  Might not be a bad idea to carry an air horn in addition to a whistle.  I have kayaked on reservoirs in AZ with tons of powerboat traffic the wake is a bigger issue than the boats themselves they dont slow down at all when going by.,Kayaking,d9ub71o,3,t5_2rbz0
9586339,0,t3_5c7e4e,For kayaking in the intracoastals amp canals in South Florida  take note of the type of boat traffic before heading out.  Unfortunately during the winter season and during holidays we have a lot of new and or drunk boat drivershelmsmenpilots that really shouldnt be in control of a boatyacht.  Be careful at intersections  a few close calls with head ons with waverunners and boats that dont understand what no wake zone means...  Avoid major waterways and canals on the weekend if possible ie. Las Olas.Stay off to the side and be aware of your surroundings.  Be sure you know how to do a solo and team reentry into your kayak should you capsize.  A bright colored PFD Hat and to some extent boat and paddle will increase your visibility.  If you think there is a possibility that your kayaking may extend to dusk  have your indicator lights on your kayak ready.,Kayaking,d9upn4y,2,t5_2rbz0

9774421,0,t1_dah4sul,Yes they both have skirts and there are stock adjustable braces in both of them. I made the skirts custom because buying one is like half the cost of those boats. Its not to hard with a good sewing machineok I admit gramdma did help me and they are not as nice or long lasting as the ones I can buy but it keeps the water out and as a bonus I made cockpit covers with the extra material. I was actually thinking of padding the pelican with a cut up pool noodle because it digs into your thighs were the dolphin actually has some padding but got a new boat so I never paddle in it now LOL. I was wondering why you thought they couldnt be rolled yeah it would be impossible with nothing to put my feet on but I think with no skirt I could get them over but Id have to get the water out after,Kayaking,dahwwjg,1,t5_2rbz0

Ive yet to take it surfing as Im redoing the gelcoat on the whole boat hard to see but shes busted up pretty bad but I did get in one rock gardening day and honest to god its the best sea kayak Ive ever paddled in those conditions. my buddy in a reflection didnt even do as well  probably more due to the fact he didnt want to scratch up his boat,Kayaking,db5g3yi,1,t5_2rbz0

There is some variation depending on if I am going on the river or ocean.For instance I dont bring the radio or the tow belt on the river and if I do bring the throw bag with me on the ocean it stays in the drybag instead of in the boat like it would on the river.
