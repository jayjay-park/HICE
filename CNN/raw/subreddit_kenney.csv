8496713,0,t3_4w0oth,Hey Kenney!Been using your assets for a while now. I used to work for LumiKids you can look em up here if you care for it   While we had dedicated artists for final projects I cant tell you how many prototypes featured your work. Really solid consistent stuff. Keep at it.As far as this pack goes I have one immediate piece of feedback. By comparison the row boat and red barge feel very empty and boring. The rest of the ships all have character and interest whereas these two have very little going on.I think that for the row boat this kind of works. Its a small asset and adding too much noise may drown it out.However I really think the red barge needs something. Compared to the others its just so sad! It could have something in its bed or the cabin could have some more character maybe.Otherwise great work as usual!,kenney,d63n2ah,1,t5_31h20
