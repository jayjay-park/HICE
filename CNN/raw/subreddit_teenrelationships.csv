423183,0,t3_1yxds1,Dont kiss her for the first time in front of people especially if its your first kisses ever. It makes it a whole lot less...special.My boyfriend were sixteen but have been dating since we were fourteen asked me and it was the sweetest thing he ever could have done.We were just snuggling on the couch and he told me I was beautiful and why he thought so. I was already happy because cuddles and compliments and then a few minutes later he told me he really just wanted to kiss me. I grinned and then he asked. He made himself vulnerable to me by admitting he didnt know how that he was scared but that he really really wanted to kiss me just then. That just about melted my heart so I kissed him just gently but it was so sweet.  ,teenrelationships,cfomm6u,3,t5_2t9th

1042580,0,t3_25zgqd,Right Ill get straight into it. At this point youre at makeorbreak point she feels like youve broken her trust. Youre right in that you havent really but you cant help that this is what she thinks.Now what you do next depends. If she says that she wants space for a while then that means she needs some time to think on her own and youve got to respect that. Pushing her and trying to contact her when shes not ready to is just gonna make her feel worse and youll have no chance at all. If she has said or hinted that at some point she will talk to you and hear her out then wait.But if shes rejecting you and she doesnt want to talk to you at all then I think you only have one shot it might sound weird but Im an oldfashioned romantic type and I think it might just work try writing a letter to her. Not a text not a phone call a handwritten letter. Why? Because its more personal its more serious.What should you say in the letter? Everything youve said here. Explain yourself first but then dont beg. Tell her that youre not going to try contacting her again now she has to contact you. It is your last chance so you need to throw it all on the table with this. Letters can be annoying if she thinks that youre acting clingy and persistent but if you clarify that this is the last thing youre going to try then she will take it a lot more seriously. And of course tell her how you feel about her. Its a bit of a placebo but if its handwritten it is more personal it might just touch her.This really is your only shot if the latters the case. Only other thing I can say is good luck hope you get through to her.,teenrelationships,chmsnu5,2,t5_2t9th
1053309,0,t1_cho0cv8,Spend time with her and talk to her.  Try to steer the conversation away from selfdeprecating comments and just about normal things.

If not go with her and try to sit down with her current friends.In the end though you cant make someone happy who doesnt want to be happy.,teenrelationships,cho0l1m,2,t5_2t9th

2260780,0,t3_2l2z9r,Id say proceed. They are no longer in a relationship and she isnt obligated to do anything for him. If she wants to stay friends with him thats her choice but she isnt obligated to keep contact. Is it immoral? No. Yeah it does hurt seeing your ex with someone else but he needs to get over it. He doesnt seem like a great partner. You shouldnt feel bad about hurting him should it happen. If anything just keep an eye on him for any unhealthy signs.

Im so naive in these kinds of things but Ive been learning a lot lately and what youve said is really helpful thank you! Its been almost  weeks since those incidents and well just last week I did something extra stupid and got her real mad at me. But its not everything and youre right. She has gone through some traumatic past which causes her to have some trust issues i dont know what it is yet though. So ive ruined it to the point where her bestfriend my wingman and her other girl bestfriends say I should give her some space. and i think its right cause her family problems are intense and I dont know what role i play in them at this point her brother attempted suicide. and sorry for that escalation I just hope time is the cure and a little space between us. But in all your response is very helpful and ill be forever thankful and in debt!  ,teenrelationships,crk5jml,1,t5_2t9th
4070045,0,t1_crk7020,Ok just a few suggestions. You can try to prove to her that you are really mature by doing stuff like all your chores without them asking and helping them out with their stuff too. Remember all their holidays such as birthdays mothers day etc. try to ask the your parents when theyre in a good mood ask the one that seems more likely to let you go. Try to give them another reason to let you go maybe like for a research project or something. But if your parents are really strict like you say you just gotta show the discipline that they want you to have. Once they trust you theyll be much more willing to let you go.,teenrelationships,crk7o7x,1,t5_2t9th

5095826,0,t3_3krm33,. Its perfectly fine...dont worry about it at all. Until youre  and shes  and all that theres nothing to worry about and you just have to be careful there..

And then if you get positive vibes I would say ask her out for sure. It sounds to me like she really likes you dude. And as far as hooking up with her ex goes I would just say that everybody has needs. She wasnt in anything committed so she probably fell back on that for physical sake if you know what I mean. ,teenrelationships,cvfjk9a,1,t5_2t9th
5454934,0,t1_cw8rql1,If he tells you he wants to date her before you tell him the right thing will be to give him the opportunity to ask. You can still be friends with her so that doesnt need to change unless of course she tells you its best to not get too close because now shes dating your friend. Its a tough spot to be in because you like her and you enjoy her company but here is where you must respect her wishes and his if it comes down to that. All of this assumes you value the friendship you have with him. If you were to ignore his wish to keep your distance because he wants to now spend more time as her bf then be ready to lose his friendship and potentially hers. Now you may ask well what about if he takes too long to ask her out. Can I then just ask if say he doesnt do anything in  weeks? Again if you dont care about him then go ahead and do as you wish. However try putting yourself in his shoes. Ask yourself would I want my friend to go ahead and ask the girl out after I told him I liked her and want to ask her out? Be honest when you put yourself in someone elses shoes. Basically treat others the way you would want to be treated irregardless of whether you value them or not. Why? Because you never know when you will meet this person again and they will remember what kind of person you are. If you make this a priority as you make decisions about anything you will always have great people and great situations come your way. If you really like her I say ask her out because it sounds like shes a nice girl which means there must be plenty of other guys that will ask her out if you dont. Usually the girls have the upper hand and can take their pick while us guys we dont have that luxury. This is the way it works so I say take that initiative and dont be afraid to express yourself to her. Worse case scenario she says she likes you too but prefers that you stay friends which is not such a bad deal. At least you can say you had the guts to talk to her and tell her how you feel. That requires courage and confidence and I sense you have that. ,teenrelationships,cw8x47c,2,t5_2t9th

5734247,0,t3_3tny5n,Yeah Im in a very similar situation except she knows about how I feel due to a couple of awfully executed attempts to get her to go out with me before she started dating the other guy.. If shes in this relationship do not under any circumstances tell her how you feel. Me doing this almost singlehandedly destroyed my friendship. Really it just gets very awkward and while she may forgive you and try to make up for it its always going to be at the back of your mind that if you even just hint a little to it you lose your best friend maybe forever.. Dont beat yourself up about how you feel. A few months ago I thought I was alone with this issue but more recently it seems that its not too uncommon. While feeling awful about your feelings is what I did it just ends up putting way too much of a strain on your mental health and gets you nowhere.. Now for the hard part find somebody else. Find somebody else youre really attracted to and try doing stuff with them instead. Dont wait until your best friend breaks up to go in for the kill I did this with my friends previous boyfriend and it didnt go well. So maybe even just for the meanwhile try dating another person. Were both guys in our teens Im pretty sure that you think about your best friend not wearing anything frequently I know I do you cant really help it. Instead of imaging your friend try replacing that with the other person. Its tough at first but gets easier over time. I got a girlfriend but its long distance so not the most ideal but if you can focus everything towards another person youll eventually stop caring and just be happy with the new girl rather than miserable with the old one.Good luck buddy this situation hurts like a bitch so I hope you can resolve this soon enough,teenrelationships,cx7w0ye,2,t5_2t9th

7798889,0,t3_4lrlzg,Heres my advice I absolutely think that you should stick by her. Not only that but keep communicating with her about the situation. Come with a different approach. Let her know that you understand her thoughts about a relationship between the two of you but you also know that the two of you will never grow apart. Assure her that if it doesnt work out or its awkward or anything like that youll be willing to call it quits as long as she lets you know that she is uncomfortable with your relationship. If you really love her DO NOT GIVE UP ON HER. Also make sure that what she is saying about her fear of losing your friendship is the only reason she is unwilling to get in a relationship with you. As a girl I can tell you that thats not always the case or at least not the whole story. Trust me when I say that youre in a much better position to be able to talk with her about this than to have kept your feelings for her to yourself. Its much better to know how she feels about it and being honest about it than to be stuck wondering everyday if she likes you back. Communication is key. Hope this helps!!,teenrelationships,d3snm6d,2,t5_2t9th
