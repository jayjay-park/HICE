3191572,0,t1_cor4fgv,Great question and good thinking. Yes most definitely. This view is often called Calvinism or Reformed Theology and instead of believing Libertarian free will we believe Compatibalism aka deterministic free will. This means that man makes free choices but that he wouldnt have made any choice except the one he makes. But that doesnt make it any less his choice. I was predestined choose to ice cream over cake but that doesnt make it any less my decision. Nothing is forcing me to do anything. I made that decision purely on my own. Then what about man and salvation? What we say about man is summed up in an acronym TULIP.TTotal Depravity All of man kind has fallen and no one wants God as a result. Every person is by nature a child of wrath Ephesians . Every person hates the true and living God Romans  and although they know God they refuse to worship him and suppress the truth of God and worship idols instead Romans . No man can be saved unless God miraculously intervenes to regenerate the person and bring them out of their depravity Philippians  John .UUnconditional Election God chose whom he would save and whom he would leave to their hatred of Him before the world began. It had nothing to do with any goodness in themselves but was according to Gods grace Romans  Ephesians  . These people are called the Elect. What is crazy is not that God didnt save some but that God does mercifully save some.LLimited Atonement Christ did not die on the cross for the sins of every single human being. He died for the sins of the Elect only Colossians  John . Notice Jesus says He lays his life down for the sheep not all the sheep. Also notice that He says that there are sheep that are not of His fold. In John  notice how Jesus is praying for the ones that have been given to Him not those who have not. This means the Atonement was sufficient for all and efficient for some. Everyone who will ask for salvation will have had their sins paid for hence it is sufficient for all people but efficient actually matters for some.IIrresistible Grace When God decides to regenerate and thus save someone via the Holy Spirit they will truly be saved. That doesnt mean that the Holy Spirit cant be resisted Acts  but that when God decides to regenerate it cannot be fully resisted Titus  John   Peter  John  is referencing the Holy Spirit.PPerseverance of the Saints Any truly saved person will not fall away. This doesnt mean that they cannot fall away but that God is perfectly keeping people in the faith via any means He chooses. Whether that is His Holy Spirit the warning and encouragement of other believers teachings etc. God can use whatever means He likes but He will never fail to keep a saved person saved. Romans  notice nothing in all creation and since we are part of creation we cant pull ourselves away either  John .Further I think the Bible teaches that God has predestined all things. Here are some verses to ponder. In Isaiah  notice the word Declaring is used and not discerning. Proverbs  Acts   Samuel  Jeremiah  Isaiah  Proverbs  and Proverbs .There are other reasons to believe this to be true. One example is the question If God perfectly knows all future events how did He know them and not predestine them? More specifically how can someone have nondeterministic free will aka libertarian free will and God still know their decisions exhaustively?This was a lot. Feel free to keep asking questions.
