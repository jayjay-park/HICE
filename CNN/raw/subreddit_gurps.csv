267668,0,t1_cf84yjj,Batman is definitely an expensive character. He competes with the smartest characters in the DC universe on par. Hes physically more capable than any normal human too. Added to that the skill list would be immense and his wealthgadget pool would be huge too. ,gurps,cf8i5da,3,t5_2s3if
619950,0,t1_cgapr4c, The Plot Armor idea is a perfect idea. I may add that into the game for those characters that wont choose a power that allows them to directly DR such damage. amp  I am thinking in the beginning of the game there are going to be a lot of societal struggles. Since this is taking place in a the XMen Universe their actions are going to directly influence how quickly such actions like Mutant Registration act come into place. Basically the only alreadyestablished characters that will be in this campaign is Professor X Magneto and a Senator Kelly character.Everything else such as the brotherhood will all be characters I create to fill the rolls.Thanks for the awesome ideas though..especially that Plot trait.,gurps,cgaqma0,2,t5_2s3if
1259245,0,t3_28gvu6,Depends on what sort of Patron the Colonial Marines are to the Players.  Lots of goodies?  Standard grunt loadout?  Forage for yourself?  That is to say you make them buy their own gear with pointsstarting cash.Good armor and weapons can make a huge difference in survivability.  Just make sure they pay for their Patron. ,gurps,ciba3sx,2,t5_2s3if
1372426,0,t3_29t0bf,Mostly sounds like you need to talk to your GM. He needs to give you some direction on all of this... Not going through every item but he should be able to give you general guidelines on what is likely to find and what wont. Thatll solve most of your issues. The one important bit I wanted to address was character agency and disadvantages like phobias  impulsiveness etc... You can happily rp a character with these traits without having them on your sheet... And a good GM will even give you XP for playing well if you do. But if you want POINTS for it... You have to pay a price. Its called a disadvantage for a reason... In DnD terms itd be equivalent to allowing a wizard to geas you in exchange for a magical enchantment to your dex or whatever because in the end that is what youre doing... Youre taking an IMPACTFUL disadvantage in order to be able to enhance some other aspects of your character. Now again a good GM will let you RP this out anyways... As with all game systems only a shitty GM lives and dies solely by the dice rolls. ,gurps,ciobl2x,3,t5_2s3if

2814208,0,t1_cnnthpc,The only supplement to mass combat I know of off the top of my head is in Pyramid  Alternate GURPS  Tactical Mass Combat.  It lets you set up mass combat units on a map and move them around wargame style.  I considered using it for my samurai campaign but I went with vanilla mass combat instead.To clarify my point is that GURPS is pretty flexible and if we know what you want we can probably tailor something closer to your desires with or without the standard mass combat rules.,gurps,cnnyulh,2,t5_2s3if

Or from an alternate reality or different universe. Gurps is about creating the exact character you want to play.

5013031,0,t3_3jk5y9,I find GURPS is easy to grasp for new players due to its basis in realism. For example I told my players this about skill levelsSkill  or lower Its your hobbySkill  ApprenticeInternStudent of the fieldSkill  Professional e.g. if your job is an electrician your skill level is  in the relevant skillsSkill  ExpertSkill  st dan black belt for the lay man you are a masterThen keep those in mind when running the game. If a professional in a given field is faced with a task that they should regularly succeed in either make success automatic or give good modifiers.You should also buy How to be a GURPS GM. It is an excellent book and I consider it part of the core set.,gurps,cuq9cz6,4,t5_2s3if

7714185,0,t3_4kvfd9,Im currently working on this as well for my group. The most helpful thing I have discovered so far is too not convert directly from Dark Souls to GURPS. Many mechanics in the Video Game simply wont work well in a TableTop environment such as when the group dies at a boss and has to rekill everything up to the boss. Grinding might be fun in Video Games but is just tedious in tabletop. The better option is to convert thematically converting the feeling of dark souls the loneliness the hopelessness the madness the feeling of fighting things so much more powerful then you are.,gurps,d3j1t8v,3,t5_2s3if

8884153,0,t1_d7851id,Also possibly reduced time rate? They dont do anything fast and would possibly literally be slower to react by default and generally just always be about a step behind what was going on. Which wouldnt mean they couldnt recognize the chain of events and react. Albeit slowly. Like if an Ent or Treeman gets annoyed at you hitting his leg with an axe and takes several turns to even start lifting his hand he might still manage to turn you into chunky tree fertilizer just because he also used the next few turns after that to evaluate and maybe decided to Beat when he hit you and anyways his reach is quite large to begin with. You might not be able to get away by the time you realize you should be careful and start running or dodging. He might also put up with getting hit for a few rounds to do something like disturb the ground and knock you down that way or chat with the trees you werent paying attention to and have one of them sneak a root up and grab your leg or whatever.Something deliberate and well considered that relies on his ability to take your punishment and then retaliate.,gurps,d7fr01y,2,t5_2s3if
9033474,0,t3_53zkxv,I would apply modifiers for the hand personally. I think of what it would look like to cast the spell if using a staff of some sort youd need to touch the muscles you want to spasm. I figure its the same for if the caster is touching them personally. Up to you but Ill let someone spasm all the muscles in the arm and hand with an additional point of fatigue for the whole limb rather than just the arm and not the hand.,gurps,d7xoicu,0,t5_2s3if

9433561,0,t1_d8fvlhv,I wouldnt allow Create Object to duplicate any existing effects ever.gt Can he create a poisonous gas as long as hes near the edge of the effect?Thats Stench an Air spell. I also wouldnt consider a cloud of gas to be an object for purposes of the spell nor would I allow a gallon of water or other sorts of compound or collective objects of this sort and thats on top of the no duplicating other spells rule Id apply as the water would be Create Water and the gas some variant of Create Air etc.gt Can he blind fools with bright flashes without spending points on other spells?Flashes are energy discharge and not objects. Theyre also the entire point of the Flash spell so youd be getting at a spell from another college with no prerequisites. No duplicating other spells applies here.gt Can he create a cup of acid Create Acid. No duplicating other spells.Simple objects and not duplicating other effects rules out probably  of the munchkin you can get up to with that spell. Warn your player that if they DO come up with a particularly munchkin application you reserve the right to tablerule it on the spot and encourage them not to try to bend the rules too far. BE willing to work with borderline uses and be willing to quash those that go too far whether immediately or as a retcon later.A good player wont need the reminder and a willing player wont try intentionally to break your game with it.,gurps,d9brpdz,1,t5_2s3if
