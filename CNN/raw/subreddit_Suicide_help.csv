11713164,0,t3_674xwg,Dont do it. Im not sure how much help I can be as I came here for similar reasons but I dont think your life insurance pays out for suicide. That wouldnt help her at all and the weight of losing you both would be to much for anyone. She needs you. This will pass. Work on you. Talk to a therapist. Find something that makes you happy. Is there any hobby you have always wanted to try? Dont wait. Grab on to something to take your mind off things. Draw. Write. But a camera and go out and take pictures. Anything. Its all temporary. Every struggle and pain you are dealing with right now will pass.,Suicide_help,dgnpt0c,2,t5_3hyjo
