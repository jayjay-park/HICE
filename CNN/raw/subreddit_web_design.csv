Whats the longest domain name you can remember?  Now cut that into  the length because you cant make any assumptions about the intelligence or memory capabilities of your target audience.. Ask a dozen people how to spell the words contained in your domain name and include at least  yearolds in your group.  If one person misspells it you may have a problem.  Repeat the test with different people.  If any of them misspell it again you do.. If you change the spelling of your domain name youre breaking rule .  Its just one more thing youre requiring your users to do so that you can be successful.  Dont try to enforce user behavior  support their normal behavior and spell your domain as they would expect it to be spelled.  There are notable exceptions Flickr Tumblr etc. for example.  But they are exceptions not the rule.. no matter whats on your cardposterad people subconsciously still think .com when typing in web addresses. What will your users search for?

There is a micro instance for editing the content but thats really doing any work only when somebody is changing the content and would easily handle hundreds of users editing their sites at the same time. Another benefit is that as long as S is secure the page cant be hacked and you dont have to keep any server updated. micro instance obviously can be hacked but it is just simple ssh no other services are required and the server is hidden  visitor at no point connects directly to it,web_design,cenzsjp,1,t5_2qh1m

150468,0,t1_cevjsj9,Ok. Wordpress is the perfect tool for those who have other things to do in their life besides their website. Its a simpler tool and for many people that means a better tool. If you really need flexibility for a website youre going to run your business off of though Wordpress begins to reveal limitations and Drupal becomes a better choice. From what Ive seen of your demands youre in agency territory. Agencies with a reputation will charge for simply having a reputation but odds are much better that youre getting your work done by talented dedicated people who wont push you around because of lack of technical knowledge... thats partially because your point of contact may be an account manager who also has little technical knowledge that may or may not be an issue for you. Theres also the overhead of politics and the diminishing return on investment when it comes to having multiple people work on your site. Those things would concern me more personally. Your quotes are going to be all over the map. Its a little bit like saying you want to make a movie and searching for production companies. The prices will vary as much as the quality does. Finding the ones who perform well above what youre paying are out there but it will take considerable legwork and luck. If you decide on Drupal search for Acquia partner finder.

231014,0,t1_cf4oqqv,Your cheapest package is . per month. The average display advert in the footer of a website is going to generate maybe . CPM at best that means to generate the same revenue as  sale on your cheapest package you need to generate over  advert impressions. Many years when I was a teenager I ran my own cutesy little hosting company I generated lt page views per month and had around a dozen customers so you can see how the math shows it isnt worth it.If your advertisement turns away just one customer who thinks ew that is so unprofessional someone like me... or anyone with any web experience  your audience! youve just punched yourself square in the wallet. My point is that advert is going to generate literal pennies if youre lucky youll make maybe a dollar or two... is a few dollars worth the potential of turning off customers? Just one customer walking away because of that grossly amateur move is a big financial hit for you.Youre bat shit crazy if you think it makes any sense to use display advertising on a business website and if the few dollars you could potentially generate are important enough for you to take the risk youre making a big mistake trying to operate a hosting company.,web_design,cf4oy1g,3,t5_2qh1m

Plus dogs value self reliance. As do I. I am not a dog.It sounds like youre looking for feedback designwise so for what its worth The yellow square is a little loud for my taste speaking very subjectively. Less subjectively  I am not clear on why you chose to make  the minimum width when there is nothing that wouldnt scale down to  more or less. If its a dependency of whatever popup plugin you were using then you could certainly roll that piece yourself with minimal difficulty if you wanted to and get this looking spiffy for mobile and below as well.

353908,0,t3_1y0qei,Im the frontend guy for our company and Im about to lose my head over the fact that I never see a project until after clients have approved a design mockup.  Now my art guy is great  hes a nice guy and very talented artist but six months after my arrival he still cant remember to use fonts from one of our various webfont licenses that sliders are generally useless or bother to give mockups for any media breakpoints below px.It occasionally feels like Im just a PSD slicer.

Dont use margins based on px use  instead. It might help your spacing. You might even try something like Bootstrap or even a simple css navbar setup you crib from somewhere so that its more responsive to the size of the users browser.Quick fix If you include a negative paddingbottom or marginbottom to only show up during the hover  to counteract the added borderbottom the problem might disappear.

When you get to the page and first get the gateway page you skip past andor the initial light box popup you close is annoying enough.  Worse is when a second popup comes asking you to subscribe to their site.  On mobile I get annoyed that Im one paragraph in and then Im bounced to the app store with Candy Crush shown to me. Very annoying.Im surprised these sites do not bounce adblock users to a  page or some page that wont allow users to see any content unless they turn off the adblock.To this day I have friends asking me why I wont put banners on my food blog.

The top navbar is positioned using the property positionfixed so its taken out of the documents normal flow and is always at the same place in the viewport. You should check out more documentation on positioning as its a really powerful layout tool CSStricks or Mozilla documentation should get you started but the best way to learn is experimentation!. He links to the containers using links which are pointed to the ID of the div. So one div has the idabout and to link to it he puts in a normal link lta href but instead of putting a different html page as the href attribute he uses the id of the section he wants the browser to scroll to so lta hrefaboutgt. Again try this out for yourself its pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Im  certain someone else can correct me if Im wrong but Im about to run out the door and dont have time to dig deeper  that the smooth scrolling is accomplished via javascript but I dont know what tool since Ive never had a use for that particular effect myself.

This is just an example.After searching around with google I have found my answer for this problem. you can limit your website minwidth. But this will make the website zoomed in when you first load the website if you use        ltmeta idviewport nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscalegt. To solve that issue we can dynamically change the viewport width with our minwidth. By using javascript we can change that if anyone can make this script more simple ill appreciate it because I am not an expert in js        ltscriptgt              var vp  document.getElementsByNameviewport        window.onload window.onresize  limitviewport        function limitviewport             if document.documentElement.clientWidth lt              vp.setAttributecontent width initialscale                         else             vp.setAttributecontent widthdevicewidth initialscale                            ltscriptgtIn my opinion this wont affect a lot because nowadays people device width mostly over px. And with this you can design effectively because you have a limit for minimum width of the website.But I am curious I want to hear what do you guys think about limiting our web layout by giving it minwidth? is it affect the user experience browsing our website?For the nd So I start with the smallest screen right wo using media queries? and after that we use css media queries when our content is break ex media minwidth px and maxwidth px?,web_design,cge277t,1,t5_2qh1m

Ill just go elsewhere. For bad sites that hold some monopoly on something I need I put up with their problems and use them as little as possible.Even if youre not directly generating ad revenue for a bad site by using it you are still giving them attention and probably referring other people there.

725143,0,t3_22gi1s,I dont like the hover effect on the top links its too slow and it loses contrast against the background almost as if its disappearing.The scrolling is awful. It doesnt make any sense to do it like this. Often it scrolls too much that there is text between that I cant read I can only see it when its transitioning between states. And it loops back round which is annoying behaviour. If Im scrolling down by holding the down arrow I want to be able to be reckless. Lots of people who try to interfere with scrolling dont really know why theyre doing it they just saw it somewhere else and thought it was an impressive effect.The text with the image background is difficult to read in places because its black text on a dark grey image.It looks nice though.,web_design,cgmpaet,1,t5_2qh1m

Its just as easy for my to ctrlc ctrlv that link into my Facebook status box then remove the actual URL text and post a nicelooking share of an article on my own.  And thats probably how most of his  webpages... readers felt too.There is a demographic though that doesnt really care about which sites have their information.  They hit like and share on everything and flood newsfeeds with all of that.  They would like the buttons because its  clicks and youre done.  Older people people who dont like technology.So for articles on web design topics assuming its mostly web designers reading them and not grandmas sharing cute I love my daughter image macros then the social media sharing buttons could be eliminated.

The Fork Me graphic covers the menu button still though on my MacBook with the browser set to  px in width. Beyond that the menu expands to the icons on the left  this doesnt happen on my desktop though.That technique makes sense for the scroll handler where you can get into trouble with it firing too often but it doesnt seem terribly applicable to the resize handler.

903570,0,t1_ch6smmk,I would argue that for those sites and most who use a carousel effectively that there is very little front page traffic coming in that doesnt understand the product or what they are looking for. The situation its a bad design element for is exactly the situation most of us are in we are NOT building Amazon or NBC.com. We are building sites that are new and therefore will get a lot of front page traffic that is trying to figure out what the site is for who the company is etc. If these pieces of information were a foregone conclusion then a carousel might be fine we wouldnt care too much about the click through rate because thats not how the traffic happens on those sites.I equate the use of a carousel in a small site to a small dev shop thinking they need to implement full on agile development processes when they have  developers who all site in the same space youre seeing a behavior from a large company you want to be and copying it even though their solutions only work at their scale. All that being said I havent built a site without a carousel on the front page in like  years.

You seem like you want to get back into the swing of things but if youre anything like me then you need to find a facet of the industry that excites you. Why dont you pick up a fresh language? A lot has changed in  years with the gaining popularity of languages and tools that didnt even exist back then.From my experience of networking and talking to others in the field there is a lack of PHP developers  maybe thats something youd be interested in?

1013385,0,t1_chjfeph,My very first impression was Where should I look first?I think there are too many colors. Brown green dark blue cyan light blue icons red dots white background at the top etc.I would narrow it down to a selection of  colors. How about some brown green and white only? It would support a clean image. It would immediately tell me Oh this is about nature.Also the two boxes to the left have a brightermore aggressive color while the most important thing the queston area is in a not so attention creating color.Make it easier for new users to draw the attention to the middle of the page with a bettr focus on color usage.PS Thats my personal opinion. Taste differs. But this was my initial reaction to itEDIT Just tried something real quick Im not happy with the colors myself so far but it was quick work.

1040835,0,t3_260qe7,I do web dev on a Windows  PC. I chose this over a MacBook after working with OS X for  years. Although I found OS X adequate it is like you said not great in performance. I work with a pretty standard LAMP stack  but instead of WAMP or something like that I run an Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox. With SSH enabled and folders shared with SMB it is quite effortless  but with the advantage of having a real productionlike environment running in a safe sandbox.Why? I need to run Adobes Creative suite for my work too. Cant get that in Linux. This way I get the best of all worlds the way I see it.

1052661,0,t3_2656f3,I would love to have a TEXT ONLY version of websites that offer news or content that is usually very static.  Reddit is a good example of minimal markup and maximized content.I read news articles from reddit on my phone often and I find I have to wait for a full page with Images CSS JavaScript et al to load to begin reading text.  This is not a problem on a desktop or laptop with much faster processing and internet speeds but on a phone it adds to the tedious nature of the tiny device.On some fancy sites the pages wont even load on my phone.  The browser looks like it downloads something and just displays nothing.  The more scripts and features being added to these pages are preventing the content from being delivered. Now the tough part about my problem is that reddit wouldnt link to just news articles in their text form so it would only benefit me if there was a setting to turn the link into the plain text form without any additional work by me the user.Nowadays we dont even have the classic printer friendly version of content.  Some sites like CNet dont have a printer friendly version and sites like CNN have resorted to a tool that is great for actually printing the article but to read it and send a link to that printer friendly version is lost.Websites today have turned away from being content delivery mechanisms and have transformed into metadata collecting instruments all at the expense of the content.rant,web_design,chnxxmr,2,t5_2qh1m

If you want to give it a try  One other one that Id recommend is FoundationPress  I havent used it personally but its built on top of the Foundation framework which is just as good if not better than Bootstrap. ,web_design,chupons,2,t5_2qh1m
1120273,0,t1_chvm0hm,Many designers or developers who have to work for clients that want one or the other but refer to it incorrectly. The two are different things and not mutually exclusive. If you tell me you want a parralax site and I quote you for a parralax sight and then you tell me you actually wanted shit to fly in form the sides when you scroll down then I will have to requote and you probably wont like it. And since I work for a marketing company if we are also doing the marketing for your website I may try to talk you out of scrolljacking in particular if it sounds like it will be too intrusive since part of what people pay for is consultancy and  of scrolljacking sites I see are horrible for usability. As both are getting more and more popular this is becoming more of a problem in the industry and a lot of designers and developers are already complaining about it.

And as I did in the first line of my last post I still dont agree.gtWhy in the hell do we need  weather apps that all do the exact same thing? We dontAnd this gets to the nub of my point. The others arent doing exactly the same thing. They are all or at least mostly from what I can see in that image doing a slightly different thing  presenting subtly different information or presenting it in a way that they believe is clearer or potentially getting it from what they believe to be a better source of data. Any one of those reasons could be an improvement on whats already there.The point is that there isnt only one way to attempt to solve a problem  throwing out everything thats been tried before and tackling it in a whole new way is one approach but so is building incrementally on whats gone and probably worked before. Its the equivalent of kaizen v kaikaku in lean thinking terms. Both approaches are valid in their place but kaikaku can only ever be done in addition to kaizen not instead of it  most improvement typically comes from kaizen.,web_design,ci1cpg9,1,t5_2qh1m

1192467,0,t1_ci2xtpy,Both of those are terrible pieces of advice for a first time programmer. Learning how to code with PHP isnt sensible it should be a second or third language in my opinion. It allows incredibly unsafe programming which for a newbie makes you think that its OK. If you did most of the stuff you do in PHP in C C Java etc youd end up with broken shit everywhere. PHP makes it really difficult to learn another programming language.WSchools is actually terrible for pretty much the same reason. If you already know the language and are just googleing something for reference its fine. If youre learning a language it really doesnt help at all.

I personally prefer git.Another great tool is Vagrant to set up virtual machines that would match specifications for your production environment or close to it. This also lets you set up clean environments when you are working on multiple projects.Im going to take a guess youre on a windows machine and theres a very good chance your website will be on linux. This doesnt really matter as much with Wordpress as you can run it just fine on Windows servers as well. I just find the linux command line to be a great tool in my workflow.Theres a ton of documentation out there. If you check out rwebdev they have a decent post on their sidebar Some of these may not apply to what youre doing now.If you feel like youve got a good grasp on CSS and want to reduce repetitive styling or have more advanced functionality such as variables in your CSS minifyreduce the filesize check out LESS or SASS These are CSS precompilers.Times have changed from  years ago quite a bit.

1436504,0,t1_ciwc6cc,Sorry I was a bit shit with my explanation.Generally my bots do something like this.  Pull latest version out of git into a staging area either alongside the production or on a separate server.  Run doctrine commands to ensure database it up to date. this is a certain type of database abstraction which allows you to version control your database structure and have it update automatically but if you dont do this the database updates will be manual  Run automated testing and send the logs to my email.  Install any new assets css  js  images and run minify tools on them.  Run composer install to ensure servers are up to date with my local work.This allows me to ensure the build process was good and do some final testing before doing the same thing on production.You dont need  servers I often do it using  VPS or even  VPS that shares sites in different areas and  local VM local VM is for rapid development and just maintain two copies of the site on a single server staging  production.If you would like more detail about setting up something like this let me know.,web_design,ciwcbz6,3,t5_2qh1m

1492917,0,t3_2bac0w,Well Im almost  and looking at a nd kid and Im seriously considering switching my career to web designdevelopment so Id say youre way ahead of me.That said  months is a very tight deadline for making a living in a new field.  The way Im playing it is Im still working at my regular fulltime job and learning on the side and doing a bit of smalltime lowpay freelancing. Ive found you learn more through actually doing jobs than you do through the theoretical study.If it was me and I was worried about paying the rent and putting food on the table Id first find a solid paycheck and then upskill till I was ready to transition careers.Thats the play it safe call. However after you think through the logic and rationale dont be afraid to dispense with all that and follow your instinct. You are a bit younger than me and not worried about letting a baby suffer etc.. so yeah you can probably take a few more risks.  Maybe you can find a lowpaid internship and just get by while learning the trade. I mean things like rice and canned tuna dont forget those cans of smoked oyster and sardines for variety! and bread and eggs and ramen noodles cost very little if you are worried about eating.  Rent can be harder. Do you have a parent with a spare room? If so problem solved! Hey I never said it would be comfortable!Anyway Dont put yourself in too tight of a position if youre stressing too much but do realise you can easily give up a lot of your lifestyle and reduce your costs if your wife is supportive as well.Also dont overlook furthering your official education. Though you seem able to learn on your own the advantage of going to an institution for learning is the contacts you make and for preparing you to more officially launch into this industry.  I had a Brotherinlaw who got a legal degree on loans and grants while living on welfare while he had three kids. They got by as a family for years without either parent actually working that much.  And before you say hey taking advantage of the system like that is not cool. Its actually what the welfare system along with grants and student loans were made for...that is a stopgap for people inbetween places and jobs...Id much rather see a family leaning on the government for a few years and for one of them to become a successful lawyer and repay his student loans than someone living on welfare as a lifelong habit...but anyway Im starting rant...So yeah go for it. Play it safe to a certain degree if you feel you need to but also dont be afraid to take risks if it scares you. And remember there is almost always a way to do what you want to do so dont give up or be discouraged no matter what especially if your heart is really in it.,web_design,cj3eu7j,1,t5_2qh1m

I mean  Im not sure what budget we are talking but unless you paid . for it theres no need to get depressed.However there are some things that need to be fixed The site is really weird on a smaller width like everyone else already pointed out. I find that the menu bar on the left is very cramped on the right side. I understand that they dont want to make it wider but the menu ends immediately after the G of ticketing. On that note I dislike the fact the menu items and the TICKETING of the logo arent aligned properly. I kinda dislike the amount of shades of blue thats being used.

1777521,0,t3_2eujd2,Usually the sites you are looking for implement their own frameworks or use thats more fine tuned for the needs.Bootstrap for one has way too much bloat. And even if they did use the frameworks they wouldnt use it as a whole usually. Theyd customize the classes and components and use that version.Cant vouch for Foundation. Havent used it yet. I might move over to Foundation in the near future since the design looks better than Bootstrap. As of now I am happy with Bootstrap for quick mockups and small sites. Otherwise I just use custom CSS.The reason you see portfolio and other smaller sites use Bootstrap is because those sites are presentation oriented and not code  delivery optimized most of the time.,web_design,ck37m97,3,t5_2qh1m

A couple of things the pageload speed is a little sluggish perhaps minifying the JS would be an idea try and get everything into one request high latency but high bandwidth so youre better off with a chunky single request than a dozen smaller ones.The images in the slider on the homepage could be of higher quality they look particularly grainy on my largest monitor.Final point the two icons on the top right for contacting you it would be ideal if their functionality was duplicated in the footer yknow make it real easy for folk to contact you AFTER theyve scanned the page.But all in all top notch first website!

And if I say basics I mean learning about different layouts how to use colors and fonts.While you  are learning the design theorie start out learning HTML and CSS. Everyone can learn it but not everyone can write clean and semantic HTMLCSS to make it look good crossbrowser I look especially at IE versions.Alongside with that look at JavaScript. It is very important that you know how to use it to create outstanding website effects.If you did everything above you are ready to move on to learn about CSS Grids.

2001439,0,t1_cku8k28,No problem! Using GitHub is great because it will allow us to push code to a central online repository where anyone can grab a task complete the task then offer it for the mods to review and then eventually merge into the project assuming theyre happy with it. If we want to use a more solid system for project tickets for organizational purposes we can use something like PivotalTracker or something for tracking tickets then GitHub to organize the codebase.It will require getting an account to GitHub which everyone should have anyway. Its one of those things where its not too challenging to learn but is immensely helpful in ones career.

2099079,0,t1_cl6m7ab,I think I disagree. This design might have too much whitespace but it isnt an abomination. Actually this makes the reddit page a lot easier to initially read and understand. Plus the size of the header could be uniformly rolled out to the subreddits and the whole site could be a uniform blob. However the space in between different reddit posts is way too much. This is probably where people are thinking the padding is way out of hand. Slim it up a bit there and.. depending on the activity that occurs when you scoll Id love to see just the middle section scroll and the left and right sides stay static so it is very easy to switch subs andor view other upperlevel information the top banner could be automatically slimmed to allow for more content. That means only when you are at the top of the page do you see that massive header. Anyway I like it. Kudos. ,web_design,cl6n0u8,3,t5_2qh1m

2142759,0,t3_2jir8g,While PDFs may be annoying in certain situations your post is only looking at a small part of the PDF ecosystem.As for the proprietary format stuff other commentators have already mentioned that it was opened up years ago.PDFs are used heavily for print material which still constitutes a massive amount of published work. Not just posters business cards and magazine spreads being sent to printers but also a massive breadth of less glorious collateral. Think material data safety sheets technical bulletins process documents etc.Sure some of that will eventually be need to be distributed publicly over the web but not all of it. HTML probably has at least a little growing to do before it can truly offer the fine grain control over color layout and consistency that print designers and printers require. Current print ecosystemstools are very mature and working to more easily allow for creating responsive digitally minded materials. This bridge between print and web had to be crossed somewhere.

2163130,0,t3_2jsw3s,Everyone works differently and theres quite a bit here which is not being described which could change everything. But Ill give you my reaction based on what you provided...gt Currently Im creating a bunch of sites for an agency. It sounds like youre on the outside as a contractor but thats not clear. gt  Theres no budget.Is that some kind of Matrix spoon reference? Of course theres a budget otherwise no one would be working. If theres no budget to cover work then work doesnt get done. I know every agency pushes the boundaries of good faith in that regard but there are limits. If they have locked you up for a few months youre pretty much working for salary welcome to agency life. If this is a week spent to bang out a few comps or skin a few wireframes then they need to choose wisely how they will be spending their your limited time. gt Layered PSDs with no smart objects as requested by dev. Makes sense to meThe lack of smart objects is a bad thing. Smart objects are how retina assets get embedded so you dont have to track down the designer for AI files or hires originals later. gt UI Template with Button states complete semantic HTML all H tags hot link states ordered and unordered lists etc Fair enough. This was included and expected before the project started I hope.gt Heres what they want but I dont want to do for free ...What they want is a detailed style guide. If vague terms like that were used in the SoW without further clarity its difficult to say how to proceed. You may have to chalk it up to a live and learn experience. So the remainder is my world...gt   SVG exports  UI template with Form styles table styles list of web fonts usedBasically their own customized bootstrap. The web fonts used should be a given you shouldnt be using any more than  anyway.  I understand the desire to have forms and tables done since that always lands in the developers lap somehow  but addressing styling needs for every scenario isnt really practical. Forms especially are a UX issue which should be run through a formal design process. Every. Form. Even a login form. You should be able to provide specific styling before the project is complete because this should be laid out before the project begins. gt Specs on paddingmargin on all elements fonts and sizes border widths everything written outIts a dev thats incredibly tired probably inept thats not an insult its a reality in regard to skill set at making design decisions and wants something to refer to when new pages are needed.  This way they can be the designer after youre gone from the project without having to think about it... Thats not practical. Use ems for padding distances. Elements should be a minimum of  em. . for divider scenarios and  ems for content separation. Beyond that its not reasonable to provide dummyproof guidelines to the point where youre turning developers into designers. gt What do you think? I would try to get to the bottom of what theyre after and see if you can satisfy their concerns with quick turnaround work. Sometimes what they are trying to achieve isnt always apparent in what theyre requesting. If they are indeed trying to get materials which let them effectively extrapolate existing comps into new ones thats... naive. Detailed style guides on the print side are something even branding guys who create the documents rarely follow and even getting something like that done is in the realm of big budget. At some point its reasonable and expected to push back with Im well beyond the hours you have paid for. ,web_design,cles7ro,3,t5_2qh1m

2284453,0,t3_2lep01,Hi James.Good idea! Ive always liked the concept of clearing the user of as many clicks as possible to login andor register. The fewer the clicks the faster the process the more likely the user is to actually register in the first place.One small suggestion. Their name shouldnt be required during the registration process if you can help it. Its one more box the user has to fill in to make the transaction. Try letting them register first then sliding out a new set of elements to put in their other information with a skip button at the bottom. User enters email User enters password User clicks register Registration successful message shows Enter name dob etc... or skip to the contentThis way you are provoking the user to make a commitment without forcing them to make it. If they like the site theyll stay and fill out more details.  they just wanna see what the sites all about...Brad.,web_design,clu2pym,3,t5_2qh1m

2455424,0,t3_2nnbwy,This is a long article which is quickly derailed from its introductory point of one trick agency ponies. I appreciate the hard work put in here but given the topic some brevity is in order and perhaps unwittingly highlights its own problem.Im not sure how  steps of strategy are spelled out without once mentioning the word customer or user or any of its variations. Forget what google tells you about the definition of strategy. The point of strategy for an agency is to understand your customer. Its the exploration of your relationship between your brand and the people. Who they are what they want how they think where are they going to be in a few years from now and so forth.  By extension this tell you who your competition is and where your clients product sits realistically in the market. gt . Win an election for examplegt . Increase revenuegt . Increase profitgt Thats it. There arent any others. You create your strategic plans based on one or more of those three by attaching a specific number to each.If those are you only goals youre playing a fools game. Theres a difference between products you want to buy and products you want to own. When youre chasing revenue you tend to create products that people want to buy. When you win the hearts of your customers you create products people want to own. The difference in language is subtle but the difference in culture and strategy and the resulting customer loyalty is profound.The flaw in the painting of the big picture is already becoming apparent. A strategy without a customer. Goals driven only by numbers and revenue. Where do the people come in? People as in your customers people as in your clients. A marketing agency above all other services should understand that perception is everything and it exists only inside the mind of the beholder it does not necessarily coincide with reality. Agencies get dumped when they think theyre doing a good job because they have been busting their ass and working late hours. They rely on stats and complicated structure analysis as evidence of awesomeness. But theyre unable to acutely justify their existence they have stopped marketing.Marketing is the art of concise and simple thoughts and when that gets lost youre asking your client to navigate their way to a positive image of you. A mountain of overanalysis is actually drowning your core message and no one is ever checking the heartbeat of the audience for which this is all intended. Its not the onetrick ponies that get shot its the notrick pony who stopped performing. ,web_design,cmf6xtd,4,t5_2qh1m

2495398,0,t3_2o6wfb,Nobody can give you even a rough estimate as long as you dont define what exactly this site should do. Is it just some business presentation with lots of static text and images and the only interaction is an email button? Then maybe in the four digit area depennding on how fancy it should look Or does it need more functionality like user registration customers amp candidates managing projects other data driven content like say a job board just not fully open to everybody but somehow managed by you? Then expect this to be something in the serious five digit area again depending how much work exactly is to be done.All this based on the work being done by professionals. You can try to get it for cheap from some student indian company or whatever and chances you pay more in the end and have some angry customers when stuff doesnt work. Or you may be lucky and this works out better than expected what is not absolutely impossible. Company I work at outsourced some stuff to some company in Vietnam.

2515855,0,t1_cmmlnfn,The basic principle of gulp is that it has a series of tasks. Each task is a pipeline like a garden hose pipe. The pipeline runs from one point to anothergenerally from the source directory of your appusually known as src to the destination directory usually known as dist. The effect of that is that you can splice in tasks and plugins to do things for you on the way from A to B. So an app to minify all the js for you might look like this    var uglfiy  requiregulpuglify          concat  requiregulpconcat    gulp.taskminifyjs function        gulp.srcpathtomyfolderofjs        .pipeconcatall.min.js        .pipeuglify            mangle true            preserveComments some            output                 beautify false                            .pipegulp.destappjs    That gulp task would grab all the JS in the pathtomyfolderofjs directory concatenate it all into one file the minify the whole thing and dump it into appjs. The nice thing about this how flexible it is. So say you want to add a copyrightbranding header just before you dump it out to file....just pipe it to gulpheader first. I was introduced to gulp by a guy that I work with and Ive loved it ever since. Its a thousand times better than grunt In my opinion.Right now I have a gulp setup for one of my apps that  as well as minifyinguglifyingconcatenating all my cssjs and compressing my images  it also pulls in bower dependencies. So say I need jQuery in my app  I just add it to my bower.json file and restart gulpforgot to mention gulp also has an inbuilt web server that does live reload and browser sync etc and its just there in my app I have gulp create one minified file of all application js and one of all my dependencies js.Hope this helps if not  AMAAsk Me Anything about gulp,web_design,cmmyks3,1,t5_2qh1m

You can spend hours making a pixel perfect mockup at px but then how is it supposed to look at px? ? ?

2681208,0,t3_2qqa76,Biggest complaint would be the scroll jacking. Its really unpredictable and rigid IMO. I am on a touchpad so maybe that has something to do with it.Going one page at at time I had no problems but when I tried to go across multiple pages like from the bottom to the top it seemed very inconsistent. Sometimes I could go the length of the site in one swipe while other times it would get stuck on a page and I would have to let up to continue going.Personally Im pretty against scroll jacking so maybe Im just being picky but it was driving me nuts. It felt like one of those video game tutorials where if you deviate even the slightest bit from what they want you to do the game just takes over and yanks you back on course.Other than that beautiful site.

Too many graphics like the browser icons in beakers the icons in The Process sections and the styles around the down arrows make your site feel prosthetic or generic. With such nice logo color scheme etc its a waste for your site to come off as a cookie cutter web company. Take a quick look at most of the themes on Theme Forest and youll see what I mean. Its over designed that doesnt provide enough breathing room.Honestly I still think its better than  of the content out there.

2802958,0,t1_cnmm5km,Heh.I am very aware of those services believe you me.  I knew about YouTube Music Key several years ago when I did my initial research on whether I should start this project or not.Mostly I think two things Google is still acquiring other musicrelated services. They recently purchased  So I think that Google is big enough to have other services. YT Music Key still provides an API for audio albeit through a paid subscription service. If Google was really thinking about shutting me down I suspect that it would be a better move to try and reuse Streamus as the extension for YT Music Key subscribers rather than just closing shop.However Ive tried a LOT to get in contact with YouTubeGoogle and theyve been pretty silent. So its all just my thoughts without really backing.And yeah a few people have mentioned the icon. I guess its a good problem to have but Ill try to clean it up at some point.

2880510,0,t3_2t1wpl,The reason youre seeing this is the font is optimized poorly for hinting. This is the fault of either the font designer or its implementation as a web font by the programmer. Most likely one of the two didnt put in the effort to properly hint the font. On a pc hinting strongly snaps the edges of the letters onto the edge of a pixel on the screen which is why the thin parts of a letter effectively get distorted to less than a half a pixel wide snapping makes them  pixels wide. On a Mac it does not use hinting at all no matter if its retina or not which is why macs fonts seem a bit or a lot blurrier but more true to the designers intent. PCs with higher density screens tend to render slim fonts pretty well as the hinting has less strong of a distorting effect.,web_design,cnvilmi,1,t5_2qh1m

2927198,0,t3_2tnxg9,Vapor ware until they actually launch something. Anyway from what I can parse out from their demos the Grid is in fact built on templates with each bit operating as a module with variable values to effect things like color. For example if you upload a image for a page header the backend will calculate the images average hex value do facial recognition for the image and then align it and do whatever autocorrectionprocessing said grid utilizes. If youve ever used SASSLESSs color manipulation capabilities l you have a pretty good idea of what youll be getting shades complementary colors etc as gathered from the image.So will The Grid make you a better website than SquareSpace? Yes provided that you are in the market for a single page website. The Grid hasnt really demonstrated much in the way of consistency across multiple pages yet.Does it threaten web designers? Well if your business or occupation was already under threat by SquareSpace then you will be just as threatened by The Grid. If you are up market then this will be a nonfactor.That said I do think that design automation is something that is coming. I dont think that its a future like The Grid is promising.

Some characters are extremely simple just one to ten strokes. Some are over  strokes. Even if they write them legibly the stroke order may be incorrect and fail their test. gt ...youngsters today are not forced to study and they never write letters or essays by hand said Toshiko Marks a professor at Shumei University.Bullshit. I can only hope thats based on a bad translation. I was teaching in elementary junior high and university just two years after this article was published. Lots of handwriting going on.

3176893,0,t3_2wgfmr,What you should expectDefinitely a content specialist. People with legitimate understanding of language information architecture communications and content usability are few and far between. Try searching for alternatives to the content specialist title and acquire the skills described in related job descriptions. Ignore the computerspecific skills in favor of the processrelated skills. In particular look at processes related to user experience accessibility and content usability. Your contribution will be in the form of analysis heuristic or otherwise strategic planning documentation and copy. The maturation of the industry has turned the generalist nondeveloper web designer role into a dead end. In large institutions it is largely filled by technical intermediaries as a secondary responsibility.Meanwhile writing for the web is a complete discipline. Theres a bit of a divide between whats needed for interactive elements and articles. The aforementioned skills will prepare you for both. The work youve done on treehouse will smooth the process.What you should knowHere are some key terms you should know. These definitions should be taken with a grain of salt but should provide some guidance.Usability the ability of users to complete critical website tasks. As a discipline its the assessment and application of findings to improve this ability.Accessibility the ease or difficulty with which web content can be consumed under unpredetermined constraints. These constraints include but are not limited to special needs users the nonsighted and special conditions users someone working from a shaky train.Information Architecture The organization of content and tools as they pertain to the process of finding the design of content relationshipsUser Experience UX The process of identifying meeting and exceeding user expectations through the application of implicit signals and explicit task flowsUser Interface UI Software representations of a user experience as opposed to software representations of business logicGraphic Design The creation of aesthetic elements of an interfaceEach of these is a different field though many jobs may mix and match responsibilities from among them. The advantage of content management tools is that they help people who create content reuse the work product of people in these disciplines. editformatting,web_design,cora893,1,t5_2qh1m

That puts you in the ring with SquareSpace Wix and GoDaddy the proverbial  lb gorillas. Thats pretty much what they sell except GoDaddy also sells vaguely legal deceit.  I wouldnt battle anyone with a SuperBowl ad without a seriously clever business and marketing plan.Your business model essentially sounds like a dev shop with a maintenance contract. In most cases your client only cares if the website is up and not slow. They may or may not know what cPanel is an antiquated software platform but thats another topic and usually wouldnt know what to do with it anyway. If you want to be at the head of cPanel as it were thats WHM. Traditionally you would purchase a dedicated machine install WHM and set it up as a reseller then let your blissfully uninformed clientele fight for scant resources. But in the age of the cloud that model is a bit like looking up phone numbers in the YellowPages. In any case in general your clients will want to worry about as little as possible.  I would recommend handling hosting installation or registration of any kind for them if you can actually handle hosting yourself Its more difficult on a business level than most people realize. ,web_design,cp9y0b4,1,t5_2qh1m

3479475,0,t3_3031bs,To answer your questions.... Meta keywords are deprecated for most search engines like Google and Bing however at least check some foreign search engines Yandex may still be using them. That said Id still avoid using them.. Id suggest if youre serious about SEO learn what each one of these does rather than looking for a simple answer from us  . The relcanonical doesnt bypass the need for a nontowww redirect. You should decide whether you want  or  Both are valid and both are fine. The important thing is to pick one and stick with it! Im not sure why Facebook was being fussy with you but it should definitely allow a domain name without www. . A note about Google  they are pretty wise about www and non. In fact when you add your site to the Webmaster Tools you can even specify whether you are using www or not in your domain name. However as I said before pick one option and always stick with that. . If youre unfamiliar about what relcanonical does then you really need to read up on it. Making a mistake there can really confuse Google. To think of it simply the canonical tag is basically your way of telling search engines This content is the de facto page on this topic. So if you have numerous pages with the same content throughout your site why would you? then the canonical tag is your way of choosing which page Google will take note of. Likewise it works across sites if you have duplicate content across multiple sites. Usually the canonical tag is just the URL of the current page unless you have specific reasons to change it. ,web_design,cpovw3x,2,t5_2qh1m

3922373,0,t1_cr3dpg7,Your last paragraph is exactly right and gets at what Im saying.... what you describe makes the search a supplemental nav model not the primary... the hierarchical menu structure is the primary model.  And youre absolutely right thats very typical.On this site though search is given basically just as much prominence as the ToC... its not supplemental or secondary at all its JUST as important as the ToC based on its place in the visual hierarchy its size surrounding text etc.  UX research tells us that when you have two competing nav models where theres no clear delineation between primary and secondary users can get confused.  Whether they actually DO or not of course is a matter for a usability study to determine.Your theory that the ToC enforces use of the search is interesting... its certainly a reasonable argument... it may in essence provide guidance for what the user should put in the search box.  Perhaps they did a study that showed exactly that.  In the absence of knowing if thats what they did though Im not sure Id buy it... I think whats more likely to happen with typical users who arent as techsavvy as you or I is that theyll spend time trying to dig down through the hierarchy and if they find what they want then great all depends on how well the data was organized obviously but if they dont then theyll resort to search but thatll be after theyve effectively wasted time.  My gut says thatll tend to be the case more than not but I certainly admit I cant know that for sure without some user observations.,web_design,cr3dxip,1,t5_2qh1m

4068128,0,t3_374roq,Get the degree.I dont have a degree.  Its made compensation negotiation and even approval for my hire much more difficult than it needed to be.Right now I do enterprise consulting with some of the largest organizations in the world. Ive literally circumnavigated the globe in the last two years on UX projects. My portfolio and experience in the industry  years gets me work. As an employee not just as a contractor. I dont have a high school diploma much less a bachelors degree and certainly not a masters or doctorate. I manage teams of other UX designers all around the world. Many of them have degrees but they arent the ones making the final calls.Make of that what you will.The problem with not having a degreeThe fact that I dont have a degree is something I work against rather constantly and only my  decades of experience makes me competitive.  Not having a degree does mean you frequently have to justify why youre the right person for the role. Ive never had this lack come up in conversation after Ive landed a job but getting each job is definitely more of a process.Some background on how not having a degree is okayI would say that a degree is generally required in most job descriptions but this does not mean you have zero chance nor that a degree is the sole method of breaking into the industry. And when I say a degree I mean a bachelors in HCI or UX possibly psychology.  year degrees are generally worthless in the business real world.  Perhaps  of the roles Im presented with require a masters degree or anything else more significant than a year degree. For what its worth I generally hear from recruiters a minimum of  times per week my resume has been around for a while so I see a lot of roles. And almost every one of them while listing an HCIUXcomputerrelated BS degree as required is willing to back down on that requirement when you give them a valid reason. My reason is that I was doing web design and handcoding sites and webbased applications before there was a viable commercial web and long before UX degrees existed. If you have the skills and the portfolio to back them up you will find work.  Itll just be a bit harder to justify picking you over someone else that has a degree if you dont and also harder to get hiredraises at some organizations.  My current organization has a dont hire people without a year degree rule that required Clevel executive approval for an exception in my case.If you have a year degree of any kind you are already better off than that. And if that degree is in a related field such as UIUX HCI design or psychology youll be just fine. A degree in UX is simply put psychology applied to a specific industry.  If you dont have a year degree you can still get work but it is definitely an obstacle and you are competing against hundreds or thousands of others in your industry who do have degrees.  If you have an amazing portfolio and a long work history justifying why you dont need the degree this might not be a problem for you.  But if youre just starting out its really going to be a lot harder without such a degree.Yes get out and practice but dont quit school.  You will regret it later if you do.,web_design,crjztuj,6,t5_2qh1m

CI is a great MVC.  I personally know little about Zend but IBM is behind it now similar to Ellison for CI and is pushing.  So probably theres good future for both CI and Zend.  MVCs come and go.  Asp.net is unlikely to go anywhere due to MSFTs push and core integration in Visual Studio.  Laravel and the Taylor Otwell camp are making waves.  MVC is a great step up for those who wish to learn from WP or Drupal.  True that you can make a lot as a themer for several CMS systems but theres still great opportunity in the future for programmers period.

4410169,0,t1_csmqiyo,I think you are thinking up sells here. If I was selling to a restaurant I wouldnt bring any of this up unless I knew that said restaurant was doing very well for themselves. Maybe mention it as all bonus features but definitely dont make it sound required like you make it sound. A basic website with jpgs of their menus and a contacts page is already leaps ahead of many mom and pop restaurants. This is all of course assuming youre looking for small sales to fill in the gaps between big clients or looking to get your feet of the ground.This is a perfect example of what should be required of all restaurants this restaurant is awesome btw. If youre ever in Toronto give it a visit. Its super simpleterrible but simple has their menus their location when theyre open their phone number for reservations and social networks if youre interested. Everything youve suggested is all just bells and whistles for convenience.Again to me it sounds like youre going for the big budget A client website. Im talking about getting every restaurant a basic web presence to drive them business.

4724280,0,t3_3fm4p6,Yes. Spofify now has this software that creates a playlist of  songs each week that the user should probably enjoy based off of what they listen to every day. that should be a goal of a social network to find out what the users interests are and to provide them with the best available information that that user has never seen or heard of before and make it available with the least amount of effort from the user. Facebook tries to do this but its all ads and useless knowledge. Its like meat with  fat. It will make you sick before you benefit from any of it. Their forum format is the worst. Its not like you can build a conversation of opinions and ideas on facebook and then refer back to it or sticky it for later usage. Reddit has  meat and  fat in the information category the information here is fresh and easily searchable and organized. It could be better of course. However reddit doesnt know enough about their users to make it something where I have my  facebook friends that I can pin point out and associate with or see what theyre up to. facebook has done a lot of things amazingly in this part. Neither of those  mentioned sites have a schedule planner worth anything but they should because why let the business go to someone else when you can easily access more information about a user than competition could given how large facebook or reddit is. Match.com nails down how to figure out what type of person you are. Why are they letting that just get used for significant others? I want to know what people are out there that think just like me so when Im at a plateau I can see what my likeminded peers are doing and get some inspiration about things Im probably interested in.,web_design,ctq1a4u,1,t5_2qh1m

4747085,0,t1_ctsoceb,Basically my goal with it is to understand their audience their goals and their competition. Additionally it works to understand what aesthetics theyre looking for. I tailor my questionnaire based on discussions up to the point where I send it to them I believe its redundant for the client to answer questions to things weve already spoken about.Examples would be. Who are your primary competitors?. How are you different from your competitors?. Describe your ideal customer including their location yearly revenue and services youd sell them.. What are the largest areas of growth you see for your business?. What websites do you like the look and feel of? What elements of those sites really capture your attention and meld with the look youre going for?. What isnt working with your current website? Why do you feel it isnt working?. What are your must haves for this new website?Again really simplistic without asking TONS of pointless questions that never get used. From those few questions I can get a nice reference document when managing the project. Also the questionnaire is a good thing to send when you know itll be something your client will have to think about. Imagine asking those on a conference call...youd get halfass answers for the most part and the substance that comes with thinking things through would be absent.,web_design,ctswyc7,2,t5_2qh1m

4874875,0,t3_3hmwal,Im in the same position. Ive so far only dipped my toes into the world of freelancing wanting to go further. I dont have too much experience but I can offer a few tips that might help you. All my clients so far and thereve been about  so far came to me. It started off with making a website for friends parents who owned businesses. More often than not they recommended me to other business owners who contacted me as well. So Ive never actually sought gigs so I cant offer too much advice in terms of finding work through complete strangers. However if you live in an affluent area I can guarantee you that finding work wont be the issue. The difficult part in freelancing is establishing the foundation of a service in exchange for money transaction. It ends up being a lot more work than just making a website on your free time. Youll need a contract. Youll need a planned workflow. Youll need a payment schedule. Youll need to learn the proper communication techniques. Business is a whole other piece of the puzzle and you must develop your skills in this segment of it before you dive in. If someone is paying you  to do something for them you need to be on top of all of this. Fortunately for me I started off working for people who I had mutual friends with so the process was relatively casual. Ive never used a contract. Payment schedule was lenient. Communication did not have to be perfect. It was a good chance for me to learn as I went. I recommend trying to find work through friends family friends of friends etc. Itll allow you to learn the ropes very quickly and with little stress and youll develop a strong portfolio. If you cant find people within your network to build websites for then your best bet is it sit down and slowly develop a marketing strategy for yourself. Take time to think about it. If you were a business owner what would convince you to pay someone to redesign your website? Make designs for imaginary businesses and show them these designs. Most importantly tell them you will do it for cheap. In my opinion this is the key for freelancers that are starting out. Be incredibly cheap in the beginning and slowly work your way up. I started off charging  an hour. If you have any more questions or if you need some advice on that marketing strategy message me Ill try to help you out. Hope I helped a little. ,web_design,cu90lsw,3,t5_2qh1m

4924770,0,t1_cuf51mb,Thank yougt How to market yourself? Affordable web design is what price? Some say  some say . I would say it is somewhere in between those.Good question.  Im still trying to find that balance.  Right now Im just trying to estimate the time it will take to implement the site based on the number of pages any functions that will be time consuming to implement figuring out how much I want to get paid for that time and then cutting it roughly in half for my first few clients as Im asking them to spread the word. Im also planning to offer a  monthly plan which will include hosting through a third party domain and up to one hour total of updates to the site.  Selecting this option and signing a  year contract will also get the client a discount on the upfront cost depending on the scope of the project.  Ive said I will consult with them on their social media presence but Im not interested in managing the daytoday as that will get pretty time consuming until down the line I can hire someone to specialize in that.  I do understand the social media management can be pretty lucrative though.gt I consider code writing software especially for sites to be bloated with unneeded code.Im only using Dreamweaver as a texteditor and an FTP client Im writing all the code myself.  I suppose I should go with something lightweight and learn git as Im not using the majority of DWs features anyway.gt I can make a WP theme look any way I want. With a CMS including Joomla the presentation is separate from the content. I think you should bother learning Wordpress.Based on the feedback from this thread Im definitely going to thoroughly learn wordpress.

Encourages not styling base level elements which is likely to irritate a backend dev team but it makes everything far more manageable and more lightweight. No more overrides or important tags. Only advice is to not use all the subcategories if they dont apply to your workstyle. Customize it a little bit. Theres a vague difference between objects and components in my workflow and it may vary for you as well.  Also using sass for the nested naming convention works beautifully.  Highly recommend it. ,web_design,cv30ao7,3,t5_2qh1m

5181042,0,t1_cvafos3,Apples uses HLS HTTP Live Streaming. Its an open standard they developed and released back in  and that they submitted to the IETF so that other software vendors could implement it. To date other than Apples offerings only a handful of popular apps have done so VLC Android and Microsoft Edge being the most noteable.Two years after Apple released HLS MPEG released their own adaptivestreaming standard called MPEGDASH which was backed by Microsoft Google Netflix and a number of other tech companies.Neither the HLS or MPEGDASH standards are part of the HTML spec. The HTML spec does define how a web page can interact with video streams but browser vendors are free to choose which formats to support.So its not that Everyone else is using standard web technologies while Apple restricts you to their own shit but rather Apple uses a different open standard than the other guys doEDIT Apple could just serve up the mps the offer to download via an HTML video tag but those are large files which would use a lot more bandwidth and they would probably take a while to buffer.,web_design,cvai7a3,7,t5_2qh1m

I feel like the biggest problems for me at least are making shit responsive  make the cool looking shit be responsive and scale accordingly  optimizing website so it loads fast having an efficiently and not stupidly coded site which helps previous point design colors and typography finding the perfect little css snips to make your site cool but be i.e compatible avoiding JavaScript like the plague unless you really have to This is for static.

5329086,0,t1_cvslq0j,I want to ask a serious question. For more mature and older developers this may seem a silly question but why people must use an old browser to remain compatible with old system? Remember that I am newbie developer which understands web apps in the context of django rails node.js and such.So in my head there could be few reasons. . People must use old desktop software due to some niche stuff with some niche hardware and software compatibility thus they are bound to use some crappy old browser to access internet because desktop OS or hardware is very old.. In the olde days there used to be apps made with frameworks similar to flash can it be called a framework? which must have some kind of plugin to the web browser and the latest supported browser is ltIE. Nobody knows how that app works internally and nobody maintains it and probably nobody knows where sources are and to create a new alternative to perfectly good usable and custom business app will need a gazillion dollars.Am I right?

5347698,0,t3_3o8ynx,As someone who is still in university in the UK currently on a placement year my advice would be that you go to university. Depending on what course you choose you will have enough time to have a side job so possibly seek a web agency to do an internship for honestly paid or unpaid is fine as youll be learning invaluable skills. I did a year free for an agency because they helped develop my skills they offered me a job for when I started university to help with living costs etc. This didnt work out too great for me due to a few issues with my boss but if you find a decent company it will be fine.Not only will you learn and improve technical skills but youll learn how an agency works and how the whole process works. From initial client meetings to releasing the final version of the site.Just a tip I am studying Software Engineering and I found that the web courses offered were very outdated and learning yourself would actually be better for you. The web courses only really touch on the basics if you are more into the design aspect I would possibly recommend you take a graphics design course as the web courses dont focus too much on design either. They are just a step up from basic ICT in my honest opinion. Also whilst youre learning yourself start doing freelance work and youll see your skills develop automatically as youre working. ,web_design,cvv88yq,1,t5_2qh1m

Itll look much nicer and be a fraction of the size. Id also recommend for the background image to save the jpg with progressive compression so the user can at least see something while it loads. The load times should be nowhere NEAR as large as they are!Do bear in mind as well that not everyone has a huge monitor. If you use vw units for your topbottom padding of your intro for example itll adjust depending on how wide the browser is. Throw a few media queries in there so it doesnt get too close to the header at smaller widths and itll be much easier to take in.Finally Id add some padding to the content areas so that content doesnt touch the edge of the screen  currently there are some awkward visual tangents that could be removed with just a bit more padding.,web_design,cvyan4a,1,t5_2qh1m

5555259,0,t1_cwkl0cx,This seems like a customsolution problem rather than just chucking a few boilerplates and themes at WordPress and hoping for the best plus the experience gained would be very helpful.The complexity of the problem isnt too high its just that youd need more knowledge than you current have. Ill give a rundown of the concepts required assuming PHPMySQL but other languages and SQL formats shouldnt change things too muchBackend Language e.g. PHP Python Ruby etc.  Variables  LoopsControl Flow  Arrays  FunctionsDatabase Language e.g. MySQL PostgreSQL MongoDB etc.  INSERT  UPDATE  DDL Or use a tool like PHPMyAdminFrontend HTML amp CSS  Structure  Semantic Elements  ClassesIDs  Box ModelIn my opinion people seem to eager to forgo working with the languages themselves and prefer to immediately jump into frameworks and prebuild solutions. Dont get me wrong those tools are useful when you know what youre doing but if youre starting out nothing beats working from scratch.If you want I can help you out with the project supply help on what needs doing next how to approach certain problems and code debugging and whatnot.

5706092,0,t1_cx4d3pj,My selling point as an individual creative is my visual aspect of a design and how I emulate it to a full functional website whether that be CMSPHPHTMLCSS etcetcetc. When I first started out going into the big bad weekend warrior corporate slave world afew employers even let it slide the fact I hadnt preprepared development for IE for example or my responsive development wasnt AS up to scratch for the sheer fact my manipulation of frontend design was really good which is appreciative I guess or I would be screwed well would have been. Knowledge has definitely changed in the last year or . God really? I worked with a Russian guy once who owned a club but it was dodgy as fuck hahahaha. I started off heavily with music artists in the UK Ive got a fair reputation in my industryscene now so alot of their sites have the BOOM factor if you will but yeah Ive done some fucktard websites where they are adamant they want the layout a very specific way despite professional advice on how god awful it is. I know it isnt the maintaining thats hard its the actual initial creation and time to do so which I find impossible hahahaha and lets be honest  we all slate a developer whos website is WP.

5707560,0,t3_3t11r5,. Font choice is weird the logo looks okay in that font but the rest of the site shouldnt be using it. Some of the content could be shorteneddisplayed differently as it runs over some of the grid lines. While Im on grid lines personally Id remove them this is personal preference though. Lack of interactivity with buttons most have no hover effects and the ones that do could do with transitions. Colour choice is a little strange maybe consider a less saturated blue. Nice to see a site that isnt squashed inside a centered container but that being said layout is the big thing that needs improvement for me.

Time is money so optimise your photoshop layout create swatches reusable components etc.Dribbble also had the daily ui challenge where you could sign up and create a UI every day. Maybe you could do that and do that daily?For coding a decent primer is codeacademy and besides that there are a lot tutorials to be found online.Design is a mindset and if you want to get serious you have to be able to explain to your client why you made certain design decisions.

Dont work for less that you are willing to obviously and find ways to pitch well to higher paying clients.Or be happy to help those who cant afford to pay more theres certainly nothing wrong with that.  You might try invoicing at higher rates and writing off a percentage of the bill instead of simply charging low rates.  You can present higher rates as market rates and negotiate a discount  but this model doesnt suit all clientele.As you up your professionalism and skilllevel and especially as you are able to network yourself and impress larger client companies you can increase your take.,web_design,cy4s4ia,5,t5_2qh1m

A navigation should be that big where it causes a scroll. There are ways to get that much content in there but it requires a bit more designing. Also another good way to get an idea on how to make it more professional the best advice is to read some of these posts here This is actually in the sidebar of the site. There is a lot of good information in here.Another thing I can suggest is look at some simple template websites. Just google HTML Responsive Themes or HTML Responsive Templates.

6491587,0,t3_44j6a9,Hey these are great questions!  As suggested Brackets is pretty great. I think its got great personalization features and its live preview is a HUGE plus. With text editors though Ive bounced between quite a few and I suggest finding what works best for you. It seems like live preview is something that matters to you so Brackets may become your text editor of choice. I use a local virtual server and prefer Atom for my texteditor.   As far as checking for responsiveness you can start by changing the size of your browser window. Additionally Chrome has a great emulation feature in the developer tools I use it frequently. Additionally this tool was posted a short time ago and looks very cool! I havent used it very much but it renders my sites pretty accurately.   For setting up a local server MAMP or WAMP is my goto environment depending. I really like how easy it was to set up and all my projects live in one folder located at the root. But if youre just getting into HTMLCSSJS a local virtual server probably isnt necessary.   Good luck to you!,web_design,czqs1jg,2,t5_2qh1m

This is a good start. I think the most important thing is to get something up and running creating your blogs and seeing what you need. If I were you Id buy my own domain so that if I wanted to move at any time I still have the same domain  it would just point to another host provider not Squarespace.

6723905,0,t1_d0em5a4,I concur. I would highly recommend looking at ecommerce solutions designed already online. The site will be large amounts of work to maintain for one developer he cant just build it and walk away. If you cant pay him a salary its not an attractive option for a developer a lot of people have ecommerce clothing company ideas. There are entire companies built to serve them check scalablepress.com.The realities of web development are heavy building a website and leaving a client with a website they can maintain are totally different. Its the reason why wordpress drupal are so common. And sites like wix squarespace are so popular. They help people build websites that arent developers I would go there for this site. ,web_design,d0et6bd,1,t5_2qh1m

It has bold colors but that has been done before. When Chrome changed its icon people were bewildered. Flat and bright colours were still new then but in todays world they are commonplace. Something being too queer at first sight doesnt always mean that it is bad. With icons especially you should reserve your final word for after you have spent some time looking at it.A good icon isnt only designed for first impressions but for lasting appeal. It needs to stand the test of time to a degree. Sometimes you can achieve that by doing something which is shocking today but not tomorrow.I mightve toned down the colours a bit but I think that this icon is well crafted.

7584902,0,t1_d34ba2d,Sure! These squares are basically spinning on the transform origin so think of the origin like an axle. On a car the tires spin evenly because the axle is directly in the center if you were to offset the axle the tire would wobble. A directly centered transform origin would be   but setting the yaxis value to  very slightly offsets the axle upon which the square rotates.Here is an image showing the square in this example rotated at deg deg deg and deg highlighted in different colors. You can see how despite the curve having the same apex twice each rotation has a slightly different entry and exit path giving the illusion of four different curves. With three rounded squares in play each spinning at a different speed this introduces a lot of perrotation variation creating the effect of a continually flowing wave.,web_design,d34d75g,5,t5_2qh1m

If the request is I need a vehicle that can put satellites and people in orbit every few months reliably different engineers will come up with different solutions but all of them can ballpark that into the dozens or hundreds of billions of dollars. If youre a small business person that answers an important question. No space advertising is not a good moneymaking concept. Stop asking your engineering friends to spitball ideas at cocktail parties. Three or four times a year I get asked by a client to reproduce functionality theyve seen from Google or Amazon.

The Projects are clearly presented.    optimisation     font combinations are to much for the users eye. My Approach would be that you try to use  font with different styles and look how far you can accomplish your goals.   You have too much hover effects. In the Title alone are  different hovers. It looks inconsistent to me.   You like the dark colorsheme. For me it looks like a dark rainy day and not like a strong bold HIRE ME. Try a different one with more warmer vibrant colours.

8105716,0,t1_d4r4rml,Youre definitely bringing up an interesting point and I think its even more perverse than what youre describing and tied to what I mentioned above.Some of the landing pages in the OP are from large SV firms by no means startups anymore that pay their designers handsomely. They still make very minimalistic designs for the most part however tastefully compared to the really cookiecutter BootstrapFontAwesome stuff you see everywhere.The thing is there is a minimalistic trend that may have started with the meteoric rise of Apple and the iPhone thats gone to extremes with flat design my chronology could be completely wrong Im not an industry insider but it seems roughly correct not that I believe minimalism and flat design are anything new. And because of that its become harder for designers to differentiate themselves within that trend. Everybody seems to want their hero shot and their three feature icons with a thin font and portfolios are rife with them.Because of the ever shrinking gap between the results you get with a good designer and a mediocre designer superficially at least theres a price race to the bottom. Sadly people are uneducated about the subtleties of good design and minimalistic design makes those subtleties all the more... well subtle. In other words invisible to most people. And some designers get squeezed because its harder to sell this refinement to many clients.Of course one solution is to not call these guys designers which I dont necessarily disagree with. But it takes us in some notruescotsman territory that is hard to escape.TLDR Minimalism has a depressionary effect on price paid for design due to lack of clear visual differentiation for most clients. Of course thats a theory I just made up for discussion so take it with a grain of salt. ,web_design,d4r5lbl,6,t5_2qh1m
8110545,0,t3_4qbl21,If you charged a client for fixes and didnt actually do anything at all that would be unethical. If you were in the file already and really just had a copy change maybe that could be just tacked onto an ongoing hourly maintenance fee. If they had a maintenance retainer this kind of work would be covered in it. Youre not charging a fee for minor updates youre charging a fee for the  years of school and  years of experience youve had that allows you to make that correction. Youre charging a fee for the receptionist andor client point contact person youre charging for the accountant that makes sure everyone is paid in your company. Youre charging for the janitor that has to vacuum under that desk you spend all day at. To be a successful business person you have to value your time. A successful business person does not bs ever they might come off as arrogant but they are not undervaluing their work. A successful business person also knows when something isnt worth their time and might drop a client entirely if they keep pushing for free lunches minor edits or scope creep.,web_design,d4rp5fm,1,t5_2qh1m

You wouldnt know which angle it looked best from where to stick the accessories etc.  Designing a box for a vacuum cleaner without seeing the vacuum first would be ridiculous.

8426294,0,t3_4uzpjn,The problems with sku design and why it died I think are for a number of reasons. Phones. Sku designs took an age to load with all variety of assets. People demanded things to load fast whatever their connection. . Rise of frameworks and components. Frameworks allowed you to have a bare bones  yet good looking apps up in no time. Sku was TOO personal to be reusable. . Focus on UX. We became more functional. Which I believe is a good thing. Functional meant more usable which in turn meant more revenue and happy people. . Flat design extends from minimalism and it is less likely to feel dated than sku in the long run. . The death of Flash. Native web suddenly didnt need to feel inferior and try to compete with the design possibilities Flash brought. . Adaptive  responsive design. It is much harder to make a sku website work across the multitude of screen sizes we see today. Flat design fit this task perfectly. Anyone have any thoughts on this?,web_design,d5uttnk,8,t5_2qh1m

Frameworks arent really a good thing and frankly adding unneeded overhead to your sight to get your message across is pretty stupid.  The vast majority of web sights out there today serve the emotional needs of the developer not the customer or user.   Hopefully Pepsis web site will wake people up the world prefers lean and mean.   Oh and web sites that actually work!!!!   I cant even count the number of web sites that are effectively broken on iPad.  Often sites for businesses that should realize that the most important thing isnt a fat web site but rather getting your message across.  gtJust build a normal html page and add some styles to give it a basic look. Ideally this would at least kinda work anywhere from mobile to desktop. Then put styles that only apply for a specific screen width min or max within appropriate media queries Things like a mobile menu that toggles openclosed vs. A desktop menu that has drops downs.K.I.S.S. That is the mantra web developers need to focus on!  When I surf to a web site that bigs down my desktop computer there is something wrong in developer land.  A bad web site will drive me away from a business.   A perfect example of a business with a web site that drives people away is www.newark.com what a load of crap that site is!   ,web_design,d6d3tqp,1,t5_2qh1m

8582801,0,t3_4xchg9,jQuery  A js library that lets you target things in the DOM the living page can only exist in a browser. You target them with CSS selectors and then can perform a plethora of actions like hidingshowing causing click events updating page content retrieving data making network AJAX calls etc. For almost a decade  of the top  sites used all or part of jQuery. It is based on the ideology that interactivity on the web should be very easy and very intuitive. Highly beginner and noncoder friendly.Node.js  This is just JavaScript with IO access. Meaning it can run on its own outside of a browser make network calls the same way desktop apps do without the security limitations of a browser readwriteeditcreatedelete files run executables talk to hardware gimme a list of wifi networks within range how much RAM is currently available and how many CPU cores there are. It was originally marketed as a way to run JavaScript on a server and that is still its primary purpose. It comes with a package manager NPM that lets you pull down premade modules libraries that you can use in your Node based apps. Many many frontend development tools have been made in this format. So even frontend devs who do minimal JS Ruby peeps and dont use Node for anything else will still use it for the tools webpackgulpetc.. Node has also been included in many other arenas of development as well. My personal favorite is NW.js which is a modified version of Chromium with Node built in so you can easily create CrossPlatform desktop applications like Gitter and ScoutApp Node is based on the ideology that their should be one language for both the frontend and the backend and that it should always be fast.Thats all I have time to write on my phone right now.,web_design,d6efp91,1,t5_2qh1m

The fubiz logo has some elements of dlike effects. You can accomplish them in Animate with the D tool and possibly some shape tweens but your output would be limited to video. Animate is now known for its HTML output uses webGL and Canvas mainly to create banner ads. Once they rebranded to Flash to Animate they killed off their other app called Edge Animate which had a GUI that felt much more like AfterEffects than Flash.

9150162,0,t3_55iiu8,Senior UX and frontend dev here. The framework side of this is something I feel very strongly about. I never ever use frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation for work that I do either as a consultant or for my own projects. I simply find them too limiting and I am uncomfortable attaching my name to a project as the designer when I know its primarily using a framework.HOWEVER if youre on a team of more than  people at your job you probably need to use a framework. Not everyone on the team will have the ability to style things quickly from scratch. So its pretty much a necessity to use a framework for consistency. This obviously depends on everyone on the team understanding how to use it and structure it properly...which is also not a given.As for libraries I see no issue with using thirdparty libraries like jQuery at all. But its very important that you dont become overly reliant on them. Use them primarily to augment your project not to fill a gap in your capability.,web_design,d8bul37,1,t5_2qh1m

9194366,0,t3_566ypd,Are you making a table for screen layout or to organize a bunch of rows and columns of data?If youre doing the former you should be using other things for your layout like a div. if youre doing the latter you should be using a table.Tables are not bad by themselves when theyre used for actual tables. The problem is that tables used to be the only way to do page layout and that somehow turned into all tables are bad which is wrong. Now should you be using a table for your data or should you consider a more flow based approach? Thats up to you. But if youre organizing your data into rows and columns for chrissake use a table. ,web_design,d8hgcc9,2,t5_2qh1m

9255003,0,t1_d8ohx84,gt I think Im biting off more than I can chew trying something so hard with no experience.That may be true but dont let anyone discourage you! Just because you dont have the experience or knowledge to develop the site you have in mind doesnt mean you cant design it and here is the crux of the matter by design I dont mean the visual appearance. I mean the information architecture. Remember in grade school having to draw outlines highlighting the hierarchy of major concepts and sections of an essay before you actually began to write it? Get a notebook and start visualizing your site concept like an essay outline or like a family tree or like a food pyramid or some other kind of diagram. Try different layouts. Do it over and over and refine it until you have the structure organized on paper in a way that makes sense to an observer who hasnt heard anything about the idea yet.Remember how the information is organized is the first step determining how it should be presented and finally how you actually build that presentation will be  easier if you start there.    ltunsolicitedadvicegt,web_design,d8p4zkj,2,t5_2qh1m

9315467,0,t3_581g9i,Sounds like the template for that custom content area only wants plain text.Know HTML? May not be the best answer but to get around that....Personally I would download custom fields you can search it in plugins. Plugin is fairly easy to follow but essentially youre creating a text box set it to show up on the Home Page whatever thats called under pages and give it a short code name. This will basically add a second text box into the home page and be assigned to your shortcode ex. customHomeContent .THEN maybe the trickiest part for you you simply need to find the PHP file Appearance gt Editor and replace the code where the template places the content with your shortcode. Generally its going to be a page like homepage.php and filled with a bunch of php statements in this case it will be looking for the content from the customizer probably intro or something. Note once you find that file copy all of its contents before editing paste it into a plain text doc and save it as a backup in case you mess something up  Note  to find where in the .php file your short code needs to be added view the site and inspect element or view page source find your current text you have typed and then look for the class or id name of the section its in.. once you have that you can simply search that in Editor verify it has the same code around it as page source then swap your short code into it. Few other ways around it Im sure but thats what I would do.. good luck  ,web_design,d8wsyjr,2,t5_2qh1m

You can make a logo in illustrator save the .ai file and save a .PNG at say x. Then say you need a larger version of the logo you can go reopen the .ai file make the logo x then save that as a .PNG and there will be no loss of quality. You can also export this .ai file to save it as SVG which is a vector graphic for the web. You cant make a graphic in Photoshop save it as an SVG and have it be scalable because it needs to first be created as a vector.

9426721,0,t1_d9avy77,Agreed. Not ridiculous at all if the market is prepared to pay for it i.e. Theory of Price as it is known in economics.A crappy Mitsubishi Mirage will do the same thing as a Mercedes SL class yet so many people are happy to pay so much more for a Mercedes. You might say the Mercedes has more space or features or ltinsert feature heregt. But you rarely ever use most of those features. Or if you want compare a much cheaper car from the same class as Mercedes SL  same features similar specs different price. Why?Or why does one pizza cost more than the other? Why does McKinsey consulting cost more than Deloittes? The real difference is marketing and positioning. In fact pricing is part of positioning  it communicates to your target market that this product is for them.So if you compare two products or services on price only sure it seems ridiculous to pay more than the absolute minimum for a product or service in the same category. Yet pricing differs because the market is happy to pay more for one over the other  for a variety of reasons.,web_design,d9awh4y,2,t5_2qh1m

9784734,0,t1_dairv2z,I saw your post earlier about maybe having to move if you want a fulltime job. If you need to move for employment and your wife isnt keen on moving then try freelancing first since the alternative is much more of a time and financial gamble but always keep looking for a good fulltime position. Theres a chance you might be really successful and a chance that you wont be but if you keep looking at least theres a fallback plan.I feel like everyone always says that freelancing is hard but it never fully hits someone until they start doing it. Be ready to work a lot of long hard hours while you are wooing your first clients and trying to keep the ones you get. Its not the kind of thing that will lend itself well to having free time so if thats a major concern you are probably better off finding fulltime work. I worked  hours on average as a freelancer many of my fulltime job friends do their  hours they get their holidays and weekends and even with an hour commute they would still have much more free time than I did.,web_design,daj6jum,1,t5_2qh1m

9878976,0,t3_5guy6r,There are different ways to do this. One would be to edit your hosts file so that everytime you enter in the IP address it will redirect you automatically to the mediawiki page. OR you can setup vhosts and give your directory an assigned ipdomain name. Directory root is where you would select the directory of the domainip. This option is a little more complicated and requires some knowledge of apache servers. Just google setting up vhosts with xammp and youll see some starting points.

10430047,0,t3_5pdbp3,You should probably know a bit of JavaScript or at least jquery. But I see a similar trend in my area. I guess the growth of uxui roles has separated the design from the programming side even more and now mostSMEs want someone who can handle the entire customer facing parts of the website. The internet is also the most important medium now and used in so many different ways that tools are constantly being developed and adopted. Feels like Ive been one step behind for the last five years.  Edit it does sound like youre Wordpress focused and there always seems to be jobs for that.

If it is hourly Ill define some milestones so I can collect money along the way. So find some small ways to divide the project so you can send invoices.Sign up for FreshBooks to track time and then you can invoice. I expect they still have a free version if you just accept checks.Have them make the checks to you directly so you dont need another bank account to catch them.Depending on how much youll make some people will send you a  which you have to pay taxes on.Theres a lot here PM me if you need clarification or more help.I have been doing this for a long time.Edit I found more to say,web_design,dev1ryg,79,t5_2qh1m

11151817,0,t1_devu9uu,I would hope that at some point youd be able to map the colours used with like a key value map that could be specified in CSS. Eg maybe a font uses three colours named color color and color. Then stuff like borders might just do some math on those colors like how LESS has a darken function.Then maybe youd have CSS like    body       fontfamily Some color font      color color red color fca color inherit    etc?Or perhaps more simply creators of such fonts could let you pick the colors on their website and generate the font file with those colors set?

11611225,0,t1_dgbdj7u,Yup this. Really easy to do. In your header.php you have a ternary operator for your parameter like this    issetmetatagvariable ? echo ltmeta namedescription content . metatagvariable .gt  Default tag value hereAnd then in your individual page files you set your pagespecific variables before you include the header.php file    metatagvariable  CONTENT    include pathtoheader.php ,web_design,dgc550c,2,t5_2qh1m
11636204,0,t1_dgexbm3,It depends really. If youre aiming for the lowhanging fruit i.e. clients that are so low budget that midsized studios wont market to them then youll find that people there will pay about  which is what freelancers charge them. To get them to pay  or  thousand youll need to make a good business case. These were my main market some  years ago and I pushed k packages on them through showing them how landing sites and fast mobilefriendly sites impact business. I picked clients with high internetdependency say a restaurant that needed tourists or a service that relied on reviews. Then I used success stories as a business case for the next client and so on.If youre aiming for bigger ticket items k k then youll need a kickass portfolio as well as the ability to provide the full solution in my opinion. So you need to have the skills for or partners that will help with all aspects of the development process.,web_design,dgez606,2,t5_2qh1m
11638194,0,t1_dgey0h6,Does the form have CAPTCHA? If not that would help. For the calls set up a google voice number that directs somewhere so if it gets bad you can cancel it. It might be too late for both the email address and number youre currently using though.,web_design,dgf7ao2,1,t5_2qh1m
11643327,0,t3_665l8o,Yes you want to set up a dev server for work just like this. You build on your dev server and once it is approved by the client you migrate the site to their hosting.Judging form the fact that you mention plugins I am going to assume this is a Wordpress site. Use the plugin called Duplicator to migrate the site both times. You may want to try and remove bloat from the current site before you do this.,web_design,dgfs9fm,3,t5_2qh1m
11653568,0,t1_dggxokp,its not something you can have an opinion about mate.

11659909,0,t1_dghns6r,So the way it works is. Each person has a personal queue unique to himher. The room has one or more DJs. Each DJ gets a turn when its hisher turn it plays the track  the top of hisher personal queue for everyone it gets pushed to the track history list.. Then the next DJ goes and so and so forth...I was thinking about adding an on deck feature where you can see the track thats coming up next at the top of the next DJs queue. Would that do what youre expecting?  ,web_design,dghnytb,1,t5_2qh1m
11662875,0,t3_66bdt0,Nice. My only feedback is you should add a swipe feature to change between elements. This can get your beak wet with JSAJAX and gestures.,web_design,dgi02r3,1,t5_2qh1m
