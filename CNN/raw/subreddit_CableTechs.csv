6767322,0,t3_47tak2,Ive been doing installer work for over  years now and I crawl a house around once a week. In my area its fairly  on the house being good or bad to crawl. The thing I hate most are camel crickets and I dont see them often. When I do I just focus on crawling and getting it done with. The fewer trips under the better. ,CableTechs,d0jctl2,1,t5_2wfj8
