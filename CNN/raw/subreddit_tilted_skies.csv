5965134,0,t1_cy1a8f4,I like writing novelization for fun but I am going to probably start doing just dialogue and adding ideas for the visual part of the comic. Read my other post for the dresden thing and I understand your fear.I wrote this piece when I was exhausted. I didnt mention daisy because it was obvious how she died. This is more throwaway fun piece.I am in a lot of pain and nausea right now so if I missed something l apologize. Criticism is good I wouldnt do art or write if I couldnt take it.I was thinking about doing a master post like I did over in  but with different arcs. Im going to finish the time line figure out the arcs and then go back and do very precise outlines with all the dialogue and visual notes included so that I can blaze through it when it comes to artAlso I may occasionally wrote things that are never going to be included in the comic its just a part of the world building,tilted_skies,cy1k6ey,2,t5_2vcks
