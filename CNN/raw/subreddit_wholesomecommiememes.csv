The only people that have that kind of money the ultra rich didnt earn it the workers who made the products or delivered the services did. Theyve proven that theyd rather buy their third yacht than help out the poors.Communism a stateless moneyless society would solve this byMaking it so as a whole society we address problems based on what people need. Not what the ultra wealthy are but usually arent willing to sacrifice out of their spare change each year.,wholesomecommiememes,dfw6p9p,1,t5_3jey0
