9401151,0,t1_d970an0,Thanks for your response. I was unaware of the city  vote on question . That alone turns me to a NO vote thanks for the info. I am interested in question . Thats been a tough one I appear to share viewpoints with you. I was unaware of the donors and need to do more research on that.Question  I lean YES. But I am a bit afraid it will be a burden on the poor. Still Im pretty prosmall business I have a Republican leaning being antioverregulation. Yet I somehow feel that our current food supply issues have become ridiculous. Im a lbs man and I still think the over consumption of meat is insane. I LOVE eating meat. But damn...we are worried about the poor...our poor have an obesity problem in this country! Anyways Ill not rant.I also strongly support . I think the reefer madness hysteria ads are a joke. I also think they are pushing this state troopers death for their cause and I see that as wrong. Funny I have never once seen government and these groups champion bringing back prohibition when there is a drunk driving death. But that is all not the issue. The points you made are much more legitimate.. I think your videos are excellent. I dont agree with every one but who could possibly agree on everything? My point is when you make you views easily accessible with straight talk and its freely and easily available online...THAT is the future of politics in my opinion and I am happy to see candidates doing it. I wish you luck in your race.,SouthCoast,d97ntys,1,t5_2s5ft
