I think that enabling player made quests would help a bit  the community has stepped up to do some of this but without the proper tools they are doing the best they can with what they have.And I think that is what most people miss about this game. Yes many people have expectations of Ultimas  in terms of singleplayer. But to many this game is about community.

9815724,0,t1_dam5nwt,Here you go Each is about an hour long with the first two being from the same release  months ago.Video Review Part  Ramp the volume up on that one sorry.Video Review Part Video Review Part  this is the Release  oneIf you do get the time to watch youll see that the graphics have improved as you mention crafting used to be even worse and at least now its just a very slow timer at low levels combat was laughable but has improved a bit but path finding has been tweaked a bit... yet is just as ridiculous as ever. Mobs can now at least fall off vertical slopes but they cant path find back up them so they still teleport instantly back to their starting position when they give up fighting.And yet they also manage to break basic looting third video  minutes in is where I go through looting corpses and illustrate the three issues that have turned up with it. Some sheep are completely unlootable one of the chickens is too close to but still a foot off a wall and the game wont let you move to loot it and the others often have corpses nowhere near their body so I have to waggle around the cursor looking to see where it lights up.I can narrow down the performance issue a bit as I was on an aging system for parts  and  but upgraded to a high end pc between then and the third. It could also be ram loading  clearing as Im only running gp although pretty quick ram but I see it most when Im in populated areas even if Im stood still so I suspect its net syncing. Its in Part  that I mostly and honestly total up the cost of all the homes and items I can see. The game wasnt persistent then. Theyve had another  months of demanding money and the game has gone persistent since then its an absolutely awful feeling now as virtually nothing you can see came into the game via the in game mechanisms. At one point in Part  I stop to cross check an airship and realise theyve even started doing Limited Edition runs to raise money. It honestly is  for that home alone. I then do a quick montage of all the store pages at that present time and theres fourteen of them...How long before its fixed? It depends how long a smaller and smaller community can afford to keep their hopes alive. The previous Telethon raised  but that was from only  people.

10075381,0,t1_dbi6oq1,Something I would say to this is Star Citizen is at least fun and they havent added in all the core features like miningsalvagingtrading. The combat is fun and doesnt rely on hidden numbers to say if you hit. The other thing is they are more honest in the feedback area. They take the feedback and look at it not brush it off and say no its this way. They look at the bad reviews and see how to make them better.Star Citizen does have a real problem of feature creep and that is what I see as causing a lot of the delays. Problem is no real feature creep is to blame is SotA as they didnt add new features since POT really. And that to me was a waste. Cause now we will have all these empty POT that are nothing but storage space. Yes roleplayers will use them and redo them all the time for different looks and feels. But doesnt add to the core game anyone can enjoy as they locked off sellingbuying in game the POT. Yes we dont know what the costs and how long it will take to get up to a capital ship in SC but that is an option. Here we dont have that option unless someone sells their POT for in game gold which i dont see happening.,shroudoftheavatar,dbkudqy,2,t5_2wj9k
10134947,0,t1_dbshexa,Rust you can run your own server you can disable the PvP aspect. Most join servers of the type they like. Looking at the servers most dont have a large population count. Just like minecraft servers back when people got those going people will join a server that fits what they want. PvP in minecraft use to be a thing and then groups like goon squad showed up to those open servers and killed it because they just killed for the fun of ruining other peoples games.Albion is doing it based on zone color. So your only full loot drop in the red zones. Also you will not be in full time PvP as its flagging system or in certain zones its all PvP.Nobody wants it in a MMO type system and I stand by my words. If they did want it then the whole issue with TrammelFelucca wouldnt be an issue and Felucca would have had a lot of people running around it. As was very few went to Felucca and if you did go you almost never ran into anyone. Rust is not a single world its using minecraft type servers where they can mod them and put in custom rulesets Albion is using zones and people can pick not to go to zones with full loot and I think a lot of those full loot zones will not be traveled by many people just like in EvE null sec free people wont travel it. Large groups will form to protect it and boom you end up with another game where it isnt about how you play but those with the most people win gangs rule.,shroudoftheavatar,dbsl6fl,2,t5_2wj9k

10509557,0,t3_5qh9b9,Hey JC glad to see you here. This sub is very negative towards the game for the most part... and much of the negativity is actually warranted. The forums tend to be more positive but they moderate quite heavily from what Ive heard.SotA could have been a great game I was hyped back when it was called Ultimate RPG but Ive lost hope for it. If you want to socialize in a fantasy setting and show off the pixel crack you purchased for real money then it may have some appeal for you. But if you want a game that was built from the ground up to be engaging and fun ... or if you want a high quality single playercoop storytelling experience ... well it may be best to keep looking.Portalarium knows where their money is coming from and pretty much cater the entire game to those folks now. Problem is that a lot of the initial money they raised were for other expectations.Its practically released at this point and that has been an ongoing point of contention.Theres a LOT of nasty drama in the community. Name calling and childish behavior on both sides. Claims of doxxing. Some buyers feel ripped off and wont let it go. Others are big monetary supporters and will say anything to defend their investment.I tend to point folks towards Shards Online if they are looking for a UO successor. Better team better community.,shroudoftheavatar,dczdboh,12,t5_2wj9k
10515519,0,t1_dcz52z3,Let me clarify. Here is my paragraph.gtI enjoyed pretrammel in UO where I could die at any time any place but that was over  years ago. Meaning I was in the minority of players who liked risk vs reward to the point where I could be ganked and have all my stuff looted from me. But that was a long time ago. This was  and things were different. Everything was pretty much in experiment stages.gtGaming has evolved. UO also didnt exactly have a lot of players and one reason was because of that.WOW really changed the scene on things among other games. But the large crowds of WOW evolved gaming into something very different than UO. UO only had floated around  players at the time before trammel. Which was quite large for the time in fact the quickest gain EA had up to that point but EQ had much more DAoC had even more and after trammel there was a huge increase. One reason UO didnt have a lot of players is because it was much more dangerous than other games. Some people didnt like being killed and being looted of everything. While  was a lot for that time just a year later EQ had triple the number. So UO could have had more.gtWhen trammel came out subs reached their peak. I was wrong to say this. The truth of the matter is subs fluctuated. It looks like they gained players until around the middle of  over a year after trammel came out and then it lost players until Lord Blackthorns Revenge then had a bump then lost more until Age of Shadows where they peaked and finally after that they lost more and more players until around  in . Depending on who what and where you read this information it all slightly differs. Trammel gave it a large boost but it was short lived. By  you had EQ and Dark Age of Camelot draining players.One graph shows trammel having  players and Age of Shadows having .Im not sure how I made it sound like subs started to decline by saying gtWhen trammel came out subs reached their peak. To me that sounds like... when it came out subs increased. Reaching a peak as in going up. While it was increasing already it gained almost  players  months after trammel as opposed to gaining only  the six months prior. Not to be rude and that isnt my intention to be. Please correct me if I am wrong on anything. And sorry if I led anyone with thinking falsely about something.All numbers shouldnt be taken for fact either. Some numbers are just estimates and guessing by people who have devoted more than the few minutes I looked into it. I played UO from ish so I only saw increases. By the time ninjas came out I was done.,shroudoftheavatar,dd01p1o,1,t5_2wj9k

They are using PvP to shortcut development as in their heads I think this is going on Players can PvP and get hours of enjoyment out of it even if they dont want to PvP cause then they will have to grind for hours to even try and then loss gear to the PvPer and have to grind more hours to replace gear YEA thats what we want to do.  How the hell does one even think this is a viable business model? Loss of items that take hours or days to make does not make the game fun in any more way then if I have a tank I can just roll down the street without worrying about traffic or lights or anything I just go because I can crush anything that gets in my way. I think these devs are trying to relive childhood where they got bullied and now they can bully other people. Yes you can have things like a stronger person in a story beat you down and take your stuff cause that drives the story but to do it in a multiplayer game is just stupid. They have no risk when your overpowered against new people or weekend players. That is were  of your player base comes from weekend players who cant spend  hours a week playing your game. The people that spend  hours a week end up leaving your game for the next thing and dont care. Now your saying PvP is required which goes against EVERYTHING you said before. But if you really felt that this was your end goal why didnt you kickstart this as a PvP game? No uPortalarium you said it was a single player with multiplayer options. Now you have done a  and said PvP is required. I want a full refund this isnt anywhere close to what you said. You said in depth story the story has no depth and you have made it clear it wont have any depth. Your whole company is trying to milk your past works to make it look like your still popular but notice you have next to no positive support except where you can control the message.

Sorry that you are leaving.Yes its funny that rares are little r rare in SotA.  I dont know how long it will take for the first epic Warlocks Chain to be sold  but I can already see a lot of trading around it.  For a lot of things marketrelated I am often a little disappointed in SotA. With a lower population ingame the economy doesnt appear to function very efficiently.  For rares in R the price skyrocketed even to for example k gold and then collapsed by the end of R down to around k gold and those price levels still hold in R.  This time there are so many R rares recipes and patterns that I dont see any price levels establishing themselves.,shroudoftheavatar,de98a90,3,t5_2wj9k

11269497,0,t1_df9cjgs,The difference is EvE has a very different econ and very different game play. Also when EvE first started out we had suicide alts to get free ships and stored them at stations equ with better weapons so we have things ready to go on junk ships but great for suicide runs. You had a very different style of systems in place. Here you have none of that. I can in eve go out and mine without fighting hard things and get most of what I need. If I cant get it I can sell what I can get and buy the things for chea. I can stay in high sec and never fight anything but still go out and mine. Here you have to fight in order to mine ANYTHING. Every resource node has  mobs in agro range.They are trying to drive RMT in game which makes it feel more like a FP game then a BP game. If I buy a game I dont want to have  items on a item store. I want those items in game as a way to make them or earn them via raids or whatever. People will say they are just cosmetic things but the thing is Cosmetic items for sale should only be on youyour mountpetwhatever not the house you buy or outhouse or whatever. And the other thing is the cosmetic things can be stolen or lost if its an item. But this gets into the fake econ that they are running in game. People sell gold for real money and they are tracking the cost of COTO and wont raise the in game drop rate till it goes over a set amount of trades and gold amount. So they are not letting the market adjust itself they are making it fit how they want to view it.,shroudoftheavatar,df9dpux,1,t5_2wj9k
