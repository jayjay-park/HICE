416821,0,t1_cfnyfu7,Its a rumor I heard at work today but I couldnt find anything in the news mentioning that is exactly what they did. Only that the charge is for both of them at the same place.Edit Here is a video on WBTW. She mentions she cant speak on the indecent exposure charges so take what I heard today and purely rumor and might those charges might not be connected at all. ,MyrtleBeach,cfnywqc,2,t5_2s77w

That usually doesnt include the cost of electricity cable or internet. However water is usually included with the rent. Its very busy in the summer. Theres a lot to do and the beaches will be very crowded. The weather is sunny most days but it can get very hot and humid.
