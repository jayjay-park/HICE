2012832,0,t3_2hsxun,Heres my advice Like others have said theres plenty of mediocre content on youtube. Theres also plenty of great content. So you not only need to have your production values video quality sound quality editing and pacing be up to snuff but you also need something that makes you different. The production values side of things isnt actually too hard its just a little time consuming and takes some initial learning learning to use a video editor learn to at least eq your sound maybe throw a deesser and whatnot a little work on the audio can make it sound much more polished pretty easilyThe uniqueness factor is a little trickier. Are you going for a funny route? Will you be super indepth about your analyses from the get go? Are you just a damn skillful gamer? Extremely thorough er collectibles fiend? Speedy players just smashing through the game as fast as possible? Maybe youll hold yourself to certain additional rules to keep it interesting a la Robbazs unarmed Skyrim playthrough. This is what you should consider. Hope any of this helps!,shadowofmordor,ckvqrgs,1,t5_2z2su

2064689,0,t3_2ihkfv,I totally agree. I was pretty underwhelmed with everything about the story. I didnt expect much so I wasnt bothered with how easy and boring almost every single story mission was most of them feel like tutorials to warm you up for playing around with the nemesis system anyway but I was at least expecting a fight at the end. The fight with the five strong guys you do with everybody youve branded was cool and it got me really pumped for...the Tower the least challenging boss encounter  Ive ever played in a game and then the final confrontation was a cutscene with quick time events? I get the way they dramatized it and thats fine but it felt really anticlimactic. Talions character is wholly motivated by his desire for revenge and his wish to die and having that conflict erupt in a short cutscene really severs my already tenuous connection with that character.It really bummed me out because the emotional stuff with Talion at the end is by far the best story moment in the game but he was so bland and the story was given so little focus the whole time that I didnt really care. And having the revenge robbed from me from a gameplay perspective too was just another blow to my caring for anything that happened. A lot happens right there at the end and it could have been cool if wed gotten to know those characters better or had a little more insight into why they made those decisions. I feel like the whole story was a missed opportunity. Ultimately its not that big of a deal. The things that are appealing about that game arent the story and I have a blast when Im playing but theres a glimpse of something interesting there at the end that makes me wish theyd put a little more time or effort or whatever into the narrative too.,shadowofmordor,cl29mt3,2,t5_2z2su

2071443,0,t1_cl346x3,I dont remember reading that but it sounds consistent with the storming of Celebrimbors home and the slaying of his wife and child.I think what was trying to be addressed here was the source of powers not displayed by other wraiths. The ability to resurrect a dead human and impart power on them and the ability to brand an enemy making them your follower.I believe the follower part is answered by the  leaders of men being great leaders as simply being able to brand their own followers. The healing and preservation was a part of the  rings Celebrimbor made without Saurons guidance. If as you say you must put a part of your power into a creation in middleearth then that would explain Celebrimbors ability to snag Talions soul and resurrect his body countless times.Making Celebrimbor seem much stronger than the other wraiths.,shadowofmordor,cl34jnf,0,t5_2z2su

This forces you to pay much more attention in combat as the game isnt telling you what buttons to press. Archers become a big hassle because you dont know theyre there unless theyre firing at you. I wish more powerful captains would spawn in.

Some of them are pretty useless and some of them can actually pose a threat to Talion.

Planning ahead is much more important. Coming up with a strategy to get to all the orcs is crucial when you only have  minutes to kill each orc. Also playing for maximum score is a little different because you cant just rely on mowing down hordes of warriors in an alarmed stronghold. You have to find groups of the higher point berserkers defenders and hunters and go after them.Once youve got the combat down in the game the Tests of Combat are a good challenge.

When I had him nearly dead I made the mistake of using him for a death threat. I had never done one before and didnt realize it meant he got to live. Duh right? So I got to do it all over again.

I am assuming that you are currently in the part of the main mission where you have to kill  warchiefs. After you have done this quest there are a few more as well as a boss fight shortly after which you can travel to the new area. Essentially what you have to do is kill the warchiefs the quests for them should be marked yellow and then do the other yellow quests that appear. So essentially just do the main yellow missions. That should be enough. Once in the new area keep doing the yellow missions until the game tells you that you have branding. ,shadowofmordor,cnnsqpr,1,t5_2z2su

Do your best to get the toughest orcs to level  get the prized orcs to Warchief fast forward time some more until they get plenty of bodyguards and start challenging them.  Oh and let them kill you once so when you get them you get a revenge bonus for a chance of a better rune.

You seem to know your Middle Earth lore.Did Talion actually die though? his main conflictstruggle is that hes been denied death not that he died and was brought back to the world of the living. I think in general they would be closer to a Barrow Wight than a wraith since theyre specifically described to pierce the mind and break the wills of others.While ou bring up many good points on how SoM doesnt follow ME lore I think the best way to describe it would be authentic but inaccurate. I think they capture the tone of Tolkiens work quite well but they go other places with it. My problem is those places they go to are not explored enough to make for a substantial engaging narrative but I think this path could prove to be an interesting one if they go even further with the idea of making authentic yet different works in Tolkiens universe.,shadowofmordor,cynxu9z,1,t5_2z2su

The answer to this was that they were Haradrim....obviously that makes no sense because Tolkien himself based the Harad off of the Middle East. The Movies followed Tolkiens vision and cast Middle eastern looking people for the Harad. So it really makes no sense how a black dude represents the Harad.Even if the Harad were black it still makes no sense for one of them to be accepted into the Gondorian defense or even given any sort of power within the Dunedain command considering the history between the two people. ,shadowofmordor,degqn3n,7,t5_2z2su

Captains with this trait are not damaged by any projectile they can still be staggered. This doesnt mean Explosive is deemed useless  it is still one of the deadliest traits a Captain can have.Among a few other important traits any grab attack they possess is very important as these increase the chance of instantly killing an Uruk.
