1164638,0,t1_ci0hh3o,Dont feed icebergit has no nutritional value for the animal. Romaine is ok I also frequently feed chicory collard turnip and dandelion greens. Fruits like apple and pear can be given semiregularly and they seem to really love it. They absolutely love bananas but theyre unhealthy for themgive them sparingly.Also they really dig Mazuri tortoise diet. Most large pet stores will have it though its cheaper from exotic pet stores. Soak the pellets in water and they eat it right up. You should never feed any other types of pelleted food.Remember variety is key! Change up what youre feeding and be sure to give them occasional animal protein. I usually give a bit of unspiced chicken turkey or salmon every week or so. Cooked eggs are ok for them but can sometimes make their stomachs upset.Also remember tortoises especially of this size dont need a ton of food if they arent being kept outside. If theyre kept indoors they dont get a lot of exercise and can get fat. Your tortoise might just not be hungry. When you feed him only feed him what he can eat in fifteen minutestake his food away after that. Or you can try feeding him every other day.,tortoise,ci0n39d,2,t5_2sd1c

Im often told that plain top soil and coconut coir mixed is the best substrate with the right combination of comfort and function..Even if its not too often of a thing it will have to happen occasionally and making it difficult to do means it will happen even less.

If not then a Hermanns tortoise. The photos will make it clear. Feel free to check the hind legs for spurs but they dont always stand out.

5816966,0,t1_cxh36f5,Agreed this is a Slider and most likely a Yellow Belly unless it has red on its ears. Kinda looks female but the angles are not great for me to be  sure.Dont put in water just covering its back at room temp to help wake it up slowly and so it wont drown. Once its lively again and seems strong it can go into a proper enclosure. Its either very obese or could have an infection in the front end. Can I see a photo of the front from a side angle please. Thatll help me tell if it is infected or not. If you can also get photos of the turtles head and neck that would be great for a proper ID and to see if the skin there is just obese or infected. ,tortoise,cxi5dj2,1,t5_2sd1c

7930117,0,t1_d479ksk,Heres a care sheet written up by people who have raised Greek or Spurthigh tortoises for years. Its a lot of reading but its very very good information.   This will tell you what type of lighting heating humidity and over all habitat your tortoise needs and what kinds of foods you can give it. If youre going the route of using a plastic box for your tortoise heres a good idea of what size you should use and some ideas for light substrate placement. Its going to be very overwhelming in the beginning so dont freak out. Youll be learning a lot about your tortoise and how to take good care of it over the next few months and even years. For now work on getting it proper heating and proper substrate. Then work on making a very good house for it and giving it a good diet. Also make sure you give it a cuttelfish bone and a shallow dish of water along with everything else. ,tortoise,d47f4jk,3,t5_2sd1c
7992696,0,t1_d4ecfp9,It might help to tell them that since its a wild turtle it wont respond to being fed turtle pellets or other commonly available foods.  Its used to hunting and foraging and even if you could get him to start eating that type of stuff the drastic change in diet could have negative consequences for him healthwise even kill  him.  Also caring for water turtles quickly becomes a big expensive affair they need a large tank or pond and an even bigger land area  their water gets nasty really fast even with good filters and such.  and they can eat a LOT.Convince them to rescue a tortoise instead theyre easier to care for and are imo quite friendly compared to most water turtles.  ,tortoise,d4egdxq,1,t5_2sd1c

9898898,0,t3_5h2s2e,My Russian was exactly like that lethargic because of the temperature. What I did was invest in a ceramic heater and leave it on . At night when the UV light turns off the ceramic heater is still on and at the very least allows the Russian to warm itself up if it gets too cold one part of the enclosure has a minimum of F degrees. Im not a big fan of hibernation as thats kind of advanced for most owners and it doesnt really affect a russian tortoise whether it hibernates or not. TLDR its cold and that is causing it to be lethargic. Just have a source of heat for him  and hell be active again. ,tortoise,daxuldq,0,t5_2sd1c

10210407,0,t3_5m73mu,Yes but you may need to use a different cue than just saying Here boy!Tortoises dont have the best hearing but they pick up on low frequency soundsvibrations more easily. My suggestion would be to pick a sound possibly a ten second sound clip thats bassheavy and start playing that whenever you feed your tortoise or give it treats. Theyll make the association pretty quickly and come towards you when the sound is played. ,tortoise,dc1ense,5,t5_2sd1c
10959186,0,t3_5wfqs4,I actually think he is just cold. If you hung a heat lamp and made a hot spot for him my guess is he would spend most of his time there.  Tortoises are weird because they soak in heat. So even though its warm in your place  hes literally on a quest to find the sun patch.  Hope this helps.,tortoise,dead1ud,2,t5_2sd1c
10982354,0,t1_decf1fj,I liked much your answer and I upvoted it. Finally I got a solid reply on why are tortoises are kept more like mammals. I will try to reply in each paragraph.When I was saying mammals I meant more the general notion of mammalian pet not anything in particular. They are kept how to explain it in more space as I said more free and with less temphumidity controls than other reptiles. Sometimes while you see them outdoors I have never seen tortoises kept you have the impression they are warm blooded or at least belong in a different class of their own outside reptiles or mammals. Livestock arent only animals which produce arent horses livestock as well? I would compare large tortoises to cold blooded livestock and smaller ones to rabbits guinea pigs even chickens in the case of omnivorous red foots etc.I dont know but I would be uncomfortable to equate them with fish. They are more intelligent and you can interact with them more eg by giving food they follow you etc. More like ducks maybe or like some mammals. Some mammals are too small to be picked up safely and others are strict ground dwellers and get stressed like tortoises. Rabbits for example hate being picked up. My rabbit dislikes that too much and she will avoid me for some time if I pick her up unprepared. I call her turtle for that reason. Probably every grounddwelling animal that feels uncomfortably when climbing dislikes being picked up.Stimulation is good for any organism and it has been found that it increases the brain size and connections of even fish and invertebrates. However animals can live in captivity without much stimulation and less intelligent species dont care much about it. Many people keep their reptiles in simple setups. I although not using extremely simple setups lean towards the simple side for ease of maintenance.Some reptiles that can surpass them in intelligence are monitors tegus crocodilians etc. These can surpass many small mammals as well. Monitor lizards are wide roaming quite intelligent carnivores and yet people keep them in small enclosures with little stimulation.Eating a bit of of meat does not disqualify something as a herbivore. Iguanas and uromastix can also eat some animal protein if they need it. Cows sheep deer etc are known to eat nestling birds and other small defenseless animals if they happen upon them. And to tell my own anecdote my rabbit eats waxworms crickets grasshoppers and phoenix worms. If I let it i will run and gobble up any waxworm it finds. But still it is a herbivore.And last but most important I recognize what you want to say. I have read it from many tortoise websites and keepers and forums. Tortoises are difficult to keep indoors because of problems with abnormal growth and uvb lighting. However animals from much more exposed to the sun places like uromastix and bearded dragons are kept and bred inside just fine and also humid hides can be provided indoors for a milder microclimate. Do tortoises have something special or magical that cannot be fulfilled in that conditions?,tortoise,dectcwn,1,t5_2sd1c
