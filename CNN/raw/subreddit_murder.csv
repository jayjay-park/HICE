7142186,0,t3_4d5lnv,Hi uMiltonabbit!This is a subreddit for a different kind of murder and as such Ive removed your post.  You might find rcrime rTrueCrimeDiscussion or rAllCrime more appropriate or possibly a general newsoriented subreddit like rnews or a localarea subreddit.Thanks!,murder,d1pzo3u,1,t5_2r37k
