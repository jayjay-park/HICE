52838,0,t3_1uplpi,Well I have watched kids before but never nannied.  I agreed to occasional laundry and cleaning up after the kids meals toys etc.  It was never said whos laundry I would be doing but I recently get the idea that its not very common for nannies to do everyones laundry.  We dont have a contract.  I live near Chapel hill North Carolina.  ,Nannies,cekg230,1,t5_2tscr
416678,0,t1_cfn1rxm,I am posting this to the top comment for visibility. First off I would like to thank you all for your concern and help. I spoke with my friend whos mother runs an at home daycare and has dealt with similar situations. She advised to take pictures of everything I may find wrong and record anything that may seem off. I will turn this all in anonymously. This will not only help E but will also save me from being reported if her day care is making any notes on these things. Im hoping this all just works out for the best. ,Nannies,cfnydhn,4,t5_2tscr
1207539,0,t1_chz9i66,I had a  year old one summer and someone made me a mixed CD with a Glee version of Dont Stand So Close to Me. I found it very catchy as did the child. I found it particularly hilarious when he memorized the words and sang them on the playground while going down the slide. I had no idea though that he sang it at home until years later I was talking to his uncle and the song came up and he goes !!! We wondered where he learned that song! He sang it all the time. In my defense his mother lets him listen to lady gaga and the like. Hes currently . ,Nannies,ci5gt19,1,t5_2tscr
1524943,0,t1_cj7cq54,Kynanny is right on with this. Giving the children an opportunity to discuss better choices and helping them understand that they have other options is so important as they learn impulse control. Two other suggestions remember not to give any attention good or bad for the fighting. If it is so out of hand that it has to be stopped firmly but quietly state that their behavior is unacceptable and they need to go to time outoutsidewherever you want to send them and then walk away. Once the anger has passed then talk to them about what better choices could be made next time. Do not engage in any conversation about who did what or whos to blame. Lastly Ive read a lot about dealing with sibling fights and the consensus seems to be let it go. This is how kids learn to understand their power and their limits. They learn in a safe home environment what happens if they cross certain lines. Its better to have a sibling hit them back than you lecture them. That hit well resonate longer and make more of an impact. Its also safer for them to learn these boundaries at home rather than with stranger kids. I try to leave the room when the fighting starts bc if they know I see hitting and dont say anything they think its ok. But if I go to another room or send them outside I can monitor the fight without engaging them or having then think I know about it. Let them learn these lessons now while theyre young and while theyre with a sibling someone who will always be there and love them after the fighting is over. ,Nannies,cj7ffuo,1,t5_2tscr
1563062,0,t3_2c43uz,Like others have said if its an interaction with someone we wont see again I let it slide. If well be seeing then again I correct gently like thanks but Im their nanny or oh thanks for the tip Ill pass it on to the parents. I have trouble responding when I get Oh I thought they were yours!? Youre so good with them! I dont know how to answer well yeah Im good at my job sounds rude. ,Nannies,cjc7axk,2,t5_2tscr

1946526,0,t1_ckn8n7a,I would like to make a big note of Natural Consequences. A natural consequence for riding your bike in the street would be that a car pulls up and cannot get around or sadly a car hits you. I would either play in the street with the child and help the child to keep alert for cars coming or warn the child when I see a car coming and teach the child how to move his bike to the side let the car pass and continue. Now while playing in the street in not ideal and can be dangerous this is where nanny comes in to help guide the child and keep a watchful eye. I would not recommend this on a busy street or a street with a high speed limit. In my nanny neighborhood kids play in the street all the time and we are on a culdasac so cars usually expect it. Or second options set a boundary and NO playing in street. A natural consequence is something that will naturally happen not a punishment or something you implement.,Nannies,cknrbj3,0,t5_2tscr
1949503,0,t3_2gy4y9,I really think that we choose our own plight and that we should not let the mean people in our pasts determine our futures.  The things that happened to you with your family are your business and those are not things that you need to share with your employers.  I think its important for everyone to be cognizant of how our pasts can influence our future choices... There are a TON of things about my past and childhood that I hope to never bring with me to my future family or any of the families I work for so I try to really think about it.  And thinking about that helps me to avoid these things.  I am sure that if you really analyze yourself and possibly even get therapy you will be totally fine.  I dont have an abusive background but I have a dysfunctional background and I know that therapy has really helped me break that cycle! I am sure that once your employers get to know more about you and your past they will not care in the slightest because they have already been able to form their own opinions.,Nannies,cko4a3i,2,t5_2tscr

2365604,0,t1_cm3v946,Alright thanks. If I end up getting an interview I suppose I can bring it up then and ask if its something theyd be interested in to bring the cost down.,Nannies,cm43j89,1,t5_2tscr

3349061,0,t3_2ygrqf,Daww. The I love you comments are the best. This week I was supposed to work TThurs but I got a text on Saturday from MB asking if Id switch to WF because Little Scientist and Little Princess have Friday off and have been begging to go to the science museum with me. Apparently it must be with me not MB or DB.  Appreciation from the kiddos makes the job worth it all!,Nannies,cpa0o2j,1,t5_2tscr
3406626,0,t1_cp7db78,Ugh.  I hate attachment parenting.  There is nothing wrong with some of the things in moderation like wearing baby while out.  However full attachment parenting is so horrible in my opinion.I also dont understand people who wont let their kids eat things like pretzels or Ritz crackers.  Yes. some ingredients arent the best for you... but everything in moderation is fine.  Dont let your kid eat thirty Ritz crackers for lunch.  Let them eat a couple along with fruits etc. for a nice balanced meal.  I just dont understand some people...,Nannies,cpgkwl4,2,t5_2tscr
3614402,0,t1_cq3d11k,Whaaaat. I cant believe some people do that. Someone I worked for over the summer wanted me to feed the kids hot dogs chips and chicken nuggets every day. It was kinda gross. I tried to cook as much as I could.,Nannies,cq49ni6,2,t5_2tscr
3639621,0,t1_cq6mvla,I love this idea! Weve been going places and getting home about  minutes after mom and dad latelynot required to text where we will be they are very chill about it so I may have to try this? ,Nannies,cq75772,3,t5_2tscr

4861334,0,t1_cu79jrq,Yea I cant come in and actually reraise the children... I can only reinforce what has only been enforced at least that how I feel. These children have an attitude of oh its ok to have dirty dishes everywhere... its ok to keep my clothes here abd not there... i dont have to do things I dont want to do.....  If the dad wants things clean he needs to teach them a new attitude thats going to be impossible for me. I tell them to clean up the crumbs from the sandwich you just ate and they just tell me that the family usually does all the cleaning at the end of the day. .. yet dad comes home and yells???,Nannies,cu7b3cj,3,t5_2tscr
4946306,0,t1_cuhswh0,I think a raise andor a cut in responsibility would be reasonable. It would be unreasonable to expect you to take on an extra child AND continue the house work for the same rate. I just found out momboss is pregnant and is planning to have grandma watch the new baby while i watch Goober who will be  when baby comes. I dont see that working out how she plans so Id love to hear how this works out for you.,Nannies,cui0sp6,4,t5_2tscr
