In my opinion its better to learn on something slower and work your way up master the  before you get a .While the Ninja  isnt fast at all by motorcycle standards you wont have any trouble keeping up with traffic.  From a bit of searching it seems to have no trouble cruising at mph and will top out around mph.Have you budgeted for a fullfaced helmet jacket and gloves?

7296505,0,t1_d23xnuj,Sorry I missed your reply! So I test drove a Vulcan  and a Suzuki Boulevard . Im leaning toward getting a midsize cruiser now and then upgrading in the next few years. Aside from acceleration the two bikes seemed very similar as far as handling and comfort go. Ill spend a bit less now and then when the time comes be ready for a bigger one that I can keep for years to come. Thanks for your help! ,SuggestAMotorcycle,d27ka0m,2,t5_35x56
10093672,0,t1_dbn6ihx,Damn thats a pretty bike. Only problem is bikes over cc are quite difficult to get over here Mexico and the ones that are for sale can be quite expensive. Ill check some other options and probably make a thread once I decide on two or three. Ill mainly use it in the city to go to work and school basically. Maybe travel a once every few months but nothing too crazy. ,SuggestAMotorcycle,dbn7yzu,1,t5_35x56

10439043,0,t1_dcrbpju,Trashy stuff tends to break a lot and there is a lot of shit that breaks on scooters. In my experience they charge  per hour around Munich for repairs not including the price for the stuff they actually fixed. If you let them repair it a  scooter can quickly turn into  while still keeping its shitty condition.If you are willing to learn and get your hands dirty or have friends that can do that older scooters or Chinese ones could be worth it. However if it comes down to replacing parts it will become a lot more difficult.I bought a Kymco Super  from  in Munich with about km. Had a few issues because the owner left it standing for ages but they were quick repairs. I think they go around  or so though.,SuggestAMotorcycle,dcrc9ir,1,t5_35x56

They were sold in the US between  so if you want anything performance its custom NOS or used.  eBay is your friend and if you want to build it up youll need to learn who JD Hord is.,SuggestAMotorcycle,dcwni71,1,t5_35x56
10668362,0,t1_ddgc7wr,I was looking at an  Savage  that I was offered but I heard mixed reviews about them so I was hesitant. Ill also look at the nonsuper sports but some people have told me to stay away from anything about cc because they would be too powerful for a beginner. ,SuggestAMotorcycle,ddgczqq,1,t5_35x56
10972826,0,t1_debqzd6,Buying used Harleys if fun and funny. For one if you like the nighster dont only look at nighsters people customize sportsters heavily and the model name only gives you an idea of what the bike looks like the black out can be done to any of the trims. Do you have a particular year range you are looking at? The wiki page for sportsters has a year by year break down of whats changed and outside of a few major years little is actually updated. And a k nighster will probably sell for  as its common for people to over value them on CL by easily k dont be surprised to make an offer and get told no only to have them message back in a month asking if the offer still stands. In my area on the offseason there are s for sale for  so theres no way a  is worth more than  if you can word that and the fact that you wont pay for their upgrades they generally see reason. ,SuggestAMotorcycle,debrtd7,1,t5_35x56
11152630,0,t3_5z5dpx,Ive never ridden the triumph before but of the other  i would go with a VStrom  hands down. KLR is as mentioned way more dirt oriented plus any highway time is less than pleasant because of that single cylinder rocking away between your legs. I owned a  VStrom  for a while and i can honestly say it was the best bike Ive owned so far and probably also my favorite of all Ive ridden too. Very smooth decently quick plenty of power fairly easy maintenance handles great on road and definitely can hold its own off road extreeemely comfortable  even with a bad back and surprisingly good wind protection. Plus if youre gonna do distance theres loads of options for luggage and other accessories. Only downside i can think of is the height if youre vertically challenged you should definitely size one up and weigh in your comfort with tip toeing while stopped. Being  this was not an issue for me.God i miss that bike.P.s. i also live in NY on long island and it handled potholes very well,SuggestAMotorcycle,dew506z,2,t5_35x56
