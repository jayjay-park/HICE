7185743,0,t3_4dsvwq,Heres my take. Youll definitely want an i over an i whether its for doing things like gaming or just normal computer tasks. It uses a Tier  PSU. RAM overclocks and RAM speeds arent really noticeable for most things. A CPU overclock helps mainly with things like rendering videos and performing repeated complex algorithmsprograms among other things. In terms of gaming maybe a couple fps increase. If you want to overclock just for gaming its definitely not worth the cost of buying a CPU cooler and getting a Z motherboard. I know you dont plan on overclocking anymore but Im just giving you some advicetips for the future.PCPartPicker part list  Price breakdown by merchantType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core i .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

8953977,0,t3_52ueyv,You can go for an mitx build if u want a smaller build some mitx cases are really nice and compact. You wont need a wifi adapter if you use a gygabite h wifi motherboard for example. I personally suggest u get a gtx  as your gpu. Sells at around ,bapccanada,d7o4uj9,2,t5_32smy
9008694,0,t3_53m66b,Ive put together something for you Ive kept some parts the same because I feel you chose them out of preference andor liking. Switched CPU to i with overclocking potential for processing PhotoshopIllustrator and any other processing needs. Will handle any games you would want to play with high performance. Threw the optional CPU cooler always good to have and can avoid any heating issues in the future.The mobo is the real sweet spot for me tons of room and a full ATX board with extra slots for upgrades. Case is OK good airflow and backside has good cable management capabilities with proper management tools.Intel is a personal preference but I feel the build I posted is much more value for your dollar. Only thing you could bump up is the speed of DDR and go for some super high performance memory.Hope I helped.,bapccanada,d7upcql,1,t5_32smy
