2501362,0,t3_2o9uri,The lake I fish the most due to proximity to my home has a walleye window of about  minutes starting approximately  minutes before sunset. Theres a sporadic night bite and an occasional daytime fish but that sunset time can be crazy productive. Crappies are almost exclusively after dark. Mille Lacs can be a good night lake but Lake of the Woods is pretty much done once the sun goes down.,IceFishing,cml2dvd,1,t5_2s9vx

9779771,0,t1_daieg9y,Thank you!! Thats an extremely valid point I tend to get too wrapped up with the gear side.

10006643,0,t1_dbbrbsn,I have no faith in artic pros. They do not perform that well. My personal pick would be a set of Baffin boots. I believe I have the impacts. Arctic pack boots rated for below . Toasty warm feet Guaranteed. Work so well its unbelievable. They are closer to  but it will be money well spent. Occasionally they go on sale at Cabelas.

10190319,0,t3_5lwx2b,Hey there I use suffix  ice braid lb. Ive found that to get the same strength as the the braided with mono line the equivalent line is very heavybulky in comparison. As well the mono line normally is stiff in cold conditions and doesnt unwind nicely whereas braided has never given me rigidity. As for the frosting problem the ice braid only seems to lose its antifrost effect after a full season of use. Keeping it on going into a second winter has lead me to a frost up or two. Using a light rod with smaller eyelets also is very susceptible to freezeup from my experience. All in all Id recommend braided. ,IceFishing,dbz4nwa,2,t5_2s9vx
