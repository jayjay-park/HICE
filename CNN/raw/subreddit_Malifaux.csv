1933890,0,t3_2gr89b,Youd be suprised at how effectively a model like Dr McMourning or Seamus can be used to represent a character like Ironsides. Of course itll also be necessary to proxy the rest of the crew in a similar fashion perhaps using flesh constructs or rotten belles. At that point in order to avoid confusing yourself andor your opponents Id recommend swapping the rule cards over to those that suit the models and just playing a crew of zombies instead. ,Malifaux,ckm7xrb,2,t5_2sb38

2989070,0,t3_2ue06r,Just like the others have said your opponent with the negative modifier cannot cheat fate. You can since you do not have a negative modifier as long as this is an opposed duel directly against each other. Not a target number duel I can see why you would think this is unfair but it is the nature of the game. Your opponent despite the odds managed to get great flips on the duel. This is your way to counter act his or her luck. The control hand is your most powerful tool. But also think how few cards you get for your hand. That card could have been used for something much different to put yourself in better situation later in the turn of match. Having cards in hand even poop ones can make or break pivotal points in the turn of match.   ,Malifaux,co7tbqf,2,t5_2sb38

5484262,0,t3_3piuym,Leveticus. Hes got the most versatile list options in the game and hes one if the scariest threat generators in the game.He also tends to come at my opponent with a lot of dark gorse potential. While hes commonly played in Outcasts what he does is extremely unique in the game. His resurrection techniques require a very different strategy to attack. His survivability and general absence from the board make things complicated for a lot of schemes like deliver a message and assassinate. On the flip side of that typical vanguard models Joss Izamu The Riders go down to Leveticus like  stone peons.Between Pariah of Iron and Pariah of Bone Leveticus can pull from half of the arcanist and most of the rezzer faction if he wants. Even Rasputinas box are all technically constructs.,Malifaux,cwcnyt1,2,t5_2sb38
6585940,0,t1_d00j4yx,Getting both crews will certainly set you up quite nicely although may need a few tweaks to perform like a well oiled machine. Rami and Francois are quite useful in a Somer list as someone else pointed out and Bayou Gremlins are a decent filler for an Ophelia list. For starters Id reccomend grabbing Somers box and maybe the slop haulers box playing a few smaller point games with them if you do want to try summoner Somer more Bayou Gremlins will be needed. You should be able to figure out what else you want to try from there which I find the books are quite useful for. Barebones I run Somer with Family Tree and Dirty Cheater at least  Bayou Gremlins mostly more and a Slop Hauler. Lenny makes it into my lists quite often but is rarely taken against Neverborn crews because of all their Terrifying and WP duels.The lightning bugs can probably wait though. When youre more comfortable with the crew is when Id add one in and I usually only add one. Theyre available separately and as part of the Wong crew Box.On a side note one of my favorite things to do is take two skeeters and then take the CanOBeans upgrade on Somer. You end up with two hard to kill very quick harrasers that can pump out some impressive AOE damage,Malifaux,d00jg8i,2,t5_2sb38

7742477,0,t1_d3m7fl2,The nice thing about the starter set is that all the models are mercenaries and so can be hired by any crew at any time. Id say youd get as much use out of the starter set models as you would out of any master starter set. You end up having a small number of models you wont use e.g. Lady J gets you  death marshals  youll almost never take ,Malifaux,d3m9hsl,1,t5_2sb38
7742701,0,t1_d3m7fl2,Shoot I mean I dunno how to answer that. Theyre not trash by any means. I picked up the starter box after already having  crews ready to go and could easily find spots for a couple of the models in a couple scenarios. I dont run the particular factions but the models in the starter are all mercenaries which means you can hire them in any crew regardless of faction for an extra cost of . A crew box only gives you somewhere between  points worth models and a normal game is  so definitely as you ramp up theyll still be useful for filling that out.,Malifaux,d3maes7,1,t5_2sb38

8205440,0,t3_4rddhs,If you want a good starting point and for your wife to have the upper hand I would recommend you to play Neverborn and her play guild.

8586220,0,t3_4uue8n,Well the first thing anyone will tell you is that the list will revolve around the table setup schemes strategies and what you know more about the others crews which faction was declared.  Luckily the hag can handle pretty much any scenario so you didnt start in that bad of a spot.  You will want to have an overall plan for how your models interact and a decent idea of how your tactics will work here.  Waldgeists make a fantastic frontline wall especially if there is a lot of shooting opponent declared guild but there is some overlap in defensive abilities with mctavish since he gives nearby allies cover.  The frogs do a good job of objective running but gupps can do that for cheaper swamp mother box set but are a little more fragile.  Ideally they will never see combat and if your big guy dies killing the little ones to bring him back is easier and will dissuade opponents from killing them a bit.Now declaring neverborn really only matters for upgrades here.  So you could expand in either direction depending on your play style and her mercenary list can grab more options.  The following are just a few of the shenanigans people like to pull with her.  The first one anyone will tell you is that a resurrectionist nurse will do wonders for her.  They inject a summoned doll with paralysis and pass it along easily among other bad conditions.  Sorrows can also paralyze the doll easily.  A really fun gremlin addition is the war pig wp so you can take it as a merc if you arent gremlins which can charge for  which means you can use obey in it and charge off that.  Blasts personally I like Hannah and Lazarus for this can target the doll and hit the doll target in the same blast if you are close together.  You can then punch the doll more easily and throw a high card to damage it.  The two I mentioned have a something blast so you can smash someone for .  Its very stone intensive and suboptimal but extremely satisfying to pull off.  If you like the nephilim her obey actions make grow crews work very well.  I actually rather have her lead one than Lilith.  To really enjoy throwing the big guy into combat consider taking killjoy.  When they kill one big target another shows up and then the first comes back to life later.  If you want to go further down the swamp fiend hole gators and wild boars are pretty fun.  The boars are like mini war pigs and mctavish and gators is a very fun way chew through the enemy execute triggers are nasty on these.So if this tells you anything its that zoraida can almost pick any model and make them work better.  As a support master her job is to just make everyone do what they do without her but more effectively while disrupting the enemy a bit.  She isnt the easiest one to learn but she is very adaptable and will be able to handle most situations when you have more experience.Also stitched together are just plain good.,Malifaux,d6ev5ua,1,t5_2sb38

8998753,0,t1_d7qljum,Just a warning if you dont plan on playing as either Guild or Neverborn.  You may only hire  mercenaries at a time and they cost an extra soul stone apiece.  Generally you are much better off picking a master box you like and building from there.  If you do plan on either of those factions its worth it even if you dont choose both of those factions.

10578569,0,t3_5rgog4,Due to the Schemes and Strategy system you very rarely find yourself in an unwinnable position just because you screwed up early on. That being said some masters are tougher and more flexible than others.Summoners tend to be forgiving because they can replenish lost resources or bring in the tools that they need. Ramos Hamelin and Nicodem from the Arcanists Outcasts and Ressurectionists respectively are each hard to kill personally and bring a ton of extra models into the game.Ramos and Hamelin are both Spam summoners  Ramos brings in steampunk spiders potentially three of them for a single action. Hamelin true to his name creates an Engine whereby he summons models that turn into rats that turn into rat kings that turn into rats and rat catchers that spread blight that turn your opponents into rats... It sounds more complicated than it is but if you play Hamelin its good to get those activations down by rote so that the game can ever end.By contrast Nicodem can summon in any Undead Ressurectionist minion  hes your classic necromancer type. He only summons one model per action but he can always bring in the right tool for the job. He also has some excellent buffs that he gives out to friendly undead models nearby.If you dont like summoning Perdita from the Guild is a pretty tough to put down killing master. Leviticus in Outcasts and Seamus in Ressurectionists are highly mobile very deadly tough to put down and bring some clutch summoning.,Malifaux,dd73i9v,3,t5_2sb38
