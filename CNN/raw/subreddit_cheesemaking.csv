1344034,0,t1_cikrmlk,I just tasted my second hard cheese attempt  and it was the farmhouse cheddar from cheesemaking.com and it was good.  The first time I aged it for  days and this time I aged it for  mostly to feel and taste the differences between the timings.  I want to move on to a more true cheddar next and see where I get things  but before that I am going to try one more  day aging with raw milk instead of the best I can find in the store and see how different that is as well.  Its all about experimentation huh?  I love it!  Great job and good luck too!,cheesemaking,ciktid5,1,t5_2sz5r
1491919,0,t3_2b8bif,Hard usually means not fast  at a minimum youre probably looking at  months of aging. Baby gouda is fairly short term and pretty easy to make overall. Plus its a well knownwell received flavor. That would be my recommendation ,cheesemaking,cj3abzr,6,t5_2sz5r

I had to cut about  of an inch off the rind off to eat it. Also a bit sharper than it should be. But all in all it is still a provolone!,cheesemaking,ck9lm1u,8,t5_2sz5r

2936422,0,t1_co1ukrd,Okay. The curd should be a bit on the crumblier side after cooking. Its possible that you didnt let the pH lower enough or that you cooked it for slightly too long or too hot in your water bath expelling a bit too much whey. But it looks like you were on the right track.Hey give it another shot. Itll come out eventually. Also mozz is relatively tough I dont recommend it for first timers. ,cheesemaking,co1vtqg,2,t5_2sz5r

Great looking cave Like emity I am surprised you keep other things in your cheese fridge but each to their own. Can I ask what is the normal temp  RH of your cave? ,cheesemaking,cow2puc,1,t5_2sz5r

9118924,0,t1_d87xnfz,What culture would you recommend? I have picked out some animal rennet. I have  oz raw goats milk and  oz raw cows milk. I think goat cheeses are usually aged for less time so would that be a good place to start? Not to mention being delicious.,cheesemaking,d87y3c5,1,t5_2sz5r

9617675,0,t1_d9pa22v,I found it doesnt cost less to make your own. Its fun though. And if you dont live near a decent cheese monger it can be useful. But if you live near a city with even something like a Whole Foods you can get cheese. ,cheesemaking,d9ykr22,2,t5_2sz5r
10026646,0,t1_dbe8nqa,I dont currently have it any more but I had good luck with a relatively  I think wine fridge. That is meant to run at the desired temperatures and humidity is pretty easy to manage with bowls of water  paper towels allows for more evaporation,cheesemaking,dbehzsl,1,t5_2sz5r
10570480,0,t1_dd69bde,Oops forgot to add if you jar and cover with oil you will get a bit of whey forms a layer on the bottom of the jar.  Dont worry this is normal as is the Olive oil crystalizing at fridge temperature add a little canola if thats an issue.,cheesemaking,dd69fsl,1,t5_2sz5r

10771188,0,t3_5u36yh,I got inspired recently to try making cheese got a beginners kit went across town to buy some lipase and tried making mozzarella. So heres where I thinkI know it affected it I hadnt read through everything and saw that things needed to be kept in the freezer. So I took everything I saw needed to be kept cold and stuck them in the freezer. Took stuff out followed the recipe noticed my rennet was slightly frozen but defrosted it and used it. Pot was too hot as well and eventually I got a mass that would not stick to itself and naturally would not stretch. So totally newbie here am eating my cheese a day later. Not sure what it is. Mostly curious if its even a cheese its creamy and almost like a fine cottage cheese. Not an expert on cheese types either but like I said curious. After googling for a bit I now know Ive ruined my rennet so Im going to buy tablets rather than liquid.  The closest location that sells it is about an hour away and the tablet are easier to find. Im also going to get a digital thermometer. ,cheesemaking,ddqyvle,3,t5_2sz5r
