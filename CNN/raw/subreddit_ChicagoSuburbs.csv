8666613,0,t3_4ylxhi,I know downtown naperville is very pro dogs as I see them walking down the street all day long. There are water bowls every block or so for the dog but as for specific restaurants I have no clue. I think the biggest reason why dogs are walked here is because theres a super nice pet store on one of the corners.If people are walking downtown with a dog they usually have a friend with them as well so they can sit outside with the dog and have their friend take the order. Not sure any restaurants actually allow dogs inside the establishment.Edit I guess naperville is a bit far for just a day trip oh well now you know more about downtown naperville.,ChicagoSuburbs,d6oy2h7,2,t5_2ss10

10641433,0,t3_5s7cho,I live in Rolling Meadows. We paid k for the house in  and were sitting at  a month all in. So k is completely doable. RM has something of an undeserved reputation btw. Youre not going to find a big difference in property tax rates between communities. Im not saying dont do your research on it but dont expect a big difference. There are a lot of great towns around Schaumburg. Without knowing where youll be working its hard to recommend one because we dont know the commute.My advice would be to find an apartment for the first  months. That will give you a chance to research and explore a little bit greatly increasing your odds of getting a house youll love.,ChicagoSuburbs,dddkz6r,3,t5_2ss10
10670338,0,t3_5sllor,I mustve been five or six years old when the outlet center first opened. I remember being there for the grand opening event my father actually being interviewed by a local TV news station or something like that.  Wed only been living in Huntley for a few years at this point.In  or  my mom got laid off at her old job and ended up working here at a clothing store called Bugle Boy before it in turn went bankrupt in .  The giant clearance sale they had let us get a ton of clothes dirt cheap.  Im sure if I dug through my closet deep enough Id still find some old shirts and jeans with the Bugle Boy tag still on them.I ended up going here a lot getting lunch at the food court and marveling at the giant dome above.  My first introduction to arcade machines was there I think.  Walking around in the autumn enjoying the cool weather with family and friends will always stick out in my mind.  The cool little bookstore the discount toy shop and getting trickortreat candy from the employees at every register during Halloween was always a blast for me.  Any time we had someone visiting from out of town we made it a point to visit the outlet center.  On long car rides home going down I seeing that dome lit up at night was always a pleasant reminder Id be home soon.After Bugle Boy closed up shop I had less and less chance to visit the place.  Dont think I went here more than once or twice during my high school years.  Every time I did manage a visit the place seemed more and more empty.  Itll be weird driving by here and not seeing the big dome with the little tower on top in the distance.Progress marches on I guess.,ChicagoSuburbs,ddgkc1c,4,t5_2ss10
