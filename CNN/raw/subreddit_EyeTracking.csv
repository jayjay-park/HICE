211966,0,t1_cf2kh69,it was the next best thing for my hands to using a head or eye tracker  I was able to hold the stylus however I wanted to and pressing the thing down to tap didnt require bending my hand or fingers at all  I could tap with a rotation from my elbow. It was much much better than using a mouse. The only issue was when I tried to use a smallish wacom tablet with a monitor display. It just didnt have the horizontal resolution to be precise or stable.,EyeTracking,cf2l5xu,1,t5_2vucc

11033989,0,t3_5xjcru,Im using an eye tracker in grad school  Ive gotten lasik personally and the issues happen with me on the tracker a fancy k machine for research  a huge portion of the recording is gaps where it has trouble findingtracking. If I recall its especially problematic with me looking at the bottom of the screen like with you. Ive run about  research subjects and issues also happen with people wearing thick andor smeared glasses. I screen my participants out if theyve had lasik so I havent seen it in other lasik patients.It could be because our corneal curvature is off after the laser ablated the surface  its no longer curved normally and throws off the glint? When were looking downward its more likely that the infrared is hitting the ablated surface as opposed to unzapped parts of the cornea.,EyeTracking,deioell,4,t5_2vucc
