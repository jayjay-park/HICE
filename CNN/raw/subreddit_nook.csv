525316,0,t1_cfzu2cw,Yeah you got it.If you are somewhat tech inclined look into rooting the nook with cyanogen mod. It basically loads a normal version of jelly bean and makes it look and act like a normal android tablet... also voids your warranty...If not hopefully your local bampn has a good nook person... stay away from calling the  number.Regardless we definitely have a new nook tablet coming out... unfortunately I wont know anything about it until a day before its released. Feel free to PM if you have any questions down the road!,nook,cfzzg2r,1,t5_2re94

703292,0,t3_226yy6,Yep. Nook Simple Touch did that frequently. The problem was fixed in the Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight product. ,nook,cgk7tjh,2,t5_2re94
1262859,0,t1_cibb9a9,Hey thanks so much for the reply! Im actually on the April Succulent build and I agree its much better than the official Nightlies. I havent had any issues with wifi and even though Im a huge Swiftkey fanuser I decided not to put in on the tablet yet.  I feel it tends to slow things down sometimes and I wanted to see if I could get by with the AOSP keyboard.I actually tried to dirty flash the May rd build over my April build but I got a bootloop and had to format  reflash the old ROM.  Do you factory wipe between ROMs?Thanks again for the reply its hard to find info about this.,nook,cibor94,1,t5_2re94

2691964,0,t3_2qtqqq,Nook does still make them! Theyre in bookmaster under HD replacement cable. You can order them to the store or to their home for .. Look under the gift category. ,nook,cn9yjky,2,t5_2re94
2852395,0,t1_cns3nwc,I dont have much free time to read for fun but I do see a lot of movies and order through fandango! Ill keep posting opportunities through this subreddit if I come across anymore! I gave this one away to the first person to contact me. Thank  you for the upvotes!,nook,cnsbg5k,1,t5_2re94
3086206,0,t3_2veu2a,I hate saying it but I am looking into getting a kindle in a couple months because I see the eink nook dying. I prefer to read off of it and I see it being phased out.,nook,cohvtpk,1,t5_2re94
3206196,0,t1_cotyqf8,What if that doesnt work? I left it a few hours charging more than  and when I got back to it tried the same thing and no luck once again... Should I try and disassemble it? To take the battery out?,nook,coubkst,1,t5_2re94

5545551,0,t1_cwjyo6x,Ive rebooted the Nook many many times. Ive rebooted it while it was connected to my Mac and while its not connected. Ive restarted my Mac with the Nook connected and without it connected. I just cant get the computer to see my Nook. Its maddening. I really appreciate your suggestions. Thank you. ,nook,cwkh65j,2,t5_2re94
6813964,0,t1_d0obaye,Honestly this is what BampN should have done in the first place. I respect the attempt to create a full Hardwaresoftware ecosystem but the Nook series seemed like a halfhearted attempt to attack Fire on their own turf without really connecting it to the benefits of real brick and mortar BampN locations.,nook,d0onrz7,6,t5_2re94
