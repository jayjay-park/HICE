519615,0,t3_1ztc10,I feel a lot like this including the part where you say you can find plenty of things to like about yourself but you still cant imagine other people seeing those things and valuing you for them. Id be willing to bet that the only thing thats stopping you connecting with people and seeing the evidence that they like you is your anxiety itself. For example I tend to be afraid of imposing on people or showing signs that I enjoy their company because I feel like that makes me vulnerable to rejection. In reality people spend time around people who make them feel good  just because theyre not socially anxious doesnt mean they dont want or need affirmation  so if you avoid giving them any theyll tend to assume youre not interested in their company and move on. The more warm and friendly you are to other people the more warmth youll receive in return. I also worry a lot about the right way to respond and try not to do anything that could possibly be interpreted negatively which leads to me not leaving much of an impression on people. What things might you be doing that make it hard for people to connect with you?Now understanding rationally that theres nothing wrong with you and that people are very unlikely to respond anywhere near as negatively as you imagine doesnt mean that you can change your feelings or behaviour overnight. The only way to do that is practice. Prove to yourself that its not that scary the same way one would conquer a phobia of spiders. For me it feels a lot like jumping off a very high diving board  first I remind myself rationally that theres nothing to fear and that even if things do go wrong Ill be able to cope and then I take a deep breath push past my anxiety and go for it screw the consequences. I make the choice to act in spite of my fears. You can start with small relatively easy things and build up. Its true that things could go wrong  youre taking a risk  but that risk is so much bigger in your head than it is in reality. You need to recalibrate your system and train yourself to appraise the threat level of situations more realistically. Lets take the situation in your post. Youve already acknowledged that your relatives are unlikely to outright reject you so your fear is that theyll harbour secret resentment towards you for asking to stay in their house. Well its unlikely to be that much of an imposition on them and if it is they can always refuse. They can even make up an excuse so it isnt awkward  thats their prerogative. That means that if they let you stay theyre probably feeling somewhere from positive to neutral about it. Theres a good chance theyll look forward to the opportunity to catch up with you and perhaps get to know you a little better  they are your relatives after all so theyre predisposed to want a good relationship with you. And if after all they are secretly annoyed about it well so what? Youll never know. You can walk away thinking the visit was a success theyll quickly forget about it and it wont even matter next time you see them. I bet theres hundreds of times youve wrongly believed people think negative things about you so would it be so bad to mistakenly believe something positive for a change?That brings me to another helpful strategy  try to focus on potential positive outcomes rather than potential negative ones. It might feel unrealistic at first but as you see over time the positiveneutral outcomes occur much more often than the negative ones it will become easier and more ingrained. Dont trust your negative thoughts.Good luck!,socialanxiety,cfzc1ly,3,t5_2r22n
521510,0,t3_2024vo,This sounds weird but I was that way with shorts. Im pretty crazy about hiking and ended up wearing technical clothing all the time and I would wear shorts for my leg wear since they wouldnt keep my legs wet and colt like pants would often.  Anyway  I had wanted to wear pants for the longest time but feared the comments about it and put off wearing pants for easily a couple of years there.  It was honestly  years ago that I started wearing long pantsjeans.  At first people talked to me about my missing shorts but after a week of jeans it fell by the wayside and their interests in small talk changed to the weather or things like that.  I had successfully blended in and it was great. You can do it. Itll be weird for a bit like it was for me but you will get more comfortable.

I believe the main difference between introverts and extroverts is that introverts get energized from being alone and drained being around people while extroverts get drained being alone and energized being around people.  I definitely feel like Im an extrovert as I identify with how an extrovert feels but I have social anxiety. I do act like an extrovert around people I know really well and feel comfortable around.

So maybe I end up getting into a situation and even if its going relatively well I never really escape that feeling of distance.. of looking forward to when Im alone again and can see the things around me clearly and enjoyably.  I feel such pressure on dates and at most times to feel lulls in conversation to not talk too much to not talk about myself..  however im approaching it is clearly not working.  Anyway I saw you had no responses and felt for you..  what I feel Id call mild compared to what youve shared here.  I think and Im no expert you should tell her that youre anxious about the date..  if you really want the date stripped from the burden of anxiety and worry if youd still like the date let herhim know that.

1629018,0,t3_2cymry,Im kind of the same... I absolutely kick ass at job interviews but in social situations particularly in groups of more than two or three I suddenly lose the ability to speak. I think its because work and job interviews involve structured conversations  youre there to discuss a specific thing or set of things so theres no surprises in the flow of conversation. Also its not personal so its unlikely you will suddenly be asked an embarrassing question out of the blue. Social situations on the other hand are utterly unstructured. I can never tell where the conversation is going to go and it switches around so freely and so quickly that by the time I can think of something relevant to say were talking about something else now.

Introverts get energyrecharge from being alone while extroverts get energyrecharge by being with people. It just happens that introversion and social anxiety do cross paths for some people. If you already know this just disregard this paragraph haha.How is she with small groupson vs. large crowds? I would assume like seeing new  people at a time might take more pressure off or its easier to have a conversation that way. Does she want to interact with people? Does she interact with people if she has workschool? That might give more insight about her situation. If it is as severe social anxiety as you say she could look into therapy as well. She needs to take small steps before getting into bigger social situations as well. Be supportive of your girlfriend and its good to have a backupescape plan just in case if she has an anxiety attack or shuts down so she can collect herself. Im actually in a similar situation as your girlfriend. I have mildmoderate social anxiety and started dating this guy who is more outgoing and has many friends. We went to a house party the other day and I felt very pressured being the odd one out especially when I am mostly quiet and played beer pong for the first time terribly  . Like I am aware of my situation and I definitely dont want to bother my guy with it.. and I also dont want him to resent me either. He is trying to be considerate but it might be difficult for him to fully empathize. Like were pretty much opposites and supposedly have some similar opinions and whatnot.. but it is hard. I can try and put in effort to meet his friendsfamily but I dont know if I can get better at socializing. It really does take practice and patience in the end. Communication is very important as well. Make sure you both share your needsthoughts. Dont hold back for the sake of the other either.,socialanxiety,cjmsktx,13,t5_2r22n

What is better to say is that you SA made it difficult or impossible to do your job to your satisfaction of yourself or manager.I feel bad for anyone with SA that loses their job due to these issues. It is not something you can help and all you can do is deal with it but alternatively if you do work in retail do not expect to stay employed if you cantrefuse to assist customers. They are running a business and most jobs in general involve some form of customerclient interaction. If you have SA to such a serius degree then you need to be looking for the few jobs that dont require the interaction even if it involves going to school.Im sorry to hear you got let go but this obviously was not the job for you and retail as a whole may not be an option unless you can work on these issues.

He walks towards it and says while laughing Ha Im going to fall into this big hole now. Think about the consequences of you shaking when everyone is looking at you will they laugh? Whisper about you? Or would they just not care. We both rationally know they wont care too much but our anxious minds will always choose the most horrible outcome to attach ourselves to. So lets say they will whisper. Is this something you care about? If so why? Insecurities? Are you not happy with who you are and if so can you do something about it? Do you treat yourself well? Do others treat you well?Keep asking yourself these rational and concrete questions until you eventually find a rational answer.

1957496,0,t3_2h227p,Yes. Ive been on generic Zoloft sertraline since May and its worked wonders for me. I used to have such a hard time just getting out of bed in the morning because I was so afraid to do anything. Ive got mostly social anxiety that really kept me from doing anything. I couldnt go to the store I barely left my room I was terrified to go to work and I couldnt face my family. I had a little generalized anxiety but that went away slowly with therapy since we mostly worked on that for the first year I saw my therapist.I still struggle a little with social anxiety but I dont notice the general anxiety at all and the zoloft even helped quite a bit with depression as well.You can look into some different medications. Lexapro didnt work great for me but zoloft is like a magic pill for me. Talk it over with your doctor or a therapist and they can tell you about the pros and cons of each. Its so worth it to try though. It may take a while to figure out which one works best but Im a function human being now I promise itll get better.Edit Oops Im also on hydroxyzine for emergency as needed anxiety spot treatment. I think Vistaril is the brand name. It definitely helps for quick anxiety relief. I still do breathing exercises and calming techniques along side the medication to maybe trick my brain into thinking its my relaxation techniques that are calming me not the medication. It definitely helps a ton with the social anxiety.,socialanxiety,ckp2xck,2,t5_2r22n

2057403,0,t3_2i68w2,Theres certain types of people that make me very socially anxious.  When I ran track in undergrad I found it very hard to be friends with all but a few people on the team.  They almost seemed cliquish.  My sister also ran track at a different large university and when I hung out with her the people on her team seemed cliquish as well.  She didnt really like them.It was weird but I didnt think much of it.  I just avoided those people for the most part and found friends I didnt feel that way around.  Well this year I met a guy in grad school who does similar research to me and we decided to room together.  It just so happens he also ran track in undergrad and a lot of his friends are runners as well.  Strangely enough I get the exact same vibes around them as I did with those people in undergrad.  He keeps inviting me to hang out with them but each time is a struggle and Ive just started turning down invitations.I dont know what it is.  I cant stand being around them because I feel like Im being judged.  Theyll do things like ask me to hold the camera to take a photo of them and it feels like theres little effort on their part to try and incorporate me into the group and so I make little effort back to try to be part of their group.  If youve ever seen the movie  Jump Street they all act exactly like Dave Francos role.Ill note that I only get these vibes with collegiate competitive runners.  Ive found that club runners or people who run for fun are much easier to get along with.Is your group of friends a clique?  If so perhaps get them to try opening up and making an effort to be friendly.  Do they talk badly about each other when one of them leaves the room?

2097589,0,t3_2itoxj,Hey I know the feeling. What you said about frat parties is often times true but I dont think frat parties are the only way to have fun. I made a post similar to this some weeks ago and someone passed onto me advice that Id like to pass on to you join a club or some sort of organization. As cliche as it sounds its truly a good option. After about a couple of weekends of doing nothing and dreading doing nothing I joined my schools comedy magazine group and pushed myself to go to their events and it has helped me out immensely. There are meetings every week and gettogethers on some weekends. Though Im not the most talkative person in the group Ive been able to meet new people and make friends. Being passionate about whatever the club is about will give you an extra incentive to go there and help alleviate your SA thoughts. I believe that for the majority of us we need some sort of social connections and interactions to stay sane. You might feel like it is an impossible task to connect with other people and establish that solid friend group in college. Hell Im still trying to do that. But you may never get there unless you try and put yourself out there. I guarantee youll feel way better for trying and failing then for just not trying at all. If you adopt that mindset I believe that you can find new ways to meet other people and have fun.TLDR Clubs are a great way to make friends  club helped me personally youll feel better trying and failing to make friends then not trying at all.,socialanxiety,cl6g7fa,1,t5_2r22n

But normally I like when employees recognize me because I rarely switch up my orders at Starbucks or fast food places. So its nice to know I can get what Im there for with minimal talking. Just oh hey its tvgirl. Heres your latte. Now its pretty irritating when they hire someone new and I have to talk a lot more to answer questions what kind of milk?

Im a little older than everyone else actually  now and so its very hard for me to find someone with mutual interests. Everyone was going out with their flatmates and getting drunk while I was in my pyjamas at home getting high and watching movies. Not really a very social person. I also found myself not talking a lot during conversations Id only say something if I really had something to say I think that puts people off cause they would think Im not interested enough. Ive joined societies and went to some events and met people here and there but never someone I really stayed in touch with. Being by myself mostly during my first year and not fitting in did effect my performance a lot. I just didnt have the drive for it I felt like an outsider and always asked myself what am I doing here? I dont belong here. But I just pushed through now in my second year a lot of people dropped out which means that theres a lot less people and also the program demands social interaction through seminars. So Im meeting a lot of people now and I feel more like Im in the right place. Ive been to the health service went through counselling and after  sessions I stopped going. By telling the counsellor my issues I also understood myself better. Its like when you talk about things you listen to yourself as well and you understand where it comes from. Dont just let this float around in your mind all the time it really helps to talk about it. Just the process of opening up already changes your attitude towards your anxiety thats progress. You will find people to hang out with along the way some people start enjoying college life in their final year.  weeks into freshman year is very early give it some time. Also smoking weed doesnt help anxieties. In my experience they only made my social anxieties worse. Theres this saying in Dutch  Het leven is een feest maar je moet zelf de slingers ophangen.

Youre not alone and this will pass and be just a memory. Are you seeing a therapist?Its better to get some done than none which you can start right now. Set a timer for  min and start writing a stream of consciousness. After a bit of venting try to direct it towards your assignment. Write about what you do know what about the topic makes you anxious or what unanswered questions you have. Hopefully that will get you into the flow of things and trick your subconscious into letting you work. Do it now.,socialanxiety,cmi17xq,3,t5_2r22n
2485484,0,t3_2nyn4a,Yes.  If I fall behind on an assignment happens often because of ADD it is tough for me to show up and not have the assignment.  Even when at a conscious level I know it probably isnt a big deal I picture myself having to look the professor in the eye and explain why I dont have it done.  Once I start missing classes it becomes harder and harder to show back up because I feel like I need to explain where I was.  Usually the result of this process is that falling behind on a single assignment is that it snowballs into me having to drop the class.,socialanxiety,cmizovi,1,t5_2r22n

2571008,0,t1_cmu5781,You are correct it is not immediate. Ive been in therapy for a little over three years including a  month stay in a daytreatment center. The improvement is so gradual that you wont notice that after X number of sessions that your life is immediately better. Its more like... after a few months youll notice that the hard stuff isnt as hard and that youre making small improvements. Therapy is work and it takes a while. I am in a much better place than I was a year or two years ago. There are things that I challenged in therapy this year that I was convinced I would never be able to do. And now those things are easy and not a problem for me. Theres no way to know how long youll need in therapy and its different for everyone. Dont worry about forcing yourself to recover from your anxiety by a certain time or date or number of sessions. Let the process happen naturally and one day youll wake up without anxiety and youll have a hard time remembering the last time you had a panic attack. Panic attacks were something I struggled with immensely this year and I havent had one in weeks! Be open be honest and be willing to tackle the tough stuff in therapy and you will totally overcome your anxiety. Best of luck and Im so happy that youre starting this leg of your journey! ,socialanxiety,cmu63kd,4,t5_2r22n

2685655,0,t3_2qs6qy,Firstly I think its definitely related because you have to out on a front in front of people because you think theyll react negatively. Secondly if anybody said anything to you about the topic being irrelevant Id tell then where to go because were all here for the same reason when it comes down to it.I think youll definitely regret it if you dont pursue voice acting. Lets get real here how lucky are you to have found something you love doing and how likely are you to find something like that again? Youve found your escape no wonder you feel so bad if you cant take it.And not to insult your family or anything since when the hell is voice acting girly? Last I checked it was mainly guys who were voice actors and even if that werent the case it wouldnt make a difference.I know that just below all of your self doubt because of the years of disparaging comments you know there is nothing wrong with having this as a hobby. And youre right. Completely. So remember that every single time someone tries to put you down about.Im sorry I cant offer you any advice on how to avoid any physical altercations but I completely understand why even though you could take him in a fight you dont want to. Id hate for you to have to hide your hobby...but is there anyway that you can practice and just do what you like without them around for the time being? And when you get really good you can prove them wrong? If that isnt an option I dont know what else you can do...maybe when they come into your room when your practicing just deny it and say you were watching videos or tell them you were only kidding? I think it might be a good idea for you to join an acting club! Even if it isnt voice acting exactly there could be elements in it and you can channel your impersonation techniques into being a convincing actor while being able to express yourself through acting. It could also be the chance to show people the real you by meeting people who like the same things you do DAgain Im sorry I dont know from personal experience so I cant really help but I hope you can start being yourself more because we are all what we are interested in ,socialanxiety,cn94vk5,2,t5_2r22n

Yeah some weekends people got really annoying and kept me up but it wasnt too bad. I didnt stick with college though too much stress for me and I couldnt handle it.

2883923,0,t3_2t5jja,Ha fuck that. Theres times you have a legitimate reason to overcome your anxiety and interact but things like this are just plain awkward for everyone. There is no element of meeting people who youve not spoken to in years and had no reason to  thats not completely awkward. This is why I avoid having Facebook etc. Best thing you can do IMO is to just practice a few lines of small talk to circumvent some pseudo conversation filler nod and seem vaguely interested and get past it as soon as possible  if it really is forced. If its only forced by social obligation Id probably not go haha but then Id probably realise its for the best and will save the following weeks of anxiety in which I worry about how I came acrosswhat I said did I do anything wrong etc. ,socialanxiety,cnvwkl5,2,t5_2r22n

2913963,0,t3_2ti3p8,My reasoning for this and it might be completely wrong in your case! is that because when you have social anxiety you meet on average less people than a socially out going person. This means that you tend to remember the people you do meet more prominently  especially those you find attractive and especially if they were part of an anxious memory or something but in either case you tend to become more attached to them.But yeah I get it. Tends to be like I mentioned though  when Im going through quiet spells where as if Im in a job and meeting lots of people day in day out that I find quite attractive Ive not had it happen.

2952525,0,t3_2tz39u,What got me over a lot of my anxiety is the word Sonder which is the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own  not my words.Everyones world is just as complicated as yours insofar as you are just a random passerby for them. They expect nothing from you. Maybe theyre checking you out maybe theyre making quick insignificant mental judgements or maybe theyre lost in thought and looking right through you. In short you mean nothing to them and thats to your benefit. Knowing that people really dont care about you until they have to can be very freeing.I used to be the same as you even going so far as to avoid going out of my home when my neighbors were outside in case they wanted to talk. But really they dont care about me. Maybe they have some interest in how Ive been or how my holidays were. But in the end theyre more worried about all the stuff buzzing around in their head and dont have time to waste brain cycles on me.,socialanxiety,co3ps8j,6,t5_2r22n

But by listening and picking up on smaller details you are able to hold a conversation longer. Ive also found it helps to not focus so much on one topic. I used to be afraid of switching topics because I didnt know how the other person would react. Now I try and listen to what they are saying and if they mention something I know about I try and steer the conversation that direction.

3360912,0,t3_2ylmxi,I really cant function well when Im stoned social anxietywise but after the effects start to wear down Im usually fine for the rest of the day. Depends on what you might call fine. Dosing is key though. I feel that that relaxed feeling is attainable more rapidly and constantly by smoking  smaller joints over the course of the day as in a rolled cigarette  a couple of crumbs or a small pinch of keef. To me isnt a big deal since I also smoke cigs anyway but to many weed afficionados seems to be an unforgivable offense against the holy plant. My only problem is that longterm use as in oncetwice a day for more than two months worsens the anxiety introversion depression and all other sideproblems overall when sober.

3396502,0,t3_2z398v,I have no friends so in the last  months Ive been making a big effort to get out and socialize. I can talk to people but I always feel like they are talking to me out of politeness rather than actually wanting to talk to me.For example I started volunteering at a garden and occasionally Im assigned to dig a hole with one or two people for a couple of hours. In those situations people are pretty much forced to talk to me rather than spend that time in awkward silence. But I can tell they are just doing it out of politeness as they dont make any effort to talk to me outside those situations.I know a lot of this is just me projecting my negative thoughts onto other people. But at the same time I truly believe that I put out some sort of unlikable vibe. I dont like myself and people pick up on that. My conversations are never as relaxed and freeflowing as I want them to be and theres no connection. I personally dont think Im worth talking to and it ends up being self fulfilling.

3431308,0,t3_2zix3y,Honestly I have no idea but that is how it feels like youre concerned about what everyone thinks of you. For me the fear of the awkward feeling Ill get if I act in a certain way that other people dont appreciate dont find funny or something that feeling is enough to make me not want to say or act outside of a sort of list of safe conversation points and behaviours. Feeling like Ive left a bad impression makes it much harder to try speak to this person again which would be fine if I didnt care for socialising making new friends but I do want to do those things and I guess I worry too much about all the ways I could screw that up. Got to agree with the self esteem thing too.Id recommend being cautious when asking her why she cares what others think. For me Ive been recently doing CBT trying to confront some of this anxiety and even at the first step of trying to understand what my actual thoughts are about a situation that makes me anxious I realise how irrational those thoughts are. Thats nice in a way a lot of my problems come from an irrational and biased perspective so all I have to do is change that right? And yet no matter how hard I think of a rational unbiased perspective I still get anxious in many situations and that can be really disheartening. Its important to remember there is no quick fix you have to accept who you are in the moment and whilst youre not where you want to be you might be closer than yesterday or last week or last year and thats all you should care about and all that matters.So yeah Im trying to improve certain things. I cant say whats been successful yet. I believe CBT is fairly common and whilst I think its best to see a professional CBT is something that seems very geared towards self help and so a good book with exercises and the right attitude may be useful.

3699851,0,t3_32r9oc,You need to have the ability of identifying the good people from the bad. Well there is no such thing as good people or bad people only a good person or bad person in your opinion. Know which person treats you with respect and know who doesnt. Just because someone committed a social crime against you doesnt mean that you go off and recluse yourself. We need to be connected with people but mostly importantly the people that care about you. If you can see or feel that someone treats you with unacceptable disrespect make a move and decide whether to cut them from your life or not. Once you make the move you cant ever go back. You have to decide to dissociate or to not associate with this specific person. You dont need to have an aggressive stance just dont stay near them and if they do happen to be near you act like theyre not there. If you could press a button just press the ignore button. If theyre willing to spend the energy to destroy the infrastructure that you barely have I believe that you shouldnt care about them neither. You dont need to have this idea in the back of your head of theyre my enemy I wish them the worst or something like that because that becomes a grudge and grudges affect you. Be angry feel the anger and the evil but move on. You made your decision case closed good luck bud just dont get near my road. If you do I dont see you. I dont have anything against you I just have better things to look at more positive or lively things. Also dont be afraid of letting them or anyone else know that you are avoiding them. When someone causes you immense pain every step away from them is worth it. Dont care what anyone says just believe in your decision. People dont change around you and if they do thats probably once in a blue moon.

5026679,0,t3_3jriol,You sound very much like my husband and I although his anxiety is not as severe.  He is a very introverted individual and Im extremely outgoing.  Weve been together for fifteen years and we still work on it to this day.  Its going to take a lot of patience from you and he both  you needing to understand its difficult for him to do simple things him needing to understand that if he does love you that he needs to continue whats hes done and working on himself.How are your relationships with your friends and each others friends?  His friends are a large part of why we work so well...aside from the fact that his best friend is the one who introduced us I became good friends with his other friends over the years.  They help the situation in that he doesnt have to fill his attention.  So if he does have close friends friends that were there before you came into the picture and are still close with him you might want to enlist their help...we go out as a group a lot and it helps.One thing Ive had to adjust to is the puppy love extinction.  We were together for a couple of years when we first got together  young and in love.  PDA was never an issue.  We broke up got back together after a couple of years after hed joined the military and grown up and the PDA dicipated.  Not completely but we arent all over each like we used to be even tho sometimes I kind of push it.  It makes him uncomfortable and I have to understand that...some days  situations he is more affectionate than others so I work hard to play off his cues.Compromise is the biggest thing.  Want to go out?  Let him pick the placeactivity.  If theres something  somewhere you want to go?  Ask him to go with you and if hes not up for it that day call a friend to go.  Make sure he understands you arent trying to push him or guilt him for not wanting to go and TRY not to make a big deal of it.  It sucks sometimes  Id be lying if I said it never bothered me that he isnt more outgoing but hey... years have gone by and were still together and are happier than ever.  And over the years its gotten WAY better  he even surprised me Thursday that we are going away next weekend with our friends...HUGE improvement.So what Im saying is  it takes a lot of time and dedication.  Being the outgoing one you will have to make more sacrifices  but Im guessing since you are the outgoing one that you are most likely the more flexible and understanding one as you probably like me dont pull punches.Youve been together for three years  that says something.  It says you are both in it for the long haul and youre making it work.  If it does come to a head that its too much for either of you make sure you talk about it...get a mediator if necessary friendfamily membertherapist.  If its worth it youll make it work.,socialanxiety,curwml8,3,t5_2r22n

Just because society tells us that after high school we should go to college get married buy a house have a career have a family etc doesnt mean you have to follow that norm. You dont have to do anything you dont want to. Just because you are  doesnt mean you have to get out there and make it. Do what you want when you are ready to do so. You dont have to do what everyone else is doing. Society seems to tell us we have to do this this that etc or we arent accomplished or validated as a human being.

I really dont think its related to the anxiety at all. If anything its helped because I didnt use to be brave enough to even speak online or comment on reddit or anything online.  I think the more you try to get back into a friend group you will start socializing again but Im guessing it will take some time. Do you have any friends you game with that you know too?

I have been thinking lately about trying out a few different places with the goal of finding someone that I can go to consistently.Another reason I am not comfortable with hair cuts is that I dont really know what to say when asked what I want done with my hair. Before I start that search I want to decide on what I can say.

Ive actually made a couple friends this way through everyone else probably thinks Im autistic. Probably not the best thing for your situation but it certainly changes peoples perceptions.

What helped me the most was getting a job where I was forced to interact with strangers everyday. Books youtube videos medications therapy all that stuff only puts small dents in the problem.

I regressed into a lurker lost friends only spoke to my boyfriend through PM. I still remained in the chat but as an idler.

Even if Im feeling fine or not very anxious I feel something must show in my body language that tells people to feel nervous or steer clear. I was curious one day and asked my SO  he said in a nice way that it is because I seem anxious and it can make others feel the same or even uncomfortable. Im sure during times of high anxiety I do not smile much either unfortunately Of course I have no clue if this is true in your situation. Its not pleasant to think about but its not your fault either. You sound like a very nice and likable person and I wouldnt put too much credence into how others are reacting.

6013227,0,t1_cy7a5dr,I can relate to that feeling too. I mean when you cant explain why youre having a hard time socializing which seems to come so naturally to people around you you start feeling like you must be sick or something is wrong with you. If thats truly the case then getting a diagnosis is helpful whether you get treatment from a doctor or try help yourself. If its not labelling yourself as broken or sick really is shooting yourself in the foot in terms of self esteem and attitude and makes things worse. A lot of my family has a mental illness. Its as common as the cold for us Probably mostly genetic. Thing is.. You still would have to adapt whether you have a mental illness or not. Its just harder if you do than if you dont because then youre fighting an illness probably medication side effects not just poor social skills and poor self esteem. ,socialanxiety,cy7v1yi,2,t5_2r22n

6142521,0,t3_3zosfv,I doubt they will be very dubious. Its more likely that an automatic fraud prevention kicked in and you going in to fix it is just a formality. Think about your goal at the bank and how you can express it in words. Something like I tried to buy a car but then you the bank blocked my account. How can I get it unblocked? Once you get that out of the way you can let the bank lead. Theyll ask followup questions or refer you to whoever you need to see. When you arrive at the bank take some slow deep breaths. There are apps for diaphragmatic breathing which may help or you could look up instructions on diaphragmatic breathing. The breathing will help you stay calm and hopefully because youve planned what to start with you can get started without stressing too much. Even if it turns out youre super stressed and anxious you can still do it. You managed the car testing even if it was super hard and you hated it and you can manage the bank too. Just go and get it done then it will be over and you dont have to do it any more.

6386002,0,t3_434hal,I understand how you feel. I just finished school and while I was there I hardly ever talked to anybody unless I was forced to because of a group project or something. I rarely made friends with anybody I had class with and for those I did get along with Im not friends with anymore but for me that isnt the reason I go to class. I go to class for one reason and that is so I can pass the class and move on. So let me ask what is it that you expect when going to class? Are you worried about not being able to make friends? Or worried about what others think of you? Because for me it was a little different. I would just go to class and pretty much ignore everybody and honestly hope that no one would talk to me because it would be easier and leave immediately when class is done. And thats what I wanted. There have been classes where I have never spoken a word to any of my classmates or even the professor. However I have been worried about what people think when I do skip class. And if I knew people in the class it was harder because I guess I care more about what people think when I know them thus motivating me to not make friends in class so if I do happen to skip class I wont feel as bad. As for what your professors think of you I would always tell myself that they have been teachers for a while and have a ton of students every semester so there has got to be other students that were way worse. For example there was one semester where I actually missed a test ended up failing the class then retook the class with the same professor. The whole time I would be thinking that the professor thinks really low of me because I missed a test didnt even approach him about it and now Im here again. I just kept telling myself theres no way Im the worst student hes ever had. I wish I could give you better advice or advice at all but I can only relate to your situation. I suppose I managed to get through school because I felt that earning that degree was too important to have what other people think of me affect it. So maybe it might help to change your mindset on why you go to class. Youre going for yourself. Not for the professor not for the other students. Their lives arent affected if you fail. But yours is. Thats how I managed to make it though and it is way worth it ,socialanxiety,czfirwn,2,t5_2r22n

I had a few uncomfortable moments when I was first learning to use them and it kept having trouble reading my card.I feel you its frustrating when you come up with a good commentresponse and youre likeah why didnt I think of this earlier? But having worked as a cashier twice I can tell you that this guy probably didnt think you were that awkward. You sort of go on autopilot ringing up transaction after transaction. Saying stuff like have a nice day is completely automatic and even people who seem confident and chatty dont respond sometimes. But we never talked negatively about customers who were quiet or didnt want to make small talk. We were too busy gossipping about the people who were stealing sexually harassing ! employees yelling at us for no reason etc. I was terrified when I first applied to one of these jobs but you know I think it really helped me get over some of my anxiety. I was forced to interact with people all day but I had a script to follow and it helped me to see that most people actually feel neutral not negative towards me. It felt good to help people when they had questions and even when they were angry I knew it had nothing to do with me  minimum wage employees definitely dont set store prices!,socialanxiety,d1ind2f,1,t5_2r22n

7397309,0,t3_4dwv3h,This is a late reply but I was browsing through the recent top posts in this sub and noticed the post title because I could related to it. Recently I went through many job interviews.  For months almost a whole year.  Several applications several interviews several....rejections.  It hurt a lot.  I knew why.  Because I wasnt great at presenting myself in front of others.  I was not a good speaker.  I was too damn quiet and shy.Finally after many tries someone actually hired me!  Later on I was discussing with the person who interviewed me.  We were talking about why she hired me.  She said she liked that I was calm and quiet.  She said I didnt seem like someone who wouldnt BS them and wouldnt go off and do some crazy stuff on their own. Basically I seemed like someone who was under control. Finally I was a good fit for a job.So I guess the lesson is dont feel ashamed.  Someone will eventually see your great qualities.  You will be a perfect fit somewhere.

Maybe she doesnt want to lend out her clothes. Maybe she thinks playing dressup sounds a bit childish. Instead look to keep adding value to her by saying Im starting to think about outfits. I might wear XYZ. Look at these pins that are so cute! I want them so bad! I bet youd look great in this this and this! What are you thinking of wearing?!By doing this youre helping her get ideas sharing cool fashion probably interesting her in the convo and not looking to get anything in return! Maybe then closer to the date you can say Ugh I wish I had a white flowery crop top! Ill really dont want to order one just for this! and maybe one of the girls will offer to lend hers if she has one! If they dont just handle it yourself as no one wants friends who are always trying to get things from them!The thing is to give value and not ask for anything in return.

So really other than the staff and photographers no one is going to notice you that  isnt a friend or family there to support you. As far as advice goes if they let you choose what order you get to walk in maybe try being one of the last people to graduate. Often graduates and their families leave shortly after walking the stage so there should be considerably less people watching towarda the end rather than the beginning if that is something that would help.

Theres no predicting the future so perhaps theres less reason to get anxious for one action than another.You dont have any other options like a friend or Uber?I dont know your relationship I dont know how supportive he is otherwise I would hesitate to offer anything on that but from what you provide it sounds like hes basically forcing you into this to force you to drive?

8110542,0,t3_4q72w2,School. Work. Neighborhood. Does anyone really make friends outside of this? Someone pretty much has to be within your proximity in order to naturally become friends with them otherwise its forced. Even if you have mutual interests and goals it can still be hard to maintain a naturalfeeling friendship if you live too far apart. You can work together but aside from that... nothing can grow without a retarded amount of effort. So... You can get a real job move to an area with apartments that are in units rather than one big building. That way you see the same people pretty much every day. Believe Im crazy. Ill put my balls on the line to get what I want and  thing Ive wanted was friends like you. Ive tried everything and the relationships Ive made at work and with neighbors have been inescapable. Ive also tried to make friends through mutual interests. We hang out a few times and really give it a go but it just feels like a waste of time and it kind of is. Think about school. Friendships came naturally because you saw each other every day. I bet once you graduated most of those people who you loved were best friends with shared experiences with I bet most of them you didnt even stay in touch with at all. And thats before everyone moved away. I can keep a better friendship with a janitor a coke whore a flamboyant gay and an old lady over someone who is just like me if they are neighbors. If you want a fun thought experiment think about how impactful proximity is in other way. Religion culture beliefs language accents style...FRIENDS.edit Sorry about the fail writing abilities.

8213093,0,t3_4rtecg,Hi I agree with the others who have posted here suggesting you try a different therapist. While it is common to include some form of anxiety reduction skill meditation mindfulness andor physical relaxation skill as part of therapy for social anxiety that is usually just one small part of the program. If you already know those things I can definitely understand how you felt it was not good use of your time and money.Try out at least a couple more professionals. It is very important that you feel you could respect trust and even like the person you choose to work with as well as agree with the type of program they are offering. There are many ways to address Social Anxiety  the most successful programs contain at least some CBT  cognitive behavior therapy .Dont give up.

I was really shocked sitting down with a therapist who asked me objective questions how much it forced me to think of my thoughts my feelings and my motivations for things.

8662578,0,t3_4ygd3r,OP I would strongly recommend that you dont do online school. This will not solve your problem it will likely exacerbate it. I know you dont want to hear it but avoiding this will only make it worse. I promise it is never too late to accomplish this particular goal. But you have to take action and isolating yourself is a step in the wrong direction. First thing is to just get comfortable with talking to strangers which is not something that youre either born with or not its something you learn with practice. So when youre out just ask people where stuff is. Asking people something simple like that is a really great way to introduce yourself to the concept of meeting new people. Itll ease your brain into the notion of interacting with strangers and before you know it youll be able to talk to classmates. When you sit down in class just ask the person next to you about the reading or about the test or just introduce yourself. It doesnt have to be some worldbreaking witty insightful comment like  of the population has the ability to consistently make those it just has to be something. I promise you the vast majority of people are very open to new friendships and conversation.They might be extroverted and already inclined to converse or maybe theyre nervous as well and in that case theyll be VERY happy you spoke to them. And remember that you can do this in every class with different people for the rest of your time in college. pro tip  you can do it anywhere! Theres no pressure to get it right every time. Its a learning curve but you will learn and youll get more and more comfortable doing it. Good luck!,socialanxiety,d6oful4,3,t5_2r22n
8673651,0,t3_4yqzwy,The first therapist I had was pretty cold as in wed get to talking about really painful stuff Id be an emotional wreck and to me it would feel like it took so much effort to think things through figure out how they related what I wanted to say that Id just sit there quiet and completely inmyhead for minutes at a time.  Then I watched a scene in Celebrity Rehab where this girl did exactly the same thing and Dr Drew was all Shes completely dissociated in her head she cant even hear us now and it explained a lot to me.I dont think it was the best way to handle it but doing that for a year got me slowly used to them and numbed to those experiences.My new therapist is much more skilled at helping me through them helping me dig into the feelings of them instead of just letting me stew in them and have all that pain.These experiences have me believing that this is resolved by experiencing nonthreatening communication with other people and psychologists are the people who are trained in setting up a safe environment where you can experience talking without being judged or criticized and slowly get past this dissociation.,socialanxiety,d6pttyz,1,t5_2r22n

Also maybe you can meditate. Meditation helps with accepting your feelings. It helps you observe your feelings and take them for what they are and not feel guilty for feeling that way.

9113540,0,t3_551xbx,I have anxiety issues like this too amp the only thing I can suggest is that you seek out a school counsellor since you are in college and its likely free or subsidized.  I find talking it out with a professional can help to realign your thoughts which can further to adjust your behaviour and so reduce the anxiety CBT.  The only issue is that depending on how established your counselling services are you may end up booking once a month or every few weeks which may lessen the impact and memorability of the sessions from personal experience amp others.  Otherwise I wish you luck! ,socialanxiety,d87atmy,1,t5_2r22n

9218540,0,t1_d8jznpx,Nobody is enabling anything. I have advised people on this sub to take action to get better. To go to therapy. To exercise. To meditate. Thats useful advice. What Im not doing like you is calling for people to feel guilty and horrible for failing to act on advice. How does that help? It doesnt. And actually thats one of the reasons for anxiety people feel horrible and guilty about themselves. We feel guilty if we fail to go out one night as the advice told us to. We feel guilty if we fail to look people in the eyes during conversation. We feel guilty if we fail to establish a fluid conversation with people. Feeling guilty is the last thing we need if we want to make progress in overcoming social anxiety. Because feeling horrible about ourselves only feeds the feelingsthoughts that say were inadequate and we cant handle what other people can normally handle. What we need is to have compassion towards ourselves. Its O.K to fail because we all  anxious and nonanxious people  fail. We all make asses out of ourselves at some point in life. We all make mistakes. If someone has lived with anxiety all these years and they were unable follow advice theres no reason to feel bad about it. Whats important is that one has the ability to start today. Dont focus on the past. You are hoping OP gets mad at you. Meanwhile I hope he ignores your horrible advice. I hope everyone ignores it. And I advice you that in the future if you dont have anything constructive to say please dont say it. ,socialanxiety,d8kin5q,1,t5_2r22n

9282833,0,t3_57h2qi,Oh man. So not always but while I was on my way out I could occasionally manage to make social anxiety work to my advantage. In fact it was a story about a onenight stand that helped me reconnect with my sister.  Enjoy fellas. Props to all of us with absolutely no game.gt I was just outside pacing in the sunlight and rubbing my scalp pondering this mornings decision to shave my face but not my head when I had a bit of a revelation. Its going to take a while to explain so bear with me but I promise it will all come back to this.gt Ive been making an effort to get over my social anxiety and Ive been working on clawing my way out of my shell but its going to be a long arduous journey involving an indepth analysis of the philosophical framework of ethics and morality upon which I choose to live my life. It was in one of these moments of introspection that I found myself questioning my balance of priorities between the rejection of materialism and homogeneity and the acceptance of the fact that other peoples opinions of me are based entirely on their sensory inputs and looking good isnt necessarily a bad thing.gt Id already spent this week confirming my rejection of the concepts of right and wrong and trying to reject the concepts of objectively better and worse so caving in to fashion trends simply because theyre trendy wasnt really an option. Mom you may have noticed when we went shopping I knew what I wanted and what to ask for. I didnt let the salesgirls we had plenty of them last year throw me. I got one last year. I liked it and I wanted more.gt Likewise giving in to advice simply because I respect the person giving the advice isnt going to fucking happen. I value my own opinion of myself and the effort it takes to maintain that opinion far more than any criticism anybody might have to offer. They are not me they do not know my objectives.gt While pondering that it occurred to me that it might actually help people to be informed. It occurred to me that when I told you I had had a onenight stand recently you may not have meant it as an insult when you asked how did that happen? So tastefully edited for discretion heres how.gt I did not head to the Irish pub looking to take anyone home with me. I went there looking for a Reuben. I had shaved that day including my scalp but I was in my beatup boots some beatup jeans I was wearing my Portrait of a Walrus as a Young Man Tshirt and my leather motorcycle jacket. I entered asked the hostesses whether I was likely to find space at the bar and after making a circuit looking for a stool I returned to ask them if I could get food service on the patio.gt I waited patiently for the waitress and enjoyed a beer while waiting for my sandwich. By the time Id finished the sandwich and my second beer a pair of young ladies had appeared behind me. When I turned around and noticed them they apologized for startling me. I clarified that I was only surprised that they had moved because Id seen them sitting at the table directly inside the window a few minutes earlier. Apparently being noticed was flattering and they offered to buy me a shot. I took them up on the offer and asked for Woodford Reserve. One of the young ladies told the bartender to make it a double.gt We had our shots then went to sit with their neighbor a big guy who looks out for them when they go drinking. We talked.gt At some point they asked me why I decided to start shaving my head I was honest told them Id been losing my hair since I was  I went for Halloween as Walter White liked the look and never looked back. At which point they asked if they could rub my head. Shortly thereafter one of them climbed in my lap and asked me to take her home.gt I dont have game. I dont want it. The closest thing I used to a line was admitting that I have faults. The dialogue went something like this.gt D No judgement here. Ive got my faults too.gt M Oh yeah? Like what?gt D Like I recently discovered Im a dog person thats been living his entire life as a cat person. Ive been cold and closed off but Im discovering Im all about that unconditional love. And Im trying to be more open with myself and others about my feelings but thats not usually something Im vulnerable enough to discuss before pillow talk.gt Me being genuinely me is why my onenight stand happened. My pickup line was me admitting that my pillowtalk is me listing off the reasons why I dont think I should be in a relationship right now.gt And thats the reason I dont always shave. Im not always comfortable with the attention I receive. I went to the pub looking for a sandwich but having to choose between two roommates is not the kind of sandwich I had in mind. So until Im comfortable fending off advances from women with whom I dont wish to be romantically involved Im okay with having a few rough edges.gt And until I learn to be less defensive Im going to have to settle for being a little abrasive. Im sorry for assuming that your inquisitiveness was you making assumptions about me. That book Brian advised you to give me had me a little off kilter. I had a whole letter written to prepare you for having a Discussion with mom on the topic of unsolicited advice and why its wrong but during her visit I teased out enough information during our discussions to make a fullblown Discussion unnecessary.gt But while were on the topic of Brian and things we need to discuss Id really appreciate it if youd stop warning people that Im weird before you introduce them to me. When people discover my eccentricities one at a time Im the charming and mysterious stranger rather than your weird brother. Id appreciate it if you stop using your subjective opinion of my life choices to prejudice other people against me.,socialanxiety,d8so034,1,t5_2r22n

9326858,0,t3_584vgw,My social anxiety while still present has gotten TONS better over the years. Im  now. The thing that helped me the most especially with social interactions was this realizationMost people seem conditioned to only remember extremes situations people conversations movies etc. Because were all bombarded with so many messages ads and Facebook posts on a daily basis  it takes A LOT for people to remember those awkward insecure moments that people with SA exaggerate in their minds. Which is great news! It means that while you may feel like that thing you saidthat awkward encounterthat moment you mumbled something was EARTH SHATTERING  put yourself in the other persons shoes for a moment. Do you really think they found it as strange as you think they did? And even if they said huh...that was weird. how long do you think they dwelled on it? A few minutes probably. An hour maybe? But unless you did something really wacky and out there like went into the coffee shop naked with a monkey on your shoulder the moment was probably forgotten as soon as your interaction ended.And you can lean in to those longer conversations by doing small things outside of your comfort zone Call a store to ask what time they close email someone who was featured in a newspaper article that you read and enjoyed make a comment to a stranger in line Wow that is some rain were having huh? And each time remind yourself that those interactions can only reflect negatively on you your character if you let them.Another thing Ive found is that for all the fake it til you make it advice thats out there  if youre an honest sincere person people will be able to pick up on that. If you approach your conversations with the goal of building relationships like in a sales role and being truly helpful most people will want to continue speaking with you.Its not easy and it takes time but its worth doing. Most people out there are good kind and interesting. Everyone has a story. Everyone feels insecure sometimes. Ive met CEOs of multimillion dollar companies who were as quirky as I am!

So SA isnt just one thing or a list of symptoms it often comes in a whirlwind of issues such as anxiety fear of failure emotional regulation agoraphobia codependence selfworth issues etc.  This sounds like you are really disconnected from yourself which certainly comes along with the issues that cause SA.I first went into therapy with this vague If I knew what would make me happy Id just do it.  I ponder for days and have no clue what I could do that would make me happy.  I found that forging a connection with a therapist let me forge a connection with myself and put me in touch with that.,socialanxiety,db63g0e,1,t5_2r22n
9971829,0,t1_db7btqy,I didnt say anything was wrong with you. Im just telling you that society is going to judge you for being quiet. You dont like it? Thats tough. Nobody is going to change societys perception of quiet people overnight. I personally dont believe anything is wrong with being quiet Im just telling you that from my experience quiet people are always singled out moreso than people who talk a lot.So you think teachers should just ignore students who dont talk andor are shy? I used to be shy and having teachers pick on me actually made me more confident and at ease in the class. It made me feel included like somebody cared about what I had to say. If your experience isnt the same thats fine. Are they really trying to hurt you though? They cannot always recognise the symptoms of anxiety.I said I didnt know if they actually called you a loser. I dont think its okay to call someone a loser ever. You just put it in brackets so I assumed they didnt say that part and that you inferred it from the way they were speaking about you.,socialanxiety,db7cu4r,4,t5_2r22n
10009183,0,t3_5iygx4,I think its more learning the art of covering up your insecurities and anxiety so even if you are quiet you can still feel good and behave cool if you talk a lot you can find a way to not take things too personally. Both is clearly an art but i think some of that is faking it a bit and it seems to constitute indifference  enthusiasm  decisive  relaxed nature....Again try to mimic others that are doing alright!!,socialanxiety,dbc84d2,2,t5_2r22n

10214941,0,t1_dc18wuv,Hey man! Ive been at that point. Didnt have real man tits but like kg to much Im a .cm guy. And I was really uncomfortable with it.Struggled with that for years it made me unattractive and other things but I was more afraid of working out in a gym and people seeing how fat i was and how I wouldnt perform the exercises right then of living with it. So I did nothing.Then during my last year of school due to the lack of any social life and stuff I decided I had to do at least something meaningful in my life playing games programming and watching minute physics all day didnt satisfy anymore it didnt serve any purpose. Then I started running every day in the evening though the fields where no one could see and bother me. I think I started with km really slow and I truly hate running. And i was really bad at it. But at least at the end of the Day I had the feeling that Id done at least one thing that served a purpose on that day. I got better at it started running longer rounds and faster I used one of these running tracking apps they motivate A LOT! Even started to enjoy it sometimes a bit. At the same time I started running I cut back my food intake in retrospective I ate way too less then I should have. Both these things where just hard on a physical level  I was a hungry and b running is hard work. BUT youre not working against your fears in that case so its doable!Fast forward some months later I was still going on a run every day and I partially hated it. But I got better I lost weight and for the first time in my life I ran km. Thinking wow Ive never archived that in my life before was a very good receiving and rewarding thought. Same for  and km.Almost a year later I was down kg at my target. Still had all my other anxieties and shit but my weight wasnt one anymore. Since I started college after that I thought why not join a gym I want to build up muscles and from there on I went at least  times  day and I love it! Since my weight wasnt an issue before and I had a good friend of mine with me who showed me everything anxiety wasnt an issue there the only thing needed was work. And it was sure rewarding I looked better.Now  years later Im comfortable with the way I look  still have most of my other issues only started working on them recently but seriously weight and muscles are the easiest issues to fix that doesnt make it easy I know Ive been there!. I truly believe you can do that too! Sorry for the wall of text thought since Ive been though a similar thing thing that might help. ,socialanxiety,dc1x6dw,1,t5_2r22n

10268348,0,t3_5n1gln,Without knowing more about the specifics of your issues it is a little hard to give advice. However a book that helped me with my self esteem issues was the book Feeling Good by David Burns. It is a very practical Cognitive Behavioral Therapy based book with many strategies to counter intrusive thinking and distorted self perceptions. Probably the most helpful part of the book is the section on cognitive distortions. Or the way that you illogically view situations that lead to feeling bad. Learning these distortions being able to label my negative thoughts and developing ways to challenge and reinterpret my negative thinking has helped a lot. ,socialanxiety,dc7z1z5,1,t5_2r22n

When I do get a job they always find me a great worker the problem is I just get turned down most of the time. Fortunately I work at this awesome place at the moment   Ive been to the doctor for depression and he made me see a therapist. Had  sessions but she and I decided it wasnt for me. I dunno perhaps she was just a bad shrink or it was me. I dont know. I am looking for a new one atm. Hopefully with better results!   I dont know how it is abroad but in the Netherlands those are prescription only and only in bad cases theyre actually prescribed. And I already told you how bad my last appointment went p   Yes and No. Ive got some mates from highschool but I think they might be a bit toxic to me.

You know them and you spend time with them but they are selfish and they lack compassionyou need people in your life who are sensitive and kind. And sometimes that can be really difficult to find in another person. You have yourself though and right now you need to be kind and compassionate towards yourself to help you battle the way that these two assholes are treating you. My best advice ignore them. Forever. Dont hope for it to get betterthey dont deserve your attention anymore. Also people who make fun of other people usually get bored if their target doesnt react. Tell them to leave you alone. Try joining a club or doing some sort of extra curricular activity to find new friends. Be patient with finding new friends and remind yourself often that youre worth being friends with.

Definitely going to be a birthday I will never forget especially since it was a monumental one.I know how sucky it can feel to not have anyone acknowledge you...Makes you realize just how little people actually care about you. I would say try reactivating it and if it makes you feel bad then no harm done just deactivate again.I will say though that once I started college I made a lot of small acquaintances and I made a lot of friends through there.

For higher ups like supervisors a sirmaam will work. You can work in names once youre more comfortable talking to them.For what to say writing a simple script or note cards with the main points could help get it out of your head. Try to limit the amount rewrites to  or  and remind yourself that it doesnt need to be perfect to be effective i know easier said than done.Youve probably heard this one before but it helps me sometimes they are not judging you as much as you are judging yourself. They are not making a list of every verbal stumble or mistake. They have and do make mistakes too.When Im really caught in the what should I dohave done? loops I go to grounding techniques to bring me back to the present moment.

11262220,0,t1_df7pmz6,This is awkward lol. I cant talk to guys I basically talk to girls all the time... And Im a guy. On the other side of the spectrum I think the most important thing to do is to stop worrying about talking to girls. If you pressure yourself into doing so you will come of totally weird and you will punish yourself without even noticing it your brain will make you avoid others to avoid unnatural or uncomfortable moments. As for why you cant get interested into anything new... Well you are inside your comfort zone. Try looking at Improvement Pill videos that deal with Social Anxiety. Theres one that forces you to talk to  people by the end of a month. THATS UUUGE! You might say to yourself but its just  people a day. It can be new people or people you barely talk to. Try to push yourself into unwanted situations those situations will then be more comfortable and next thing you know you are a master at whatever you were afraid of before. A good example would be taking a cold shower. At first its cold as hell and your body resents it like torture second third time in... It becomes somewhat Euphoric The adrenaline within your body and you end up loving it. Start being brave the next couple of days say a little something extra to a cashier or waiter like Have a nice day! people appreciate that and theres no way a waiter will tell you to Famp OFF M. As for your VideoGame Development Club. Talk to others! Say you are developing a shooter as others hey what do you like about CoD or Battlefield? and add that to your game. What do you like about MOBAs? Questions like these will allow you to expand and help you develop a better game win win. P.S. I too am not ugly nor fat etc. Im an average decent guy. I havent had a girlfriend because of fear of commitment and way too picky I hate clingy people emotional people heartless people people that love me too much etc. Its weird. Anyways you will find someone as long as you keep expanding your social life bro. Trust me its going to be fine! D,socialanxiety,df8k108,1,t5_2r22n
11294856,0,t3_6147hq,I thought it was just me but i saw this post I was like this is exactly what Im experiencing! I find it difficult to find the right words when talking to people. Not necessarily afraid to talk to others but more like... my mind blanks out and I mince words. Best metaphor I could find is all the words and sentences are in my head and its locked inside a vault and i cant reach for my words. But then when I was taking meds I had full access to my brain.,socialanxiety,dfc97oy,2,t5_2r22n
11308545,0,t1_dfdobja,While I agree on the sentiment and I respect everything you said here I have one point of contention. Some of us do know how to get rid of SA. I am one of those people. I spent most of my teenage life in my room on my computer away from all the people I thought were so scary. But I broke it for the most part at least. I say this to a lot of people but its important so Ill repeat it here SA is a learned behavior and it takes a lot of time to teach your brain that people should be avoided. But the opposite is also true. You can unlearn SA the same way your learned it. It takes time and a hell of a lot of courage but It can be done Im proof of that. Do I have all the answers? Of course not. But I have buttloads of information and its my goal to help as many people as possible kick this thing for good. Please feel free to message me and ask me questions. I will do whatever I can to help. ,socialanxiety,dfdt1j6,1,t5_2r22n

11313505,0,t3_61esuq,You probably need some psychological help. Maybe look in to spirituality.  Zen meditation is a very good practise to teach you how to control your mind. Its not really fun and it can be difficult to start with but its worth giving a shot. Sit down in a comfy position with a straight back close your eyes and breathe deep and slow breaths through your nose. While doing this try to avoid thinking. Every time a though occurs push it away. Easiest way to do this is to only focus on your breathing. Dont count just focus on each breath without forming any words in your head. A good start is to do this for  min every day and eventually move up to  min.Also this can be a real taboo subject to go in to but I have my experiences and I will give my advice based on them whether people disagree or not.Ive done a lot of LSD which has helped me come out of the worst parts of my depression.I wont condone the use of an illegal substance but I do believe that psychedelics can help with a lot of psychological problems but only if you do A LOT OF RESEARCH! If your mentally ill and I mean you got a real mental disorder you should avoid drugs but if you only suffer from extreme SA I believe there might be some powerful therapeutic effects.People have a lot of different opinions about drugs so do LOTS of research and be as careful as you possibly can be if you ever plan on going that direction.  ,socialanxiety,dfed98y,1,t5_2r22n

11664264,0,t3_668qd7,YES. this is the curse that i have its so hard.  You actively shoot yourself down and you watch it unfold despite sometimes beautiful women giving you attention.  For me i get a point where i shut down and even maintaining eye contact is too hard and it gives me away.  If im in a position where another person is listening to me or paying attention to me while i talk to another person i get visibly uncomfortable. Positive attention makes me shut down.   Its slips through your fingers like quicksand.  its really brutal. The only advice i can give you is to chat up people who are average like grandmas or mailmen or just whoever to make you realize that women who are beautiful are just people.  They are not special.  They if anything are less than special sorry because they get stuff for free and compliments etc.  We are at heart scared because of the random genetic make up of their facebodies which give them extra symmetry.,socialanxiety,dgi5qsr,1,t5_2r22n

11733258,0,t3_670k4o,Im in the same situation but im trying to change. I suggest you to try to change what you have control over for example how your body looks how you dress how you act. I started going to the gym  years ago but i dont follow any particular diet and i still eat junk food but i can tell you even with that it made a really big difference. I found another comfort zone into working out. When you see results you feel further from you anxiety and closer to your life goals. Yeah i could have looked like an Instagram model by now if i was following a proper diet but i dont really have the possibility i will be able to reach my ideal body its just going to take more time and i have it im only  and dedication will do the job. You can make a change as well you can even start working out at home there is a whole category of fitness which focuses on exercises which use your bodywight and no tools. See rbodyweightfitness.
