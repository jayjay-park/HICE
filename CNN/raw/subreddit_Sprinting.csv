Which is what you might need need to leap over things and crash through brush hunting or escaping predators in a forest. k is long distance and Bolts training partner Yohan Blake runs  minutes. You dont run a herd animal to exhaustion over a mile. I read a story of kenyan farmers chasing down a cheetah in the hottest time of day and even that took  miles. Those same farmers might be okay sprinters and who knows what they could do with weight training high protein diet etc but Kenyans and Ethiopians are not known for winning short sprints.

3900081,0,t1_cr0odwf,This is why race is a social construct.  I believe genetics is absolutely a factor in running but what is the black race?  Name me one worldfamous sprinter from Ethiopia or Kenya.  Name me one worldfamous marathon runner from the Caribbean descendants of West African slaves.  Its much easier to name the opposite sprinters from the Caribbean marathoners from East Africa because genetics plays a factor but in terms of race that word includes all of these people into one race.  Dont haha so stupid when people say race is a social construct although some people definitely abuse it.  The constructive thing to do here is separate genetics from race.  Race tries to draw arbitrarily border lines within the space of genetics.  Theres the cliched but true statement that the geographic region with the most genetic diversity is Africa and that may explain how the best sprinters are from one side of the continent while the best marathoners are neighbors from the other side of the continent.  ,Sprinting,cr0udf0,5,t5_2ufk0

6087546,0,t1_cyh8zpn,Re your hips  thats exactly right. Low hips are often a derivative of strong knee lift which you exhibited in the video. I also took into account the cold weather for your modified start. Correcting low hips is often manifested simply by being conscious of hip position. Envisioning your hips coming into alignment with the angle that begins with the back of your head comes down to meet your shoulderblades continues down your back through your tailbone and finally through your hips. Thats essentially the link that the other redditor provided. But heres the thing that diagram really only applies to your drive phase the length of which depends on your event. Basically bro. You dont look bad at all considering the weather modified start and all the clothes you were wearing. I liked your knee lift but remember not to sacrifice your forward momentum lean for high knees.
