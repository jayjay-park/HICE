278245,0,t3_1xaduj,A couple general rules apply When the beer arrives at the distributor it is supposed to be ready for consumption to the brewers expectations for what the beer is supposed to be.  Aging generally diminishes fresh hop aroma and flavor and though slow oxidative processes brings out dark fruit flavor plum raisin etc. This is more commonly done with big beer high ABV styles such as barleywines. It gets trickier with anything fermented with brettanomyces because that type of yeast is known for producing all kinds of strange aromatic and flavor compounds that make those beers so unique. Generally a brett beer will have already been fermented for a much longer period of time to facilitate the ethanol oxidation to acetic acid potential of the yeast. You may find that continuing to age it will take this balance past its prime and into excessively sour territory. That being said I havent tried that particular beer so Im not conversant with what it tastes like fresh therefore its more difficult to speculate what it might taste like if cellared for awhile. You could try contacting the brewery theyre usually pretty good about responding to customers. ,mainebeer,cf9lpff,2,t5_2tdot
