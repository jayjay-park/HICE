9515098,0,t1_d9l79w2,Okay dude.  Here is what I got for youThree card spread.  Leaving the present situation of Queen of Pentacles.  You are in a good situation now.  You have plenty.  However......The next card is for November.  I drew The Devil.  I dont how other Tarot readers feel about this card.  But for me it is nothing but evil.  Specifically it is saying that you will have an adversary or something fighting against you this month. Now I drew a card on top of The Devil asking Who is The Devil? and I drew the King of Wands.  He is the accomplishment the fulfillment of energy and action the MadeMan.  I am not sure what to make of this.  It says to me someone who is accomplished is working against you.  But I am not going to say that you have an enemy unless you know that you do and instead link this to the Queen of Pentacles drawn earlier.  The Devil may very well be the accomplished you working against yourself to your own detriment.Now all that being said all of this changes in December.  here you have The World.  A card of plenty and fulfillment.  Whatever happens in November you will come out of it richer.  After all this I decided to try a new technique Discovering the underlying power in the situation by drawing the bottom card of the deck.  Here I drew the Nine of Swords.  It is you and your incessant drive to win that is the driving power of these events.  Take that as you will.  You will come out well in the end.  Essentially you have a three act play going on here.  Act  All is well and you are in a position of wealth.  Act  is the struggle and conflict.  Act  You come out on top and successful.  ,ConsulttheTarot,d9lxsv3,1,t5_3gs31
