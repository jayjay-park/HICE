6710848,0,t1_d0d7k1e,. What Id recommend you is to take short QampA like flashcards notes of your wrong questions on Word or something and review them every now and then. Also if theres something you consider really important not some insignificant detail that can help you to distinguishdiagnoseidentify a disease better or differentiate it from other take a oneliner.. After finishing this pass of UW try to do another qbank and then do a second pass of UW in your dedicated. If you want to master FA do Rx. If you want another set of good questions some of them with trivial stuff go for Kaplan. Go for both if time allows.. Anatomy is kinda difficult to predict in the real deal they can ask you literally anything! FAUW is a great place to start. If youre still struggling after that skim through a bigger book like Kaplan BRS or HY. In my medschool teachers love classic books like Rouvire and Testut so studying anatomy with real clinical application instead of just descriptive stuff was a big deal! ,step1,d0dgjho,1,t5_37lrc

7760541,0,t3_4lknqx,. I think it took me  hours to go through a UWorld block. As long as you have enough days to finish the Qbank... I dont think this is a problem. I preferred timedrandom. The reason for this is that sometimes on UW doing subject only you can guess the answer by the fact that you can eliminate other answers based on the fact they are from a different system. On the other hand if its working for you.. just keep doing it.. It is a passive process unless you make it active. Id make anki cards on any details I needed to know from the answer explanations and then do them at the end of the day. Then again a week later.,step1,d3oban9,2,t5_37lrc

7907539,0,t3_4nkcs0,Dear umtu Thank you for your post. Your offer is greatly appreciated.Instead of sending you a PM I am posting my NBME scores and UW progression as a comment because I think your assessment of my needs could be helpful to other students. I have  days of studying including today before I take my Step  on Friday June th. Here goesHere is an imgur album with screenshots that summarizes my entire UWorldUWSANBME performance    correct School administered CBSE  months out  correct on the Free   weeks out  correct on nd school CBSE  weeks out  correct on NBME  . weeks out  on UWSA  weeks out Too good to be true. I wish this wasnt inflated.  correct on NBME   days out UGH I knew UWSA was too good to be true.  correct on NBME   days out. Crap. Why are my scores declining??  st pass of UW  started  s ended at high ss on each block. A better representative would be the past moving average of my unused random blocks which ended at around . The plan UWorld Today Saturday  Wednesday. Finish my now  marked UWorld questions then followed by whatever questions I still got incorrect estimating lt which means  total questions and  days of review including today.  day for UWSA Monday and  day for rapid review.First Aid Over this week I plan to do  Groovernaculums anki deck of the First Aid rapid review section  a great resource freely available on ugroovernaculums user page  and I will quickly reread the First Aid Rapid Review section again on the day before my exam Thursday memorizing any formulae. Pathoma and Sketchy I already did  passes of Pathoma and a whole pass of sketchy. Im focusing on Uworld and First aid on this final stretch before judgement day.Is a score of  too unrealistic? What should I do to achieve it? It feels within my reach but my recent NBME scores have been very disheartening.Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. I am interested in your tutoring but Im not sure how I can squeeze in any more time. I virtually have each hour planned out for the next  days.Thank you so much!,step1,d44vrx7,1,t5_37lrc

8714560,0,t3_4zdtbf,I dont know if they are updated.That being said the Pathoma lectures are some of the best study resources out there and not particularly expensive for what you are getting. If you use the ripped videos you are not getting the outline text which is great for following along the vids and annotating and you are stealing. When it comes to big textbook publishers who price gouge I can rationalize it a bit. But with Pathoma you are screwing a great companyprofessor that works hard for the benefit of us med students. People purchasing the videos is what keeps the price as low as it is.,step1,d6uyhmx,12,t5_37lrc
9009150,0,t3_517tw0,Congratulations on a great score! I believe we are the same in that I learn more through questions as well. I would like to know if you started uworld in the beginning of MSII or if you saved it for dedicated period. Would you recommend starting uworld now?Also when did you start studying for step ? How long did you study for? What would you recommend i do now to prepare for taking my boards next year? Sorry for all the questions im just a very naive and confused msII,step1,d7urbxv,1,t5_37lrc

11159014,0,t1_dewpcp7, here. I remember getting to  incorrect when I got home from the test and then giving up counting.  Theres really no way of knowing though.. Of course theres rumors about questions being experimental or thrown out.,step1,dewv1sx,2,t5_37lrc
11240530,0,t3_60f5mi,I bet those Sonys would do the trick however I just wanted to make sure you noticed that they have a ft cord. Of course you can wrap it up but Ive had headphones with long cords in the past and they were always more difficult. If youre studying in a library or with others around you make sure you get a pair with closed back. The two you chose do have closed backs so maybe Im preaching to the choir. Closed backs will prevent your sound from leaking and bothering those around you and it will also improve the sound isolation if youre studying in a noisy area.Personally I have the Ohm version of the Beyerdynamic DTs and I can highly recommend them. If theyre definitely out of your price range take a look over at HeadFi for reviews and the forums also have lots of great information. There are lots of great options in the  range.,step1,df63j1d,1,t5_37lrc

11738678,0,t1_dgpnuan,Make sure you go through those incorrects.  is a solid first pass. Honestly cant say bc NBME is your best predictor. You clearly have mastered the foundations so yeah I think  is within your reach but I have no data points to make an accurate prediction so just take nbme  or    week out Id say avoid  or just dont take the score too seriously bc its a hard ass form,step1,dgqlxsa,1,t5_37lrc
11739812,0,t1_dgqq647,Yeah you gotta delay if you are shooting for . On your second pass you should be close to s for  range. It seems to me like theres some large fundamental gaps in your knowledge that can drastically improve if you spend these next  weeks focusing on hammering away at these areas of weaknesses. UWSAs tend to overpredict so right now I think youre looking at the  range which is much lower than what you want. Definitely delay your test and figure out why you are missing things  do you just not know enough? are you making a ton of silly mistakes? are you reading questions carefully and actually answering the question? is there one particular area thats just destroying you??Find out the answer to those questions work on those areas and your score should bump up.
