Since e.g.  is not in the range it is strict.The why is that infinite sets are weird. They are so vastly bigger than finite sets that it we have to add a lot of new stuff to make them bigger.

172253,0,t3_1w0dyu,I can speak here as both a longtime math professor and a longtime Linux user.  There are both practical and historical reasons for math people to prefer Linux.  On the practical side Linux is highly configurable in ways that Windows or Mac users would find dizzying but those math people who are technically proficient tend to be inveterate tinkerers so we actually like the configurability.  As others have pointed out for programming tasks and such this can lead to a significant productivity boost.  But that leaves the historical reasons many of which can be traced directly back to Donald Knuth.  You see since the late s the best way to write nicelooking math for publication has been Knuths TeX typesetting software with its myriad importable packages and more recent derived software like MathJax.  But until around  TeX was primarily Unix software.  Similar things can be said about CAS software like Mathematica and Maple which started with Unix software like Macsyma and MATLAB.  For a long time the only way to do serious numerical analysis was on Unix.  Then just as the software like TeX started appearing on smaller platforms because the smaller platforms were improving enough to support them Unix also started appearing on smaller platforms anyone else here remember Amiga? so there was no need to learn something new in order to keep doing the same work.,math,cey1vyx,6,t5_2qh0n

203930,0,t1_cf1nv4u,Okay. Im still not quite sure I understand what you are trying to do but I think what you want is convex combinationsA convex combination of three points xampnbspy xampnbspy and xampnbspy is a pointampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspxampnbspampnbspxampnbspampnbspxampnbspyampnbspampnbspyampnbspampnbspywhere ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp and ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp.In your case the points xampnbspy xampnbspy and xampnbspy are the three vertices of the triangle. A convex combination is the geometric equivalent of a weighted average think of ampnbsp andampnbsp as weights for the corresponding vertices. If all of the weights are equal thatampnbspis ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp then the convex combination will be the center of the triangle the centroid Increasing one of the weights and decreasing the others to keep the sum of the weights equal toampnbsp will move the convex combination closer to the corresponding vertex. If one of the weights isampnbsp and the other two areampnbsp then the convex combination will actually be one of the vertices.Now maybe the weights youre using dont add up toampnbsp they add up to some other number. You say in your original post that youre using numbers between  andampnbsp for example. Thats fine. As long as all of your weights are nonnegative you can just divide each weight by the total of all of them to get a set of weights that add up toampnbsp. This process is called normalization. Then you can use those normalized weights as the values of ampnbsp andampnbsp and thereby compute the x and ycoordinates of the corresponding point in the triangle.To go the other direction from a point in the triangle to a set of normalized weights you just set up a system of equations. Suppose the point in the triangle has coordinates xampnbspy. Then you have the equations xampnbspampnbspxampnbspampnbspxampnbspampnbspx yampnbspampnbspyampnbspampnbspyampnbspampnbspy ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp.Note that the only unknowns here are ampnbsp andampnbsp. The values of xampnbspandampnbspy are the known coordinates of the point in the triangle and the values of xampnbspx x y y andampnbspy are the known coordinates of the vertices of the triangle. So you have a system of three linear equations with three unknowns which means you can solve for the values of ampnbsp andampnbsp.Then if you want you can scale the normalized weights up to any desired range by just multiplying all of them by the same factor. If you want all of the weights to be in the range ampnbsptoampnbsp for example just multiply all of the normalized weights byampnbsp.Now as I said Im not quite sure I understand what you are trying to do. It sounds to me that you want to take a set of weights convert those weights to a point in the triangle perform some geometric operation to move the point somewhere else in the triangle and then convert that point back to a set of weights. What Ive described here will allow you to do the first and last step via convex combinations.,math,cf1o6aq,5,t5_2qh0n

Now you do some integrals and magically E | thetathetajs |  lt E | thetabartheta| with strictness for some value of theta.The problem is that in addition to this holding for the process XYZ it would also hold for any translation of the same process e.g. XYZ... so this gives another pair of of points but if apply the inverse translation to that estimator you end up with a different JS estimator.So the JS estimator is objectively better if you shrink to  or  or wherever the heck you want. It seems the grass is always greener than barXbarYbarZ and it further turns out that the JS estimator is itself inadmissable  meaning there are other estimators that are objectively better than it.So I still dont really get it.,math,cf92h0s,1,t5_2qh0n

Ive changed your priors slightly and Im not saying this simple model would be useful for discovering the truth.Random variables pi the ith passenger can be normal n smuggler s or bomber b. di the ith passengers documents are fake two of these are observed to be true but lets call it one because the events arent independent the rest observed to be false. e the plane had critical engine failure t the plane was taken down by terrorists c the plane crashed observed to be trueIn case you arent familiar with the notation when one of the binary variables is used in an equation it can either refer to it being true and a  prefix is used to refer to it being false or it can refer to both truth and falsity either as a dummy variable eg summed over or as a free variable appearing on both sides of an equation.We want to calculate pt|cdi.  t is either true or false t so we have pt|cdi  ptcdiptcdiptcdi and its sufficient for us to calculate ptcdi and ptcdi.ptcdi  sumpisumeprodi pdi|pipt|pipc|te.A tool such as SamIAm free to download can do this calculation but this problem is simple enough to do be hand if we make some approximations.pc|te is zero if both t and e are false and the rest of the expression is negligible if both t and e are true its unlikely that youd have both engine failure and terrorists.  We can therefore make the following approximations. ptcdi  sumpiprodi pdi|pipt|pipc|te. ptcdi  sumpiprodi pdi|pipt|pipc|te.This sum simplifies as follows.  pt|pi is negligible unless some pib ppib|di is negligible and ppin|di is negligible.  It follows that the following approximations are good. sumpiprodi pdi|pipt|pi  pdj|pjb sumpiprodi pdi|pipt|pi  pdj|pjswhere j is the passenger with the fake passport.Substituting these approximations back into our original formula givespt|cdi  pdj|pjbpc|tepdj|pjbpc|tepdj|pjspc|te.,math,cfy5o42,3,t5_2qh0n

511072,0,t1_cfy9ss3,To give you an intuitive nontechnical sense of why theyre so physically important think about how awkward it would be to do math involving things moving backward without negative numbers. Similarly complex numbers are related to the concept of rotation. You can see how this would be relevant to a LOT of things but it goes further. Since a circle is just a point rotated around  its also described by complex numbers. And since anything that repeats itself can be thought of as being controlled by a point traveling on the perimeter of a circle imaginary numbers are also related to anything that cycles including waves. So they really are everywhere. ,math,cfyd15v,30,t5_2qh0n
511500,0,t3_1zzftd,That they have to be all different makes it a bit easier. The method is this write every type of card hand you can form to get it value wise calculate how many hands of that value distribution you can make given the various card proportions then divide by the total number of  card hands to get a probability.                             you get the idea                        Thereby there are  possible hands with  differentvalued cardsWhere by  I mean a  card hand with a card costing one two three four in whichever order. I hope Im not forgetting to divide by some symmetric factor.  In total there are             ie the number of choosings of  amongst  C card hands you can make.  Dividing those two numbers one gets a chance of . corrected value thanks DemeisterampneeduhLee to get the bonus. I may be wrong somewhere in the derivation but the value comforts me in that its a nice enough probability to give this kind of event presumably the game makers have thought about this.  Ah yes this is assuming a full pack to begin with. Obviously later on in the game the statistic gets harder to estimate.  To note by independence of the various events regroupingreordering some factors together you get an alternate derivation.Start with the  hand you have a probability of  to draw a   to get   to get   to get  multiply all those together and again by ! to show that a permutation of these hands are also valid and you get precisely the first term in my calculation so I believe this is correct. Edit Ha yes I forgot about a few combinations I guess I should have counted them there are simply C of them. The result should be ok now.EDIT Dang the total space size was also copied down wrong.

513057,0,t1_cfyib4y,Du Sautoy isnt the best at describing maths in my opinion. He tries to romanticise the concept of numbers when real mathematics has very little to do with the properties of specific numbers. He also seems to spend far too much effort in reinforcing the stereotype that mathematicians are people that just multiply very large integers together or memorise as many digits of obscure irrationals as possible or even worse try and invent complicated formulae as if a collection of symbols on paper is the beauty of the mathematics instead of the theorem they belong to or the situation they model.His presentation of the material is much more like Brian Cox than Carl Sagan in that he knows about his subject very well hes a world expert after all and yet chooses to dumb down the material so much that people arent learning anything more than some inaccurate obfuscation of the actual ideas hes trying to present.Its possibly the fault of the production teams that he works with and I dont know how much input he actually has with the writing on his shows but I just feel his idea of the base level amount of knowledge that the general scienceinterested public has is far lower than reality.,math,cfyl5ud,4,t5_2qh0n
514295,0,t3_1zzyfp,Rational functions i.e. ratios of polynomials form a field.  Youve surely seen these in calculus and the partial fraction decomposition of them is an important structural aspect beyond the setting of integration.Polynomials in several variables over R or C are important in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. One basic property of them is that the polynomials in a fixed number of variables over R or C have unique factorization and to prove that the simplest way is to use induction on the number of variables to prove a stronger theorem if A has unique factorization then AX has unique factorization. The way to prove that is to first replace A with its field of fractions K and note KX has unique factorization because it has a division algorithm and then use some relations between AX and KX to deduce unique factorization in AX from that in KX and A. In this way fields play an important intermediate role even if the result itself may not be directly about fields per se.,math,cfyq8lf,2,t5_2qh0n

589401,0,t3_20uilu,Theres a lot of fantastic answers here and you should definitely take a look at universal algebra and operads.       One striking result is that a structure with two operations that respect eachother and commute with eachother actually only has a single operation this is the EckmannHilton argument. Here is the argument in a pictureEdit Oops I see DepravedManInky already mentioned thisThe picture shows a structure with two compatible group operations which are depicted as horizontal and vertical. You can read the diagram as telling you that horizontal and vertical operations are equal and both commutative.    This says that something with two compatible group operations is just a commutative group one could say a group object in the category of groups is an abelian group. More generally and this is the subject of universal algebra you can consider internalising algebraic theories in other categories. For instance a ring is a monoid object in the category of abelian groups.    The example of Hopf algebras is another good one its a cogroup object in the category of algebras or a group object in the category of coalgebras.    This gives you a way of having objects with multiple structures but it imposes complete compatibility of the operations.,math,cg79ors,1,t5_2qh0n

Even if learning history also teaches you other skills that does not imply that the reason high school students are required to take history is to learn those other skills.To bring this back to the original subject I think its rather reasonable to say that the reason high school students should take mathematics is for the content of those courses. That is I dont see anything wrong with thinking that people with a high school diploma should have the basic numeracy skills taught in high school math classes. We should require these classes to be taught because we want high school graduates to have these skills.

810414,0,t3_23f3gp,I admit Im a bit fuzzy on the technical details of the separation of variables. I always thought one needs to appeal to some other theorem to show that the particular solutions you find are a complete system. For example by using the StoneWeierstrass Theorem. Another example would be the fact that one can show the completeness of the sine and cosine functions with appropriate periods using          sumi fraci  fracpi           This is backwards from the way I originally learned it. I originally learned how to prove this using Fourier methods. However I recently read some of a textbook the name escapes me but Ill try to remember where they show completeness necessary for Fourier from the sum formula. Of course its important to realize that the sum can be proven by other means.Again Im a bit fuzzy on the details. Maybe there is a more encompassing theorem that helps out?

Thats as close to this sort of thing as weve had in recent years.  Long long ago of course there were emotional arguments over things like complex numbers but math is sort of interesting in that it sorts these disputes out on its own.  Complex numbers turned out to be really useful.  Quaternions less so but still to some people I guess.  Irrational numbers which allegedly got one of Pythagorass students killed are around whether we like them or not.One thing that still shows up today is the divide between pure and applied mathematics and the relationship is definitely one of trust and understanding.  Pure mathematicians dont trust applied mathematicians and applied mathematicians dont understand pure mathematicians.  Ive seen plenty of grad students arguing over this sort of thing before though the professors on different sides of this debate dont interact much.  Its still relevant because applied math has started to get such a giant share of all funding these days and more and more people are working with scientists and engineers.Theres definitely a dark side to this as partnerships with engineering departments lead invariably to the engineers attempting to get math classes to use inferior engineeroriented textbooks.,math,ch1n910,4,t5_2qh0n

869375,0,t3_242olu,Full disclosure Im also a student taking D differential geometry trying to make sure I have this down by explaining it here.For a D surface in D space you cant visualize dN the derivative of the Gauss map called dNp dN IIp or II in various texts as a vector like you can the Gauss map since dN will be a x matrix. However I find the best way to intuit dN is to imagine it in a specific direction. The Gauss map itself takes a surface and maps each point onto a sphere at the point where the tangent planes are the same. If youre good at picturing this imagine travelling along a short path on a curved surface and then travelling along the Gauss maps image of that path. Some things to notice  If the curvature along that path bows out away from the normal vector youll end up moving along the Gauss image on the sphere in the same direction.  If the curvature bows in toward the normal vector youll end up moving along the Gauss image in the opposite direction.  If the surface is bowed outin a lot in that direction youll move quickly along the Gauss image.  If the surface is relatively flat in that direction youll move slowly along the Gauss image. If the path is straight you wont move along the Gauss map.So intuitively the rate of change of the Gauss map in a certain direction while moving in that same direction tells you the curvature of the surface in that direction. The upperleft and lowerright entries of dN are defined by doing this in the two directions of the parameterization of your surface. For a parametrization Xuvgt S these entries are Xuun and XvvnI cant currently give you an intuitive grasp on the other entries of this matrix since I dont have one myself. I do know they are equal and defined as Xuvn and Xvun but thats hardly intuition. If someone wants to jump in and offer some relief pitching on this subject Id be grateful!What I can tell you is that when you diagonalize dN something remarkable comes out. You now have two nonzero entries which are the curvatures not in some arbitrary directions but in the maximal and minimal directions of curvature of your surface and these directions are always perpendicular. For a saddle point one direction will bow out an the other will bow in. For an elliptical point one direction will have the maximal curvature and the other will have the minimal curvature. These two curvatures along with the maximal curvatures direction are the only  things you need to know to know everything about the surface locally around that point. The product of these two curvatures K is the Gaussian curvature of the surface. K by Gausss Remarkable Theorem is invariant under isometry.Hopefully thats somewhat helpful it certainly was for me.

Red is the frequentist approach using hypothesis testing at the  confidence level.  The xaxis is the probability of the coin giving heads after a flip.  The yaxis is the weighted sum over all possible k of the chance of surviving given the strategys choice for that value of k and the value of p.

I find it really hard to believe that you would work through the books by Kunen or Jech in set theory or by David Marker in Model theory or by Downey and Hirschfeldt in computability theory and say that you had been doing philosophy rather than mathematics.

994571,0,t1_chh9l90,You can define more general weighted norms like  ltxygtS  x S xWhere S is some matrix.  For instance if S is diagonal it weights each element of the vector.   So if you have vectors where the scale of the first component is magnitudes off the scale of the second then a weighted norm can be useful to normalize your vector. As an easy example think of calculating the center of mass of n particles which is a weighted inner product. X M mx  ...  mnxn so define ltmxgt  mT W m.  Where W has M along the diagonal. ,math,chhc8uy,1,t5_2qh0n

994723,0,t1_chhbuwp,Well infinite precision is possible mathematically  for instance with the discrete logistic map you just get a sequence of nastier and nastier fractions which of course have infinite precision. But if we consider a physical phenomenon as a computation there cannot be infinite precision.  For instance specular reflection of a ball hitting a wall will never reflect with precisely the incoming angle.  So if you imagine a ball bouncing around in a box microscopic imperfections will cause a perturbation in each reflection and you wont get the periodic solution.  It will look statistically like a chaotic trajectory. So I guess thats my question.  How can you tell background scattering from an intrinsic chaotic rule if we measure things like turbulence statistically.  Another take   We observe a periodic wave with noise.Is this an oscillator with random noise  or is it an attractor with random drift? ....sort of like randomly jumping and getting pulled to the ground will look like an oscillation.  ornsteinuhlenbeck process,math,chhcv9b,3,t5_2qh0n

1105914,0,t3_26s8sz,Honours theses are a weird animal. Its not really set in stone what makes a good thesis. In my experience there are two ways students usually go . using the opportunity to learn an advanced topic where there thesis would involve a survey of results in that area and examples of typical problems and solutions or . applying known undergradlevel techniques to new problems. Both have their merits since you can either get a jump on grad school with a new topic or potentially get some decent research done that will prepare you for the thesis part of the mastersPhD if you decide to go that route. To all my students I suggest  unless they can convince me that they  sure they will enjoy the research part of grad school. It gives you a minitaste of what being a mathematician does for a living and therefore is a good test of whether you would really enjoy a career in academia. I know this was general and not cryptospecific but hopefully it can at least get you to narrow down when type of thesis youd like to do. ,math,chtzzpx,14,t5_2qh0n

1166246,0,t1_ci0s6dh,If youre in Rthat is the vector space which most closely resembles the dimensional world that we live inthen the determinant of a matrix is in absolute value the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the columns of the matrix. You can think of this as telling you something about how the matrix acts on the unit cube M takes the unit cube to this new parallelepiped with volume |detM|. The idea of volume here generalizes to more dimensions in the following way we identify the things wed like to preserve for the idea of higher dimensional volume and see if we can come up with a function that gives us those characteristics. The properties that we want to keep are. When we scale the parallelepiped by a factor of k along any dimension the volume scales by k as well. Let me rephrase this since the original is incomplete. The volume of the parallelepiped is linear in its length along any dimension. So when increase the length of the parallelepiped from l to klm the resulting volume is equal to the volume of k copies of the original parallelepiped plus a parallelepiped with length m along that dimension equal to m and other dimensions equal to those dimensions in the original.. A degenerate flat parallelepiped which arises when two of the columns are the same has volume .. The unit cube has volume .Miraculously once these are formalized there is exactly one function which satisfies these three requirements the determinant. ,math,ci0tm4n,9,t5_2qh0n

1185332,0,t1_ci2t8u2,Im not TheAntiRudin but I personally really dislike the common take on Lockharts Lament seen in this subreddit. As a practitioner of mathematics there are certainly things in math I find beautiful. However I feel that appealing to beauty is a very poor defense of mathematics. For one beauty is very subjective. There are parts of math I dont find beautiful that others do and the parts of math I find beautiful arent seen as such by all mathematicians. Further people in other disciplines find aesthetic value in their work. For example consider Sagans Cosmos. Defending math by calling it an art is only convincing to people who already value mathematics who are exactly the people you dont need to convince!I think that the value of math vaguely stated is the same as the value of other theoretical fields mathematics is in the business of producing truths. Referring to math as art undersells its truthproducing role. It conjures an analogy to things like   the Mona Lisa Der Erlknig etc. While those things certainly have value they arent the same sort of thing as e.g. the theorem that no computable axiomatization of integer arithmetic is complete. While I think that this is a beautiful theorem it wasnt proven because Gdel thought it was beautiful but rather to answer previously raised questions and to better understand a certain phenomenon.Understanding the value of mathematics this way its perfectly fine that some people wont ever use much math in their lives and that some people dont find mathematics interestingbeautifuletc. I personally dont find molecular biology interesting but I understand its value in producing certain truths.

If CS formalizes algorithms how is that not math? If you define what an algorithm is and give rules to construct and reason about them what else to call that but a mathematical formalization? Scientific fields are not mutually exclusive and were never meant to be.There are formalisms other than set theory which do not talk about sets. E.g. category theory type theoryStill even if you defined everything using sets youre not going to achieve much if every time you talk about a number you see it as a set.

1210324,0,t1_ci5qr3x,I see now that the original intent both OPs and yours was not a pedagogical explanation. Nevertheless its not so clear to me that symmetry of i ddx is what integration by parts really is. For example explaining the apparent discrepancy between the basic formula and your inner product formulation where did the boundary terms go? requires a rather delicate discussion of selfadjoint extensions which is beyond the scope of even a solid basic functional analysis course since it only concerns unbounded operators. All this seems like an awful lot of machinery to get to the bottom of a very simple formula. Besides the spectral theory of iddx is entirely trivial and only serves as a textbook example confirming that the framework we have built up to deal with harder situations works as expected.I understand things are completely opposite in other areas but my general philosophy for analysis is that in most instances concepts actually take the backseat compared to techniquesproofs. Rather than synthesize observations into abstract ideas you can more easily relate to each other I have found it more useful to acquire computational intuition about certain tools say fixed point theorems and adapt them to whatever situation I am dealing with from the  basic Banach fixed point theorem all the way to reinterpretations of Hoermanders Newton method version of the NashMoser theorem using pseudodifferential calculus.,math,ci5s2yd,1,t5_2qh0n

1332092,0,t3_29c236,I dont think that continuity for general topological spaces is intuitive because there are always strange topological spaces. The definition of continuity was made because it is useful and it agrees with the intuitive idea when working with nice spaces like metric spaces. In this way it is like compactness which at first seems very strange and not useful but after working awhile with topological spaces you see how nice of a property compactness is. It is often times easier to use the open sets definition than the epsilon delta definition since you dont have to rely on the exact distance between points. If f  X gt Y is a map of topological spaces then f is continuous if and only if for any neighborhood N of fx there exists a neighborhood M of x such that M is contained in f N. Since the neighborhoods dictate how close points are this is effectively saying that no matter how close we choose to be to fx we can find some set of points that are close to x that get mapped that close to fx. But since the neighborhoods can be somewhat arbitrarily defined this wont always be intuitive. ,math,cijh6n7,2,t5_2qh0n

1459352,0,t1_ciz4ekx,Type theory was introduced in order to avoid the paradoxes with naive set theory pointed out by Russel f.e. S|S is not element of S. The type theory is also originally by Russel by not making sets the foundation.Instead of using sets type theory tags each term with an extra thing called the type and introduces a formalism for types that restricts or type checks operations in order to prevent you from saying things like S|S is not element of S initially by making a hierarchy of types and letting you only use the types lower than X as elements of something at type level X but later much extended.The formalism contains judgements which list the type that you would get if you had such a term like   nat.Then there are some rules in the formalism that tell what type the resulting term would have after you did some operation.Type theory is supposed to replace set theory and classical logic as the foundation.Say per definition natural numbers are a type called nat with at least an inhabitant   nat and a function succ  nat gt nat this means that succ expects a nat and gives you back a nat. No mention of sets anywhere here see? Here you can also given just one reduction rule in the type system state what type things like succsucc end up with namely nat.You then can actually build the natural numbers for example by Church numeralsLet nat be the type for very specific functions of s and z. The body of the functions depend on which number each function is supposed to represent.s stands for the actual successor function which is never replaced never actually given.z stands for the actual zero presumably function which is never replaced never actually given.Let sz  zYou can Let sz  sz Let sz  ssz Let sz  sssz ... but its not usually done manually. But you can see the idea better that way.Let succnsz  nssz. n stands for natural number but will actually be a function where succ  nat gt nat.Then Let sz  succsz Let sz  succsz etcetc.As you can see youll want to just hide the extra s and z if possible so you getLet   succLet   succ  succsuccand thus say what the arabic numerals actually mean.Note that   nat and succ  nat.Note succ is not s. Think of s and z as the inner machinery or what natural numbers actually do or need in order to work properly and of succ and  etcetc of what you want to use natural numbers for once you do have them and nat to be the total requirementsThus you have all natural numbers working just using functions. You can do predecessor addition subtraction multiplication exponentiation comparison ... similarily without adding more parameters beyond s and z to n  nat. In a similar way you can do everything true and false just introduce parameters t and f that you never fill logical operations pairs sets ..... This is sufficient as a foundation of everything.However maybe there are nicer representation of numbers the above gets unwieldy once you are at the complex numbers for example by the field axioms. So you can represent those instead. In this way you can encode whatever you want.What is the homotopy part about?Edit Hmm needs more types...So the same for the logical operationsLet truetf  tLet falsetf  fLet orabtf  atbtfwhere true  bool false  bool a  bool b  bool or  bool bool gt bool sometimes bool gt bool gt bool in some variants.Here there is supposed to be no way to get from nat to bool right now even though the functions look mighty similar two parameters sz vs. tf. Only once you have a function like lt  nat nat gt bool there is supposed to be a way but just through there.,math,ciz7e02,7,t5_2qh0n

1607370,0,t1_cjhrhy2,Also I wasnt  careful about the modeling of the two processes and wrote the above as if the first ticket happened instantly. More reasonable would be to model her arrival on the scene as one random process and then the handing out of tickets as another.Basically you can count her arrival as one process with rate lambda. Once she arrives the arrival time of each ticket is governed by the faster rate  lambda  and there will be  n  cars including yours eligible for tickets so the average arrival time of a ticket to any one car will be  nlambda . Combining these two waiting times your average wait time for a ticket is then fraclambda  fracnlambda ...though this still assumes that  n  is known in advance.Edit more details...The rate of expirations could be estimated from the cars with expired meters and no tickets... though this will miss cars who have already left when you come by. Assuming none have and that the meter maid ticketed all eligible cars before leaving the rate of meter expirations is governed by  lambda  expirations per minute. This would be estimated by number of expired without tickets divided by time window between last ticket and your arrival.At last we have reached most of the way to a coherent model. Suppose you park and put no time on the meter so it is instantly expired. At this time there are already  n  cars around with expired meters. You expect to wait  lambda  minutes for the meter maid to arrive during which time  n  lambdalambda  additional cars are expected to have expired meters. Ignoring the possibility of additional cars being added to the expired pool your expected time to a ticket is then fraclambda  fracn  nlambda  fraclambda  fracn  fraclambdalambdalambda All that remains is to estimate the lambdas from the information you described. Of course the average wait time will actually be slightly longer than this because we underestimate  n  and  lambda . That and the whole model has to be taken with a grain of salt because Poisson processes are memoryless so her having just left does not decrease the likelihood of her coming back which is not entirely realistic.,math,cjhryxi,1,t5_2qh0n

In mathematical statistics the proof of leastsquares regression the Fisher exact test ANOVA Root Mean Square Error and more all operate on squared quantities. Deeply the realvalue answer at the top explains that this is because xx is smooth so it ameliorates the theory for leastsquares regression and it is right. But thats not exactly watercooler talk in biological research.

1887791,0,t3_2g8llh,I already know LaTeX so Im biased because I wouldnt have to learn it for this but I think LaTeX is a much better solution for any big project. The major benefit is not in regards to typing math either in my opinion although so much of mathematical formatting is done completely for free in LaTeX.The major benefit as I see it is that a markup language allows you to separate formatting concerns from content concerns. So when youre writing content you are completely free of worrying about formatting and vice versa. With a WYSIWYG word processor Ive never felt those things are divorced because youre pressured to simultaneously deal with both. With LaTeX you can type all the content you want in plain text and make macros and parameters as you go that you can fine tune when you are in the mood to worry about layout. EDIT Let me just give a little example of what I mean. Lets say you want your definitions to be formatted a particular way. In Word at least the very unadvanced amount of Word I know you would have to commit to how very early on and if you change your mind youre going to have a lot of work ahead of you. Its also quite easy to forget sometimes what youve chosen and maybe you italicize once instead of bold. In LaTeX this is not a thing. All you would do is make a macro defdfn and then every time you have a word like this you can just use the macro ...the dfnslope of a line is.... Now later you decide oh I really want this to pop off the page lets make it bold. So you just change one line defdfnbf  and now theyre all bold. You decide oh I want a special index just for definitions. No problem. You make your dfn macro a little more complicated and add the word and the page number to a token list or something and you print those things out on a special page at the end or maybe theres a LaTeX package for doing something like this. Anyway the point is you didnt have to think about it right away your work will look more consistent and if later you can change your mind or make things better with almost minimal effort.,math,ckgo5kk,26,t5_2qh0n

Again there is an exception When you plan to eventually divide by the same very large number you need to keep track of any leftover factors.One common trick for manipulating very large numbers is to take the logarithm.  This operation turns a very large number into an ordinary large number which is much more familiar and can be manipulated more straightforwardly.

Isnt that always what we are doing in some sense? However information and black holes is a really cool topic. The reason for black holes having the maximum information density is very simple if you cram a lot of stuff into a small volume eventually itll get dense enough to collapse into a black hole! And anything you add after that will just increase the size of the black hole. Further the entropy which is a measure of the amount of information of a black hole is not proportional to its volume but rather to its surface area. So the maximal information contained in a certain volume of space seems to grow with its surface area not with its volume which if you think about is very surprising. In a sense it also means that a description of the surface area will be enough to recreate everything inside the full volume and this is what we call holography. And there is actually many cool examples that shows how this works where a complicated theory in d dimensions seems to be exactly the same as a simpler theory in d dimension. ,math,cl3v4dn,19,t5_2qh0n

2198114,0,t3_2k9nu8,Heres how I interpreted and approached your question let v be a vector. Find  x in R  xv is perpendicular to v .If youre familiar with the dot product then you may know that two vectors v and w are orthogonal if and only if their dot product is zero and orthogonality is basically the same thing as perpendicularity.So if v is a vector then when is xv perpendicular to v? That is when is the dot product of v with xv ? Well in general v.xv  xv.v  x|v|. If v is not the zero vector then theres only one way for this dot product to be zero we must have x.This is a degenerate case but with this interpretation the zero vector is orthogonalperpendicular to every vector. Your solution set would therefore be  instead. This is a bit technical so  may be the correct answer for the purpose of your exam.Now what if you multiply by a complex number? Youve got a good idea but its worth thinking it through carefully. Yes when you multiply a vector by i you preserve the length of the original vector. However you arent rotating the vector the same way that multiplying a complex number by i rotates it  counterclockwise.For an example where are your vectors? In the plane? It sounds like you want to do something like take the vector  multiply it by i assume thats a rotation then conclude that multiplying by i produces a vector perpendicular to the original vector. However thats not what happens multiplying  by i produces inot which no longer lives in your original plane. Youre now exploring the notion of orthogonality in C rather than the usual plane R.With complex scalars theres a generalization of the dot product called an inner product. In this case for a vector v youd want the set of all x in C such that ltcvvgt  . The righthand side becomes |c| ||v|| which for nonzero v is zero if and only if c.So the short answer is that expanding your set of scalars from R to C does indeed give you useful generalizations the vectors with which youre currently familiar. Multiplying a vector by i however no longer means rotation so multiplying by i does not produce a vector orthogonal to the original vector except when the original vector is  the zero vector.Hope this helps!,math,clj8ghs,3,t5_2qh0n

So for example pick some origin square on your board to be labeled . Then call the square  to the right and  down . If f that means the number  is in that square.Say your function is fxyx. That means if you square is directly above below or on the origin square you write  in the square. If your square is some number say x to the right of the origin square and some number up or down write x in the square. If your square is some number say x to the left of the origin square and some number up or down write x in the square. That way every square in the same column has the same value written in it moving right one column will increase the number written in the squares by  and moving left will decrease it by .

He said that since primes are numbers there must be some number of them. Thats actually a very sophisticated philosophical point. Im sure Colbert was actually doing his best in his way to teach his audience something about prime numbers.So Tao said there are infinitely many prime numbers to which Colbert said So its limited by infinite then.

2534341,0,t1_cmpdbo7,Okay so basically the way drag works is that its a bunch of parematers all multiplied then thats applied to the square of your velocity. Velocity determines drag. So lets think about this. Lets imagine your rocket is firing exactly the right amount of fuel to just hover in place. Youre spewing out fuel and getting nothing out of it because all your efforts are going into fighting gravity. Rising  meter per second is nearly as wasteful. So you need to avoid going slow. But at the same time going too fast will make you have increased drag remember velocity squared. So you need the happy medium. Basically with velocity as x axis and efficiency as y axis it forms an downwardopening parabola. I calculated that the velocity at the top of that parabola is at terminal velocity.,math,cmpdi3f,2,t5_2qh0n

2756267,0,t3_2rn4mp,The prime numbers I think need very little explanation.  Typically the prime numbers are introduced in the following way  A positive integer p is prime iff its only positive divisors are  and itself. We do not consider  to be a prime. However an equivalent definition is that a positive integer p is prime if whenever p divides the product ab then p divides a or p divides b.  Again we do not consider  to be a prime. Interestingly enough it is the latter definition that we generalize to define a prime element in a commutative ring.  The former property can also be generalized to a commutative ring and is known as irreducibility.  It happens that in the integers and any other Unique Factorization Domain the definitions are equivalent.Here are some of the more wellknown results and conjectures about the primes There are an infinite number of primes.  Euclids proof was one of the first proofs that I have seen from The Book. There are several ways to test whether a number is prime ranging from trial division to the AKS and MillerRabin primality tests. There are several ways to find prime numbers ranging from sieves to testing candidates such as Fermat numbers and Mersenne numbers  I have written a bit about Mersenne primes here The famous Prime Number Theorem describes the asymptotic distribution of the prime numbers.  Conceptually if an arbitrary integer is selected from a range of zero to a large integer N the probability that it is prime is about  fraclnN . Goldbachs Conjecture Every even integer greater than  can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Conjecture  There are infinitely many Mersenne primes but only finitely many Fermat primes. Twin Prime Conjecture There are infinitely many twin primes which are pairs of primes that have a difference of .  Much progress has been made in the past year regarding this conjecture as Yitang Zhang stunned the world with a proof that for some integer N that is less than  million there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by N.

2838094,0,t3_2slt1n,Perhaps you should take a completely different route and write about Grothendieck. He was also an extremely dedicated and prolific mathematician who distinguished himself at a young age and pursued math obsessively. He became wellknown as an expert at abstraction even compared to other mathematicians. He revolutionized and abstracted algebraic geometry to make it a vastly more unifying work.Interestingly Grothendieck grew disillusioned with math and mathematicians. Around  he largely withdrew from the public mathematics community. He formally retired and left in  whereupon he moved and lived a cloisterous and minimalistic life in the mountains. Some say he went crazy. Perhaps after looking deeper and higher than anyone before he did not like what he saw.Grothendieck died late last year very recently. There are some beautiful pieces written about Grothendieck. He was a marvelous and enigmatic man. Id like to bring your attention to an obituary written by famed mathematicians John Tate and David Mumford. They were asked by leading biology magazine Nature to write an obituary.

2852350,0,t1_cnsafp1,I think youre the one who understood my question the most as your answer gave me huge insights!Now heres the next step. The way I understood your question is this oneGiven a certain sudoku puzzle you can expand it by applying several rules in such a way as to create a game tree. The amount of branches that go down for a given number of times can be used as a probability. However if you use all of the possible rules and the puzzle only has a single solution all of those branches will eventually merge into the single solution.This is true as long as there is always a single step that brings you to a situation X to another situation Y and that step consists in inserting a certain number inside an empty cell in such a way that you know for sure that that number is correct.In the sudoku game this rule means that the puzzle is Playable you will always be able to make a move as opposed to be forced to guess at some point ending up in either a dead branch or the solution.Now in a situation where the game is NOT playable but has still a single solution if the number of moves is very large does it make sense to talk about probability?,math,cnsb9i1,1,t5_2qh0n

2872380,0,t1_cnukh9w,Conceptually the two column approach allows you to visualize all functions. If its the same c it might be easier to analyze another way. Think about partitioning the nodes based on their distance from c. This suggests that this has a component of a stars and bars problem. Suppose n and after  iterations things have converged. So you can group the nodes like W|XY|Z which would correspond to a single node W being already converged f WWc. There are two nodes that are  hop away fXfYc. And one node which is two hops away ffZ  c.Hm this isnt capturing everything because there can be many functions that achieve the same partition. Also you might have to account for the number of permutations of the elements I believe the stars and bars formula is unlabeled so maybe multiply by n! or something. Also I think you might want to make sure there are no empty bins so a configuration like ||| is disallowed because of the empty bin ||. An empty bin at an intermediate level would correspond to breaking the chain of fk x  for certain values of k the function would be undefined but would be defined for the next greater k or something like that.,math,cnul9n4,1,t5_2qh0n

Certainly mathematical arguments are governed by the rules of logic but then again so are more general rational arguments that may involve logical deductions based on a collection of established empirical facts.The neologicist position is that all of the truths of mathematics can be expressed in terms of logical truths. On the one hand for the exact reason you have stated that mathematical arguments are governed by the rules of logic. This is to say that the intention of math is that it makes sense.  When a logician uses the term make sense he or she means that it is valid within some logical system. That means that one is able to derive it as a theorem within some formal logical system. On the other hand all of mathematics aims to be true otherwise it is of no use conceptually or practically. So there we have it! Math is always supposed to be logical and always supposed to be true.

3018435,0,t1_coaq7wg,gt In every course I had to teach this three criteria were only used as a tool to be able to verify the continuity of some particular realvalued functions that are not defined the same way on the left and on the rightI understand the definition used in my class falls short of being able to evaluate a functions continuity. Luckily it is used in conjunction with the endpoint condition which I think solves the issue. As you have noted given our definition of a limit we would find that no limit exists at the endpoint of any function with a restricted domain say at x   for y  x. But the  function y  x is still continuous. The reason is because of the endpoint condition which states that when evaluating the continuity of a function we are only interested in seeing if points wholly encompassed within that functions domain have a limit. It is true that y  x has no limit at  according to our definition but y  x is still considered continuous because the endpoint condition tells us that we dont have to worry about the lack of a limit at .gt You should actually say that there is no function on the lefthand. Hence it does not make any sense to even talk about lefthand limit.So we both agree there is no function on the lefthand side. The contention lies in whether this means the lefthand limit does not exist or whether this means it is nonsensical to talk about the lefthand limit. I dont know enough to comment on why my boards curriculum has decided to select the former but that is the choice it has made.gt What about limits when x goes to infinity ? Is there a righthand side here ?I hadnt thought of that. It seems as if there would be no righthand limit if that is the case I expect there will be something akin to the endpoint condition saying something along the lines of if it tends to infinity just evaluate the lefthand limit to see if the limit exists. Not sure though!As for the other two questions I do not know how the material learned in my class would extend to multivariable functions of more complicated topological does that mean nonCartesian? spaces. Finally this is a very interesting discussion but seems to leave the underlying issue slightly aside. Which is regardless of the definition I was given I should have known to stick stringently to that definition during that test. Yet for whatever reason I failed to see that according to my class no lefthand limit exists.

I learned them when I was in regular Algebra II and until recently they continued to be taught in Algebra II. Ive been teaching Precalculus for about  years and weve always taught vectors too primarily geometricpolar. I also learned them in my senioryear regular physics class and I understand that they continue to be taught at that level.  The Common Core curriculum moved matrices to th year so Ive started teaching matrices too. Its also added algebraic vectors magnitude and dot product as well as representing complex numbers as vectors in rectangular and polar form. These are things that I learned in my high school Precalculus class and was always disappointed that I never got to teach my students. So Ive generally found these to be positive changes.

3116831,0,t1_col1h8i,First addressing the circle thing. You can zoom far enough in on a circle that you dont see that its a circle you just see a couple arcs going off to the horizon. What you see in this case is topologically equivalent to the real line. The curviness doesnt affect the topology. This is where the zooming thing is important because yes a circle is not the same as the real line.Ill try to sketch the proof that the letter T is not a manifold more carefully.Two topological spaces X and Y are equivalent topologically if there is a map f from the points of X to the points of Y so that a every point of Y is mapped to by a unique point of X and b closeness is preserved. Formally the function and its inverse are both continuous. For instance we can twist bend crease stretch etc. a space all we want but we cant cut it up or glue things together. Cutting implies that points that were nearby before are now far apart while gluing refers to the opposite. The technical term is homeomorphism.With this notion in mind a manifold is a topological space X so that for every point p I can zoom in near that point to get a subspace Xp which is homeomorphic to the real line.A neat thing about homeomorphisms is that if X and Y are homeomorphic and if f  X gt Y is the homeomorphism then for every point x in X I can remove x from X to get X and remove fx from Y to get Y and X and Y will be homeomorphic. The homeomorphism is still f were just forgetting about x and fx.Another neat thing about homeomorphisms is that they preserve the number of connected components or separated sections in your terminology. Basically connectedness really only depends on how close things are and since homeomorphisms preserve the latter they have to preserve the former.Before we jump into the exact reasoning here note that no matter how far we zoom into the Tee part of the T henceforth t our picture still looks like a T. Its still homeomorphic to a T by just stretching the branches out. Thus if T is a manifold we know that T itself is homeomorphic to the real line.So now lets suppose T and the real line are homeomorphic. Let f be such a homeomorphism from T to the real line R. We know that we can remove t from T and ft from R to get homeomorphic spaces. But removing t from T leaves a space with  connected components while removing ft from R leaves a space with  connected components. This violates the earlier property of homeomorphic spaces in that they have the same number of connected components. Since we only assumed that T and R are homeomorphic and concluded something impossible it must be that T and R are not homeomorphic.Thus since every zoomingin within T around t is homeomorphic to T itself this proves that the letter T cannot possibly satisfy the conditions of being a manifold.If you want more formalism then I recommend you pay a visit to Wikipedia or to read Monkres topology book.,math,col24yn,2,t5_2qh0n

3175519,0,t1_coqxhf4,Topologists really really like these things called manifolds. But theyre really hard so to distinguish between them we attach numbers to them via machines called algebraic invariants. One such invariant is called the Kervaire invariant which is of importance in geometric topology. Its kinda difficult to define but lets keep in mind that its only defined for framed manifolds ie those with a coherent way of assigning a coordinate system for the entire thing these are not common for example you cant frame the sphere.The Kervaire invariant one problem is well what it sounds like what are the manifolds with invariant ? Okay thats hard heres a slightly easier problem which dimensions admit manifolds of Kervaire invariant one? How do we try to solve this? Geometric topology only goes so far in some dimensions but the techniques get far too complicated to organize the information given by the invariant.THE BIG IDEA HERE is that the Kervaire invariant is cobordism invariant! Okay digression a cobordism between manifolds is another type of equivalence relation of manifolds in which manifolds are equivalent if they are the boundaries of other manifolds. You can look this up there are some pretty pictures you can draw etc. Whats the big deal? A theorem of PontryaginThom tells you that the cobordism of framed manifolds forms a ring the stable homotopy groups of spheres have you crapped your pants again? I have.Not only that we can represent elements of Kervaire invariant one as certain elements of the stable homotopy groups of spheres we have just turned this geometric problem into one of stable homotopy theory! This is the framework that Hill Hopkins Ravenel work in there are so many tools here we can use!Unfortunately that wasnt enough. It turns out that we were missing something because this approach was known for a long time since the time of Browder. It took until the golden trio to realize that the underlying the obstructions to solving this problem was a forgotten group action. Half the paper was spent developing this necessary framework from equivariant stable homotopy theory to prove the theorem.To end heres an idea of the attack. We want to show that above a certain dimension the elements representing the Kervaire invariant one manifolds die off via differentials in the AdamsNovikov spectral sequence. To build these differentials we refer to equivariant techniques to geometrically develop them and then use clever algebraic tricks to show they repeat ad infinitum in the E page of the ANSS. Hence the conclusion is that above dimension  all such elements die concluding the Kervaire invariant one problem as a modern triumph of algebraic topology.Okay time to get off reddit and do my homework.,math,cor53td,19,t5_2qh0n

3196641,0,t3_2wqxwo,Im not sure your intuition is quite right. Ive never studied category theory but Ill try and give my impression of it. A functor is better viewed as a map of categories. Categories consist of objects and morphisms so a functor should be defined for both and should act in a compatible way on them. What I mean here is that if weve a functor from a category A to a category B and x y are objects in A and f a map between x and y in A then we should have that Fx and Fy are objects in B and that Ff is a map between Fx and Fy.But theres a bit more than that too. Part of the definition of a category is that we can compose suitable morphisms. A functor between categories should also respect this aspect of the category struture in that we should get the same result if we compose two morphisms and then apply the functor as if we apply the functor to each morphism and then compose in the target category. So to finally get around to your question I think the answer is In general theyre different concepts. An operator is typically understood as a map of vector spaces. So the differential operator is an example as its linear. While its true that it can be seen to act on functions the usual perspective is that we simply view functions as elements of a vector space and so that differential operator then acts on the elements of a vector space just like any other operator. ,math,cotby8h,3,t5_2qh0n

This is not about health wealth fame or sex. Im under no delusions that my need to do this represents healthy psychology or healthy human behavior instead it probably comes from deep underlying inadequacy.Ill probably be downvoted for this but I kind of take the same attitude towards the intense study of math at an advanced level Im including myself of course.

3315945,0,t1_cp68o8l,That is true.  but we are trying to show if P is really just NP and vise versa.  Thus we say P  NP?.  My point is forget the multiverse and just assume infinite number of tries.  If we have had those infinite number of tries prior to our asking is there an algorithm that can find hamiltonian path for G in polynomial time? we should necessarily arrive at the answer that yes we can because there will be some time in the past when Gs hamiltonian path was guessed correctly by a random sequence generator.  and if we consider what we really mean by random in the real world and not the imaginary math world where randomness is assumed we see that there must have been a sequence of steps however complex that led our random generator implementation to produce this particular combination of output for that particular input i.e. graph G.  and if there is a sequence of steps there is an algorithm.,math,cp68uhi,1,t5_2qh0n
3316834,0,t1_cp6cdca,gt So you cannot say that if the nondeterministic Turing machine solves a decision problem in polynomial time then there must be a particular guessing deterministic Turing machine that solves that same decision problem in polynomial time.True but again I draw attention to observations.  You are right that we cannot say that in principle but we know that outputs are guessable if its possible to guess them.  So our observations suggest that there is a set of deterministic steps that implement function getPasswordtoxa in polynomial time because sometimes we can actually see such function work in real world with probability gt .  So if thats the case why not conclude that such an algorithm is possible in theory if we observe it sometimes naturally occur in practice?,math,cp6ci41,1,t5_2qh0n

Keep in mind Euclid worked with the naturals that were at least .edit The above should read  gt Because the integers are closed under addition subtraction i.e. the sum difference of two integers is an integer then  gtgt nm  k  nk  mk   gtis an integer if both nk and mk are.,math,cpi2med,1,t5_2qh0n

3548246,0,t1_cpwkc9t,Actually if youd like to have a more rigorous explanation for this look up Analytic Continuation In fact most divergent sums that Ive heard of that end up having a workable value come from certain analytic functions which can be extended uniquely into meromorphic functionsFor example the analytic continuation of  displaystylesumninfty zn  is actually just the function  displaystylefracz  as this is the actual value of the sum for  |z| lt  .Another example is the Riemann  zeta  function  displaystylezetaleftsrightsumninftyns  which can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function with a single simple pole at  s . So really  cdots    isnt true but the fact that the analytic continuation of  zeta  yields  zetaleftright    makes it a somewhat nice lie for remembering the values.In a similar sense going back to the geometric series although the series diverges for  z    we can still say that  displaystylesumninftyleftrightn    because  displaystylefracleftright   .

3570143,0,t3_3182k3,Maybe you could look at EvolutionaryGenetic algorithms. These are algorithms which are employed to solve or at least find good enough solutions to optimisation problems. They do this by making a family of initial solutions to the problem giving them some sort of genetic encoding and then mimicking the process of evolution to breed better solutions. How cool is that!?I used these in my undergraduate group project which looked at finding an optimal playing strategy for a dice game called Pig. Although the players score is completely determined by a random event the player has only a choice to continue and gamble their score or keep it  thats all the control they have it doesnt mean there isnt an ideal strategy. I will detail how we used them so you have an idea of how these things workFirstly we wrote some code which played a game of Pig between two players. Then we modified it so that it would play two strategies against each other. How did we tell the program a strategy? It was encoded in a massive array of s and s where  meant roll and  meant hold this would make sense if you knew how to play Pig!. This representation of a strategy was precisely our genetic encoding of a possible solution. The s and s were the genes. The program then made a sample of  or so strategies. This was the population we would evolve better strategies from. Then the program pitted each strategy against a a series of random samples recording how well it performed. After each strategy had completed its trials they were put in order of how well they performed and a probability distribution based on this was formed without going into details it basically meant if you asked for a strategy the probability youd be given a strong strategy was greater than being given a weak strategy. From this distribution parents are chosen and bred a new strategy was formed by random mixing of the genes of the parent strategy and then a mutation function was applied might switch a  to a  or vice versa with a very low probability just to mimic evolution that little bit more accurately. Then a weak strategy was chosen to die and was replaced by the child strategy  and then we have generation . This is repeated.. a lot.. and we hoped for it to give generations of higher average fitness a measure of how well the solution works.It worked and surprisingly well given the length of time we could run the algorithm a few days tops. By worked I mean it did generate a strategy which beat our standard strategy  a strategy we got from expectation value calculations. Back to your thesis We applied this to understand the playing strategies of a simple game. There was SO MUCH we could have done with this method we also used dynamic programming.. which required us to try and solve the most horrific system of equations ever. What I described above is a steadystate algorithm. We couldve tried generational. The difference is steady state replaces one strategy at a time whereas generational wouldve produced an entirely new generation each time. We didnt mess with the mutation functions too much just the probabilities we didnt look at using more sophisticated breeding procedures etc. Theres a lot of scope for tweaking these algorithms. Analysing the performance of these algorithms and comparisons with other types of optimisation algorithms I think could make a very interesting thesis. ,math,cpz82jt,3,t5_2qh0n

Im at university now and immensely enjoying my coursework. Im guessing you want to follow a similar route in which case Id recommend dipping in your toe in Olympiad maths by all means but remember theres a whole world of maths beyond that. Maybe ask yourself today do I want to solve a hard problem or do I want to learn some new theory? In the former case maybe just look for a hard Olympiad problem in the latter why not search google for some university lecture notes? Doing this also widens the scope of hard problems that you can tackle.Just to reiterate dont want to discourage you in the slightest from Olympiad maths. I absolutely loved it still do occasionally there are some beautiful problems there. But its a bit of a closed environment.

3711163,0,t1_cqfakze,A lot of proofs of reachability and controllability depend on standard hard analysis stuff and establishing rigorous inequalities. So you might have some system xFxu vector of system variables is x control vector is u and want to establish if a control function uxt within some class of functions can make this system produce a given endpoint x or rigorously show particular stability results in reponse to driving noise. Often you work with socalled hybrid systems which are continuous except for some collection of finite shocks which you cant handle by mechanically applying standard calculus stuff. You often want proofs of such results when you can get them and normally a proof of abstract reachability will be far more accessible than an explicit construction of the solution. I probably shouldnt restrict to real analysis I tend to mentally classify analysis over Rn and real manifolds under that name as well and Im not sure if thats standard usage.In graduate texts on control theory youll usually see rigorous developments of manifolds differential forms Lie algebras and similar stuff so at the very least real analysis is a prereq. for most of the theoretical side of the field.,math,cqfaqmr,3,t5_2qh0n

That is sufficient but not required to decide the primeness of   sumfrom  gtinf of n. Because if sumfrom  gtinf of n belongs to the rationals and is  then   sumfrom  gtinf of n is equal to  a prime. Or we can have the weaker there is some prime p which satisfies p  sumfrom  gtinf n. Etc.If you take the view of types then it is sufficient given that it is a valid expression that sumfrom  gtinf of n be of type natural.If you consider the procedure and a procedure is not the same thing as a mathematical function which returns a value of type natural number    function foo       declare natural result        declare natural index        loop forever          result  result  index         index  index                return result    then it is true it does not halt. What you refer to with the or disjunction operator is called shortcircuit evaluation and it helps because we neednt evaluate b and that can be the difference between halting or not if b does not halt. With something like shortcircuit evaluation like lazy evaluation we could conceivably make primeness  foo halt and return true without evaluating foo but its difficult to think what that would look like.Anyway this is supposed to be about algebra not programs.PS I know you are not being confrontational.

In your diagram one set is those vertices connected to the center by an edge. The other set is not. These two sets are composed of vertices which are equidistant from you. So the figure you would actually see could be drawn by taking two triangles of different sizes and overlaying them much like a Hebrew star. Then connect the vertices.

Of course that depends on the resolution go far enough from the start and no exponential function looks like a linear function.But lets say an exponential function should grow maybe one unit for a one unit increase from  in x.

How about . for every . increase in x?Of course Im describing a limit here one which can be rephrased as the familiar sequence nn which converges to e as n approaches infinity.So if we decided to describe interest rates on a much higher resolution like rate per second you could get away with using the equation Y  Y  exprt.,math,cr3lbkg,1,t5_2qh0n

After all youre asking these questions in order to determine the viability of such a trip right? Seems backwards for them to suggest theyll provide answers but only after youd already have committed.As for any concerns about traveling with a parent I expect that would be  unnecessary and  more difficult and expensive to coordinate. These programs are residential so youd be living in dorms under the supervision of their staff. I have no idea what sort of arrangements if any a parent or other family member would have to make to be nearby. Would Hampshire have room in their dorms for a family member? What if any visa arrangements would a parents need to make separate from your own arrangements? How much would any of that cost? Besides Amherst MA is relatively safe asis likely even safer when youd be oncampus during the summer and under the supervision of program staffso you shouldnt need a parent to accompany you. Separately your link to the Hampshire programs web page indicates their dates are July through August.

With a little courage and some good old fashion determination even you can master this highly effective mode of transport! First off your gonna need a plane to practice flying with. You can buy one rent one steal one or if your on a really low budget just build your own! A little enthusiasm some pvc pipes and few plastic tarps can go a long way! ProTip! Use a couple lawn mower engines to put the giddyup in your sky horse. Once you have your first plane you need to put it on a runway and go full throttle at the sky preferably at a sort of slopey angle. Try not to die as you ascend and make sure you dont go back down yet. Get some altitude and then maybe try out some flippy tricks. When youve had enough just point the thing at some ground and do the slopey angle thing again but in reverse this time. Congratulations! You are now a master of planes!,math,crgld95,4,t5_2qh0n

4050910,0,t1_crhrqed,Infinite sets are weird  in particular with size. When comparing infinite sets we need to use something called cardinality otherwise we wouldnt be able to compare say multiples of  vs multiples of i. Two sets have the same cardinality if you can match up every member of one set with every member of the other and each one will eventually have a match with no members of either set left out. This type of function is called a bijection. The way to map all the multiples of two to their own multiples of  is just mutliplying by .Interestingly this means that there are the same number of naturals ... and naturals without one of the members .... And the same number of naturals and integers ......  just alternate negative and positive. And the same number of rationals  the trick for that is to start at  in the xyplane and start going in a square spiral outwards taking xy every time you hit a point  but skipping repeats  it looks like thisSo every infinity is the same right? Everything can match up with the natural numbers  every infinite set is a countable form of infinity? Nope. There are more reals on any interval than there are natural numbers at all. We say the real numbers are uncountable. Georg Cantor proved this and heres how.Lets take our proposed list of reals. To make it simpler well just make it from  to . It doesnt matter what the list is so Im just going to pick some random numbers.....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ...  The list goes on forever obviously so Im just using a snippet to illustrate. Now were going to build a new number. First we look at the first digit of the first number the second digit of the second number et cetera.....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ....  ...And then we put make our new number by putting together some digits that are anything BUT the numbers we have listed. Im just gonna add  to keep it simple but you could do any offsets you want..... becomes ....So where is this number in the list? Its not the first one because the first digits have to be different. Its not the second one because the second digits have to be different. Its not the third one... it cant be anywhere in the list! And we can change the offsets we used to make any amount of numbers that we want  we could add  to each instead to make .... or  ignoring carrying to make .... or we could alternate adding  and  again ignoring carrying or we could add the digits of pi skipping zeroes. In fact if we take the offsets and combine THEM into a number then subtract  from each we have all the real numbers in base . This means the reals minus our list are THE EXACT SAME SIZE as the reals normally. Our list wasnt just incomplete it didnt do anything! So the real numbers are uncountable.,math,cri19wa,2,t5_2qh0n

4064919,0,t1_crjckka,gt Also just a glimpse of the world of damage that movie did to the sufferers of that disease that were fooled into thinking they could conquer their disease with willpower.Source? It seems to be the exact opposite of what youre saying. The movie actually lied and had film Nash taking meds in a period of his life when the real Nash was not wikipediagt After  he was never committed to a hospital again and he refused any further medication. According to Nash the film A Beautiful Mind inaccurately implied that he was taking the new atypical antipsychotics during this period. He attributed the depiction to the screenwriter whose mother he notes was a psychiatrist who was worried about the film encouraging people with the disorder to stop taking their medication.In fact heres what the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill had to saygt Amador believes the movies telling of the story of John Nashs recovery dispels many myths about schizophrenia and communicates important truths such asgt The vital role of medication in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia and the risks of discontinuing medication. In the movie Nashs delusions and hallucinations return with a vengeance when he stops taking medication. Later he takes newer medications even though he continues to seebut ignorehallucinations.Also I dont know a single person who went off their meds because of this movie. Maybe it was something that happened when the movie first came out but I assure you its a nonissue today. If thats what you mean source?gt Seriously just as fucking stupid as thinking you can outwit diabetes.No actually its not. An experienced schizophrenic can develop the insight to distinguish hallucination and delusion from reality to a large extent and can exercise will power to resist giving in to eg paranoia. This is part of what CBT a form of psychotherapy seeks to accomplish. Good luck doing that with diabetes. Now this is much much harder than most nonpsychotic people could imagine and many patients would rather just stay on the meds but it can be done. Not everyone can come off their meds some can discontinue one of multiple meds others can lower the dose of their single med etc.Second schizophrenia does not have a constant or continually worsening disease course. The untreated disease course should not be visualized as ex  it can be like sinxx. So its entirely possible Nash went off his meds and slowly recovered to some extent.And finally its questionable to what extent Nash would have been able to continue doing mathematics if he remained on antipsychotics. These are not easy meds to take and the doses required to quell psychosis can often leave the patient with a chronic feeling of sedation. Good luck doing math like that. gt Also just a glimpse of the abuse he put his family through.Please explain? Living with a schizophrenic can be very hard I dont know if thats what you mean. If so you can hardly blame the individual.,math,crjmo55,26,t5_2qh0n

4072296,0,t3_377j6r,indeed the abstract stuff is nice butits very important to work with matrices and be able to go from concrete to abstract and abstract to concrete rather than getting hung up at one level or the other.personal anecdote my path went applied linear algebra which was half matricesRn and half abstract linear mapsfin.dim vectorspacesthen abstact linear algebra which followed axler then module theorylinear algebra from dummit and foote and finally linear and multilinear algebra in grad school. The middle two involved almost no computations and were by far my favorite math courses while the other two were based on actually using matrices and doing things such as row reduction and computing bases for the column and null space the image and kernel of the matrix respectively or in the case of the graduate course doing things like working with tensors and quadratic forms and other computationalbased things such as that. Lots of matrices all over the place because theyre not as artificial as they are made to seem in grade school theyre just linear maps after picking a basis coordinates. Abstract linear algebra ala Axler is an important preintroduction to the functorial approach. After all No one gets excited about vector spaces. The interesting part of linear algebra is the subject to which we now turnlinear maps. Ultimately just try reading it and it you feel yourself unhappy with the lack of solid ground pick up any sort of applied linear algebra and get your hands dirty on the exercises and then see if you can reconcile the two approaches.,math,crkgvs3,2,t5_2qh0n

4100084,0,t1_crnk77v,Im not sure that  of your IQ comes from genetics has a precise meaning except as occurs to me now the very naive one but I think it imparts the right idea.Thinking about your vocabulary size example I agree that it is obviously a learned ability and yet it has a high heritability.  How is this paradox resolved?  It must be that most people included in the study have sufficient opportunity that their vocabulary size is governed much more by their inbuilt inclination and talent than by their environment.As an analogy long distance runners times would obviously be severely affected if they hadnt eaten for a day before a race but you probably wouldnt find that a large proportion of the variance of times from an Olympic race were explained by the runners diet of the previous  hours.The study of children of low socioeconomic status is consistent with this because of the possibility that such children have not yet had the opportunity.  It is relevant also that heritability for children is much lower than for adults which is suggestive that people tend to find a way to change their environment sufficiently to reach their natural abilities.It might help with understanding the notion of heritability to bear in mind that the variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances.,math,crnmv12,2,t5_2qh0n

4146982,0,t1_crsycdd,Well your ODE models can be thought of as time averaged descriptions of a stochastic process. A typical criticism is that stochastic effects might cause extinction at low population levels which may not occur in say a predator prey limit cycle. Your work sounds cool. Other things people often ignore are memory spatial variability finite resources for prey the fine details of the hunting patterns of predators and temporal fluctuations in the environment due to say seasonality. Most of these effects have been studied in their own but generally not together. Your modeling sounds like it will take place over large temporal scales where the mentioned effects might not matter. With that said another thing these models dont account for is the individuality in behavior which we see. Stochastic models could do a much better job with this. It could be cool to develop analogous agent based stochastic models and compare the outputs to ODE approaches. Good luck with your work! ,math,crsyzml,3,t5_2qh0n

Or translated to rudimentary mathematical notation    For two real numbers a and b which fulfill the condition that a lt b    there will always at least one real number c which fulfills the criterion    a lt c lt b.    Since this is also true for a and c you can say there must be infinitely many reals between a and b.In my post above I was using  as the a and . as b and tried to explain why there could be no c to fit between those two.PS If I treat . as a real number here I always come to the conclusion that .   because for the conclusion to be false either a|b has to be not real or a  b. ,math,crvrq7o,1,t5_2qh0n

In this way we will check  numbers or really  since we can ignore .Now lets do it with your method we first find the smallest prime factor  which requires checking  numbers.  Then we repeat this process on    and find the smallest prime factor  which requires checking  numbers.  Then we do this again and find  which requires checking  numbers.  So in this case the normal method would check  numbers whereas your method would check   .  Now your method will check on smaller numbers in general and if there are only a few prime factors will likely be faster but for a number with lots of prime factors of similar magnitude that probably performs worse.EDITactually Im dumb.  you know that on your second pass  you need to just start on five so you check  in that case so it may in general be more optimal.,math,csas46b,1,t5_2qh0n

4381297,0,t3_3b6hv5,Vector SpacesOn a map there is a compass which has the four cardinal directions and maybe four others i.e. NE NW SE SW. Really only special two are needed. Canonically we choose North and East. You can get anywhere on the map by moving some amount in each direction and combining them. Mathematically we would say that North and East are the smallest set of vectors that span the map via linear combination. That is for every point X on the map there are constants sometimes negative such that      X  c North  c South East.It is pretty straightforward to adapt these concepts to higher dimensions but we dont spend too much time visualizing. Now heres the fun part. While we tend to think about analyticcoordinate geometry in this way abstraction shows that a myriad of problems fit into this pattern of building new things for basicbasis things. For instance an nth order linear ODE defines an ndimensional phasesolution space and to specify elementspoints in this space you need a similar set of nmany basicbasis solutionsdirections and the notion of linear combination i.e. Eq. . Even more mesmerizing perhaps is that a linear PDE often defines a similar solution space whose dimension is infinite.

4406508,0,t1_csm8jz2,These are some great ideas in an idealistic environment. Where you have a LOT of time to spend with the students. However Im going to disagree with a lot of it or rather I suppose offer up an alternative viewpoint. I am a math teacher with over a decade of experience in high school for the record.I love the idea of visuals I think the more you can use them the better so I absolutely agree with that one.I am going under the assumption that these are students in NEED of tutoring. They may fail without it. In my experience those are the students who seek tutors hoping it will fix their problem for them.I would say your priorities should be. Make sure they are doing the assigned practice homework. If they arent you are likely not to be of much help. Encourage them to seek out their teacher at lunch or whenever is appropriate with questions in between tutoring sessions. Its their teacher who can really help them the most.. Try to do the methods the same way their teacher does them. You may have great methods that work for you but teaching them different ways often ends up being more confusing. Also there may be a reason in context of the course and upcoming lessons that the teacher is doing it a certain way. Good teachers probably have thought about all of this and not so good teachers might be more set in their ways. This isnt a hard rule just a strong suggestions for more cases. It will also ensure they are taking good notes so that you can see what they have learned and this will help keep them engaged in class.. As much as possible work on the assigned homework answering questions about what they dont understand from it and trying to improve their basic skills. In other words I would specifically disagree with  above. Dont over complicate it stick to the basics. It may not be the most fun but thats likely where they need the most help. If you are teaching them big ideas from scratch once a week it is likely not to work out very well. If you are supplementing the practice they are doing you could be a big help. As they practice and it becomes more natural to them the connections and understanding will come as well. Trying to explain anything complicated is likely not to help very much since there are so many holes in their knowledge.. Go over testsassessments with them. Review their mistakes with them. Look for any repeated mistakes.. In general you dont want to be assigning MORE work. Stick to the work they have already been assigned. It is incredibly rare that a student is present in class taking notes and legitimately doing all the work and not finding success in a class. That just really doesnt make sense. Be advised often students say they have done all the work but they really havent. They likely missed the harder questions near the end and didnt finish the rest of it. Even if it is done they havent checked their answers and corrected any mistakes. So they did it quickly just to get it done and not to learn the material.,math,csmcj5o,3,t5_2qh0n

4503994,0,t1_csycfni,The fact that the Busy Beaver dominates all computable functions means that there is in some sense a limit to how fast you can have a computable function grow. I suppose in some sense that the faster the computable function you define is the longer it might last before it eventually gets dominated by BB.I wonder if for any number N you could you define a computable function fx s.t. fx gt BBx for all x lt N .I suppose such a functions would have to exist but it would be hard to tell if a function met this criteria as the values of BBx may be uncomputable. Hence determining if such a program meets this criteria could also be uncomputable. Although Im not sure... are values of BBx uncomputable or is it only the function which is?This ties to something about the halting problem I dont get  its impossible to make a program that can determine if any arbitrary Turing program halts. Ok I get that.Given a Turing program is there an oracle program which can be used to determine if that program halts?I mean what happens if you switch the quantifiers    there does not exist an oracle which can assess all programsbut     for all programs does there exist an oracle which could assess it?,math,csydp0l,2,t5_2qh0n

You can prove that this is differentiable to all orders everywhere but at x its Taylor series is just . i.e. the zero function all derivatives at x are . The negative exponential decreases faster than any form of polynomial growth increases so all derivatives are forced to zero. Unfortunately the function itself is not zero anywhere else. The infinite Taylor series does not match the function in any region around zero. It changes from zero more slowly than any derivative can detect but it still does change.In other words there are infinitely differentiable functions smooth functions which have zero radius of convergence for their Taylor series are not analytic.

I get that they are meant to lighten things up but when key ideas  are shooting by in quick succession these divert the attention and can make you lose the flow. I think Vi Hart does a good job of speaking quickly through parts of the narrative that are less important sometimes it is so quick that you simply stop processing what she is saying and just watch the visuals and slowingpausing dramatically on the key insights.  The transition between fast and slow helps emphasize the main ideas.  So I would suggest trying something like that  slow down for the key points and let them hit home.I also think it could have used some more concrete examples to show the power of math notation.  What were the effects on our society as a result of particular inventions in notation?

However I know that Smolin is a critic of it and part of his criticism seems to be that string theory takes away from research into other models of quantum gravity which I think is valid.The argument that many physicists like to make for string theory is that the mathematics is so beautiful that it cant not be wrong at least this is what I understand them to be saying. I think that that is a fallacious argument. Just because the math is pretty doesnt mean its physically valid. It may be a valid mathematical framework but there are plenty of valid maths that are not physically allowed a simple example are certain solutions to something simple like the wave equation. String theory has been around for a while and not produced anything not a shred of a shred of anything that experiment has been able to confirm which is problematic. Also my own personal opinion is that a quantum theory of gravity maybe should be developed before trying to unify it with the other forces and string theory seems to be trying to do both at the same time.

As mentioned in another comment the log of the number you posted is rather large itself but still you can write it down in exponential notation. Lets now define a new function. Log was how many digits you need to write the number our new superlog is the amount of logs you need to get the result below . So superlog is  and so is superlog  and superlog  is . You can see that this function increases rather slowly and that absolutely unimaginable numbers are reduced to.. Well.. .

The most natural intuition for this IMO is that if your group acts on a set then conjugating the group elements by A gives the same action as preapplying A to the set in the sense that ABAAx  ABx.In particular the invertible matrices forms the general linear group which acts on the set of vectors. So conjugating matrices by A is the same as preapplying A to the vector space i.e. changing basis as uguyondrugs points out.On the other hand we can also think of matrices in an inner product space as encoding bilinear forms by BvwltvBwgtvTBw. Then BAvAwvTATBAw  ATBAvw. So ATBA encodes the linear form obtained by preapplying A to vectors which we could reasonably call the change of basis of the linear form B.If in some context youre seeing a lot of ATBA come up instead of ABA this probably means you should be thinking of your matrices as bilinear forms on V instead of as linear endomorphisms VgtV.,math,ctxbwfp,1,t5_2qh0n

Was it last semester that you failed or are you talking about back in high school? Also what did the remedial math class cover? How comfortable are you with manipulating and graphing linear functions polynomials and rational functions? Are you familiar with trigonometry e.g. the unit circle and trig functions? What about exponential and log functions? Ideally these would be the topics covered in a precalc class possibly along with some basic notions of limits and discussions of asymptotes.There is also the question of what your study habits are like. Its entirely possible that youre ready for calculus but you just dont do the homework or you do homework with friends and just copy their work. Both tactics will see you with a failed grade almost every time. If your study habits are really bad you can work on those and youll see an improvement in the quality of your work.If you think its unlikely that you will pass calculus based on past experience then I dont think that taking some extra classes to get into shape before you try and tackle calc is a waste of time.

They are undoubtedly great mathematicians but neither are my choice even if I do particularly like Euler. Erdos is another popular choice by virtue of being a prolific mathematician but Im not sure he has had much seminal work. To me Von Neumann is number . While he was not as prolific as Gauss and Euler and he might not have as many things named after him he also lived more than a hundred years later than them. Regardless he has not only shown focused interest in many fields but has had significant influence in some. To me he is great because not because he solved problems that he could do but problems that he should do. He is perhaps best known for his contributions to Game Theory Nuclear Physics and Computation but he was at his heart a mathematician.

The length of the diameter portion is r and the length of the circular portion is r.If we create two new semicircles of radius r along the original diameter such that they are tangental with each other at point A and tangental with the original semicircle.  The total length of the two new semicircles is r which is equal to r the length of the original semicircle.If we continue to perform split these smaller semicircles into smaller semicircles the length will remain r while all the points will approach the line.  With an infinite number of iterations we find that the diameter line and the semicircles share all of their points thus are the same.  Since they are the same r the length of the semicircles and r the length of the diameter line are equal.  r  r thus  .This can be further modified to allow any two numbers to be set equal to each other.sorry if my writing is confusing.

5103378,0,t3_3kw4av,Since I dont know what you know Ill start from the beginning. We have something called a vector space which is a collection of vectors. These vectors are anything that can be added together and multiplied by real numbers polynomials are one example. Points in euclidean space are another. This space has a number called its dimension an Ndimensional space is one where if you select N vectors from it such that theres no way to represent any of those N vectors as a sum of multiples of the other N vectors every vector in the vector space is the sum of multiples of those N vectors. An N x Mthat is M wide and N tall matrix is a linear transformation that takes elements of an M dimensional vector space and outputs elements of an N dimensional vector space. For a transformation T to be linear means that for a scalar k and vectors v and w kTvw  kTvkTw. In other words it is commutative with multiplication and distributes over addition. In euclidean space this means rotations about the origin reflections about lines passing through the origin and scaling one or more coordinates. Many phenomena can be modeled as approximately linear and so can be represented using matrices. For example lets say we have two species of bacteria and we want to model their growth rate. We might say that . At   At   .  Bt     Btwhere A and B are the populations of the two species of bacteria. The natural question to ask here is what if any is the natural equilibrium of this system? So what were looking for is a vector that when put into the matrix returns itself or a scaled version of itself. Those vectors are called the eigenvectors of the matrix and the amount by which theyre scaled are its eigenvalues. In this case the eigenvectors are sqrtsqrt and sqrtsqrt with eigenvalues of . and . which should tell you that Im bad at choosing examples since negative populations are completely nonsensical. It also tells you that once you account for the weaknesses in the model either both species will approach the same population or one will completely wipe the other out. I dont have any particular experience in finance but presumably there are linearish systems for which youre interested in finding an equilibrium state.,math,cv15b28,1,t5_2qh0n

5124881,0,t3_3l6fkm,I actually have an interesting piece of information Id like to add that no one here has really touched upon.... And thats where the hell did e and the natural log actually COME from? I wrote a paper on this at one point.Edit  Here is the paper that I wrote  Please understand that this was always meant to be a private paper for myself.  I have never written a mathematical paper before and this wasnt for a class or assignment.  I literally only wrote it for my own personal understanding of the topic.  So please dont be super critical of it! There was also some funky stuff that happened when I uploaded it to google docs to share it...  hopefully the formatting is all still readable...Im going to go back in time to the development of the logarithm.  The log was a way of performing multiplication in some base by simply using addition.  Meaning every time you add one number your output is proportional to the last output.At some point in time shortly afterwards mathematicians were working on integration techniques.  They noticed that the basic methods of finding anti derivatives worked for everything except for x.  However it was realized that if you break down the graph of x into increasingly large segments    ... That the area under the curve stayed the same.  this is actually very easily provable!  But now look what they found.....  They found that the area under the curve increases by simple addition as you double the interval.  Meaning adding the area interval      is simply the same area added together  times.  This should stick out to you because this is exactly how we defined a logarithm to work.  Addition carrying out multiplication with some base number.  Because this logarithm seemed to be so natural it just came about all by itself it was called the natural logarithm.  So the relation was known that lnx  integral of x before it was known what that base number was.  Euler was actually able to calculate the number and the proof for that is very interesting as well!  See my paper for the proof.  Most of the other comments here have been talking about why functions containing e are interesting but from what Ive read no one has answered your question of what is e and where did it come from.  Hopefully my answer helped a bit!,math,cv3qo0n,111,t5_2qh0n

5362268,0,t1_cvx26a5,If you read the geometric description below youll notice something cool the determinant of a x matrix gives the volume of the parallelogram which had the columns of that matrix for its sides. If you find  volume it corresponds to a degenerate parallelogram that is two of its sides lie in the same D subspace possibly after a translation.Similarly in d the determinant will be related to the area of the four sided object whose sides are the columns of the related x matrix. In this case zero area or  det means the column vectors lie in the same subspace indeed at least after a translation. Coincidently a matrix is invertible iff is columns are linearly independent which is also the basis for using the Wronskian to establish you have fundamental solutions in d odes.Edit Check out tactics description of alternating tensors below.

5466229,0,t3_3pwqj7,Something to be aware of if youre thinking of going to grad school in the US.  The number of foreign applicants to US schools is enormous youre basically competing against the whole world and the number spots is limited it is very difficult politically for instance to admit only foreign students.  As a result the grad schools can afford to be very picky about who they admit.  A foreign student with a B average probably isnt going to be admitted to a US grad school.

5542044,0,t3_3r0axy,I dont think the problem is well defined  it doesnt say what the objective is. It seems to be phrased as a game taking credence to mean a recommendation  i.e. Sleeping Beauty has to say heads or tails. But the game doesnt define what the consequences are of getting it wrong.If we specify the game slightly better by adding some details it becomes possible to decide on an optimal strategy. If the problem is to find a stateless contextless strategy that minimises losses where each time Sleeping Beauty is woken up she loses r if she says heads when it was tails or tails when it was heads and loses  i.e. profits  if she is correct. Since she is asked twice and hence stands to lose or profit twice if it is heads this weights the game.Since sleeping beauty has no state or contextual information she can only decide on one strategy and since there are only two outcomes we can model that strategy as a real number variable p  lt p lt . Suppose that the probability of a head is q known in advance. Let Lp q r be the expected loss given strategy p in the game defined by parameters q and r.From the formulation of the problem Lp q r  p  prq  pr  prq  prq  pr  pq  rq r  prq  r  q  rq  rIf rq  r  q lt  for example at q   r   i.e. no penalty for getting it wrong fair coin then the optimal solution is p   i.e. always saying heads. If rq  r  q gt  the optimal solution is p   i.e. always saying tails. For q   this does not occur for any r while for a coin that always comes up tails for any positive r it is better to say tails.

5637945,0,t1_cwvj3vu,gt has anyone successfully be able to make themselves work hard who hasnt done so in the past? Yup.  Ive been a lazy piece of shit my whole life and one day I decided to change.  It took  years of college to learn what hard work actually feels like but if you work hard enough for long enough you get the hang of it.  I went from being a lazy mathphobic and mathilliterate lump to majoring in pure math at a great university and doing awesome.  Hard work is hard and people who havent learned how to work hard give up because... well because its hard.  They dont even know what hard work looks like.  I saw this sort of thing all of the time when I was a math tutor and mr. poopy underwear guy up there said the same thing.  People think that its hard work to stare at a problem for two hours waiting for a solution to magically appear in their brains.  They see the smart kid staring at her paper for a while and then finishing the problem and they assume that theyre stupid because they cant do the same thing.  Except the smart kid is thinking her way through the problem not sitting around waiting for the problem to solve itself.Quality practice is not as unattainable as innate genius.  It takes work.  You have to practice practicing.  You need to set a short term goal and give yourself enough time to figure it out.  Not just enough time to reach that goal but enough time to figure out how to reach it.  At first its going to take forever but eventually you get the hang of it and then learning anything becomes significantly easier.Last week I had a gigantic problem set to do and while I knew how to do one of the problems the long and tedious way I also knew that there was an easier way and that I just didnt understand the material normal subgroups and conjugation well enough to figure it out.  So I made up my own easier problem to learn from.  I spent  hours writing out this group and its subgroups making colored drawings showing patterns between subgroups that were normal and subgroups that werent doing test cases with conjugation googling anything that was unclear and rereading my notes and my textbook.  I had it figured out after an hour or two but it still wasnt intuitive to me so I kept going until it was.  By the end of it I actually legitimately understood that topic and was able to do that one problem the smart way and visualize similar problems through my own work rather than a two sentence definition.  That was hard work.  And that sort of thing always pays me back come exam time when I dont have to spend all night learning material because I learned it right the first time.First you have to want something though.  Its hard not to be lazy if you dont care about what youre working on.  I always tell myself that if someone else finds a particular topic interesting there must be something interesting about it and between actively studying and talking to those people I can figure out how to enjoy it.  I might not end up interested in that subject but it keeps me engaged enough to make it through a GE class or to learn that basics of something that I just want to know.edit The article you linked about deliberate practice gives you some good ideas about how to start doing this.  For example practicing something that youre already good at isnt practice.  You should be spending your time doing things that you arent good at screwing up and then trying again now that you know one more thing that you shouldnt do.  Eliminating weaknesses is just as important as developing new skills.,math,cwvxvu0,3,t5_2qh0n

The problem is that the intermediate value theorem solution on a circle can stretch across the two ends of the interval.More precisely if C is a circle of circumference at least  and f is an integrable realvalued function on C then there exists an arc A of C of length  such that the integral of f on A is equal to the average value of f on C.  The reason is that the average value of f on C is equal to the average value of all such integrals over arcs A of length  so it follows from the intermediate value theorem that at least one such arc gives the desired value.,math,cxckdnx,12,t5_2qh0n

Rewriting An in rcis format we get     ixn  xncisan    Raise both sides by n and applying De Moivres law which can easily be proved by induction we get    ixnn  xnncisnan     Taking the limit the LHS is the definition of eix and on the RHS the radius term goes to  while from above we know nan goes to x leaving us with  eix  cisx  ,math,cxk5t7k,1,t5_2qh0n

Im guessing this is what youre picturing in your head when you say polygon.Anyhow youre an ant on a toothpick and youre facing some direction.  Call that direction north just to give it a label.Now imagine you as an ant start walking off in that direction turning a little clockwise each time you encounter a new edge so as to continue walking along the toothpicks.  Eventually youll wind up back where you started but more importantly youll also be facing the same direction as when you started.Can you convince yourself that once you return to your original position your antbody has made a single clockwise  rotation i.e. a full circle?  If youre having trouble imagine you have a compass and thats all youre looking at.  The compass needle would start off pointing N and rotate a little each time you turned clockwise.So however much turning you did it all has to add up to .  Each turn covers the same angle since thats the regular in regular ngon and you make n such turns thats the n in regular ngon.The angle by which we turn is the exterior angle so the exterior angles must add up to .  Since there are n of them each external angle cuts out n degrees.Every exterior angle has a corresponding interior angle and the two angles must add up to .

What we dont necessarily have is a set containing all those xSs all at once.In ZFC the axioms are precisely the things that tell us which kinds of sets we have. If we say that a particular set exists then we need to be using an axiom or an argument that uses the axioms to prove that. gt What is meant by an explicit choice function? A choice function is a function that takes an element of S as input and produces an element xS such that xS in S. Note that as a function in set theory it is a set indeed a set of ordered pairs and as a set its existence must be justified by axioms.gt Why do I have to give a rule or procedure to describe the function? You do not necessarily have to give a procedure in the sense of a list of steps to actually compute the function you just need to demonstrate that the function exists using an argument starting from the axioms of set theory.gt Stick your hand in the drawer. Move hand around. If you touch something soft you will eventually touch something soft take it outIn the analogy this is precisely what the axiom of choice is saying. Its saying that this method is a valid method of creating sets. Also keep in mind that the axiom of choice only matters for infinitely many choices. If you have one pair of socks you do not need the axiom of choice to find a choice function.,math,cxnqr63,11,t5_2qh0n

But this framework is not needed for ABC and will be needed when we want to develop IUT further  which is what Mochizuki is actually interested in. Brian Conrad said it was a bit like what Grothedieck did when developing Topi. He introduced and used thsee highly abstract concepts of topi to establish Etale Cohomology which was conjectured and needed for the Weil Conjectures. But you dont need topi to use Etale Cohomology and people distilled it down to be usable and practical without topi. But the whole point of trying to prove difficult conjectures is not to have a proof  but to hope for new ideas in math.

5978846,0,t3_3xb9d4,Its pretty easy if you know the function that describes the shape of your axes. Say you want to plot a graph of z  x  y  and the axes you want to describe it over is xsinz in the D plane. I.e. a D vertical sin wave that only affects the x axis.z  xsinz  y  plotted on a normal set of axes gives you the same plot as the original equation over the deformed axes. Which in this case is an upside down cylindrical cone distorted by a linear sin wave.Heres the rule of thumbEquation you want to deform zgxyDescription of axes you want to use zfxyReduce axes equation f to seperate out the variableszhxyxiyzyjxzThen take the equation zgxy that you want to deform and susbtitutez gt zhxyx gt xiyzy gt yjxzThen you simply plot this equation on a standard set of axes zhxy  gxiyz  yjxzWhich gives you the plot of function g as deformed by the set of axes described by the function fThis also works in higher and lower dimensions but can get inhumanly complicated if the deformed axes have complicated descriptions.If you were attempting to integrate around a set of nonlinear axes then you would have to use the reverse of this approach in order to use standard methods of integration.,math,cy3cvtv,1,t5_2qh0n

6113593,0,t3_3z9vvt,It does not seem like a social network problem. It is a random sampling problem. You are asking what proportion of total attendance records you need and the answer is prefferably you should at least have n in your sample whatever proportion it is of the total. If the sample is truly randomly comprised then the proportion of the total population will be reflected. The bigger the n in your sample the better the precision of proportions of the total population in your sample.Also if you randomly sample from population several times then you can use the Central Limit Theorem. Namely say you sample from the population  times and record the proportions each time like this attended not........ Then you just use the mean of attended not of those ten sample trials which  will be close to the real population means.Finally we can calculate the confidence intervals for proportions.

Each check was straightforward but the whole exercise was so boring and stupid that IIRC I never actually finished it and let the professors incredible lack of organization take the blame for the missing homework.That was an incredibly disappointing class because the subject matter is fascinating but the professor was an appallingly bad instructor.

While pirate just refers to the illegal nature of the broadcasts there have also been notable pirate offshore radio transmissions.gt Pirate radio generally describes the unlicensed broadcast of FM radio AM radio or short wave signals over a wide range. In some cases radio stations are deemed legal where the signal is transmitted but illegal where the signals are receivedespecially when the signals cross a national boundary. In other cases a broadcast may be considered pirate due to the nature of its content its transmission format especially a failure to transmit a station identification according to regulations or the transmit power wattage of the station even if the transmission is not technically illegal such as a web cast or an amateur radio transmission. Pirate radio stations are sometimes called bootleg stations a term especially associated with twoway radio clandestine stations associated with heavily politically motivated operations or free radio stations.,math,cyryq4c,1,t5_2qh0n

If someone doesnt understand that precalculus is not really a field of mathematics but rather a collection of different and useful ideas then having the class called Trigonometry would be perplexing.

6387060,0,t3_435hhi,You could look for places to ask students what happens if we relax certain conditions. For example students always take for granted commutative operations like multiplication. So maybe talk about what might happen if you dont have it. Possibly glossing over some technicalities there are realworld scenarios where we can model something via noncommutative multiplication say D rotations which could lead to a brief discussion of quaternions.If you teach a unit on translations rotations and reflections of objects you could lead into a brief discussion of the dihedral groups which you could again tie back into noncommutative operations. If you teach combinations and permutations you could again discuss permutation groups and dihedral groups.These discussions dont have to be huge  the occasional  minutes toward the end of a math lesson is likely enough time to get the main point across. And if youre so inclined you could always put out the occasional bonus problem on homework that involves some of these discussions.

6401031,0,t3_439efx,Im currently reading A Brief History of Mathematical Thought by Luke Heaton and Ive come across a section I dont really understand. Its called Structures of Irrationality. Kind of deflating to read this as this is not a book for math students its meant to be a casual read. Not that I am a math student Ive been learning from the ground up over the last  or so years but still. I feel like I should grasp this more quickly. I just dont understand what the author is trying to describe. At any rate heres a picture of the section in question.  First of all I dont understand what those square looking brackets are. Ive seen them used to floor a number i.e. the next smallest integer but I dont see how that fits in to this context. E.g. if the remainder Deltax is small our initial approximation x must have been close to x. Why is this? Im having a hard time grasping why this must be true and why the flooring function is used.  Because of my lack of knowledge with regards to the first point I dont really follow whats happening on the next page. Maybe it will be clear if I understand whats going on with this best rational approximation business. ,math,czh8dcx,1,t5_2qh0n

Ill draw an arrow from each box to the box which contains its number. Naturally each box has one number in it and has its number contained in exactly one other box so it has  arrow going out and  arrow going in.Now suppose I were to follow these arrows. I might immediately go back to the box I started with if its arrow pointed to itself. Alternatively I could go to another box. If I were to keep following the arrows I would eventually wind up back where I started. The set of boxes and arrows that I went along is called a cycle. Note that each box is part of exactly one cycle to see this try imagining putting the boxes in a cycle along a circle. Clearly each box must be part of one of these circles. To see that each box can be in at most one cycle consider this if a box were a part of two cycles it would have to have either two in arrows or two out arrows which would imply either two number contained in the box or two numbers assigned to the box respectively. This is impossible. We can therefore know that each box is a part of exactly one cycle.,math,czqeydt,1,t5_2qh0n

In reality of course there is no  such finite set and there is no guarantee that multiplying a given set of primes and adding  will NOT be divisible by some much larger prime that was not considered in the starting set.The earliest counter example is given by Schrodingers Uterus above  Of course a corollary is that the multiplication p  p... pN  will not have any of the original primes ppN as prime factors as you can see in his example. ,math,d0avhtu,19,t5_2qh0n

For example Id be seriously surprised if there is a theorem in logic that is proved by using the power series method for finding solutions to differential equations.They said nothing about a theorem that is not provable and in fact no such thing exists since I can just add whatever theorem as an axiom and create a new system yes even if it is false it just wont be a very useful system.

As a theoretical computer scientist I rarely have to go beyond  though I have worked in logic with order types up to  and even  so nominally there shouldnt be much distinction for me between ordinals and cardinals.  However as a computer scientist I am also very conscious about structure and I will make a distinction between  and   using the latter when ordering is important e.g. sequences are functions from  rather than from  or when talking about the infinte limit of a sequence of finite structures e.g. infinitiary logics.

6834346,0,t1_d0qxot3,Could you clarify something for me about maths teaching in the US? Most of the schoolage maths that seems to be talked about is AP calculus. Is this the only advanced maths done in the final two years or are there other modules e.g. AP mechanics AP statistics AP geometry?I think there are quite a lot of problems shared between mathematics education in the UK and US. Although Lockharts Lament is written about the US system pretty much every system is spot on for the British system as well. Rather than properly developing the idea of rigour or giving the pupils a chance to explore any topic the focus is on the teaching and use of mathematical tools that are going to either be forgotten within five years or remembered with horror by the majority of GCSE students which as I understand it is the equivalent of leaving before taking AP maths classes.The problem is each student requires a different well defined path. Someone going into a physics degree wil require familiarity with the techniques of using calculus but may not care how they were created just what physical phenomena can be investigated using them. A budding philosopher would probably want to know about logic and set theory and the process of proving a mathematical statement but wont care to learn much about algebra trig or calculus.Either way I think that more knowledge of stats is a good thing for everyone even if they dont appreciate learning it at the time. Knowing the difference between absolute and relative risk knowing about mean median and variance understanding correlation can all help someone assess risk or understand when a politician or news source is misusingmisrepresenting figures.,math,d0qz3cd,2,t5_2qh0n

6849871,0,t1_d0sp1a2,OK from context I figured you were OP. Its still good to have confirmation though. And rmath can be impatient with what it sees as homeworklike questions so I cant say Im surprised that your post was directed to other subreddits instead.So my |adbc| condition above is sufficient but not necessary. For a more methodical approach to the problem think of n as being an indeterminate rather than a specific yettobeidentified positive integer. Then when considering the quotient anbcndyou might want to try something like polynomial longdivision. One catch however is that since you want integer coefficients everywhere rather than say rational ones youll need to be a bit more careful.Lets first take the case where a c   and WLOG |a|cgt. Then by the Euclidean algorithm you have a  cq  r   r lt c c  r q  r   r lt r ...Using the above youll be able to reduce anbcnd to the case of a simpler fraction. The main thing is that your constant terms will shift to account for the division algorithm steps.Its almost certainly easier to consider an example than have me try to describe a general algorithm. So lets consider whether nnis in lowest terms for all n in N.We have                  Using the first line we have n  n    n  n because       bwhence nn  n  nn    nn.In other words nn is always in lowest terms if and only if nn is always in lowest terms. Further nn is always in lowest terms if and only if its reciprocal nn is always in lowest terms.Now we repeat the process with  and but weve already got that in the continuation of the Euclidean algorithm for  and  above   . Thisll further reduce things to a case of whether something of the form nfn is in lowest terms.If you keep going in this direction in general youll end up with a case along the lines of anbdi.e. the coefficient on n in the denominator is . This separate case requires different techniques but it should be clear that you now have a much simpler question is anb always relatively prime to the constant d rather than the linear polynomial cnd where c in general. Ive made a little more progress here too but this is getting walloftexty already so Ill leave things there for now.I have no idea how much of this can be generalized to quotients of arbitrary nonzero polynomials in n though. Since you still want allinteger coefficients everywhere that would complicate any attempt to do polynomial long division. Still however incomplete this is I hope it has helped!,math,d0sqnqf,1,t5_2qh0n

7158903,0,t1_d1r9p40,Absolutely. First watch this video.The line patterns you get in resonant frequencies of vibration are called nodal lines. If youve heard of the term standing wave the nodal line is the standing part. Nodal lines are also called nodal components. This is because in higher dimensions standing waves can also occur but the standing part of the wave is not a line but some other abstract shape.Now suppose the square has opposite edges attached The top edge of the square is attached to the bottom and the left to the right. By attached I mean that the wave must be exactly the same on the opposite edges  the square is still flat. A vibration that satisfies this equality of opposite edges is called an arithmetic wave.In the paper I count nodal components of arithmetic waves. In general the nodal components can vary wildly and they are hard to count so I consider a probabilistic model The arithmetic wave is chosen at random thus called an arithmetic random wave and so the count becomes a random number which can be dealt with tools of probability expectation variance concentration etc. to tell what the typical behavior is.It turns out that asymptotically i.e. in high resonant frequencies there is some typical number which can be written in terms of the frequency. In the paper I investigate how typical that typical number is and I show that there is exponential concentration around it. That is the probability to deviate from this number decays exponentially. In that sense most but not almost all of the arithmetic waves will obey the law and have the typical number of nodal components.,math,d1rwbvu,11,t5_2qh0n

7257444,0,t3_4epoat,The answer is obviously yes but I think you have more requirements in mind.  The immediate way to do this is to expand one gamma as an integral and the other as a series.  The Fourier or Laguerre series give an immediate answer.Or you can expand one as a product if you dont like series.Others have pointed out ways to include gammas in the integral using known product formulae.  Similarly if you view that type of answer as unproductive to your ends you can simply build the double integral combine terms maybe do a substitution with the xy product or the xy in the exponential extract out one of the integrals over one of the variables and just define this new function for that integral.  Most ways of doing this actually give functions expressible in common terms though typically just hiding the gammas in various ways.The point though is that as given the question is an obvious yes.  You need criteria on what you consider acceptable to you for this representation.  That would need to be based on what you were actually doing.  When asked though you seemed reluctant to clarify which makes it extremely difficult for anyone to want to waste their time producing an answer that could be perfectly valid as stated but not what you want wasting everyones time.,math,d234bku,4,t5_2qh0n

This is definitely one of the best textbooks for learning Galois theory. I felt like a lot of other authors missed much of the required theory building.

I dont think anyone will ever come across a real problem that requires them to prove Fermats last theorem but whatever.gtthe next sentence which strikes me as alarmingly ignorant.Why? Im not claiming that there isnt useful math. Or even that there isnt a lot of useful math.What I am claiming is that many areas of math are useless. Concerned with entirely artificial and made up problems that arent likely to ever occur naturally.I was thinking specifically of number theory. Which I admit is not entirely useless. Everyone gives the example of cryptography using number theory to prove its not a useless field. But the number theory used in cryptography is really basic stuff and it only touches a tiny fraction of all the work that has ever been done in number theory.And its not even known if number theory is necessary for cryptography. If there hadnt been research on prime numbers and elliptic curves they might have chosen some other hard math problem to base it on. Maybe theres an alternate universe with cryptography based on some kind of constructed SAT problems.And number theory isnt even that far removed from reality. It emerges very naturally from basic math equations. Grade schoolers are taught about prime numbers. And yet it still seems to be mostly useless. But there are areas of math that are far more removed from reality and will never find any practical applications.And let me be clear Im not trying to attack you personally or even attack mathematics. Its still really fun and interesting which is why so many people do it. And other careers arent much better. Im slowly coming to the realization that most work that most people do is useless.

7539350,0,t1_d2xkfdu,gt No one would ever bother writing down a th order ode unless its trivial to solveIm really quite surprised that a response which makes such an elaborate generalization of mathematics is upvoted so strongly. Yes in theoretical mathematics one often changes nthorder problems to firstorder systems but to make the generalization that nobody does it unless its trivial to solve is a bit ridiculous.I find this idea quite common amongst pure mathematicians to be honest. Have a look at the classic book by Bender and Orszag discussing mathematical methods for often physically motivated problems and note that almost never are the higherorder differential equations converted to systems. Outside of pure theoretical analysis such a conversion often yields very little simplification. Anyways as people have pointed out the fKdV fifthorder KdV is a prototypical example. It is nonintegrable in most forms. Methods of analysis include asymptotic analysis where it is typically treated in its full fifthorder form. The other example I have worked with includes as the OP notes formulations in solid mechanics and elasticity. While the beam equation is typically known it its fourth order form fourthderivative of deflection equated to load there may be extra boundary conditions or constraints that require you to work with a fifthorder variant. For example elastocapillary studies will often involve coupling of elastic effects to fluid mechanics. Because the fluid equations may involve the gradient of the pressure this means you need to include a differentiated beam equation in the fluid mechanics  hence leading to fifthorder PDEs or ODEs. The distinction can also be somewhat artificial. If you work with the angle of the deflection theta then the beam equation is only the third derivative of theta equated to pressure. So you see it depends on what quantity is desired and what are the exact boundary conditions being specified. However I assume you mean What are some physically relevant ODEs or PDEs that are commonly treated in a fifthorder form. ,math,d2z6rfl,1,t5_2qh0n

An alternate take on your question might be questions people have asked in the past and later formalizedmade concrete. What is the real line exactly? What is infinity? Are there different sizes of infinity? All of these questions have some frameworkmodel surrounding them that you might argue is a more concrete interpretation of the initial abstract question.

I also love the duality of intuition and rigorous reasoning both of which are often necessary to create a solid proof. Right now Im going back and selfstudying Control Theory need it for my EE PhD candidacy but never took it because I was a CEG undergrad and working those problems is just so mechanical and uninteresting relative to the real analysis I study for fun.EDIT I also love how math is like a giant logical structure resting on a small number of axioms and you can study various parts of it at various levels. I liken it to how a computer works which levels with each higher level resting on those below it.

7762017,0,t3_4l0d1k,Hi I note someone already answered your question about a differential equations approach to the socalled Euler equations.ampnbspThought Id mention another definition of the complex numbers is to consider the Euclidean plane with a marked origin and then each complex number is a motion of the plane a function from the plane to itself. If you already have constructed the complex plane Im just talking about for each complex numer c the function of multiplying by c that is which sends z to cz.ampnbspThe set of functions if you havent already constructed the complex plane are just those which fix the origin and scale distances by a constant possibly zero real amount.ampnbspThat is if E is the plane with origin  a function fEgtE which satisfies f and such that there is a nonnegative real number u such that for all abin E  distancefafb  u.distanceab.ampnbspThe operation of complex multiplication is just the composite of such functions and the operation of complex addition is just vector addition meaning if fg are two such functions then fg is defined so that fgx  fxgx where the sum is vector addition in E using the chosen element  as an origin.ampnbspThe tricky thing is to show that fg also rescales distances by a constant factor. It is this fact that is special about the plane and cant work for higher dimensional Euclidean spaces with the functions commuting under composition and all being bijections except the function sending every element to . That is you can construct the reals and the complex numbers this way.,math,d3ohbim,1,t5_2qh0n

It has both a a great community writing numerical code and b a huge range of available libraries for doing anything else you can imagine.IMO the best way to learn to program is to give yourself small projects  could be a numerical computation an image effect a simple little game some kind of automation of a manual task you need to perform ... almost anything really. The key is to start with something you can finish in no more than a few days of work. If you do a few dozen tiny trivial projects youll start to get a sense of what else is possible and how to find help. Google and IRC are a programmers best friends there are people sitting around bored at work just waiting to help you when you get stuck.While learning to code focus on using peoples existing libraries rather than trying to handle all the numerical algorithms yourself. The goal should be to solve whatever problem you set out as quickly as possible and become comfortable with the activity and concepts. Youll have many decades more time in the future to do things from scratch if you want and your coursework will presumably include plenty of algorithmic work.Perhaps look up undergraduate computer science courses if you feel you need some structure.,math,d3xkx0i,2,t5_2qh0n

For math students the actual content of calculus used by engineers and such should be easy as cake and they better be focusing on the proofs which are the hard part. If math majors arent focusing on the proofs it will catch up with them at some point and their hopes of being a successful mathematician will come crashing down. For the rest of students calculus isnt just about doing the derivatives and integrals. Its about learning to think better.

7927463,0,t3_4nu7lx,Axioms can be justified in a few ways. The justification I find most compelling isWe start with an intuitive notion of some mathematical concept. We all know what it means for a function to be continuous long before we learn how epsilondelta proofs work and we all have some notion of what a collection of things is before we learn about set theory. Any axiomatization of arithmetic that fails to prove that  is not an axiomatization of arithmetic at all. The intuition comes first. Then we ask what is a minimal collection of formal rules and statements required to describe this intuitive notion? Formalising our intuitive understanding of mathematics allows us greater certainty that mathematical concepts are consistent allowing us to focus on the purely logical aspect of mathematical inquiry. David Hilbert famously said gt One must be able to say at all timesinstead of points straight lines and planestables chairs and beer mugsThere are philosophers who would take a different approach. Especially in the th and early part of the th Century there was a tendency to believe that axioms should somehow be selfevident or logical truths.

7975577,0,t1_d4cbk5i,Alright here goesFirst everyone agrees on a chosen bijection F between the naturals N and the set ... x N. Next they all consider the set of all realvalued sequences and the equivalence relation  where given sequences xn yn we say xn  yn iff there is some natural number k so that xj  yj for all jgtk. In other words sequences are equivalent when they agree after a finite number of terms. Then we use AC to pick a representative from each equivalence class. This is the sort of obvious part of the solution in the sense that every AC riddle starts essentially in this way with this exact equivalence relation or something close to it. Alright now I will describe the strategy by telling you what mathematician i does when she enters the ith room. Immediately she uses F to reindex the boxes by the set ... x N. So now every box is labeled with a pair ab with a between  and  and b some natural number. Now mathematician i will open up every box that does not have an i for its first coordinate. So mathematician i is seeing  different sequences of real numbers the one consisting of all numbers inside of a box with first coordinate  the one consisting of all numbers inside of a box with first coordinate .... skip the ith one.... the one consisting of all numbers inside of a box with first coordinate . Then mathematician i recalls the special representative for each of these  sequences. By definition of  for each of these sequences xn the corresponding special representative must agree with xn after some finite index. This determines a list of  finite natural numbers the indices after which each sequence agrees with its special representative. Then mathematician i adds all of these  numbers together and then adds  to that giant number just for good luck. This yields a number that we will call Pi this notation reminds us that mathematician js large number will probably be different from mathematician is. Ok so the only remaining closed boxes are the infinitely many with an i in the first coordinate. Mathematician i then opens up all of those boxes whose second coordinate is larger than Pi. So now mathematician i has seen the infinite tail of the sequence with an i for the first coordinate and this is enough information to determine the equivalence class of that sequence. So finally mathematician i will choose the box whose second coordinate is Pi and she will guess the number inside of it according to what that number should be for the special representative in the equivalence class of that sequence. So thats it. The only remaining question is why does this work? It works because mathematician i will be guessing a number in hisher own sequence whose index is much larger than the indices after which all of the other  sequences begin to agree with their special representatives. So lets suppose that mathematician i guesses incorrectly. That means that the index at which the ith sequence begins to agree with its representative is bigger than the sum of all of the places where the other sequences begin to agree with their reps. Well that sucks for mathematician i but then when mathematician j executes this strategy she will end up guessing at a spot which is far beyond where herhis sequence began to agree with the special rep since in particular she is guessing far beyond the index at which the ith srquence begins to agree with its special rep and by assumption this is a much bigger index than js agreement place. And therefore she will guess correctly. ,math,d4cj44c,30,t5_2qh0n

Many choices of k give you the same thingjust think of how many choices we had for the chosen generator b and that makes sensein fact there are at most two groups of order pqIts easy to show that a group of order p is abelian so there are at most two for those and now we have already codified                                                              of the  numbers all with one or two groups. In other words these nearly half the values will contribute significantly less than  groups towards the billions in the total before weve even looked at groups with three or more prime factors counted with multiplicity.And another constraint you cant have more than four distinct five factors.  which wont stay under the limit if we multiply it by .All this is largely irrelevant though. The first main point is to understand why a cardinality with ten prime factors counted with multiplicity has such a phenominally higher number of expected groups than a cardinality with nine or fewer. The data      Together this makes  of the  groups of order up to  or .. I.e. were looking at . with a paltry . to be made up by those other  orders that have at most nine prime factors. N.B. the groups of order  make up . the groups of order  make up . the groups of order  make up . the groups of order  make up .  and  have . amp . respectively and the last paltry . or approximately only  groups come from those numbers that have fewer than nine with repetition prime factors.So the main point to be explained is clearly Why does adding another prime factor increase the possibilities so greatly?And a second but also important point is Why does adding another of the same prime factor tend to win against adding a different prime factor of roughly the same order of magnitude?Burnsides theorem tells us that all groups of order paqb are solvable and weve seen that were really not extending too far beyond the bounds of this form so we can think of all this in terms of composition series whose factor groups quotients of successive groups in the series are all cyclic groups of prime order.  The JordanHlder theorem says that well find a canonical list of composition factors for a given group up to permutation. Notice that it does not say that if the list of composition factors is the same then the groups are isomorphic S would be a counterexample to that.In fact this proves that all the approximately  groups of order  have the same composition factors in their composition series C C C C C C C C C C. This does not of course mean that their composition series are the same and it does not mean that they can be written as semidirect products all the way up C for example is not a semidirect product of C.And so we ask ourselves the following question ten times in a row In what distinct ways can I get the group I have to sit normally as a subgroup of index  in a group twice the size?As we ask this question iteratively beware that it is not true that we get a tree. There are many loops even the example of the composition series for C on the Wikipedia page bears this out albeit not for a group of prime power index.If youve made it this far youll be disappointed to know that I dont know how to proceed from here. An answerer to this closely related question states that it has something to do with the fact that most groups in some sense of the word most have nilpotency class  you take the commutator of the group and the commutator of the group and itself to get a nontrivial commutative group.Ill come back to this if I think of anything good.,math,d4hrir3,113,t5_2qh0n

8086262,0,t3_4pyv61,gt Recently I started to depend a lot more to the proofs presented in books and websites like MSE which has been causing a huge guilt and fear that I am not making the knowledge into my own.I hear this a lot and I dont fully understand it. Its great to prove things on your own and well worth the effort if you can but you should not expect to be able to prove everything on your own. The proofs in these books have developed from the insights of not one but many brilliant minds. Isaac Newton humbly said that if he has seen further it is because he stood on the shoulders of giants. I think the same idea applies here. If you look at a theorem statement or problem and think you can prove it on your own then that is great and you should make the effort to do so but dont be afraid or guilty to seek help if you need it especially if this slows your learning overall. Your desire and willingness to to make this effort already puts you ahead of the game and trying to learn from others when you do reach and impasse can only be helpful. Learn how to balance the two approaches to maximize your learning and you may find that as you learn a particular subject you will rely less on the help of others to prove something. And certainly when you do prove something on your own read other proofs and compare them to your own learning from those who did it better and gaining confidence and pride when your proofs have similar or even novel approaches.,math,d4oywya,3,t5_2qh0n

A good example of this is whats being indirectly discussed ITT that when talking about incompleteness it leaves out the crucial assumptions about recursive enumerability of the axioms and the need to express enough arithmetic to code first order sentences within the language.I dont know of a source that goes into these per se and Im not sure such a thing would make that much sense to write.  GEB is a great way to get an idea of whats happening but its like reading a popscience book on quantum mechanics you dont actually know any hard science after reading it see e.g. half of rbadphysics.  Answering questions based on what it says would be like someone who has only heard limits described in the handwavy the graph gets close to a number way trying to explain why the derivative of sin is cos they wont be wrong so much as totally offbase.The best thing to do to fill in any gaps it left is to actually study logic properly.

So when A says I dont know my number he is telling B Your number is not the same as Cs.Since the number B gives is odd the information A gave must be vital to finding their own number. Again it can be either the sum or difference of the other numbers. The only way his number could be the same as Cs is if Cs number is half As. Since B only needs the information that Cs number is not the same as their own Bs number must be the sum of the other twos and Cs is half of As. Therefore A and C have  and  respectively.,math,d5fqcsn,1,t5_2qh0n

This is true on Q rational numbers and R reals and C complex numbers but its not always true. There are fields where it doesnt hold. For example the integers mod  or any prime p form a field where for example            and      and   . If a field has     ...     with p s then we call it characteristic p. Above is a finite field called F with characteristic . If thats not the case then          ... and so on are all distinct numbers this means that the field is at least countable and thats called characteristic .You shouldnt worry about this for linear algebra though. This comes later in abstract algebra groups rings and fields. I personally think that  should be considered a natural number. Why? The natural numbers come from set theory a base case that is the empty set  and a successor operation Sx  x U x. The natural numbers are constructed like this             U            U       ... and so on. We call the counting numbers natural because we dont have to do anything to construct them to get negative integers and rational numbers we need equivalence classes to get the reals we need to talk about secondorder analytictopological properties around least upper bounds. They emerge naturally from ZFC set theory. By the way everything I said is far more advanced than what you need to learn linear algebra. This is typically covered in the math structuresproofs class or the first real analysis course. You wouldnt see a not characteristic  field in a typical linear algebra course. ,math,d5l9ep1,12,t5_2qh0n

And for the operation lets just take your standard definition of multiplication. Closure This means that if we multiply any two numbers in our set together well end up with another number in the set. So any two rationals multiplied together will always be rational e.g. youll never get an irrational number by multiplying two rationals together.. Associativity For any three rational numbers a b and c abcabc. Identity Somewhere in our set theres an element which when multiplied onto any other number gives that number.

Given a matrix whose entries are elements of an arbitrary commutative ring the determinant still tells you if the matrix is invertible. But instead of requiring it to be nonzero its simply required to be invertible.The parity or sign function for the symmetric group of order n can be defined directly. The usual approach requires first you prove each element decomposes into transpositions and each decomposition has the same number of factors. To demonstrate well take S where we define sgn   x  xx  xx  x  x  xxxxx where x x and x are indeterminantes and xi is used to denote xj where j  i.

A second time rolling gets again a . probablity of succeding at getting any number.

8588188,0,t1_d6ey65m,You can prove that the Russel set must not exist without any axioms at all i.e. with only the language of set theory and underlying logic. If it did exist you would have contradictory statements  R in R  and  neg R in R  that imply one another. This cannot be so the Russel set cannot exist in any consistent set theory. Note that regularity is not required for this argument.If you accept unrestricted comprehension as an axiom then it says the Russel set along with any other set I can write down does exist and here is where we have the actual contradiction. The contradiction in the above paragraph just shows the Russet set cannot exist its a proof by contradiction. The contradiction here is that unrestricted comprehension says it does exist but we already know it cannot. Thus it is a necessary condition of having a consistent set theory that unrestricted comprehension is not an axiom.So you are correct in saying that the subset axiom fixes unrestricted comprehension by well restricting it. However you arent fixing any paradox by adding the subset axiom. There is no paradox without unrestricted comprehension. The subset axiom is introduced in its place to make our set theory more interesting without introducing contradictions at least we would hope.The class of all sets on the other hand could exist depending on what axioms you use. If you have the subset axiom then we know it cannot exist because universal set  subset axiom  unrestricted comprehension all over again. If you use regularity then such a set clearly cannot exist since it would contain itself  this is the easiest argument. With the powerset axiom a universal set would contradict Cantors theorem as you pointed out since its powerset would have to be a subset and thus of no larger cardinality.HOWEVER if you throw out subset powerset and regularity then I believe it is consistent to have a universal set. I bring this up only to illustrate the relationship between paradoxes and various axioms and how some objects Russel set vs universal set are worse than others.,math,d6f41u7,9,t5_2qh0n

So I changed my degree from computer science to mathematics with an emphasis in computer science I would get the best of both worldsMaking this change was a good choice for me.  I am now a senior with four courses to go before I graduate all four are computer science courses.  All of the undergrad proof courses at my school were pretty easy and fun.

The idea that being able to churn results from an algorithm is a lowly task and that only truly brilliant people understand the mysterious beauty and intricacies of maths hurts the practice of math by the general population.

The main difference is that in academic research you are more or less solely responsible for generating  of your own research problems whereas at Microsoft other people usually product teams will supply some problems for you to work on more accurately supply your bosses with some problems to work on and your bosses will allocate the problems among the research staff yes this means your bosses are technically competent. It ends up being maybe a  split between solving problems of your own choice and solving problems from external sources. Its not a regular corporate job because the problems that the company gives you are really longterm things like  year time horizons very unusual in modern business which is normally dominated by next quarters earnings.Keep in mind that academic research is as much about finding problems as solving them so getting a large chunk of problems from somewhere else is actually very significant.,math,d6xafdm,4,t5_2qh0n

8757965,0,t1_d70bps0,For example in a comment Qiaochu saysgtokay so find a topological theorem you find interesting it does not have to be pointset topology e.g. it might be the computation of the fundamental group of the circle and backtrack to learn all of the topology you need to understand the proof of the theoremThis backtracking approach seems to be used by a lot of really smart people.  Heres a description of how the mathematician Peter Scholze who is said to be revolutionizing arithmetic geometry learns mathgtAt  Scholze learned that a decade earlier Andrew Wiles had proved the famous thcentury problem known as Fermats last theorem which says that the equation xn  yn  zn has no nonzero wholenumber solutions if n is greater than two. Scholze was eager to study the proof but quickly discovered that despite the problems simplicity its solution uses some of the most cuttingedge mathematics around. I understood nothing but it was really fascinating he said.    gtSo Scholze worked backward figuring out what he needed to learn to make sense of the proof. To this day thats to a large extent how I learn he said. I never really learned the basic things like linear algebra actually  I only assimilated it through learning some other stuff.    Elon Musk who has created a grade school called Ad Astra makes some interesting related comments in this video    gtLets say youre trying to teach people about how engines work. A more traditional approach would be to say were going to teach all about screw drivers and wrenches and youre going to have a course on screw drivers a course on wrenches and all these things and that is a very difficult way to do it. A much better way would be like heres the engine now lets take it apart how are we going to take it apart? Ah we need a screw driver thats what the screw drivers for. We need a wrench thats what the wrench is for.

8818602,0,t3_50xlxw,Luck could mean different things. Maybe it just means that for a given event her odds are constantly better than a normal persons for some reason. I would want to explore the metaphysics of that to give an explanation why thats true and probably expose some exploitable vulnerability.A more fun possibility is to play into the gamblers fallacy and make the key metaphysical difference between our world and the fictional one is that the fallacy is TRUE. So flipping a coin twice is not two independent events but ones that are perhaps based on some intrinsic amount of luck that the flipper has which gets used up. Maybe the mathematician discovers a gauge theory for this principle of conservation which allows him to estimate the amount of luck she has left in particular circumstances. Another cute question for the metaphysics isdoes the luck regenerate after being used or do you have to obtain it from something else? Or someone else? Maybe theres something she does to scam some luck from the guys who well...you can explore that on your own. Then within this world theres another questiondoes she consciously spend luck? More generally since luck is defined from her perspective whats the mechanism events that burn up luck and the choice to engage in that? Lets say she has a stock portfoliois that constantly consuming luck for her? Or is it a specific willed thing? Exploring questions like this might help elucidate an answer about how the mathematician can interact with the problem at hand. Also you might want to consider that in this world there are probably a lot of mathematicians and if this phenomenon is common they will have journals with a history of research on the subject.

8978937,0,t1_d7qzhzy,Id also like to retract my retraction. The union of two multisets of prime factorizations gives the lcm not the product.I wrongly corrected this statement earlier because upon skimming the Wikipedia article I saw the definition of multiset sum take the sum of the functions and thought they were taking that as for sum. But a closer reading shows that the article statesgtThe concepts of intersection union subset cartesian product and cardinality of multisets are defined by the above formulas.and the above formula referenced for union is max of the indicator functions.Hence multiset union is max and on prime factorizations it gives LCM not product. The product is given by the multiset sum not the union.,math,d7r4qs4,2,t5_2qh0n

9039054,0,t3_54243x,By fake definition of continuity I assume you were thinking of the statement that continuity means you can draw a graph without lifting the pencil off the paper. When I have taught calculus I mentioned the definition in terms of a limit of fx as x gt a being fa and I also mention the fake definition.  There is nothing wrong with the fake definition alongside the actual one about limits since it provide intuition about what the idea behind continuity is no jumps in the graph.  Frankly for almost anyone other than a mathematician the fake definition has more meaning than the rigorous one ever will. It is pedagogical absurdity to treat math as a subject containing only rigor with no attempt to convey the intuitions and ideas that led to the rigor in the first place.  Heck mathematicians did not have rigorous definitions of limits derivatives or even real numbers for hundreds of years after calculus developed.  Are you puzzled how progress could be made with only a fake nonrigorous understanding?  It is no surprise since people knew what they wanted to be talking about even if they could not meet the rigorous standards of today.  Halmos in his book I Want to be a Mathematician wrote about how he finally understood the meaning of a concept whose strict definition he had read but did not understand at all I had been trying to understand rectifiable curves and I was confused by the sums and absolute values and inequalities and upper bounds all over the page. ... In a conversation among a bunch of us rectifiable curves came up again and I must have looked vague and troubled.  Joe Doob must have sensed it. He turned to me and said has length. That did it. It made the reading I had been doing fall into place.  I was delighted when I read that because I too had seen definitions and theorems about rectifiable curves in my math classes but did not appreciate what the point was and now I too finally understood what rectifiable curves were all about.  With the informal idea I could more clearly understand the rigor but not the other way around.Consider what Lebesgue once said in an address he gave on measure theory If one were reduced to pure logic which does not permit a choice among all things that are exact one would hardly think of many questions and certain notions ... would escape us completely. A nonrigorous or informal understanding of concepts is often so crucial to being able to follow the rigor or appreciate it or as Lebesgue pointed out even to create it.You want us to teach people the truth about math. Well the truth is that being able to teach requires you not to treat students like automatons who can only understand logic but as human beings who need to know what the freaking point of something is before they are psychologically ready to work with strict definitions.  I suspect you have never taught people who are not intending to become mathematicians or perhaps even not taught a math course at all.  Ive come across a number of math students with no teaching experience who think like you appear to that the right way to teach math is to use full rigor right from the start.

This reasoning was arguably a bit sloppy in places but having found the answer we can now check it really works if x  bx  c has double root r then xerx satisfies y  by  cy  .

9500177,0,t3_5ax3ut,gtMy TA skips so many steps when solving some problems when I desperately need to see them in order to retain the information for later. I guess he thinks theyre easy or that if youre taking the class you should intuitively understand what he did or get the fuck out. In fact hes blatantly admitted this sentiment to us before. Pretentious as fuck. As a teacherTA you simply cannot reproduce every single step of a computationderivation for every problem. You spend all day doing last years math and never get to the current stuff. In a calculus course you need to assume that your students have a basic mastery of the  algebratrig symbolpushing so that they can either connect the dots for themselves in real time or momentarily take your word for it confident that they can connect the dots later on their own when they have more time. In Calc II that extends to derivative computations and some easier antiderivativeintegral problems. In all college math courses that Ive ever been a part of its considered reasonable to assume that a student has roughly mastered the material from last week.Also understand that it is extraordinarily difficult to explain to someone that their skills are lacking without offending them. Especially in a math class where everyone is already anxious. When your TA says I dont have time to go over that this is something you should have mastered before this class there is no subtext ... at least not the kind that youre reading into it. Heshe means exactly what was said. There is not time. The skills required to complete this computation are ones that you have already mastered. The only implications are that  you can likely fill in the gaps when you get home and  you have some catching up to do if you cant fill in those gaps. There is no intent to demean demoralize or otherwise imply that you are a lesser person.

Speaking from experience the kind of environment you get when you apply a policy like that is exactly the kind of thing that deters women and minorities from STEM subjects which hurts everyone I mean from a sheer numerical perspective you lose out on over half of the best minds if you exclude over half of the people.

Its not even clear what the mathematical connection between prime numbers and even integers is except for the heuristic argument you described.I would agree with you that if one knows some basic properties about the distribution of primes then its obviously true that Goldbachs conjecture holds for all sufficiently large even integers.I think the twin prime conjecture is obviously true because why would twin primes just stop after a certain point?

It might not be I have no proof that it is but its very very very likely that its irrational.On the other hand if someone come up to me with an image of a person and ask me to bet  if hes a serial killer or not I wont take that bet because I dont trust you to have chosen him randomly.  He probably wouldnt be offering the bet with a random person he possibly picked a serial killer on purpose.Most of the numbers you see commonly are rational     etc.  But thats only because theyre not chosen randomly theyre chosen because theyre easy to work with and describe and apply to real life situations.   is the smallest positive integer   is   .   is  divided by   These are rational because they have simple basic properties that make them obviously rational.  e  pi is not obviously rational.

In fact there are three notions of almost everywhere commonly used in algebraic geometry properties that hold at a general point properties that hold at a very general point properties that hold on a dense subset.gt I fail to see how any morphism dominant or otherwise has anything to do with what I said. Since we work in a context where knowing what happens on the underlying sets doesnt give all the relevant information we routinely consider an inclusion morphism instead of a subobject.  So instead of a dense subset wed consider the inclusion of a dense subset which is a dominant morphism.  Usually it doesnt actually help to use the fact that the morphism is an inclusion so well prove a more general result.,math,dbhf4fp,1,t5_2qh0n

Substituting for sqrt this gives v  u  vu we therefore get v  uu  .From that reducing it to an appropriate sum of powers should be easier.As far as the second question...  thats not going to be a subset of the algebraic numbers because you have valid elements of the extension for which an infinite subset of the primes for example all primes of the form k are used.

10418099,0,t1_dcox1w1,Ok that first example is pretty cool and doesnt seem like youre just injecting set theory into algebra to find such a result.And my strong objection was having to reject all choice since some of the models of ZF plus various negations of choice have way more counterintuitive results than ZFC. Countable unions of  element sets are uncountable? Fun place to visit but I dont want to have to live there. I have only mild objections to having to only reject choice larger than say countable or dependent choice which are more about how we formulate out mathematical objects as you say. I rarely need any cardinalities bigger than say Beth. Although I still think the statements All vector spaces have bases etc. are more natural and obviously true and useful than having to append some restriction on the underlying sets. But I admit thats totally a personal preference.Im actually a geometric group theorist so I really dont need big sets at all. I do really like nonmeasurable sets and nontrivial solutions to Cauchys equation though. As for Wiles Ill grant you an inaccessible cardinal or do I need to go one higher to get a Universe? rather than take them all.Philosophically there is one big reason to prefer choice over large cardinals. ZFC is relatively consistent over ZF but ZFlarge cardinal isnt. So at worse Choice does no new harm whereas your favorite large cardinal might introduce an inconsistency and has once in the past. The same can be said for omega but I think theres a necessity argument for AoI that the large cardinal axioms dont have as strongly.Anyhow to reiterate if Im doing set theory Im fine accepting as many of your favorite lage cardinals as you like. If Im doing anything else Im excited if a natural question ends up being independent of ZFC and want to jump up and down about it and Id like to know what the large cardinals say but not enough to give up Choice for it. Ok maybe some choice. ,math,dcoyk7y,6,t5_2qh0n

For all x in such a set all fx will look exponential but when you combine it all you could get points all over the place.For example lets say tau  . Then    ... could follow some exponential pattern. If f   then f   f   f   etc...but if we fit this to an exponential f. would be sqrt. Instead we can define it to be anything we want and then define f. f. f....to fit the pattern. If we do this your condition would still be met but the function would be noncontinuous and therefore if my vague understanding of analytic functions is correct nonanalytic.If we did define f. as sqrt and f. as  etc though the function ought to be exponential.Update I made this in Desmos which shows a noncontinuous function that meets your condition.

But if you look at current research in abstract algebra its equally difficult to get up to speed and comprehend.

There are some who care about applying exotic logics to quantum mechanics like I mention elsewhere but most do not.However in the map theres commutative algebra right next to quantum physics which doesnt make that much sense to me.

When hes stuck on a problem he always says OK so what do we know? and writes the entire thing over again. And again. And again.What he never does is stop and think for a minute.This is the real hard work right here. If your pencil is moving thats resting time for your brain. Thinking is the hard step. And thinking isnt a monolithic thingthere are multiple modes. Sometimes you need to really really buckle down and think something through very closely and logically.

That being saidOn the unit circle if you have some angle theta then sin of theta represents the heightor distance from the x axis at the point where a line with angle theta in relation to the x axis from the origin touches the unit circle. Cosine of theta represents the distance from the y axis to the point where the line touches the unit circle. Of course tangent is the slope of a line tangent to the point where the line touches the unit circle. Its slope will be rise over run. Rise is of course sin and run is of course cosine. Tangent is just sin over cosine. You can imagine how these values change for different values of theta. At  some of theta is  because the point the line makes with the unit circle is no distance from the x axis while cosine of theta is  at  because the point is exactly one away from the x axis. Tangent of theta is of course .And sin of pi or more naturaly Tau    a fourth of a circle.

Lets say a question is factor x   and your solution is x  x  and x  . All you need to do is just pick  numbers lets say  and  and see if they yield the correct answer.So    and            and         while it is possible you would make an error that generates a right answer for one of the values it is very difficult to find one that would yield correct answers for both numbers and be one that you just errored into.And I realize for many problems they arent this easy but there are always sanity checks and ways to check each answer that take no more time than coming up with the solution.EDIT interestinglyAND VERY HUMBLING I was shown that errors have a way of creeping in by using my post as an example. so I edited them for clarity.But if I were to write a new post it would be something like this.Proofreading is an important an often overlooked portion of tasks we perform.

Vakil in personal correspondence to me Aug   The license and my wishes are intended to be very open so theres no obstruction there.But Id still ask that you to do some variant of this instead for different reasons. If you post your answers on the web it is inevitable that others who will be learning the same material in the future will flip too quickly to your solutions and not struggle themselves.

The process of becoming depressed is slow and insidious and it can take several yearsmonths. Its not a strict downward spiral there are ups and downs  sometimes weeks of relief. But on the whole Id say youre going down and the sooner your realize it the sooner you can working on reversing the spiral. Its sort of like a brain tumor. In the beginning nothing really changes and you can function mostly normal. After some time obstacles start to crop up avoidable at first and negotiable for the most part. But since the tumor is in your brain it also effects your ability to selfdiagnose and as the symptoms worsen so does your ability to recognize that youre getting worse. More time passes and the obstacles impeding you to continue your old life have grown insurmountable and as a result youve given up. But with this devastating loss of normality the tumor has also completely stolen your selfinsight. You adapt to your new  much degraded  reality but the tumor isnt done. It keeps eating your brain attacking it with anxiety until you seriously consider the only recourse of a sick human who suffers but does not know how to help himself  suicide. Seriously you can stop this. But you need help from someone who know how to help your mental disease.

Both of those do modules which are just a generalization of vector spaces being defined over rings instead of fields. Each of those books covers everything youd want to know about multilinear algebra. Although I would recommend Dummit and Foote since Hungerford is a bit unnecessarily technicalabstract in his definition a ring doesnt have an identity.If you plan to learn more of the geometry aspect then I would recommend Lees Smooth Manifolds.

11468388,0,t3_63hhdg,While this may seem completely diverted from the question at hand I would suggest making sure that you get antique sleep if you want to solve tough problems. I highly encourage that you watch this video on sleep which goes through numerous benefits of sleep including its effects on your problemsolving skills. A lack of sleep leads to the slowing down of the firing of neurones in your prefrontal cortex which hinders your problemsolving skills in the sense that it makes it harder to look for alternative solutions. This of course may not apply to you but it is important to look out for. ,math,dfvxp1n,1,t5_2qh0n

11513520,0,t3_648mjo,When you ask for why you are presupposing the source of meaning for this activity lies elsewhere  that the doing of math gets its justification from something else. But I do it for the same reason as most of my peers just. and doing it is like doing anything worthwhile full of joys and frustration. Every why question generates a chain that must end somewhere for a lot of people it is pleasure or money etc. and for a lot of people the why simply ends in that activity itself. I think a problem with our modern society is that it makes all of us expect every chain of justification concerning any human activity to end in pleasure or something like that. I think in reality most people engage in activities for itself and confuse the attendant pleasure as the real reason when the feeling is simply a sideeffect.     ,math,dg12532,3,t5_2qh0n

11641079,0,t1_dgfi6ux,No. Thats not how axioms work. You take axioms for granted thats their entire point. Axioms are statements that you assume to be true. If you dont want to assume the axiom of infinity true then thats okay. Use a set theory where it isnt assumed. Further note that all statements made about ZFC sets are implicitly of the form if ZFC holds then... A system of axioms is nothing but a convention to have an implicit context of antecedents so we dont have to write them down every time.However not assuming an axiom doesnt mean that you assume its contrary. You can for many axioms show that they are independent of they underlying concepts. That is neither assuming the axiom nor assuming its negation is a contradiction. This is the case e.g. for the axiom of infinity and the axiom of choice.What you feel doesnt really matter in mathematics. If your intuition doesnt match what we can observe or prove then your intuition is incorrect. This happens quite often. And again something being obviously wrong doesnt constitute a proof. If you want please come up with a proof. If you dont want to bother with rigor then mathematics is perhaps not the right subject for you.,math,dgfj2zg,10,t5_2qh0n

11795467,0,t1_dgx16we,This doesnt seem homeworky at all to me.Id understand if you redirected them to the Simple Questions thread but I dont get redirecting them to homework subs.,math,dgx217i,7,t5_2qh0n
11798271,0,t1_dgxape2,How is the second one misleading? And the first is only misleading if you dont know what Algebra is. If you do its a pretty accurate title since its pretty basic as far as algebra texts go the first volume at least.,math,dgxdhsa,9,t5_2qh0n
11800971,0,t1_dgxo36f,At this point I think id have to say that it is possible since the convergence is almost sure. Im just more confused Also I dont see how the book agrees? They define impossible as only occurring when A is the empty set.And what about what Kolmogorov has to say?How also do you reconcile your definition of impossibility with the fact that we have the concept of almost surely? Maybe my logic is wrong here but it seems like if your definition of impossibility were correct wed have no need for such a concept  almost surely would just mean sure.edit Also could you point me towards other sources that argue for the same definition of impossibility as you? Ideally some that provide explanation.,math,dgxoiw4,1,t5_2qh0n
