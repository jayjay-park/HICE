9726564,0,t3_5dhxr3,She sang the worst of anyone at this point of the show I think.  I winced at her slightly flat notes.  If it were stylistic fine.  But its frequent and thankfully the charade is over.  The viewers know more than Miley.,thevoice,dac0ggd,2,t5_2toa3
9735209,0,t3_5dhxr3,I love her! Her voice is different from anyone else on the show this season. I enjoyed listening to her every week and I cannot wait to see what she comes out with. Maybe Im just weird but most of the other contestants just bore me exept maybe We. ,thevoice,dad2rx8,1,t5_2toa3

9981704,0,t3_5iimcy,First of all I get annoyed by binary likehate characterization. I can dislike someone without hating them and I dislike Miley. I am thoroughly annoyed by her excessive chatter and her stage mom antics starting to rub off on Alicia. That said I do appreciate her devotion and skill at coaching though cloning herself on Darby was a big mistake.She worked hard to shed the Hannah Montana image Wrecking Ball but still does juvenile shit cat ear headbands jewels on her face most of her outfits. She justifies it with I just gotta be me  sure but so does Gaga without ever looking like a teenager.,thevoice,db8n7dd,2,t5_2toa3
