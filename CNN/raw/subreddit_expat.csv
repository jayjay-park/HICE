6917968,0,t3_49p7de,Heya!  Thanks for answering questions! Im American living in the UK for postgrad.  I worked in the US last year and filled my taxes normally for that.  So if I stay here after graduation fall  and work can you ELI how the taxes work for next year?  I know there are a lot of rules etc but just the basic idea is what Im after.  Do I pay taxes in both countries?  The council tax we all pay here in the UK ambulance police roads trash etc based on property sizevalue do I report that I paid that? Any info you could provide would be great! Thank you so much!,expat,d10h3r6,1,t5_2qsu1

7959933,0,t3_4ns6m3,OP both sound like amazing opportunities.  Perhaps you should consider a few other things about living in another country.  Ill give a quick list of things that surprised me when I moved from U.S. to Chile  years ago not necessarily specific to Chile just things to consider in general If you decide you want a parttime job will that interfere with your student visa?  Will there be any restrictions to what you can do while youre in the country other than study? How often do you hope to visit your family and how much of an expense will this be from each of your potential locations? Is the climate in one place preferable to the climate in the other place?  Really think about it because I came to Chile only to find out that central heating isnt really a thing here yet P If you dont speak the official language natively how quickly will you be able to learn it?  Do you have experience traveling without being able to speak the language?  Is there a large difference in the cost of living between the places?  Is this important to you? What things might you have to give up in one place but not in the other driving for instance. Thats all Ive got.  Youve got to make the choice thats best for you and I hope that you identify it soon and without any doubts hanging around in the back of your mind!  Living abroad is such an eyeopening experience and either place that you choose is going to set you up for a great future!edit spelling ,expat,d4arsat,1,t5_2qsu1

8351790,0,t3_4t80hw,I dont have family of my own yet but I feel your pain! While my mum and I are really close she has a hard time letting go especially when I was the last sibling to leave the house I moved from Canada to England and shes had a hard time. I make sure we email very frequently post photos on Facebook so she can seefeel involved with what Im doing and we Skype about once a week or so. I also post on a blog www.adventuresandnaps.com so she can feel connected with my life while away.Its always a tradeoff. I love my life in England but I DO miss my parents siblings etc. You just have to find ways to make it work!,expat,d5liz7f,2,t5_2qsu1

10573868,0,t1_dd4vf65,I was going to say that I probably wouldve sold them to purchase new ones for where I was going to be living assuming I would be there for a long enough period. Doesnt seem practical at this point unless OP is willing to pay shipping to send them to whoever is willing to buy them however which I imagine isnt cheap. Can either hang onto them until next trip over to the UK to visit familyfriends while buying new appliances for the Phillipines and take them with her then to leave there or get a converter for the plug but be extremely careful to not blow any fuses. ,expat,dd6m157,1,t5_2qsu1
