In this regard I learned to not just start with the mantra but to first set the right view generating Bodhicitta with the verses....May all sentient beings have happiness and its causes.May all sentient beings be free from suffering and its causes.May all sentient beings never be separated from sorrowless bliss.May all sentient beings abide in equanimityfree of bias attachment and anger and share with others compassion.Id consider doing more though if you think it would help.,vajrayana,cisn610,4,t5_2uaj7
