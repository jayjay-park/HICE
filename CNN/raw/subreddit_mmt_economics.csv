2395763,0,t3_2msegp,The highpowered money approach to credit creation usually assumes that commercial banks will not carry excess reserves recent history has demonstrated that banks can and do carry excess reserves... Under high powered money assumptions its as if commercial bank lending is reserve limited. But it is not. You ought to read the Bank of England paper and Standard and Poors paperA couple key facts to help set the stage for you in the US and UK economies EU is different Reserves are issued by the central bank and circulate among commercial banksCommercial banks issue deposits which circulate among households and businesses.High powered money is a term that refers to reserves but implies that that money has more capability than it actually does have.,mmt_economics,cm7to6q,3,t5_2t76b
4233144,0,t3_39dasy,Fed govt increase SS  fund when it pays it back with interest.  A trick to increase SS without outright funding it since SS is independent and self funding.  Federal reserve lends as a last resort.  Fed discount rate always higher than money market or fed fund rate.   Fed reserve pays all profits back to treasury. ,mmt_economics,cs2rkms,2,t5_2t76b

5200668,0,t3_3m4c83,Havent watch the video but read what you wrote. Indeed classical author such as Marx and Ricardo a lot of what you mentioned may be thought as human work creating value but not all work is socially necessary as IkeLives says.This was thought searching for an objective value measurement in classical thinking is work itself what creates value sometimes use value when cooking in my house some with intended exchange value value socially necessary. Marx points the difference between the two as one of the inherent contradiction of capitalism.This eventually derive on the cost of production as one objective measurement of value because work is not the only mean of production it is added interest capital land.Money on the other hand is just a representation of exchange value not value per s it considers only commercial transactions between people.Historically economist gave up trying to have an objective way of measure value and ended up with subjective value theory as the way of explaining the difference between use and exchange value.Other thing to consider is positive externalities which is social value created but left unpay and hard to measure in terms of money.,mmt_economics,cvcvgne,2,t5_2t76b
6972621,0,t3_4b7byr,No its way off. MMT believes in endogenous theory of money which means that commercial banks and borrowers effectively decide the amount of broad money in the economy not the central bank. The central banks primary tool is the overnight interest rate which works through price. So the central bank cannot work through quantity it has to work through price.,mmt_economics,d16omm9,1,t5_2t76b
