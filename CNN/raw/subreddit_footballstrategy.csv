2055789,0,t1_cl14dvi,I should have linked an old thread but I remember doing a discussion on here about this a long time ago.  Anyways...The technique system is a concept used to easily tell defenders where to align and for some coaches how to play after the snap.  Primarily its for alignment however.  The system was around earlier but is most notable for coming into popularity thanks to Buddy Ryan and his defenses the  mastermind.Its a numbered system going from low to high.  Low numbers are more inside alignments and high numbers are for more outside alignments.Odd numbersOdd numbers are outside shades.  That means the defender aligns on his defender but in the gap to the outside.  Another way coaches will say it is to align with their eyes over the outside shoulder of the offensive lineman.tech Shade the centertech Outside shade of guardtech Outside shade of tackletech Outside shade of TEEven numbersEven numbers are heads up alignments.  That means the defender aligns with his eyes directly across from the Olinemans eyes.tech heads up on centertech heads up on guardtech heads up on tackletech heads up on TEEvenI numbersEven numbers with an I tagged to them mean to align on an inside shade.  The defender aligns his eyes over the defenders inside shoulder.i inside shade of guardi inside shade of tacklei inside shade of TE.  HOWEVER in Buddy Ryans system he refers to this as a technique as well.  There is some changeups when you get to the outside numbers.  Buddys system also doesnt feature an technique either.Gaps DCBAABCDLineOOOXOOOEvensOddsIiiiiBy adding a  to a technique that gives you a LB alignment.  So a  technique would be a LB aligning over the center or a  would be a LB aligning on an outside shade to a tackle.Normally which ever gap the technique puts the defender in that is the gap they are assigned to defend.  In an even technique defenders can either shoot inside or outside to their assigned gap or they can be coached to play the Olineman squared up and defend the gap to both sides gapping.  When a defender IS aligned in a gap lets say the Cgap a technique would defend the Cgap and attack through the tackles outside shoulder.  If he was in a  or i technique he is also in and has the Cgap but he attacks the TEs inside shoulder.To get more in depth the common stance is to take whatever arm that is nearest to the defender you are shadingtowards the shoulder you will be attacking and to put that arm on the ground point stance.  So a tech would put his inside arm towards the tackle down and a i technique would put his outside arm towards the TE down.,footballstrategy,cl14wlz,6,t5_2ubiw

TE or inside receiver opposite runs a drag with a skinny post or curl for the far receiver.  The inside receiver will occupy the near safety every time so the CB is forced to be on with the skinny which has a double move built in.  Its two concepts in one.

3329976,0,t3_2y9qh4,It is possible but you require a good DE and a good pass rushing LBer. Thing is a DE and correct me if I am wrong in this case is a bit larger than a LBer and as such not as agile or quick that decreases the effectiveness of the zone and the LB is typically worse at rushing the passer. Mostly in less personnel games there is more room to cover so more chance of error and such big plays. As such I would only do it if I had a guy at DE who could cover a WR one on one if not there is just too much wiggle room and it usually creates a big play for them. IF you have a D lineman just saw you say you have LB play DL those guys would be ideal who could match up it is possible to send him to cover the flats i.e. defeat the rub and slant stuff.i.e. line a DE up at the  tech over the end man on the short side of the field he engages by slanting outside to cover the B gap then drops to flat check run then bail the other DE slants from the  to engage the C and the OLB goes A gap and fights through the RB to the QB.

6203553,0,t3_40jj66,Vertical pass protection isnt something you just check to.  It is technique and a complete system for pass protection.  Its like defenses choosing to be a spill or box defense or an offense choosing to be wingT or option oriented.  You cannot just switch back and forth because they contradict everything you teach.  Most teams who do not originally have vertical pass protection as their base concept of pass pro will likely never use it.  ,footballstrategy,cyus0nr,4,t5_2ubiw

6860311,0,t1_d0tp6ts,Nearly all college and professional football teams use spill defenses and most base out of zone coverages.  By playing zone you allow your LBs and safeties to read the box so when they see the spill they can react quicker.Really with both box and spill defenses you have a risk playing man coverage its the universal risk of man coverage Like you said the DBs are keying receivers and running with them if they show pass.  You arent necessarily forced out of the bear front against double slots either.  Virginia Tech ran with Ohio State for most of their game last year in a bear front  box.  Its really a brilliant idea and a great option if you have a good secondary and a sound pass defense.  Every single gap is filled and it is extremely difficult to get that lone linebacker unless you use a slot to crack him.    ,footballstrategy,d0txbp8,2,t5_2ubiw
7268811,0,t1_d1zxzts,That gets lost in a lot of post game threads about why didnt they just do this instead. Its almost like a road of least resistance thing coordinators call plays suited to their own philosophy based on the most likely defensive call. What I absolutely love seeing is teams like Alabama. Kiffin loves calling two separate concepts on opposite sides of a balanced formation and thats quite useful for situational football. Just like defensive coordinators can come out in a quarters look and split the coverage play man on one side with  read on the other cover  on one side with  read on the other trap coverage on one side and cover  on the other  read on both sides etc offensive coordinators have slowly started similar thing with passing theories. I caught on to this after Alabama motioned to what certainly seemed to be a sprint out pass with a pick being set to open up the halfback in the flat. Defense ended up running Banjo coverage so switching up coverage while playing man so the pick is neutralized and the quarterback immediately looked to the other side of the formation and just threw a dart to his split receiver on a double move defender was again playing banjo and incorrectly stopped covering him expecting a pick and just got torched,footballstrategy,d24ewqy,2,t5_2ubiw
8922835,0,t1_d7jrmg8,About the run n shoot though many of its concepts have been taken by other systems.  You rarely see true run n shoot systems anymore but components of it are everywhere.  The levels concept is a run n shoot core concept but nearly anyone who relies on a decent amount of passing likely has it in their arsenal.  Same goes for the go and switch concept.EDIT The Run n shoot IS NOT flexbone option based!  .  The Run n Shoot came first.  It goes all the way back to the s.  As the Brophy article states Tiger Ellison put it together.  He wanted an offense that was fun for his players so he took the component of backyard football option routes and scrambling QBs and built a system out of it.  He was one of the first to use an offense primarily based on four vertical threats in his formations x and x formations.  .  The flexbone arrived at Air Force where Fisher DeBerry wanted to take the wishbone a veer option based offense and incorporate a more dynamic passing version of the offense.  He saw the run n shoot and adapted the formation to his offense which became the flexbone option offense.  .  The run n shoot today is mostly seen in Paul Johnsons Georgia Techs offense.  At Hawaii where he was an assistant they were running the classic run n shoot.  They then started borrowing ideas from Fisher DeBerry the inside veer and added their own series the rocket toss series.  As time went on they started to rely more on the option and rocket components and it eventually became the offense that Paul Johnson runs now.  Now it is a veeroption oriented offense that uses a passing game based off run n shoot concepts.  The two go together well because the two basic x run n shoot concepts verticals and switch look like the two perimeter blocking schemes for the inside veer arc blocking and switch blocking.  The term switch blocking is likely derived from the switch concept since PJ was running the pass concept first.My additions to this Air Raid systems typically use vertical pass protection where the entire Oline backpedals off the snap and resets at a certain depth.  Usually three steps back for a threestep pass and five steps back for a fivestep pass.   The Run n Shoot original versions at least relied on moving the pocket rollsprintout actions where the QB rolls to a certain side giving the offense a runpass option.   Air Raid flood the field with five receivers. Run n shoot Four receivers in route with the extra back blocking for the QB.  The QB run threat serves as the fifth option that would equate to the fifth receiver in the Air Raid.   Air Raid Tends to use more formations and personnel. Run n Shoot Less formations and almost exclusively WR sets.  The Buffalo Bills did run their version in the s the Kgun as a WRTE set.   Air Raid Routesconcepts are adjusted presnap based on the defensive alignment. Rather than adjusting presnap Run n shoot concepts revolve around the primary option route.  A receiver will read the defense postsnap and run a route based on those reads.  The QB reads the same defender the receiver does so he knows what route is going to be ran.  Other routes tend to clear out or attempt to draw defenders away from the option receiver so he only has to focus on one defender.  All receivers that arent directly involved in the pass concept so backside receivers or outside receivers on middleattacking concepts run go routes or some deep striking route.  With the Run n Shoot you always take the homerundeep ball if you can. Air Raid Horizontal stretch quick timed and controlled passes.   Run n Shoot Vertical stretching.  If you can throw deep throw deep.    ,footballstrategy,d7ke6xa,7,t5_2ubiw

10490514,0,t1_dcx54tx,Thats a good point.  I keep telling myself Julio is gonna get doubled and that will open it up for the run and leave LBs to cover the backs which is a mismatch.  But I didnt think of BB scheming against MR first.  Trying to take Ryan effectively out of the game.  He could play loose on Julio while sending pressure frequently and disguising coverages to eliminate the run and rattle Matty Ice.  However if can come up with this KS will be able to come up with a game plan that takes advantage.  All I know is the Falcons will have to come up with a way of winning which they do not typically use.
