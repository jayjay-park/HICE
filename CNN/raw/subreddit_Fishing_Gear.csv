7797028,0,t1_d3sf3d5,Thanks for the info. I looked into my states regulations and saw I needed a license. Do you know if you generally get the license same day or is there usually a waiting period. ,Fishing_Gear,d3sg1hy,1,t5_37vfu

11413370,0,t1_dfoemlo,For pike I believe they just hate anything flashy or Chartreuse so they attack it. For Bass the blades generally mimic a school of bait being chased through the water. The skirt provides the bait with a larger profile and also pulses in the water. ,Fishing_Gear,dfpp0fa,2,t5_37vfu
11438908,0,t3_63a06m,I know the best rod Ive ever had was an ugly stik  especially if your on a budget and I got a  Shimano Sienna FE for  on amazons warehouse deals . I spent less than  on my gear and I fish for everything in Washington with it.,Fishing_Gear,dfsl8au,1,t5_37vfu

11679054,0,t1_dg38b0m,Seconded.  My bootfoot silver labels are almost  yrs old abused the whole time and never leaked a drop.  Breathability is not what it was but only because I have not bothered to clean and re waterproof them.  Having said that  bucks wil get you nice set from any decent manufacturer like Simms Redington considered a value brand Orvis patagonia. Go to the shops try them on take your time.  Also check out Sierra Trading post they often have great deals but youll have tu o order them to try fitting.,Fishing_Gear,dgju5nx,1,t5_37vfu
