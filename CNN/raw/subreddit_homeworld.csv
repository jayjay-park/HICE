2404774,0,t1_cm8vt4x,The following is purely speculation based on the small amount of working with .iso files Ive doneI mean if you can dig into the CDs files the assets and sound files and stuff are probably in their own directories separate from the actual compiled executable. Youd need some way to decompile C code  Old C code  and figure out the Lua and maybe SCAR and I have no idea how hard any of those things are to do. Honestly it seems like HW Remastered is run by the developers and they probably dont have the time or money to sink into this which I totally get. Its a tiny bit disappointing but I feel like trying to do too much with the HW Remastered project would have meant it wouldnt happen at all.All in all Im more than happy.,homeworld,cm8xswb,2,t5_2re2q

2953686,0,t3_2tzrb3,I still have my orginal game and manual since it came out. It was the first I believe RTS game to have D space. As far as strategy there are elements such as mine laying cloacking hyperspacing scouting and even pirating enemy ships.Some of my more memorable days was my friend and I losing both our mother ships and only having a small carrier to fend with. We put both into patrol mode and played a game of hide and seek as he scattered the field with probes. He eventually rage quit but I always saw it as a great game.For any RTS games there are always interesting strategies to employ and between games like Command and Conquer Starcraft Warcraft Homeworld and other I have never employed the same strategies. Well I always start out using tank rush tactics but develop something completely different later on. Its all about your play style and adjusting to game mechanics.,homeworld,co3ujoe,2,t5_2re2q

2991097,0,t1_co80ccb,Indeed.I think the comparison you are looking for though is Alien gt Aliens.Same universe but different vibe. One was a horror survival the other was a military action horror.Homeworld  was this sweeping odysseyexodus tale. Homeworld Cataclysm was this zero to hero story with elements of horror thrown in.One of my favourite parts of Cataclysm was also that they confirmed the Bentusi were linked to their ships like SJet was. And made them more ironically human by giving them an enemy that scared the crap out of them even though they were still technologically superior.I do like some of the lore backstory for how the Hiigarans were supposed to have discovered the second core and tried using it to dominate their rivals the Taidanii and usurp the Bentusi as masters of the Galactic Council. That backstory also explained why the Bentusi gave up armed conflict and helped the Hiigarans return home because of their guilt at how the Taidanii and the Council treated the defeated people.However Homeworld s story was and is shit by comparison to almost every other homeworld mediaproduct. I really do hope that Homeworld Shipbreakers will be a return to form. And long term I would be interested in a Homeworld   Homeworld Online that explore the Age of SJet going into other galaxies.Note Also Cataclysms manual went into detail explaining how the Hiigarans established themselves after returning home. Really cool stuff.,homeworld,co80whe,3,t5_2re2q

Had to manually install this fix by first installing Microsofts compatibility assistant and then the fix itself and then running Cataclysm in OpenGL which would crash the game before all this.

3232901,0,t3_2x5lt5,While it would have been nice Gearbox did their best to work with the original code and update on top of it. Their focus was graphics UI some minor changes and multiplyer plus modding tools.This has nothing to do with supporting windowsonly development. It has to do with feasibility and cost of an aging cult classic.The work involved to make this useable with MacLinusSteamOS would be a completely different project scope and budget that didnt exist. Who knows how it was originally coded obviously with no porting in mind. I bet the team would have to put in a ton of development time and recreate the game for the other platforms.

3234355,0,t1_co4ahxa,The other reminder is that your base is able to move and user hyperspace to appear on the other side of the map if you so choose and have the resources. Traditional base building and ground tactics dont apply very well here.

3235818,0,t1_cox9z0t,Moreover you could order your cloak generators in a sphere formation then order a formation of larger ships to take up position in the same place and the formations would kind of meld.

3236771,0,t1_coxf266,It should do it supports ultra widescreen which at the least should work. AMDs eyefinity really just stitches all displays into one big one and then ads in bezel compensation pretty sure nVidia is the same.The main concern then is how the UI is scaled. Normally the devs will implement the scaling on a ratio of the display width so the total width of that stitched together display will dictate proportionally where to place the UI elements.My own specific concern is if the ratio suits the more popular  ratio monitors leaving people like me running  with bezel issues.Take Elite Dangerous for example. Their ratio suits  and ignores . As a result when viewing the galaxy map the UI menu that tells me all the info I need has the entire left edge cut off by the bezel but for anyone running  format monitors the whole UI is visible.I get around it by running in windowed mode and when I need to I shift the window over using the Altdrag app. That wouldnt work well with Homeworld though.,homeworld,coxhxyu,1,t5_2re2q

6309256,0,t1_cz6ryro,It means a lot! Without the fans Deserts of Kharak could not exist. Its you and others like you who make labours of love like this possible. I consider myself a huge Homeworld fan that is lucky enough to be in a position to shape and deliver an experience literally by the fans for the fans.  The Expedition Guide is something extra for those who crave more who love the lore and backstory who fondly remember the Technical Briefings of the originals. It adds impact weight and depth to the story ingame and makes it just that much more memorable. So sincerely it really does mean quite a bit to hear you enjoyed whats there.  As for Tiirs location its in the north though an exact longitude and latitude is never specified. Rest assured that the desert hasnt encroached on its location  yet.,homeworld,cz6si9l,5,t5_2re2q

6323429,0,t1_cz8aks8,Yeah the manual suggests that the division into Kiithid began when KharToba fell as it lost its powerplant which suggests that they were a literate industrialish society for all the time they were still there. Kiithid formed as family groups which Kushan sociologists suggest as the natural organisational unit in such circumstances dribbled away northwards. Population propagation and language separation must therefore have begun at that point because the population was beforehand too tightlyknit and cohesive to fragment,homeworld,cz8el3r,2,t5_2re2q
6340074,0,t3_42fw2j,I did exactly the same thing in that mission.,homeworld,czaanzb,1,t5_2re2q
6341767,0,t3_42hqyb,I would want better blanace. It was way to easy to just spam  unit in MP matches and win. MB Hives Fighters with missles. There was very little incentive to invest in a diversified fleet.,homeworld,czahlcj,1,t5_2re2q
6342080,0,t3_42enck,Completely agree with you. And I also like your coop idea. It all depends of the flexibility and the difficulty of scripting a mission. The most frustrating thing about the original HW games is that all missions are pretty hardcoded and making one for scratch with modding tools is iirc impossible.With the last patch of HWRM that added the Raider Retreat mission the possibility to add extra missions through Steam Workshop is added. I didnt check if someone had already uploaded something though.That idea implemented in DoK would be fantastic.,homeworld,czaivkm,2,t5_2re2q
6370228,0,t1_czcyuh7,Im sure once theyve had more than a week to look into these issues theyll start fixing them.,homeworld,czdq3t5,2,t5_2re2q
6374689,0,t3_42y81e,Would add to the game if it was the Gaalsiens goto capture unit much like the Marine and Infiltrator Frigates from HW.Imagine the BR being an oversized APC housing infantry squads exclusively used to capture EMPed enemy units within close proximity of the BR gameplaywise like the repairbeam from the coalition Support Cruiser.,homeworld,cze8dfi,4,t5_2re2q
6418940,0,t3_43lkqi,I personally find it a lot more fun to play than vanilla. Battlecruisers and Destroyers dont dominate the entire battlefield like they used to Frigates are actually useful Pulsar Gunships dont counter almost everything Defender clouds arent absurdly good etc.More generally bigger ships seemed to be almost always better in the vanilla version. The balance mod gives at least some usefulness back to smaller ship types.,homeworld,czj96oj,4,t5_2re2q
6419634,0,t1_czj96oj,Hiigaran fighter spam is insane in vanilla and gunships and pulsars make it even worse so its definitely good that they nerfed those.,homeworld,czjbros,1,t5_2re2q
6426146,0,t3_43psv7,This patch is a strong step forward.  A new map to keep multiplayer interesting a couple of Coalition nerfs to curb their power and some Gaalsien buffs.  All is good and well but the Gaalsien still have issues with the lategame given the lack of specialized showstoppers to pair off against Coalition lategame generalized showstoppers.,homeworld,czk01fh,3,t5_2re2q
6430999,0,t1_czkh2u8,...well for that you need to convince people in your area to start playing Homeworld. ,homeworld,czki54u,0,t5_2re2q
6476243,0,t3_44bobc,Dont need a justification in lore if you make it skirmish only. Same with maps gimme grassy plains urban areas snow maps etc! They can also make whatif scenarios too I guess.,homeworld,czp6v2a,8,t5_2re2q

6536825,0,t1_czvfzo2,Google is your friend in this matter.Mesopotamia and Indus valley civs are well documented IIRC Indus came first but Mesopotamia is where most of the action was  the twin rivers there where erratic in their flooding so the harvest was unreliable leading to conflict and nothing breeds technological advancement like war.China being the first to develop fermentation was new to me its quite likely weve been doing it long before then but we havent found anything that predates them yet.Out of Africa is considered common knowledge these days.,homeworld,czvgl0r,2,t5_2re2q
6585894,0,t1_czynqts,There is  stances in hw and there is  formations shown in the gif so yeah cant do that in vanilla! It is actual formation change and not just stance swapping. Oh yeah and lets not forget everything that were shown and said already...,homeworld,d00ja32,0,t5_2re2q
6679618,0,t1_d0a73w9,according to nobody.  Beghins was a big part of the Remastered team as was Oni and theyre very capable passionate developers.  Making it clear that the Complex team doesnt determinesetknow the release date for our patch is one thing.  Pointing out that Complex as well as plenty of other Mod groups are going to hit a wall with RAM limits is one thing.  But I dont think their work or effort is a sham period.,homeworld,d0a8c4v,14,t5_2re2q

6869014,0,t1_d0uezu0,gtI dont even know what he means by saying that Squadron size will be minimumHes talking about what happens when you break up a formation. They wont break up into single units but return to the squadrons they were in when first built.gtAnd while its true that BitVenom says that If you dont use the new stuff it isnt a factor that doesnt mean that HW races dont have squadrons.Having HW units build into squadrons rather than individual units would be a pretty big change and one the developers havent mentioned anywhere as being likely let alone definitive. Its true they havent explicitly denied it either but it would have been weird for them to do so as it was never seriously discussed in the first place. Theres really no good reason to think such a change will happen.,homeworld,d0uwwjf,1,t5_2re2q
6885631,0,t3_49z6m8,Umh someone posted here the DoK soundtrack that song is included there. I heard it multiple times. Let me search for it.EDIT Found it.

7872139,0,t1_d3zfjqi,Missile Destroyer is the only units im a bit in two minds about. I thought it was much more badass then the conventional destroyed and loved its long range bombardements.Otherwise it is better to have a distinct role for a unit like this. Seems like the patch creates more room for fighters and bombers again so there might be a more interesting place for good old missile destroyers.,homeworld,d40wfqo,1,t5_2re2q
7875533,0,t3_4n336g,I dont see any games on multiplayer I bought the game from GOG.,homeworld,d41a6hh,1,t5_2re2q
7881665,0,t3_4n8k48,Agreed. Especially with the autocollecting part. There should be an enabledisable option for that when starting a new campaign. Im sure its not that hard to implement. Dynamic scaling is also a lot worse than in original HW especially when it comes to those pods in rd mission and the enemy fleet size in final mission. I hoped that they would fix these issues in this big patch but for some reason they did not bother. I only tried first mission but Im very pleased with how formations work now. It even looks a bit better than in original HW.,homeworld,d41z0vj,2,t5_2re2q
7903731,0,t1_d449cp3,Thats odd. It couldve been trying to get into formation.,homeworld,d44gduo,2,t5_2re2q

8501694,0,t3_4w3px3,The one thing that I want above all else is another campaign. There are so many elements of the story in DoK that are just screaming for more development. Not only from the game itself but from the supplementary material as well. For example most of the wrecks we encounter throughout the game seems to have a similar design colors and markings. This leads me to believe that the majority of these ships belong to a race we dont yet know and I suspect that the Khaaneph are actually descendants of the survivors of some of these ships. That alone is worth an entire game. Then we also have the events bridging DoK and HW. The southern Kiith such as Manaan and Paktu and how they get involved. Repercussions from the Sidiim betrayals and what the Gaalsien are up to. Not to mention some fishy stuff that went on in the crew of the IfriitNabaal.,homeworld,d649jjm,11,t5_2re2q

10453719,0,t1_dcszx06,Thanks. Ill give it a watch. Usually my issues start on the third or fourth attack wave. I can destroy all the units they send at me but for whatever reason they keep producing units faster than i can. So their attack waves start piling up as Im trying to get rid of them and eventually my resource ops take a hit and my production crashes.,homeworld,dct15tm,1,t5_2re2q
11261357,0,t1_df8e7hb,Yeah I read that on the wiki.  Hiigaras only moon Angel Moon is where the preExile Hiigarans purposely crashed their flagship containing the second core.  It was supposed to be a symbolic FU to the Galactic Council and Taiidan for punishing them with exile.  Supposedly that core was then smuggled onto their ships before leaving for Kharak.That Tanis Derelict is supposed to be the remains of the Progenitor mothership and where the ancient Hiigarans found the second core.  It was their misuse of it that let the Council to banish them in the first place.Im reading this all from the wiki and this is mostly HW lore we are talking about here.  Wikis can and are regularly edited by administrators for various reasons so I would take all that with a grain of salt.  The quality source material has to come from the game itself along with any original manuals and such.  You can download the HW manual easy it actually explains a lot of this and not all of it jives perfectly with HW.Im also new to the party here.  But if I had to choose between believing HW or HW I would always choose HW without fail.  For the simple reason that its story can exist on its own.  HW needs HW to make any sense.  When two related storylines are in conflict in a specific way the original creative narrativeit terms of its truth always trumps anything added later.Thats just my opinion though.  ,homeworld,df8gi5i,1,t5_2re2q
11319950,0,t3_5ysg8p,A while back I located two older tools for this purpose. Ive uploaded two backups for your convenience so you dont have to scour the webThe first link is PeneSound which can extract music voice clips and sound effects in their raw formats works with both HW and HWC.The second link is a plugin for Winamp which allows you to play the raw formats themselves in Winamp. From there you can use Winamps Nullsoft Disk Writer Output option to create WAV files out of the raw audio.Hope this helps.,homeworld,dff3iig,2,t5_2re2q
