1806443,0,t3_2f70gx,Oh man. Mind if I tell the story of the last time I was in the psych ward? ...Too late doing it. Below material is less funny than serious so beware. So after I finished being asked all my basic questions on the ambulance ride I was kind of like no. Im done. Im done talking and I just couldnt words for an hour or two not even and finally felt safe enough to talk with my best friend there. I kept saying among other things I am not a fully functional human being. I had no idea what my future would hold  would I even be able to go to college? Spoiler alert Im sitting in my dorm room right now and my BFF is my roommate. That night I was really angry  I was convinced that they were trying to make me feel better when all I wanted was to go home so I could kill myself. And that the only way to feel better was believing a bunch of lies. So I ended up trying to help the other patients by going over to this one section where they had coloring books and pages and crayons and crossing out all the pictures with a big X. I wrote a few things along the line of the only coping skill is denial but I ended up taking those pages ripping them to pieces and stuffing them behind the table. I felt guilty about hurting them since maybe denial actually worked for them. But I knew I was destined to be dead. I should have been dead then. I deserved to be. I also tried to hurt myself with a tissue box. They took it away.I wrote on a piece of paper something along the lines of Do not listen to them they are lying to you you just have to keep yourself down because if you start to believe them youll just be miserable again anyway just keep yourself down til they release you they have to give up eventually and then you can kill yourself thats the only real way to avoid pain and you cant even function. That was the plan. The next day I just didnt get out of bed. I would just nap. I was just trying to pass the time until they gave up on me. They called me up. I ignored it. The doctor came in and I didnt respond. I was there. I had to make an effort not to respond sometimes. But I wasnt doing anything. I refused my meds and did not talk to anyone. Later I learned they thought I was catatonic. That night I got up and asked a male nurse what would happen if I didnt get better and he didnt really answer my question  insisted Id get better though I was actively refusing to get better. They wouldnt let me return to my room so I just stood a few feet away from the nurses station ripping up pieces of my scrubs and scratching myself when they werent looking. I decided to go back because they probably wouldnt even notice  they did. They followed me and when I refused to move or respond I ended up being escorted by like three or four people to the quiet room. Padded walls bed nailed to the floor. I hung out there for awhile terrified of myself but they left the door ajar so I ended up leaving to go back to the dayroom area and calling the suicide hotline from the psych ward of all things. I would have called a friend but I intentionally didnt check my phone for the numbers as a form of selfsabotage. After talking to them I felt better. I just didnt trust the staff for some reason. I really didnt talk to them much just the other patients who would listen to me talk about how I would never get better and give me hope rather than just saying Nope. Youre wrong. So then I ended up talking to the nurse again and calling my parents. I still had to sleep in the quiet room that night though I found out later that was just a staff error. Basically I was rather delusional. This seems to be a standard for my worst lows though  that I get really dangerously low. Later that week another patient said that when I first came in I was really bad talking to myself and stuff. I dont even remember talking to myself. Its possible I did. It makes me wonder exactly how detached from reality I was. Kind of scares me. ,mixednuts,ck6uhnl,14,t5_2wmtb
