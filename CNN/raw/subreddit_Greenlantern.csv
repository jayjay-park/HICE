226853,0,t3_1wpmwk,My lord they made The GL look like a chump in this movie.  batman was this stoic badass wonderwoman was like a baby hulk in a play shop even frigging flash did some copious amounts of work on darkseid.  But GL?  He gets tossed around by supes outsmarted by bats broken by darkseid I mean even when they gave him his moment in the spotlight they turn him into this bumbling failed leader.  This movie was awesome but It hurt my Greenlantern pride ,Greenlantern,cf49e66,13,t5_2rmm3

1919488,0,t1_ckkcet3,To say that the few books venditti did are just as good as the expansive epic run that johns created a run that redefined the lantern universe really doesnt do the work justice. Sure Venditti has been ok on the run but I think its unfair to give it the same weight and quality as the Johns work.,Greenlantern,ckkhhd9,1,t5_2rmm3

3972576,0,t1_cr0zngo,some spoilers from red lanterns if you havent read that a few months ago It was sprinkled with awesome or awful. Like I loved Bleezs remark about the purpose of red lanterns or the oh shit feeling when Atrocitous sent down all the rings. But breaking lore and allowing Guy to absorb the anger? It was total bullshit. Sticking with lore only a blue could cure a red lantern. If they had ended with Guy going blue like in futures end I would have loved it.,Greenlantern,cr93uu1,1,t5_2rmm3

5657568,0,t1_cwy7mi2,So when DC launched The new  they started numbering all of their titles including Green Lantern and all of the other series related to it. So after War of the Green Lanterns Aftermath the four series Green Lantern Green Lantern Corps Green Lantern New Guardians and Red Lanterns will all be numbered volumes. You can proceed through them by reading the first volume in all of them then the second in all of them so on and so on. All four of those series went up to volume  I believe with all of them except the main Green Lantern title being cancelled after the sixth volume. There are tons of crossover events in the Green lantern world so you might see books called Rise of the Third Army Wrath of the First Lantern or Lights out. These are basically just collections of all of the series issues pertaining to an event for example Wrath of the First Lantern contains I think issues  of all four series. You can usually pass on the collected volumes if youre getting all of the individual trades because its the same issues. Once you catch up on all of that youre basically caught up with what is out right now. Fair warning the main Green Lantern story is AMAZING through the new  volume  Titled The End and the Green Lantern Corps storyline is pretty good itself and a great companion New  volume  as well. New Guardians is kind of ehhhh and the first three volumes of Red Lanterns are considered by most to not be that good. However Red Lanterns is very good once Charles Soule takes over as the author Volume . I stopped reading after volume  in all of the series except red lantern so I cant attest to the quality of the main two series GL and GLC afterwards but I dont hear positive things. Take that for what you will. ,Greenlantern,cwydk7e,2,t5_2rmm3

11518696,0,t3_64ckwx,If you look at Supermans suit. You can see its made of little S symbols. I dont want that for the gl suit. It should me smooth. With some white gloves and boots maybe.The Suits isnt like Batmans or Superman suit. Its made of Will power not actual fabric. So it should glow. Also i want some different looking suits for all characters. I remember reading that every gl suit is designed by the wielder. Thats why Guys suit looks different then Johns for example.,Greenlantern,dg1n9ak,3,t5_2rmm3
