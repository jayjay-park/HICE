5127531,0,t1_cv3v5xh,There is really no way to be sure without seeing it working in person. With expensive strips like that youre definitely paying for more consistency and more accurate tech specs and even sometimes a better warranty.I wouldnt go with a strip thats  for ft. Although its probably  for m which is . feet which is a little better but not by much. Most strips come as m.Some strips on amazon arent too bad you just have to be careful and also lucky. It might not be a bad idea to buy a sample first before buying a lot of one strip. It all depends on the project how much youre will to spend and how much quality youre looking for out of the leds. Often times the strips on amazon have a very low number of leds per every foot of strip. That lets the price be low because there arent so many leds but then brightness greatly suffers.In terms of tech specs to look at life expectancy is usually important in telling the quality of the led at least as far as Ive found. The average seems to be about  hours more usually means higher quality and lower usually means worse quality. Then of corse there is color temperature which can be hard to match. But leds that are within a few hundreds of K look pretty similar. For instance a K and a K are pretty much indistinguible from each other. ,led,cv425sn,1,t5_2rgyj

10418478,0,t3_5kvhvf,I maintain the LEDscape  project which can easily drive k WSBs or APAs from a Beagle Bone Black. Youll need to either build or buy a board to do the .v gt v level shifting for up to  channels or use .v tolerant WSBs.,led,dcp03xw,2,t5_2rgyj
10488638,0,t3_5q77yt,Are you controlling the LEDs somehow to change color? I assume these connectors are clip on not soldered? What is the voltage coming out of the power supply?Your body may be providing some capacitance when you touch the strip alleviating some problems. Usually flickering occurs if there are issues with the controller.,led,dcwzwfz,1,t5_2rgyj
