7760091,0,t1_d3o6400,I got the mm f the mm f. and the mm f..  I love them all. The  and  are weather resistant which is great with my XT and with the mm its a joy to carry all day on just a wrist strap. I want to like the others more but I just love carrying it with the mm too much.,fujifilm,d3o9gjd,2,t5_2yahd

9588198,0,t1_d9tqmcr,One thing Id like to mention is that if you do go the zoom route its important to learn the role of focal length. Zooming does not replace moving. Sometimes you will want to shoot on the wide end of the zoom but really close in order to get a dramatic effect. Other times you will want to back up and zoom in in order to compress the background while maintaining a certain framing.Here is an example of how focal length changes an image notice the block stays the same size in the frame but everything else moves. Its a common misconception that lenses direct this compression really it is where you put your feet when you take the photoa different lens will just influence that.A zoom is a good tool to learn this important principle.,fujifilm,d9uxw6r,5,t5_2yahd

10608379,0,t1_dda5vld,Yeah thats fair! Id like the mm f and the  but I think Ill only be able to afford the one initially. I suppose the Zoom would be more versatile but I love the simplicity of a Prime lens. Feel free to post some links to your stuff!,fujifilm,dda68jw,1,t5_2yahd
10898311,0,t1_de408ed,AF could be better. Thats definitely something that DSLRs have over most mirrorless systems. While its not as bad as that of my previous Canon D it does hunt a bit in lower light situations as well as when tracking moving objects. However this is using the Fuji  zoom. Primes do seem to perform better.,fujifilm,de430ji,1,t5_2yahd
10969162,0,t3_5vu6sd,The mmf. is a heavy bulky piece of glass. Keep that in mind.,fujifilm,debe3ty,1,t5_2yahd

11385767,0,t3_62ggg9,I have not even held the mm but everyone says it is amazing. Get it.The XFmm is one of my favourite lenses it is wonderful! Most of my photos are from this. And I shoot street photography primarily!I own the mm also and... I... well I dont hate it. I just... fuck no I kinda hate it. If it is raining or I have to go somewhere with but a single lens... then I guess I like it.I cant look at a photo taken by it and not know that I used this superzoom for it.Ahhg. The only lens that I regret purchasing.I shouldnt shit on it so much. Too snobby with my XFmm. XF magic.edit I should note I look at everything  and blah why didnt I buy the mm as my WR lens... WHY?!edit This post is rude I realize. Im just really salty between choosing the  WR over the mm F. WR. One is a Swiss army knife and the other is... some sort of... magical sword of magic.,fujifilm,dfmk2pk,5,t5_2yahd
11468832,0,t1_dfvywg0,Thank you very much.  Youre validating my choice.  I decided to go with the f because when it comes down to it I bought the camera for travel photography.  Where I got myself started down the wrong path is the fact that I got the mm f. the day I bought the body.  Its such a beautiful lens and is taking incredible pictures of my family.  The huge aperture mixes very well with the XT and made me want that level lens for all my primes.  I think the f will be the correct choice.  If I start to desire more I think Ill get the mm f..,fujifilm,dfvzigz,1,t5_2yahd
11557161,0,t1_dg576a4,What adapter specifically are you using to mount your FD on your Fuji?  ,fujifilm,dg60b0w,2,t5_2yahd

11764798,0,t3_67ubld,Honestly I had the  for a while but saw a great deal of the  and I liked the smaller form factor so I sold the . I find the  much sharper up close. Love the rendering of this lens.,fujifilm,dgtkio8,2,t5_2yahd
11770937,0,t1_dgtnuau,. doesnt bother me either. What makes me think about getting the  is the wider angle and possibly better quality images,fujifilm,dgu9mj7,1,t5_2yahd
