4030142,0,t1_crfipn7,With regards to the Paleo part A lot of NF rebels have reported great success with prepreparing meals on the weekend to see them through the week. Having meals lined up in advance can make all the difference. Combining this with clearing out the junk food from the cupboard also heals a lot. The secret is to plan and organise as much as you can when youre feeling up and keen to get fit so that when youre down and want to sloth in front of the TV youre more likely to make good decisions.As for the home training Id start with putting aside an area to exercise in and getting some yoga mats to have a nice surface to exercise on. You can do a lot with bodyweight exercises but you may want to consider getting a kettlebell to take it to the next level.,nerdfitness,crfo0s4,1,t5_2udk1
