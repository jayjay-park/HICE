If it is countered I like to use WR screen because if it is countered you can tell by the zone coverage formation the defense does you can run straight up the middle with the QB and gain like  yards. A lot of people also use TE Corner because even if its countered you still have enough time to get a pass out and the TE usually catches it.

3122754,0,t3_2vti13,Stats guy here. I would suggest not spending any actual money on the Gauntlet set and you should probably save your stamina too although thats less important and heres why You need to get  collectibles to clear the set. Based on how the NFL Domination set all the collectibles are equally likely and the game ostensibly doesnt cheat in either direction making specific collectibles more or less likely to annoybenefit you. So the expected value of collectibles you would need before you get one of each type is ! And thats not a typo. With Domination it wasnt a big deal. You could do it many times a day. If you rattle off  collectibles a day for  a week youll finish it in . weeks on average. I got Sherman even a little faster than that without spending a dime although I did get a little lucky at the end there. With Gauntlet if youre limited to one or two tries a week youre going to be stuck doing it until the  football season starts unless you get tremendously lucky and even then like you said itll take at least another  weeks. Youve actually touched on the problem elsewhere. Madden is missing out on a bit of revenue here and they would be well served to just mimic what they did with Domination high stamina requirement one collectible many tries pretty damn difficult to incentivize players to try harder to get Chancellor quickly. EA gains nothing by preventing even the best players from getting Chancellor for another few months best case scenario is April realistic September bad luck DecemberJanuary. Thats just not a good way to build interest in the game. ,MaddenMobileForums,colo7q3,1,t5_34m8j

I got a out  in K range. right now there are over  elite safeties just sitting there buy now for K. Its pretty easy to snipe safeties because there are so many. Pro tip start the min buy now price around KK and the max buy now to Let the crazies fight over the super cheap ones. If you grab  snipes at K thats K. Get the mid tier snipe first before the kids that grab the K snipe are looking. If you get more than  theyll sell now for atleast K almost immediately. ,MaddenMobileForums,cotevd0,2,t5_34m8j

3577060,0,t3_31b926,I wouldnt swap Vjax for Legend Larry Fitzgerald. I havent heard of anyone saying Larrys that great of a card. And with VJax you have an ultimate matchup against speedy CBs the strength and slow speed to get behind the corner and catch the ball without dropping it. If you were going to replace Vincent Jackson with any other physical WR then it would have to be MM Calvin Johnson IMO. Team MVP Delanie Walker is the best blocking TE in the game. TOTY Greg Olsen is a top  receiving TE in the game. I wouldnt necessarily sell Walker as Im not sure how many coins it would give you because he could be used as a TE for his blocking ability and his receiving stats arent terrible. But you certainly should take him out of the slot. I would put in a receiver like GC Patterson  AWR  STR or GC Cecil Shorts III  ACC  STR. Either one of these receivers will significantly boost your team. You should eventually upgrade PH Bell to Bo Jackson as he is the best HB in the game. But for now you are fine as Bell is quite suitable. PH Miller is great at FB and MM Vick is great at QB.Your Oline obviously needs help but that may take time depending on how many coins you have. MM Webster and Dierdorf are players you should target no matter what. They are the most affordable MM Olinemen. MM Larry Allen and Upshaw are too expensive right now so I would hold off on upgrading at guard until you can afford either one of them. Since there is no new MM OT yet PH Joe Thomas is the nd best OT in the game. No matter who you choose to buy first for OT you should replace RTTP Team MVP Will Beatty first. RTTP Team MVP Anthony Davis is still a really good card and has  RBK. He should be the last OT you upgrade.If you are less concerned about OVR then MM Smith and Reggie White are not crucial. Instead you should get Honors JJ Watt and place him in over Combine Clowney. You will want to replace Donald and Poe with MM Greene and PH McCoy. Until then put Poe in the starting DT position over Donald.Replace FO LaVonte David with PH Jamie Collins. Hes the most affordable  LB. Personally I like RTTP Levy more than I do FO David. I would leave Levy in the  LB position but it doesnt matter which LB you choose to have there. At MLB you should play either PH DeMario Davis or Frozen Lambert. Lamberts stats may not be aweinspiring but his  PLR is the best of any defensive player in the game. PH Davis is like MM Pat Willislite. Willis is still too expensive so one of the other  OVR MLBs will have to do.IMO your defensive backfield is solid. I would save up your coins to purchase more top tier defensive backs in the future. Your targets will be MM Deion Sanders and Legend NTL. Youll eventually want to upgrade to Harrison Smith at safety but Ive found that a boosted RTTP ET can be just as effective hes got so many picks in HH. From there you would determine whether you want ET or Patrick Peterson in your dime once you have all the other great DBs. But for now leave your offensive and defensive backfield are the strongest parts of your team.This is my advice for now. A lot of this depends on how many coins you have. PM me with any more questions on Madden Mobile or if you need coin making tips.,MaddenMobileForums,cq00gyd,2,t5_34m8j

You could try using much lower ranked Oline low ranked Fullback low ranked Slot WR and then leave Defense at like  OVR. Problem is that Im pretty sure that scaling is increased based on season number as in season  has more scaling by default vs season  and possibly based on your OVR as well. Ive found that players with greater than  height are more difficult for the CPU to defend. Also have found that at times there are games where you literally cannot throw the ball at all so maybe have  great TE and the rest of your players be setup for Run  Run block. Other than that season mode gets pretty laughable some games haha ,MaddenMobileForums,cq518of,1,t5_34m8j

3736351,0,t3_336ehl,I prefer GC Cecil Shorts III  ACC  KIP especially if you play a lot of HH. Its worth it for the boost to your pass rush alone but its also very useful for defensive backs and receivers too. You wont feel the  KIP with Shorts but GC Cordarelle Patterson  AWR  STR needs to be paired with someone who gives at least  STR  preferably  STR since I would recommend GC Jon Ryan  AWR  STR no matter who you use or which modes you play.,MaddenMobileForums,cqi62zv,1,t5_34m8j

4618552,0,t3_3e98yy,Here are my recommendations at each positionOFFENSEQB MM Tom Brady From personal experience MM Vick is probably my favorite QB in the game. Hes far from a perfect passer but his combination of speed and deep ball accuracypower are what make him effective. Unfortunately he is really far down the ladder of QBs that are best for OVR. MM Brady is at the top of that ladder. Your Oline looks like its good enough to protect Brady so I recommend getting him at some point. He struggles to sell at  million coins so during legend packs you should be able to find him for less than a million.HB Legend Bo Jackson Best HB in the game. Enough said. Legend Bo is really rd on the list of best HBs for team OVR but he operates like the best in the game. His general stats are all in the s. He is well worth the purchase. He sits around . or . million during Legend Packs but every now and then youll see one for . or . million coins.WR FE Antonio Brown Right now Brown is not that affordable. The only cards of his I saw were at . million coins at the least. When he drops below that price hes worth picking up. Brown is the th best receiver for team OVR. According to my brother hes an insane player and well worth picking up.TE MM Gronk Gronk is the best TE in the game. He runs as low as . mil during Legend Packs maybe lower. If you purchased him ideally youd move Graham to the slot and sell Cooks. Apparently TEs contribute more to OVR in the slot than receivers. After getting Gronk you could even try selling Graham too and purchasing Ditka. Hes better for OVR than Graham.OT MM Dan Dierdorf Like Webster Dierdorf has seen some fluctuating prices lately. He can go as low as . or . mil sometimes. Hed replace PH Wagner.OG MM Gene Upshaw Of all my offensive recommendations Upshaw might be the most unrealistic. He can run as low as  million coins but doesnt do so often. Id recommend Sitton too but Sitton costs a lot for only being the th best OG in the game. If you have to settle for Sitton over Upshaw its not the end of the world. But after awhile Robinson will start to hold your offense back.C MM Mike Webster Of course Im going to recommend the best center in the game. Hes probably the most expensive of my offensive recommendations. The lowest Ive seen him reach lately is  million coins. He might drop in prices eventually but even if he doesnt youre fine with PH Kelce.DEFENSEDE MM Bruce Smith MM Julius Peppers? Bruce Smith is better for OVR than Honors Watt. Watt generally plays better than Smith in the game but Smith is the th best DE for team OVR. JPP is rd for OVR at DE so thats a good pairing. Smith costs less than Watt too so youd actually be making a profit while slightly improving team OVR. I also recommend considering MM Julius Peppers. Hes the nd best DE in the game and he costs as low as . mil during Legend Packs. He might not improve your defensive OVR right away but he is better for it. Not necessary but something to consider.DT I have no recommendation here.LB MM Derrick BrooksMM James Harrison MM Lawrence Taylor? This is a BIG if. Brooks can cost as low as . or . million but he generally hangs around . or . million. If you can afford him you will be getting the nd best LB in the game. Another REALLY BIG if is MM Lawrence Taylor. He generally costs around . million coins during Legend Packs but he can cost as low as . or . million. If you get him you will have the  LB in the game and one of the better contributors to OVR. A far more affordable option over either Brooks or LT is MM James Harrison. He will go as low as k coins during Legend Packs. Its more realistic and affordable to target Brooks and Harrison  amp  respectively at LB.MLB MM Jack Lambert andor MM Ray Lewis For this position I put an andor sign. Why? Cause if you can make a lot of coins these two are very affordable players. You already have DeMario Davis which means you only need to go for one ILB. But if you want both you can get both. Lewis will hang around  or . million coins during Legend Packs sometimes lower. Lambert struggles to even sell at  million coins!! I bought his rookie MM card for  million coins uncontested. It had been sitting in the AH for awhile. So there are options to consider at ILB.CB Legend NTL? Tbh I am extremely impressed with your secondary. You barely need to change this part of your team. In fact you could ignore secondary upgrades and still be fine with that as your legacy lineup. My only recommendation is to keep your eyes on MM NTL prices. If you can get him it could be well worth the purchase. He would slot in as the  CB while Vontae would move to the  spot. You would then sell Patrick Peterson. This is not necessary but its an option to consider.S MM Ronnie Lott Like I said before you dont need to do anything to your secondary. If you do want to tweak here and there I would recommend replacing PH Harrison Smith with MM Ronnie Lott. Lott is extremely affordable. If you sold PH Harrison and raised k more coins you could get Lott and put him in your dime spot. Hes better for OVR than Harrison Smith. Easter Rod Woodson is also worth considering but he costs about . million coins during legend packs.These are my recommendations for who you should consider at each position. You might not be able to get everyone on this list but you should at least consider everyone on this list. Keep note of these names and check their prices as you make more coins. When you see one thats reasonable and will significantly increase your team OVR then go for it. I have no recommendation as to which position you should target first. Your team is very good and doesnt need too many upgrades. Players you should obviously keep regardless of roster shifts PH Joe Thomas PH Kyle Long Domination Sherman no brainer PH Vontae Davis MM Ed Reed Gauntlet Kam ChancellorNo matter who you get always keep these players. If you got someone like MM Bo in a pack then you might want to consider selling Kam. But thats a what if scenario. Players you should keep but would sell if you got someone better include PH Bruce Miller PH Dez Bryant PH JPP PH Gerald McCoy PH Mean Joe Greene PH Patrick Peterson and PH Jamie Collins.Good luck with upgrading your team before the reset!,MaddenMobileForums,ctcqvbi,8,t5_34m8j

4717325,0,t1_ctoezc8,You need to upgrade DT soon. Id say  Dareus is a budget not really option.  I like him but that may be my Bills bias.  Other than him obviously MJG is the guy to get.  Hes about k i think so hes in range for sure. I love your secondary and I cant really think of an upgrade thats worth it only a few days before the reset. Special teams could be upgraded. If you can get Jano or Hekker. Getting both doesnt really make sense considering they arent actual impact players but since your special teams is so low its holding you back overall wise. Id drop the big bucks on  Jano then get a  punter.  That combined will run you about k which isnt too much considering it will raise your overall by at least  points according to my rough calculation.  Your Oline could be upgraded so I would put that collectable to use and spend the k needed to make the rest of the PH set.  That leaves you k maybe if youre lucky. If you can make an extra k on top of that which you likely will just by selling Frederick then you got k to upgrade your OG.   Legend Larry Allen should definitely be on your radar. Not sure if youll be able to afford him but with a bit of grinding you could definitely pull it off.  Hes great with  RBKPBK and hes a Cowboy. Not quite as good as the  MM Allen but hes much cheaper.  Hope it helps!  and nice team by the way!Edit just checked the AH and legend Allen is running about mil.  like wtf?  ok then sorry. dont think you can afford him unless people get their marbles back.,MaddenMobileForums,ctp5o8o,1,t5_34m8j

Even if it gets to forth down. On average i gain about  yards a play.  Most people dont check film  so they wont see you running it the whole time. And even if it does get countered try it one more time. two counters in a roll show you he has it down. In that case run the other FB play. The other is better but youll have to scroll down to find it. And that waste valuable time. im only  overal and im in All Pro II,MaddenMobileForums,cuf3y1a,1,t5_34m8j

5240797,0,t1_cvhp67e,What people like you dont realize because you probably lack experience from last year is that EA is extremely inept at what they do and that the economy always recovers from mass influxes of coins. EA has never before reset coins. Im surprised they even had the capability. There is absolutely no way that they have the capability to reset the whole game to a certain point in time. You really think that the people who can barely run enough servers to support normal gameplay are making backups of every single player in the game and keeping track of every player that someone owns and the sets theyve completed? There was a coin glitch last season and EA did nothing about it. People were also crying at that time that the economy was ruined. It took  months to recover but it was perfectly back to normal. Last year I was one of the ones who werent able to take advantage of the glitch but I was more than able to take advantage of the situation and by the end of the season I had a  OVR team. ,MaddenMobileForums,cvhpfbn,-1,t5_34m8j

Meaning playing the same event over and over again also do not forget to play every live event available every day. Great way to earn some coins and to get some XP.If you need any advice or help feel free to PM me. D,MaddenMobileForums,cwrji9q,2,t5_34m8j

But in response to OP tips I have received are to score quick always use onside kick and eventually youll get better and have a chance of gaining possession... and towards the end of the nd Q or game it may be smart to let the other team score on purpose IOT allow you time to get in another quick score.

6070120,0,t3_3yonsa,Smash smash smashGet a mobile QB and a fast catching RB. I use McNabb and TOTW David JohnsonTwo options. Run smash roll out to the right if the HB is open do a halfbullet pass to him for  yards. If its man defense just throw it out of bounds and try next time.. Flip it. Throw to your receiver running the curl route if hes open and if hes not open  times your HB is. This is more time consuming but less risky.Also to play worse people put in a bronze dline bronze nickel and dime gold FB and TE and a bronze WR. This will put you against people  OVRs less than you. Once you have played enough people or youre going to bed put in your good defense again. I gain more fans from Deion or Sean Taylor shutting down  OVR kids than I do from scoring.I made m fans doing this for the past  days.Edit when you pass to your hb with smash usually there is a linebacker between you and your hb so pass it hard enough that he catches it before anyone gets to him but not too hard. If you do a straight bullet the linebacker will jump up and pick it off and if you do a lob a db will get there first and pick it off.,MaddenMobileForums,cyfa55l,3,t5_34m8j

6200928,0,t1_cyuc0lz,Of the teams available gb is the only one with thier current team that havent really shown consistent flashes of greatness.  Not the same GB offense ppl saw in week one and its shown too many times the second half of the season.  If the season started week  they would have a losing record....not a great trend.  Washington and the Texans didnt belong in the playoffs really and showed again why division winners can really hurt the playoff talent pool week .  Also rodgers is  is the playoffs I think..maybe  now.  Given that  is  years ago and that was a wildcard run that means the Packers have had a pretty bad record in the playoffs recently.  On the other hand everyone else in the playoffs still all have either had recent playoff success recent winstreaks andor a very good season.  Anything can happen though this is the nfl not the nba or the nhl...the better team loses much more often due to the one and done nature of the beast so GB has a punches chance at the very least and heck all it takes is a few discount double check games and thier weak defense can get bailed out.  I also tend to agree that some teams work better as the underdog.  The pack have shown in the last few playoffs they shrink a bit under the light of being a favorite so this might be a better position for them.  ,MaddenMobileForums,cyuh9d2,2,t5_34m8j

6431299,0,t3_43s5nd,Whitner gets a spot in my opinion. The AGI boost separates him from the other  safeties and his boosted stats are pretty solid for a SS.Aaron Rodgers could get a spot. He boosts a bit more than Brady and still offers a boost of his own which is marginally useful if youre starting guys like Watkins Mack or Lott.Law might also get a spot if you want to start a CB at nickel or dime. Hes not better than Lane or Sanders and with Whitner as a new option at safety theres not much room for CBs outside of CB and CB. Not necessary for top teams but an option for them.No spot for Nicks. Beckham and Rice are obvious favorites and if you dont prefer Watkins speed boost I think Blitz Julio Jones is better anyways.,MaddenMobileForums,czkj9da,1,t5_34m8j

7014573,0,t1_d1853xv,It is odd that there are stops in film though that begs a question is it really because theyre cheating or is that just an assumption? ea gives the option to save and exit at anytime and in my league there is a rule if you get in a pickle stop and ask for help and that would explain a stop in progress for us. I really do hope EA has a way to track and have undeniable proof for banning only cheating leagues and not just assuming someone is cheating because they received a complaint. i would hate to see a legit league be banned just because they are organized and help each other out. Isnt that the concept of having a league in the first place?

I got all bronze players for  silvers for  and got all the trophies doing reverse Dieon by getting gold players for  and doing the trophy trade in and selling all gold and elite trophies and putting bronze and silvers in sets... The money for bronze players you get back from the  per completed set and i recovered almost all my silver players expense from profits of doing reverse Dieon. Essentially he cost me nothing expect for A LOT of time.. And at the End i sold him for . built Barry for k and sold for .m.

They may do something similar this year and roll out gameplay updates a mo th in advance e of the new game.  Of course we still have nothing to indicate they are even doing legacy or the same game. Again this year.  For all we know they are going to be doing a resetfull new game...so too much speculation I feel just sets you up for disappointment in this case though still build a legacy team...as chances are still kinda high for it to be done the same as last year.  ,MaddenMobileForums,d33qmdz,1,t5_34m8j
7595595,0,t3_4jcmtg,If none are up then sell for anywhere from k to k. If there are a few up then the prices will be closer to k or lower. It depends on the prevalence and availability of other high OVR guards. That Osemele card is one of the better OGs in the game. He can either be a nice addition to your team or a great player to make some coins off of. But this all depends on your AH. Im just going off of what I see in mine. What I see in my AH currently Saturday  at  pm PST   Osemele  k bid k BIN no bids   Osemele  k bid k BIN no bids   Osemele   base bid . mil BIN k bid   Osemele  k bid k BIN no bids So actually youd probably be best off trying to sell him for k BIN k bid. Put him up for  hours and if he doesnt sell slowly lower your BIN buy now price. I think youll find a buyer once your buy now price falls below k when you do that try a k BIN k bid. Anyways this is the best way I can think to help you. Congrats on the pull and hopefully you make a good amount of coins off the card!!! ,MaddenMobileForums,d35kx5q,2,t5_34m8j

Dont be salty and call me out  I was just giving my opinion on the matter.What I dont like about many YouTubers is that many of you are desperate for views and rehost web content in a video form. I guess you could say thats a positive because it brings information out to people who might not have seen it had it not been a video but this information hasnt even been confirmed. Id be fine if it was a reputable source  for example Dru or Alfonso or Fox. Pushing unconfirmed info out to the masses just leads to their disappointment.I also dont like YouTubers who spam their links on subreddits. Im fine if you post one video every week but there are certain people who post their garbage videos every day under titles like OMG INSANE ELITE PULL!! when they pulled a base Julius Thomas in a pro pack.I called you an idiot in one of my comments because of the EA Certified Coin BuyerSeller fiasco. Yeah Im over it but I was just pointing out your lessthanstellar conversation with me a while back.Im completely fine with you being in the subreddit and YouTubers in general. As long as they post insightful content dont spam places with their content and dont pass on unconfirmed information its fine with me.Sorry for the rant I tried my hardest to get my thoughts out in a coherent way.,MaddenMobileForums,d639gy5,3,t5_34m8j

8689334,0,t1_d6rhfw3,They still match your team overall. Im around k fans right now...they match you within   pts of your team overall. Im ovr so Im getting matched against  team overall players. So I try to only start matches against  overalls or less.All you need to do is get a good RB like Leveon Bell and a good TE and a decent QB. Run the ball every time and if you need to do a desperation pass to your TE. For example I have leveon bell travis kelce and AJ mcarron. I win  of my matchups. Get a good running game plan down where you rotate between  run plays. I know HB dive wk and either HB blast will get me a first down or close to one every time so Ill do other run plays inbetween those like the regular HB dive or hb toss. If im rd and long and I cant use HB dive wk or HB blast available bc i just used them Ill throw to the slot in bunch z spot or the TE in cross up and it usually works if the LB doesnt drop back.Also a HUGE part of it is to get a GOLD pt defense gameplan card. Get the pt PA Pass Run card or if you can find one just the run card. It will help you win matchups.,MaddenMobileForums,d6rsm0n,1,t5_34m8j

8723940,0,t3_4zidva,If youre in a good league with lots of members you should get Eifert in about    weeks. Then use him until you get MM Gronk. Same with Von Miller kind of a waste since you should get the Dom version probably within  months  wins per live event  times a week is  cards in  months  is the average needed.That leaves AB and Gurley. Im getting Gurley cus he has nice speed at  and not a bunch of nerfed stats in everything else like most  speed HBs. And there has been no indication of getting a  freebie HB at this point but we may get one later. I dont need good WRs since I mostly throw short passes since deep ones are very risky due to the DB speed boost.,MaddenMobileForums,d6w4twd,2,t5_34m8j
8724558,0,t1_d6vutts,Do you think he would stay on teams purely for the boost though? Certainly his overall is mediocre but his effect on the whole defense might be worth it especially since he can be jammed in a flex spot.

8770272,0,t3_505kst,Sorry if this has been asked already but I dont see it. Once out how does one get back into the pool? Does it happen when you initiate a HH match? If so anyone trying to build up fans at their own pace will be continually thrown back into the pool and either have to deal with the nuisance or constantly forfeit. If not then how do you get back?The new system of requiring people to forfeit seems very silly compared to the obvious simplicity of an opt inout button. The button would solve the problem above and eliminate the perverse incentive youve created for everyone who wants out of HH to forfeit at least once. To be honest the current system is so obviously inferior that I wonder whether you guys are intentionally making it unpleasant to opt out because youre worried about the size of the pool. Not that I expect you to admit that. And dont get me wrong this is a big improvement over what was there before and I am thankful.,MaddenMobileForums,d71y64l,3,t5_34m8j

9895933,0,t1_daxe39x,My suggestion is have a large medium speed guy if you are going to throw it deep. You only want to throw it deep if the coverage is over the top. Wait and see if the cb peels off the deep route leaving you alone with the safeties over top. Only then throw deep. If the cb sticks with the receiver either go with an outlet pass or scramble. It is very rare that your wr will ever outrun a defender so never throw a bomb if a defender is underneath!I personally use mf AB as my cb. Rarely use him except for crossing routes. I have gronk as my tight end and he is my number  receiver. There are so many good tight end routes and he can do it all. I have Decker in my slot. I like the awr boost with the combination of his great size str and trucking makes him great for dump offs quick outs and deep throws. I have Moore as my wr. He is a monster and can do it all but i tend to like using him for inside crossing routes. He has the speed strength trucking and cit to be very dynamic in traffic and after the catch. Try out a STR trucker for quick outs and see what you think. You can get a lot of yards without much risk. The agility trucks are just too slow and tend to get blown up more often I find.,MaddenMobileForums,daxgpgs,1,t5_34m8j

10614456,0,t1_dda21l6,Exactly!!  This is what Im doing as I made the same mistake I couldve easily done elway and Blount had I realized just how much introducing one elite player let active person player could kill the market so fast especially once I found out it was Blount I honestly totally misplayed that one but I times white like a dream had him built for .m and sold  extras for k profit per lol...guess its just all in the game right..... that said Blount is flush in circulation right now but based on his on field play theres plenty reason to believe he could be viable Thru the end of the season ppl will begin to slot him in their lineups permanently and Id bet within  hours Blount will be up to .m may take a little longer... but I firmly believe that SB elites will be rising tomorrow big time idk who the last or  hr players are but I wouldnt think theyd give us anything not specifically stronger than the ones so far...time will tell but keep Blount ,MaddenMobileForums,ddasuc8,1,t5_34m8j

Its almost certainly going to be Matt Ryan if the Falcons do win though theres basically no way the Falcons win without Ryan having a great game.If its the Patriots to your point I would anticipate LeGarrette Blount being heavily involved but I think itll be Tom Terrific for MVP.But to be fair Im also just hoping for a QB since Im using TOTW Brady at the moment sold Favre in anticipation of the MVP being a QB and the MVP badge on my bench would look pretty sweet as a  QB with AWR and somethingelse.

As for Eifert go for TOTY Julio or SB Rice. Both cards are phenomenal and arent too costly. If you really want you can sell Favre for Brady and sell Favre to work with more.
