11207781,0,t1_df2d053,Its impossible to build a phylogenetic tree of all living things from genetic data. ampnbspBREAKING EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST ADMITS TREE OF LIFE A MYTHampnbspOkay not really. What I mean is you cant use the same gene or region to compare everything simultaneously. Instead you have to use different genes and genomic regions to compare based on how similar or different things are. So when you have a tree like this thats showing the relationships among extremely diverse groups in this case the three domains you have to use an extremely highly conserved part of the genome. To make that tree the DNA that codes for the RNA of the small ribosomal subunit was used thats called rDNA. This sequence is extremely conserved across all forms of life so we can make informative comparisons between for example bacteria and algae. ampnbspBut if you want to compare mammals for example all of the rDNA is pretty close to identical so you cant make informative comparisons. So we use other regions of the genome to compare between more similar organisms. These regions are less well conserved meaning they change faster so there are more differences between say dolphins blue whales and hippos then in the rDNA of those same groups so you can get a higherresolution picture of the relationships. ampnbspSo why dont we use those regions for everything? Two reasons.First in different groups we use different genes and other groups may lack those genes. For example in plants we use a protein from the chloroplast that is involved with photosynthesis. We obviously cant use that protein in animals. Second there is the problem of saturation which means that mutations have accumulated to the point where if you have two bases that are the same the probability that this is due to convergence is equal to or greater than the probability that it is due to common ancestry. Which means that site is no longer informative. This is a problem when comparing very different organisms and when using sequences that accumulate mutations quickly. ampnbspWe can put multiple different trees together using different comparisons as you zoom in from broader to narrower groups. ampnbspTo your other question how would this tree compare to a purely morphological tree there would be differences but I cant say with certainty what most of them would be. One good example I do know of is a group called the acoela. Its a relatively small group of flatwormlike things that are members of the bilaterian clade in the animal kingdom theyre the little green worm things here but unlike every other member of that clade they do not have and never did have a body cavity. Morphologically they are extremely similar to the some members of Phylum Platyhelminthes and were for a long time part of that group. Once we sequenced some of their genes we realized theyre a separate group less related to the other members of bilateria than any of those other members are to each other. Youd find a lot of cases like this if you combed the tree carefully. ,Creation,df2e0n8,16,t5_2t3sv
11216662,0,t1_df2x5cs,Sticking with Behe for now the problem is that he does exactly what you say heregtOn the rest Behes paper isnt trying to model the entire evolutionary process just one specific type of mutation. Fair enough. But then as you saygthe argues that if takes this many microbes to stumble upon and fix evolutionary gains then a much smaller population of humans should not be able to evolve twostepwithoutintermediate gains at all.But thats exactly the problem Im articulating. Hes using a model that is oversimplified for prokaryotes and then drawing conclusions for humans which as sexual diploid organisms have even more complex mechanisms in play. Its completely unreasonable to draw the conclusions he does from that paper. It actually supports the exact opposite conclusion showing how quickly these kinds of processes can act in realworld populations. Well prokaryotic populations are bigger than human populations.Yup. But were diploid and sexual so were better and linking to different beneficial alleles together. You cant make the argument that these mechanisms operate too slowly in humans for our evolution to be possible. There are other mechanisms at play that this model ignores.ampnbspgtCan you link me to some context for this graph?The vertical axis is frequency so the thickness of each color indicates the percentage of the population with that genotype. In the upper panel theres recombination so when the aB and Ab strains meet the beneficial AB genotype rapidly appears and becomes dominant.In the lower panel theres no recombination so each mutation has to occur in sequence to get the AB genotype. So the aB lineage gets outcompeted by Ab this is called clonal interference and then the B mutation has to occur within the Ab lineage to arrive at AB. Behes model operates as the lower panel illustrates. But everything even haploid asexual bacteria operates as the top panel illustrates. Ignoring that mechanism invalidates his findings. ampnbspNow there are of course hotspots and coldspots for recombination particularly in the human genome and probably generally in animal genomes. But were talking every few thousand bases in a genome of almost three billion. Thats still hundreds of thousands of hotspots littering our genome. And bacteria are less picky about where recombination occurs its often associated with integrated mobile genetic elements unsurprisingly but happens at a pretty robust background rate. So the argument doesnt hold for Behes model. Hes estimating the rate at which a very limited set of evolutionary process can generate a new trait in a population that is ten million times smaller than that in a single ton of soil. There is no way these results can be used to draw broad conclusions about the rate or scope of evolutionary processes as a whole over time. Its completely without merit. ,Creation,df3e8f2,11,t5_2t3sv

11301001,0,t1_dfcxr3t,gt without Gods Word or as you say in the OP the issue of God there is no light or truth.ChallerLong time.  So nice to see you.I actually dont think thats what the scripture teaches.  Jesus himself saidgteven though you do not believe me believe the works that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.John If the requirement was that we have perfect understanding and perfect knowledge and a Christian worldview to believe God in our unsaved condition then none of us would be saved.  Jesus understands we may not first believe in him before we begin to see the truth.   Richard Lumsden Dean of a science department at Tulane is that of a man who first realized he was so wrong about so many things just based on the evidence.  He didnt have a Christian world view to start with but God was able to help him see the light even while his mind was in darkness.  Then Gods light broke through the darkness.From what I can tell the student that started Lumsden on the road to his conversion must have used the arguments like the one Im using.Actually finding that video inspired me to write that OP at rdebateevolution.,Creation,dfcy9ux,3,t5_2t3sv
11626972,0,t1_dgdx6dc,Ah I see.  Nothing explicit and that has always been the weird part.Evolution is generally taught as super super slow.  Then we read in the news about new studies showing how there are so many things going on at supersmall levels in each cell and we realize that the work to get a functioning cell is much higher than we thought back in the s which means that the superslow process was doing much more work than we thought.,Creation,dgdxh2t,2,t5_2t3sv
11701333,0,t1_dgkruqi,gtEven still a slight majority of failed pregnancies are due to chromosomal issues which are not counted in our  mutations per generation rate.Theres a difference between chromosomal issues and what this study noted Chromosome abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities are substantial errors in the chromosome  duplicated and deleted chromosomes or very severe structural abnormalities such that they are visible.It doesnt include fatal base pair errors which might also cause a failed pregnancy but without the easily traceable evidence.,Creation,dgmd564,3,t5_2t3sv
