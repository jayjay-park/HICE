1781875,0,t1_ck3qf3a,Ok the temp should be fine and you would think the supplied food would be ok. I noticed on that product page though that they say  weeks to metamorphose so he might not be that far off. Some individual tadpoles just take longer Ive had dart frog tadpoles from the same clutch of eggs be almost three weeks apart in the time they start hopping. Also remember that the actual metamorphosis is the very last stage and once it begins takes a relatively short time compared to the rest of the tadpole development. I know that salamanders can sometimes fail to morph and stay aquatic their whole lives but I dont think this happens with frogs. If he seems healthy otherwise I would say just be patient likely hes just a little slow. ,frogs,ck3rcj7,1,t5_2r6bj
2165396,0,t3_2jshha,Congrats my first was a gray tree frog. Id try a local reptile show even if they dont have one there you can ask around. There usually have good deals on equipment too. You can buy frogs online at some places but they have to be shipped ,frogs,clf2ln8,4,t5_2r6bj

4200625,0,t1_cryv81n,To feed him you can chop up some lettuce and boil it. You can make a bunch of it and freeze it. Commercial tadpole food is also available I think its made by zoomed. Make sure he has a ledge or something he can crawl on or help him stick his face out of the water to breath. Quick tip I didnt know when he first turns to a frog he wont need to be fed for a few days. My petsmart has tadpoles once a month or so. Apparently its fairly common for frogstadpoles to end up in the goldfish breeding facilities. If you have any questions about leopard frog or bullfrog care feel free to ask me!,frogs,crz2bxg,1,t5_2r6bj

5555721,0,t3_3r72xe,You need live or freshly dead insects ideally that are half the size of his snout. Prey must move for them to eat so if you give him prekilled prey youll have to simulate movement with a toothpick or a laser pointer.,frogs,cwlql4r,1,t5_2r6bj

7937982,0,t1_d47mv0o,Wow thats a lot of bugs! Thats very good to know though especially the behavior details. Ill have to do some research to see if maintaining a small colony is feasible. Id love to not have to drive all over the place to get them and crickets drive me nuts because they tend to be escape artists.,frogs,d48ayo1,1,t5_2r6bj
