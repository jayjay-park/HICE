1439775,0,t3_2amwuj,You can already put stuff in chat with using the  but again I feel the rule shall stand even as you saidgt its perfectly understandable to restrict content of any sort that would make someone uncomfortable.Also the fact that you got reactions like so in chat shows that this point wont change more than likely.We have no jurisdiction on what you people post and you should keep it SFW but we wont just down right ban a certain thing.,TheNightsWatch,ciwr3e8,1,t5_2uie0

1506234,0,t1_cj52t1t,Ermmm I was thinking something more along the lines of WoW legit style MMO. Guild Wars Yes I know thats PP just an example. or my personal favorite Lord of the Rings Online. Runescape is and pardon me if I am not fully correct as I dont have much experience a limited browser based game and does not provide the full vision I was thinking of. Please do not be offended as I only meant to show you my point. Thank you for your suggestion though. ,TheNightsWatch,cj52xg3,1,t5_2uie0

1681950,0,t1_cjr5j2l,It wasnt that you werent allowed on rangings. It is that you arent allowed to be told because that information isnt supposed to leave the ranks of recruit. I feel like that is a huge misunderstanding Radar. It was never that we didnt like you or want you to attend. We just wanted you all in or all out because that is how the Watch works. This doesnt change the fact however that someone is outright breaking a rule that has been in existence for  years. A majority of the Council worries about the risk this poses and want to resolve it. You are the common denominator. And if you cant tell us who is breaking the rules then we have to work with what we have.,TheNightsWatch,cjr686y,1,t5_2uie0

1725697,0,t1_cjwo7cv,My actual job is to plan and lead rangings vote on proposals and manage things day to day. See its your pick and choose behavior that really lowers your credibility with me. You only focus on the proposals I vote no on the time I yelled at your buddy for deserting and the times I tell someone off for acting childish who you are friends with. You dont mention the votes I call for or the votes I pass or the times I do these things with people you arent friends with. You want to base it off of how people do their jobs yet you only call out  people and ironically the more active ones. Since you this is currently the longest civilized conversation youve had with me id love to actually go over on a case by case basis to try to figure out why you select certain members for judgement. Go ahead and pm me if you want. Tell me how you feel about each council member.I honestly cant tell if you have a victim complex or are a drama queen that would put teen girls to shame but this is done. Votes have failed. You lost. Or... you can do what you do best and stir stuff up and cry about oppression and us being nazis. Your call.,TheNightsWatch,cjwoszy,2,t5_2uie0
1725926,0,t1_cjwppyz,gtVoting for a council didnt work two years ago I dont understand why you think it will now.I have made changes to the system that correct all of the major problems that we had in the previous election system. Not all elections are the same.gtHalf of the watch isnt unhappyThe majority of privates includes at least half of all members.,TheNightsWatch,cjwpuek,2,t5_2uie0
