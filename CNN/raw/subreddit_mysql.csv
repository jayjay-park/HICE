4228584,0,t1_cs1rnuw,With XtraBackup you can actually compress the backup as its being created which... well compresses it as its being created  that way it takes up less space. You can pipe it right through an SSH pipe while its being created  so its only written to a remote disk.You can do incremental backups You are going to have to do some stuff to create the backup again when its done but its a much safer to use this.If you are going to go this way Id recommend doing a single full backup once a week or something then incremental from there always based on the first one so its only one restore step.Its going to take longer than snapshots but a snapshot backup if not consistent doesnt matter anyway  not if consistency matters to you here.,mysql,cs28jpc,1,t5_2qm6k

Your method is prone to race conditions which I guess would be one way to get the behavior youre observing.Your validation function is needlessly complex if youre going to require umich.edu to be the domain you can greatly simplify your regular expression.

8768125,0,t3_4zwb0u,Views are nice for a few cases You very frequently want to access a filtered view of the table e.g. lets assume you have an active boolean field on a table and you almost always only want to see active entries.  This way you could define a view with where ltcolgt is  so you dont always have to remember to include that in other queries  just use the view. You have a complicated query that you call frequently e.g. maybe with many joinsSELECT colA colB colCFROM tableAinner join tableB using someidinner join tableC using someid...inner join tableZ using someidThats a lot to type and remember ... instead you could just define your view as that query then your users could simply performselect  from myviewBut if you havent run into either of these issues dont feel like you have to find a way to use views.,mysql,d71oguh,2,t5_2qm6k
