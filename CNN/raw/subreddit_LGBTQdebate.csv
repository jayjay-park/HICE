6172134,0,t3_403gmp,Honestly I dont personally care that much but society cares. Society cares that it be called something different and lesser. And society will continue to recognize it as something different and lesser as long as it is called something different. It smacks of legal rights vs loving relationship kind of distinction.I wouldnt be effected hugely personally but think of children and so forth.,LGBTQdebate,cyr7hkk,1,t5_3br0u

6276994,0,t3_41k1do,whilst i dont think its inherently necessary i think it is a must as long as the current levels of ignorance and transphobia exist. having eddie redmayne star in the danish girl just reinforces the idea that a trans woman is a cis man in a dress which is extremely harmful in a world where many people dont understand what trans means and some of those that do actively hate trans people. perhaps in the future a cis person of the same gender as the trans character can play them which in my opinion is better than someone of a different gender playing the role. ,LGBTQdebate,cz34g9i,4,t5_3br0u
6428117,0,t1_czk5frf,Regarding your answers to  and  your answers make sense to me.gt  Traditional and sexist beliefs are easier to overcome because theyre easily disproved by education. Most people that hold these beliefs are a little stupid. source my mother.I get your point and agree. But what I was trying to get to was how much would it affect the social pressures the trans person was exposed to growing if they grew up in a more egalitarian household vs one that is more traditional? Would you see the same kinds of things? gt amp I dont think it gets cancelled out i feel like the damage is done already why would you think transition has reversing effects? I didnt mean cancelled out. But like you never stop being exposed to social pressures even once you are older  theyre constantly still shaping you. So if someone who is  lived the first  years being perceived as male and thus being exposed to those social pressures and then lived  years being perceived as female and thus being exposed to those social pressures what does that make that individual? Would there be any of the effects of that male socialization that would then have been alteredshapedchanged by the female socialization they have since been experiencing?gt im not sure what you mean by the last question. I love confident arrogant people why would i react differently to any of them..Sorry sounds like I didnt explain myself well.I guess what Im asking is what is a sign of male socialization? For example one of the things you sometimes hear trans woman accused of is the idea of trans entitlement which which to me sounds like they are being accused of acting too belligerently angrily insisting about getting their voices heard. Which sometimes leads to the accusation that they are still acting as if they had male privilege. However there are also some cis and genderqueer women who act in a belligerent loud and domineering way  but while they may be called a jerk they wouldnt get accused of still acting as if they had male privilege. So then how would an observer go about trying to figure out what actually is someone just generally being a jerk and someone being a jerk because they were brought up while exposed to male socialization?Also again thank you for engaging in this discussion I am enjoying the insights you are providing me about your perspective on this issue,LGBTQdebate,czk7e8l,3,t5_3br0u
6505843,0,t1_czs8hoi,A cis straight person is not LGBT. A mostly lesbian woman is not a lesbian. Im not pretending that women being attracted to men is a thing that doesnt happen its the dominant experience for women. No one treats it like a secret. Im saying that it doesnt happen for lesbians it does happen for bisexuals. If it happens to you you are a bisexual. There is noting wrong with being bi Im not sure why you feel the need to fight for their right to claim they are homosexual. The Kinsey scale doesnt jump from  to    and  exist and are completely and totally valid experiences. Its just incorrect to say a  is mostly a . Im not telling you that you have to tell your friends that theyre wrong. But if they are attracted to men they are bisexual. By definition literally by definition. I dont understand why this is such a problem. How does it hurt people who are attracted to men to accurately represent their sexuality? ,LGBTQdebate,czs94cy,5,t5_3br0u
10435982,0,t1_dcqy06r,At BEST youre wholly out of touch. Thats really putting it lightly. If you think being queer is cool you really really need to educate yourself. Look up Cece McDonald and Islan Nettles when you get the chance. In your rant you also said your coworker went trans changed their name and everything as if you think their transition is a new diet craze or something. You dont go trans like you go vegan. This is more than a matter of semantics because you actually seem to think being queer is like a chic trend.Also you have to understand that being trans entails more than bullying. Its literally most of the people around you and powerful institutions invalidating your personhood telling you that you are illegitimate for literally your whole life. Try developing selfhood in that kind of environment of forced correction. Try going to vote or go through TSA. You grow up as someone else because youre literally not allowed to be yourself. And when a trans person comes out they are fighting this coercion and correction often with every bit of strength and resistance they have left. This visibility just invites more people and institutions to correct them and silence them into normative identities. This a very substantial and violent tradition spanning hundreds of years. Look it up. It is different from being darkly complected because at least your peers family members and doctors are not telling you that you literally dont exist because of the way your body looks. If someone calls you a slur theyre expressing violent prejudice but with trans people its a kind of twoheaded violent prejudice that says you aint shit AND your identity is also false. You not only insult a person on the basis of how they express themselves but also tell them that their expression is actually a delusional lie. So when you repeatedly misgender a trans person who you even call a friend its not just a slip of the tongue or a simple little inconsequential occurrence. Its actually pretty fucking offensive and invalidating. Imagine that every time you do that its not just read as your singular technical mistake but as a part of a much larger and very deliberately violent effort to delegitimize their identity. This is psychologically and emotionally destructive whether you intend it to be or not. And even if transphobia didnt exist its still shitty to refer to someone as anything else than what theyve asked to be called. To do so several times and then find fault with THEM when they get upset is just delusional and petty. Youve actually made yourself a victim when you are the one wielding more power in these situations. You complained they didnt get you. Thats really outrageous. Its incredibley distorted and insensitive when literally almost no one gets trans people not even their own fucking families the government voter registration healthcare companies or the doctors who misassigned them at birth. How can you make this about you?? I think you just dont like feeling bad about hurting someone and thats okay but learn from it instead of crying out for help as if youre being attacked. Youre not.,LGBTQdebate,dcqzl8k,1,t5_3br0u
