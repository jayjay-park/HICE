We have dudes making energy drink pyramids and others screaming their heads off  Dreamhack was very tame by comparison.The biggest issue with Qcon has always been the venue. Its not horrible  its actually pretty good but the size and to some extent the location has held back the con from growing. These tickets sell out in minutes the demand for a bigger con is there. Likewise there wont be more booths because theres just no room.Qcon is locked at the Hilton for a few more years I think.

I have already moved my seat once this year.  if you transfer registration to someone else basically it costs  dollars.  When you sign up your kids dont use your name use the kids information then you will not have to Xfer.
