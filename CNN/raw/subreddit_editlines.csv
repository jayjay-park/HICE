2188176,0,t1_clhy8st,First I made a project file and logged all the footage and synced everything up. Then I copied everything to an external drive and handed it off the other editor so we both had copies of everything. We kept in contact with each other on what scenes we intended to be working on at any given time. Do the work and then export the sequence as a XML file and upload it to a central location like a dropboxgoogle drive we could both access.Every day or so wed check the site and download new revisions and import them into our project watch them and give each other notes. Sometimes wed directly make changes and upload a new revision to the site as well.TAMM started out just as organized but we went through so many editors that it turned into quit a mess. Our last editor did a good job but didnt trust nesting so he took it out. After the premiere we wanted to do more work on the edit but the guy we used wasnt working for free and we couldnt afford to pay any more on the project. So I took the summer and fine tuned the edit and cut out about minutes of fat getting it to respectable minute film. At that point it was just me working so I didnt bother to go back to nesting each scene but I did break it into sections because its insane to work on a single timeline like that.,editlines,clhyy0j,2,t5_2ws2y
