Hopefully others can shed some light on their experiences.,hipaa,d2gtjf9,2,t5_2zdar
8011468,0,t1_d4gk1b7,usorklin raises some good points but I still think a BAA needs to be signed between the vendor and the Covered Entity. Do you and the CE have a BAA between you two? At this point there should be at least two BAAs one between the CE amp CognitoForms and one between you and the CE. judging by your original comments youre a thirdparty contractor of some sort right?.I also echo the need to do a Security Risk Analysis SRA and to have complete documentation of the process. Business Associates can be audited much in the same way a Covered Entity can and you will need to provide a thorough accounting of the data how it wasis secured and what steps are done to routinely ensure it is safe.,hipaa,d4gkasw,1,t5_2zdar
8011496,0,t1_d4gkasw,Oh God. What did I get myself into. Yes. Im a contractor who only set things up initially. After that Im out and dont actively participate in anything. All the data is in cignitoforms. That part is not hard. Ill see what I can do with the practice. Im probably going to have to set them up with some other kind of secure payment system that goes directly to Stripe and sign a BAA with them and the client. Thanks for the help. ,hipaa,d4gkevg,1,t5_2zdar
