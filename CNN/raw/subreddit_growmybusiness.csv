9356194,0,t3_54t5ec,I think this is a great idea but its hard to tell what market you are in when I look at your site.  Otherwise I like it.Perhaps you should consider a contract where your instructors agree to not take the clients you have referred to them for a certain amount of time... a basic noncompete clause.As a musician I wish there was an easier way for my bands to book gigs at local venues.  ,growmybusiness,d91yr1j,1,t5_2ykna

9626675,0,t1_d9zny9r,Thats none of my concern is it? Youre a fucking joke. Im here trying to offer my help to people who needs some form of MVP for their startup and here you are trying to tell me how I am supposed to read some book to teach me about Lean Startup or whatever methodology before I code but the truth is that I dont give a single fuck about this and that if whatever is in that book works you should not be spending your time on reddit replying to a probono service post which you are doing. Also please dont stereotype against programmers. Weve done nothing wrong to you.,growmybusiness,d9zop77,1,t5_2ykna

11452527,0,t1_dft457j,Thank you so much! I really appreciate the honestly and I have heard from a few of my friends that I need to be a bit louder with my messaging as you suggest. I tend to be my own biggest critic and sometimes that slows me down and keeps me from making the splashes I need to make to grow. I love the idea of popping up the upcoming events on my homepage! Thanks again for the feedback! ,growmybusiness,dfu4vjp,2,t5_2ykna
