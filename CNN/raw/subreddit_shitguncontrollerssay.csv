11598819,0,t1_dg3tt3m,Wait you want me to provide citations to prove your assertion? You started this saying the gun was sold to a prohibited person not me. If he was prohibited from buying in California then where did he get the gun? Did it just magically appear in his pocket? Somewhere someone was considered a law abiding Responsible Gun Owner enough to purchase that gun. And they were clearly not if it wound up in the hands of a felon intent on using it to commit capital murder. Unfortunately for us there is no way to know who this person was or stop them from getting another gun and selling or giving it to a felon because there is no paper trail. As long as there is a person willing to sell the gun there is no law that will prevent restricted people from getting one. As long as there are no consequences for selling the gun there will be a person willing to sell it. Really that simple. And are you talking about the same Coburn Amendment that he tried to sneak on to a water bill a few years back? The one that wanted to create a registry of federally owned firearms and allow concealed carry on army bases or some shit? I dont recall any language about a NICS portal in there. Maybe youre thinking about the Cornyn Amendment the one that would have required the government to allow terrorists to buy guns if they couldnt produce evidence of terror related activity in  hours from the application thereby completely subverting the purpose of the law? It also had wording that would have allowed for transfers between friends and family members if I recall correctly thereby making it essentially unenforceable. Isnt that the exact kind of do nothing feel good legislation youre always whining about? I mean at least pretend to have some self awareness. ,shitguncontrollerssay,dgaqgl0,0,t5_31tok
