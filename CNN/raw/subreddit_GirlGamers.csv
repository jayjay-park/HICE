8173,0,t3_1u6to1,I think its unfortunate that the picture painted when there are no women around is that men would lose any semblance of civility. Do men have such little confidence in their own civility that the only thing holding them back is the other gender? It also sorta stereotypes all guys into a very macho perspective as if all guys are immediately into guns and gore.

95326,0,t3_1v63ha,The primary argument against Alienware is that youre going to be paying a lot more for the same hardware and this is true as it is for any prebuilt system  youre paying for the assembly. So yes its true that by owning an Alienware youve paid more to save yourself the effort of building it yourself. Now thats not overpriced if you dont mind paying for the cost of assembly but if assembly is something you actually enjoy doing as many PC gamers do then yeah Alienware seems like a ripoff not only are you paying more for the same hardware but youre losing out on your building fun and youre getting a machine that you cant look at say I built that! gtMy most innate curiosity now is well why? Why exactly does this community seem to not care about the label on my computer yet everywhere populated with well unfortunately mostly men seem to get so uptight and hostile over it?I guess with a lot of guys paying to avoid the effort building the system yourself is just a strange idea. For me building a new PC is a special kind of fun that I usually only get to have every  years unless a friend asks me to build theirs too. I love building my PC so to me the idea of someone who knows how to build their own machine actively choosing not to and paying to avoid it is pretty strange.If I had to speculate as to why you dont get the same comments in rgirlgamers Id have to guess that people here are either less inclined to build their own systems or dont find building their own systems to be exciting. ,GirlGamers,cepa729,-1,t5_2rfec

And since they designed the game to be used in PlayStation  and Xbox it does not take the maximum potential of a full gaming computer to render more polygons and smooth things out because of the base game engine limitations.Some of the game cinematic scenes youve seen may be prerendered movie clips and not gameplay from the real time game engine so thats unfair to compare.,GirlGamers,cezecih,1,t5_2rfec

286652,0,t1_cfad45e,gtIm just befuddled by why things are the way they are .Well US attitudes towards sexuality are very much influenced by the fact that half of it is fairly religiously conservative. Their main problem with nudity is that they think nudity and sex being depicted would normalize a culture of sexual immorality which is anything outside sex between a married couple though they may also feel the depictions are in some sense inherently immoral or that they evoke lustful thoughts which are immoral or just pure disgust.This is an entirely different group than feminists who think the way women are depicted on the whole in media harm women in a myriad of ways. You can get people from both groups criticizing something but the motivations are different and what they consider the ideal media to be would look very different.Women gamers are a third group and any particular woman may be part of one of the previous two or neither. Speaking as someone whos in the overlap with the second this shit bothers me because aThis stuff contributes to my body insecurity of which I have an enormous amount of. Im hardly alone in this either bIt limits the variety of gameplay experiences I can find because women arent allowed out of the narrow mold of having to be sexually appealing. This is why men get a ton of games that deliver power fantasies whereas I have to replay Mass Effect for the umpteenth time to get that. cIt hurts my immersion when the internal consistency of the world is violated so women can be sexy. Prime example is Kerrigans organic heels which have no reason for existing. See also bikini armor. Men need to cover up to be protected but women mysteriously dont have to. dGames would be more interesting if we could have more variety in the characters. Right now pretty much every woman in a games is young thin straight haired with big breasts and a narrow waist. Men need more variety too but they get a whole lot more than women do currently. edoing accurate cosplays is difficult when there arent a lot of characters who have your body type. I cant think of a single anime or video game character who has my hair type for instance.Or I could be a close minded idiot. Tossup really.,GirlGamers,cfah4pl,7,t5_2rfec

310335,0,t1_cfcwmzf,Yeah this is not your average legacy story.  But Ill probably just post a series of stories on a blog site still researching the best way to do this so happy to take suggestions from the perspective of a few main characters.  The stories overlap here and there so I have to decide the best way to present it.  Whats really funny is Ive never shared a single sims story before and Ive got this massive project planned.Take a peek at my craziness real quick  I have those  sims that I will actually use in game to tell several different stories.  For the world Im creating though Im going to import premade sims  about .  I want them to all be genetically diverse and I dont want to have sims with all the same personality traits so I have a spreadsheet to keep track of those as well.My stories are getting pretty complex certain sims being born while other sims are about to die off so I have a timeline to help me see what needs to be done and by which turn.  Ive done the math to figure out a reasonable explanation for the passage of time so that the average sim age comes out to about .  A year takes five turns the lunar cycle takes  the seasons take  each  its a weird Game of Thrones kind of calendar where seasons take like . years to pass.The reason its so complicated is that I want to play the whole story out instead of just setting up a bunch of shots or cheating all over the place.  I will probably have to compromise on that point since Im sure switching households a million times is going to piss the game right off.  Also Im pretty burnt out building the world after creating  damn houses.  Itll get done eventually I guess.  After all the work in planning it I am going to finish this thing. ,GirlGamers,cfcxnf4,8,t5_2rfec

Its obvious that the protector role in a family is a male gender role.Edit You take his line as I dont care if there are female gamers they can take a hike. as not gratifying that audience.

I doubt thats what you meant to imply but stupid is a judgement and judging her for not knowing better is basically blaming her.spoilerSecond I dont agree that shes an object. Shes not dominant or assertive but she has thoughts and feelings and over the course of the game she does make certain decisions for herself. If you want to know more about her I outlined who she is exactly and what is going on inside her under Who You Play in this postBut then there of course are moments when her agency is taken away and its always by him. Her friend doesnt make her go to the party she just gives in to the social pressure there and of course she also kinda wants to go but when she decides to go home when she doesnt want to take a walk with him when she doesnt want to kiss him he makes her. He takes all her choice away and makes this happen no matter what. Thats the point that he doesnt give her a choice only the illusion of choice i.e. she can go along with him voluntarily or be forced along but it will happen and the outcome will always be the same. That he can make her because shes shy and insecure makes her an excellent victim for him but I dont agree that it makes her empty. It just makes her shy and insecure.spoilerAnyway so much for my two cents. I go into much more detail in the postmortem but I figured itd be rather inconvenient if I posted huge spoiler blocks here.,GirlGamers,cfm5ms9,1,t5_2rfec

Pouting is poor manipulative behaviour. Being firm is necessary in setting boundaries in relationships. ALL relationships. And I used the parenting analogy because raising a child very closely equates to dealing with human behaviours on all levels. I wouldnt advocate condescending to him but then I dont advocate condescending to children either. I agree we dont know the full context of the relationship. But he IS engaging in poor behaviour and setting firm boundaries will solve the issue. He probably will close off for a little bit and then if she sticks to her guns he will get over it.

Boy toys have very few figurines that are female or feminine. This may sound obvious since you know boy toys but think about what we are teaching our kids when the only toys we give them are only of the same gender or same race. The idea that little girls only want to play with female characters and little boys only want to play with male characters is both false and a socially constructed ideaselffulfilling prophecy.We are teaching our kids to have boys club values and it is not healthy.But there is not much more to say really.

Everyone is different and everyone enjoys different things.Doing nerdy things because you think it will increase your intrinsic value to others is a bit like smoking cigarettes because you think other people will think youre cool for smoking.

Constant streams of rape jokes prostitute jokes as well as racist jokes which dont affect me but still piss me off make it hard to feel comfortable and after confronting these men they just laugh me off or give some shitty excuse as to why its okay. Fortunately when were in class the lecturers will stop it going too far but it still occurs and the lecturers only ever step in when I make a fuss over it.The gaming community is twice as bad with noone in a position of authority to prevent this occurring  which is why I dont participate in online gaming at all.

There wasnt  a character creation screen but they definitely had male and female. I just cant remember if you chose the class first then the gender or if the gender was tied to the class.Also I liked Torchlight II.

There are times when GlaDOS talks to Chell about Chell herself testing and many other things. Merely talking about Cave Johnson or Wheatley at some point does not make the game fail.The game would fail regardless of Chells status as a character if GlaDOS did not talk about anything other than Cave and Wheatly for the entire game.

1351328,0,t1_cilo125,Well and I know this is going to sound strange. But Im sort of glad they dont just get rid of everyone who utters a sexist or racist comment. There are a lot of times where Ill be venting to a guy friend about some person in game or how I hate that I have to decide Do I want to use voice chat and win this round of CSGO or do I want to remnain silent not help my team but at least I know I wont be harassed and a lot of them dont even really believe that its that bad. One time I was playing CS we lost because I had to type any call of location rather than speak I mean we lost for other reasons too but you know what I mean and I was venting to a guy on mumble about it. He asked if I was going to play more and I was like nah lets play dota. Well he was asking can it really be that bad? so in the game of dota we got in to I used voice chat to make calls or whatever and right out of the gate this guy on our team started gg girl gamer we cant win blah blah the usual dumb shit. But I was able to accurately demonstrate that I wasnt blowing these things out of proportion. Now Im not saying Oh lets keep the sexists around so that my grievences can be proved accurate but Id much rather just give severe punishments but eventually the offender gets to come back. I like the way dota  punishment scales. So it isnt just  hours  hours  hours. A guy I play with who admitedly talks a LOT of trash once had a  hour chat ban. If that doesnt deter you from being a prejudice douche then that person is hopeless anyway. So maybe with a scaling punishment it gets to a certain point and then youre completely banned or something?Idk I like to think that people who talk trash based on racegenderwhatever are sort of just ignorant to what theyre really saying? And maybe after various punishments and knowing that if they keep it up then theyre going to be outright banned maybe theyd think Oh well this obviously isnt acceptable.I also dont think that outright banning people everytime they offend someone is actually effective at curbing offensive behavior. I mean yes I get harassed for being a girl and its annoying. Im not saying we should just learn to grin and bear it because while I can brush a lot of it off sometimes it can really get to me and sort of ruin that game session but if we banned people everytime they were offensive thered be no gamers left.Im not going to pretend like Im some amazing super friendly player. I talk trash and I talk a lot of trash to white knights who think that telling me over and over how pretty my voice is or how sexists are bad or whatever isnt just as bad as the idiots who spew kitchen jokes. At least the kitchen joke gg girl gamer idiots are just mad and look to any reason to make personal attacks such as if youre brazilian or female or maybe you have an avatar for some anime or something idk but white knights get to me way more than those guys. So when I call these dudes neckbeards or creeps or friendzoned fedoras my personal favorite couldnt they report me then? Maybe not for being sexist but certainly being hostile and insulting their choice of headware.I just think complete platform bans is a slippery slope to just shielding people from the problem. Also all the people who get perma banned for doing whatever if it was because of a girl they might become even more hostile to women. I mean if these are the type of people who legitemately think that girls only play games because we want attention from these ohsodesirable fellows then theyre probably the same idiots who would place blame on anyone but themselves. They wont think Oh well I got banned because I was an asshole and now I should change my ways theyre just going to stew in the thought that women are ruining everything and were all feminazis and weve turned valve and xbox or whoever against them with our powerful feminist agendas.Ive also had dudes harass me in game and then the next day message me on steam saying Dude Im sorry I was having a terrible day and it doesnt excuse me taking it out on you and Im really sorry. Ive been there Ive had a shitty day and I get on and I get in a game where my entire team is russian or something and Ive got nothing against russian but I cant read it nor understand it so it makes it horribly frustrating when I cant communicate with my own team and theyre pinging me and screaming in russian or something and Ill say in all chat Well gg my team only speaks in hieroglyphics that could easily be considered offensive and it was just a comment made beacuse I was frustrated.So idk repeat offenders yeah they should probably get perma banned at some point but I dont think banning every single sexist is actually good for the gaming community as a whole.,GirlGamers,ciloi7e,9,t5_2rfec

1458222,0,t1_ciyuyo0,Im not remotely suggesting pandering to the audience.  Im suggesting that the comics industry should increase the number of female content creators if they really want to appeal more broadly.  The industry was founded on predominantly creating product for young males.  The vast majority of comics published in the last  years have aimed to appeal to that audience and only in the last decade that major publishers have sought to broaden their market.  Now more than ever the industry is fighting to shed the image exemplified by popular media like Big Bang Theory.Thats what this is about.  This is a big move by Marvel  Thor is one of their Alist titles... and this is a move to market that title to a wider audience made plainly clear in this interview with Time magazine  Im totally in favor of that and I hope publishers large and small continue to do so.  However in my opinion having a creative team that actually included a woman or two might have made this move feel less like a PR gimmick and having a more equal representation of male and female content creators would do more to generate the market appeal theyre aiming for.,GirlGamers,ciz2aj4,1,t5_2rfec
1460252,0,t3_2avzsh,I would find it interesting to see a game with more realistic breast physics. The only breast physics Ive personally seen is basically  differing levels of jiggling. My breasts change shape swing and sag as well as jiggle. I think that having weight to them would make them feel more like a part of the character instead of nearlydisembodied floating stress balls that are clearly there only for tittilation.Tldr It would be cool to see breast physics that are meant to actually simulate breasts not just simulating jiggling. If its between jigglingonly and rock chests I personally prefer rock chests.Also as someone with large breasts it would be hilariously great to see a quicktime event where my character is doing something upside down and I have to move before they suffocate me.

In fact you might want to check out the Humble Bundle website which is a paywhatyouwant for a pack of games. Youll get steam keys with your purchase. Heres a link to their weekly saleAnd you can often pick up older games for a very low cost at Good Old Games They have a sale today on a bunch of games.

1557836,0,t3_2c39vj,I didnt entirely skip AC but I didnt finish it. I played few hours tops and probably completed like  of the game. The only thing I got out of this experience was the knowledge who Altair and Desmond are and some basics of movement in the game. AC is totally skippable if you want to avoid any possible confusion make sure to read up the plot on Wiki and that will be more than enough. AC ony takes care of Altair in AC you start up as a new character Ezio the bridge between all the  AC games is Desmond up until Black Flag I think. So yeah read up on who Desmond and Altair were who are Assasins and Templars and more or less what happened to Desmond in AC and youre set. And by read up I mean maybe read a few sentences not some elaborate essays  The plot isnt very complicated. Anyway though Im pretty sure that even without this knowledge you will find your way around AC I just think the experience is a bit better if you make it full. If you keep playing ACRevelations focuses a bit on Altair although you still play as Ezio so any info you got on him prior to this game will make your experience more interesting imo.  Have fun. The Ezio trilogy is awesome and AC is one of my favourite games!,GirlGamers,cjbjqvn,3,t5_2rfec

However this is a topic of discussiondebate when it comes to culture and things like streetgeneral harassment of women by men as well as men dismissing womens agency. Personal example A week ago I was on the subway and this guy sitting next to me kept trying to talk to me asking for my number  trying to give me his number and basically not respecting every form of No that I gave him. I said I wasnt interested I said no thanks I dont want to I dont want your number Im good and yes I even mentioned being in a relationship in the end but he would not stop. Well you should take my number just in case.  I could tell him no in either of the two languages we both spoke and it was not good enough. We only had one more stop to go until the end so I didnt change seats.

If I said thats how I observed it would you consider me wholly biased or wrong on the matter? Because I realize how intense and almost suffocating the level of debate has been on this matter but I do genuinely think from what Ive seen that its worth looking into. All this anger indignant outcry and drama isnt coming out of just a story about someone cheating though the general Reddit mood on cheating is usually clamoring for the perpetrator to be hurt in the genitals. I think theres a lot more to it than juss miss Quinn and the infidelity rather a buildup resentment to the videogame journalism indiedeveloping community and the community in general.

1833835,0,t1_cka5ow4,gt But why? If a woman writes a romance novel with some musclebound Fabioesque character or a gloomy teen vampire I wouldnt consider that sexist. Its a sexualized character designed with female readers in mind yet still doesnt try to claim that a gender is better than the othereh depending on the circumstances yeah id consider those sexist. Or at the very least bad writing. A character that exist for the sole purpose of being there for another Ill call this Agra from wow syndrome or to focus and design to pander to a sex by objecting the other is wrong. I mean its one thing to write a character who likes looking good and designing a character for the sole purpose to give a particular RL gender wood.

Im not debating who its applied to Im saying that in wearing a super aggressive shirt like that youre directing that sentiment at everyone who reads it. Thats the kind of angry statement that again is justified in response to something dickish and bigoted. Its not justified when thats the message you broadcast all day.Yes the people reading your shirt might not be male or have power fantasies.. but then why wear the shirt in the first place?

2025943,0,t1_ckxbzw1,Apathy is support. Atleast when they defend the status quo. Im just going to state that pretty frankly to start with.If people would rather have the status quo continue to exist than make things better for other people Then fuck them.Also this is pretty much what allows sexism and a myriad of other damaging things to continue that the majority who does not experience it is apathetic and apologetic towards the symptoms and perpetrators.I think the Key thing on apathy here is basically If you are apathetic enough to just not engage then fine. Youre actually apathetic.But if you claim to be apathetic to the issues of women and argue against more inclusiveness in media  Then you are a dick. Because at that point youve chosen the side of the status quo you are actively engaging in the debate without informing yourself.Sadly I also disagree with you on intent. Intent in law may be paramount but we are talking about feelings as you yourself admitted in the original post.

2323609,0,t1_clyuv5c,Its not a requirement for me to have a female character but if the option exists Ill usually play as a female. If I cant play as a female Ill still play quite happily.   For most of the Bioware games I opt to play as a female for my first runthrough and then play as a male for my followup partly to mix things up and partly because then I can sex up all the characters that wouldnt get it on with me when I was a female.Mass Effects the one example where I just couldnt play the male but that was because Jennifer Hale set the bar too high for me and MaleShep couldnt compete. That has nothing to do with Mark Meer and everything to do with the awesomeness of Jennifer Hale.I will also say that in MMOs I used to play male avatars because other players would be jerks since Im not the best MMO player and theyd chalk it up to my being a girl. My brother was the opposite where he always played female characters because male players would give him stuff heres a  sword of killing things.  I dont need it.  Youre purty.

I just had a friend who was in the Navy and thought Id give him a bit of a tip of the hat.  Seriously irritated that I have no hacking points  going to have to remedy that right away.  Have to admit I feel a bit dazed and a step behind with this game.  Not sure if its because Im not finding controls and screens intuitive or if Im just slow and scared. From the very first seconds of the game you can really see the kinship with Bioshock.  I think that the connection with it is part of the reason that Im so edgy.

I still dont think youre being fair to his Zelda though  I dont think that hes demonizing femininity in that design at all though a little boy or a little girl in a green tunic simply dont look that different from one another particularly considering that Link was already fairly androgynous to begin with...

For examplegtWhen the gamergaters start showing actual adult interest in actual conflict of interest and not on childish prurient drahmaz over wild and meaningless allegations of other peoples sex lives as rationale for harassment  and stop flooding this talk page with fixation of the same then there may be reason to treat the comments here as anything other than childish lashing out by sexually repressed basement dwellers.

Liberals are the new Scientologists as far as Arbcom is concerned.This is badly written as it doesnt make clear what this means without prior knowledge of wikipedia disputes. So there used to be the scientology page which also had lots of disputes pro scientology people and anti scientology people fighting it out on wikipedia.A previous decision by ArbCom banned a lot of accounts from editing the Scientology page so now the extremists on both sides were gone the neutral people that were driven out by the extremism came back and now they handle the page and there is no more trouble.So if this would become the new Scientology then that would mean that both the extremists Pro and Anti gamergate would be removed so that the neutral editors can edit the pages. Nothing wrong with that.gtOvernight the one member of ArbCom who is known to be a woman voted against some of the worst measures and there are some signs that the final decision might be slightly less bad than the initial proposal. At this hour they remain a disaster.This is bullshit it paints this as a lone woman fighting off the oppression the worst measures were sometimes voted against by enough people that they couldnt pass But if he said something like there was no majority for some of the worst measures then he couldnt make the ArbCom look like a conspiracy or something to flush feminists out.,GirlGamers,co07paw,9,t5_2rfec

But increased budgets for graphics is something I couldnt be more against already. Deus Exs engine may have been stitched together with playdoh saliva and string but at least it compensated with depth and the budgets in this industry are already completely out of control. This is a business where Resident Evil  can sell  million copies and be disappointing to its publisher.gt Obviously there are other examples like Skyrim but that game strikes me even more as artificial paddingSkyrim doesnt do padding. It just fills its world with stuff and gives you the option to do it you can do the main story alone without having to touch a single side quest. Better yet Skyrim actually makes its side quests fun and makes you want to do them theyre dynamic expansive and feel extremely organic. Dragon Age just puts a wall in front of you and asks you if youve fucked around enough yet to progress.gt Disagree about the Bioshock games but I think youre talking more about writing mechanically than about narrativeI was speaking about both. BioShocks overriding narrative is interesting and kept me going while the dialogue that Andrew Ryan had was thoughtprovoking enough for him to be intriguing but evil enough to be hateable.gt Battlefield is one of the two premier franchies and definitely doesnt rely on corridor shootingYoure thinking too literally. I dont mean inside a building and a literal hallway I mean overly linear sections that are about as organic a conveyor belt. Every shooter has to be linear but they can at least give you freedom inside that path to the end of the level. The original Doom games understood this the levels are a path to the end but the rooms are big and open allowing you to strafe and use terrain to take down enemies. Even the new Wolfenstein got this the levels are still oneway but theyre dotted with big open sections with multiple routes of attack. Final Fantasy XIII spends a lot of its playtime outside but its still set in a corridorlike level design.I didnt play Battlefield  but from what I remember of  it was so tightly controlled it was goddamn suffocating. Absolutely no freedom inside the levels whatsoever just move ahead to the next objective point do exactly what the developers intended as if you were just lobotomized and cant grasp the concept of agency. Even when you get in a damn airplane all you can do is shoot an onrails turret. Its unimaginably boring. Play that then go back and play Painkiller from  and tell me if you dont prefer that kind of shooter fastpaced running around circlestrafing action with massive Freudian weapons fired on demons from hell.

Like Amy from Zanzarah or Kate from Syberia or Jade plus it doesnt necessarily fit the whole theme of the Ms Malecharacter episode which is more about how you designate a character a female when you have only very few pixels or things that arent humen while Lili is comparatively a fairly realistic female then again maybe the recommendation is less for Lili as a character but more the various NPCs in the game which do have an usual look and I think particularly for the baddies female and male look the same and you really can only guess by reading their bios,GirlGamers,co828ss,1,t5_2rfec

3165843,0,t3_2wdnlp,Fantastic read. I played FF some when ARR came out and for someone who hates MMOs its one of my favorites. And i actually just resubbed recently cause a friend was interested in playing and i found my fondness for it return. It just does lots of little things different than other MMOs that really make it feel good. Its letting you be every class and crafter. Its cross class skills. Its repeatable quests that take the grind out of leveling certain things. Its letting your mount fifgt with you and levling it up. Its making crafting a puzzle game unto itself a minmaxxers wet dream. But you nailed what ends up turning me off of MMOs. Having to repeat the same dungeon just for a chance to get a drop is just the worst idea. I hate verrical progression. Ive never got to endgame in any mmo but I know it just wont be for me.

3171143,0,t3_2wf7p0,I had trouble understanding the authors point as it relates to gaming tbh. It seemed like he is just saying to make the lady chars affect the story as well instead of just being strong or powerful? That just seems rather obvious to me though.I will add though that I would like to see less of these troperrifically strong female characters that have come to define realistic women. In my DampD game my group mostly male voiced a rare objection to my characters as they became ever more quirky and loved things like kittens and rainbows  because its not realistic! In a game of fireballs and dragons and glabrezu its unrealistic for my female chars to have traits that I a real woman possess! I think its because the boring strong female character that is so serious to the point of dourness has come to strictly define what female characters should be like. Ofc these characters are expected to also have obligatory female weakness and timidness  la Metroid Other M or Tomb Raider. You certainly can NEVER be a girl that is both fearless and loves kittens. rant,GirlGamers,coqor6b,2,t5_2rfec

I like to laugh more than I like to cry be angry or anything else that is more complex than my jaw is hurting from laughing too muchWhich is probably why I love Krieg the Psycho from Borderlands  so much. Nevermind that hes absurdly powerful his whole gameplay relies on doing things the other characters generally dont benefit from.

3406655,0,t1_cpgihnz,Actually Polyamory is probablytheoretically the ancient default for hominids.humans as is with every great ape. Primates are share a trait of non monogamy in their behaviors with various forms and variations.Humans and other hominid women in ancient times practiced whats called Polyandry a mating strategy where a female has sexual relationships with many different males. Most primates do this and the shape of the human penis supports this. The reason for a female to have sex with many males in a polyandrious species is for the social inclination that none of the males are completely aware they are the father and all the males in the group have more of a reason share in the duties of raising and protecting the child.Whether or not this is true is just theoretical but people seem to forget that humans are infact animals and still primates.The reason that we all have such a poor understanding of polyamory in the modern era is because were all so shoehorned into believeing that monogamy is the only option especially during our most recent history.Exchanging of Rings finding the one true love! romance novels and movies. Were all sold that monogamy is the only way to go and we view anything deviating from that holy matrimony to be decisively wrong.The share of political wellfare and kingdoms drove marriage to be a greater idea for control and and securing wealth during the ancient times of society and as such it was an immitation for those whom were poorer to imitate.,GirlGamers,cpgl0vc,1,t5_2rfec

3475595,0,t3_2zxzpb,Being treated normally while playing should be a given. The fact of a lady being present shouldnt be a cause for behaviors to start or stop.  What you are talking about is being treated with basic human dignity.  Would someone walk up to you on the street and hand you naked pictures I certainly hope not.  If  friends are discussing it and one wants to see some naked pics the other has and wants him her to send them great power to them.  That is consensual behavior between two people capable of doing whatever works for them.

Just keep it up and keep a record of how to do and not do things for future club runners. Do NOT set gender stuff into formal rules until absolutely needed even then aim for neutral and go for behavior keep it as best practices until then.As for getting more women present unfortunately I can see only two ways to manage it. First is keep doing what you are doing and hope word of mouth about the quality filters to nonmembers and gets them to show up. Youll just have to get the female members who want a closer to balanced ratio to just be out there talking to and getting other women to join.The second is what you said you dont want to do find everyone who doesnt want to show up because of the historymaleskewed gender balance and tell them your doing a womens day for a while to see how they like things without that concern. If that works then you set another weekly day where EVERYBODY shows up. If THAT works then you just devolve the womens day and everybody day into just everyday whoever wants to be there but now with hopefully an improved roster and balance.Youll have headaches with this regardless. Doing a women only day can have a get out vibe to your male members and cherrypicking the safest guys to show up for a not completely womens day can be a cause of resentment for anyone not picked. ,GirlGamers,cqkbkzd,7,t5_2rfec

4224453,0,t1_cs1mlwl,gt Witchers apart from being shunned by society also have troubles with their emotional state and if speaking about the physical disadvantages a good example would be their infertility caused by the mutations.I know that. You know how I know that? I read it in a glossary in the first game after twenty hours of play. Now if I were the writers of that game I would be banging my head on the desk in shame for that. If you force the player to revert to a glossary to understand whats going on in your story rather than take the Deus Ex Wolfenstein or MEDA route of using the glossary to enhance the experience you have failed in your duties as a writer.And as Ive said before I have issues with the very premise of a character who cannot show emotion. Characters who cannot show any emotion are  by definition  impossible to empathize or identify with. Im a human as are the rest of your audience you must play into that. No story is good enough to have me hooked on the plot alone I have to care about the characters. And how am I supposed to care about a character who treats the people he allegedly loves like theyre a rival business partner whose wife he slept with? Better yet heres a compromise. Delete every story in all three Witcher games and start again with Geralts amnesia back in Kaer Morhen. Now establish that something screwed up in his head when he lost his memory and he can finally feel and express emotions again. However he cannot remember anyone whom he knew he cared about and therefore feels terribly alone and lost in the world. Therefore the series is all about Geralts journey of trying to reclaim his memory while trying to reconcile the humanistic man he is now with the stonefaced man he once was. There goal motivation struggles and flaws all summed up in a paragraph. All the essential elements for creating a good character.,GirlGamers,cs1rl0t,0,t5_2rfec

4734566,0,t1_ctpbz9y,Id describe Dirty Bomb as a more serious TFSmite smashup.It rotates through characters that allow players to either buy them for real money. USD last i checked? Im not too sure that was th eprice. or for in game credits. k. to put that in perspective Ive usually gotten k for my first win of the day. There are also missions that refresh on a timer after you complete them for more credits.The real drain is the loadouts. This is where you change the weapons and buffs to your characters. Like Take no fall damage reload quicker switch weapons faster. Better Smg better shotgun better AR and so and so forth.Thankfully the rarest of loadout cards arent restricted to cash only Technically you can trade up lower grade cards for rarer cards. But its like  to  and later  or even  to  as you move up the rarity.Again thankfully you can specify WHO you want the loadout card to be for. Theres no Spend  cards and get a rare card back for a character that you dont even ownplay.I believe TotalBiscuit has a couple of Dirty Bomb gameplay videos up. I dont know if Alienware still has codes but I picked up a couple of codes that gave me some fairly decent loadouts and some extra credits.And I think if youve ever played a Nexon game they might have sent you an email saying come play Dirty Bomb and get some free items. I know they did for me since I played Vindictus. ,GirlGamers,ctrc203,2,t5_2rfec

4775803,0,t3_3g9tpj,Their has been a huge shift in marketing and game design in recent times. It also lines up with the same shift in anything IT related. Anything tied to technology construction or engineering shifted to be boys toys. I remember commercials used to go through leaps and bounds to make sure they showed just as many girls as boys playing with video games and as I got older those went away it was always boys and I feel like something was lost there.I believe that marketing push is dragging everything else with it advertising to men exclusively encourages fewer women to buy. That spurns fewer games for women as time passed pushes the women who do like those games out as it turns into yet another mens club.Even though Im a total gamer geek have a giant steam library and probably put a couple dozen hours of game time in each week theres still times where I hide that I even play video games and put that away because of stigma and fear of being rejected for liking what I like.,GirlGamers,ctwj6e7,26,t5_2rfec

The villain should act according to his or her values  those values might be heinous but they should exist. But Im not sure they need to believe that it is needed. Maybe they want something like Mad Hatter from DCAU who is what youd get if a nice guy was a Batman villain.

5032076,0,t3_3juufc,I agree that when I dont see myself represented in games continuously as much as I try to shake it off it starts to feel like the games are made with only other people in mind. This is especially weird in an era thats so big on the rule of cool and other deliberate acts of fanservice in movies and games. Im white so I see myself represented in that way but the lack of disability or protagonists that are meaningfully differently abled feels like a reminder that so many people assume we cant do anything if youre not healthy in a typical way. Thats part of why its so powerful the few times diversity is explored.Plus I especially like games with a story. The story is often the same old same old. Not only is it really interesting to immerse myself in a different characters point of view but writers that are flexible enough to write from anything other than the standard point of view also tend to have a wider variety of content and goals in the story. Like not always having the story be White guy is beaten down gets super strong and beats everyone else. That same story gets pretty old after  years of playing through what is often the same story with different graphics. There are definitely games that have the typical white grizzled male protagonist and also an imaginative story but many arent. When I see a game has a unique looking protagonist especially if it seems like a story driven game I am far more likely to buy it simply because theres a much better chance that its a new story. It doesnt have to hit you over the head and say HI IM DIVERSE but if you like to play close attention to the characters and lore throughout a game there can be some really surprising and deep moments out of the blue. And I dont have to have my eyes glaze over from the boredom of the same old in between those moments like in so many AAA games. It not only makes a difference to how it feels as a gamer who doesnt fit the mainstream stereotype of a gamer but it also gives a positive hint as to what the game might be like. ,GirlGamers,cusk1li,19,t5_2rfec

Dating is like a miniscule aspect its more about management of the kingdom and compared to a visual novel the ratio of meaningful decisions or text is very in favor of the decisions and a lot of the visual novel part is actually hidden in flavor text that most people probably dont even notice. Note that its also intentionally hard if you check out their trailer. People jokingly call it the Dark Souls of visual novels  Its a pretty unique game so I reccommend the demo so you can see if its for you.

Its a very grey realistic game with a fantastic story.The Zero Escape games kind of evoke a similar feeling I think.SOMA Spoilers below! On mobile sorry!As for SOMA I was a bit disappointed that it didnt all take place in his brain like I was convinced at first. I thought most of the game was symbolic of different aspects of him healing himself while the first monster at least was accident PTSD. The Wau interfaces if you will were actually the various hemorrhaging sites. The scan wasnt a scan at allSimon was infected with a experimental nanobots and would have eventually woken up ok.  Everything was just sort of a way for Simons consciousness to rationalize what was happening. Since your brain just floats in your skull anyway I thought that was why everything was underwater.Ultimately though I just wanted a happier ending I guess. I couldnt explain later events as well either so I came to realize my theory was totally off. I think the game is still very good and has much better commentary than my little theory.

I also think that ignoring sexist and racist insults under the umbrella of but everyone gets insulted is easier for a lot of people because then they dont have to challenge the status quo which is that gaming largely caters to white men.

5533651,1,t1_cwhb7mq,Have you actually followed what GamerGate supports and discusses? Its not at all about censoring or abusing other people. It would be good for you to read up what followers of GamerGate actually discuss because generalising them and assuming them to be the ones that sent threats is never a good thing to do. The whole us vs them is so tiring youre just encouraging less discussion by forcing negative ideas an entire group of people.Anita Sarkessian said thisgt SXSW should reinstate the online harassment panel and release a statement apologizing for including the GamerGate panel in the first place.Apologise for what? Allowing a different side of the discussion? Both panels should be allowed theres not need to try to silence the other side just because you disagree with them. You can assume all you want about their motives but theyre not even calling for harassment or for women to stay away from gaming... Of course theyre not doing that. Theres just so much misinformation being spread to slander the other side rather than trying to discuss or even listen to what they say instead people like you and Anita would rather label all of these people to be harassers with some grand scheme of claiming gaming as their own...

And like so many people who speak up on behalf of ending social structures and commercial endeavors that disempower women she has been the target of a highly distilled version of the more diffuse hate that makes those structures run which is absolutely unacceptable and I have nothing but admiration for her ability to stay calm and keep going under those conditions. Well I also have horror fear and shock that people behave like that on the Internet  and in nonvirtual life  but thats separate.All that being said yeah she wouldnt be my choice either but its a positive sign that we have made enough advances that we can even conceptualizer of a good vs poor choice of female judges.

You cant really use information from the s or s or hell even the early s and use it against everyone today. All you can say is  years ago there were more male characters in video games. But  years ago doesnt represent current trends. I dont know why people dont believe when I say women have dominated video games recently just look at every triple A title in the last  years. Theres an abundance of strong women represented in these games. Even female characters from the past like Zelda have emerged with a stronger representation. Thats not something to just brush under the rug and ignore. But to continue to look back at the past and use those negatives against the future isnt going to do any good. And it just makes you look negative.,GirlGamers,cxwdaj6,1,t5_2rfec

6024065,0,t1_cvo20iy,I have my own theoryFran Bow is a deranged little girl who is extremely emotional. She was probably mad about something that her parents had done so she killed them. However she dreamed that the monster had done it not her. So she runs away and is found by the people from the mental institution who take her in immediately. With the combination of the pills and her own mental insanity she somehow escapes and runs into the woods. This is the events of Chapter . She takes pill after pill thinking it is helping her get her cat back but really she is tripping through the forest. When she enters Ithersta at the end of chapter  she simply passed out from the medicine and went into a dream. This is where I believe she truly  becomes crazy. After she wakes up she finds itward Imaginary friend she thinks is real and with the help of his flying machine A bike she rides home. This is proven when the flying machine crashes and she is in the woods you can see a broken bike in the bottom left. She goes home with her cat and they try to get inside. Now this is where things get  tricky because she is still seeing things. When the cat goes inside the window and the doctor comes this is when reality strikes. Her cat is gone Presumed dead and she is trying to get into her home after escaping the institution. The doctor takes her and most likely tries to bring her back to the mental hospital. However with Fran being deranged she dreams of them going to the cemetery and trying to figure out her parents murder because she thinks she had nothing to do with it. By the time we get to chapter  she has already been placed back into the institution and has lost her mind. When her Aunt comes to visit her she tackles her and tries to kill her because she thinks she killed her cat when really he was never there to begin with. The Franbow story ends when the owner of the Asylum shoots her to protect Aunt Grace basically ending her life. She dreams that she is saved by all the friends she has met through her insanity. While she is dead she dreams that she is live and well in Ithersta with everyone she loves. I know its kind of creepy but this really seems like it is the case.,GirlGamers,cy99zu9,1,t5_2rfec

Having the option for a place to socialize without worrying about being harrassed is a good thing particularly if there are plenty of spaces that are still integrated.But really I think the most troubling part of your argument is that it seems to rest on the idea that women shouldnt have a space like this because itll just upset the men.

They actually removed the DS chat function in a software update because they found out that predators were using it to try and chat with children.  Having one of your marketing persons appear to defend the sexual exploitation of children while you as a company intentionally cripple one of your own products in an attempt to prevent the same is a huge conflict of interest.

Our Marketing ManageruSixOkay and I bicker like an old married couple sometimes but its because were super passionate about lots of things and want whats best for the game. We usually go on one of the infamous Coffee Walks to Starbucks and by the time we get back weve resolved whatever conflict we had to the benefit of the goal we had. That kind of working relationship is really lucky though Im sure it doesnt always happen like that.  Sometimes. It can feel a little like because were a minority we have to put in extra effort to represent women in games... but as soon as we get down to the wire as an entire studio differences melt away and it becomes people working on a game rather than men and women working on a game. Remembering that helps us just be ourselves without being self conscious about anything including our gender. I like storydriven puzzle games. Id love to make mobile games like that where its a live game where the world and the puzzles change as people play them. Maybe one day.  We have a biergarten up front. Around  on fridays people will go hang out up front and have a drink and chat about notwork. On a larger scale its a pretty small industry especially here in the DFW area. A lot of us knowhave friends in other companies and sometimes a lot of us end up in the same friend circles. I hang out with coworkers I used to work with that now work at other companies... we play DampD together.  Robot Entertainment has a list of reasons that make it an amazing company to work for. Something cool that we do is once a month we try out different food trucks from the area and the company buys us lunch! Gin and Tonic extra lime. They are my weakness. Coffee for nonalcoholic.  Pen and Paper. P If were talking Video Games then PC or PS. Or Xbox. Im not picky I just like games. Purple. Currently the color of my hair. Its fading now though. In OMD Im quite fond of Zoey. But Oziel is a close second.  If I dont say Claptrap Id be lying. I didnt create him originally but getting the opportunity to write his dialogue in the PreSequel is to this day one of my favorite experiences. Then Ezio Auditore from Assassins Creed is my otherfavorite otherfranchise character.  The program local to our area DFW is SMU Guildhall. A lot of the companies in the area have a good relationship with the college and we actually hire a lot of people straight out of school because their program is phenomenal.

I dont think theres a huge outrage but I dont think most of the people disagreeing with this stance do either.Its not about the quantity of outrage or only responding when something is an actual thing.  Its about letting your voice be heard in the broader conversation.Why not just leave it alone?  Because opinions matter.  Unless youre in the presumed majority remaining silent leads to you being taken for granted.  It also leads to backsliding caused by the pushing of those with regressive ideals.  Especially in geek culture were not that far removed from a time where content producers simply assumed that women werent present and acted accordingly.I agree that responses should be proportional but creating a subreddit post to talk about this issue doesnt strike me as an overreaction.,GirlGamers,d1y9auh,13,t5_2rfec

Theres way too much story in way too little time and theres quite the contrast between dramaticepic moments and goofysilly moments. But its not too bad.    In my opinion they should have kept the story a bit smaller in scale and take more time to have quieter scenes and character development.

I actually dont have much experience with paid editing programs that are less expensive because I normally stick to Premiere Pro but theres a bunch of free applications that are quite good in my opinion. DaVinci Resolve by Blackmagic has a free version which doesnt have all of the features but certainly enough to start out with. Ive also heard quite a few good things about HitFilm which also has a free version but I havent tried that one out myself yet. Another option might be Lightworks.

9033383,0,t3_53zi0q,As often as games oversexualise women there are a lot of companies out there trying to give a more positive image for them Ex Biowares Cassandra and AvelineWhile others that previously did are now working towards giving a more positive image or at least representing various body types instead of just the vixen League used to have strictly all big breasted small waisted vixens if human. Theyre now creating female beasts like RekSai flatchested women such as Jinx and thicker heavily muscled typesIllaoi. Which shows that theyre at least starting to put in an effort to diversify.I also find it is forgotten that men  even if its not really as sexualised of an image  are also often portrayed in unrealistic fashions in the very same video games that do it to women. Strapping muscles topless indestructible and practically emotionless as they watch everyone they care about die. Which sets a pretty unrealistic standard for men too. Not every guy can be built like brick wall.So the only way to bring this subject up without seeming biased is to make sure that characters are only compared to other characters within their game and game type as well as region. Certain regions objectify characters far more than others. Certain game types as well.EX It would be unjust to take a female character from TERAwhere both are scantily clad depending on raceclass and compare her to a male character from The Division where both males and females are dressed very reasonably for their situation.Now to actually answer your questionsHow do you feel about the unrealistic portrayal of women in video games and how has it affected you?Honestly? Not as much as it does in other media. These are pixelated women I know their appearance is unattainable and frankly I dont mind looking at a pretty face. I know their outfits are unrealistic and in no way shape or form would I want to wear a metal teddy into battle. The only thing it has done has had me opt not to buy a game if I think theyve done something I find offensive with the female form. Whatever zombie game it was that promod itself with a FEMALE TORSO in a BIKINI....thats one I opted against that I remember along with one that legit was the hero fighting in a barely visible thong and bra with excessive crotch shots during combos. I remember going Are you kidding me right now? then walking away from it.How do you think the gaming industry would change if women were as equally involved as men in the game design and development process?Of course it would. Whether it be with new ideas or different creative outlook or just targeting different markets.  Though that change would take time as the market would have to adjust to it. As open minded as some people are and as eager as some are for change there are still parts of the market that uproar when there arent copious breasts on screen or if they have to play a girl character particularly if shes not in clothes that look painted on!What I DO think is important is making sure that women are portrayed in positions of STRENGTH in video games. That they arent all dumb or helpless princesses that need a man to save them. Having strong female characters that dont depend on their appearance to get ahead but rely on their intelligence instead. For clarification I am a female gamer and I do think a lot of games are  ludicrous in their representation of women. I just think that it is a topic that often cherry picks and ignores that some of the same things are done to males. Perhaps we just dont view pectorals as sexual as breasts nor do they wiggle excessively in an attempt to grasp our attention.,GirlGamers,d7xo45y,5,t5_2rfec

We played a lot of stuff together. When he would leave for school Id spend hours practicing levels and show how him how far Id gotten when he came home.Then when my older brother started to become a teen my parents kinda divided and gave him his own things.

In an online environment you deal with them for as long as you please to tolerate them. It seems I disagree with mostly everyone in this thread though so whatever. gt just that she was asking the questionGiven the context and how the question was framed I think the author was clearly trying to push her own motives and not simply ask a question. I just dont see how a floating hand randomly rubbing against your character one time playing a demo is worth writing about. I could understand perhaps if this happened in every single VR game this person played and they actually owned VR but complaining about an isolated experience in a demo and making it seem like this is a super massive problem that will ruin female gaming within VR is just silly. ,GirlGamers,d94t65e,0,t5_2rfec

10215531,0,t1_dc0boif,I was someone anticipating that. And now Ive shared my thoughts on this matter. Overly so with a lot of text even. I really wish I hadnt because I have thoughts on this that I know from experience will not be very welcome.Full disclosure I absolutely think that child porn should stay illegal. As well as images that imitate the image of a real child which I think is still exploitative to use the image of a child who cant consent.But this VR and sexbot stuff as Ive explained in all too much creepy detail below I dont think that it should be illegal not in all cases. In the case of stuff thats not being used to groom real children and doesnt have any victims but is just a fantasy with fictional characters the question is of normalization as again there are no victims.I dont think we understand what pedophilia is enough already or what normalizes procontact pedophiles to go on their raping ways. So to make it illegal before we know all the details feels very premature. Also sexuality is a very complex thing there are a lot of people who arent technically pedophiles but who are very similar to pedophiles in various respects people who have ageplay kinks people who are attracted to physical features that adults dont normally or usually have.Throwing every single person with a concerning sexual fantasy under the bus before we know all the details seems premature. Also if you think about it making it illegal to sexualize a certain body type is kind of like literal body policing with the law.Also since these so called hyper realistic sexual VR and hyper realistic sexbots is currently just scifi and probably distant future tech by the time we have such technologies our cosmetic surgery technologies will also be light years ahead of where they are now. Meaning by the time child sex bots and child erotic VR games would or could exist people will be able to use these future technologies to look like children in real life.Then we will have ask question over whether cosmetic surgeries are wrong and should be illegal if used for purposes we deem overly youthful. Whether our claims of body shaming is wrong is absolute or whether we will make exceptions for pedo stuff. And whether we think bodily autonomy should always be respected and is an absolutely right. Or whether we also need to make exceptions to the right to bodily autonomy for the purpose of protecting children and preventing pedophilia from being normalized.If were going to consider scifi scenarios of VR and sexbots we have to take into account cosmetic surgery as well. Because thats where cosmetic technology by the time the type of sexbots rFuturology talks about will come into play. Of course right now this is all scifi.But this leads into uncomfortable territory in multiple ways. I dont want pedophiles to be emboldened and normal that their attractions to real children are normal and like they can just go out and act on them. On the other hand Im very uncomfortable at the idea of treating a body type is wrong.In the namesake of protecting children do we measure proportions and create an arbitrary line between a legal adult body and an illegal minor body? That honestly sounds like something out of a cyberpunk dystopia to me. Oh your arms are cm too small your body fits into the legal definition of children. Would you like to be sexually active or sexualize your body in any way? If so people come to the pedo correctional facility to get an appropriate adult body.Anway were a way off from this reality so we have a while longer to consider. In the meantime most things that apply to sexbots and VR legally already apply to things like childlike sexdolls and lolicon comics. So essentially societies have already been having this discussion for a while. The current VR games out there wont be that much different from the eroge that already exist and the sexbots of today arent much different from a sex doll.Any real difference right now is all scifi.I will say that some VR simulations will make me more uncomfortable than ever with sexualizing fictional child characters. There is definitely stuff I wont want to be illegal. But should it be illegal that feels like a different question.,GirlGamers,dc1zl27,1,t5_2rfec

Ive seen cards for . Id say above that is pretty good but it really depends on how much damage the team is taking too. I had one game I got around  but we literally steamrolled them and hardly took ANY damage so it was easy and I was on speedboost most of the time so I wasnt even being a good healer haha.  is good because thats almost a third of all damage.

10605502,0,t3_5rs3lk,This post about avoiding harassment in Overwatch was just posted  hours before your post and Ive been seeing more posts around harassment than I used to.Has there been an uptick in harassment in the past couple months or is it just me?  Or are more women playing online competitive games because Overwatch has brought a lot more women into the scene and this is their first sustained encounter with the level of toxicity of online competitive games?  lt and also these women are not as resigned to it as those whove been in the space for a while??Edit Yeah I think not only is there more harassment but fatigue from the current politicalcultural environment is probably making it even more difficult to cope.,GirlGamers,dd9vkch,50,t5_2rfec

10619008,0,t1_ddb9p4q,PART TWOOOOOOLoading Screen AttitudeReportPraise TipsThey have tooltips in Overwatch probably in other games too during loading screens.  If its true that most toxicity is from otherwisenormal people having bad days perhaps having occasional tips that just remind the player hey its okay please remember to be kind having a bad day? maybe take a break.  Et cetera.  If a small nudge like that could reduce  or even . of toxicity I think thats a very easy option.  Praisedefenddiscourage DialogueEmotesSimilarly adding small emotes or lines that are geared toward making peace or disapproving of bad behavior could help give players more tools to promote positivity.  Im sure many players would listen to mean things on the mics but not want to start a fight.  Talking on mics especially fightsanger is really intimidating.  But I notice when Im playing in trash level so maybe its sooo different in upper levels hahaha people love to use their gamelines just to say hello or thanks.  Having line options that say the equivalent of lets all get along or dont be sad or dont be jerks may be a gentle inbetween option from micormuting.Official BehaviorCommunity GuidelinesMy last idea is to have guidelines and then perhaps tests.  First have an easilyavailable Overwatch guideline that explains what behavior is or is not expected what Overwatch aims for as a community space and how the report and praise systems work et cetera.  Make it prominent so that people dont have to dig for example by mentioning it in tooltips or having it as a button on the splash page.  Guideline TestsThen say youve got options like tempbans or mutes or whatever for behavior.  Before theyre allowed back into playing theyre reminded of the guidelines and then required to take a small test to prove that they read it.  If its true that  of toxicity is from usuallyokay players I hope that this kind of reminder could help reinforce how seriously Overwatch takes abuse and again make them selfexamine before stepping back in.Players especially younger will have an authority directly explaining what is considered acceptable and unacceptable behavior in words.  Right now there is nothing like that.  In the lived experience of playing the game from buying it to booting up to starting a match to reporting players to exiting there is never any point that an authority or anything other than other salty players to tell players how theyre expected to behave.  Banhammers are going to feel mysterious random and unfair on their own with current systems.  After all players often arent punished immediately after bad behavior but at best after accumulated bad behavior and only if their fellow peers not any authority deems it so.By taking a test its another involved action that requires thinking absorbing the information and processing their feelings on it even if only for a few minutes.  Im sure a lot perhaps even up to the vast majority would brush off such a step in the moment and just consider it a timewasting pain.  But its one more deterrent and one more small thing that would help to explicitly reinforce expectations of behavior.EndI think that the two biggest things are first that companies show they care about their abused customers and are putting resources and priority into it that theyre not ignored.  Second that as a relatively unexplored and unresearched social wild west ultimately we just have to keep experimenting researching and gathering data to find and cobble together whatever techniques are effective. Which really just ties back into the first thing about companies caring hahaha just keep trying stuff and researchng.Lastly this is a bit unrelated but Im sorry that you apparently got downvoted so much I cant see your votes and Im sorry that it apparently gave you a bad impression of this sub.  I do believe that its unfair that you got such downvotes and it must have been really frustrating but this community while its not perfect is usually really positive and supportive in my eyes.  The karma system can be weird and sometimes people in forums like this and others can be oversensitive and let their emotions do their voting for them.

10763043,0,t3_5txtlv,These are pretty minor examples as their personalities are intact but their physical transformations bugged me.Jill ValentineBy the end of Resident Evil  series mascot Jill Valentine has been brainwashed by Wesker and is used as a servant the process permanently changing her hair from brown to blonde and she is made to wear this skintight catsuit. She is eventually freed from mindcontrol but has no change of clothes for the rest of the adventurespoiler and this has so far been the last canonical appearance of Jill she does not appear in Resident Evil  or  and Resident Evil Revelations is set before .Despite being in Marvel Vs Capcom  as Resident Evils rep for MvC she is instead swapped for famously stale bread slice Chris Redfield and was instead made DLC in her mindcontrolled statespoiler.Ashley WilliamsIn Mass Effect  and  Ashley is kickass proudly religious and looks like a normal female soldier would all practicality. Probably as a result of the engines struggle with long hair. In Mass Effect  shes suddenly wearing more makeup and wears her hair down. Not to say girl cant kick ass and look fabulous doing so but given the setting its just odd and seems out of character. Her change of looks is never addressed ingame and her religion is never referenced. I assume these changes were because of her retaking the lead female love interest role for male Shepard and to fill in the shoes of notorious Australian sexpot Miranda from ME who has had her role significantly reduced for development reasons as she can die in  and why put effort in to something some people wont see right?  Although she still has her famous ass camera shot.Again shes still cool but I would have appreciated an alternate costume with her old haircut at least.,GirlGamers,ddq4mmj,14,t5_2rfec

11541581,0,t3_64qj16,The game is pretty much based in the s the cars and styles of furniture along with the music show that. I think it was more just keeping things how they were not many women enlisted in the s beginning of the game gender roles are obvious but it does switch who runs with the child.Later on in the game female characters can find military armor and wear it you can romance female followers etc after the start of the game gender roles for your character arent really a thing there are plenty of quest that do that but there are more that dont go save a girl thing but there is also a quest where you have to help a guy tell a girl he likes her. My favorite follower is Kate she is a smart ass not to mention Paige is very spoken and believes in finding the truth at all cost.There are female leaders and male leaders and everything but the game didnt bother me at all youre not forced to wear skimpy outfits or to be a damsel in distress you arent weaker or anything. The skimpiest outfit I have found can be worn by men and women and the only difference is that the women had a top to cover their chest. ,GirlGamers,dg48nb1,30,t5_2rfec

11664977,0,t3_66fwul,Again coming from the perspective of somebody who hasnt played it and has only watched limited gameplay so far I kind of dont get the point. Im glad for the Rare superfans that got Banjo Kazooie reskinned and with updated graphics but...that seems like all the game is. Its literally Banjo Kazooie. And that was a great game yeah but...YookaLaylee doesnt do anything different from what Ive seen so far.This thing kickstarted over million. Maybe it was foolish of me but I expected them to take the classic D platforming formula and do something fun and updated with it not just literally reskin a game for nostalgias sake.,GirlGamers,dgi8nps,3,t5_2rfec
11677805,0,t3_66mf0k,Sorry Im celebrating the holiday atm so sorry if this makes no sense lol...  I have a hard time not being a completionist in games but I notice that Im evolving to be less of a completionist the older I get and the less time I have.  Its difficult at first but if you take a hard look at some of these open world games you realise that they were developed to be enjoyable and feel like a complete experience for both completionists and the kind of people who stick mostly to the main quests.  In some games skipping side quests means missing out on items or advantages that will help with the main story.  Unless youre playing on some insane brutal difficulty chances are that youll be able to finish the main quest just fine without these.  If youre playing a game where choices matter though you have to be careful  If youre afraid of missing out on the deeper lore you get from side quests... Well... You just have to learn to pick and choose what quests sound significant.  The only upside to doing any simple fetch or kill quest that only nets you items or experience is that it contributes to  completion.  Something thats helped me get through open world games recently is  turning down the difficulty.  You can always turn it back up if its really too boring.  I never used to play a Mass Effect or Bethesda game at anything but the highest difficulty but now I only crank it up for the more significant quests.  I also tend to switch between games a lot more... take small breaks from the openworld with an fps or some sort of multiplayer match.  This helps a lot when I get burnt out by the backlog of side quests a game has.  Like I  played a lot of Titanfall  during my Fallout  playthrough and the multiplayer in Andromeda is a nice break as well.  And like I wouldnt worry too much about being dedicated to finish one game at a time.  There are quite a few open world games I really enjoy but have never finished or Ill take a long break and get back to it later.My issues might be a bit different than yours though since my ADD makes it both hard to focus on one game at a time and the hyperfocus makes it hard to ignore the  completion goal.  When I find myself playing a game because I feel obligated to finish it nowadays I take that as a sign to take a break and switch to something else for a while.  ,GirlGamers,dgjp21j,14,t5_2rfec
11712331,0,t1_dg1kkvj,oh wow sorry for the late ass reply on this I totally forgot about this post. Those are in the sorta category for me since they ended up with a primarily female player base but were still kind of being targeted to both genders. I guess I more mean like an exclusively girlmarketed MMO or a flash game aggregator site with an exclusively girloriented focus kind of like the ones we have now just less virusriddled copyright infringing and messed up. One I think someone mentioned to me before was girlgogames.com but looking at it now gives me the impression its gone down the creepier avenues with surgery games and unlicensed frozenbarbie stuff now.,GirlGamers,dgnmeql,1,t5_2rfec

11775689,0,t1_dgusmq3,My view of feminism is that its the simple idea that women should be treated equally to men and deserve the same respect and rights as men and that this view also extends to how women are treated in the media. Id like to think that everybody on this sub can agree with those ideas. Maybe they dont like using that label because for stupid reasons the word feminism has shifted in the public consciousness to mean coven of manhating balltwisting shedevils who want to violate straight male sexuality at every given opportunity which has given rise to cringy labels like egalitarian but thats what feminism means to me and I wont shy away from using it because of what ever stupid connotations have been slapped on it by the Internet. Basically in my view youre either feminist or sexist. And before someone replies that Im not sexist I believe women should be treated fairly I just also do not identify as a feminist then in my worldview youre a feminist. So yes I think if youre not a feminist in my definition of the word you dont belong on this sub.,GirlGamers,dgut6ex,13,t5_2rfec
