8010027,0,t3_4orscn,Does it really have to be fixed? I dont see a problem with it the way it is now.Though it made me think of a tannery if you ever add buildings to the game. Would open up for skills like leather working black smithing etc if thats of any interest.,craftergame,d4gehes,1,t5_3cmor

8592449,0,t1_d6f6yzm,Hmm yea interesting I never needed to go over  energy per craft Id max put  of x the recipes and spam the craft button until Im out of material. If we get this a lot we can come up with something but this is only the second time  energy limit came up as a problem. And last time it came up we made the pot DHmm we need think about that video watching thing a little more. Btw what would it take for you to do an IAP or donate? ,craftergame,d6fnahn,1,t5_3cmor
8851197,0,t1_d6z1ulr,I think this might be a bug but if not it is a useful tipYou can save time by burning nonburnable items with burnable items instead of throwing them away individually. Just be careful to not burn something important!And if it is a bug can you keep it around? It really saves time when minion is treasure hunting. Burn the junk food in pots and rare stuff gets put aside. Dont have to stop and throw stuff away.,craftergame,d7bse85,1,t5_3cmor

9233975,0,t1_d8m441l,This will happen if you have the minion searching for a specific item if the item has a low enough chance to retrieve that the minion frequently grabs other items on the way. Id encountered this bug a couple of times early on in the game when I first started playing but not enough to realise it could stack. In this case though the first two screenshotted times I had it assigned to pick mushrooms and unequipped its gathering bag because I got sick of it using up  energy just for it to bring me back two rocks or six carrots or some such. The third time I just took everything off it and was gathering random stuff.,craftergame,d8mh2id,1,t5_3cmor
9406943,0,t1_d986mmg,Actually this was sort of useful to me to be honest. Seeing the Would you like to join our village? prompt repeatedly helped me to find the marketplace recipe.Another issue Ive been meaning to point out is that the time on the marketplace in the village could be listed as HHMMSS instead of the current format.,craftergame,d98e9l5,1,t5_3cmor

9544081,0,t3_5bm0wb,HelloClick minions hand. Im guessing youve only dragged it in there so far. Until recently you had to click the hand to change tools. We forgot to update the text for that. Thanks!  ,craftergame,d9pi7j5,2,t5_3cmor
