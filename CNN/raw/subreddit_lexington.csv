165309,0,t3_1vz0bq,As far as drink prices concert venues charge a lot more than normal bars. I dont think their prices are out of line with similar sized venues I go to in Cincinnati and Louisville and I wouldnt expect that to change. A bar draws you in because of its drinks and atmosphere but a concert venue has you there because of the band. Youre not going to hop out in the middle of the show to go to another bar because of better prices thus they charge more.I will agree with you on other difficulties and that absolutely needs to change but I dont see anyone building another venue soon either.,lexington,cex9f2h,14,t5_2rjxn

It was a massive pain in the ass for a while but after a few years of regular renting theyre getting a little better. We no longer have to prove to them who we are and where we live every three weeks.Id give it a .The online reservation is more of an online request. They very well may not have the car that you had reserved online. I used to work front desk in a few hotels so I sort of understand that its totally normal for companies to operate like this but its still really annoying.If its important to you tell them you will not pay unless your reservation is  accurate. That might work. Dont call in a pickup and expect them to be on the way immediately. They often just have one guy driving and it can get busy. It helps to let them know ahead of time what time you would like to picked up and from where and then call multiple times to confirm.If youre paying with a credit card youre golden. No deposit proof of residency needed.If youre paying with a debit card youll need an unopened official letter with you name and address matching your drivers license. Bring a copy of your lease if youre renting just to be safe. one make it two just cause paper copy of a bill cable electric water etc. reflecting a  balance with matching name and addressThere will be a  deposit in addition to the full price of the rental.Rental insurance is not included in the price reflected on any onlinephone reservation. If youre using a credit card its not uncommon for them to provide some sort of rental car insurance for no extra charge. Check with them first I guess.The insurance can range anywhere from day. Theyll really push it and wont mention it until they are handing you the keys but you absolutely do not have to have it. I absolutely refuse any sort of additional insurance charges anymore. They might lie to you and say they cant do that the car is not insured and that its illegal. Theyre insured on the lot they can do that and it is totally legal. You insuring their car is not your responsibility. Insurance is not dropped and pickedup at the beginning and end of every reservation. They drive these cars all over town when customers are not in them. Its a racket if you ask me. Tell them to fuck off or walk out. Or get the insurance.Your deposit will be returned to your account  hours after you drop off the keys. Or it wont and youll need to leave a friendly voice mail with the manager or show up at the office and conveniently wait until you find him.

3518083,0,t3_30jcy8,Yeah I was able to move my way up to a better position when I walked out the door of that hell after two weeks on the call floor for Apple.The training was the only good part you get paid fulltime for a month of sitting in a classroom.  Its almost insultingly easy but that all changes when you get on the floor and you realize you didnt really learn anything useful about how to troubleshoot complex iOS problems.  Most of the time we either sent them to an Apple store or escalated the call to Tier .  They dont teach you how to do anything other than resetting the phone and uninstalling and reinstalling iTunes.  Seriously thats about it.  Essentially we were talking user manuals for people trying to sync their phones with iTunes.  The folks I trained with were nice enough.  Admittedly the job doesnt always attract Lexingtons best and brightest applicants so things went slowly at times.  I cant say anything bad about the trainers or the floor managers but it was clear that the real managers the ones who werent taking calls werent my type.  They were like a cross between car salesmen and police officers.  I left after my first review.  One more point...when you work for Xerox it was ACS when I was there they make it clear you work for Xerox and not the company you are taking calls for.  That causes at least two problems.  ACS on your resume doesnt look nearly as good as Apple.  Also if you want to move up you are limited to Xerox.  Its not like Apple is going to sweep you up off the call center floor and give you an IT job.  Best case scenario is that you move up to Tier  tech support you became a trainer or floor manager or you somehow are enough of a jerkface to get into management.,lexington,cptad7e,3,t5_2rjxn

So the other issue is that energy costs in KY are in a terrible state of limbo being that they are too low to get good ROI on a solar system and yet too high to be considered affordable. So that is the solar end of things the best way to really combat your energy costs is to invest into energy efficient items such as LED lighting adding a timercut off switch to your water heater and upgrade other items for max efficiency such as getting rid of tube tvs newer LEDLCD tvs are incredibly efficient. ,lexington,d8q8ors,2,t5_2rjxn

Some have substantive mental health problems but most have just made bad choices and dont see a way out.If you want to see real poverty go hang out in Mexico. Then people can tell me how awful that panhandler is living.,lexington,dgqnhcm,1,t5_2rjxn
11764891,0,t3_67vkta,I wish Atomic Ramen Honeywood and Athenian Grill the best of luck in the food court. Not sure well get to dine at any of them very often. We live in Chevy Chase so already have an Athenian Grill. Its also easier to get to Smithtown Wallace Station or Windy Corner to dine at one of Ouitas restaurants. But Atomic Ramen might be a must stop when we need to go to the Apple Store at Fayette Mall.As for the retail? Meh. I prefer to shop online if I can.,lexington,dgtkwe3,7,t5_2rjxn

11796280,0,t1_dgwyqgo,From your linkgt Of the  violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since September   far right wing violent extremist groups were responsible for   percent while radical Islamist violent extremists were responsible for   percent. Looking at the source paper The majority of discrete events were higher for white supremacists but the Islamic attacks still inflicted more causalities overall with way less incidents meaning Islamic terror attacks both kill more people absolutely and are generally deadlier each time they occur. The white supremacist incidents average . deaths per incident while the Islamic incidents average . deaths per incident using their own numbers.If you want to take the analysis further they list victims as deaths only the Boston Bombing killed  people but injured hundreds of other people.EDITAnd to be clear my comment is not to take away from the victims of the machete attack at all. What this guy did is wrong and disgusting and Im happy they victims are going to be alright.,lexington,dgx5cuo,2,t5_2rjxn
11799265,0,t1_dgxhfh0,No idea what the crime rates of the city are I could tell you two or three areas where I know crime is higher around those areas.The city is split into  parts in my mind.  North East South and West.  Theres two areas where crime is higher.  Firstly Southside on Nicholasville Road where college students tend to live.  Obviously large universities have higher crime rates than most areas because of the higher density of population.  But Southside isnt as bad as Northside.  The North Broadway region is notorious for crime and gangrelated violence.  BUT this isnt Chicago its not really that bad in my opinion.  The streets between th street and th street can be dangerous.  Other than those two areas there really isnt much to say crimewise.  Ive walked back from bars at AM and been perfectly safe.  Granted at the same time thereve been a few reports about muggings around the area.  So maybe Im not a prime target for muggers to begin with.  My biggest advice stay away from thth street area.  But everything besides that is okay so long as you have some street smarts.,lexington,dgxhjzr,1,t5_2rjxn
