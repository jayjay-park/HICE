Ive heard of some stores doing actual part time employment but the majority of the time youre gunna get .. hours which technically isnt full time since you wont get  hours. Mates work a  hour week. Its a super awesome place to work! Good luck! If you need any advice on applyinginterviews let me know!,tjcrew,co91uzb,1,t5_2xy9h

8807415,0,t3_50fb97,My training was not long at all. So I guess it depends on the store andor captain. They had me shadow different people usually crew members but sometimes merchants for only about  weeks then I was on my own. My first few shifts were only about five hours long just enough to get my feet wet. My first day they had me shadow a crew member. He showed me how to use the zamboni which I havent used since and how to make a bale which Ive done by myself once since. After that we went on register. I have years of register experience so I was fine plus Im pretty good with small talk and not shy. He let me bag for a while first showing me how to create a double bag and giving me tips on how to bag cold stuff together crushables on top etc.. Then after an hour of that he let me jump on register. He taught me how to ring things up and look up stuff on the flip chart techniques on how to pick stuff out of the cart so you wont hurt your wrists how to do the different transactions etc. Its easy stuff.Next day was more of the same but I shadowed a merchant on product. We worked dry pro made a list went to the back. Then we worked deli. She showed me how to keep the deli section in the box tidy organize by date cut down boxes properly when you have gobacks etc.Then it was like that for the next  weeks working different sections. I worked each section at least once. Next thing I know I was turned loose. It was a little scary at first seeing your name on the chart knowing you have to work wet pro or frozen by yourself for the first time no one there you can shadow. But I just asked millions of questions and asked for help if I didnt know something. Its incredible how helpful and patient my fellow coworkers are. But there is only so much they can prepare you for. A lot of things just have to come up. For instance they cant train you on how to do a check transaction until someone writes a check. Theres a ton of things like that. It can be a little frustrating at first. Theres been times where Im like wtf? Ive been here several months now and youre just now training me how to do that?? But thats just how it goes. Its impossible to train you on ever minute detail in the first few weeks especially in our store where were slammed all day our location is one of the busiest and craziest in Southern California. It just has to pop up. Thats why I find myself learning something new every day.Ive been there  months and I still ask questions and get stuck. Its crazy. What happens is I think the schedulers recognize what youre best at so they keep putting you in a section that they think you got down. After a month or so I was put in grocery then was put there almost every day ever since especially for closing. Im a master at closing grocery by now. Then last week seemingly out of nowhere I was scheduled to close meat. I was totally lost even though Ive been there  months. So the closing mate closed meat with me showed me how to do it gave me pointers. A few days later I closed meat by myself no prob.One thing I realized was my wrists hands and back were killing me the first month or so. It was just a bunch of motions my body wasnt used to. So I made sure to stretch a bunch lift properly not overexert myself. Now my body is used to it and Im fine.It also sucks when a customer asks where something is and you have no idea because youre still new. Just run to the nearest crew member theyll bail you out. To prepare for that I just walked up and down all the aisles and try to look at much stuff as I could. Plus I shopped there often after my shift and made sure to buy a few products I never tried. They sometimes let you take stuff home for free if you havent tried it yet. Product knowledge.,tjcrew,d76j5b6,2,t5_2xy9h
