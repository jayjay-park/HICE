5778,0,t3_1u6tf7,After reading the comments I found it funny that the season ticket holders for the Packers need to pay in advance for every postseason home game that might occur.  The money is then held and applied to the following season.  The Bears used to have this policy for season ticket holders but they recently removed it.

18247,0,t1_ceggpym,I will say after some research that given a  confidence level and their noted  . Confidence interval they have selected enough to meet the requirement given the size of the population. Rather the amount they selected afforded them the ability to provide that level of certainty. Though it seems ridiculous that a  Million person population could be summed up in  people. I just dont like that they limit it to certain teams and players even with the option of selecting the other category. I guess Im just confused because I have honestly never met anyone outside of the NFC North that would say that the bears are their most disliked team. I would think this data might be skewed based on the total population of the viewing area of the teams and more importantly the divisions and how they chose to break down their calling strategies to compensate for that. All in all I would love to see the raw data from this and run some analysis of my own to see what types of trends you could see geographically and in other areas that actually apply to football allegiances unlike political stance age race and gender. ,CHIBears,cegie51,2,t5_2s0u3

28990,0,t1_cehocip,First of all Im showing the respect of a legitimate discussion please respond in kind. Secondly isnt that what we did in the first place with Cutler? Meaning traded for the guy who was intended to take over the reigns of the franchise? Now id understand your line of reasoning if our new Head Coach wasnt the offensive playcaller and reason behind a  spot jump within a year of getting into office. Dont get me wrong I think a defense heavy draft is in order and I am not thrilled with Mel Tucker being the DC but weve seen what kind of league this is time and time again when we play the Packers. QBs make or break your team. This isnt to say that I believe Cutler is on par with Rodgers skillwise but top  top   would you disagree? Thirdly I agree with your take on the Cutler treatment to a degree. I think that the guy put up with a lot of shit and needed a good reason to even want this contract from the Bears. That reason was first Brandon Marshall and second Marc Trestman. Do you remember week ? I sure as hell do. You cant honestly tell me that you believe Josh McCown executes the same drive and makes that throw. Maybe you can but then id just laugh at you. Which brings me to Josh. He is awesome and sincerely I hope he comes back next year but you cant argue with the fact that the only legitimate Defense he played against was St. Louis. The first Packer game was awesome but Rodgers didnt get a chance to score a single point. Our Defense almost gave up that game to Eddie Lacy and Seneca Wallace.The tornado game against the defending world champs was Forte carrying the team to a victory after a three hour halftime. If fact if you take a look at Fortes stats youll notice that  of his   carry games come wait for it during McCowns starts! I dont want to look like im shitting on McCown in fact im thoroughly impressed with what an ex high school football coach did for us as a back up QB. I just dont believe that the  year old career back up QB who coached HS football prior to being called back on the pitch is our answer to the QB situation. Finally Jay Cutler and the Packers. Just look at this stats in the final game of the season and bear in mind that the INT came at the last play of the game in the hopes of bailing out our fuckup Defense. For the millionth fucking time people football is a team sport. The Bears cant beat the Packers not Cutler. So if youre blaming him for playing a near perfect game then strap on the pads motherfuckers.,CHIBears,cehqe08,6,t5_2s0u3

36143,0,t3_1udppg,Going into the draft David Bass was my sleeper pick. He had a lot similar to Ansah except he went to a DII school. Every time I watched game tape of him he was making a play and his instincts were phenomenal. The problem was that no one really knew about this explosive monster of an athlete. Honestly Im glad you guys were able to steal him from Oakland.

43500,0,t1_cejdqgk,Im a little confused given that the data I gave that was in the graphs deals with percentages. I went through and charted every QB drafted in every round for  years. I know exactly how many players were drafted in the first round vs. the second round. The numbers reflect the percentage of each rounds QBs that went on to win at least one playoff game.Ill freely admit that the sample size for the middle rounds is smaller than rounds  and two but if those players in the middle rounds were really better players than their first round counterparts theyd be starting for their respective teams and playing toward playoff wins.Also Im not a stats person at all so if theres some weird thing I did here please continue to help try and explain it. Charting data is really more of my wifes thing.,CHIBears,cejdtsb,1,t5_2s0u3

Im not sure what anyone has seen from him that keeps driving this idea.They keep driving the idea because Trest and Emery openly said him switching to LB is a possibility.  Shea has just gotten mauled at DE for two years and showed pretty much no improvement they probably should see what if anything they can get out of him.At best he could provide some competition at LB or maybe come in situationally whenif they run any  sets.  Its not like theyre going to slide in Shea as the starting LB he would have to compete to earn a starting job over them.

805643,0,t1_cgvr15k,Oh I absolutely agree with you! I think we definitely need to keep looking at weapons and a solid slot guy would be good. Wilson and Williams both have potential but like you said they havent proven shit. However theyre still young. I just think if were going to take a shot this year we should look at defense or possibly a QB or RB. I think we really need to take good looks at QBs and other WRs starting next year though. Marshall and Forte are getting older and well need to replace them eventually same with Jay but probably farther down the line. ,CHIBears,cgvut31,1,t5_2s0u3
814927,0,t1_cgwuk4s,True but Jeffrey was a second round pick whilst Conte was a third. Neither were first round picks much like the majority of our current starting offense Cutler  th st round pick in  Forte  th pick nd round in  Marshall  th pick th round in  Jeffrey  th pick nd round in  Wilson  th pick th round in  Bennett  st pick nd round in  Bushrod  th pick th round in  Slauson  rd pick th round in  Garza  th pick th round in  Long  th pick st round in  Mills  rd pick th round in In summary Round    Round    Round    Round    Round    Round    Round    We have more starters on our offense drafted in round  or later than we do in the first three round. Now Im not saying that the best players in ever draft are found after round  but there is quality players to be found. And with the picks easier to obtain and the success weve had finding talent in later rounds Id personally rather have more later round picks on the chance you hit on a Brandon Marshall or Jordan Mills than run the risk of using a first round pick on a Chris Williams Gabe Carimi or Shea McClellin. I completely understand why people would be oppose to the idea its certainly wacky. TLDR My suggestion as unrealistic as it may sound is that even if you miss on  of your draft picks youll still find yourself left with  dimes.EDIT I put in some bold.,CHIBears,cgwwso6,1,t5_2s0u3

818590,0,t3_23hi6m,I definitely wouldnt mind adding another linebacker to the mix. My inner pessimistic Bears fan is emerging from the kool aid. McClellin is teetering on bust status and a switch to linebacker is obvious but should have happened his rookie year. Doing it now is just conceding they made an error. He needs to prove he isnt a bust at this point and although I think he has the tools to be successful he still has to prove it on the field which he hasnt yet. Greene and Bostic I like but neither of them have exactly proven anything either. Personally I chalk that up to the horrific defense around them this year because as rookies IMO theyre the least responsible ones on the field. I have high hopes for both of them but thats only two guys and you always have to account for the unexpected injuries etc.. Briggs is a Chicago legend but we need to accept that his time in Chicago is coming to an end.  ,CHIBears,cgxbr9u,0,t5_2s0u3

953827,0,t1_chcpd1g,Agreed.  There is just something in my gut telling me its going to be Fuller even if Pryor and Dix are there.  He just seems like an Emery kind of guy.  Super athletic long has the measurables and extremely versatile.  Hes faster quicker has longer arms a higher vertical and longer broad jump bigger hands than either Pryor or Dix.  Only about  shorter than Dix but like I said longer arms and much higher vertical jump.Fuller is great in coverage.  He does great in Zone and offman coverage.  The biggest knock on him as a coverage cornerback is he isnt the best in pressbump man to man.  Which as a Free Safety in coverage or as a nickleextra defender that is the coverage that he would be expected to play the least.

1380443,0,t1_cipa7i5,Schemes is plural not possessive. It is hard to tell with Tucker. But it is easy to see a defense that was at one point playing two street free agents at DT a pretty essential position two rookies at LB and was without Pro Bowl corner Tillman. No defense is going to look good under those conditions. This year will tell us a lot. I dont think its fair to say the Bears look better than the Packers at this point but its also unfair to say the Bears couldnt pass them up. The Pack has drafted fairly lackluster the past few years which is particularly concerning for a team with scant interest in free agency. The Bears set a lot of attention to fixing the offense and did. Now they are focused on the defense. If the new guys they brought in pan out who knows. Its football. Any given Sunday anything can happen. ,CHIBears,cipbn4p,1,t5_2s0u3

1816877,0,t3_2fdade,gtCOACH OF THE YEARgtBrian Billick Marc Trestman Chicago Bears. Had it not been for the recordsetting  Denver Broncos the Bears would have had the leagues highestscoring offense. With an improved defense Chicago is my pick to win the NFC North and make it to the conference title game.Also Adam SheingtAdam Schein Trestman. I think the Bears are a playoff team and the secondyear coaching guru guides them there. They play in a tough division and conference so this will be a big accomplishment.

If we start to stunt then we end up fucking ourselves over and easily lose contain. People seem to think that we HAVE to run some type of complicated defence with stunts and zone blitzes and blah blah but we dont have to do that against a pretty basic offence. We did pretty good at keeping contain all game barely any big runs over  happened outside the C gaps. What we lacked is in the interior. We werent able to hold our own and our linebackers werent able to make any plays or fill their gaps. We see more complicated offences in high school football. ,CHIBears,ckdkfpg,3,t5_2s0u3

2014004,0,t1_ckvs7wv,I think he already has improved. He is much more conscious of his role on the team than he was prior to Trestman. He is more cautious about throwing the ball. He has good command of the line of scrimmage. He has shown he can adjust to pressure in the pocket. Hes even better at taking hits. Notice the way he falls when he does get sacked. Hes doing his best to avoid injury. He has become more of a leader.I think Cutler is a little neurotic though. He needs to feel good about the direction of the game and the performances of his teammates. He needs to be secure in the defense so he doesnt have to force throws. Trestman is doing his best to meet all of these conditions. And why? Because elite QBs are rare. Cutler is the best we have had and the best were going to have for a long time. ,CHIBears,ckvvuan,2,t5_2s0u3

2077415,0,t3_2io0cb,Both sides are lousy for different reasons. When the defensive players do amazing things the D performs well. The interceptions and the sacks have been momentum changers. But how many times have you heard ...to a wide open... when anyone catches a pass. It seems every play the announcers are saying that. The Bills with a lousy QB the Jets with a lousy QB Carolina with a hurt QB and San Francisco with a mistake prone offense penalties all had great games against the Bears. Lets not talk about Aaron Rogers. The D as a team and the defensive coach have been awful. If not for a couple of individuals this D would be as bad as last year. Time will tell.The offense is the exact opposite. As a team they do well. When they work together and all perform well together they cannot be stopped. However due to mistakes by individuals Cutler for the most part they have lost momentum. A missed field goal a bad interception a ball pushed up in the air when not catching it false starts at the wrong time. It was individuals who have cost us points.So without individuals the D is horrible. With individuals the offense is horrible.

The coach should manage the game.  I think Trestman is a bit delusional to be honest.  Stop calling  yard routes so much.  Rodgers rarely throws the ball down field the way Cutler does.  He can be a game manager if the play calling forces him to.I think his contract in hindsight might be a bit pricey but its front loaded and in line with guys like Stafford and Flacco which I think hes in the same class as.  ,CHIBears,clfqwt0,1,t5_2s0u3
2171353,0,t1_clfp20o,I think its pretty simple with Jay and hes been this way since hes been here. If the OC calls a one dimensional game and puts it all on him hes eventually going to make a mistake. If the OC calls a relatively balanced game Jay is going to succeed.Ive had fans argue with me on here the short passing game is just as effective as the run game. Maybe that was true up until about  years ago but now you have faster linebackers out there covering from sideline to sideline.  defenses which are prevalent in the NFL are designed to contain outside plays. Running the ball keeps the defense honest and allows the OLine to beat on the DLine. Im not a fan of Trestman game planning to give up on the run before the game even starts. He should know Jay isnt that guy game plan and call the game accordingly.,CHIBears,clftw9m,3,t5_2s0u3

Maybe hes a great coach whos just had some bum luck on the other hand he might be a terrible coach with the great luck of landing an NFL gig. Oh and I have to call you on that nonsense about coaches refusing to take the Bears job because firing Mel Tucker would make it seem too unstable or...something.  No. This is a coveted job they get paid well and once youre in the coordinator clubas youre proving no matter how bad you are at your job some people will make excuses for you. And where you do mess up you get to play musical chairs and make a lateral move to another club. ....I mentioned this in another post but I just have to reiterate there are sooooo many talented people out there wanting to move up the ranks there are likely s if not s of coaches whod do a better job than Tucker who will never even get the chance to interview for an NFL job.

2337734,0,t3_2m3cmd,Selective data can be deceptively misleading.  Let me point out a couple thoughts Skewed completion data.  Jay Cutler currently has a  completion percentage the highest in his  year NFL career.  Why?  Same reason of the PFF stats you see above which is due to lots of little checkdown passes to Forte over the middle while MarshallJeffrey are less involved and there are less big plays.Ben Roethlisberger . yrdsg Drew Brees . yrdsg Jay Cutler . yrdsg.  Again little passes to Forte skews the completion percentage higher but takes his yards per throw down.  Is that kind of passing game putting points on the board and winning football games?  No.  Of course not. No penalty for turnovers particularly fumbles.  We know Jay leads the league in turnovers.  If you have a high completion percentage but then give the ball away what good is that?  Those mistakes which often happen under pressure arent penalized in this data really.  The way this data is sorted it more or less implicitly assumes that all these QBs turnover the ball at the same rate.

2365511,0,t3_2megbc,I think it first starts with respect. If players like Briggs or Marshall respected Trestman they wouldnt be saying what theyve been saying to the media. Or asking to go open a restaurant the week before the first game of the season or telling the media you want to fight a fan. I think Trestmans I dont want to to offend anyone approach can work if you have the leaders in the locker room. If say a Peyton Manning or Matt Ryan type was in the locker room.The Bears dont have that. Cutler isnt a vocal leader. Marshall is just insane. Briggs was only a leader by play he always had Urlacher and Mike Brown being the true leaders of that defense. Briggs with how he conducts himself off the field would never also be taken seriously as a leader Lambo accident likes to party a lot.   So you have no true locker room leaders combined with a coach that wont discipline anyone and you just have a mess. Im guessing his CFL teams had some leaders in the locker room. Also the the whole thing is different due to the money involved. The average CFL salary is  which is lower than what a practice squad player makes . The minimum NFL salary is . Not familiar with the CFL either but guaranteed money has to be a lot lower as well. Im guessing the typical CFL player doesnt want to piss off his coach or team. There are less CFL teams so you have less chance of a team taking a chance on you if you are known as a locker room problem and you probably cant afford any stoppage in pay checks. Where in the NFL you have Marshall who has millions in guaranteed money still coming his way even if the Bears release him after this season. He doesnt have much finical incentive to tone it down.Lastly its also about winning. If the Bears had a few bounces go their way against Buffalo and Carolina and were  these thing wouldnt be as big of an issue. But since the Bears are  and almost certainly not making the playoffs these issues get magnified. ,CHIBears,cm434aa,2,t5_2s0u3

Then he wants  in the league money and wants a lot more guaranteed. And the media will crucify you if you dont give it to him. His current contract has a lot of unguarenteed moneyespecially after year . So you think ill outsmart them all by franchising him..  Thats a pretty wishful scenario.  Almost absurd..  Jay Cutler was never going to leave his current situation for a dump of a team like Washington Redskins simply for more money.  The Bears rebuilt the entire team around Jay bringing people like Brandon Marshall and Marc Trestman.  At some point its not about money its about where you want to have your career and be productive.  Its about the people you want to work with every year.  Who is going to go to the Redskins for a few extra dollars when the entire teamorganization has given you what you want in Chicago and you are putting up  wl numbers?  It defies all rational logic to leave that situation at that point in your career and say Ill just start all over rebuilding because I can get a little bit more money..  The extra money he would have gotten wouldnt of been much more than what the Bears already gave him.  Even with one good season under his belt hes not going to get more than Aaron Rodgers or Tom Brady.  The difference between their salaries and Cutlers current salary isnt much.

2595545,0,t3_2ph9bc,I think Emery got thrown into a a situation where he had to deal with the a situation that wasnt the best. He built the offense up and has made some good picks Long Jeffery Fuller Ego and Sutton. He made key signings that I think benefited an aging D. He also didnt cave to Urlacher. No offense to Brian but what he wanted was outta the question for a guy as old as he was. Emery I think deserves a second shot at getting his man at Head Coach. There arent a lot of sexy names in the HC market right now. Harbaugh? Michigan is going to throw everything plus the library at him. Beyond him there isnt a name out there that can make a big splash. I think a top  pick gives him wiggle room. It wouldnt be the worst thing in the world to take another DB or LB in that slot and see what QBs are left in the second. Im thinking Huntley from UCLA would benefit greatly from a year watching and learning the new system. I hate to say but Jay is a lame duck QB now. Unless he turns into GOOD Jay for  weeks Meaning a good playoff showing hes off the Bears roster. Maybe we could convince the new Davis in Oakland to trade us Carr. Either way I dont think next year will be a rebuild and reset year. Ninja Edit I also think Emery has to deal with possibly one of the  worst ownership groups in the McCaskeys and their President Phillips.

Their GMs draft depth when injuries happen the next man steps up and actually plays some decent football. We have starters that are not even playing decent football on that defense. How can you sit here and even claim guys like Bostic Washington etc. have done anything decent for this team when our defense is dead last in the NFL. If his drafting got so much better he drafted  defensive players with the first  rounds this year and yet our defense dropped from last season to the WORST in the NFL..LOL clown.Dude Jordan Mills had a terrible year and how many times was he benched? Bostic has done zilch and dont forget about McClellin..A st round pick who Emery has clearly failed to admit his mistake and decides to keep him around on the field still.It isnt about sacks and I know a lot more than you think. Lamar Houston had what  tackle in  games? He was doing nothing on the field and Jared Allen was doing squat either before he got sick. What games were you watching if you think they were providing to be impressive? Emery let Julius Peppers walk and look at how much he has been revived in GB. Also Jared Allen is only making  million this year but guess what his contract shoots up to . million guaranteed next season the second highest player on the team behind Cutler so is that worth it? He has looked weak this year and next year he will only be another year older.For the last part your saying as Cutler seems to have trade value. After his last performance against the nd worst pass defense in the NFL Saints who the hell would trade anything for Jay Cutler especially when his contract is that much? We would be lucky to get a nd round pick for him and if somebody was actually stupid enough to toss us a nd round pick Emery or whoever the next GM is wont hesitate for one second. ,CHIBears,cmynx4o,0,t5_2s0u3

More than likely they play w him for one more year because they are rebuilding anyway.   is virtually lost season anyways.We are two steps behind the Vikings in our rebuild.

2760256,0,t3_2rjonb,Both. Im skeptical of being playoff contenders but only because our division is now so strong. If we were NFC South Id be more optimistic that we could make it next  seasons.Obviously a head coach with some fire and discipline is needed because identity and drive seemed to be an issue. A normal captain system not a rotating title. And a stronger Coordinator staff handpicked by the HC so its not a cobbled together affair like we had with Trestman and Emery. We need a GM who knows how to scout and draft. And mostly whoever fills these vacant coaching positions needs to be able to handle adversity and be flexible enough to make changes. The worst part of this season was it felt like nothing changed even when something clearly wasnt working definition of insanity yadda yadda. Try something new and fail until something works.Our roster is old but fairly talented. We need to use the aging guys as effectively as possible now and also plow ahead developing younger upandcomers to be the next wave. Im a fan of emphasizing the latter when it matters less garbage time so they have some rotation that isnt purely due to injuries. But the coach needs to say that if a veteran isnt performing hes out. No rewarding middling performance.Offense QB is a wild card but Im assuming Cutler stays at least next season due to cap space. But stop trying to fix him. Work around his limitations dont try to make him the cornerstone. Build a new offense that isnt QB focused  so he can win us games when hes Smokin Jay but cant lose them when he blunders. Cutlers not a precision QB enough to pull off West Coast offense so move away from that. And make him fight for the job with a developing QB. His feet should be to the fire.We need a speedy WR with good hands. Marshall and Jeffrey are strong and big but not fast. Especially when theyre injured...they were far too easy to cover this season. Utilize Bennett more and pick up another tight end with good hands.Hopefully Carey develops into a stronger RB develop him to replace Forte in a couple years. Maybe we pick up a power RB who can plow through some linemen for all of Fortes awesomeness he cant run straight into the line and motor for  yards. The line could be shored up but its functional.Defense Still our main weakness. Especially the secondary. Fuller is a potential bright spot...otherwise Im failing here. We need safeties and linebackers bad. I would look to the Ravens as a model for building a functional secondary. Theyve been decimated by injuries this season but still managed great performance.  Dont slot a guy into a set gameplan just because hes all you have change the gameplan depending on who you have.Ultimately I think the Bears lacked flexibility when it came to gameplanning so when things started falling apart Trestman and Co. didnt know what to do.,CHIBears,cnhtwk4,1,t5_2s0u3

Fangio and Fox are not shy about drafting pass rushers in the first round especially when its their first draft with a new team i.e. Fox drafted Julius Peppers with the Panthers and Von Miller with Denver Fangio was there when ers drafted Aldon Smith. I think second and third rounds they draft a safety and an olineman.I also think they draft a running back before round  though.

Pernell McPhee now that Houston has been tagged is probably going to get    million from a team desperate for a pass rush. Run stuffing NTs are valued far less Knighton is probably only going to cost  million and I think hell be better than Shelton to boot. When youre drafting in the top  an elite edge rusher is one of the best picks you can make especially considering this years draft.

Because either of us can prove we know how Fangio will run his defense. On the contrary I am completely open to the fact that Houston could be the starting SB in the base defense. My entire point was centered around trying to infer why maybe that is not such a certainty. You on the other hand are insisting Fangio will use his linebackers in a very predefined very static way. I think that is crazy to assume. Not to mention limiting and counterintuitive to a  defense if you dont mix up responsibilities  of a OLB.I still dont know what you are trying to prove with your argument about contain. If your responsibility is contain you cannot let the RB get outside you. If the RB bounces it is still your responsibility. And Houston doesnt have the speed to prevent a RB from racing to the sideline to and turning up field. It is not the safeties job to account for this liability. He is  lbs heavier than Brooks is he is much better suited to be in the trenches. Doesnt mean he cant play OLB.

Carden could be put on the practice squad if Fales gets it. I wouldnt be surprised if Carey gets cut. No more than  RBs will be rostered also. Bennett is the only sure bet at TE so theres  guys brought in to find the bast talent through competition. The number of TEs to be rostered really depends on how much the team likes the dudes and how clear it is when cuts happen. If they dont like anybody  TEs could happen. If there is a close competition and significant special teams contribution I could see  rostered. ,CHIBears,crb3cih,5,t5_2s0u3

Or is it none of the above because hes referencing something new that isnt even on twitter?  God forbid I ask for some clarity.,CHIBears,ctupqml,-7,t5_2s0u3

4817682,0,t3_3guphb,The front  on defence.  Hate to say it but it may very well be our weakest point.  Ratliff was once an all pro nose but he hasnt played there in a while and is getting old.  Jenkins is serviceable but is by no means a great player and anybody else up front is a rookie or is their first year playing in a  pro defense.  DE will be one of the first positions targeted in next years draft I believe unless Ego or Sutton show us they can ball.  Goldman should win the nose eventually but as of right now is unproven. ,CHIBears,cu1t3wi,3,t5_2s0u3

Its pretty obvious that Matthews was assigned to cover Bennett and they had him on that side to disguise their coverage which is what led to the pick along with a great play from Matthews.Definitely not disagreeing that they may have had an idea of what we were doing based on research or an earlier use of the play but I just dont see the defense all glaring at Bennett or doing anything abnormal.

Were going to end up with a lot of stuffed runs  and outs and failed screen passes.I honestly expected more out of this coaching staff and front office than to give us the AngeloSmithEmeryTrestman treatment.

5182959,0,t1_cvaoqc2,Well the rate at which he turns it over is worse than these guys.  Brees attempted  more passes Luck attempted  more and nearly doubled Jays rushing attempts and Rivers attempted  more and nearly matched Jays rushing attempts.  And talentwise on the offensive side the Bears probably had the most of these teams. This offense looked good with Jay before he got hurt now imagine Brees or Luck as rough as he has looked this season in there.  Im not saying Jay is shit or anything but that would probably raise this offense from good to fantastic.  ,CHIBears,cvaqiqx,1,t5_2s0u3

But I dont believe he has lived up to what we traded for him.  He throws some picks at the worst times.  I just dont understand the argument that he is the best we have had  That is settling and not something I ever plan on doing as a Bears fan.  Just because we havent had an elite QB since way back when doesnt mean we shouldnt still always be looking for one.  I think the best thing for both parties would be Cutler to play well this year and trade him to a team like the Texans who could use him.  We get draft picks to help our terrible team since we arent winning in the next two years and he gets to go prove he can contend.,CHIBears,cvc2lpr,1,t5_2s0u3

Just imagine how Jimmy feels knowing he contributed to the loss even though it wasnt entirely his fault. His teammates are forgiving yet upset at themselves for letting the team down. The coaches are blaming themselves but they all believe they can learn from this experience and win in the future.While all of this is going on there are fans such as yourself who put players down negatively. The amount of hate expressed in that game solely to Jimmy is the reason why these players and the entire team as a whole are each others family. When the going is rough they all believe they can fix their rough patch. Any outside hate they consume but they try not to let it weaken them mentally.When the Bears start becoming successful again and the hate towards certain players starts to seize this organization will acknowledge the majority of fans who stuck with the team and gave inspiration to the players to never give up and encouraged them to always improve.

Matt Fortes conversion rate is ..  That is less so he looks below average.  But wait!  I am claiming that what has been below average in Chicago is our offensive line.  A little evidence for thisForte owns the best conversion rate weve had here since  even better than the short yardage specialists weve occasionally brought in such as Michael Bush . in his career but only . with the Bears.Marshawn Lynchs conversion rate with the Seahawks has been ..  Better than Forte but also below NFL average even though Lynch is known as a powerful runner.  But heres my point  when he played for Buffalo Marshawn Lynchs conversion rate was  exactly.  Did he suddenly figure out how to get short yardage or did he come into a better team?There are guys who are really good at short yardage situations.  Adrian Peterson converts at a  clip.  DeMarco Murray is running at  in his young career.  Matt Forte is definitely not as good as these guys in short yardage situations and Im not saying that the running back has nothing to do with it.  But put those guys behind some of the train wrecks weve forced Forte to rely on and I bet those numbers plummet.I thought Jacquizz Rodgers seemed gifted at turning  yard losses into  yard gains.  I might have chosen him in short yardage before he got hurt.  With whats left on the roster though Id stick with Matt.,CHIBears,cvxb8gf,3,t5_2s0u3

5427460,0,t3_3pdkln,I havent been a big Cutler supporter in the past last year I started fading on the guy but I have to admit hes been pretty damn consistent this year in a good way. The stats may not bear it yesterday but I thought he was a much better QB than Stafford. If you look at their picks... Cutlers was on a fade in the corner of the endzone to Jeffrey who if he turned a bit sooner to comeback for the ball would have overpowered the CB for the TD reception or at least knocked it away... possibly drawn a PI call. Staffords was just a terrible decision at a terrible time. Cutler may not have had  TDs but he made big plays to set us up for them on the ground. And hes been clutch on rd down and in the th quarter. I wouldnt be upset if we drafted an understudyeventual replacement for him... but Ill give him the props he earned. Good job Cutty.,CHIBears,cw5eww8,2,t5_2s0u3

5720296,0,t1_cx64vti,Sounds good on the surface but is actually not a good idea and would never happen.The give Gase huge dollars is fine.  But that alone might not keep him.  You start promising future HC Jobs you have any number of problems.  First you alienate your current coach by telling him that he has no shot at extending his contract even though its  years from now no matter how well he might do.  What happens if the Bears win the SuperBowl?  You still want to shove Fox out the door even if he wants to keep working?Also Gase wouldnt agree to it unless Fox comes out and says he is planning on retiring.  Out of respect he wouldnt push Fox out the door.  Kind of like Arians said that he would have never taken the HC Job in Indianapolis even if it was offered to him out of respect to Pagano.  Not to mention you do that once what kind of coach is going to want to come work for your team if they think you could be hiring their replacement years before their contract is even up?,CHIBears,cx65qj6,9,t5_2s0u3

6223491,0,t3_40swdl,A PSL is a personal seat license that can cost anywhere from a little over a thousand per seat to over  per seat depending on where it is located. I believe the PSL marketplace opens next week. You pay a current PSL holder who no longer wishes to buy tickets for the right to buy tickets for that seats for Bears games and possibly other events at Soldier Field if your ticket is in the club level. If you do not buy season tickets for your seats includes all preseason season and postseason your account closes and you receive no refund. You can transfer your individual game tickets or sell them on a secondary market but you are responsible for the ticketholder unless you sell them on the NFLs ticket exchange site. Meaning if you sell them to someone on stubhub or some other site and they act like an idiot and get kicked out you could possibly be in trouble and even lose your tickets.For season tickets you must put a deposit I believe it is still  per seat that will later apply to your seats when you get to the top of the waiting list. So essentially buying a PSL allows you to bypass the waiting list which is pretty long. If it works out for you you should be able to sell or transfer your PSL when you no longer wish to buy tickets ideally for more than you paid. Its basically a security deposit. The waiting list for season tickets moves pretty slow. Here is my spot for the last  seasons            Hope that helps.,CHIBears,cyx1ko2,2,t5_2s0u3

You are free to sell them like any other game if you didnt want to attend though.Im pretty sure Ticket Exchange doesnt do anything to secure your PSLs in this type of situation. I think what they are describing is basically a fan protect guarantee like Stub Hub does. Meaning the buyer cant get boned with duplicate tickets from a seller. NFL Ticket Exchange is just Ticketmasters way to be the official reseller of NFL tickets. Just know if you sell your tickets on the secondary market you run the risk of some idiot getting in trouble at the game in your seats. No matter where they were purchased. Id say thats probably rare but its a risk if you sell to unknowns.  ,CHIBears,cyz980q,2,t5_2s0u3

6249822,0,t3_416l7x,I think if youre going to give up a draft pick to get a quarterback from another team to be your backup might as well just use one in April to pick one. Plus we really dont know what Fales or Blanchard can do in a real game yet but if they dont pick up a quarterback well get a better feel come next August.To me McCarron isnt better than Jay Cutler. If he was he wouldnt be a back up for the Bengals hed be a starter somewhere because teams have traded for him. McCarron may be better than Fales but the two Bears organizations have jumped through hoops to keep Fales so clearly theres something to him. And Blanchard is just really the third camp arm and why trade for that?Id say trading for any quarterback at this point is the wrong move. If they need a backup draft or sign him. If theyre convinced they need a new starter they should draft best available QB at  and pray hard. But Id roll with Jay Fales and Blanchard into next August and see what happens.,CHIBears,cz01cxt,19,t5_2s0u3

Then well see Cutler have a real shot at winning the Super Bowl. I expect the Bears to win a playoff game next year.,CHIBears,czxu9n3,1,t5_2s0u3
6566633,0,t1_czxr577,I dont think its premature. Signing Forte would have been risky. Hes at the age where even the great RBs start to decline and it looks like hes lost some burst whether that was temporarily due to injury or more serious we wont know for sure. Considering we didnt even give him a deal it looks like he wasnt going to go as low as we wanted. Its sad to have him but I think its a necessary move. If were going to continue our strategy of building through the draft and making reasonable moves in free agency his contract can be costly. You mention the possibility of trading him but if he declines then well lose a lot of trade value and teams wouldnt want his contract. Looks like Pace and Fox think that Langford and Carey can make up most of Fortes production so it wouldnt be smart to pay Forte on top of that for a little bit of extra production.,CHIBears,czyjlr7,1,t5_2s0u3

As crazy as it sounds I think hes been more lucky than good the last year and our front seven is going to be ridiculous.What I am worried about is our offense. We have a lot of question marks along the offensive line we lost our most versatile weapon in Matt Forte we are very thin at TE and the assumption that Loggains will be as good of a play caller as Gase is a based on speculation at this point. If our games against the Packers come down to the team that can make two big plays that could be difficult for us.We can sweep them... but it is no slam dunk and perfectly possible that were going to get swept. If there is an OL combination that can protect Cutler and Kevin White gives us that oomph opposite of Alshon then Ill feel much better of our chances.

8777996,0,t3_5032f8,A college student yet  month ago you posted thisHi Reddit please help me out. I am  years old and make about K per year. I am a diehard sports fan and want to attend a game at every professional sports venue for the  major sports  teams as well as a bunch of other venuesevents. This has been my dream since I was a little child. Ill admit this is not a cheap hobby so my first two years after I graduated I lived with my parents to save money. At present day I have K in my K which I think is real good and about K liquid. My only debt is about K left on my car which will be paid off this November. I was originally pursuing this dream with an ex girlfriend of about  years. I sadly asked her to marry me and she said no and basically broke my heart. This was about a year ago now. I am over it but still want to attend all these games and complete my dream. Is it foolish to basically just maintain my liquid savings for  years and not grow them so I can complete this dream? I would continue to add  of each paycheck to my K each month so that grows and I wouldnt go into debt. The worst I envision happening is my liquid savings going down by a few thousand but my goal is to maintain it at around K. I am not looking to buy a house in the near future and my car is a  model bought it new therefore I dont envision any large purchases in the near future. I just want to make sure Im not going after my dream in a dumb way. Thank you for all the help!,CHIBears,d72x2jw,1,t5_2s0u3

Some of the evidence may have been objectionable I get that but the entire point of opinions like his should be to generate discussion.

Theres a difference between HURR DURR CUTLER SUCKS and Cutler isnt the QB we need him to be to advance as a team followed by organized evidence to back up your points.

Not like Foxs ultra conservative lets play to lose style is any better. Emery drafted all pros signed star FA and didnt fucking get rid of top tier talent for how they spent their off day.Theres a reason why were at the bottom of every power ranking theres a reason why were the only NFC north team who failed to win today.

Jeremy Langford and Jordan Howard may end up being a solid onetwo punch in the backfield but thats about it outside of Alshon.   That means if Pace fails to sign him hell have to look to free agency and this free agent wide receiver class looks bleak or spend another first or second round pick on a wide receiver.

9039716,0,t1_d7yecpm,Floyd is a project but has shown flashed of what exactly he can do. He did get a sack in his first NFL game but does need to learn how to properly attack more which will come with time. Also the Floyd pick had roots in the Mcphee injury issue. While some believed Mcphee was damaged goods Pace acquired elite talent for  under market value while weighing the risk to reward. If he comes back  and doesnt continue to have the same injury issues it will be one of if not the best acquisitions in .As for white I believe the issue with reintegrating him into football after a year off totally lies on the coaching staffs shoulders. It took loggains  games and all of the off season to realize he was going about it in a bad way. White doesnt have a fully developed route tree or the best understanding of different types of coverages while he does have insane athletism. White will be a stud if the coaching staff doesnt ruin him by trying to have him do too much right off the bat. Let him developed a feel for coverages doing basic routes before giving him option routes.As for the FoxPace power struggle I believe it is a product of a coach that has been around as long as fox paired with a first time GM trying to find his way. If the guy that was decided on to be a head coach by more than just pace stops using players that pace acquired because they arent his guys you need to give it a chance instead of risking total ruin. Then if things arent going well for fox pace should step in and force fox to play guys whether or not they are foxs guys saying fox had his chance and its clearly not working I can see that happening this season. If fox still resists then pace needs to bring up the idea of firing fox because he would be completely upsetting the power balance. You cant just immediately create a complete conflict between coaches and the GM because that can spiral out of control very fast. Let fox dig his own grave being stubborn then try to intervene and if fox still wont comply this is when you know the issue is with the coach.,CHIBears,d7yfhx7,-1,t5_2s0u3

9079219,0,t1_d835ga9,gtThe Brandon Marshall trade was a bad trade considering the Dolphins were going to release him anyway. They gave up two draft picks for a player they could have signed as a FA.This is purely speculation and in large part because of Jeff Ireland trying to save his ass after the entire Dolphin fanbase wanted his head afterwards.gtLets not forget that Emerys first OC hire was Mike Tice a guy who has never coordinated an offense before or since.That was a Lovie hire.  Lovie was responsible for all coordinator hires.gtEmery was worse than Angelo. If for nothing else than his coaching hire.Emery got us in one year a solid offense what Angelo couldnt in over ten.  To say he was objectively worse is extremely shortsighted.  Angelo was one of the worst GMs in the league.

In that case Long will stay at RG.Ultimately it comes down to which of Long Leno and a rookie plays RT best.This is assuming of course that moving Long from RG doesnt ruin a solid interior line.,CHIBears,d8e2a3x,5,t5_2s0u3

Grasu is down for the season Cutlers been out for most of it McPhee thankfully he is back and Fuller. A lot of major pieces are out. While I dont want to say Injuries are the only reason we are  it certainly plays a huge factor. Pace has shown that he can get talent in both FA and Draft. Jordan Howard has been a stud. Sutton Trevathan and McPhee have been good signings under good contracts.

9529765,0,t1_d9nq646,Spielman is receiving some backlash for not being more attentive to the oline over the past few seasons but there were a lot of circumstances beyond his control that led to it being in the current deplorable state that its in. First Phil Loadholt who was one of the best RTs in the league tore his Achilles tendon in the  preseason suffered a setback in rehab and had to retire as a result.  Despite that Spielman had signed Andre Smith to shore up that spot. Smith played poorly however then had a season ending injury on top of it all. Spielman also signed Alex Boone this offseason to start at Left Guard so Brandon Fusco could move back to Right Guard where he had played well. Boone has been decent but Fusco is struggling despite being back at his natural position. Spielman drafted TJ Clemmings in the th round in  and it was seen as a good pick at the time but after Loadholts injury Clemmings was forced to start as a rookie and wasnt anywhere close to being ready. Hes still awful this year too which makes me question if hell ever even be competent. Then of course theres Matt Kalil who hasnt been good since his rookie year going down with a season ending hip injury and forcing the Vikings to sign an ultra rusty Jake Long. The Vikes even shook up their coaching staff by firing our offensive line coach after  whose name escapes me and hiring Tony Sparano.Really the only egregiously bad thing Spielman has done in my mind at least is drafting Willie Beavers in the th round. Beavers was ranked as one of the worst offensive lineman in the entire draft and he didnt even make the active roster. When a th round pick can barely make the practice squad you know things are bad. It was a total head scratching pick at the time and with hindsight its even worse.tldr Spielman and the Vikings FO did make a serious effort to shore up the oline but everything that could go wrong did and now were paying the price,CHIBears,d9nqt45,7,t5_2s0u3

A couple of other teams have more injuries.  Plenty have similar numbers.  Teams who are low arent low every year and teams who are high arent high every year.  Its mostly chance.  There is no exercise that would have helped Zach Miller on his injury.  If you get rolled up and your leg gets trapped it doesnt matter how strong and conditioned you are the joint is being bent in a way it wasnt meant to bend and somethings going to tear.If the Bears had guys tearing muscles without contact and pulling things all the time Id say you had a point.

And did that with shitall help from the rest of our secondary. Dont shit on a good player because you dont like that the last gm picked trestman.Pace has gutted this team of talent for day  draft picks and none of his replacements are of equal talent to what he got rid of. Alshon would be a moron to sign a long term deal with this organization unless we overpay. And were looking to be heading back to the QB carsol we were from McMahon to Cutler all over again. Our OC walked and is doing a phenomenal job with the Dolphins. While fox is being outscored massively in the second half Gase is outscoring teams massively in his. Now weve got rumbling of losing our DC as well. And our current OC is too damn stupid to feed Howard the ball and still hasnt learned that Howard isnt forte and wont be the backfield receiver that Forte was.The reason injuries have destroyed this team is because were getting rid of starters for next to nothing in return.

Id like to see Howard used more in the red zone and on rd down but just using him more in itself is not going to win games and hes only one part of the offense. The fact is that even with that struggling QB and weak receiving corps Loggains has managed to move the offense down the field. Were still above league average in yardage which we have no right to be considering how beat up our offense is. Obviously points win games not yards but even the sainted Adam Gase only managed to get  more points a game on average in . Considering he had a much healthier offense are those  points really the difference between a great OC and a terrible one who deserves to be fired?Theres also the fact that Loggains is obviously a QBs guy who managed to get backups to exceed expectations.

10259914,0,t1_dc6tsws,My source is  look at them.Theyre all deeply flawed.  Theres not one QB who youd say is ready to start with minimal preparation.  Thats what a top  pick looks like.  Nobody thought Andrew Luck needed a year.  He started his first game to absolutely nobodys surprise.  Thats a top  pick.Mahomes?  Right now his mechanics are a mess.  Not only is he not ready to start he needs to improve basic fundamentals at the position.  Hes still exciting to watch and Im not saying he wont be able to start in the league.  He might well be able to.  But day one?  That seems unlikely.Kaaya has good fundamentals but it all breaks down when he feels pressure.  Again that might be fixable and he might end up just fine.  But hes not ready for NFL defenses on day one.You can go through all of them like that.  They could all make strides.  You could also end up with a Bortles situation where theyre not top  but someone reaches for them anyway.

10406997,0,t1_dcnfbnt,Yeah sorry I didnt explain my thoughts very well. Youre definitely correct about that being the cap space we have but those numbers alone are very tough to draw implications from. What these numbers turn out to be in the offseason and how much buying power a team has in free agency are determined by a lot more factors.For instance you have to take into account probable salary cap casualties players on their own team whos contracts are expiring especially those coming off rookie deals an ability to restructure many large capoccupying contracts like McPhee on our team or even Cutler and lastly theres tons of adjustments penalties carryover amp contract clauses etc that come into play as the offseason officially begins. Just quickly looking over the contract situations of the teams that currently have more cap space than us the only teams that could potentially cut their way to having more spending power than us are the Browns in st with  mil and the ers in nd with  mil with the Bears being in rd with potentially  million in space depending on some decisions funny how it turns out to be the draft order too. Just as a side note I was convinced we would be able to get Eric Berry but after going through the Chiefs contract situations they have way more money than I thought get  million just from cutting Foles amp Jamaal Charles. ,CHIBears,dcnp8nc,2,t5_2s0u3

Hes interesting in that many of his short to mid throws look like they lack zip but he manages to throw some pretty bombs.In college hes always looked like a game manager to me. Ive never seen him be the star of his team. Your average college football fan that happened to tune into an Iowa game never ever came away from the game wondering who that QB from Iowa was.I want to be drafting a QB that was a star on their team. Even then I know the odds of them being even an average starter in the NFL are low.I always use Kyle Orton as a good measuring stick. His best college season was . .Beathards best season was . .Now I know Beathard was asked to do far less in the Iowa offense compared to Ortons role in the Purdue attack but he just has no wow factor attached to him.Orton tore up the Big  and was an average NFL QB at best. Beathard looks to be  tiers below Orton as a college QB. That doesnt even project out to be an NFL backup for me.His size and deep throws are enough for me to pay attention to him. Ive been underwhelmed in every game Ive seen him play in.Ill watch the Senior Bowl and give all those players the benefit of the doubt but I would be very surprised if I come away impressed with Beathard.,CHIBears,dcsbcqp,3,t5_2s0u3

The coaching staff just needs to use him as a game manager and ride the running game instead of expecting him to be Brady or Rodgers.  Next year will be better to look for a promising alternative.  This isnt the season to be desperate for a QB and honestly we arent in desperate need for an upgrade people just want to move on for the sake of change.

Not to mention what an amazing receiving RB Matt Forte was.Shoot you give Rodgers or Brady those  AAA receivers and youve got a guaranteed trip to the Superbowl regardless of the defenses performance.Youre trying to say Cutler floundered because of noname supporters? Look at Matt Ryans NFL record this year.  different receivers! Can you name all  after Julio Jones? Can you name one of them after Jones? Of course you cant no one can but thats the point! Ryan made the most of what he had to work with.And look at Aaron Rodgers. A defense as bad as the Bears maybe worse no RB a WR playing RB due to injuries his star receiver Nelson sidelined and they still trounced the Cowboys.Cutler had the weapons. He just couldnt utilize them to their fullest potential. A weapon is only as good as the person using it.And who was the worst HC in the league? Trestman? He had a chance at the playoffs if they kept McCown in in . He had TDs to Int in  games.  Cutler came back and threw Ints and TDs in the final  games to end the season.Last I checked  isnt worst.

His doctors told him it may be a problem in  years but do not expect it to be an issue while he still plays.

11521919,0,t3_64gpk6,TLDR I think this is a pretty positive film session for Glennon.  He was very competitive in a hostile environment with virtually no run game and constant pressure from all over the place.  One of the knocks on him was that he tends to ball up under pressure but I think we see here that he makes some damn solid throws under pressure.  Hes also clearly not dripping athleticism but I think hed qualify for sneaky athletic or maybe more athletic than youd expect.  He didnt secure the win here but I think all things considered he played well.  They were asking him to do A LOT this game but if you start to project how he may do with a more consistent run game an above average oline and potentially some weapons on the outside in Kevin White and Cam Meridith.  You can get his passes down to about  a game so that he doesnt HAVE to win you the game although I think he is capable as he showed in the Steelers game the week before.,CHIBears,dg20f2s,17,t5_2s0u3

11708546,0,t3_672dbm,I think a lot of people dont value kickers as much as they should. A good kicker can mean the difference in a lot of games. Field position plays a huge role in a ball control offense like the bears seem to want to run. All the missed extra points last year in the league costs teams wins and potential playoff spots. And field goals have always been a huge difference maker. Kickers will always be looked down upon by meat heads because its not an overly masculine position but it takes a ton of balls to nail a  yard game winning field goal in front of  thousand fan while the other team runs an all out blitz against you.

11781208,0,t1_dgvfi5g,There is the rd rounder next year sure. But the first rounders were a swap so null in my pov.Im viewing it as the net difference between scenario  of having Trubisky or scenario  of having someone else at the third pick was a rd and th and rd next year.,CHIBears,dgvfrq2,3,t5_2s0u3
11781738,0,t3_67z6ww,Im a Tar Heel fan and now thanks to Trubisky Im also a Bears fan.  Would you guys flip shit if you took Ryan Switzer or Mack Hollins in the th or later?  From my vantage point you need more weapons and Ryan Switzer is McCaffery in a slightly smaller body Seriously go compare their combine numbers.  Virtually the same except Switz is  shorter and lbs lighter.Just want your thoughts!  BearDown am I doing it right??,CHIBears,dgvhxps,1,t5_2s0u3

11782202,0,t1_dgvis0n,Yes because spending tons of money on guys have worked so well for before. Over spending hurts a team wayyyy more then not signing them. Look at Brock lobster they had to give a nd away to to get rid of him.

The way multiple other teams jumped up for all we know its possible the Chiefs or Texans or hell even the jags had a package ready. We will never know.Is it possible the ers had zero interest in moving down further than  and basically fleeced the Bears? Sure its possible. But to say with such conviction that we didnt have to trade up shows absolutely no critical thinking whatsoever.,CHIBears,dgvqqvc,7,t5_2s0u3

11791691,0,t3_686g40,Wow I really just dont know much about this guy. Everything I see seems encouraging though.  A bit of a diamond in the rough he might have lasted into the rd round but we dont have a pick there so Pace got his guy.This is the type of pick that makes or breaks a GM.

11792065,0,t1_dgwnsjx,I hope they were working off better info but I just have not heard anyone from any team say that they were looking at him and what they were offering to get him so as of right now it does kind of seem like SF took us for a ride. I hope it comes out after the draft that the Chiefs were battling for him or something like that but past experience has left my faith in Bears GMs a bit shaken. Not just with the draft but with everything in general. They cant ever seem to get all of the pieces to fall into place.,CHIBears,dgwo55k,1,t5_2s0u3

11800486,0,t1_dgx2yss,He did a lot different in this draft than previous ones though. One thing that all our picks had in common from his first two years is that nearly all of them were from major conference football teams and had extensive tape against top level competition.

Off the top of my head Kyle Prater from Proviso was the Number  reciever in the country and a five star recruit to USC. He definitely didnt live up to expectations and transfered to NU but he was a bigger recruit. Laquon Treadwell was another five star recruit out of Crete Monee. Theres probably at least a dozen more five star skill position recruits from Illinois since  in addition to probably close to a hundred simarilry ranked four star skill postion recruits.,CHIBears,dgyjdpd,8,t5_2s0u3
