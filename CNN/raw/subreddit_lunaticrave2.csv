4251163,0,t3_38rymk,To enable it go into the skins keys settings and find . Set it to  to only display fastslow or  to display both fastslow and your normal target difference. Make sure the setting below it  is set to  this should be default. Then go back to the music select and make sure some type of ghost score is enabled in the system options.There are some issues with it though. First off its backwardsif you press a key too fast itll say slow and vice versa. Second after poking around the skin to see how it works it seems to be a clever abuse of certain builtin timers. Basically dont expect it to be too accurate.,lunaticrave2,cs4tjxx,1,t5_360ew
4797069,0,t1_ctz657q,i dont know if this applies to all IIDX BMSes but the ones i have all use .wav files. and those are usually unaltered uncompressed high quality sound which means higher file sizes which in turn means more memory to leak. having a video on top of that just makes the problem worse.this is probably why a lot of BMS OF FIGHTERS packages use .ogg files.also the Tricoro skin i have isnt even HD and i cant run it to save my life. the video of the background animation just wrecks LR.,lunaticrave2,ctz7jsr,1,t5_360ew
8789513,0,t3_50hym1,I personally use a Razer Blackwidow and its great! Mechanical keyboards take a bit to get used to because of the odd key press feeling they have compared to conventional keyboards but once you get used to it itll be perfectly fine.,lunaticrave2,d74d458,1,t5_360ew
