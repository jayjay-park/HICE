276159,0,t1_cf98z23,Agreed.  We Titans of Rigel had discussed who would help Zack with the stipulation that he had to ask.  He never asked until that moment that was shown.

294756,0,t3_1xf78i,I should also point out that I am a fencer which is why I wanted to display swordfighting skills in my challenge and we could because Monks can use swords in real life and in some RPGs like  A monk roleplaying or in real life is certainly not defined as someone with just acrobatic abilities. That of course is defined as an acrobat.Also the judging criteria for the play was based on our LARPing ability over anything else. We of course thought staying within the criteria of LARP would keep us in the game. We knew full well if it became a performance piece and not a LARP we were going to lose anyways because since losing josh we didnt have anyone that had experience in impressing an audience so we might as well do a true LARP. It gives us a chance to win case being we did the assignment they didnt vs. a nearzero probability if we tried to put on a play like the TOR .Im not a fan of subjective competitions in general as you never know what youre being judged on which is why I prefer Epee fencing.,kingofthenerds,cfbbfaf,6,t5_2ukbi

553348,0,t1_cg24faz,I think Brian is very interesting.  He has a real gift for voice impressions and a tremendous sense of humor.  I loved his How a wookie asks for Little Caesars Pizza.  He is obviously extremely well read with excellent comprehension and application of what he reads such as his description of Zack as some kind of character out of Dostoevsky.  It was a real shame to see him miss a book question but his reasoning was sound that the Napoleonic Era was not about kings.  He just didnt know that the book was about a fantastic alternate timeline of that era in which dragons existed because he had not read it. ,kingofthenerds,cg367sd,7,t5_2ukbi

3516149,0,t1_cpt1osq,Of course the question of all stars. Its tricky. I dont even know if Id be asked just because I wasnt on long enough to generate buzz or attention. If I do get asked my answer would really depend on what I have going on when that happens both professionally and emotionally. There are so many factors that go into that call and my relationship with the show is hopefully understandably complicated. My answer is a firm and decisive I dunno. Also this isnt the first mention Ive seen on here of bringing back the first eliminated constants for the allstars season. Man I really gotta stress how much that wont happen. The nerds who would be asked back would be people who made good TV and have the potential to still make good TV.

3553760,0,t1_cpx4rc5,Upvote to counter the downvotes and for a fellow Periwinkle Hru.  Ive not seen any evidence of this alleged goading never even heard of it except from you actually.  This is not to say it did or did not happen just saying the information seems to be th generation at least and weve all played the telephone game.  Neither of us was in the room whenif it happened and neither of us have seen footage of it.My point about reading the contract is she seems to keep making these claims of harassment again with no evidence to back it up we have no idea if they are emailing her daily or if it was one mail and she just wont shut up about it or somewhere in between.  All Im saying is if she agreed to be contacted she agreed to be contacted.  Like I said I side with her and think they should just cut all ties with her especially if shes expressed that desire.  But if she agreed to be contacted for promotional purposes then they can do so.  We can all agree they shouldnt but they have the right...because she gave it to them.  Now heres the kicker.  Do I agree they should leave her alone?  Yes.  Do I believe they are hounding her to make an appearance? No. She probably gets the same email ALL the past contestants get making the offer which she is free to accept or deny as she sees fit.  Or as the case may be blow out of proportion for her own reasons.  Would a person who wants to put the experience behind her keep posting about it? Or does that sound more like something a person seeking attention and milking that  minutes would do?,kingofthenerds,cpxcoys,1,t5_2ukbi
