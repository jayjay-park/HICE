6616203,0,t1_czxcgh9,The Magic Remote does work off Bluetooth I believe. However my understanding is that the Device Connector is for more than just STBs and Magic Remotes. In theory I think you can also use it to connect your LG phone your LG refrigerator etc and effectively run anyall of them off your TV screen. The interoperability with the STB has less to do with it being Bluetooth or IR connected though again I think. From watching the video tutorials it seems like the Device Connector connects to the STB via the existing HDMI input but basically imports all of the channel and content data for use within WebOS. Youre then using the remote to navigate the WebOS interface where your channel and show information now reside. Its been a while now since I watched the videos but I distinctly remember leaving with the impression that if you set up the Live Menu on WebOS via the Device Connector you could disconnect your STB entirely and store it elsewhere as its functionality would now be built in to the TV.Thats just what I took away from the experience though. Im not a WebOS expert by any means ... and I tried to stop thinking about the whole thing several weeks ago. ,webos,d03o73s,1,t5_2qn76
