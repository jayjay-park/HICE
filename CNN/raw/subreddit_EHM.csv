3559446,0,t3_312yvm,Haha right on. I found it funny that he retired in my game after the  season despite having a pretty good year.,EHM,cpy02wc,2,t5_2un4p
3567199,0,t1_cpyrg52,Damn. Is there any way to get the type of contract Im talking about when signing a new player?,EHM,cpyvyav,1,t5_2un4p
3596716,0,t1_cq28uqy,Those guys are likely not doing much hitting shot blocking takaways etc but are scoring points which is good. Those guys are valuable in your top six assuming their AvR isnt like . or below. Guys who arent scoring a lot of points but doing a lot of other things will have higher AvRs. My strategy since starting EA is to let my coach control the lines and play whichever players have the best AvR. If someone plays  games and his AvR is bad I try to trade him for someone else of that position. This is not the case with players in their early twenties. I will let them ride the pine and hope they can pick up their game if someone gets injured or whoever I replaced them with also sucks.,EHM,cq2939v,1,t5_2un4p

3960988,0,t1_cr7nikk,Of course I kept a couple of players past their prime age... and lost them to free agency.Its a bit of an issue with the game IMO. You have a player you drafted that played all his career with you your team is still a top contender you offer him a huge contract... and he still wants to go and try free agency to make less money for a worst team? After losing a couple of those to free agency I dont get overly attached anymore.,EHM,cr7sb6d,3,t5_2un4p
4018221,0,t1_cre60zo,Nope hes been injured three times in four years two of the times early on in the season and just once later during the playoffs. The late one was a minor injury though. Really cant afford to play the backup when my starter is this guy,EHM,creb32u,2,t5_2un4p

6334719,0,t1_cz9ks16,Do you have a link to that thread? I just drafted Matthews and hes doing pretty well in preseason. Im thinking of putting him on my AHL squad but he still has junior eligibility. Should I send him back to juniors or keep him in the AHL?,EHM,cz9os11,1,t5_2un4p
6443015,0,t3_43vp14,Back in EHM  I had this file that I ran with for about  years. There was this kid Bedrich Pavlas who was a big body with solid mentals who I drafted in the first round. After some development he was a th line guy with prime PK time. Eventually tweened between rd line RW and th line C Since I had stacked centermen regens including Sundin and I think just a regularly drafted Tavares among other studs  I had a Jagr clone named Jaromir Jurik of all names... but this is all besides the point... man I miss that save so much.Anyways back to Pavlas. He was a solid bottom  guy posting . AvR or thereabouts and posting about  points a year. So one year I get completly decimated by injuries on the RW  and my farm system was slim on RW for some reason. So I play Pavlas in the top . I didnt know he was an midtohigh  AvR player who could chip in offense. Went on a strong  goal season or something like that. I had drafted him late st round so he had some kind of pedigree but his attributes always made him a better checker. It was weird since due to injuries he wasnt playing with my uber guys either. Just the extra icetime and not having to deal with pure checkers.,EHM,czlqwu5,4,t5_2un4p

7881574,0,t3_4n93hv,I have found that a coach will always pick his favourite Goalie and over use himThat being said if you do not have Use current lines when possible then you do not have Markstrom as your starting goalie. Your coach will pick whoever he feels is best for the job at that current moment.The coach likely believes that Markstrom is the goalie of the future and has a higher ceiling hence the coach report.It is a bit strange that he would select Markstrom when you ask him to set the lines before the game but switches in game. This is the part of your post that I have not seen before and im not sure what to say haha,EHM,d41ynms,5,t5_2un4p

8181974,0,t3_4rdm25,Had to let go of Jeff Skinner. He was becoming a UFA and just came off a career year. My young guys were stepping up and were going to ask for a lot of money soon. He wouldve slotted in our top  but only for two more years and there was no way he was taking a year deal unless it was for an outrageous amount of money that I didnt have.The Flames got him on a x deal. I wish him the very best.,EHM,d50aowe,2,t5_2un4p
8273376,0,t1_d5bmb3m,I had Matthews and i just threw straight to the st line and st line pppk. Pretty much playinh him as much as i could. He won the calder with like  points.,EHM,d5bqbkz,2,t5_2un4p
8317889,0,t1_d5h6j5l,Jagr stopped early. You are correct on all parts although Messier is not on any of the records for some reason and he would knock him out of top  in assists,EHM,d5hajbr,1,t5_2un4p

8396000,0,t1_d5r15ky,I always wait for december  for the contract ending message before signing. i signed the deal around february.

8749280,0,t3_4zvl11,To answer your second question Im pretty sure its just randomly determined if a player will want to pursue a career as a scoutcoach after they retire. I wish it would change so that its more often since right now only like  of retired players will go on to be coaches or scouts though its a much higher percentage in real life.,EHM,d6zbd0r,4,t5_2un4p

10059955,0,t1_dbismx5,Well partially I know because Im from Canada and I love the Canadian Hockey League. Partially its just because I started scouting leagues and realized that not many good players came from OUTSIDE of those few leagues. Plus the BCHL AJHL and SJHL are all Junior A leagues meaning theyre a league under the WHLOHLQMJHL. ,EHM,dbiu4gb,2,t5_2un4p
