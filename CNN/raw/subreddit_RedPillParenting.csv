5662954,0,t1_cwz018h,The problem with aikido is it doesnt work. It is very dangerous as it gives false sense of security. Bacisally there are martial arts and there are combat sports. The difference is that sports are competitive and martial arts are demonstrative. I strongly prefer combat sports because in them all things that dont work get weened out because of competitive nature. I hope that makes sense Im typing on my phone.,RedPillParenting,cwz1m0q,2,t5_31v23
9494933,0,t3_5atkry,Have you had a conversation with her about how your work is challenging and draining and it would be a huge relief for you to come home and not have to clean up the dogs mess or get on her case about her homework etc?I remember what it was like to be in middle school. Solipsism comes to a head as you start to realize that adults dont know everything but youre also starting to develop the ability to actually empathize. It causes a lot of internal confusion and sometimes you need to be reminded that the world exists beyond what you personally experience. Middle school is also an awful place to go through this awful time dealing with all your peers who are at the same stage of mental development as you.Shes probably the childparent version of shit testing. She might be internalizing resentment towards you in part because as you mentioned shes more sheltered than her friends. The ultimate goal for most people in middle school is to fit in and having that massive gap between her and her friends is likely causing her emotional stress which shes blaming you for and lashing out by testing your limits.The other part of her likely resentment is the classic you cant possibly understand me exacerbated by the fact that she doesnt directly have her mother to complain to about this. It might be a good idea to also talk to her about how you understand that shes going through changes that you dont have personal experience with but you still want to support her.My own disobedience towards my father in middle school largely stemmed from a growing feeling that because he wasnt like me I couldnt trust him with everything. Try to build your relationship so that she feels like she can confide in you and she understands that every relationship needs give and take. Youre doing your best to help her succeed but you need her to help you too. Of course maintain that she needs to respect you and you are not willing to deal with her disobedience but it will probably help to show her why she should respect you. It sounds like she doesnt respect the consequences youve set for her actions so she might require a new approach.Edit Also what are your reasons for sheltering her? From my experience dealing with people who were raised sheltered it hampers their ability to find an identity that is their own. I havent yet met a sheltered person whose life was made better by it most of them are either still clueless about the world or managed to develop as a person despite being shelteredafter breaking free of their parents control.,RedPillParenting,d9jgbzk,2,t5_31v23
