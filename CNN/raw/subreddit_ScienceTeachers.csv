The mere beginnings of that level of understanding is likely a year or more of advanced university courses away for even the higher level students in an AP course.Oh and make them graph the initial and final values with uncertainty bars easy in excel.

It will provide a much more hands on approach to teaching kids the stages of a plants life cycle. You actually plant seeds and watch them grow up to produce there own seeds again.

3957766,0,t1_cr7dplz,. We all agree that any program that offers live classroom experience is what would be best. I will say that some of the psych courses helped me not immediately but soon enough to give me perspective. Any program will give you the content necessary for the job. The gig is to decide how best to spend the rest of your undergrad. Anything that gets you in a classroom is top choice and after that anything that helps you understand the job and the people in it. About liability. Maybe too strong a word. Whether you do a concentration in physics or go with a physics major youre going to receive a red carpet welcome at any public school just about. Temper that further by considering that the administration would be more hopeful ? about an Ed major with a content concentration teacher than a science major in many cases. The simple fact is that in eight years Ive watched every new nonEd hire leave for industry or higher academia. No blame thrown. They are generally less prepared for the classroom and they generally have better options outside of teaching public school. No fault there. People are intelligent and they have potential and they should exercise it.If I had two candidates who I knew were both capable for the job Id hire the one who was more ready to deal with children and had training specific to the classroom.

Come up with predictable routines for things like turning in homework and going to the bathroom to minimize pointless interruptions.Set clear objectives for what you want to teach. Sit down with whatever standards your district has and break those standards down into chunks and rewrite them in studentfriendly language so that you and your kids will always know what goal theyre trying to reach today.Most importantly dont beat yourself up for not being great at everything or not having every lesson be inquirybased and perfect. My professors put so much emphasis on why it was soooooo important for every kid to be scientifically literate and how every lesson needed to engage them in inquiry and if you ever lectured you were the Devil reborn as a science teacher. The fact is those perfect lessons wont work for every group of kids. Figure out what your kids are capable of and work with that. The most important part of a class is how you interact with your students so whether theyre doing a handson lab or filling out a worksheet be there to guide and help them out.

To take that literally is missing the entire point which makes me believe youre not really interested in doing much better than just trying to prove me wrong.

The RNA World Hypothesis explains quite clearly how the issue of the complete synthesis of RNA nucleotides has been a major stumbling block. It has not been resolved just because you assert that it has. And I find it a convenient out just to say well maybe we will understand it some day.  No you wont but if that satisfies you theres not much more I can say. It doesnt satisfy me and I dont think it should you either. And I am fairly certain that you will have trouble finding even one example of a transitional species at a DNA level. Id love to see a list of the thousands you have discussed.

If anything incomplete classwork or extra creditWell spend the first few minutes doing intro then well review the last class. We usually have a  question quiz at this point. Maybe  minutes for a formal lesson. Typically the rest of the class is hands on lab work or project time. Sometimes well split it up with a secondary lesson.This way theyre working in groups we dont have to spend much time lecturing. All assessment is done by talking with students in their groups quizzes and project presentations. There really hasnt been much evidence that homework is actually beneficial. But the main reason we dont send homework home is because it acts as an economic barrier. I dont want my borderline homeless students to fail the class simply because it is harder for them to get to a computer or because they are too busy working a job.
