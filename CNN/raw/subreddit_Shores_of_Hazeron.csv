3093721,0,t1_coinnx6,I do agree. Cant just give up on the game  and I actually like Haxus as he is. I like how hes free and doesnt care about shit and neither does he care about money. Hes a symbol freedom and greatness  eventually. ,Shores_of_Hazeron,coinvbm,0,t5_2s1zj
3123868,0,t3_2vkdnw,All things considered there is an entire factor to how big the galaxies were before that nobody really consistently noticed The fact that there were honest to god full other galaxies. It was fucking mental to think about how large it was.I feel like people are only upset about the gameworld being smaller because he simplified it in a way that seemed really bad. Hey Theres only gonna be th of the universe there was before sounds fucking horrific but when you realize that just means that in our lifetime a whole galaxy might actually be explored perspective sets in and most people would realize that they arent losing much.I understand wanting enough content to keep you busy and wanting enough that you could realistically always be discovering new systems Its still gonna be like that. The metrics arent too terribly different.  of people will be able to travel in a direction for literal days and not find the end of the galaxygameworld. And thats perfectly fine to me. Its still huge.Honestly while hes testing and building up to a bigger gameworld he should disable Warp simply so it doesnt break down to Our level  overlords want more TL Petroleum get to work. Because thats the only problem with the game.,Shores_of_Hazeron,colsdaz,1,t5_2s1zj
