8942240,0,t3_4wcl2t,This movie was complete garbage. WB hyped up the Joker for over a year Leto went into method acting and they only put him in it for like less than  minutes of screen time. The famous I cant wait to show you my new toys scene was used in EVERY TRAILER and they didnt use the scene once. To me it sounds like the joker was a big marketing ploy and boy did they fool all of us. Granted I actually like Letos Joker but I wanted more of him The cast was honestly great. Robbie nailed Quinn and her chemistry with Deadshot was great. Captain Boomerang was awesome along with everyone else but again these were just great performances led by a horrendous script.The whole scene where Harley Quinn goes up the elevator? What the hell was that scene put in there for? To show Quinn beat up a couple baddies before just continuing on with the movie? Waste of screen time and script. Everything felt so forced.And what was the whole deal with Diablos family quote. Youve known these people for like  hours and I sure a hell didnt feel the bond you had with all of them considering you were in the back the whole time and hardly said anything to them.And if I hear were bad guys from these guys one more time. That term was so forced into the movie. Yes theyre bad guys but cmon WB? The movie lacked a tone to hold onto. It got some things right with some characters and what have you but it got a lot of things wrong where they needed to be right.All this being said Im really hoping there will be a directors cut or extended version like BvS. A version without WB sticking there nose in everything that has a chance as a movie. I actually like BvS but this was atrocious. Its fun to see these actors do their thing but it makes me cringe much much more. I really hope WB gets the point after all this blows over.,DCEU,d7mq4ri,1,t5_38yqn
11695482,0,t3_650nab,There isnt really any news just that it most likley is suicide squad  or gotham city sirens... with a release earliest in the summer. Most people think suicide squad  is the most likley option... I thought the best bet is gotham city sirens but than i heard that David Ayer is still in post production with his other film.. and considering the characters for suicide squad  are allready cast and! they started writing it a couple months ago it seems pretty logical now. The only thing that keeps it in the air is that the director is still missing...  but they are trying hard to get that fixed all the news about all the directors in talks. No Idea about those rumors tho... I only heard about that harley quinn could be replaced by another character in the sequel. But yes as of right now the chances are good its going to be a movie based in gotham.. why I dont include GLC Dark Universe The Flash? Its just way too much CGI in it... and i think only Dark Universe has a finished script and a director!!  who sadly is very busy as of right now... altho if this rumor with the summer filming start is true... it could be a contender too I at least hope so but you hear nearly nothing about it.,DCEU,dglp99y,1,t5_38yqn
