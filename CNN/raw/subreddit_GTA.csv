2570438,0,t3_2p5vr3,Im not so much disappointed with the amount of content than I am with how hard it is to play the content. I love racing deathmatches and missions online but I mostly enjoy playing with my buddies. Obviously it isnt fun playing a death match one on one in some of the larger map selections. Its such a challenge getting into a game with a friend. I know theres the option for Join Random JobRaceDeathmatchMission with friends in lobby or whatever it is but Ive always found that it often puts me into a game made by some random player itll end up being one of those shitty fake million RP games. If I select Mission itll have me host. I wouldnt mind hosting a game except it invites the rest of my friends list for some reason and I dont want to play with EVERYONE on my friends list. Its always a hassle playing with my friend on GTA Online and thus Im never suggesting to play it. I dont understand why they didnt take the posse system from Red Dead and integrate it. Id like to be able to just take my friends and join a random job and filter it so that I only get Rockstar Created or Rockstar Verified games. And hey if this is already and option and Im just an idiot please tell me. Id love to be able to play GTA Online with friends without spending forever trying to get into a game that isnt created by some putz trying to scam everyone. ,GTA,cmu3etw,1,t5_2ra77

I just know Im going to enjoy them.And while I enjoyed RDR quite a bit it didnt quite live up to some of the GTA games for me.  The story missions were great and the environments were beautiful.  But one of the things I felt was lacking was the freeroam nonmission elements.  In GTA I can have fun just wandering around seeing the sights and causing chaos.  Or stocking up my garage with fastrare cars I find.  But the various sidequests for finding plants and hunting animals didnt really do it for me.Again great game but it didnt give me the bazillions of hours that the GTA games have each given me.,GTA,coz17th,2,t5_2ra77

This means on basic consumergrade prebuilt PCs its very likely you will get WORSE frame rates than you would have gotten on PS or Xbox . If you have a custom PC with AT LEAST an i quadcore processor nvidia GTX  graphics card with  gigs of RAM on bit windows you should be okay and the game will run smoothly.However I had a lot of fun with GTA on PC and it is the game that got me into PC Gaming because the mods are absolutely amazing for that game. If you cant run it I would suggest saving up your money and building your own PC very easy to do following youtube tutorials because the experience is worth it!,GTA,crfou15,2,t5_2ra77

My opinion is play the Story Mode to at least get used to the controls how the weapon wheel works etc. Its a good game lots to do and with three different characters there is unique stuff you can do with them and make shit loads if money while fucking shit up.The online mode is a bit hit or miss on the server you land in unless you join friends. One server could be filled with Assholes while the next one could be filled with nice people chilling out and having fun whilst doing missions or heists.Leave any servers populated with kids its like herding cats. Most of all find a server you feel comfortable in and try to stick with it and try to intereact with other players. You will find like minded people.,GTA,ctlxwro,5,t5_2ra77

On PC its really badly optimized needs a few patches and still gives problems on some rigs.

Dont be cocky yourself mr who thinks he knows it all. I did a google search and on the first glance its a no. What I did find that you can move your own save files to different storage devices but that is linked to your account on both platforms. So please next time you decide to descend from you high perch remember that easily means just that copy and paste a save file into a directory. If I have to fuck around with programs and software and moving about storage devices and then if something goes wrong which it does troubleshoot the setups. That isnt easy thats moderate to hard based on level of knowledge. Once again Mr know it all cocky redditor the demographic of GTA player may be high in Modders but that doesnt mean its as high as the casual player base who dont have the knowledge of different consoles and their counterpart pc software to fuck around with game files and saves.  ,GTA,cwv1ybx,1,t5_2ra77

They were never released anywhere else except for last year when LCS was ported to mobile.  if the pattern holds VCS should get a release this year.I believe that Sony signed a contract for R to make those PSP titles which played itself in reverse with the next generation with TLAD and TBOGT being released on the  first but the PS eventually got those two DLCs too.Nowadays other than having a legit PSP the only way to play these is either on PCSX or PPSSPP which for various reasons isnt ideal.  The PSP didnt have a second stick so you have to hold the R button to look around and because it was ported from the PSP to the PS the graphics have aged even worse than the other games.Id really like to see Rockstar or War Drums release LCS and VCS for the PC.  They dont even need to remaster it or anything  just have it on par with the other ports IIIVCSA and let modders take over the rest.,GTA,db9c69h,1,t5_2ra77
