Inside the QuadraticFormula method you have redefined those variables locally  so you are not accessing the global ones.Also Im not sure how this code could be compiling with the line      int difference  b  acBecause the b and ac should should flag an error as they are not valid constructs.

Secondly youre eschewing the compilers typechecking which makes it more likely youll make a mistake and cause a segfault.  C is meant to be quite strictly typed which means using the cast operator such as int should be quite a rare occurrence particularly when it comes to pointers.It would be better to make a function for each type of struct you have and have the logic which chooses which one to use be elsewhere.  Generally functions should be nice and small  they should do one thing and do that well.  It doesnt always work out exactly like that in practice but its a nice ideal to aim for when youre starting out.,C_Programming,cqoguwi,5,t5_2qhoe

4036628,0,t3_36oxlg,The call stack isnt actually a stack in the abstract sense which is probably where youre getting trippedup. The callstack is in general literally an array of bytes combined with a pointer into this array we call the stackpointer. The stackpointer tells us where the top of the stack is So it starts at the beginning of our array when our program starts. Since as we know we can easily take a pointer to an array and add an offset to get a pointer to a different location in the array the stack is random access  We have a pointer to it and we can use offsets into this array via the stackpointer and access any piece that we want to at any time. You can access stackpointer   access stackpointer   and then access stackpointer   again with no problem. This shouldnt be surprising because thats how arrays are theyre random access.When you call a function you first adjust the stackpointer so that it points to the new top of the array. Thus when a function is called it in general decides Im going to use  bytes of stack space save the stackpointer somewhere increments the stackpointer by  and then uses the saved stackpointer  offsets to access any of the bytes its making use of. So if it needs that  bytes for ints a b c d then it can use savedstackpointer   to access b or add  to access c instead. Obviously because were just doing offsets into wherever the stackpointer tells us we can access any spot we want we dont have to do it sequentially.The key is that by incrementing the stackpointer by the amount were making use of when we call a function it will also use the stackpointer and start writing to the array right after the last byte we used So if we stopped at byte  it would start at byte . That function also increments the stackpointer by how much it uses so called functions start writing to the stack right at the end of where all the other functions wrote to the stack. When a function returns it decrements the stackpointer back to what it was originally so when the function we returned too calls another function the stackpointer is in the correct place. As you can see it acts like a stack in the sense that when you call a function it starts writing to the top of the stack Like you would with a stack. But it doesnt act like a stack in the sense that you can access any part of the stack you want at any given time.,C_Programming,crgemmr,2,t5_2qhoe
4042713,0,t1_crgrop3,Kinda. The FILE structure has an offset inside which indicates where the next read will take place. You can use ftell to get this exact position Though for this situation the exact offset is not important. Point being functions like fscanf start reading from the file starting at this offset and also increment this offset by however many bytes they endup processing. So if you call fscanf twice the second fscanf will start reading the file at the location of the offset which will be right where the first fscanf stopped reading. In this way youre right youll only scan a number one time because after you scan it the offset of the FILE will be located past that number. Any subsequent fscanf calls Or any other function to read from a FILE will never read that data again.The reason I said not exactly is that fseek allows you to change that offset directly  So if you do an fscanf after opening a FILE and then do fseekfile  SEEKSET that will set the offset back to zero effectively putting you back at the beginning of the file. If after the fseek you call fscanf again youll again start at the offset Which is now zero and read the same data you read before.In general if you dont use fseek then youll never endup reading any data twice. fseek can be very useful though. A common use is if you have random access files Where you have a bunch of entries all the same size so you can easily calculate the offset of any one entry and also when you want to read a file again without closing it You can fseek to the beginning of the file and then just start reading it again like normal.,C_Programming,crh3mbv,2,t5_2qhoe

4806160,0,t3_3gove2,Wow lots of people missing the question here. OP is asking about stack frames not the stack as a whole.Its mostly determined at compile time. The compiler knows that a stack frame takes up some minimum amount of space such as storage for old return address old stack pointer and old frame pointer this depends on the CPU and calling conventionABI in use. Some CPUs have instructions that set up the stack frame automatically so if the compiler uses those its stuck with whatever format the CPU puts it in.Then it pushes onto the stack space for any local variables it needs. In unoptimized code variables are pushed and popped as they become live or dead but optimizing compilers usually just tally up how much theyll need and reserve all of the space once at the beginning of the function. Either way at any point the compiler knows exactly how big the stack frame is.Unless you use alloca or variablelengths arrays in C which have the same effect. Those behave like malloc allocating an amount of space known only at runtime but it does it on the stack. At that point the compiler no longer knows how big the stack frame is. Now its obligated to keep a separate frame pointer and stack pointer whereas on most architectures its simpler and easier to use only the stack pointer since the compiler always knows how big the stack frame is.However alloca and VLAs are extremely rare. Most of the time if you assume that the compiler knows the size of a stack frame at compile time youd be correct.gt is there any way I can determine stack frame size myself like the sizeof operator to determine size of variablesNot that Im aware of. This usually requires deep knowledge of the platform in question. Even switching to a different compiler on the same platform or changing optimization levels could potentially change this. I think the general assumption is that if you need to know youre probably dropping down to assembly anyway. C is a highlevel language where youre not supposed to know or care about the size of stack frames.,C_Programming,cu0ctvi,7,t5_2qhoe

6530656,0,t1_czurfew,A virtual machine is exactly what it sounds like its an emulation of a computer that runs as software. It gives you the ability to have a sandboxed secure virtual computer on which you can install any operating system you want or design your own operating system. Very commonly its used to run two operating systems on the same computer without having to go through the lengthy process of installing in a second partition for dual booting. You can typically choose in the settings of the virtual machine software whether or not you want hardware access to pass through in other words you can give it access to your files and your hardware say USB drives if you want.Security researchers love this because a virtual machine allows you to setup isolated networks of emulated computers you can use them to design malware or see how malware behaves in a network without compromising real data or taking up the resources of a lot of physical real world computers. Theyre also commonly used to run WindowsMac OS X without having to restart dual booting requires a reboot to use the other OS allowing you to quickly switch between programs that are WindowsMac only.I know Linux can be really intimidating but its much easier than you think. Really all Linux distributions are the the same at their core. Just like Windows can come packaged with different software and desktop backgrounds Microsoft Office but still be the same operating system Linux distributions are all the same internally. They may use different installers or Graphic Interfaces but you can more or less always customize one Linux distribution to behave exactly like another if youre willing to spend the time installing software.That said many distributions are arguably better for beginnersor people who to use Linux without learning about its internals. I would recommend you learn a bit about the structure and history of Nix operating systems its really cool!. Ubuntu and mint are common examples of these simplified distributions. They are the same OS and will run the same programs but they come installed with different desktop environments text editors internet browsers media players etc. If youre really willing to take a plunge can be very rewarding but also very incredibly frustrating Id start with Arch Linux and then maybe try out some version of BSD Unix FreeBSDNetBSDOpenBSD. These are all going to force you to learn to accomplish basically anything you will spend a lot of time reading how to install software and customize nitty gritty details since they dont do as much any really hand holding as more friendly distributions like Fedora Ubuntu or Mint Linux but you will be a much better programmer and more computer savvy person for it. Its the path I took many years ago actually.Plus with Arch Linux at least virtually every problem you may have has been solved by someone else before. Its just a matter of learning where to ask and search for questionsanswers. Google is your friend. Stack Exchange for Linux is your friend. The Arch Linux wiki is also excellent. You have a million resources for learning if youre just willing to put time into it.If this scares you just stick to something user friendly like Ubuntu Fedora my favorite or DebianMint. The experience will be mostly the same minus a few utilities and how the desktop environment looks but they are all infinitely customizable if you want. They all have graphic text editors if you dont want to dive into learning VimEmacs yet incredibly powerful and complicated command line text editors used by most hardcore nix people and they all have gcc C compiler installed by default I believe so getting started is as quick as installing then on a virtual machine. Google for a guide on this its not hard but it might be different depending on how you want to set things up.Another note the reason I say nix the word Unix comes from the original closed source operating system written by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs also the creator of the C programming language. The problem historically with the name is that when bell labs was broken up part of it became ATampT and they were shitty about licensing and the name trademark so Unix became very expensive and limited to research facilities and massive corporations. As a result a lot of people tried to design clones of the original Unix that were free or cheaper but with slightly different names Linux is the most successful attempt. More properly all Linux should be actually called GNULinux Linux is just the name of the kernel or the core of the operating system. Linux provided a core that was more or less completely compatible with the original Unix but it was missing the software for example the kernel by itself has no text editor or program to copy files or to do anything besides load processes really. These programs had to be bought from ATampT who were obviously unhappy about it and charged ridiculous sums. So the GNU project designed a mostly compatible clone of all the programs standard with original Unix these packages form the primary part of the Linux operating system distributions we know today. The name GNU GNUs not Unix is actually kind of forgotten in popular opinion the work the GNU project did to clone Unix was really arguably much more difficult than cloning the Core.All this was made more confusing in the nineties when ATampT realized it had lost and open sourced the original Unix. These sources were developed further and form the basis for modern Unix the BSD Unixes. These are mostly compatible with Linux and the structure is very similar since they were designed to be copies of the original Unix this is why people say nix or Unixlike. This is also a really really simplified history lot of really cool personal stories involved. Big lawyers early cut throat silicon valley politics the war on terror and national security the anti intellectual property and open source movement the rise of Microsoft and the Windows operating system hacker culture etc. Read a book about it its utterly fascinating.Hope this helps!,C_Programming,czutl05,5,t5_2qhoe

Its not a clang bug evidence elsewhere suggests not to glibly assume you can cast function pointers this way. Try it for yourself in clang and see. Also refer to link in OP above  did you disagree with the respondents interpretation of the standard?Also I think you are conflating two ideas. Plain void  to struct mystruct  obviously isnt going to have problems. How could C do much of anything if it did? However once you consider same within the context of a function pointer there is to my understanding more going on with the way the data is laid out thus you have no guarantees that this sort of cast works the same as the aforementioned cast on a variable UB. Indeed it would seem obvious to the casual onlooker that a bit pointer converts to a bit pointer  that was the first thing to my mind when tackling this  but in this context alignments may well be different between function pointer signatures.So theres conjecture and then theres facts.

The input will also be made up of multiple strings. The program will eventually be a text editor but Im just implementing this basic functionality first.For a solution to this Im going to try scanning in each individual character of input into a fixed length array and then using makeNode create a single string from this array and turn it into a node. Hopefully it works.EDIT ok wow it worked cant believe I didnt think of this before.,C_Programming,d84reyl,1,t5_2qhoe
9114879,0,t3_554eb2,You have to declare a function before calling it.  But you the user do not write the code that calls main.  The code that calls main is part of the implementation of the standard library and compiler runtime.  And that code has a declaration of main prewritten.  Thats why the signature of main is not under your control it must be one of the two allowed forms because it has to match that startup code thats fixed.Technically yes you dont need to declare a function before calling it but you should not rely on that.  And technically yes there is no requirement for the signature of main if youre using a freestanding implementation but in that case you arent using a standard library so it doesnt matter much that the two signatures match.,C_Programming,d87gm2f,14,t5_2qhoe

Itsnot something to rely on for correctness though since for exampleits often disabled for debugging TCO would otherwise hide importantstack frames.Modern compilers are so good at this stuff that theyll optimizenontail calls into loops.
