7224547,0,t3_4ed466,If youve already signed the new offer sheet than you missed the boat on asking for more money IMO.  There is a time for negotiations but that time is almost exclusively before an offer is accepted by the candidate Im sure there are some very rare exceptions.I cant imagine this will end well if you ask for more money before putting in a single minute of work again assuming you have signed and returned the offer having been in charge of hiringfiring people if somebody did this to me Id immediately withdraw the offer and look to the other candidates I had.  ,Salary,d1zdl2o,2,t5_2vs3d
