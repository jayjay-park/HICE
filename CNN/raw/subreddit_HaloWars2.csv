11764590,0,t1_dgtblxo,While cross play would be nice I dont think it is optimal for this title. PC players would have an advantage even if you were only considering the ability to set hot keys and click the minimap. I really dont believe the game is struggling that much to only have  players in matchmaking for a tier. If that was he case we need an update that removes some of the tiers. This could be possible they would just have to put the work in.,HaloWars2,dgtjnze,1,t5_2zeb5
