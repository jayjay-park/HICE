9161885,0,t1_d8dblg6,Depends on what country are you looking at. Where Im from in the final exam you always get to do a limited space three point turn kind of thing and then depending on your luck either parallel parking simple reverse park and diagonal or something like it. Since people usually dont pass from the first time and chances of getting parallel park are high to begin with youll most likely get tested on that. Not to mention the countless times you get to do that in school. This seems like Europe too and Id imagine rules are similar. Still even then I get how it might be difficult to people. I wasnt too confident on it too at first. Not as difficult as this lady makes it look however..,gifsthatkeepongiving,d8dc3wa,4,t5_39ssk

9997525,0,t1_dbaibnt,You are correct that CPR is unlikely to make the heart beat normally again. Its mostly useful to keep the brain oxygenated until first responders arrive. Then if the heart is in fibrillation still beating but irregular a defibrillator may fix it.However if the heart is flatlined asystole just not beating at all defibrillation wont do anything. In fact flatline usually means death permanently. A doctor can try shoving epinephrine by IV or open them up and do an internal cardiac massage pick up the heart and pump it but the chances of survival when your heart is stopped is basically nil unless the root cause can be fixed in time like a clot.No idea whats going on with this deer though.,gifsthatkeepongiving,dbapfi0,6,t5_39ssk
