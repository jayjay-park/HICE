2412251,0,t1_cm9u7ui,They have started making electronics that use lithium ion cells. Some are have specialty batteries like your cell phone. Some use the cylindrical batteries. They have some roughly the same size as AA but they are not called that since it would make people think hey can be used with older electronics. Like you are trying now.,batteries,cm9v35e,1,t5_2r11m

7774504,0,t3_4lqyec,You can but did the battery charge faster previously like when you first got the phone? If so it sounds like a bad battery and higher amps is not going to do you any favors. A replacement battery could be your best bet.,batteries,d3pwcgw,2,t5_2r11m

8005111,0,t3_4ouwlu,This is indeed an old designation for C cell batteries. The closest you could get today are Heavy Duty Chloride batteries but C cell Alkalines should work just fine. The NEDA  is a size designation that is used in the ANSI in the same way that LR is an Alkaline AA.From Wikipedia The C battery is called  in current ANSI standards of battery nomenclature and in IEC standards is designated R.The NEDA to my understanding referred to the chemistry of the battery although Im not positive on that it could be some manufacturer specific designation. Either way it requests a . volt and any alkaline should fit that requirement.,batteries,d4fum4n,1,t5_2r11m

8317459,0,t3_4tghyr,Read the chargers manual .. yep.mA is the charge current which will fluctuate a bit for example to mA and the charger will show Full on the LCD when the charging is complete. Id recommend charging your batteries at mAh since deltaV termination is less accurate at low charging currents like mA.If youre in a hurry and want to check the status you can press the display button a few times so itll show cellvoltage. When its around .v theyre almost full. The mAh indication tells the amount of energy it charged into the cells but that doesnt say much unless the batteries where completely depleted.,batteries,d5h8ls3,1,t5_2r11m
8469027,0,t1_d604s63,Thanks for the quick response. It appears then that I should select  batteries of the highest charging current to ensure I minimise the potential issues. The charger has temperature compensation so im hoping it will reduce the current if the temperature climbs above whatever the preset level is. Unfortunately the location is between a false floor and the vehicle body there is significant air gap just no flow.,batteries,d6061mc,1,t5_2r11m
