We lose Vinny to a bad contract and subpaygrade performance and now we have the loss of Marty hanging over our heads? Im disillusioned and frustrated so he unfortunately takes the brunt of my anger.

Id argue the problem is getting the puck in the net with  shots you should be able to muster more than  goals especially with the kind of talent the forwards have.

Ill boo Danny Boyle Dominic Moore and yes Marty along with Kreider McDonagh and Lundquist equally when they take the ice. But to keep on calling him the Hobbit and the Tiny Traitor and yada yada is insulting to me. Hes been such a hero to me over the years basically half of my life that theres no way Im going to keep silent about it. So I do take it personally. Its been well over a year and there doesnt seem to be any end to it in sight. I think MSL gave all of his heart to this team and I cant understand the continued animosity against him. Im sorry to come off as someone personally attacking all the people on this subreddit but it seems like the majority of our following seem to take his leaving a little too personal themselves. I hope you find it in you to forgive him one day and see that he is just as qualified to have his number retired along his long time line mate Lecavalier no matter the circumstances of his departure. ,TampaBayLightning,cr9lse7,0,t5_2rqi8

6123314,0,t1_cylleru,gtDid he? When? Provide metrics. points in  games given the limited ice time and usage he had is nothing to sneeze at as a young player. He started off this season very hot on the top line and then his production cratered and he was back on the grinder line. Cooper tolerates very few mistakes or bad games from Drouin and its been that way since the beginning. Meanwhile guys like Filppula and Killorn can play horribly for games on end and there are no consequences. I can see why Drouin might not feel hes being treated fairly though his reaction was immature and showed a lack of character.gtCooper was hard on Kucherov as well. Everyone seems to forget this.If Connolly hadnt been injured Kucherov may still be getting  minutes a night or playing in Syracuse. It was only the injuries that brought the triplets together and forced Coopers hand to continue playing him in a top  situation. Cooper as much as said he wasnt planning on putting Kuch on the roster last season.If you want to know why people are questioning Cooper there is a start. He plays favorites and has a certain type of forward he wants like Palat and if a player cant or wont develop into that role he just doesnt play them. Unfortunately the team has guys who arent his desired way forwards and he seems to have trouble adapting his system to fit them. Stamkos he cant do much about and has likely been ordered to play him at center as much as possible due to the contract mess. Drouin he can just staple to the th line or scratch. FWIW I have serious doubts as to the viability of JAM as a permanent NHLer. Maybe his production will keep up but I dont think thats a given. Which means were either trading Drouin for a roster player who can produce in place of JAMDrouin or calling up a pissedoff and unmotivated Drouin. Not a good situation considering were not sitting on a ton of NHLready forwards in Syracuse.,TampaBayLightning,cylnnyv,5,t5_2rqi8

I dont know how serious it is. Doug Armstrong and Steve Yzerman know each other really well. Theyre very close friends. I think if they wanted to make a deal they probably could. Theres a bit of guesswork involved in there. I do think there is the possibility something happens there but how big it is or how small it is Im not  percent sure at this point.gt I did think there was a time it might be Rob Fabbri but I dont think thats going to happen anymore. I think Fabbri has culled himself a nice niche in the St. Louis lineup.Thats the entire article and it says exactly nothing. Whereas the OP has new quotes from Yzerman about making movesgt We were hoping a month ago wed be in the thick of a playoff race and we are in the thick of a playoff race Yzerman said. Its a month from the deadline and if something makes sense to make us a better team that can help us one get in the playoffs and have a good playoff run we would look at it.gt I believe we have a good team Yzerman said.

6395977,0,t3_439bl7,I will say there is definite smoke from the St. Louis speculation but that has been going on for over a month and Ive written about it a few times. Originally I had heard hockey trade of a forward for a defenseman as a strong possibility. And for me that hinted pretty strongly at Kevin Shattenkirk since hes a semirental and would fit in well alongside Jason Garrison on the second pair allowing Sustr to slot back down next to Coburn.But with how much things have changed with Drouin its possible that the target could be Parayko and maybe a pick or a minor prospect for Drouin. Parayko is already establishing himself well in the NHL. Hes got another year on his ELC and is decently young. The counterbalance and why I think Yzerman would look for a little something extra to sweeten the pot is that hes older than Drouin has a year or two less of controlled time and has a lower ceiling than Drouin.,TampaBayLightning,czgnnma,2,t5_2rqi8

Stralman basically always stops because hes an awesome man. Also depends on if they are leaving tonight to fly out or if they fly out tomorrow. If theyre flying tonight probably not many stopping.The other option to see a player is the radio show behind Section  after the game.

6833944,0,t1_d0qthsd,So... Ive been thinking about it for a bit... I think the only guys that they would seriously look at moving right now are guys that they wont call up. I think Blunden Angelidis McGinn Taormina Gudlevskis are all safe. While I think its possible Gudlevskis is moved this summer as hell be waiver eligible after camp next year and hed surely get claimed I dont think the club can risk not having a capable rd goalie as a back up and Wilcox isnt that guy yet.Paradis Tambellini Broll and Witkowski would top my list of players that could be moved though. Tambellini and Witkowski would be the most valuable and might be able to bring us back some AHL depth thats like  years old and will play for Syracuse for another couple years. Paradis and Broll dont have much value but Paradis is a Group VI UFA this summer like Witkowski and I think Broll will be a nontender candidate. Yanni might also be a slim chance but Im betting hes still got another year before the Lightning give up on him.,TampaBayLightning,d0qxg4w,2,t5_2rqi8

How his face got cut isnt central to the issue its not about the result its about the action preceding it. My point is that when Blunden was on his feet and looking for the guy pounding on him Abdelkader shifted to reverse and stomped the gas.As for Nik Nasty and Richards Im not a fan of guys still throwing when the other guy is on the ground. But if were going to debate the merits of clean fighting Ill point out that at least that was the result of a oneonone square off. Comparing it to Abbys groundandpound action is apples to cunty oranges and Im not sure I can take you seriously. Does Abdelkader have something to answer for? Yes. Do I see that happening?

7659728,0,t3_4k7ole,So Ive noticed a trend already in the ECF. First game for the home team is a fairly definitive loss  BoltsPens  PensBolts and then the second game will hopefully be an OT win. So using this logic heres how its gonna play outOnce again itll be tied  at the end of the third and the team skates off seemingly out of fuel and tired. Vasya has faced more shots this game than the past three combined. But coming out of the locker room for OT they seem more energized than ever. Suddenly the lights cut out in Amalie completely except for one on the locker room tunnel. But whats that? Bah Gawd thats Steven Stamkos music! The captain charges out of the tunnel for the first time in the playoffs to take the face off. Stamkos drops it back to Hedman who then passes it up to Drouin as he enters the zone. Suddenly the Penguins see Stamkos on the left face off for. How did he get there so soon? Murray knowing his fate simply turtles to avoid the shot from Stamkos as the puck punches through the net and bounces off the boards to inexplicably hit Mike Milbury in the head.

7904719,0,t1_d44gyhi,Wait. Drouin would be carrying Stamkos? And Stamkos might go back to being great? It doesnt take a rocket scientist to realize that players have trouble being consistent when their line changes on a nightly basis. You know whose line hasnt really changed? The Triplet line. So while Johnson is getting fed points by Palat and Kucherov Stamkos is stuck with the hockey version of a Hot Potato player Filppula. And yet he still put up better numbers than Johnson. Its no surprise that a player needs a supporting cast as line mates to stay consistent. One example Sidney Crosby. When he has the right guys around him he is unstoppable. Another example Alex Ovechkin. Probably the biggest comparable. Not sure if you have looked at his stat sheet over his career but he went through a slump around the same age around the time that Semin left. Have you looked to see how well Johnson plays without Kuch or Pally? He isnt the same player. Have you seen Kucherov alone? He is insane. Stamkos? Still putting up . points per game. Just a heads up you have to do well in the regular season to make the playoffs. Just pointing something out the Lightning were the highest scoring team in the NHL in . If you took away Stamkos goals we drop from number  to the bottom half of the league. Where are we without those goals? We may not have even made the playoffs. Then you wouldnt be able to use this as an excuse. And in case you havent noticed to go deep in the playoffs you need players outside of your stars to show up. I.e. Rust and Sheary in Pittsburgh. Killorn and Johnson for us last season. Saad and Shaw for Chicago last season. Here is a name Ruslan Fedotenko. Ryan Carter Steve Bernier Steven Gionta in  for New Jersey. Depth is what wins you championships. Stars get you there. Edit My whole reason for posting this is because it seems like the only people that dont want Stamkos in the entire league are Lightning fans and it makes absolutely no sense. ,TampaBayLightning,d44kdth,1,t5_2rqi8

And that Namestnikov highsticking call was an absolute disgrace. I went back in slow motion and i dont think the stick ever touches PhaGoofs face. It hits his shoulder and if anything barely grazes his visor. AND DONT GET ME FUCKING STARTED ON THAT GOALIE INTERFERENCE CALL! What a horrendous call! And lastly Vasy. I understand you cant blame the goalie for everything but damn. Sometimes you need your goalie to get you out of a funk and that has been their teams biggest problem they cant seem to get out of this slump. Vasy just cant seem to make those keys saves to win you a hockey game. Two years ago we had the best offense in the National. Then in the playoffs we learned that if you wanna win in this league you gotta play a solid defensive game. So in the next season we we pretty good on defense and we could win those  games.

11070822,0,t1_demrkve,Bishop was never intended to be a solution but he became one. Lindback wasnt getting it done and there was no one available. Conacher was on fire but expendable. Bishop was playing behind Anderson and Ottawa needed offensive generation. At worst Ben was a viable backup. Lindback revealed finally that he had no place on our team let alone the NHL and that was Bens opportunity. Bishop made the most of it and elevated himself and his name around the league as a solid number posting stick handling goaltender. I say this time and again elite players players that are truly great have durability. Its a dimension thats overlooked. Look at Ovi. He stays healthy. Look at Schneider. He stays healthy. Look at Stamkos. Doesnt stay healthy. Look at Bishop. Doesnt stay healthy. Fuck even Crosby has had a bit of injury issues but he is definitely rebounding. A dimension in being a great player is staying healthy and being there for your team. Injuries happen but injuries to Ben happen at the WRONG time. In my mind that makes him a liability and if Vasy can stay healthy and post similar numbers Vasy is the more elite goaltender. ,TampaBayLightning,demv8hi,16,t5_2rqi8
