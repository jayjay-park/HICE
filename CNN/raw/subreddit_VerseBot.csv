906969,0,t1_ch7dma0,Psalms  NIVgtPsalm  A psalm of David. The Lord is my shepherd I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me beside quiet waters he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his names sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley I will fear no evil for you are with me your rod and your staff they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Source Code Feedback Contact Dev FAQ Changelog,VerseBot,ch7dmgf,1,t5_2y40i
