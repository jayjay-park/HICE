8419968,0,t3_4uuldr,The only symptoms I had were whoosing in my ears and what I referred to as head rushes periods of dizzy spellspressure in my head when I would move too quickly or get up from laying down. I figured the same  it was likely high blood pressure or related to being overweight... something to that effect. My eye doctor found the nerve swelling during a routine eye exam and asked if I had regular headaches... nope. Not even pressure behind the eyes? I mean sometimes but it was nothing to write home about. Most of the time I figured Id just spent too much time staring at screens. They did tell me though that the disease comes and goes in waves. You mention that lately it seems like the whooshing is getting more frequent which might mean that its still fairly mild but the pressure could be increasing. You may start to notice other symptoms as well that youd previously written off or not its a funny illness so being thorough and getting the LP is probably in your best interest. Catch it before it gets worse you know?My neuroophthalmologist found that while my vision is largely unaffected and shes confident it never will be my blind spots are a little bit bigger than they should be so the swelling has done a little damage even though I didnt really have many red flag symptoms. Since being on diamox the whooshing has stopped which thank god because it is incredibly annoying and I dont have the pressuredizziness nearly as often. Diamox does suck at first  the pins and needles in the feet and fingers was the worst part but it does subside after a while.As for the LP its scarier in your mind than it is in practice. No its not a walk in the park but you can definitely get through it. Make sure you lay down as much as possible over the two days or so after it. I didnt find the pressure headaches incredibly painful just... uncomfortable. Again it does go away and ultimately my pressures went down after the LP so it helped in the long run. Good luck!,iih,d5u1ez6,1,t5_2wk01

Im having optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery in April to prevent any further loss of vision. I just turned . I hate this disease. Its taken my life away and made me a shell of my former self.
