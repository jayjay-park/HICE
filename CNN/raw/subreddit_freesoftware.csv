Its an attempt to take the decentralized Ripple network and decentralize it further and reduce the reliance on a scarce currencyXRP as originally envisioned would have been cheap for human beings but if  of them get held for their value this wasnt really the case as much as it could have been STR lose value with time so there isnt as much of an incentive to hold them.People suddenly care because major players are finally starting to realize that Ripple was a good idea all along even if the people who are currently running the network used their monopoly over implementation of that idea as any monopolist would by extracting rent via value of XRP.,freesoftware,cjhpy2e,1,t5_2qhx9

3155578,0,t3_2w6rs0,You know you can get music through bittorrent but Ill warrant you still buy music. You also may pay to attend the occasional concert. Have you ever supported someone on patreon or gittip even if their product is free webcomics etc? I have.Ever paid for a humble bundle? Why did you pay?Dont fret about download metrics. If you choose to respect users freedoms youll suddenly have access to the number of people who dont pay. They would exist anyway youre just able to see them now. All systems have parasites. Focus instead on the loyal customers who do pay.Do some research into what converts nonpaying people into customers its been done. Humble are masters at this donations of  of purchases to charity often increase net profit from sales more than the charitable margin. Saying pay what you can yields more than pay what you like if you go that route. Making leaderboards of customers or offering ingame recognition of customers not bonuses which disenfranchise potential customers but stars next to usernames etc reminds existing nonpayers that the game they keep playing has more loyal and supportive users than them.What sells products isnt secrecy its customer loyalty. You should focus everything on making happy community members and making it clear to them that your success translates to continued development of things they want.BTW if you do this Ill totally jump aboard as will many FS advocates but dont bother marketing freedom put a link in your page footers or faq but I have learned that marketing freedomopenness doesnt on its own help for the mass of users out there. They dont care yet though things are changing. Youll win the trust of existing users with sources and freedom and youll encourage a great moddingpluginporting scene but pick another game trait to market upon.,freesoftware,cop2nnk,2,t5_2qhx9

6216046,0,t3_40nhpl,I evaluated reddits JavaScript for the FSFs Free JavaScript Campaign over a year ago.  It was unfortunately not yet released the FSF has a lot going on I should bring it up again.  I went through each combined JS file served to the client and correlated it with the original source files to determine what was committed to the repository.  I did not check for nonobvious code differences.The result of the evaluation at that time was that the combined JavaScript files were largely Free but did contain some small proprietary bits.  At the time those were Adzerk injection code and a small module that checks r.config.cursed and randomly moves objects under the mouse cursor. The repository was also missing some code used on the About page.The blog was also a massive concernit included stuff from YouTube Google Analytics Blogger Google and more over MiB of JS!.  But the blog was not a concern for the evaluation as it was a separate site from reddit itself.Some of these things may or may not be an issue today.  Zak Rogoff was having some discussion with them and may have provided them with my evaluation that was the intent but I dont recall where we left off. ,freesoftware,cyw74lb,5,t5_2qhx9

8240303,0,t1_d57jt8j,Just to give you so support. It took me a good  years to get entirely off proprietary softwareformats.I could not tell you just how many times I ran back to OSXWindows simply because it was convenient. But each time I would just feel a bit more empty towards it once you have had freedom you start to value that over all the flashy stuff. It is sort of like the movie The Matrix sometimes you just want to be plugged back in and forget you ever discovered your prison. But once you are out for good it is liberating. Once you have  been free for a long time I do slightly encourage people to eventually jump back to proprietary just for a little while. The walls of the prison are so obvious the restrictions on what you do become so obvious especially on file formats.While it is hard at first the pay off is worth it knowing that there are no restrictions other than dont make proprietary software. Like going vegetarianvegan at first you crave the old ways but once in your new ways you look back on your old self in a puzzled way. How did I ever live like that?I use Trisquel.

8845302,0,t1_d73w5e3,The problem is when you invite RMS to speak and I have seen him live and Ill be honest hes .. not the best speaker he represents the FSF and says he does.  So when he starts on a thirty minute screaming and fussing fit about your company having Linux in its name or company literature but not having GNULinux there and you literally have to remove the materials from the room before he will speak theres a problem.  When he gets off tangent and starts yelling at people for having children present because childbearers  breeders as hes called them are ruining the planet thats a problem.   When he smells so badly that the people in the front row cant think straight and the people in the back cant hear him and dont want to move up thats a problem.  Now I know the FSF is not going to reject evangelism because a company accidentally let someone see Linux without the GNU and I know the FSF does not officially rebuke breeders as ruining the world and I know that the FSF does not officially advocate not bathing not cleaning your clothes etc but this IS the face of the FSF and this IS the front line.   It is very hard to tell what the FSFs official position is or isnt when the figurehead does not know how to behave in public.,freesoftware,d7b2w2p,3,t5_2qhx9

Which is sacrificing freedom for convenience I admit. However I must confess id do it in a heartbeat too on my laptop if networkmanager couldnt drive my atheros wifi card either.I look forward to using replicant on my phone one day but in the interim it honestly sounds too rough to be my daily driver. . might fix a lot of that but its also not clear when the stable release of . is going to land.,freesoftware,dbj4umi,1,t5_2qhx9
