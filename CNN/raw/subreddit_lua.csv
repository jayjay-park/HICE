720474,0,t1_cgm5jd3,Sorry I thought the FS library has the function but it doesnt. The easiest way to do it is just copy it using reads and writes.  Maybe theres a library that has copy  I didnt find it yet.Or call OS for that  dont do it.Edit It seems that Im wrong over and over again,lua,cgm665z,3,t5_2qjla
1020806,0,t3_25q3mw,btw when doing operations involving remainders its better to use whole integers than decimals. Otherwise thingsthat are not powers of two like  centavos will introduce annoying rounding errors.If I were you I would represent money as its amounts in centavos instead of as its amount in reais.,lua,chkbmee,1,t5_2qjla
1231521,0,t1_ci84biy,As much as I love vim I dont think its a good choice for a newbie... learning how to program is complex enough. On a Mac Id try Sublime or TextMate and move to a more powerful editor only when you feel the need for it. ,lua,ci85w30,3,t5_2qjla
1644390,0,t1_cjmfc7v,In order to convert the string to a number you might do something like    local choice  tonumberio.readlineAlso it can be helpful to separate data like all of that text from your code. You can do this by putting it in a table    leveldialogue         getname  Hi there! Whats your name?       introsetting  nnnn You are currently in the castle named ...        other text    and then your code looks more like     printleveldialogue.getname     local name  io.readlinewhich makes it a little easier where to find something that has gone wrong since the dialogue text will not break your program.        ,lua,cjmftpd,2,t5_2qjla

2012854,0,t1_ckvfkia,They dont have a value necessarily the memory address you see when printing them is just so you can identify them. The way lua is structured the userdata may just be a pointer or be the actual data. I think you should instead be looking at what operations the userdata actually has like robin suggested.And why are you doing this anyway? Theres few cases where youd need to check something like this is there not a better way?,lua,ckvquwe,2,t5_2qjla
2849330,0,t3_2sqo2b,Autor outlines the memory limits in LuaJIT and presents a nice solution for GB memory limit which at the end brings him to a very fast and superior comparing to other languages solution.

3759622,0,t1_cqksp3e,Penlight seems pretty useful. The section seems purely about using such things for packages though.

4548648,0,t3_3cl8g2,Why not just use a function that returns a function if you need multiple instances of the same one? Or does this have to be a more general solution?Excellent article by the way. Provides insight into areas of the standard library I havent used before.,lua,ct3zcb8,1,t5_2qjla

Because in your version you have  string.format calls and  concatinations. I have one string.format call and it does the same.Furthermore is spotted this here    CurrentTime  .You probably mean  but I still recommend using the numbers for comparison.

7794463,0,t1_d3rg610,gt Notice how were talking about OpenFL there a game framework and not Haxe itself? Understood but Im writing a game that I need people to be able to play in the browser using JavaScript. My next games may use a similar stack if this one sees any success. So do I need to use a JavaScriptoptimized game library and drive it from Haxe? Im using Cocosdjshtml at the moment and TypeScript has been a convenient way to drive it.It does sound like Haxe has come a long way. Ill have to take a look at it again after my current project is stable. Thanks again for the info.,lua,d3s5mlv,1,t5_2qjla

9875449,0,t1_dau7oqf,Yeah... this module will cause either  disk usage or  CPU usage depending on whether the OS caches the file modification time in RAM or not and will prevent your program from being able to do anything else while its running. This is a a terrible waste of resources. I would only use this if I needed something like this for a quick hacky script and even then it would be less hassle do just write my own while loop.,lua,dauslhv,2,t5_2qjla
9995640,0,t1_db9tv6i,Lua is all about being fast though and the colon syntax has no overhead    objruneffectively becomes    local TEMP  obj    TEMP.runTEMPYour way is going to cause a closure to be allocated every time you call a method which will also increase the amount of objects that later need collecting by the GC. Furthermore it is slower to load properties when index is a function than when it is a table.,lua,dbagklp,1,t5_2qjla
