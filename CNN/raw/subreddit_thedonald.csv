Literally every gas station retail store and warehouse in my town needs people who arent too proud read entitled to do the job. They are not lowering compensation by taking a minimum wage job they are lowering compensation because they will work for anything and have no rights as they are not citizens. And guess what would bolster tax revenue? More tax paying citizens. Have you seen how hard it is to become a citizen? I am not saying to just hand out free citizenship and I  support the background checks. But right now it takes thousands of dollars and YEARS to become a citizen.

10563922,0,t3_5r8kep,Im assuming by latest policies your focusing on the immigration restriction. Im throwing this up inbetween classes so I apologize for errors but I just wanted to give my quick wrap of the ban. Im not the biggest fans of punishing the majority for the actions of a minority but I believe it is unarguably the most efficient method to stop a problem. One of the main things that is most likely going to take place after this  immigration reconstruction period is background checks. The requirements for them are minimal. Most tourist visas dont require them at all. And even things like green cards do require them  ask you for them from your local government. This is a problem because all of the seven countries that are currently banned from entering the us are all on a list produced by the Obama administration of states that fund terrorism. I dont think it will hurt to have a better structured immigration system even if in  years it only prevents  san Bernadino cant we agree it was worth waiting  days? And to Address the people concerned about a Muslim ban. I believe this is and is not a Muslim ban. The ban does not specifically target Muslims as  most populated majority Muslim countries are still welcome to send people to the us. Of course though this is a ban on terrorism and the unprogressive ideologies of Islam does have a correlation with terrorism.,thedonald,dd5jg98,2,t5_2ve48

10643160,0,t1_dddihq4,Unfortunately fracking is much too expensive a process to withstand low oil prices.  If you depress the price of oil you end up running the fracking industry out of business.  Fracking requires a price of over  per barrel to be profitable.  So if you depress the price to where it is now around  or lower you end up forcing dozens of fracking operations to shut down which has already happened all over the US since mid due to the plunge in oil prices.  Depressing the oil price forces the US to produce less oil and to buy more oil from foreign producers.We have to understand too that US oil companies hate how Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations flood the market with cheap oil which costs them only  to  per barrel to produce.  In the US conventional oil costs around  to produce while the fracking process costs around  a barrel to produce.  In the past couple of years there has been a glut of oversupply of oil coming out of the middle east which has caused the oil price to fall from  a barrel in June of  to less than  a barrel by late .  This plunge in the oil price hurt US oil companies badly forcing many to shut down wells which were losing money.This is yet another reason why US oil companies want to invade the middle east so they can get access to cheap oil in cheap labor countries and lower their cost of production.  Also by controlling oil fields in the middle east US companies would be able to reduce the production of oil at their more expensive US oil fields lowering their costs even more as well as lowering the supply of oil on the market thereby driving up the price of oil back to the  per barrel range resulting in greater profits for them.Notwithstanding that you are missing the main point of my article.  The US is going to war against Iran and Trump is going to lead us there.  Follow the news.  Its right in front of our eyes.,thedonald,dddrduh,1,t5_2ve48
