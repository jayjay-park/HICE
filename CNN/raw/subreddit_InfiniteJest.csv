5285085,0,t1_cvmxm3p,In attempt to answer my own question maybe Wallace thought of Gabor as the creator of virtual reality  a technology that made him deeply apprehensive. If thats the case perhaps the character who makes the everythings projected comments is Wallaces example of the fractured paranoid state and wild accusations that can result from living with projected modern technologies like tv internet mobile phones etc.,InfiniteJest,cvn8c8l,2,t5_2rwyg
5579857,0,t3_3rgthe,The Anxiety of Influence By the time he was writing Infinite Jest Wallace had made a name as part of a generation of young fiction writers. He complains loudly though optimistically in the Fictional Futures essay about the station of his particular generation one weighed down by marketing and high expectations by MFAprogrammanufactured standards of good fiction and by the need to distinguish and establish their own voices and styles separate from their forefathers and mothers. The novel he eventually wrote in response to this is fraught with generational tension primarily those in which the young are torn between emulating and resisting the influence of their predecessors. The Hamlet references peeking through call attention to the good old Oedipal issues of both detesting and wanting to be your parent. It also allows Wallace to perform the concept he is writing about.  James Incandenzas alcoholic father  who has failed in the eyes of his own father  bullies JOI into playing tennis. JOI turns around and himself an alcoholic starts a tennis academy for his own son and others. Hal excels at tennis the same way his predecessors had but once he starts speaking in own voice in the firstperson chapters toward the end of the book he debates whether he wants to play. JOIs brilliance and experimental arts appears to represent a prior generation of experimental writers the influences with whom the next generation must find a way to both converse with and surpass. Orin Incandenza stands as a failure to escape the shadow of his elders. Once a tennis player he becomes a punter a guy whose whole only job is to hand the ball over to the other team. Its essentially a passive uncreative role and one that he excels at. A similar thing happens for Orin in the bedroom where he is focused on pleasing his subjects but not himself i.e. on being entertaining.  Orin is so obsessed with his father that he eventually becomes little more than an imitator the keeper of the Master Copy.  By the end he is made to cheesily reenact a scene from  voicing nothing original at all. Finally there is The Entertainment.  James Incandenza created The Entertainment to try and draw Hal out of his isolation to make sure he didnt become a silenced figurant in his own life.  He felt that Hal was going mute and wanted to give him back a voice. But it didnt work and instead he made a movie so entertaining that it sapped the voice of anyone who watched it. This is of course the extreme version of what Wallace fears in EUP. It also fits into the what you love in this life kills you half of JOIs cosmology and the novels addiction narratives. The second part about what kills you mothers you in the next life fits with the artistic development process in which a writer will emulate his or her influences and then with effort and pain abandon them to create a new voice. Something like that.The Tennis Styles  In Fictional Futures Wallace wrote at length about the styles of fiction that had occupied the labors of his generation and the institutionalization via MFA programs of what made for good or successful fiction.  John No Relation Waynes tennis abilities are reminiscent of the technically proficient writers who succeed in their own mechanical way and his stark efficiency may even reflect Wallaces objection to the cult of minimalism or Bad Carver as he put it in his generations writing.  Mike Pemulis has a deadly and accurate lob but has not developed his game beyond that one trick. Lamont Chus obsession with being a famous tennis player is preventing him from playing his best game.  Troelstch is obsessed with giving commentary on other peoples matches. Schacht has resigned himself to not playing pro and wants to be a dentist. Substitute writing for tennis game and you have a list of common anxieties and behaviors in any American creative writing program. As for Hal his tennis style is essentially no style. Being smart seeing vulnerabilities and drawing his opponents into errors. Like Orin he plays passively. Hal also worries that after a rapid ascent he has plateaued in his game. He must feel similar to say a young writer who published a celebrated novel he wrote as an undergraduate and is stuck wondering if he will ever develop beyond his current level.Mark LeynerMike Pemulis In EUP Wallace focuses his attention on image fiction author Mark Leyner and his book My Cousin My Gastroenterologist citing the jacket copy that calls the book a fiction analogue of the best drug you ever took. Leyner reacts to TV by fully absorbing and recreating it in fiction.  Wallaces analysis of the book is respectful of Leyners abilities and intelligence but ultimately dismayed that it is does nothing. His discussion is also full of drug references methedrine compound of pop pastiche bad acid trip amphetaminic eagerness.  In a  interview Wallace referred to Leyner as a kind of antichrist saying If the purpose of art is to show people how to live then its not clear how he does this.  Michael Pemulis Hals closest friend is an extraordinarily capable and brilliant kid. Hes a smartassed prank playing math whiz who is the master of a game that simulates the end of the world. He is also the novels main source of drug knowledge and substance.  As noted his tennis technique he has one good trick the high lob. Pemulis urges Hal to try more drugs in order to fix his unhappiness which is roughly Lerners approach Make fiction look more like television in order to get off the TV fix. In a  interview Wallace would refer to Pemulis as one of the books Antichrists.partial analysis from here ,InfiniteJest,cwoqejm,12,t5_2rwyg

7854633,0,t1_d3yu9in,First off rockets are extremely inefficient so a whole lot of fuel would get wasted. Given that our most pressing problem is global warming this would cause more problems than it solves. Now maybe it would still be worthwhile to spend the fuel to dispose of nuclear waste if that allowed us to switch to nuclear power everywhere.But the second problem is the dangers associated with rocket launches. Even with everything we have learned rockets still explode upon launch from time to time. If a rocket loaded with nuclear waste exploded it would be spread all of that waste all throughout the air as nuclear fallout and affect millions of people. So again this makes the problem worse not better.And I havent even mentioned cost in any of this. Given the fuel requirements and technical expertise required rocket programs are also very expensive. For the same price we could do any number of more sensible things.,InfiniteJest,d3yxjpa,2,t5_2rwyg

Instead whenever he comes across an endnote a female voice will announce the number so you can refer to the book if you need to. Oh and his Joelle voice is absolutely god awful.All in all he reads it very well and I would highly recommend it for a second read through. ,InfiniteJest,db92f1d,1,t5_2rwyg

I also just finished my second read of IJ and I would say that he nailed it perfectly. He describes many types of people in varying stages of addiction who have varying views on AA and recovery and I cant think of anything he omitted or got wrong. Ive never read another novel with so much detail on recovery in America but I cant see how anyone could have done it any better. My favorite section is the one regarding the exotic new facts one learns upon entering treatment for addiction  Im laughing out loud and holding back tears with every sentence. ,InfiniteJest,dgqo92s,2,t5_2rwyg
