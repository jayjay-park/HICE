270355,0,t3_1x2fm2,The way that I see it. The FP portion of the game is not competitive unless you are going for world first achievements but those always go to the most dedicated players so I assume that you wouldnt be worried about that if you are looking for a casual FP. The PvP portion of the game is completely pay to win as you will be unable to grind for pvp cards.   There will be a Wild West format in which you could use the pve cards that you have unlocked in pvp but otherwise pve cards are not allowed in pvp.,hextcg,cf8s6l8,1,t5_2x6sl
271982,0,t1_cf8xoit,Sure. The Keep system as a whole is sort of a personal base for your character. Purportedly youll be able to upgrade it as you play though whether those upgrades are merely cosmetic or confer some mechanical benefit isnt addressed.What we do know is that there are plans to introduce a Keep Defense game mode. The idea is that you as the owner of a Keep will voluntarily store some of your ingame currency in your Keeps vault. You then create three decks which will serve as defenders of that vault. Any player can by paying an ante challenge your vaults defenders pitting their single deck against each of the three defending decks. If they beat all three defending decks consecutively they succeed in raiding the vault and get some all? of the cash inside. If they fail however the owner of the Keep gets the ante with part of it being automatically redeposited in the Keeps vault. The belief is that this will lead to the creation of really strong threedeck combinations that require superb constructed play to beat and that the most impenetrable vaults will become wellknown with large vault prizes and lots of people trying to plunder them.,hextcg,cf8y9i9,2,t5_2x6sl

1037400,0,t3_25zhzh,CopyPaste from siteHEX UPDATE  FROM CORYMay  To our family of HEX supportersI have been chasing a dream for the last three years a dream to produce an innovative trading card game a game that combines the strategy of a TCG with the community and progression of an MMO. Something amazing and new something you would love. We presented that dream to you our community and you responded with such mindblowing support to help us launch HEX.Sadly the potential of that innovation has driven WOTC to file a meritless lawsuit in an attempt to kill a competitor before it delivers on that promise.  HEX has a chance to give gamers a better and completely different experience from a digitalonly TCG than a paper TCG can. Sometimes being small and independent makes you seem like an easy target to the bullies and thats not an easy place to be but rest assured we are ready to defend the dream.Yes WOTC and its even larger parent Hasbro are much bigger than Hex Entertainment.  But the size of their bank accounts doesnt make them right and we will fight to deliver the game that you supported throughout this journey.  We will not allow this frivolous legal action to damage our ability to deliver a quality game experience to you.I appreciate the outpouring of support on our forums and I can understand the need to speculate on the specifics of the case. Clearly I cannot address these posts in detail but rest assured we have retained legal counsel that is very experienced in these types of matters and I feel  confident in a positive outcome for HEX. I will say that its important for the HEX community to remember we are all part of the same tribe. We are all gamers so even if someone isnt into HEX please treat them with kindness and respect. We must all stick together as a tribe gamers have it hard enough as it is without tearing each other down.I will not allow the dream we shared as a community to be crushed. You believed in me made the Kickstarter an amazing success and stuck by us as we slogged through the alpha client. It is unfortunate that this hurdle has been thrust upon us. But we will prevail we have come too far to let the dream die now.Lastly I must ask that you respect the obligations of the HEX team members during this time and direct all questions or comments to myself and legal at legalhextcg.com.  We will read all inquires but remember that because of the nature of this situation we may not be able to respond at this time.  But we will continue to keep all of you our fans and support apprised of the developments as we have strived to do so from the very beginning.Thank youCory Jones and HEX team,hextcg,chm7h6g,8,t5_2x6sl

So  weeks of work in  months. This year Christmas lands in such a way that there are  weeks of work in December BUT making major changes to the game like Arena and then taking an extended holiday is not in the best interest of the game so Arena should come early in the month so they have some quality time with it before the holidays.,hextcg,clsu1w0,2,t5_2x6sl

Still kinda weird that youre saying what you can spend your free time on.Depending on your cell phone you could always do tethering. Hex isnt an especially bandwidth heavy game once youre actually playing. I moved recently and was without internet for like two weeks playing via a tethered G connection was basically an identical experience.I would say if you plan to do that long term it would benefit to to have a laptop so you could use WiFi at a restaurant or something to download the patches and initial client. Since most unlimited data plans actually have a limit of  gigs of data per month. Not that Hex alone will hit the limit but extra gigs are way expensive.Or tunneling software may just be the pro play if you use a desktop or cant access free tethering on your phone.,hextcg,clv5cyh,2,t5_2x6sl

Part of me wonders whether it was a bad design decision to make Gorefeast work all troops because it could be included in any deck which has easy zerg options say with FalconerStorm Cloud. If the Rage  modifier had been restricted to say Orcs or troops of a single shard colour which you choose when the spell is cast I wonder if it might be better.

I have yet to see any logical reason suggested as to why those  tiers deserve this gift while no one else including those who bought higher tiers which included those tiers does.Here are some alternative methods they could have chosen to achieve the same goal of maintaining the same draft firing rate Reduce the entry cost of drafts Each week give X random players a free draft ticket Give new players one or more free draft tickets Distribute the free draft tickets among players based on some objective criteria such as total money spent Add additional prizes to draft queues such as a new exclusive AAThats just off the top of my head.

The construct foreman gives you more  drop dwarfs to assist with flooding the board and also helps to beef up your blocking squad against early aggression. Hex Geodes assist with quickly hitting your threshold counts and give you another target for construct foreman which in turn gives you more robots for the plans.I also added in some burns and verdicts to remove some annoying early threats and block against possible board clears.

I can sympathise with the desire for credentials but your suggested method of assessing quality is pretty crummy if thats the case.Place your faith in the staff of shards in their ability to choose for themselves who has the credentials necessary to be featured on their site.That said I agree with your example in terms of quality but I think thats more down to how the cards were scored than the person writing it. Problem is they broke stuff down into too granular a metric of quality which lead to lots of s because rarely is a card going to be so poor in every category and likewise rarely is a card going to be great at every category.

5028061,0,t1_cur8iuf,I rate Gronts Gift usually high but still depending on what ive opened. The att gem or the mill one like in the first deck is incredible once you pull off but it is quite slow and can run you out of tempo. I think it is weak vs aggro but strong vs late game. Since most of the decks that ppl are building are aggro i think that it is very hard to play correctly. When it hits though it hits hard. IMO its a very fun card to play its well designed and has a lot of synergy overall with different deckschamps.Reaver in a token deck is a bit ackward. I actually played  rounds when i was up  in the sealed and there was some weird situations where I had Reaver in hand but a board full of spiders a priest and  eremite. It was basically a dead card in my hand because i would just clear my own board. In another round tho it saved my life since the board was cleared and was the solo creature on the playing field.For PoF I like to have AT LEAST  but preferably  or more cards that triggers it. The whole point of the card is to be able to profit from it otherwise its a dead card.I love coyotle as well and TBH i wasnt confident in doing a trishard deck with my pool. Im sure it would be possible to whip up something playable. I like to have at least  fixing cards when i play trishard and I only had  shardcall. I sometimes do dual with a splash for a bomb but thats a bit different. With the aggresive nature of the format I think that trishard is daring but very faisable. ex you open a windsinger. a lunapaw and a dreamsmoke mystic.

6321789,0,t1_cz85504,I think you misunderstood me I did not say that the short time to reconnect was because the game state could be serialized. Of course it is there for PvP reasons. What I am saying is that because the time to reconnect is short there is no need for serialization in the first place. The reconnection feature can work perfectly fine for PvP without any serialization.I looked at the link you pasted and this is exactly what I am talking about Unity offers some support for serialization out of the box but you have to write custom code to handle certain situations. The following bit seems relevant to the targeting example I gave earlier If you populate the animals array with three references to a single Animal object in the serialization stream you will find  objects. when its deserialized there are now three different objects. If you need to serialize a complex object graph with references you cannot rely on Unitys serializer doing that all automagically for you and have to do some work to get that object graph serialized yourself.,hextcg,cz87uvu,2,t5_2x6sl

Commander isnt usually a relevant format in tourney play in MtG should we get of it as well?

9589930,0,t1_d9ubg86,I cannot agree with your first point.If you look at the Risks and Challenges section of the Kickstarter you can read the following We have built a series of deliverables that we believe can be completed in the remaining development time we have scheduled.  We have tested the game systems and feel confident everything will socket together and create a fantastic experience. Further game testing is of critical importance and we have planned for a staggered beta phase that will allow us to polish the experience and catch all the bugs this is will include both private and public testing.There is absolutely no mention of another company being involved. If Cryptozoic had done its due diligence by auditing and properly testing the code it should not have taken long to figure out that the project was far from completion. I am left with the impression that none of this was done in order to beat everybody else to the market and capture the biggest possible audience for the product. An unrealistic delivery schedule was put forward for the same reason. It is not inconceivable if Cryptozoic was aware of Blizzards plan with Hearthstone at the time.The sole purpose of the Risks and Challenges section is to provide this type of details to backers so that they can make an informed decision. A possible lawsuit by WotC should also have been listed in this section If the court filings revealed anything it is that Cryptozoic had sought legal counsel and was clearly aware of this risk. If project creators do not disclose this type of information in that section thhey are lying to potential backers if only by omission. This is false advertisement and there is simply no excuse for that no matter how you look at it.The best parallel I can find to this situation is No Mans Sky Both games were hyped beyond reason prior to release both have been released with lots of bugs both are still missing a ton of features and it is not clear whenif those features are coming.

10784198,0,t3_5u7hnp,Rotation means people who started playing later will catch up for Standard. Thats good.Might be the first set I actualy brew my own deck. Ive been thinking I want to start spending more in the game but the fact that its got so many features in development still stops me from doing so.Immortal will be fun to watch. I hope more people take up streaming.The cards themselves add many new elements in Constructed not so many in Limited. Aggro will still be the way to go the distribution of successful shards will just change.I have to say though my only gripe is that they introduced so many new keywords its kinda ridiculous. Not that Im afraid theyll run out of ideas for the future but Id draw the line at  new keywords and not even every set.,hextcg,ddsb82d,1,t5_2x6sl

10954882,0,t1_de9v2gh,I think Frasaria is correct. I dont have the game open to check now but I believe you conduct your draw before the free troops are taken out of your deck.  So when you are drawingmulliganining there are still four copies in your deck. After you lock in your hand if there are any  cost rares remaining in your deck not in your hand then they will be pulled from your deck and played for free.,hextcg,de9x2ae,3,t5_2x6sl

11082153,0,t3_5xxgro,I dont understand. How is this different than people using the plat to buy packs selling the packs for money then having the buyer of the packs to resell them for plat?In the end the seller still basically sold plat and the buyer bought plat. The only thing this affects is that now HXE gets a cut from the AH.,hextcg,deo5hnv,1,t5_2x6sl
11158870,0,t1_dews450,Destroy with void from hand and deck. Its says enough.  I dont have problem with its power though problem is that there is no many viable options. If there is any. Maybe control Saphire with something to cancel or discards cards. ,hextcg,dewugof,1,t5_2x6sl
11187357,0,t3_5zq4df,the deck went    overall during the ccs weve met with future though so its rather  then the most interestingtenselucky match was round  vs metronomy that managed to play vs all  of us running this uzzu in rounds . SORRY AGAIN DUDE.in draft i failed to read that sapphire is getting cut a lot proceeded to still try to draft it... and then  people appeared to have it in maindeck... shouldve live the dream and start taking  gargs at the very start even as a singleton its a huge blocker but my pp rare spoilt me. gg Urshulgi for catching em allaccording round  of draft i had dc and failed to reconnect in game  which i would lose most likely. in game  i got punched in the face by such a quality and fun mechanic  conscript.ill add the videos to the playlist once i figure how to cut the audio off because i was really saltyenjoy,hextcg,df02nvd,3,t5_2x6sl
11193540,0,t1_df0oye0,gt A note on Moshpit Gladiator I think the card is fine though there are a lot of ways to ose tempo with him in a standard midrange deck. However for the reasons outlined above I dont think the card is very good in most drafts and I would pick an average drop over it most of the time.I disagree with this. I view moshpit as a fantastic top end bomb. The DS deck basically cant block it most games and it is a removal or die threat they have a hard time racing.Hard for me to jump to each pick without time stamps so not sure I have too many specifics on such a wall of text.gt I dont find you can  reliably drafting any other way.You are never going to reliably  drafting no matter how good you are. Not how variance games work.,hextcg,df0rw57,1,t5_2x6sl
11195242,0,t1_deyorvc,Sure but that doesnt mean the problem doesnt also exist in limited. The statement was when Im playing Limited I expect to be heavily affected by the luck factor which you took exception to not when Im playing Limited much more so than Constructed I expect to be heavily affected by the luck factor.,hextcg,df0ytxp,1,t5_2x6sl

11215743,0,t3_6008kv,The game is more complex than most CCG out there.  As for the learning there is  different things. First Is learning how the mechanics work and second is learning everything you can do in Hex which can be overwhelming for someone Thst needs to learn both I strongly suggest to start with the campaign and have fun. With the packs and gold you get you can play totally free on the pve side Next if you like to be more competitive and play against people you will have two choices either limited or constructed. If you want to spend the less possible and have the most fun I would suggest constructed. Look up Jeff hoogland budget deck for hex and it will cost you  to . The cool thing in hex is from there you have a ton of options to play for free and gain stuff  playing ladder will give you gold and around  booster packs freely. If you can keep top  you qualify for the ccs for free and get a chance of that  all for free  fiveshard weekly  mostly toubaments free. It lets you go for a chance of  in plat everyweek and some boosters. Again for free  five. Shards arcalum vault. Another weekly free tournament that gives you cool AA and some boosters  in April we have the again free platinum plunder. Its a change of getting first place and  worth of platinum. Again I cannot say enough for free So a small investment in hex can bring you alot of pleasure and alot of fun. And when you are tired you can sell your cards on the ah and buy other cards with little to no investment.  Its the best thing with  tcg If you prefer you could play limited but that might cost you more to learn as you need to pay each time but once you are good or have disposable income you can get pretty good and probably make the money back if your good. My ign is Portensio. Give me your ign and Ill send you a bunch of stuff to start your adventure in this wonderful game. Again something I can only do because its a tcg  ,hextcg,df3ahdw,1,t5_2x6sl

I havent liked the game on facebook unless i remember wrong i dont own a twitter account I rarely open the forum. I bought the plat ONCE the equivalent of  dollars if I remember correctly dividing the transaction to avoid getting scammed by the third party. I wouldnt have bought  dollars all in one transaction i bought  dollars worth of plat in  or  trances one after another all in the same day but just ONCE. ,hextcg,df8dzcf,3,t5_2x6sl

11316082,0,t1_dfeky6g,You are making a ton of assumptions before most people have even submitted decks.So far most submissions have been easily obtainable and all budget.  Not all optimized PvE decks require terribly expensive cards.  Thats unrealistically irrational.The starter deck issue is an entirely different conversation.  One Ive started on the main HEX forums if you are interested in continuing the conversation there on it Ill link here for youEveryone that plays PvE has different end game goals.  Perhaps someone wants all their characters to have the best possible deck they can make before the next Adventure zone comes out?  Whos to say that is unproductive?,hextcg,dfenr8e,4,t5_2x6sl

11475300,0,t1_dfworub,Well but there never was much advertising for the game I think that getting it on steam was more advertising for it than the devspulisher ever did themselves. Also I doubt many people actually care or even know about how much steam cuts from profits.I am strictly speaking about people who are discovering the game through steam. Steams audience is a lot larger than anything else when it comes to digital games so one could assume that much more players notice the game through steam than anything else.I personally backed the game but changed immediately to the Steam client when it was available there. Mostly because I am lazy and like the quality of life stuff steam gives. Thus I also have like  or more games there.To be honest it seems to me that mostly people who stayed from the begining with this game are claiming that most people play with the standalone client and they often base it on how many people in their friend list are playing with the nonsteam one. Which is kinda obvious as many of those friends are probably also playing since before the Steam client.,hextcg,dfwpyje,1,t5_2x6sl

11570109,0,t1_dg7g4ek,If youre refering the trick he used moving his graveyard before his opponent announced the spell trigger in order to mindgame his opponent to completely forget the trigger then he didnt part ways from the team due to that. If you read Cardhoarders announcement at that point they say that they dont think this consistuted a violation worthy to kick him. ESPECIALY if you consider his side of the story went like I did remove the graveyard thinking that hed declare the trigger but when he didnt and the game progressed I realised his mistake and placed my graveyard back in place. If I was boxing and my opponent tripped on his own feet I wouldnt let him to have a freebie on me because he mightve if he hadnt tripped. Cardhoarders actualy said that they were keeping him on the team despite people overreacting and saying theyd stop supporting their store.The reasons they parted were not stated explicitly stated other than that people had send the team info on Ketter misbehaving unspecified.,hextcg,dg7h7a3,1,t5_2x6sl
