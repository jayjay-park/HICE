1879,0,t1_ceencjz,To be fair it was a Christmas present. I WAS going to buy it within the next month or two anyway though. Zelda and Mario games are both superb and worth getting the console for. The couch coop for Mario is the kind of multiplayer I enjoy. Being next to the other player is what I know and love. Modern multiplayer is too distant and artificial for me to enjoy fully. I attribute it to a generational gap but there are a lot of people who share my opinion and Nintendo is the perfect platform for our types. Cant wait for Mario kart and smash. Maybe the next metroid game will be a cross between super metroid and these newer Mario iterations. A cooptional game with other hunters?,nintendo,ceenhrq,3,t5_2qhnk

21105,0,t3_1ub8ux,Because I dont mind paying what I feel is a fair price for a good product.  Sure there are games I have on my Wii or DS VCs that I could easily have emulated and have in the past.  But  for an NES game or  for an SNES game is a fair price to me.  Not every game on the VC is worth the price but Im happy to pay to play games that I enjoy.  I generally like Nintendo as a company while while they may not need my money at least not in the micro sense I dont mind giving it to them.  I figure that if VC games sell well we get more of them.  If a particular game sells very well maybe we get a brand new sequel or a revived series.  I dont have anything to back this up but Id be willing to bet that sales of old NES Mega Man games on the VC directly lead to the making of Mega Man  and .  Maybe if enough people buy Earthbound well get a new Mother game or at least localized versions of the Japanese sequels.  Im not opposed to emulation.  Ive emulated games that I now own on the VC.  I emulate games that arent available on the VC.  I play games I own on the VC on my work PC on virtualnes.com sometimes when Im bored.  There is nothing wrong with the idea of emulation but if there is a company I want to support that puts out a product I want to use at a price I feel is fair I will buy their product.That is why I buy games on the Virtual Console.  ,nintendo,cegu3qs,1,t5_2qhnk

If Disney wants to get into game consoles they would have a better chance at buying the Xbox division if the next MS CEO spins it off.I would like to see The Wonderful .

Try to play down the gimickiness of the system blowing on it and all that and just show how awesome it looks.  The system is a great system especially playing Zeldazombie umario but the problem is most people dont believe you when you tell them that.  It already has a foothold in those of us who adore oldschool Mario  zelda flashbacks so them making a commercial for us wouldnt be a good idea especially since its the superbowl and not Doctor who.,nintendo,cel9ben,1,t5_2qhnk

The last time I bought a Nintendo home console was the Gamecube. I dont want a Wii and I dont want a Wii U because I dont like the idea of traditional controllers being relegated to an optional accessory. Stop with the wiimotes stop with the gamepad stop with the gimmicks. These are the things that should be optional not the controller. Somewhere along the way Nintendo made a wrong turn at Albuquerque and they need to get back on track.I would also like to add that this is of course my opinion.

Also i never ever heard of anyone fighting for homebrew to be available on a platform and then protecting his code so much as to brick the console of a user because a third party is using his code without permission. if they wanted to make a homebrew card they could have made a homebrew only card. and if they fight for homebrew so much they should release their code and let people mess around with it. its very clear these guys are selling primarily a piracy tool and they are over protecting it.,nintendo,ceuasab,28,t5_2qhnk
139748,0,t3_1vokgq,I cant think of too many adventure games that dont involve dying but there are several games that involve beating a high score or level before time runs out or following a story that she might like. I dont know what shes more drawn to so Ill name a few games that are quite different from each other. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.I dont know what her sense of humor is but if she likes things like cutting bushes and blowing dandelions she might like Wario Ware. The DS game Wario Ware Touched and the Wii game Wario Ware Smooth Moves are good examples of turning simple tasks into minigames and while you can run out of lives its not technically dying just a high score that you try and beat the next time. The Wii U version is also fun but doesnt focus so much on the multiple x seconds long mini games element from the original series and instead has one longer minigames for each character. Some of the games can be a bit crude much like Wario himself and involve things like picking noses or uses peeing statues to put out a fire. I wouldnt recommend Wario Ware D.I.Y though. The whole appeal to that game is the ability to make your own games but if that doesnt interest you then the lack of build games adding new elements as the levels get higher in the minigames wont be enough to keep you. Its fun if youre interested in making games but not so much if youre wanting to play Wario Ware.The Cooking Mama series is similar in not dying but rather failing the level but it has really interesting use of the touch screen mechanics and the new ones add in mini games in addition to the cooking games to vary the gameplay more. Id recommend starting at the second cooking mama game if youve never tried the series. The first one was fine but it separated a lot of steps that didnt need to be separated like one step to slice an onion then another to dice the slices into tiny pieces or having separate steps for each vegetable. The second game on starting to put all the parts into one step.Then there are series like Phoenix Wright and Professor Layton to consider. Theres no dying in those except the victims in PW I suppose but they can be hard and are more story driven than some games. Theyre more like point and click adventures where you move room to room to investigate only without the element of picking up items to solve puzzles. PW uses the feature to investigate crime scenes so that you can defend your client in court while Layton involves solving multiple simple puzzles while slowly opening a broadening story. Rhythm games are another genre to think about. Games like Elite Beat Agents and Rhythm Heaven are relatively well known but EBA can be difficult to beat. EBA does have the appeal of using covers of well known songs which is good and matches the levels touch patterns really well. I mentioned that it can be difficult and the later levels can be. On the easiest mode I can barely beat the final level though I can beat most of the previous levels even on the hardest mode. I havent actually played Rhythm Heaven personally but watching videos on youtube makes it look fun but hard as well. I actually like a lesser known DS game called Gabrielles Ghostly Groove since its charming and doesnt require some of the insanely difficult timing that EBA does. It also adds collectibles like badges and cards and unlocks outfits hairstyles and accessories to dress your character up the way you like which if you like that kind of thing like I do can be a lot of fun in and of itself. Speaking of charming again the story can be a little young oriented but with characters like a terrified vampire a tsundere werewolf and a teddy bear mummy its good for a few chuckles. Speaking of dressing up theres also Style Savvy Trendsetters where you run a boutique. It involves buying and selling clothes and helping customers find what theyre needing as the main part of the game but it also involves participating in fashion shows. You have a list of styles with more to unlock to decorate your boutique which determines what kind of clientele will normally come in and what type of clothes you should keep in stock. For every piece of clothing you buy you get your own for personal use to you can expand the wardrobe and dress your character however you want which will encourage customers who like the same style to come in even if the store doesnt normally cater to that style. Its a bit cheesy but its surprisingly fun. There was a previous game on the DS but this one isnt connected though there are some references and has a lot of improvements. ,nintendo,ceuciaq,3,t5_2qhnk

327787,0,t3_1xud9k,There were a couple of good Retro courses shown off in the trailer.First off DK Jungle from Mario Kart . This course appears several times throughout the video  and  for example. In the clips you can clearly see the totems in the glide section near the end of the track and DK entering the Golden Banana Temple.Secondly we have Mario Circuit from Mario Kart Super Circuit. This one was harder to notice. At first I thought it was a Mario Circuit track from the original Mario Kart but from looking at maps of the tracks I can tell it is definitely from Super Circuit. Heres a side by side for proof. Ive rotated the map so you can see how it compares.Next up we have Grumble Volcano from Mario Kart Wii. As seen at  and  in the trailerAnd finally I think I can spot Tick Tock Clock from Mario Kart DS and possibly Toad Factory from Mario Kart Wii but Im not  on those.Add this to the ones we know from the first trailer Melody Motorway and Piranha Plant Pipeway from Mario Kart  and Dry Dry Desert from Mario Kart Double Dash and I think its safe to say that Mario Kart  is shaping up to be a great game and May th cant come soon enough!,nintendo,cfeqv2u,29,t5_2qhnk

You could either switch between them or with localonline co op and the pari could each have their particular strengths and fighting styles Zelda is after all a dab hand with a bow.

Basically it made what were the more boring parts of Zelda games rupees and collecting stuff much more interesting because the rewards were much greater than in previous games.

768724,0,t1_cgqxoe3,Kirby  The Crystal Shards was the game that introduced me to Kirby and remains my favorite of the series and yes its because of mixing the copy abilities. I didnt particularly care that most of them were hard to use I just used them for the novelty and because it often created a new challenge. Im always so sad when a new Kirby game comes out and you cant mix abilities... Also the slow movement never really bothered me.I enjoyed Yoshis Story though my cartridge is old and hard to play now so Ive never thoroughly beaten it. I bought Other M thinking there was NO WAY it could possibly be as bad as the Internet made it out to be... I played it for five minutes and put it down. Have not turned it on ever since. I feel like a terrible person for not giving it a little more of a shot but really I just cant bring myself to play any more. The graphics feel like a step back even from the first Metroid Prime and there was far too much dialogue within the first few scenes for a game series about isolation and exploration. Twilight Princess is one of my favorite Zelda games though the collection sequences repeated unfortunately in Skyward Sword were rather boring. Combat was so much fun the art style was gorgeous and Midna was a wonderful addition to the franchise. I also loved Phantom Hourglass though it certainly did depart from many series staples. I was actually a fan of the recurring dungeon because it was fun to find new ways to get through it each time. Using the map to keep hints for yourself was also a fun new innovation. ,nintendo,cgrnq3f,2,t5_2qhnk

1182081,0,t3_27nl96,It will be DS without a doubt if it is announced. Nintendo certainly wont release two zelda titles on the same console right next to each other. Internal competition is dangerous to sales. Pokemon is a unique case since they are essentially the same game and can generate extra money and promote interconnectivity through desire to get all of the pokemon. Zelda though? Nah not a chance. Only way I see it being that way is if they are released about a year apart from each other.Edit Its actually more likely that MM is winter  and Zelda U is .However I dont see Nintendo allocating the extra resources for a complete overhaul of a remake the DS route makes more sense financially and fans really wouldnt have much of a reason to complain the OoT remake was of excellent quality.,nintendo,ci2lqsx,39,t5_2qhnk

Theres a good chance Ill just go ahead and go for the XL though just because I dont think the added cost will be too much more and the added benefits of the bigger device are kind of appealing to me at this stage especially with Smash about to come out.In any case thanks for the solid advice!

1204133,0,t1_ci51iiy,Yes it plays very much like Devil May Cry. Platinum Games the company behind Bayonetta is largely made up of people who were previously employed by Capcom specifically Clover Studio. Im not sure if all of them directly worked on the Devil May Cry series but one can definitely see where their inspiration came from.As far as the gameplay goes it maintains a lot of the absurdities that made Devil May Cry so much fun to play hitting people  feet into the air with your weapon gravitydefying jumps pulling enormous weapons out of thin air and lightning fast movements are all present in this game. The graphics and camera also feel very DMCish specifically DMC and . The soundtrack is outstanding as well.

1212648,0,t1_ci60sjk,Its almost certainly not going to at this point sadly.  Ive been really excited for it but since people have gotten to put their hands on it and dissect the mechanics it is looking like a very poor game for those looking to actually get good at Smash.  Every design decision seems intended to cap skill ceilings moves have more endlag to prevent followups and base knockback again to prevent followup every movement technique from both Melee and Brawl has been removed and defensive aspects are buffed even more than Brawl still has Brawls overpowered shield  faster rolls.  The grand finals at Nintendos event went to time.I wrote an in depth discussion in this thread that went in to detail.Right now Melee is one of the most technical fast and most viewed fighting games in the world.  It is being held back because it cant be played on modern equipment Smash tournaments stock CRT TVs because upscaling causes lag on almost all HDTVs except very high end specialty ones.  We really wanted Smash  to be that or even close to it so it could replace Melee.Itll still be a fun party game in the end but Smash  is not going to stop Melee if it releases as it is in the current build.  Itll be played as a party game and forgotten.  In an ideal world Nintendo will make Smash  better before release but right now our best hope is a Melee HD release on the virtual console even if its just upscaled.,nintendo,ci61hs4,-4,t5_2qhnk

The Mario Kart offer will give you a lot of bang for your buck with the free game download and it will probably be a long time before we get a better deal than that.  Mario Kart has also been successful enough to prove that the Wii U still has a lot of market potential so I think Nintendo can credibly commit to supporting the console for the rest of the console cycle.

Battlefield  one of the biggest AAA titles was absolutely riddled with bugs for MONTHS. Aliens Colonel Marines was TERRIBLE. Sonic  was HORRIBLE. The War Z just bad. Do I need to continue? Some gamers lose trust in developers and that safety net of buying used is excellent for the consumer. Thats not to say I dont buy new games. I bought Dark Souls new TWICE because it was fucking excellent. Its a simple fact that if more time was spent making quality games there would be less used games. I remember when Red Dead Redemption came out it was super hard to find a copy for a while simply because no one wanted to trade it in.Its easy to say one company is hurting video games as a whole. But the truth its not that simple. If Gamestop is hurting them so is Ebay and Amazon.  Also to the OP. Are you fucking kidding me? They sold it to you for  bucks which is a great deal and because it was obviously used which means it was going to have some sort of wear and tear on it youre never shopping there again? Sure yeah the sticker is cover up the fact its a USED console. But it still works right? You can actually do what its made for still right? Or will the scuff marks make it unplayable? Because then maybe you should of bought a new console if thats important to you,nintendo,ci7un4a,5,t5_2qhnk

1236688,0,t3_288mi3,Its not as bad as people say. The issue is more how Nintendo chooses to implement the service in many of its online games. Accounts are tied to your Wii U system. You cannot replace your Wii U without contacting Nintendo Support and having them manually transfer your account to the new system.     There is no easy way to message a friend from inside a game. Its minor but its annoying.     A lack of group chat. Its rough if you are playing with more than  person.     Very few games implement ingame communication well or at all. Wii U supports Voice Chat. But for example you cannot communicate to a friend during a game of Mario Kart  at all voice or otherwise. It is limited to lobbies.,nintendo,ci8qsef,5,t5_2qhnk

1243587,0,t3_28c1l1,I....wow. Imagine. Just imagine and look at that reggie up there glaring at microsoft.Ive been thinking recently about how Nintendo should try to cut a deal with Capcom get themselves a megaman exclusive which would be HUGE especially now. Since capcom is having issues with amrveldisney they could get themselves a Nintendo vs. Capcom fighting game foot in the door to evo as an exclusive and along with smash Im sure SF would follow leading to Nintendo being the major eSports console since CoD is really the only other major console esport. Then we can finally get another viewtiful joe and Nintendo would own some very popular mature titles. I mean if Nintendo could get capcom atlus and sega on their side theyd be a serious threat again.,nintendo,ci9ipe5,1,t5_2qhnk

1298374,0,t1_cifo7ur,Im not saying they were all open but the difference is you arent forced along one path. In Mario Galaxy in most cases you fly from planet to planet on a set path the game designers want you to follow. As apposed to Mario  or Sunshine where you are given the name of the star and then you had to figure out what to do. There was a small amount of exploration and you could go out of order if you happened across another star on the way.

I have ADHD and struggled with school so much that I needed one on one tutoring in classrooms growing up usually thered be someone sitting next to me during class or Id meet with someone while people got their homework time in class.This is what ADHD and ADD is its a crutch that doesnt any benefits only negatives. Im not alone less than  of people with ADHD are able to graduate college. I spend over twice as long as a normal person does on my college work in a typcial day and am unable to hold a job while I attend because of my ADHD.However I am not dumb I have an honors GPA in my college however like I said ADHD is a crutch and just because you overcame it doesnt mean others can. Ive been diagnosed at  and its been about  years later and it hasnt gotten even the slightest bit easier. You can be gifted and have ADHD sure. Thats not what Im debating what Im saying is its harder for a person with ADHD to do anything so it damn well can be the cause of someones problems with mathId often have to have something explained to me  times because my brain wouldnt hold the information just like when Im trying to read and my adhd acts up the words just slide back out my brain and dont stick. ,nintendo,cj4ijph,1,t5_2qhnk

Aside from just solid gameplay and world design the way the Zelda iconography and atmosphere was handled really made it memorable. For example getting the Master Sword The music too  even in its old  bit glory ranks up there as some of the best game music of all time.Im not sure if the Dark Word music will ever be surpassed in my mind.

I did hate dark commandos for a while until I released they only take two charged dark beams and  super missiles and Prime  had some if not the best bosses in the series Dark samus Amorbis Chyyka Quadraxis and the Emperor ing are all breathtakingly amazing bosses however some of the other bosses could be irritating Looking at you Boostand Spider guardians... or just take to long like the grapple guardian.And even though you didnt mention it but allot of people see it as a reason to hate the game I though the dark world was an amazing idea it added a sense of conveyance to the world you wanted to hurry up and save aether because you have experienced the dread and hell of the dark world you hate going in there and the game knows it I also never seemed to have had to AFK for health even on hyper mode where every unit counts.,nintendo,cjfmsnl,5,t5_2qhnk

But the way they come up with used prices and the values you get for bringing those things in is the same as any other secondhand store.Lets turn this around for a second. Lets say that used games are different from used books and used movies and used cars and used CDs and used everything else. Lets say they are killing the industry. How do you jive that with the fact that the industry keeps growing? How is it that even as this cancer of gaming grows so too does the industry it sucks the life out of?

The sense of wonder the feeling of traversing the depths of a fantastical alien world...all made cohesive by Retros outstanding attention to aesthetics.The games strong points were enough for me to look over its shortcomings.

Id rather play an altered version of each like Super Mario  DS.What Ive read so far is that the second story mode on the DS version is similar to Master Quest on Gamecube and Id rather have the DS version because the new graphic look really good.

2031397,0,t1_ckxvvxb,So basically what youre saying sounds to me like If I cant be good at this game nobody can.The advanced techniques are not something the average player needs to worry about if they just want to mess around and have fun. They never stopped  and Melee from being massively popular hits with tons of casual customers. It doesnt affect them in the least. It only matters if you want to get into the upper echelons of competition. And if thats the case then youre going to have to accept that it takes a ton of hard work practice and dedication no matter what the game. Even Brawl. The advanced techniques arent the reason why MewKing will kick your ass in any of the  Smash games its because hes an expert whos practiced all these games to death. Hell demolish you in Brawl  or Smash  just as easily as he would at  or Melee. No amount of dumbing the game down will suddenly give you a shot at beating him. So what do you expect out of that anyway?Also I should mention that uNPPraxis was a very wellknown Brawl pro for many years. I think he knows what hes talking about here when even he says the game had deep flaws for competitive players.,nintendo,cky19ys,3,t5_2qhnk

However I played Etrian oddyssey on the ds and Shin Megami Tensei  on the ds... I realized that it wasnt bad at all. I went on to play Paladins Quest on the snes and it was great!

If you have not seen it yet I hope you will check out the information on the Internet. The short film is only about  minutes but this is our very first animated movie that uses Pikmin as its theme. Were planning to make this D movie available on Nintendo DS and make the HD version of the movie available on Wii U in the near future. At the same time we have also prepared a demo version of Pikmin  so anyone who hasnt played Pikmin can experience its unique joy. Continually launching campaigns after the release of software will lay the groundwork for the next iteration of Pikmin in the future. And needless to say we want it to be one of the motivations for potential consumers to purchase Wii U. We are making a variety of different efforts.,nintendo,cluycqx,3,t5_2qhnk

2342283,0,t1_cm17omg,Mario Kart CTF...I had never considered this yet I could see it being amazing.A soccer mode would be cool as well  green shell. Every player has an infinite mushroom to move around faster. Touching the shell when it is neutral grabs it. Your infinite mushroom is removed and the shell is automatically dragged behind you. To steal the green shell from an opponent player drive into it while it is being dragged. When you have the shell shooting it at a teammate passes it. The shell can be intercepted but if a player blocks a green shell in close proximity of the goal it hits them as normal and respawns in the center this keeps the middle chaotic. The area where it hits you normally will be marked by a colored half circle in front of the goal. The more karts there are in front of the goal in the colored half circle the bigger the goal gets. This is to prevent a whole team just sitting and blocking their goal making it impossible to score. One person in the colored half circle in front of the goal does not affect the size. Since heavy karts have an advantage being able to knock around smaller karts and general faster speed the shell is slightly bigger depending on weight.This makes it easier to miss a shot hits the side of the goal and makes it a bit easier to have it stolen from you. The size change would not be drastic. This emphasizes heavy karts as a more defensive role but doesnt make it impossible for them to take shots or carry the shell either. Each player can have one banana on the court somewhere. Driving into a teammates banana can also fuck you up and then they will get back one banana in their inventory. Driving over your own banana picks it up again. Driving into an enemies spins you out and if you were dragging the shell it is detached and sits neutral where you hit the banana.,nintendo,cm17vh0,5,t5_2qhnk

Not just because its a new gimmicky Nintendo system.When I got the wii when it first came out it hardly had any games for it. By the time they did come around they were subpar of what I was hoping except skyward sword but I had to buy a fancy controller for that. This lead me to believe that Nintendo doesnt care about the gamers anymore. Then I got smash for the ds and now I forgive Nintendo for the wrongs they had done.,nintendo,cmbu39d,1,t5_2qhnk

I mean yeah the graphics are nice on an artistic level but the cleanness of them makes the models lower polygon count more striking and apparent. Thankfully there doesnt seem to be a loss of detail fixation Kirby series doesnt really have that so its not as bad as games like Xenoblade.

2471288,0,t1_cmh4wi2,The various engine differences between Project M and Smash  make a huge deal. Any walkoff cant work in project m because of waveshinning since that can be performed from anywhere on the screen. Ledge stalling is a problem because of ledge invincibility and hogging. Sharking can be a problem because of the large amount of characters with glides.The yellow devil isnt a walkoff or a wall. Hes a stage hazard that creates an overcentralising strategy of camping behind him and waiting for to get the last hit. The yellow devil puts the camper in the advantageous position because of his morph shift thing when he turns into squares. It forces whoever isnt camping to which should be the looser since if your loosing you have no reason to camp but you probably understand this to continually dodge the squares and then gives the camper an opportunity to punish the dodges.  And Finally the yellow devil stays for an extremely long amount of time since its benefits no one by attacking it. How is  of the time half the time? And theres hardly any offstage game in this game at all because of the new ledge mechanics. And its not every  seconds thats just the length of the stopsand if it is sorry I didnt time the legnth of the main segments. And its not like every stop is a walkoff theres only a few. In Brawl Castle Siege was often a starter and always a counterpick and its a walkoff for  of the time. And that was when chain grabbing was still in the game so its even better now I know I said not to compare it to PM but you were simply saying its not good in PM why is it good now. I am saying that its good in brawl and better now. If something was worse or better from PM to Smash  with the engine changes you could point that out but almost everything favors more stages being legal.,nintendo,cmh5f5t,1,t5_2qhnk

It just sounds like you dont like going back that far and youd rather quit playing if youre punished too harshly for dying. And thats fine most people are like that but that doesnt mean a punishment for dying is bad its just harsher. There are things like hard modes and other options that change difficulty all the time in games still are they badly designed because they punish people harder?EDIT Also you bring this up gtgaming is kind of devoted to giving you a feeling of reward for completing levels in particular levels that you find trouble with. thats kind of the point and the goal of game design. the player must have a feeling of accomplishment after completing the game and trouble spots help immensely with this.Harsh punishments DEFINITELY help with this.

2524345,0,t1_cmo1zk9,Its an interesting issue. There have been two major changes to the industry since the previous gen started  . The first is wellintegrated motion controls the second is lower priced downloadable titles. Up through the PS era games were  and if they didnt cost that there was a reasonable expectation that youd be getting less. But since eShop and XBL Arcade and whathaveyou you have smaller teams putting out great games at lower costs. So its changed the whole game you can get awesome games at a low price. But mindsets take longer to change. So I can totally see what happened with something like Toad. It makes you weary. But its a fear thats rarely justified after the indie revolution.The same is true for a lot of the worry about motion control. People wail about motion control and swinging their arms about. But thats a misperception about that technology at this point. Its interesting to see how the industry has changed but also to see old suspicionsperceptions remain. And Im by no means a selfproclaimed forward thinker. I have moments where I get suspicious about these things too. Although with Toad I found myself thinking that it better be a budget title because I didnt think that its content could rival something like DWorld so it ought be cheaper. ,nintendo,cmo2huq,2,t5_2qhnk

I think theyre going to let EAD Tokyo go a bit wild with it. I do expect to see some kind of announcement for the next D Mario at E probably for November . Given that  is an anniversary year maybe there will be some kind of HD remake. I could see a Galaxy HD collection announced for next year. Im also not sure that Nintendo will do a new Pokemon. I suppose thats my desire but I feel like two versions every year for the last three years has been enough. Take a break before we go nuts on Pokemon again.

Learning the layout is challenging without a map or guidance but when you do figure out how to get through to a new area you cant help but feeling stoked.,nintendo,cmxlqhr,1,t5_2qhnk

2643077,0,t1_cn3e6d0,Dude youve got some crazy mental gymnastics going on. The XBone and PS are in fact gaming consoles. I know its fucking shocking. Give me proof otherwise and Ill recant my statement. Theyre both slaughtering Wii U sales. There is no competition there. Unless you look at France alone where the Wii U is beating out the other consoles apparently. For your viewing pleasureHere is a graph depicting the sales figures of the big  consoles going back to . Looking at the Wii U its easy to see it is lacking compared to the other . Graph Now we can isolate sales of just the three consoles and look at total sales  weeks after the launch of the PS here From this it is apparent that the Wii U has indeed outsold the Xbone. However notice the time since release difference. So in the spirit of fairness lets take a look at this graph with sales adjusted to  weeks after the console released.In no reality is the WII U beating the other two consoles. You just have a reserved bias that clouds your view of the truth. Please open your mind to the facts and dont bury your head in the ground when the facts point in the opposite direction of your beliefs. It makes for an overall better world. ,nintendo,cn3kzcz,1,t5_2qhnk

2703353,0,t1_cnavf1t,Either you havent played the Wii U version or you dont know what youre talking about.. There are  perfectly viable stages for competitive play. If you compare this to the  that are tournament legal this isnt even an argument.. Besides Brawl this is the first time that there is online play. I dont count Brawl because that experience was awful online. No one takes For Glory as a competitive game mode if youre concerned with that you go to tournaments. Here online means nothing. Its just a bonus for us. So yeah being able to have Battlefield stages would be great but this online doesnt make it any worse than older Smash games. . I agree that some UI decisions were weird including this one. Also theres the fact that you cant reset in event mode. I wouldnt say these break a game theyre just very minor annoyances. . The only Smash game to save your name is the DS one and thats because only one person plays on that console. This is nothing new so I wouldnt hold it against Smash . . I was never a fan of SSE so I cant say I care much about those types of modes not being included. Smash Run was okay on the DS and Smash Tour isnt really a single player thing. I think that the single player aspect comes from the amount of challenges in the game. There are  in the Wii U and its been a lot of fun for me to complete them by myself when I dont have someone to play with.. And what kind of mechanics? Wavedashing? The game is fine. Have you seen Diddy Kong Sheik Yoshi Captain Falcon or Sonic play? None of them are defensive. In fact theyre probably all top  most being top . The game just came out give it time to grow. ,nintendo,cnbd0ao,-1,t5_2qhnk

2796368,0,t3_2s3rkk,There are multiple factors on why SSB appeals to me. Here are a few big ones true for all of the games.Being able to match up character from different games and universes. When the first game and melee came out this was still very fresh! This isnt as appealing as it used to be but a battle between Mario vs Sonic Megaman vs Link ect never gets old.It follows the simple rule of easy to learn difficult to master. The controls are fairly basic. If I play a new character or one who I havent used in a while it only takes  seconds to learnremember the moves and play. Many other fighters like Mortal Kombat I only have a few fighters moves memorized and often you have to pause and check specialscombos. Better party game. Most fighters are v or if they are v each side only has one fighter at a time. SSB has always been up to  and now ! As a kid there were always  or  of us playing. Usually the winner kept his controller and the others handed off. With  people though you could quickly get back in the game and people werent always sitting out Yet it can be fun to watch too. Also with a few more games modes v FFA timestock. Setting up special matches or only allowing certain items. It is fun! Idk how else to say it. Smash just hits the right notes. I think most people agree SSB has that fun factor. This just work correctly. Rarely do you ever have a move that misses when it shouldnt and items like the baseball bat are very satisfying when you get that home run hit. ,nintendo,cnlxqfp,7,t5_2qhnk

A lot of people there are of the notion of PC Master Race and a Nintendo console for its exclusives and people have been going off at each other for including Nintendo in a sub that vehemently abhors consoles. So mods have made a sticky about how you can like your games on your consoles so long as you concede they would be better on PC if released on them. Honestly its not a big deal imo. Everyone should enjoy games in their own ways and Id just let it settle for a while. Mods are just people too and any fanboy of any gaming community will act like children from time to time.

I wanted the mm myself but their was no way I would have made it to GameStop in time to secure one while trading in my older products. Mm version sold out in  mins. Also to op the monster hunter one wouldnt have made it here in the states if it wasnt for gamestop.

2869499,0,t3_2sz7aa,Good article but its pointless. Nintendo does not listen to consumers for better or worse. If they followed consumers wed never get things like Wonderful  Bayonetta or all the other quirky games but the sad part is theyre not going to cave in and give us what we want like Microsoft did when they released a kinectless Xbone and lowered the price.Nintendo really needs to hire better people in their company outside of the game designers. They make great games and do everything else poorly. I own a DS XL and have preferred it but after seeing the Japanese ad for the new ds and the changeable plates and reading the new ds was slightly larger anyway I was sold on the new ds. How come Nintendo didnt test potential consumers and learn this themselves? Blows my mind.Im  and have gigantic hands so Im not buying this new ds xl for fat americans argument. I want the style of the custom plates and something more compact. The size of the XL gets old fast. It doesnt fit in pockets nicely. Well I will let my  speak.

Jesus man do you know how many racing games there was on last gen consoles?  A lot.  Just because something is the same genre doesnt mean they are the same subgenre.  Mario Kart is a gokart racing game FZero is a futurising racing game.  Need for Speed Forza Gran Turismo Project Cars DriveClub ExciteTruck they all have their own styles that differentiate themselves from the other games that form their own niches.  Although two many of the same genre is bad Nintendo generally doesnt have this problem with their IPs except for platforming which is still fine because they have been able to do so much in the genre with so many different ideas.,nintendo,cnvdyee,2,t5_2qhnk

2920209,0,t3_2tilub,Honestly my biggest problem with the Smash soundtrack was how much Sonic music was in it. Maybe its just my aversion to lyrics in general but almost all of the Sonic themes felt incredibly campy and even the rock tracks still had a pop sensibility. I hated them.I agree with you on everything else though. SMDWs music is criminally underused and you can see my nomination of Kirby Triple Deluxe for Best Soundtrack of  here. I wasnt a big fan of the Dillons Rolling Western gameplaynever been much for tower defense games reallybut it has some great music.I cant comment too much on the Pokemon music because Im just not versed in the series but much of it seems good. I tend not to like video game music that is very chirpy or lofi so I will always support the inclusion of newer tracks be they original or remastered over older retro themes. More from ORAS and XY would not have been a problem for me.In any case Im psyched to get my soundtrack in the mail soon.

2955419,0,t1_co3gyi7,Not to speak on OPs behalf or his wifes but at the end of the day he didnt give it up because his wife complained. He gave it up because he wanted to buy a Wii U. As a married man myself neither me nor my wife make a large financial decision I know  may not be large to a lot of people but it is for me and probably is for OP too without consulting the other. And we both consider what is best for the family before what the individual wants. With my marriage we put our family before our wants and needs. That means putting things like bills food savings insurance maintenance etc before hobbies like video games or whatever.If I wanted to buy something and my wife said I dont think we can afford that maybe if you sold your Wii we could afford it. That seems fine. Shes not telling me to go sell a beloved console because she wants to go buy something for herself. If OP really wanted to keep his console he could have found another way to make up the difference Im sure. In fact the way me and my wife see things and maybe the way OP and his wife see things is that there isnt my money and her money. Just our money because were a team were one unit. So we decide as one unit how to spend our money.In fact when I really wanted a Wii U back in the summer of  my wife fiance at the time suggested selling my  since I never played it anymore. It was a good idea and I dont regret it. I could have kept my  and cut back on eating out for lunch for a month or two and been able to afford it but I chose to trade in my  and buy a Wii U. ,nintendo,co41neg,1,t5_2qhnk

2989728,0,t3_2uezpj,You know why? Because in the gamecube era Nintendos target audience were the gamers. Nowadays Nintendos target audience is basically everyone. The gamers are just a small part of Nintendos current audience So they have to produce games that are accessible to everyone so that the casuals arent discouraged and continue to have fun with Nintendo games. FZero isnt your average fun and accessible game. Its unforgiving it breaks you in half with its crazy difficulty and its extremely frustrating Gamers love it. Its understandable that Nintendo doesnt want to make another one because for it to fit the publics demand theyd have to make it an easier more accessible game and then it wouldnt be Fzero anymore.What makes me sad is that the gamers are left aside were not treated with hardcore Nintendo games anymore. Because were not Nintendos primary audience anymore,nintendo,co7vsdh,-5,t5_2qhnk

3010730,0,t3_2unw88,Its becoming a rarity but if you could acquire a copy I would absolutely recommend Paper Mario The Thousand Year Door. It is my absolute uncontested favourite game of all time and screws with the Mario formula in such weird and wondrous ways you dont go from grass world to desert world and so forth in the traditional Mario sense you fight a Koopaeating dragon whos only weakness is a very specific sound join a wrestling federation and solve mysterious disappearances on a train. The RPG combat system is prodigious in terms customization of how you play down the road to really keep you engaged  especially with the use of intuitive tactile inputs that never overstay their welcome. The music and aesthetics leave me in awe to this day  Rogueports theme alone will remain embedded in your mind just because of how amazing it is. The game has aged incredibly well and I daresay I prefer how it looks to the Wii version and the story is nicely written each chapter being substantial enough to be considered a story all on their own. Its pretty expensive nowadays but if you ever get the chance then buy this game it is one of the best games not only for the Gamecube but period.,nintendo,coa26jq,40,t5_2qhnk

So they may have a limit on the number theyll make but at least for a little while and on certain theyre seeing how many people order them.And I think you can order multiples of the same item though I wouldnt risk it to find out unless you actually wanted multiples.,nintendo,coabj9l,0,t5_2qhnk

I was told earlier today by a Target employee that there are a lot of nintendo fans in the area and that there were lines for Amiibos at the store and that they have already gotten a lot of calls about the Majoras Mask DS.

3076303,0,t3_2ve68u,Wont happen. For one the fact that theyre selling through shipments of high demand items means theyre making a profit. Which is good. Secondly the fact that people wantmiss out on high demand items like the GC adapter and amiibo just means most people will be more keen on jumping the gun when Nintendo releases something else because itll likely have much more utility than it would have if there was an overabundance. For example a ton of people missed out on the LE Majoras Mask DS. Now tons of people are planning on lining up at retailers as early as  am just to get one. And if they miss out on that what do you think will happen when Nintendo releases a different LE NDS? People are going to pounce because they dont want to miss out on it again. This is how they get people to keep coming back for more. Lastly the Wii was a commercial hit and the DSDS has provided them with enough of a cash pool to keep them afloat for quite a while. The biggest hinderance to the Wii U was its marketing. Many people from hardcore to casual gamers owned a Wii and didnt see the practicality in purchasing what just seemed like an upgraded one. However even if the Wii U doesnt end up selling as well as they planned that wouldnt be the first time. Gamecube was actually considered a less than satisfactory console during its run and sold less than the N NES and SNES at just over  million consoles. They then bounced back with Wii which sold over  million consoles. Believe me the people at Nintendo are capable of bouncing back despite any hardship they fall on. ,nintendo,coguunf,2,t5_2qhnk

I usually do not like scary games like that but this one is super good.  I think the best part of the game though is the multiplayer.  One person takes control of the survivor while the other plays as Zombie King.  The survivor plays on the TV with a Pro Controller other controllers might work I am not sure and the Zombie King plays on the Gamepad.  They play a game of capture the flag.  ZK can control all different types of zombies while the survivor uses the weapons at his disposal and they each try to capture the flags and kill each other at the same time.  I would watch some videos on it or something.  I highly recommend the game.,nintendo,coydf0v,1,t5_2qhnk

3315007,0,t3_2y3zey,Etrian Odyssey IV might be a bit different from any dungeon crawlers youve seen before unless youve been around for the kinds of old old old school CRPGs its inspired by. You wander the labyrinth in first person and you can draw your own maps on the bottom screen like a piece of graph paper this might seem silly but later on the mazes and puzzles get so complex that you really do need to take detailed notes. Combat is your typical turnbased JRPG with random encounters but theres a lot of tactical depth involved and you wont get anywhere if you dont plan out your party and skill builds and plan each turn carefully Also special overleveled foes wander the dungeons and you have to observe their movements and be very careful not to get caught by them because they will kick your ass hard on your first visit to each floor. Theres a demo up on the eShop that lets you play the first couple of floors and then transfer your save to the full game so go ahead and check it out. Theres also Etrian Odyssey Untold a remake of the first game that adds an optional story mode with a prebuilt party cutscenes etc. It kinda feels like a bit of a step back compared to EO though not having subclasses removes a lot of flexibility and then if you want to use the story party you might find that theyre kinda underpowered and dont synergize well. Still fun but if you only play one I would go with EO.Theatrhythm Final Fantasy is a rhythm game spinoff featuring music from most every game in the series. So dont expect anything like the main series RPGs but if you like rhythm games its a good one. Certainly not something to compare to All the Bravest. Curtain Call is an updated rerelease with more songs and extras. Again theres a demo on the eShop you can try.I still havent gotten my hands on a copy of Virtues Last Reward but  is absolutely amazing.

3375743,0,t1_cpcq7hv,Im not really going to be critical of your post here youve said agreeable things. Im just going to add some thoughts on the rubberbanding in MK. Mario Kart has always been a balancing act between skill and luck. And Mario Kart  really upped the amount of skill required to win which I think has been a great improvement to the series. The rubberbanding happens but it happens way less than in most other MK games. When in first I feel what I call blueshell nervousness. Being incredibly weary of the blue shell comes from how regularly you could see one especially in the wii version. Its amazing how in  that feeling happens with regularity but how rare it it for the blue shell to appear. You can go three or four races without ever seeing one. Thats pretty wild. ,nintendo,cpd25qg,2,t5_2qhnk

3412100,0,t1_cpgtw21,Not trying to beat a dead horse honestly I appreciate how youve played both series and obviously know what youre talking about. Im just going to address several of your points that I cant quite agree withgt One of the biggest things I dislike about the first  Sonic games is how similar they are to each other. You mention them not taking out features as a good thing when I and many others see that as bad. It is easier to distinguish and remember games on their own when they have qualities that help them stand apart. Sonic  could be the same game in a lot of peoples minds while the Mario games are more distinct.Personally I dont view them as quite that similar. Ok well you could argue that Sonic  amp Knuckles is a very exaggerated and drawn out version of Sonic  but they all have their own style of level design. Sonic  doesnt have spindash obviously and its the one that feels the slowest out of the trilogy and its the one that fits most in line with the rewards skill with speed or some people would argue rewards memorization with speed. Sonic s gameplay was a lot more speedier and like you said definitely benefits from memorization as opposed to actual skill. Sonic  amp Knuckles just had hugeass levels which is what I liked about it so much actually. As for them not taking out features what features are you talking about? What features from Sonic  did you hate so much that you didnt like how they were in Sonic  amp Knuckles? I cant think of any. When I mentioned that I was referring to Super Mario World lacking some powerups from Super Mario Bros . While Sonic doesnt have powerups they took the shield from Sonic  amp  and expanded it into the FireWaterThunder shields in Sonic  and judging from your wording youre saying thats a bad thing. gt At the same time those graphics nowadays makes Sonic look dated while SMWs graphics have held up a lot better because they kept it simple.I cant agree with that either I think SMW world looks ugly knowing that its a SNES game and that the SNES is far more capable than that though it was an early SNES title and I do remember reading that the reason with SMW and Link to the Past only used  colors per sprite as opposed to  is to save space due to the higher manufacturing costs of cartridges with more space. With Sonic  I cant complain though Sonic s graphics were definitely a lot more simple than later MDGenesis titles such as Ristar or Sonic  amp Knuckles itself.Also about comparing Marios secrets to Sonics Chaos Emeralds I felt more of a sense of accomplishments collecting the Chaos Emeralds because youre actually rewarded something Super Sonic but not in Sonic  and in SampKs case you get to do the true final boss In addition to getting SuperHyper Sonic Super Tails and SuperHyper Knuckles. In Mario you get... nothing? Though I may be biased simply because Ive mastered Ss special stages as well as SampKsAnyhow I cant argue with any of your other points as they are all legitimate valid arguments thank you for explaining your reasoning as well. I do agree that Mario had more unique game play per installment particularly how SMB brought tons of new stuff to the table and SMW did the same while SampK was just an exaggerated version of Sonic .And yeah I compared SampK to SMW because SMW was technically the last Super Mario Bros. game it is SMB in Japan so in many ways it is the pinnacle of the Super Mario Bros. series. Similarly SampK lockedon as they intended not when played separate is the pinnacle of Sonic the Hedgehog IMO and while Super Mario World was released before Sonic  it felt unfair to compare the two because obviously Super Mario World is a better and more developed game than Sonic  which was the first game of its series. But when comparing the two pinnacles I prefer Sonic  amp Knuckles over Super Mario World.,nintendo,cph7dab,2,t5_2qhnk

They way things are going the Wii U will still be with us in early  putting it roughly  years behind the curve at that point.You can see this PS vs Vita comparison shows that for all its power the Vita is still a few steps behind s  powerhouse in terms of performance often games running at FPS to manage to maintain the visual fidelity.If Nintendo does move to a consolehandheld hybrid we can expect at best Wii U performance out of it likely less. That doesnt sound that bad until you remember than this is a piece of  hardware that Nintendo will have on the market until at least  and that FPS means youll be getting even less visual fidelity than expected almost all those Vita games were FPS.Do you really want to be playing on  tech in ?,nintendo,cpqxd3i,2,t5_2qhnk

3580344,0,t3_31cf0n,The two top guys in Platinum are the guys that originally helped develop Viewtiful Joe and were the biggest influence in creating them hence no sequels but the property ultimately seems to belong to Capcom but I feel like if Nintendo wanted to they could attempt to work with both groups and make it happen. Im assuming Nintendo has a good relationship with Capcom and having worked with the very two people that made Wonderful  and Bayonetta I feel like they can do this where Nintendo just needs Capcoms permission and Sakurai can work with the platinum guys to capture Joe perfectly. I like Bayonetta and Wonder Red but its just that I dont feel like they can be justified as must have Nintendo characters yet but by all means dont let that stop anyone if Solid Snake was able to make it in in the past. But Viewtiful Joe did help launch the Gamecube and I feel that doesnt get enough representation in Smash. I mean Wii Fit Trainer made it in.... come on? lol.

A AA she starts with a knee then a kick and finally a sort of spinning kick. Aup she does a sort of back flip kick. Aleftright she lunges forward gracefully with her foot out. Adown she stays in place spinning with her arms and one leg out. B she turns into the Goddess Blade GB Bup she turns into the GB instantly and the sword swings upward similar to Aether Recovery quickly and then turns to normal. Bleftright she turns into the GB and swings maybe once or twice while moving in the direction of input. Bdown she turns into the GB and slams down into the groundif she hits you youre buried. Final Smash she jumps into the air and summons three fireballa that zig zag and rampage through the stage before meeting her infusing the the GB and slamming downward. Bonus her roll animations will be the ball of blue light when she would come out and go back into the sword in Skyward Sword. Shell speak in that gibberish language.

3601463,1,t1_cq2o9ou,gtI own the video because its a new piece of intellectual property. Ill say this outright so that if you have any sense of integrity you wont need to waste time reading since Im absolutely correct in this regard. YOU. ARE. WRONG.There? Are we done? If not Ive got a lovely step by step explanation of why youre an idiot who doesnt understand legal theory pro tip if youre getting shit taken down by lawyers and then bitching when your bitching is responded to with further takedowns youre going to be laughed out of town when you stand up and claim to know more about the law than themImagine I like a TV show. I love this show. But I hate one episode. So I grab that DVD put it in my computer and then edit over the episode to put text on the screen showing all the times the show does something I hate. Then I want to broadcast that to people for free.In an act that would be surprising to fucking noone I would be sued for copyright infringement. Because that video that I made? It contains content that isnt mine. The words are mine. I may have put a lot of thought and effort into that video. It may be creative and insightful and I may want a lot of people to see it. But just because I made the video that contains my opinions does not give me ownership of the source material. Understand? You own the words that went over it. Packing it together in a video doesnt magically extend your rights to cover the source as well.The courts make exceptions to this when the use of the material is clearly intended for something that is in the public interest like education or when its a notforprofit use that doesnt need full unadulterated access to the entire source material.Youve uploaded in near entirety  minutes of Mario Kart  footage. Nintendo owns that footage. You own the words on the top. The fact that they exist in tandem in your YouTube page doesnt mean you own MarioKart. It doesnt mean YouTube owes you to keep that video up. It doesnt mean if Nintendo makes you take down the video theyre violating your rights. If Nintendo wanted to put your video up and make money off it without your permission then YOU could sue THEM. If you want to put Nintendos video up without their permission then they can sue you. The law works both ways.You dont have magical judicial extension over other peoples intellectual property. Mario Kart is not your intellectual property.YouTube is not censoring you you are free to upload a voice track of all your criticisms. You are free to upload a video of you talking about how much you hate MarioKart. Youre just not allowed to take long form footage of someone elses intellectual property.Nintendo isnt breaking the law you stupid jackass. You seriously think a team of lawyers for a multimillion dollar organisation are this dumb? That they would literally  break the law just to what pick on a random stranger on the internet? Seriously these people spend their entire careers researching the law they know the consequences of breaking the law and then they see your video and THEN they decide Fuck it Ill just throw my career away and ignore everything I learned because this guy doesnt like what my company made?What the shit is wrong with you? Are people really this dumb?,nintendo,cq2sj9g,-1,t5_2qhnk

3660633,0,t3_32asw5,gt Code Name S.T.E.A.M. was perhaps too Japanese in its caricaturization of USA persons or too American Im a Canadian so I didnt really get the appeal. Plus the graphics at least based on the trailers moved away from the colorfulness many of us Nintendo fans are used to. But most importantly despite its innovations in the turnbased strategy its still a turnbased strategysomething Nintendo already has plenty of Paper Mario MarioampLuigi Pokemon Fire Emblem.I love the graphics. I can almost see the BenDay dots and feel the turn of that cheap comic book newsprint page. I think the fact it isnt doing well is  about the genre. The gameplay is too different from Fire Emblem and Advance Wars to draw in those fans excluding those for whom the development studio is justification enough and turnbased strategy is already a pretty niche genre. Not everyone knows what to make of that XCOMEUstyle gameplay. It does well on PC but strategy games LIVE on PC.That its a new IP doesnt help. People who complain about repetitive IPs generally arent fans of Nintendo anyway so theyre not gonna buy the game. People who are already Nintendo fans clearly havent been turned off by the persistence of Nintendos bigname IPs so a new IP isnt going to ingratiate them all that much.

The motion controls for the Wii version can get a bit iffy a times since you have to waggle to attack. Otherwise Okami is one of my favorite games of all time. The whole story has so much depth and integrates Japanese culture so well. Ive never seen a game integrate culture into its gameplay of all things! The brush techniques are a fresh take on the action gameplay of regular platinum games. The environments are on the same scale as the Zelda series and are a joy to run through. Most of all the music is heavenly no pun intended. Every track fits so well with the environment and is memorable in its own way. One of my favorite tracks the final boss theme The Sun Rises has such a motivational feeling behind it for you to defeat the final boss as a badass wolf sun god. Overall whether it be by Wii or PS I recommend you get Okami.

Assuming theyd be reticent to create characterspecific karts this late in the game I think they could do it relatively inoffensively as a standard kart if like the Blue Falcon the wheels go underneath so they arent visible when racing and Kirby sits on top when riding it whereas other characters sit inside. Not sure what to do with the glider  maybe wed just have to bite the bullet with that one. Either way Im sure Nintendo could work something out.,nintendo,cqg1dr8,1,t5_2qhnk

Then why did they make doubles for Mario Party? I thought amiibo were just a sort of memory storage you could save data on and that they contained a key that would be used sort of like DRM to unlock things in other games.

4101431,0,t1_crnru3q,gtBy spending so much time defining IP this thread has effectively wasted time that could be used discussing the topic trying to define IP so that it fits more conveniently into their argument.gtInstead everyone says well technically this game isnt a new IP so chalk up a point for my side. Its not meaningful discussion and only reveals the immaturity of the argument.I dont disagree with your points here and I think that theres an unfortunate contingent that does this here and anytime analysis has to be done. But I think that in some of the comments there is legitimate discussion about what the term means. I think part of what might be upsetting about analysis generally is that while there has to be a stopping point to the discussion it is something that can be nitpicked into irrelevance. I think youre pointing to two issues with analysis or definition squabbles. The first is that people routinely fail to take out personal opinion and the second is that people routinely fail to end such discussions before things turn into trivial nitpickings. These surely are problems but I dont think that takes away from doing this sort of activity.  ,nintendo,crnse4k,2,t5_2qhnk

4162749,0,t3_38cvo8,I just finished Super Metroid for the first time with  and a half hours and  of the items found. I wouldnt say its one of my absolute favorite games but I did enjoy my time with it. I found it interesting how the last hour or so had a subtle emphasis on power. The game made you feel OP when you got the Screw Attack took it away when the baby came in. It gave the feeling back to you as Mother Brain was defeated at first took it away as the baby was killed and gave it back to you when you got the Hyper Beam.spoiler That probably actually means nothing its just something I noticed.Trajectile One of two games I decided to download when I realized I still had points in my DSiWare account and my favorite of the two. I love how there is actually a deep layer of strategy to the game and its possible to complete each stage multiple ways.Spotto The other game I got on DSiWare. I got and beat it within the week. I found the game very short just  stages. Though it did get more challenging towards the end I still managed to beat most stages in  tries. It was interesting playing this and Trajectile at the same time as they have similar ideas they have very different executions with Spotto focusing on timing your throws with the objects movements and Trajectile focusing on when to use certain ships. The graphics are adorable as well.Kid Icarus Uprising Still working through getting  on each chapter. It is proving quite difficult but I am slowly getting through it.Tales of Symphonia Just fought the fake summon spirit of windspoiler on my second playthrough.

4284141,0,t1_cs88lri,Honestly I think amiibo have the potential to completely redefine future Nintendo hardware  but only if theyre clever about utilizing them.Right now amiibo are a novelty at best. Theyre selling out but as you pointed out its largely because theyre not exactly delivering mass quantities to retailers. If Nintendo invested in their own manufacturingbranch they could suddenly dominate the market because not only could they compete with Skylanders and Disney Infinity they would still have their pool of firstparty games and Nintendo rarely delivers a dud.As far as making a Super Mario D Worldstyle game? That would actually be pretty simple. You could probably even just copypaste their Smash Bros models maybe a few little touchups for stylistic choices and the core gameplay probably wouldnt vary all that much you would run around jump and each character would have a basic attack and then a single Special Ability button.Obviously its not something they could just launch tomorrow but the beauty of D Worlds simplistic gameplay is how easy it would be to add new characters. And the difference too is that you dont need to worry about powerups for them.,nintendo,cs8jjiv,1,t5_2qhnk

4284264,0,t1_cs8jfbj,If youre going to announce a big game you do it at E. If youre in the hole and need to drum up support you show alpha footage to keep people calm see Star Fox last year.Next year they will unveil the NX. It will most likely release in . That means Zelda to be unveiled at next E as a showstopper will have an outing of roughly  months. No one is going to buy a Wii U if they know the successor is around the corner so Zelda U is looking at maybe  million sales. At least Skyward Sword which was in a similar boat had a console install base of over a hundred million to accommodate major sales. Wii U cant even host a high number of sales.This years E is the end of the Wii U. Not a single new unannounced title. We already knew about Star Fox and Yoshi. Next year itll be Zelda and an announcement that itll have an NX version.I am starting to think that the NX isnt even a console. I think Nintendo are getting out of home consoles. It would honestly be the smart thing to do. Akin to Steam on the PC. Nintendo like to innovate and create new ways to play but Microsofts Hololens demo showed that Nintendo arent up to it anymore. People rejected the Wii. Theyve rejected the Wii U. They dont care for the stereoscopic D of the DS they care about a more powerful DS.I dont think Nintendo are done or dead. I think businesses change. Reggie made it crystal clear this year that Nintendo is transforming as a business. Who knows what NX is but I dont think its another home console.

Thats it. The rest of that show was the same tired sports games they release every year. And Ubisoft barely gets a pass because Assassins Creed in and of itself is already a very tired franchise in my eyes.Yes Nintendos conference wasnt all that much to write home about. I was expecting more clear release dates with a lot of the titles they showed. Not so much the new stuff like Starfox but more the stuff we already know is coming soon like Fire Emblem. There were like  titles overall in the entire presentation with a very clear date of release Xenoblade Chronicles and Super Mario Maker. It wouldve been enough for me to know stuff like Holiday  or st Quarter  like with Mario Tennis or HW Legends. Thats all I want rough release dates. But when I read stuff like  it might as well be the st December  when a game with that designation is released and that was a universal problem across all presentations not just with Nintendo.On a side note I still have no reason to buy either a PS or an Xbone and Im more than salty that there is still NO western release date or period for Bravely Second neither from Nintendos nor even Squares side of things.

Theyve consolidated their hardware development teams and brought versions of some games Smash Hyrule Warriors Mario vs. DK to both current platforms. The forthcoming account system promises to further connect their hardware. . It seems to me that when factoring in smaller eShop releases Nintendo has provided a remarkable stream of first party games especially considering how much harder games are to develop nowadays. It just feels insufficient as there are not enough rd party games to cover the gaps. . Theyre actively making collaborations with rd parties. Hyrule Warriors Pokken and a number of smaller things like the Skylanders cross over show that Nintendo is more willing to collaborate with other developers than ever before. . With Bayonetta  and Devils Third Nintendo has bought into individual games and in the grand scheme of things Monolith Soft is a pretty new acquisition. ,nintendo,cs9v6a7,1,t5_2qhnk

4299083,0,t1_csa7m0x,From what it looks like people either like the game or think its a bit boring but nearly everyone doesnt like the name Metroid being attached specifically after not having a satisfying game since Corruption. Perhaps if it was announced after either a D or D main series game or alongside it it would have gotten more approval. For example Hunters was announced inbetween the releases of Zero Mission and Echoes. Federation Force was announced after a five year drought over  years since a classic style Metroid and  since the last Prime in the stead of an expected announcement from Retro.

4310827,0,t3_3a8wug,Did Nintendo really abandon the Gamecube early? Didnt the Xbox and Playstation  have almost the same length lifespans...? Or am I missing something else?Perhaps Im missing something.... You said that third parties abandoned Nintendo because of the Wii. Yet as someone who hopped in during the Gamecube era.... It seemed like they had already all left by the time I showed up. Theres the infamous Square leaving during the N era and the Gamecube famously didnt get GTA. Honestly in my opinion third parties dont make games for Nintendo systems not because of specs but because of Nintendos image. Everyone I knew during the Gamecube era including me! thought the Gamecube was weaker than the PS when the truth was the other way around. And they acted accordingly. If the consumer thinks that Nintendo has the weakest system and doesnt want to buy graphicspushing games on there rd parties wont make them.... Even if that isnt the truth! Now said image problem has definitely been contributed to by many of the decisions you point out and doing the things you suggest would definitely help. I just dont think its as simple as specs and no gimmicks.I definitely agree with you that the Wii Us launch was mediocre to awful. I can see why you think dropping the Gamepad would help a lower price would definitely increase adoption I agree but I kind of doubt double but I think we would then just lose all innovative new uses. I mean how many games were compatible with the circle pad pro? I dont think its much more than .Also Nintendo kind of had to announce the NX. Too many people thought Nintendo was abandoning traditional gaming with the announcement of the DeNA partnership even with the NX announcement. Without that the pitchforks really would have come out. And whos to say NX is a Wii U successor? Nothing theyve said has pointed to it. Im confused as to why people are assuming that.Anyway though I disagree with many of your points its clear a lot of thought went into this post and its given me some food for thought.

4321694,0,t3_3ah0w0,As a big Fire Emblem fan FE Awakening ranks nd on my list.  I have played almost all Fire Emblem games Fire Emblem  to  on SNES  All Fire Emblem games from GBA  Radiant Dawn.  Fire Emblem  Geneology of the Holy War is still the best among them.  Fire Emblem Awakening takes some elements from FE the Inheritance System which makes the game have tons of replayability.  The problem with current FE games is their almost non repairable weapons that people tend to save on using them.  Another problem is the part that you can grind to ease the difficulty of the game.  FE Awakening however makes a way for hardcore fans to get the challenge they are looking for by playing Lunatic and Lunatic  which is crazy hard even for series veterans.  If you do decide to pick up Awakening this is what my bro experienced as a first time FE player.. Played Normal on his first run.  Finished it easily but with bad pairings.. Played Hard on his nd made some plans on who to pair had tons of game overs on the first few chapters started planning ahead on how to finish the maps.. Played Lunatic on his rd run.  Seeing how difficult it was as he never got passed the first few maps decided to buy some DLC for easier leveling and money.  Still had a hard time finishing the game as you will really die a lot almost finish the map then someone dies and had to restart the whole map.. Played Lunatic again on his th run.  Tested if he could finish most maps without DLC help and without game overs he failed raged and stopped playing for a while.. th try on Lunatic and he finally got it. Finally agreed the game was worth it as it caters for new players for the series the veterans previous FE fans that skipped the new gen FE games due to their lack of good mechanics that FE had.I played the game twice only though once on Hard then Lunatic.  I consider FE Awakening as the nd best as people can still find a way to bypass the difficulty with DLC and grind.  Weapons you tend to use sparingly as some of them are rare and hard to repair.  FE is still by far the best one IMO as the arenas are limited per chapter most enemies are limited and are required to plan on who you will be giving levels to as you cant max all of them.  Big plus points for FE Awakening is the Dual Audio option.  Voice overs and it looks nice in D.   ,nintendo,cscs8b3,2,t5_2qhnk

4340627,0,t3_3aq575,While most generations of consoles lasted  years were not entirely certain if this generation will either return to form after the  year long Gen  or it will continue a trend of generations getting longer and longer. What sort of state would the PS and XBOX One be in by Christmas ? Would they be reaching the limits of their hardware running out of steam or would they still have sufficient space within their limits that developers are comfortable working in? Remember that some games announced at this E for those consoles could expect release dates around Christmas  and nothing about them suggests that they are Gen s swan song if anything they suggest that Gen  has simply found its feet and is ready to keep going for several years to come.In that environment any first party announcing and releasing a console in late is a bit like imaging if they had released a new console in . There would be no desire for either customers to buy or developers to support such a console there were alternatives that had been out for several years were getting active support already and had not yet reached the end of their processing tether. Unless it was significantly more powerful than competitors was as easy to develop for and was competitively priced then it wouldve been dead on arrival.It is for those reasons that I believe the NX to be a separate concept from a traditional home console with a true successor to the Wii U coming some years later. For all the bad decisions they have made over the years Nintendo is not going to release a new console when there is no desire for one from either developers or customers.,nintendo,csex3bd,3,t5_2qhnk

4409998,0,t3_3bjpyi,I just need to put my two cents in here. First of all the NX will be discussed next year sure but I doubt itll be shown off. While the Wii U came out a year before the PS and Xbox One its still too early in the cycle for a successor to be announced. Theres tons of great games out for the Wii U and many great games still on the horizon. Id say maybe wait for a price drop this holiday which seems pretty likely given that the system will be  years old this year but by no means does this indicate that the Wii U is on its way out. Nintendo always tends to be secretive about their games until the year before or year of release and just remember we still havent had Wii U versions of Animal Crossing a proper D Mario in the vein of Galaxy or Sunshine or Metroid yeah Im still hopeful itll happen. So I think its way too early to think Nintendo is just gonna drop support on the Wii U.,nintendo,csmqpg5,6,t5_2qhnk

4579819,0,t3_3dqz8a,This article is right in its stance that Nintendos fans comes from the games. However there are a few ignorant statements in this article.. Using a game that does not explain itself well and then saying its the consoles fault is unfair.. Its not the consumers fault the Wii U failed? Of course it is! Its just as much their fault as it is Nintendos. It doesnt mean they want Nintendo to die but if gamers dont purchase the new console because its weird then doesnt the system fail financially?. Youre using smash and mario kart to state how the Wii U gamepad isnt used properly? Of course its not! Can you imagine drawing on a screen to fight in smash or drive in mario kart? That would be ridiculous. Just because a console had a gimmick doesnt mean it should be used for every game. Just look at pokemon games they hardly use the touch screen at all on the DS and DS.Now my opinions in generalIm pretty sure that gimmicks help Nintendo. The Wii was a major success and many of the quirky games Nintendo has keep it going strong. Straying from this might not be the best decision especially now since most associate Nintendo with not being graphical powerhouses. If Nintendo made a console with amazing graphics I dont know if people would like it because its weird for Nintendo not to be weird. I just feel Nintendo should keep being different because thats why fans love it so much.tldrBlaming a console for a games mistake is dumb consumers still cause console failure smash and mario kart are bad examples of gamepad functionality and I think Nintendo is still great.,nintendo,ct7w2nv,4,t5_2qhnk

It would have all Zelda Mario Donkey Kong Kirby Animal Crossing Fire Emblem Pokemon FZero Metroid Nintendo Characters Mii Wii Fit Trainer Wii Fit Board etc. PacMan MegaMan Sonic etc. You get the point.

They wear suits that is an amalgamation of their parents. Its a FPS MMO like Destiny and you can customize your suits accordingly. You can fly Samus her spaceship and explore planets. With the smartphone integration you can command your ship to fly around on autopilot. When it discovers a new planet your app would warn you and you can share this newfound planet on Twitter and Facebook. It also supports Oculus and Morpheus itll be on all platforms of course. If I use the Wii mote with Kinect and Oculus Im able to similate all movements and when I press my temples itll scan the environment. I can call Cortana shell give me tips like the scanner in MP would. Theres also a marriage system so I can wed other players same sex is possible. Sex change is allowed and you can choose to be a pre OP trans. Your children will inherit your traits and will boost your stats when walking in the same perimeter.

4679606,0,t3_3f1f7f,Ive gotta go SNES. Dont get me wrong I love bitchiptune but I dont personally feel its as musical as what the SNES could do. And while the N had some great tunes the MIDI could be a little grating depending on the game. I think many sound and music developers did a great job of using the limits of the technology to their advantage.As for an example of why the SNES is my favorite I present the entire OST to Chrono Trigger Even in this day of amazing orchestral tunes CTs soundtrack is still my favorite video game soundtrack of all time.I almost think its like how the Miis can have so much character even though theyre cartoony and minimalist while the avatars on PlayStation Home are all kind of generic despite being very realistic. I love orchestrated music but there was some insane creativity on the SNES and the music is some of my favorite!EDIT Strains of Insanity at an hour and  minutes is one of the most amazing examples of what could be pulled off. Its so incredibly simple but one of the eeriest tracks Ive ever heard in a game. And I think the SNESs limited but strongerthanNES sound helped make it so. The constant droning notes high and low. The middle notes fading in and out. And most importantly the lowerquality laughingcrying voices in the background. I just dont think it would have the same impact in another style. Its perfect. Coupled with the events going on while this music is playing its one of my favorite moments in any video game.,nintendo,ctkeu8e,5,t5_2qhnk

4686548,0,t3_3f42tr,I really cant take stuff like this seriously. Everybody thinks they know better then Nintendo as if they know precisely what Nintendo needs to do to make it big. Its never that easy. If Nintendo gives up on hardware and makes games for other consoles thats it for them. Theyll never be able to get away with making new hardware and sadly well never see the kind of uniqueness they bring to the table.Sure Playstation and Xbox hardware is better but that alone does not make for better games. It seriously doesnt. Id rather have the kinds of risks and failures that Nintendo hardware brings instead of safe and generic hardware.,nintendo,ctla8kx,3,t5_2qhnk

Does the endless ocean of rd party game drop the sales of massive tiles for any damn console? Does having only  compare to  rd party game release near the release time of CoD or halo or mario or zelda game going to effect its sales? Hell no because they are big hyped up titles that people are going to get.

4707916,0,t3_3f24ie,Copying my answers here for discussionGames Point  Super Mario   Any version N DS Wii Wii USuper Mario  has always been a game that I can jump into either for some serious challenges or for some fun exploring.  The tight design of small worlds combined with many things to do in any direction gave such a great sense of environment and rightly rewarded thorough exploration. The mechanics and gameplay always felt spot on intuitively blending platforming combat and collectathon moments. I am currently working on ing the DS version and have high hopes for its successors that I have not played Sunshine and Galaxy  and perhaps even some mods. Point  Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time  Any version N GCN Wii DS Wii UOcarina of Time has been a game I have played all my life. I remember waking up to watch my older brother play it. I remember learning how to read while playing it myself in elementary school. I remember borrowing a friends N to play it again in middle school. I bought a DS to play it again in high school but later gave the game to my older brother for his DS. This game embodies an emotional experience that I can always fall back to and its puzzles combat and story are always engaging. Ive tried my hand at performing a few speedrunglitching tricks on a Japanese Rom but I am currently working on ing the GCN Masterquest version. Point  Banjo Kazooie  NRare captured my heart with Banjo and Kazooies silly yet challenging quest. Between the jokes music characters and the platforming Ive always had a great time while playing this game. Ive  completed it with that one dang jiggy left underneath the propellers in Rusty Bucket Bay. I also love how BanjoTooie picks up exactly where the first game left off although I have not gotten very far into the second game. Points  Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask  Any version N GCN Wii DSMajoras Mask is probably my favorite game of all time and I try to play it again just as often as Ocarina of Time. What really connects me to Termina are the stories the sidecharacters tell and the change Link brings to their lives. I do look forward to playing it again on the DS.  Point  Mario and Luigi SuperStar Saga  GBAI can play this game for hours to days on end. Although I have yet to enjoy another Mario RPG I quite enjoyed the BeanBean Kingdom its inhabitants exploration sidequests and the precise timingbased combat of the Bros adventure down south. This game makes me wonder why Luigi doesnt have a lightning power in Smash Bros.  Point  Mario Kart Wii  WiiFor an exciting immersive and active game Ive never had a better experience. Some people complained about the rubberbanding but I find using the Strategic Items option to be much fairer. I never got to play online back in the day but with Wiims Retro Mod and Wiimfi servers at least I can play a variety of courses with my friends. Mario Kart  is pretty good but I do like the variety of cart and character stats in Wii better plus Wii has a decent selection of Battle tracks. As always when possible Im using Tilt Controls! Point  Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze  Wii UAt first I was skeptical to buy this game for Wii U but I have not regretted it. I listened to the soundtrack before I played it and that alone was both parts soothing and amazing. The challenges the quick pace and the capability to play with a partner kept me going in this game until I got to the secret temple levels. It was everything I loved about Donkey Kong Country Returns and more although Im going to go play the Original Trilogy before I come back to either of those games bonus levels. Points  Pokemon Omega Ruby  DSAlthough I do love each generation of Pokemon mainseries games my favorite has to be the current remakes of my precious Hoenn sweet Hoenn. I had already Caught them all after X and Y but the additional story elements and metagame updates in ORAS were even more attractive to me. Im excited for whatever game Game Freak makes next.Consoles Points  Nintendo Wii U  I picked up a used Basic model in Fall  and Im happy that it can do everything the Wii can plus much more. I currently have Smash  Mario Kart  Super Mario D World Hyrule Warriors Pikmin  Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze Wind Waker HD and I plan on picking up Splatoon Captain Toad Runbow Super Mario Maker StarFox Zero Zelda Wii U and maybe a few others. Its not dead to me.  Point  Nintendo Wii  I never owned a GameCube so buying my sister a Wii over Holiday  was a jump for both of us into both consoles libraries plus virtual console gave me access to some of my old favorites from N and SNES. Point  Nintendo   My first console although I no longer have one still has some of my favorite games. OoT MM SM MK SF BK amp BT Army Men Sarges Heroes DKR Pokemon Stadiums and Snap Mario Parties etc. Points  Nintendo DS  Club Nintendo Card Case  full of games and excited to have more on the way  Mario and Luigi Paper Jam LoZ TriForce Heroes Fire Emblem Fates and the next Pokemon. Points  Nintendo DS Lite  Picked one up early in high school to jump into Gen of Pokemon and I have tried to keep one ever since to go back and play old GBA games. The battery life is amazing too. Point  GameBoy Advance  Even though I never owned one I still have to give it a point for its library.Characters Points  Link  Legend of Zelda.  HutHi Hiyaah! Point  Darunia  Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Hyrule Warriors. What a hot beat! Point  Linebeck  Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass. Dat moment when Linebeck finally becomes a badass. He also has an interesting romantic history. Points  Donkey Kong  Donkey Kong Country. Hes also pretty goofy in the Donkey Kong Country cartoon. Point  Luigi  Mario and Luigi. Lightning Luigi. Habidibodibudiby. Point  Toad  New Super Mario Bros Wii Super Mario D World Point  Dry Bones  Mario Kart Wii,nintendo,ctnyyi7,2,t5_2qhnk

4717642,0,t1_ctovwzj,I agree entirely with this.  I mean some of the music in the original and Dark Moon is kind of creepy and mysterious even for a more parodic horror gameThe Possessors in Dark Moon are in theory a pretty creepy foe too.  Okay their design isnt creepy but the way they take over anything and violently alter its behaviour is almost like something youd imagine in a Doctor Who episode.  The idea of a monster that could be lurking in anything human animal animate inanimate or otherwise could be quite an effective idea for a more horror based game in the series.  Especially with a few equally terrifying portrait ghosts.Mix that with the beta elements in the original game like the supposed  hour time limit and youd have quite a terrifying game in theory.,nintendo,ctp73yc,2,t5_2qhnk

Hes one of the old guard he was at Nintendo long before Iwata was and hes very much contributed to a lot of Nintendo successes.However for the average Joe Gamepak he is an unknown. One of the big reasons Iwata was so beloved was because of how accessible he made himself. Directs and Iwata Asks were huge in getting a feel for Iwata and when you got to know more about him you were left with good feelings. Im not sure if Takeda has the same Charisma that will remain to be seen. What is for sure is that he has the same work ethic and chops as Iwata did for sure. ,nintendo,cu40u5t,4,t5_2qhnk

Kirby Dream Land Superstar Air Ride Kid Icarus Uprising Meteos a game more people NEED to play. It goes farther than Smash. Id say he has the best track record compared to anyone else in the industry.Secondly Pranger made a slew of controversial comments. It wasnt only that about Sakurai.Thirdly where do you get the idea he overworks employees? Or that he thinks highly of himself? Sakurai does what he thinks makes for good gameplay. Miniscule and stupid crap like King K. Rool costume barely even make a mark upon the games result.Also Saki Amiyama and Takamaru arent in any way classic characters.

4948873,0,t1_cuic5g5,Nope I dont think youre shutting me down.  Im enjoying this convo.As far as the whole you cant have Zelda without Ganondorf well there has been.  In fact the game released just before Twilight Princess didnt even mention Ganon by name.  Handheld titles have also consistently featured nonGanondorf villains mostly Vaati the Oracle games halfway count since the main games didnt feature Ganon but the true ending did.Aa far as the Demise argument goes he never specifies that he will appear as Ganondorf particularly.  Just that he will appear in some form.  It could be Ganondorf or really anybody else like Vaati for example or yes even possibly Zant.  Considering that Ganondorf should have been effectively neutralized post OoT it would make sense for Demise to manifest in another form.  But this takes into account lore additions made after the release of TP so its a moot discussion.And as far as Zant not being incredibly remarkable this characterization of him only cropped up around the time they were setting up the Ganondorf reveal.  In fact you can almost split Zant into two characters The prereveal Zant treated as a legitimate threat and the postreveal Zant who is treated as a puppet by a higher power.  There are better ways that he could have been handled.,nintendo,cuicgdg,1,t5_2qhnk

5023696,0,t1_curiva1,. Again death of the author.  If people couldnt enjoy a product the way they wanted we wouldnt have things like the Zelda timeline.  Besides this Nintendo included games that focus on the Super Mario Bros. style of gameplay so of course they added NSMB in.  They included the D games even though they dont necessarily play like the D titles because theyre such important milestones. Also why wouldnt you link to the english in the first place?.  Super Mario RPGs got platforming in it and Super Marios in the title so it must be a main series title..  But Metroid Other M was created to flesh out the story of the series and to incorporate D series elements into the D realm just like Mario D LandWorld though it wasnt as successful as those games.  Just because its so different in some respects doesnt disqualify it.  It was trying something actually new like other games such as Zelda II or Super Mario Sunshine did in the past.  Super Mario World to  is a huge leap but theyre still considered main series titles.  What qualifies NSMB as spinoff material is the lack of innovative philosophy that the originals had and the apparent desire to play off peoples nostalgia rather than actually continue the series in any meaningful way just as spinoffs tend to do.  Look at Mario Kart.  The gameplay is practically unchanged from the original with gimmicks here and there that dress up the action but really dont have any major effects on what is happening with few exceptions of course.  . gtI mean you can think any way you want but to the company themselvesI dont want to sound like a broken record but Death of the Author.  In the world that we live in the creator does not necessarily have the final word on a product.  Its more like a perpetual open conversation just like ours right now.gtto the majority of fansReally?

Itll be hugely expensive to develop and probably not even remotely fun because all that time and effort was spent into making the game realistic. Look at all the unreal engine tech demos. The game engine is perfectly capable of rendering something completely photorealistic the physics engine is also pretty damn close to being capable of that and hardware available is easily capable of running it.

It seems like Nintendo want to stop people doing LPs so rather than being honest theyve just priced them out of the market.More than that Nintendos rules allow them to remove huge amounts of content for none content related issues. If Nintendo decides they dont like cursing in a Mario Kart video  years from now? Goodbye videos. They have seized more than revenue this is massive power grab.gt I feel like certain youtube personalities that are upset because they wont make as much moneyA lot of the youtube viewers are completely in the dark when it comes to realising how much money effects the videos they see.Cartoons were rampant in youtubes early days. They died fast when revenue model changed. All the cartoon makers could make better money in other ways and that pull was so strong that it killed the internal market. Every time there is a change the youtube channels will adapt because they want to make the best content and to make the best content you need to be able to do it as a job.  When revenue was based on views users would pump out lots of short videos. Now most of the videos are longer as thats the only sustainable way of making each video. Each time there is a change to revenues you will see a change in the way content is presented.I know reddit is really into demonizing youtubers at the minute but I think its a little unfair. The youtubers arent furious over the lack of money. They are annoyed because they like Nintendo games and want to make passionate Nintendo LPs but know that their hands are being forced. The huge cut in revenue is bad enough but having to go through Nintendo before uploads and having no certainty that their creation will ever make it to market is a death blow. Its unsustainable.Sorry for the essay dump lol.,nintendo,cvlhv03,2,t5_2qhnk

5298460,0,t1_cvot1vr,gt  its legal to download ROMs if you own a copyIts not. The only way a ROM could be argued as legal would be if it was a backup created under fair use but you would have to create the ROM file yourself using a cartridge dumper. You cannot download copies from others or websites and consider it a backup because it wasnt created under fair use. Nintendo purposely clouds matters on their various pages on the subject they claim that it is illegal to make copies of their games as well. But its not if I have a cartridge dumper and dump a SMW cartridge then play that dumped copy on an emulator Ive done nothing illegal as my creation of the copy and use of that copy for personal use falls under fair use. if I offer it for download that is another story of course!If you have a DS that is probably the best legal way to get SMB. The Wii Us NES emulator is surprisingly awful.I dont think it is wise to base ones morals on what is or is not legal since this effectively allows the creation or repeal of laws to change your moral framework because sometimes our systems will create legal answers that are themselves immoral. ,nintendo,cvoxtwe,2,t5_2qhnk

5393319,0,t3_3owe3h,Its completely a nonissue right now.. The emulator is currently closedsource so unless the creator of the emulator is a god at understanding how the Wii U works and is able to translate that into programming the emulator isnt going to run very well for a very long time.. The emulator has a bunch of problems asis. It currently runs at a blistering fps. Not  no  fps. If you look at the demo video of Wind Waker HD you can see all of these graphical issues instantly. Such as missing textures lighting effects looking off no sound and significantly slower gameplay even at the menu screen.. To give you a perspective on how long it will take for Wii U emulation to become worthwhile as in its better to emulate than to buy a console lets look at Dolphin.Dolphin was initially released in  as an experimental Gamecube emulator. It ran at rates of fps and didnt emulate audio until . It went opensource in  and gained stable Wii MENU Emulation by February . Still a ton of issues with sound textures and lighting. Now the dedicated team is at version . and most Nintendo produced games run flawlessly but there are still some minor issues with third party games.So  to . Thats a  year gap. I think Nintendo is safe from the Wii U emulator becoming an issue.As for this being wrong? No its not wrong. Emulators are available for nearly every console even the DS Xbox  and PS have emulators now.Pirating games is wrong but making emulators are not. The only legal issue I see is running the Wii U menu as thats copying and distributing Nintendos code. But the Dolphin Emulator also runs the Wii menu I believe so I think that by the time it can run the Wii U menu it will be fine.,nintendo,cw121rb,3,t5_2qhnk

5430454,0,t1_cw5rrin,gt Id have to disagree with you on this though they did a pretty great job with WWHD which was more than just better graphics and minor repacing. It felt like a fresh game with much more intuitive controls. it was really just make it work on WiiU which includes using the gamepad gyro and having better graphics combined with some minor repacing.  they didnt add any new content like some of the cut content from before or optional stuff etc...  And even removed the tingle tuner for honestly no reason.  yes there is no GBA connection but the WiiU can still connect to DS and the gamepad itself could have acted like the tingle tunergtbut I genuinely had a good time playing it and I think thats the goal.

Most reviews compare Fatal Frame with what? Silent Hill? The original Resident Evil?? Fatal Frame comes from a dying breed of games with a cult following.

Heck maybe some of them already do play it but in secret.The problem isnt that youre an adult playing a game perceived to be for children.

That being said Star Fox Zero was delayed and I doubt Nintendo wants to waste that sweet sweet crosspromotion opportunity. Then I thought it would be a Nintendo newcomer however based on the notion that we have not heard anything relevant for awhile I believe they want to kick off the presumably second half of DLC strong. It could always be a different thirdparty character but I believe that Banjo is the most likely given that the only real thing going against him is that he is owned by Microsoft which is more or less not detrimental if Nintendo is serious about their E mission statement. ,nintendo,cwx61f1,1,t5_2qhnk

5698104,0,t3_3t414v,The Pokemon Company is a separate entity from Nintendo and for whatever reason their standards for how their IP is used tends to differ from Nintendos. The vibe I get is that theyre almost possessive about it  that theyre all too happy to go with just about any concept when theyre the ones who pitch it but refuse to play ball when the ball is in another companys court. This is why the Pokemon content in nonPokemon Nintendo titles is minimal and why there are very few Pokemon spinoffs developed by outside companies and the ones that are like Koei Tecmo and Namco Bandai are kept on a pretty short leash. This could in turn lead to wondering why it feels like TPCi has gotten kinda lazy lately coasting on nostalgia and brand appeal and producing games that are generally underwhelming.On a similar note I cant help but wonder if this is why Nintendo has been so eager to take a big stake in Yokai Watch publishing the games internationally supporting development keeping the franchise Nintendoexclusive. Level seems to be much much more relaxed about how their IP is used so perhaps Nintendo is hoping that they can groom it into a second big monster franchise whose owners are easier to work with than TPCi.,nintendo,cx3eky4,11,t5_2qhnk

It was honestly kind of surreal at the time.A couple weeks later I went to Nintendo World NYC and picked up a copy of Excite Truck which I still absolutely love to this day and my first Classic Controller which I used to finally earn  stars in Super Mario  for the first time.Man this thread brought back some really cool memories. Also got me nostalgic thinking about the first times Id ever got my hands on Super Smash Bros. Brawl Super Mario Galaxy Metroid Prime  Corruption etc. Truly unforgettable experiences.,nintendo,cx6394v,8,t5_2qhnk

5804590,0,t3_3uo8gh,Personally I would try to get all of them not all at once eventually including Tropical Freeze. All are great but from personal experience I would rank it. Super Mario Maker amp SMDWIf you like to design and play fancreated levels. Super Mario Maker is THE hardest and funnest scroller Mario game to dateIf you have a friend or  than SMDW will be a blast. The game is just great and sometimes chaotic fun. Even in the single player the amazing but to fully experience it would be the multiplayer.Deciding the two of these games is purely preference. Rayman LegendsThe game is great especially with friends. Wacky comedy and fun. Beautiful artwork and will last you a while.. NSMBUIts Mario its great. The only problem is it is similar to the previous New Super Mario Bros. for Wii. It does have a new powerup but it is easily forgettable.

If you look back to the beginning of our conversation today we talked about the transition from Wii hardware to the Wii U hardware and how difficult it is to explain to the consumer base what is different and new about the new hardware. Its difficult to convince them to switch from their current platform to the next platform.That being said I can assure you were not building the next version of Wii or Wii U. Its something unique and different. Its something where we have to move away from those platforms in order to make it something that will appeal to our consumer base.As for the codename NX I dont believe that theres any real meaning behind it and to be perfectly honest I dont know where it came from says Kimishima laughing when I ask. Or perhaps Mr. Iwata had meant to tell me and then never got the chance.I wonder how much different it will be and in what direction. Hes put a lot of emphasis that it will be a break from the Wii and Wii U I wonder if that means no backwards compatibility? ,nintendo,cxlrhtd,8,t5_2qhnk

But your example is terribly contrived and involves significantly changing how the whole game works its not a good analogy to Smash or the subject of balance patches at all. Also you point out that Pokemon has other design choices that are meant to cater to high level players when this whole issue comes from that fact that Sakurai refuses to ever do that.Dont you see how its a little insulting that any time Sakurai ever mentions high level play  literally every single time I dare you to find a single article or interview where he ever says something different  his very next thought is oh but what if it ruins the game for beginners? Reading between the lines its pretty clear this is his way of saying he wont do anything at all to cater to the high level.This really isnt a serious concern as proven by the fact that he already successfully made two games that did a perfect job of being enjoyable to both casual and hardcore players alike.

Who knows why they make so many of their ridiculous decisions? Seriously its a mystery. Nintendo isnt exactly the most competent company these days. Honestly the only explanation that seems plausible to me is the same explanation nintendo has given for why GBA games arent on the DS store which is that they werent able to implement features of other VC games like save states menus etc. and so they arent up to their arbitrary standards that most people wouldnt even care about. ,nintendo,cxplbzc,-2,t5_2qhnk

5934882,1,t3_3wldoi,I think that Nintendo should consider simply becoming a thirdparty developer. I know youre already clicking downvote but hear me out.I feel like all of Nintendos current problems come from its hardware exclusivity and the fact that they simply dont have enough draw to be as competitive as the Xbox and PS anymore they just occupy their own niche. By having their games on all consoles possible... They would make way more money. Tons of people would buy the latest Smash Bros for Christmas but plenty of these people have moved on to other consoles and arent interested in buying a Wii U specifically for Nintendo games. Arguably this would allow them to have a greater influence on modern gaming culture than they currently have since they would be relevant to a lot more gamers. They can take advantage of the latest console hardware instead of having to provide it themselves often to their own detriment.  They can take advantage of the online infrastructures that Sony and Microsoft have built and are way ahead of Nintendo in as well as the increasingly competitive ecosystems both are providing like Microsofts ability to stream to Windows  and rumours that Sony is working on it. We dont have to have this Nintendo is doomed discussion anymore. No one is arguing their ability to make games although I guess some are saying theyve stagnated for a while its mainly an issue of marketing their hardware and culture relevance. Ultimately  of Nintendo games can be played with an Xbox or PS controller. Hell you could probably replicate a lot of Wii U gamepad features with a tablet or even just release your own third party controller.As someone who loves all games and is not interested into being locked into one company I would love for this to happen. Currently the Wii U is just a consoles I have to buy and tolerate to play cool Nintendo games. The gaming world is much bigger than Nintendo for me and I wish they didnt require their own hardware.EDIT DS is a different story. Talking mainly about consoles here.,nintendo,cxxle0m,3,t5_2qhnk

Press it again to detonate. The bomb only detonates when triggered manually or when hit by an attack. It can be thrown at an opponent without detonating it for some damage or left on the stage to block opponents.These two are variants of the moves he already has so its a bit more like what they did with Luigi...and heres a taunt to replace the fairy taunt that normal Link has Link takes out his Picto Box and takes a selfphoto with a random expression.

6220612,0,t3_40rqoz,Splatoon. Its crazy how much I still play that game. Not quite as crazy as how much they place Urchin Underpass in the Stage Rotation. Quit with the Urchin Underpass Nintendo. I wanna play at Arowana Mall and Saltspray Rigs every once and a while yknow.Ive been playing the additional levels in Boxboy. Dangtheyre tricky. I have no idea how to get all the crowns much less move forward. Luckily HAL Labs is smart and let me playthrough other worlds expecting me to get stuck. Ive also never beaten Some of the time trials so nows a prime time for that.Lastly Ive continued playing Super Dodge Ball Wii U. Ugh! I nearly beat the U.S.S.R.on difficult mode. I dont know how much motivation I have to start from the beginning in hopes to beat the U.S.S.R. again because I have to beat like  other teams which are also pretty difficult before that. Which leads me to my biggest issue with this game. Once its game over you go back to the start. Thats not atypical in arcadeports. However youre usually given more lives and a chance to score some lives. You dont get that in Super Dodgeball. You lose on your th game you have to beat the first  the same way you did before. No way to level up no way to avoid using lives. Its useless for me to do that. But I guess thats only one dumb aspect in an otherwise great NES Sports games and the best albeit only Dodgeball game Ive ever played.Other games Im playing Kirby Triple Deluxe Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer Super Mario Maker amp Chibi Robo Zip Lash,nintendo,cywpsqd,2,t5_2qhnk

6284708,0,t1_cz3tr1n,Yes  this is the thing that is a bit maddening Its close to impossible to actually test one out and try it for yourself.  Nearly all demo units are XL versions.  Ive heard a couple GameStops let individuals try out one of the Happy Home Designer models in the store but no GameStops around me will open an unopened box to let me check one out.  Ive basically searched around for the store with the most reasonable return policy hoping that in the event I dont like it Ill be able to get a return but well see.  I know GameStop and Target wont let you return an opened DS.  Walmart I think would allow it but I dont see the Pokemon bundle available there.  I dont even want the Pokemon games or faceplates but Ill probably be able to sell those faceplates to pay for something I do want more easily than trying to sell the Animal Crossing plates otherwise Id get the HHD bundle at Walmart.  As far as the differences between the units Ive been looking into this for the last week and you will get different answers from different people that all seem to boil down to  it depends.  Maybe your hands will be fine but the screen will look too small.  Maybe the screen is okay but your hands cramp up.  I used to hold my OG DS by using my pinkies to stabilize it in my hands but the sharpish edges of the OG made this a little uncomfortable will the NDSs rounder edges help or will the cartridge placement and power button make my pinkiehold unmanageable?  Maybe you dont like the white color because its more of an off white color.  Maybe the matte face plates smudge or scratch more easily than the NXLs surface but maybe the matte texture makes the device more pleasing to hold while youre playing.  Its just a shame that its so difficult to try one out ahead of time and its also a shame that although Nintendo claimed that white devices dont sell in NA thats all theyve offered as an option for the standard NDS the device they said wouldnt be coming to NA at all last year.    ,nintendo,cz4010s,2,t5_2qhnk
6286485,0,t1_cz3p2c7,Mother s combat is incredibly engaging because of timed hits but Earthbound is pretty slog like until the last half of the game where you have all party members. Battles dont really get intense until you actually get the opportunity to strategize beyond just landing regular hits. Later game you get to use PSI shields learn what kind of shields enemies are using to figure out whether to blow through PSI moves or regular attacks and using Jeffs awesome toolsets or PaulaPoos tanky PSI attacks. But...thatd require you to spend a good  hours just to get to the good combat. ,nintendo,cz47asr,1,t5_2qhnk

I would really play the same games a lot. A new game meant dozen of hours even if it was mediocre. I remember spending afternoons trying to collect all items and clear the first level in The Ren amp Stimpy Show Fire Dogs when it was objectively a frustrating and fairly mediocre game.Nowadays I have way more games.

Nope honestly havent seen much about it beyond the historical importance of the system.   I played duck hunt at a friends house once thats pretty much the only experience Ive had with the peripherals.EDIT since everyone seems to be sharing their first exposure to games I grew up in a hick small town and my parents were gaming illiterate.  I didnt get a gaming system until I was  years old in the form of a Gameboy advance this took  years of nearconstant begging.  I was only bought pokemon and shovelware of whatever popular animated movie was out until I was old enough to buy my own games.  I also desperately wanted a gamecube but never got one and only was able to play Melee at a friends house.  I didnt get an actual home console until the Wii came along and got my family convinced it could be a family thing.

Im not sure how easy it is for Nintendo to port their games over so I dont know for sure if the price reflects that but if you look at it like this Nintendo is a business and theyll charge as high as they think people are willing to pay. They could just as easily charge  or  dollars if they wanted but I guess they decided  was as high as they could go for SNES and GBA games.So maybe it is overpriced but its just business to them. As long as people are willing to pay it then thats the price they are going to charge. If you want them to lower it youll have to convince literally everybody buying virtual console games right not to stop buying them until they lower their prices.

In other words its a way to turn a discussion into a debate and win it from your own perspective by having the final word forming it as a fait accompli Youre a fanboy and so you are incapable of having a rational discussion despite your attempts at simulating rationality.Its really a broad problem that affects all aspects of society.Edit To answer the question what makes a rampant fanboy? Id say everything and nothing its all subjective. Its not like theres a bar for what a reasonable statement is in regards to what one likes and doesnt like. Even if I said But I like being disappointed. you cant tell me  I dont because my brain may work differently. I may simply enjoy experiencing a variety of emotions for the way they broaden my understanding of myself.

6366255,0,t3_42ssgl,This sub seems pretty  on Nintendos account system. Ive been both downvoted AND upvoted separate posts though I think I was only downvoted just for the snarky way I talk sometimes for being critical of Nintendos one DS per accountone Wii U per account thing and also lack of cross buy for titles that are . identical between platforms like VC and some indie games. In one post I used a smartphone as an example  if you get a new smartphone of the same brand you can easily just log into your old account and redownload all your apps as opposed to Nintendos system transfer method that requires you to have both systems on hand and only one system per account. Someone actually told me but a DS isnt a smartphone and a smartphone isnt a DS as a counterargument yeah no shit but a PS PS PSP and PS Vita arent smartphones either yet theyre all gaming systems with a proper unified account system.As to actually answer your questions. I think people mean fanboyism when theyre referring to people that defend anything that involves comparing Nintendos account services to one of its competitors. Particularly its account system and its lack of features when compared to the account systems used by Sony Microsoft Apple and other companies these features being crossbuy and also the ability to transfer accounts to another system without having to jump through a bunch of hoops and the ability to add systems to an account and immediately have access to all content already purchased on that account..

Because of time travel both timelines are allowed to exist at the same time. Dying isnt part of the story and it cant exist at the same time as the other timelines.One way I can fudge it in my mind is what happens to the timeline each time young link leaves it by heading to the future or adult link leaves the future by heading to the past?

OoT as well if theyre getting introduced into Zelda? Or if you want to play it lol. Id suggest animal crossing as well if they like to play more casual games!Edit to answer more questions..Mario kart requires only one cartridge. You can use download play for the others you just dont get to choose a character or kart setup. Smash..I think you need multiple cartridges someone correct me if Im wrong. Amiibo functionality in that one. Animal crossing youll need multiple cartridges if they want to make their own towns and visit them but if they can deal with being in one town and not fighting over who gets to be mayor one cartridge is enough. ,nintendo,czt5p0e,3,t5_2qhnk

6549315,0,t3_459soe,I kid you not Zelda in Smash  is literally broken. Its a joke. Despite being in low tier shes devastating. Ive used all the good characters in my book and Zelda is still destructing. Ive been using good characters like Fox and Ness by the way. Its not that I am bad I am a very skilled player. Let me list all of the flaws Zelda has.She moves too fast  She rarely has any lag in any of her moves. Most of her abilities spew out of her like its nothing. She shields and dodges WAY too fast to dodge all my attacks. Its lightning speed. When I try to dodge like that its too slow and I get hit.Her abilities are overpowered  Dins Fire is like a Call of Duty gun. Itll keep shooting at you until youre dead. For example When Im Ness and try to recover guess whats coming my way? Yep Dins Fire. Another one is Nayrus Love. Oh boy dont get me started with this one. As I said previously she is very fast. She can easily unleash this attack in an instant with barely any lag. When I try to approach she dodges WAY too fast as I said before and after she dodges guess what happens after? Nayrus Love. What a freaking joke. And heres the BIGGEST one of them all. Farores Wind. I cant describe this in words. Its so... AHHGHGHGHGH! This is like one of the most broken specials she has. When youre right stacked up on her she can use it make you lift up in the air and when she reappears its all over. You cant DI out of it. Its a freaking joke. Why could Sakurai do this?Her hitboxes are a joke  She hits you even if youre not hit. Shes hard to hit as well sometimes.Now lets recap Shes a broken character. Dont let her bad tier fool you she is broken and people have yet to realize her potential. Im so outraged right now and I hope you can understand my situation.If you dont believe me then I ask for you to go up against a Zelda player and see how much of a joke she really is.Thank you.,nintendo,czwr47i,-2,t5_2qhnk

While the game is technically ever in a nowin state if Palutenas Divine Guidance is shining down on you and throwing the RNG in your favor every attack I can agree that allowing you to permanently back yourself into the position like that isnt the best. The best way I think to combat that though is to make sure youre receiving new units every few levels to assure youre never with too few soldiers to win with enough thought. I havent read too much into the game before this review as Im trying to avoid spoilers so I dont know how often youre presented with new units but I cant really think of any better way to balance the game without giving you the ability to just use the balancing function until youre way more powerful than anything else.It was my biggest gripe about Awakening actually the S Supports encouraged you to grind to get them up get all the kids and get everyone linked together. Then as a result of it the ending missions of the game were ridiculously easy when you could one or twohit the final bosses of the game. I literally ended Awakening by just sending my Avatar and his wife into it to tank everything and kill the final boss in a grand total of three turns. It felt very anitclimactic that the toughest missions of the game happened about halfway through and then as soon as I could get the children the game became too easy because I wanted them all and that involved having to grind for support and insane amounts of EXP came along with that process.,nintendo,d03puk8,2,t5_2qhnk

6665540,0,t1_d07uybt,From my perspective looking back on a childhood where I along with one good friend tended to play Geno and Mallow instead of cowboys and indiansGeno sort of feels like an adult among children. Everyone else is silly shounenmanga character tropes having silly squabbles Geno is on a mission from God doing something actually important. He never quips or warms up to or otherwise joins the team this mission for him is his jobhes on the clock while hes here. And hes a consummate professional he never groans or sighs about having to deal with anything. Hes like Shadow from FF but without the mercenary HanSololike just here as long as I feel like it feeling. Hes here because his job is to be here.And yetfor a large part of the gamehe overpowers everyone else on the team. He couldand was planning tosucceed at his task on his own. Youre really the ones who are tagging along on his mission.I would compare the love for Geno to the love for Auron from FFX. Auron makes the archetype clear hes your dads cool friend who looks out for you like a dad but without any of that sort of authoritarian keep you safe by telling you whats Not Allowed vibe he would have if he actually were your dad. Hes just some guy who gets stuck with you and takes on making sure youre safe as a secondary goal after whatever his first goal was.,nintendo,d08rw9f,6,t5_2qhnk

The DS games came relatively late in the DS cycle as did the first DS games IIRC. I dont think its a given that a new generation will release on the NXnext handheld. I think TPC considers userinstall base in these decisions.Also while the gap between generations is  yearish announcements between generations usually took around  years. Were little behind schedule with Gen  in that regard and theyve been teasing a Z version so hard it would be weird to not receive a followup game to XY.

6701267,0,t3_47exby,Some of the older Legend of Zelda concept art was done in a style similar to that of the animated Lord of the Rings the animated Hobbit Wizard Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind Princess Mononoke The Black Cauldron Secret of Nimh etc. I would love to see a Zelda game made with more of a focus on that older style of Western Fantasy. The first two Zelda games did a great job of capturing that feeling of a desolate destroyed world devoid of hope but full of unique creaturesenemies and magic. ALTTP made everything a little more colorful and full of other people. Which dulled the sense of adventure for me. OOT brought back that sense of adventure but by filling the world with so much to explore. It truly felt like the semicheerful world before LoZ. I just really want to see a Zelda game that takes place in a world around the time of LoZ or AoL with that lone explorer hopeless desolate landscape leaving you to explore empty ruins on your own without the help of various NPCs telling you what to do and the narratives and history. ,nintendo,d0cgwbg,20,t5_2qhnk

The multiplayer which I spent many hours on when I was younger now feels really bland and offers so few options. The single player feels unfair out of some bad design. Enemies seem to go from tons of telegraphing to none or next to none. Often I have no idea what hit me. Maybe there just needs to be a bit more structure. Thats how I feel.

6858873,0,t1_d0tqo8o,I think theres a big difference between a Zeldastyle adventure game and a rd person adventure. Ocarina of Time was pretty much the first rd person adventure but since then it has evolved into a very wide genre. The Elder Scrolls and The Witcher series are great games in their own right but they dont share many gameplay features with Zelda. As far I can tell Zelda has never focused on narrative choice or customizing your character its always been about the puzzlesolving and the finding secrets and exploration in general. The one thing Elder Scrolls does share with it is exploration and side quests  but even then they go about it in different ways. The Elder Scrolls began as an RPG and still retains many of those elements Zelda has never been an RPG despite the fantasy setting. I respect your opinion but personally wouldnt have wanted Zelda to become that sort of game there are few other games quite like it. ,nintendo,d0trgbl,5,t5_2qhnk

6862255,0,t1_d0u4h33,I would say some do it better than others. I respect your opinion its a very arguable point that the heros quest archetype doesnt really inspire much in the hearts and minds of modern men. But it still has an innate appeal to me. The Odyssey doesnt bother too much with a complicated story before propelling the hero on his adventure but its been passed down through the ages because that story triggers something in peoplea yearn for their own adventure. Zelda games play up on this dynamic. In a way I might argue the more context and exposition the more diminished the effect of the adventure that follows since at some point the story will need to be about the context and not the adventure itself.Then again something like The Last of Us writes a beautiful story and focuses on its characters while taking us through an adventure story. Yet when I remember that game fondly I think of smaller moments between Joel and Ellie and not much of their grand adventure except for maybe the giraffes that was cool.Its just a different approach and you can have a preference for either.For my part Im engaged whenLink watches his sister get captured by a giant bird and carried across the vast ocean...Link gets pulled through the a mysterious black wall by a strange creature unlike any in the preceding two hours of gameplay... fuck ColinLink finally dives through the clouds to see the world below...Link emerges from the forest to see the wide expanse of Hyrule open before him...Sure theyre simple but also absolutely engaging.

Items are a mix of modern industrial technology and ancient magitek.gtAn original gimmick ex. sailing wolf etc.You are given sets of objectives dungeons to clear at a time and the situation you deal with gets worse the later you deal with it. For example a coastal village is being attacked by pirates from a nearby fort and some underground monster is producing poison gas that is killing the farmlands above it. Doing the pirate fort first would cause the caves to have more toxic sections and the farm to die more but doing the caves first would allow the pirates to get better resources and the coast town to take more damage. Maybe you choose based on what hazards you are better at handling maybe you choose based on the urgency of the problem maybe you try to balance it. Whatever you choose you get freedom and a sensible difficulty curve and more strategic and emotional engagement.Post Spirit Tracks the flood has receded and Old Hyrule has been rediscovered. Its mountains are draped in the roots of the enormous trees at their peaks the fields are beginning to regrow their grass but they are dotted with ruins of the old world longforgotten shipwrecks dried up coral reefs and the skeletal remains of enormous seabeasts. In the civilized world astronomers have determined that a comet is going to strike the earth during its next pass and that they are powerless to stop it. Fortunately it is not likely to cause too many deaths. Unfortunately it is going to wipe out the new old world and destroy a great deal of history with it.You play as the assistant to a famous archeologist who is studying this ancient land in the time it has left. To kick off the plot you arrive late to a dig to discover that ancient security automata have come to life in these ruins and trapped your peers and employer within. After destroying the boss automaton you find your group holed up with a mysterious old man with a scar on his forehead who has told them of the existence of the wishgranting Triforce which he says could be used to save this land from the imminent disaster. He had intended to find it himself for this very purpose but he realized during the crisis that he had become too frail for such a quest.After following a few of the old mans leads to a few dungeons you have failed to make any headway in finding the Triforce but discover a room with a mural depicting what appears to be of yourself in mortal combat with a younger version of the old man. When confronted he reveals that he was once an evil king from a dead kingdom who had his sights on world domination and that he believes you are a reincarnation of the heroic child who had thwarted him twice before. He had been magically sealed under the ocean for centuries during which he had a lot of time for introspection and that he vowed to be a better man if he were ever freed.He gives you a metal fragment saying that it was a piece of the divine blade that had trapped him for so long. He awoke from his sealing to a heavy storm and assumes that the sword was struck by lightning or debris to have shattered like it did and release him. He tells you that he believes you to be its rightful holder and hopes that it can protect you from evil even in this state.The Master Shard calls to you in your mind beckoning you in several directions and giving you visions of landmarks from the ancient world. Following these clues you find the three scattered Triforces in dungeons created by an ancient Hyrulean king to safeguard them while your boss is in correspondence with the New Hyrulean royal family.Upon collecting the last piece you are confronted outside the entrance to the most recent dungeon by Princess Zelda who is accompanied be her personal guard. She has stolen the pieces that you had left with the archeologist and demands that you give her your final piece. She reveals that her family had always secretly known of the Triforce and that they had kept it secret because of the history of conflict it had caused claiming that losing it beneath the ocean was the best thing ever to happen to humanity. She says that simply wishing the comet away would cause investigation as to why it failed to hit which would draw attention to any remaining stories of the Triforces existence which could put the world back into cyclical turmoil. But a carefully constructed wish could both save the land and preserve deniability.Convinced by her argument you hand over your last piece. Using the Triforce she asks it to show her how to avert the crisis. It reveals an ancient superweapon beneath Old Hyrule. A cannon capable of firing immense magical energy that also happens to be located directly beneath the projected point of impact. It could be turned upward and fired into the sky to destroy the threat but would be destroyed in the process due to centuries of disrepair. And they key to accessing it is the Master Sword ensuring that it could only be used for good.Using your Master Shard you track down the Swords fragments to their resting places like you did the Triforces. Each has been taken as a talisman like your own and each is given to you in exchange for a heroic deed.Upon reforging the Master Sword you enter the final ruin which is the final dungeon and blow shit the fuck up and save the day.,nintendo,d0vq8hg,1,t5_2qhnk

Why nintendo decided that it was a good idea to put people who might be  in immediate contact with people that might be  I will never know. but its seems like an obviously stupid idea on paper doesnt it? It WAS cool as hell at launch though. Mostly because almost everyone was grown could take a joke and could strike that perfect balance between sarcasm and inappropriate innuendo even if they couldnt draw. I remember drawing momiji cleavage for the ninja gaiden  section and since that went well I also did catwoman on all fours in the arkham city board arcee with her hands on her hips and finally a black optimus prime laying down that said youll never know transformers pain like we do because OUR optimus died on the transformers board.

People who enjoy a gamefilmtv show are more likely to say how much they enjoyed it then move on. Whereas people who hate a gamefilmtv show will keep going on about how much they dont like it. Eventually all the people who talk positively about it have moved on to something else they enjoyed and all thats left is a circlejerk of people who cant stop talking about how much they dislike this thing.  If you want an example of this just look at the Star Wars fanbase.

7041892,0,t3_4bzvwc,I definitely liked Galaxy  way more. I remember playing Galaxy  right on the heels of the original and there were a couple of things that irked meAtmosphere of course Galaxy  felt less spacey and mysterious and waay too cheerful whats with all the blue skies anyways?! isnt it supposed to be in space?World Map I really didnt like the NSMBesque approach to the world map. Sure it was more streamlined but I felt that the solarsystem type world map in the first game fitted the theme of the game much better. iirc it also gave you much more freedom in skipping levels I recall that I did very little in the engine room beat the boss finished the garden and then went back and finished the engine room later.World Design galaxy  had a healthy mix of large and small planets. Even if it was still linear to an extent the fact that huge planets like Honeyhive and Beach Bowl helped immerse the player. The fact that you had to do  missions per galaxy helped me fall in love with each galaxy even more. Even still Galaxy  had its fair share of linear platforming across smaller planetoids giving a healthy mix of both.Galaxy  on the other hand had way too many D segments. I last played the game a long time ago but I remembered getting extremely frustrated at all of the D missions in the game. Even when it wasnt D the levels were all extremely linear and set up more like obstacle courses than actual consistent worlds. The fact that there were only  real missions per galaxy made it even harder to actually fall in love with the galaxies like I did with the original.Green Stars One of the things that irritated me the most when I first played was the inclusion of the green stars. Even then it just came off as lazy lets just slap a bunch of stars in random places and make the player look for them in previous missions!. Unlike say the hidden stars in Super Mario  you could only access these after the initial  star quest which forces the player to tackle them specifically. Rather than being a cool oh I found a secret! Awesome! moment that happened while playing the main missions it became a slog that got boring quick.The worst part of the green stars however is that they added them in to make the mission count per galaxy  level  just like in the original. The problem is that they just feel like tacked on filler content and they dont help the player fall in love with the world or anything. They just feel like a homework assignment that happens after the initial  star quest.Story I cant really explain it but the first story was just much grander in its presentation. It really felt like there was something at stake. Rosalinas backstory was interesting as well but the whole context of the journey just gave the player a grand sense of purpose that had never been seen before in a main series Mario game.I just didnt get that feeling from the story in Galaxy . Ik its more subjective but thats just my opinion.Conclusion People love to hate on Mario D World for making everything much more linear. In all honesty however Galaxy  was no better just a linear obstacle course platformer with a space theme to it.Its worth noting that Galaxy  has some wonderful exceptions to what Ive listed for example Starshine Beach was awesome as a galaxy it was extremely atmospheric and the Piantas really immersed me and helped me fall in love with the world. There were also some galaxy concepts that set up an excellent atmosphere and wouldve had great potential with more missions and larger more open levels Slimy Spring Galaxy was a criminal waste of potential for example. Overall Galaxy  was a game that left me sorely disappointed. It took much of what I loved about Galaxy  and just did away with it and what was left felt linear bland and sometimes downright lazy. Either give me a Galaxyesque game or fully embrace the concept of a linear D platformer compromising between the two yields nothing but disappointment. I think Mario D World was vastly superior to Galaxy  for this reason it went full out with the linear concept and turned out great.EDIT Sorry for the text wall TLDR I liked Galaxy  more because of the atmosphere story and level design.,nintendo,d1ek0ey,3,t5_2qhnk

7164850,0,t1_d1sdyyi,I disagree. Sorry incoming wordwall because Ive actually thought a lot about this. Prepatch Sheik was undisputedly the best in the game having alarmingly high representation and results. The metagame was defined by this character I could see an argument for ZSS as well but good as she was she wasnt nearly as prominent as Sheik. There was passive albeit reasonable discussion on whether or not Sheik would end up being a lesser Brawl Meta Knight in the sense that using her granted the player a significant advantage over the rest of the cast which would lead to less character diversity something that was further supported when Ally threatened to drop Mario for Sheik or ZSS and Nairo saying that he was considering a secondary because he felt overwhelmed by the SheikZSS matchup. Sheik wasnt just good prepatch she was meta defining to the point that people top players especially were already showing signs of fatigue from her inclusion... and no one talked about it. Then the nerf happened ZeRo made a video saying Bayonetta would be toxic and granted what was formerly a vocal minority the validation they needed to bring BAN BAYONETTA to the forefront. Side note Im in no way dogging ZeRo for making the video but the politics of bothering to discuss Bayonettas toxicity as a prepatch Sheik player was not lost on me. Much of the evidence was and still is due to a lack of knowledge about the character and is founded on theorycraft. The fact still stands that Bayonetta has not won a major Mewtwo won a major before Bayonetta and its also worth mentioning that her easy bake combos rely on reading DI are not guaranteed and stop working at higher percents see Pink Freshs performance in Pound  and his losses. The meta is thus far not having to accommodate to her... like at all. In a few monthstoayear if theres evidence that shes actually game breaking assuming a patch does not nerf her? Then consider banning her but a ban on Bayonetta also rids players of matchup experience assuming international playshe is ever unbanned due to a future nerf. Banning her doesnt stop players from labbing her. I understand just not enjoying the matchup which I genuinely believe is the biggest issue here but people said the same thing about Rosaluma and they finally sucked it up and learned. Top players shy of ZeRo I guess? also dont really have a problem with her at all. I have yet to see anyone complain about Bayonetta outside of the initial shock of how she played on release week but maybe thats my own ignorance. To my knowledge at least the pros handle it like pros and I see no reason why anyone should handhold the community in regards to her or expect anything less of them too especially with so little evidence to suggest shes actually damaging to the metagame. Anyway that was a tangent and I got off topic. My point is yes it is incredibly hypocritical to ban Bayonettagive her shit when prepatch Sheik got off fine even though she already showed signs of toxicity in the community.,nintendo,d1skpl9,13,t5_2qhnk

7170459,0,t3_4dokma,Its really interesting because I think theres been a lot of experimentation in each hardware generation but the focuses have been different.With Nintendo  there was really an attempt to define what D games would be. Nintendo unquestionably led the way with D game design and technology for the entire industry for the most part. Their influence was profound even outside the console space.GameCube was a refinement of much of this. There were elements of GameCube that were philosophically precursors to Wii. Think back to the GameCube controller design Nintendo started the process of simplifying the design with an aim to appeal to nongamers.Nintendo had learned a lot about D game design and they could start doing more with it  thus games like Metroid Prime which were highly creative.Then you get to the Wii era. I think its sad that there were some gimmicky aspects because fundamentally the Wii and Wii Remote were not mere gimmicks. Nintendo knew what they were doing there. There was a very strong attempt to create something highly intuitive that would set a new starting line for all players as Iwata phrased it.Then you have Wii U which  despite the fumbling  is at least conceptually quite clever. You can see how its an attempt to take the foundation laid by Wii and extend that into something more sophisticated.So I dont know I think Nintendo are as imaginative and creative as ever. Experiences like Miitomo really validate that. I think they are probably taking the biggest risks now than they ever have before actually.It really makes me wonder what the NX will be like and how risky it will be.,nintendo,d1t7pn3,3,t5_2qhnk

7204645,0,t1_d1x3rr7,I understand and Im pretty sure it works perfectly fine. Somehow its not how much I have to do its the fact that I have to do something.For instance A few directs ago I bought galaxy  on the VC since I never got a chance to play the original. However after buying it dawned on me that I couldnt play with a controller of course you still have to play it with a wiimote how are you going to control the cursor otherwise. So to play it I have to grab the sensor bar and put it in a good position I cant put it on top of my monitor due to a slanted angle and it wont register right below it for some reason so it has to stand on the front edge of my desk stand up move my chair back a foot and find out where and how far I can move the wiimote while keeping the sensor active.Generally I wouldnt say galaxy  is a motion control heavy game yet I cant get myself to play it which occurs with many of those games.I think I may pick up zero after a while when its a bit cheaper but I just dont like the idea that I cannot play without either a standard controller or keyboardmouse.And that problem is on me not them but still. I would have liked the option to just play with a controller.,nintendo,d1x3zne,1,t5_2qhnk
7208953,0,t1_d1xkps6,I dont know about anyone else but Im buying an NX if it has Smash . Even if its identical to the one I already own. Theres a couple of scenarios that could happen if it gets a port Smash for Wii U port with nothing else added This would be the easiest option for the Big N. This wouldnt sell consoles unless people hadnt owned a Wii U prior. Maybe you get the DLC for free if you bought it on Wii U or DS. Smash for Wii U with all DLC packaged in.This would be a little bit of a step up but not much. Itd be more alluring to casual fans who are just getting into the game for the first time. Smash for Wii U  Smash for DS Golden EditionA master version of the DS and Wii U stagelists and modes in full HD. This is personally what Im hoping for at the least because then there will be a major reason for me to upgrade. You could also throw the DLC in here with the base game or have a free download if you bought it before.  Smash  Golden Edition with Ice ClimbersSame as before except throw in the Ice Climbers too. The only reason I think we might get Ice Climbers at all is that they tried to get them to work and there was a bit of an outcry. And we know they were getting them into the code supposedly the Wii U ran the early beta climbers just fine but the DS choked so it wouldnt be that much of a stretch to add them as an incentive. Hypothetically they could throw Wolf in too but to keep it realistic Id say just the ICs. If they do anything to add new content or merge the two versions of the game at the very least the competitive community will all hop ship for the NX version. Otherwise if its just a basic port or DLC packaged version it wont matter. ,nintendo,d1xlnm7,7,t5_2qhnk

The fact that Nintendo has designed their hardware with rd party support as an afterthought is very telling of how disconnected they are from the mainstream gaming industry.

7242190,0,t3_4el8lh,Started playing a translated version of Fire Emblem Heroes of Light and Shadow FE.  At least so far it takes a lot of the things I did not like about Shadow Dragon such as most characters having  lines throughout the whole game and fixes them with things like support conversations.  Also this game has a zoomed out map so now I kinda understand the geography of the continent which was another issue I had with Shadow Dragon.  Not Nintendo related at all but I also bought Garrys Mod yesterday since it was on sale I didnt have it yet and I remember it being all the rage like  years ago.

Which would you rather Pay for  SCART Cable with Shipping or the  Component cables before shipping?So I chose to go with the go with something that made my GC image quality look great for  of the price of excellent image quality.

7322135,0,t1_d2aab89,Im also playing it on NDS. Are those frame rate issues only present on the DS port? Or is it smoother on Wii U? I started the game on Wii U but got sidetracked a while back. With this being available in a portable package Im finding that its easier for me to jump into for quick bursts and digest that way. Im not in love with it yet but cant deny its charm and have been playing nearly every day since release. I totally agree that it smacks together the summer vacation and epic adventure feel. Im hoping that at some point I fall in love with it since it seems that you either love it or dont get it. The thing I have the hardest time with is figuring out how to regenerate PP. It seems like the best bet is to stay at a hotel. Paulas praying seems to backfire as often as it helps and it seems like shes mostly good for PSI attacks as her physical damage is the lowest out of the three characters I have so far. Status effects are a pain to deal with... Little ghosts and colds are pretty annoying. All that said I really like the atmosphere and soundtrack. The gameplay isnt what I had expected at first textbased RPG which threw me for a loop and as such this is my third time getting into it. Im hoping I finish it. Looking at the list of upcoming releases for Wii U and DS I think Ill have a lot of time to play on my hands since there isnt much out there interesting me at the moment and this game has me pretty engaged. Right now I just waited three minutes inside of a waterfall and am looking forward to seeing what happens next. ,nintendo,d2ah5w4,3,t5_2qhnk

7323032,0,t1_d2ah5w4,The nice thing about Colds is theyre curable with PSI Healing alpha in fact you can cure almost all status effects except Mushrooms which almost never happen past Twoson or Lil Ghosts which DO make a comeback later in the game....fortunately their damage is negligible albeit annoying with Healing abilities that upgrade as the game goes on. Regenerating PP in the early game is basically Hotels later in the game you get plenty of free rest stops and most of all an easier time backtracking to those free stops. Theres some candies or treats that give you PP later on...but I only found a use for them in one particular boss later game. Praying is a risky dice throw almost never use it. Paula will be your goto PSI tank buff her up with the best Defense items because shes super vital to throwing out PSI moves until nearly the end game. PSI Freeze in all forms is your best singleenemy move and is a godsend to taking down bosses fast her Fire is nice with rows of enemies and Thunder I rarely thought worth using because like Prayer its pretty risky to use. When you get Jeff feed him every last IQ Capsule you come across and save those broken parts. He gets to use a lot of nifty equipment and almost all of it outside of the sprays are reusable almost infinitely. Ness is more of your healerphysical attack tank...and honestly I never quite figured out what Poo was best for other than cleaning up enemies and some better PSI moves but less PP than either Ness or Paula. ,nintendo,d2aku2j,1,t5_2qhnk

Return to Dream Land was supposed to come out in  for the GameCube. We watched as it got cancelled revised and cancelled again several times during the GameCube generation and the early years of the Wii. It finally came out at the tail end of the Wiis lifecycle at a time when nobody cared about the console anymore. And then our patience was rewarded by not getting any traditional Kirby games for the Wii U. And you know what? Our situation is still better than FZero fans or even Metroid fans. The point is Zelda fans have had it pretty damn good over the years. I think you guys can deal with one delayed game. Considering Zelda is one of Nintendos favored sons Im sure theyre going to bring it and make this game worth the wait.,nintendo,d2jl6to,2,t5_2qhnk

7411010,0,t3_4grzoy,I dont think thats a fair reading of the situation. Im hugely disappointed that the game is being delayed so much and the promise of Zelda did factor in though it wasnt the sole factor. I think most people who say its the sole factor are being hyperbolisticThe blowback on the Zelda situation is the culmination of all the disappointments of the WiiU but mostly people are upset because Zelda was the game that looked good it was pretty damn symbolic of the hope they had on the system that the game could offer something that was hardcore yet universally appealing.Its first announcement of  was fine. Disappointing that we got so little info outside of a more androgynous looking Link and a crazy spider tank but still the tail end of  was looking dense enough that we could actually be choosey with what new games we wanted if we wanted new games like if you wanted a new game in  and didnt like Pikmin you were pretty much out of luckThen it got pushed to  and it hurt.  was pretty darn barren. We had a sequel to a game so niche it only made it to the US because of extreme circumstances seriously NoA cant pull the pedigree game talk on Xenoblade. Marketed likely produced in partnership and distributed by Gamestop localized by NoE it was incredibly low risk another D platformer on a system that was already packed with admittedly mostly great D platformers the new squid on the block  was the only big summer release and was pretty clearly rushed and patched considering how little content was available at launch and Mario Maker was the big fall release. We went from one notable release a month which was already fairly slim pickings to one a quarter. On the horizon we had Starfox which looked problematic even then for being too loyal to  it seemed like a half hearted remake. The final product has been incredibly divisive even by those who got the hang of the controls and pretty much only Zelda. But now Zelda is being delayed again and if the NX is a home console successor to WiiU which we really dont know for sure it will almost certainly be the definitive version of the game.Were pissed because the constant delays and now the NX port is Nintendo giving up hope on the WiiU that weve been fighting so hard to keep up,nintendo,d2kl02s,-1,t5_2qhnk

Hilarious.Ok you mentioned music I assume this is what you meant by the mountain one? Sounded the TIIIIINIEST bit like Chrono Trigger  Corridors of Time but it progressed away from it as the song moved forward so Im fine. Still a bit repetitive sadly enough T Frankly Im not sure which I like more Dream Team  Somnom Woods along with the Dreamy variant or this one. I also heard Destination Unknown This was a bit repetitive like the mountain one but fantastic all the same. Sadly didnt go anywhere but had a great foundation if it was built upon and didnt just loop but actually progressed to some beautiful crescendo it would have the potential to be one of my favorite songs of this series like DreamySomnom Woods. Also heard Floating Castle of Doom Solid song really well done. Also crazy thing. This is probably the one song on youtube that actually sounds half way decent if you speed it up.

He seems to always want to oversimplify everything from a story or gameplay perspective and that makes for games that seem hollow or half finished.

I played  on the WiiU and sunk a lot of time into  over  hours.  introduced some fantastic mechanics which made fighting monsters a faster and fluid experience jump attacks and new combo options. If you are looking for something Dark Souls and enjoy farming materials for upgrades exploring different weapon types and engaging in nonturned based combat then I highly recommend the series. Additionally  had a much better ingame tutorial and the two new weapon types are a lot of fun to use as well.

In Paper Mario The ThousandYear Door to progress into the third chapter of the game Don Pianta Rogueports mob boss sends you to find his daughter and her fiance in exchange for a blimp ticket. My two brothers and I spent weeks looking for these two we scoured every available part of the game went back and reexplored the two previous boss dungeons played at various times of day assuming that may have been why we couldnt find them. We even tried to get to the bottom of the Pit of  Trials as a last ditch effort to find them. And just as we were about to give up I randomly wander back to the Rogueport docks the first area you arrive at in the game and lo and behold there they are.

7578493,0,t3_4j3zcy,It took the fighting game genre improved upon it and dragged it into the D era in a way that none of the more established series have really done. The purists wont want to hear this but I would easily rank Melee up there with the likes of Street Fighter II Soul Calibur and Mortal Kombat II in terms of both quality and importance to the genre.I think the series most impressive accomplishment has been churning out games that are accessible enough for casuals to pick up and play and have fun with while still providing plenty of depth for hardcore players to get into. Brawl being the exception of course as that game was a massive fuckyou from Sakurai to the competitive scene.Yes theres some valid complaints about the series  the oversizedscrolling stages i.e. Great Cave Offensive Icicle Mountain m Mushroomy Kingdom that nobody likes to play on tripping in Brawl leaving great characters out while the entire cast of Fire Emblem is forced in because reasons  but overall its provided me with  years worth of fun and counting.,nintendo,d33mztu,2,t5_2qhnk

All companies have lied. Is this something we cant acknowledge without getting downvoted because people are so insecure in their companies they need to pretend theyve never done wrong ever? I guess so.Personally not sure about the DS GBA situation. On the Zelda note Im pretty sure that was a lie because they said exclusively for wii u winter of last year. Were just now starting to near the end of spring and its NX as well. After saying how close to finish they were it feels like a lie to push to sell a new console lt my opinion. Maybe it isnt fact but nintendo has on purpose claimed something exclusive to get people to buy it before knee jerking last second to say multi console and push other things when people already bought it.Not all release set backs are lies no. They really arent a lot has to do with unknown setbacks. Bugs they found that werent there. Gameplay issues ect. But nintendo has more coincidental setbacks then immediate change of plans then any other company Ive seen. How many times can you say they didnt plan on before you start to feel they know people will buy things for a game they promise is exclusive or to be out my a certain date so they do it on purpose to move merchandise. I used to defend them to. Often but... as years pile on one another in the same routine? mm... I have to go with worst case scenario.,nintendo,d34qevm,-1,t5_2qhnk

7617793,0,t1_d38349a,Bayonetta is like God of Wars skill based action and crazy over the top combat but it doesnt take itself seriously. The game is hilariously aware of how silly it can be and the main character does the sexual innuendo and stuff in openly corny dialogue on purpose.Xenoblade is an action RPG with a MASSIVE world to explore and eventually you even get access to giant robots to kill even tougher enemies with. Its absolutely awesome and even has some online squad missions to take part in with a lot of others. Its a must have to me.And Mario Kart  is one of the best racers Ive ever played. The game doesnt feed you wins so a skilled racer can usually pull the lead but the items bring in the random factor so anyone can win the skill level just helps your odds unless you are one of the android Japanese people that boost perfectly off every available drift. The online is smooth the scoring isnt unfair and you get you use your own created Miis is you want instead of the Nintendo character racers. I liked Double Dash more but MK is the next best one in my eyes. Plus its a gorgeously colorful game.,nintendo,d383qjf,3,t5_2qhnk

Most importantly soaring still uses Pokemon while your suggestions would eliminate the need for Pokemon to explore the world which has always been a significant part of the games. Maybe if a number of physical attacks worked for Rock Smash or I could burn down trees with fire moves instead of Cut itd work better along with hiding that functionality later in the game.Worth considering is the non grid based nature of this gen may open up Surfing to be improved in some way.,nintendo,d3cb8a6,6,t5_2qhnk
7656305,0,t3_4jxbts,I think others have laid it all out pretty well here. One thing Id add is that Miyamoto is largely responsible for providing the creative incubator for upandcoming directorscreators.For instance Nintendos star game director in my opinion is Yoshiaki Koizumi. Koizumi has worked at Nintendo for a long time under Miyamotos guidance and leadership. And his credits are insane  he directed and was the principle creative force behind Super Mario Galaxy he created Donkey Kong Jungle Beat and he went on to own the Mario franchise as a Producer for the series. He was Assistant Director on The Wind Waker...and he largely came up with the original story and art for the Zelda earlier back on the NES.There are actually multiple great directors at Nintendo now. And though these people are extraordinary talented they have all been guidedmentoredled by Miyamoto.So his role as Creative Fellow or whatever its called now is as much about mentoring the team and nurturing future design leaders as it is about actual game production itself.,nintendo,d3ch9ht,1,t5_2qhnk

Its been a while but if I remember right in the post game there are treasure maps you can find that lead to dungeons with really powerful bosses that have great equipment but it drops really infrequently. You can repeat dungeons to try and get the bosss drops and I think with certain maps you can actually level up the boss by fighting it more to improve the reward for beating it.

7694400,0,t3_4kpudg,I have to separate them into two categories to rate them classic and New.Favorite Classic  SMB.  Loved the Arabian theme the character designs and how different it was and still is from anything else in the series from a game play standpoint.    Least Favorite Classic  Lost Levels.  Hard in a way that does not promote you to want to keep trying imo.  I see why this one didnt come out outside of Japan for a long time.    Favorite New Game  Kind of a tie between DS and Wii.  DS had a lot of personality and charm to it that was kind of wiped away from the later games in the series.  Wii was just a blast to play both solo and with friends and I was so stoked to see the Koopalings return after so many years.    Least Favorite New Game  for DS. I didnt mind the coin gimmick but found the levels themselves to be kind of clunkily designed and the power ups were disappointing as well.  ,nintendo,d3gsxvl,13,t5_2qhnk

This time around were looking at a week of young heroes and demonic hordes with a healthy dose of online action thrown in for good measure!As a side note A happy anniversary to Splatoon which hit Japanese retailers on May  . Next week will mark one full year on the charts!Quick AnalysisNintendoWhen looking at title counts this sales period was a pretty even match between titles on Nintendo and Sony hardware. Games on the Big Ns hardware claimed nine spaces this time around with  appearing on DS and  on the Wii U.The wrath of mechaKirby appears to be almost unstoppable at this point. Kirby Planet Robobot held tightly to its secondplace spot this period selling through  copies . Expect sales to pass  next week. While the Kirbot might be leading the charge its the samurai and ghostly garrisons that are heading up the second battalion. YoKai Sangokushi moved another  copies  LTD this week to claim the  space. Though its not likely to cross a million the title is ontrack to come within  by the time it exits the charts.Last week we also saw enrollment open for U.A. High School to train with the great All Might. My Hero Academia Battle for All DS launched at a modest th place with  sales for its debut. Given the popularity of the title and the general tie rate for licensed titles this is low. But really its a licensed title meaning little of value is being lost in this one. Its receiving belowaverage customers reviews and its been rewarded with belowaverage sales. Or to tldr this crazy paragraph Capitalism ho!Splatoon that shooter with squids kids and legs for days continues to tear up the lower half of the charts. The title managed to chart for its st consecutive week selling through  units  LTD to capture the splat zone at th place. But you know... itll never sell. Ill eat my crow now. Extra spicy please. Super Mario Maker continues to bring Mario into fans homes albeit through the most sadistic routes imaginable. The quirky spiritual successor to Mario Paint sold through  copies  LTD to land at th. Dragon Quest Monsters Joker  was right behind selling through  copies  LTD at th place. Fox McCloud continues to hang tough during his turbulent trip through the chars. The Star Fox Zero Star Fox Guard Double Pack landed at th place with another  sales  LTD. When we combine this to the most recent recorded sales for the standalone SKU  sales were looking at a combined total of . Its still not good but the title has sold better in its Media Create run than Tokyo Mirage Sessions FE  and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse .Animal Crossing New Leaf continues to enjoy its second life in the charts as fans are delighted by the laidback second life in the game. The title shifted  copies  LTD to build a new home at th. Mario amp Sonic at the Rio  Olympic Games barely qualified this round selling through a paltry  units  LTD to place at th.On the Hardware Front The DS sold through  units this period. The Wii U managed to pull itself out of funny story territory with  sales.SonyThe PlayStation family controlled the board again this period with  titles in the top . Of the titles that hit the charts six were PS offerings and four were Vita SKUs with one plucky PS game holding on.Whether its through his treasure hunting skills or roguish charm Nathan Drake managed to steal the top spot again this period. Uncharted  A Thiefs End sold through  units  LTD to claim first place. Though the title did drop off by  this is a normal and expected drop and nothing to be alarmed by.The revolution apparently wasnt televised this time. Rather it found its way to the PS. Homefront The Revolution opened at third place wth  units sold. Now to be blunt this is low. That said though this is also a title that would have greater appeal outside of Japan. Wait for the NPD numbers before you proclaim the sky to be falling.Speaking of revolutions the badasses rumbled once again in fifth place where Kenka Bancho Otome made its entrance. The title sold through  copies in its first week way down from the last installment in the series Kenka Bancho  Soul amp Blood DS which opened at  sales.The batting lineup seems to have been split this inning. While the three SKUs of Jikkyou Powerful Pro Baseball  appear in the charts they do seem to have found some real competition. The Vita version of the title led off hitting a long fly with  sales  LTD and a th place finish. The PS edition stepped up to the plate next grounding out at th with  units sold. The PS edition rounded out the lineup stepping up in the  spot with  units sold . Together the three hit home an impressive  sales to date.Demons seem to have invaded the top  and only DoomGuy can save us! The PS verision of Doom blasted its way through  copies to plant its sturdy boot at th place. Before you ask this was expected due to the small fanbse for Doom in Japan. I expect to see about    before the title leaves the charts entirely.Where Nintendo has Splatoon Sony has Minecraft. Mojangs blocky builder has become the highestselling Vita title in Japan by far and continues to be an evergreen title in the charts  months after launch. The game moved  units  LTD to build a shelter at th place.This is definitely a shooter week for PlaySatation fans. Battleborn blasted its way into th place this time around shifting  units to claim th place. On the bottom part of the charts the sexy adventure game Period Cube Torikago no Amadeus Vita launched at th with  units sold. Dying Light The Following   Enhanced Edition rounded out the top  lurching into the bottom spot with  copies reaching customers  LTD.On the Hardware FrontThis week the PS was the highestselling hardware again with  units reaching consumers during the period. The Vita also ahd a respectable showing this period with  units sold for the week. The PS held steady selling through  consoles.MicrosoftIn the world of finance the Rule of  is a mathematical formula used to determine the time it would take for an investment to double. Basically the rule number  in this case is divided by the interest percentage per period usually years to get the estimated time period for a full doubling to take place.In the Japanese marketplace even doubling the  XBox One consoles sold this period would still sting pretty badly.NeoGAF Link,nintendo,d3ml0gd,6,t5_2qhnk

7747706,0,t1_d3mlmn8,Yeah I know but compare that to say the Hyrule Warriors Legends limited edition which was available for the entire preorder period and is even still available now. Generally with video games limited edition means you should probably preorder it if you want it not you need to ensure you have constant internet access and keep your eyes glued to TwitterReddit constantly for a couple of months to stand a chance of getting it because you dont know when theyll list it for preorder and GAME preorders will sell out within about  hours and Nintendo UK Store ones in less than an hour.I managed to preorder the Fates limited edition for me from GAME and my best friend from Nintendo but I spent about three months worrying about it from hearing about how quickly the American version sold out to when they finally arrived on the day without getting cancelled or lost in the post. Even when I finally did manage to get the preorders I lost sleep over worrying that theyd get cancelled and Id be letting my friend down. People should never have to lose sleep over a video game except from staying up late playing it. I was offline for one evening and I missed the TMS FE preorders.The only good reasons for preorders for something to be that limited are Its something like concert tickets where theres a physical limit to how many they can make available due to the size of the venue or The only special thing about it is that its limited  for example first editions.With Fire Emblem Fates not only is there stuff like the art book that makes it desirable even if it wasnt limited and didnt they used to be called special editions? but its also the only way to get the entire game physically. Theres really no excuse for that and I think Nintendo massively underestimated how many people want to get all their games physically andor are against DLC but would be willing to pay the extra for a bigger full game.,nintendo,d3muvic,2,t5_2qhnk

Having it voiced in a fictional language  la Ico or Panzer Dragoon could be a good compromise. Twilight Princess had a bit of that but it sounded too synthesized.,nintendo,d3oxzoy,4,t5_2qhnk

7766590,0,t1_d3oyzcf,Well many Twilight Princess fans would agree with you.

7781823,0,t3_4lv7ii,Im a huge Fire Emblem fan and I loved Conquest more so than all the other games Ive played from the series FE  as the overall level designs were some of my favorite in the series. Other features such as My Castle online multiplayer adjustments to Pair Up etc. were all welcome additions to the game.Birthright and Revelation were weaker entries in comparison since the level designs and objectives Rout the enemy werent as unique. The story wasnt as powerful as say FE but then again I have never been truly impressed by the story of any Fire Emblem game Ive played so far. Regardless all three routes were still enjoyable.My main complaints about Fates overall Some characters died for the sake of dying which failed to evoke any emotional response from me as a player. Scarlet Flora and Lilith are the ones that immediately come to mind.spoiler From a story perspective I thought that how the children characters were introduced was outright idiotic. Lets make love have a baby and leave them in this unknown otherworldly realm that accelerates their growth? Dont get me wrong the children units are a blast to play with but I hope that if they are introduced in future Fire Emblem games either use a somewhat grounded timetravel mechanic like in Awakening or better yet just do what FE did and have a timeskip. spoiler Minor complaints involve limited support options for characters like Scarlet Shura and Yukimura a somewhat weaker plotmain protagonist and a slightly weaker cast of characters Which could be a result of having too many characters.spoiler,nintendo,d3qq8nc,1,t5_2qhnk

Im pretty sure even their most diehard of fans arent willing to wait over a decade. This doesnt even go into how fans feel about Federation Force. The thing is there already is a black hole with these franchises as a singularity.

7929249,0,t1_d47bbr7,Yeah and? There are probably Green Bay Packers fans that are also Carolina Panthers fans. Does that mean that the two teams will never have games at the same time? Of course not.Nintendo is primarily a consolegames manufacturer whereas Apple is primarily a phone and media player manufacturer. The Packers and the Panthers are both football teams.

Problems with the motion controls mostly with stabbing making the Ghirahim needing calibration and them not responding as fast as needed. Repeated bosses  Fi hand holding you the Sandship puzzle of changing the whole boat is spoiled by Fi it was a great moment and would be amazing to figure out on your own but nope Fi talking about your battery and hearts dying Slow Text speed Bow controls are worse than in tp The Tadtones Eldin Volcano The Thunder Dragon quest and Zelda in the crystal operate on two different version of time travel. OoT had the same problem but those time travel problems were minor sidequests song of storms and beans not big plot points.  Dowsing Little to no side questing isles are boring and Skyloft is OK but not amazing.I do pretty much love everything else great characters music visuals some impressive moments Silent Realms better bosses overall than the borefests of TP The desert area in general is pretty good the last dungeon has a great concept and I do think its better than TP because I think thats a lesser version of OoT that was afraid of experimenting too much unlike this game. I would like an HD version without motion controls faster text speed and less Fi interruptions would make the game way better easier to fix problems than Twilight Princess. I think TPs problems would need the game to be remade from scratch,nintendo,d4dtcff,1,t5_2qhnk

If so then how it works is that you draw the symbol with the right stick circle for hand line for sword etc. and press a.  Youll now have a big weapon above your leaders head that you can swing around with a.If you meant something else then youll probably find it in one of the guides.Useful to remember as the beginners guide image says the whole first run could be considered a practice run.

The Wii also has a special place in my memory cause I got it the first holiday season it was out and was just so surprised that I even had one seeing how fast they were selling that season.  My brother and I put endless hours into it playing Zelda Mario Mario Kart Wii and Smash.  We had other games as well that we enjoyed.  Overall Id say I enjoyed my Wii experience.

8159453,0,t1_d4x60qw,I dont get comments like this. I mean all you have to do is think about it just for one second. The game is  months off of being complete which is a long time in game development so its clear that the build Nintendo were using was prealpha. Of course the FPS will be smoother upon release the game still a has an entire optimisation phase to go through.I heard the same comments about Halo Wars  as well. Baffling that people dont take the time to stop and think about such a simple concept.Its also a reasons I dislike Digital Foundry. They put so much emphasis and the FPS even when testing a game that is nearly an entire year out of being released but dont emphasise the fact that it will most likely improve leaps and bounds over that time so all people are left with is the impression and misinformation that it will be the same upon release which is strictly untrue.,nintendo,d4xhab6,1,t5_2qhnk

Note that this doesnt remotely mean the translatortweeter lied  but its clearly a minefield. In the unofficial qampa translation there are details  like Miyamoto saying how many people worked on Zelda  that Im sure they didnt make up but that are not included. All we can say for sure is that this translation is what Nintendo wanted to put online and  must assume that it accurately reflects a summarised version of what was said.For what its worth I think its likely that Zelda is the only  title but that remark was excluded from the final report.

8208087,0,t1_d53ekxy,You mean the part where I said save for a few? Nah hers was pretty lame actually. I love Mario and my sisters are mean basically. She was the shy NPC stereotype and it got pretty boring after a while.I was talking more Bobbery with him and his dead wife the solitude addiction the acceptance of his circumstances along with a final cherry on the top with the letter from his true love. It went beyond his arc and had a really sweet ending to it. More stuff like that needs to be in the game. And to a much lesser extent TecXX. It was a nice discovery story of a robot who has never felt anything. Played out throughout the whole game and while it felt shallow because we only got so little of it it was definitely something Id like to see again albeit with a little more meat next time.Id like to mention these are not some novel level stories youll find in some RPGs its just a nice lovable set of characters who had good stories but not enough of them. Having a character go through an arc meant that they were storywise essentially dead weight for the rest of the game. They were reduced to a talking puzzlebattle mechanic and not much else. I thought it was cool how each character had different dialogue for the exact same situation but I definitely wanted the characters to have more impact on the story on a game wide scale not just their respective arcs. And Im not asking for anything big here just give these characters enough story to compensate for their screen time.Like look at it this way. Guys like Koops Goombella My Balls yoshi and Madame Flurrie lt this bitch especially they became pretty much planks of wood after their arc was done. What development did Yoshi get after the fight? Koops only got a bit of bravery development and it wasnt much better than Vivians shyness development and Goombella got very little interaction let alone development outside of her relationship with Prof. Frankly. And Madame Flurrie? Lol I dont think she even BELONGS in the game her respective story arc barely featured her at all  she had little to NO relationship to the Punies. Add to that that she just seemed to be so visually and story wise out of place for the arc she was assigned that it just felt weird almost counterintuitive compared to the rest of the cast. She was the worst one story wise by far. At least Goombella had her relationship with Professor Frankly to make her at least somewhat relevant to what is going on. Flurrie was demoted down to puzzle mechanic before her arc was even half way over and she never really left that position. ,nintendo,d53kdfv,3,t5_2qhnk

The backuparchival copy exception is a very narrow limitation relating to a copy being made by the rightful owner of an authentic game to ensure he or she has one in the event of damage or destruction of the authentic. Therefore whether you have an authentic game or not or whether you have possession of a Nintendo ROM for a limited amount of time i.e.  hours it is illegal to download and play a Nintendo ROM from the Internet. And also youre the one criticizing people who are interested in this product so you should seriously drop the dickish attitude. Regarding the case the responsibility falls on you to make your argument not for me to run around and find the sources on your statements. But I will anyway.Oh look.  dollars. That on top of the  dollars it costs to buy a Raspberry Pi and the  dollars it costs to buy a decentquality NES USB controller assuming that you are reusing an SD card rather than buying a new one youre looking at  dollars. And thats not even counting shipping costs the setup time and effort etc. AND at the end of all of that youre not using a Nintendosupported product so if it isnt working right tough luck go on the forums and figure it out. Or I can spend  dollars get  games After all theres only about  NES games I like that arent on the Micro NES  and a controller that all work very well and go about my merry way.gt Either way it doesnt specifically have to be a NES theme caseThats half the reason the Micro NES exists. Otherwise I would just play the games on my computer. ,nintendo,d5d7mnw,2,t5_2qhnk

8317422,0,t3_4th0ez,Im not sure how to address your stiff about buying the console since Im not Canadian but  bucks sounds like a pretty good deal to me.Since you want accessibility in your Pokemon game your best bet is either Pokemon XY or Omega RubyAlpha Sapphire since both are the Pokemon games on ds. If you played Ruby Sapphire or Emerald as a kid youll probably want ORAS since those games are remakes of that generation. Otherwise XY is a pretty solid if easy Pokemon games.The most recent Mario Kart game is Mario Kart  but its Wii U only however Mario Kart  the Mario Kart that came just before it is on the ds. I havent played it but from what Ive heard its mediocre. The monster hunter series is your best bet. Theres also Final Fantasy Explorers which from what Ive heard is like Monster hunter but more simple. I havent played either though.Theres also Xenoblade Chronicles which is exclusive to the new ds but is really really good. If you have a new ds this is the game that will validate your purchase.Since you mentioned you like Ocarina of Time you should also probably know that the ds has a remake of that game as well as a remake of Majoras Mask.,nintendo,d5h8fsm,2,t5_2qhnk

This wasnt posted in their website but it was tweeted by several people there after Iwata mentioned it.As far as Nintendo not wanting to repeat the Wii U with the NXNext about how we are looking at cost we are not thinking of launching the hardware at a loss. When Wii U was launched the yen was very strong. I am assuming that situation will not repeat itself. Selling at a loss at launch would not support the business so we are keeping that mind in developing NX.Thats a direct quote from their Financial Report Q amp A this year.

8345848,0,t3_4tvrj3,POKMONS REPUTATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT IT IS ABOUT TRYING TO CATCH EM ALL! WHICH IS IN ALL FAIRNESS AN UNDERSTANDABLE ASSUMPTION. THATS THE TAGLINE AFTER ALL. BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT IS A SIDEQUEST IN GAMES FEATURING EXTENSIVE SINGLEPLAYER CAMPAIGNS DEEP COMPETITIVE MULTIPLAYER AND AT ITS BEST TONS OF CONTENT. CATCHING EM ALL IS SIMPLY SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE MIDDLE OF OBTAINING GYM BADGES SAVING THE WORLD OR MAKING THE PERFECT TEAM FOR COMPETITIVE BATTLING. EVEN THOSE WHO ARENT INTERESTED IN  COMPLETION CAN STILL SINK HUNDREDS OF HOURS INTO THEM.POKMON GO HOWEVER IS UNDER THE IDEA THAT THE SOLE GOAL OF POKMON IS FILLING OUT THE POKDEX. ANY OTHER SORT OF GAMEPLAY IS A MERE AFTERTHOUGHT. EVEN CATCHING POKMON LACKS THE DEPTH IT DOES IN THE MAIN SERIES. MUCH OF THE FUN OF CATCHING POKMON COMES FROM THE TENSION INVOLVING WHITTLING DOWN THE HEALTH OF THE POKMON TRYING NOT TO KILL IT. THROWING A POKBALL OR AN ULTRA BALL AND HAVING IT FINALLY CLICK IS INCREDIBLY REWARDING AFTER THAT TENSION. POKMON GO DOESNT HAVE THAT. ALL THAT CAN BE DONE IS THROWING POKBALLS UNTIL ONE OF THEM CLICKS AND THE ONLY TENSION COMES FROM HOPING THE GAME WONT CRASH OR OTHERWISE FUCK UP.A COMMON ARGUMENT FOR POKMON GO IS THAT IT DOESNT REALLY MATTER IF THE ACTUAL GAME IS ANY GOOD OR NOT. IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GO OUTSIDE AND SOCIALIZE AND THUS THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL GAME IS BAD DOESNT MATTER RIGHT? WHILE ITS GREAT THAT THE GAME IS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO GO OUTSIDE I SURE AS HELL NEED THAT THAT ENCOURAGEMENT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY SHORTLIVED IN THE GAMES CURRENT STATE. ITEMS EXIST SOLELY FOR CATCHING POKMON AND POKMON DONT DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FIGHT IN GYM BATTLES THAT USE A TERRIBLE COMBAT SYSTEM. WHY BOTHER GOING OUTSIDE FOR ITEMS THAT DONT TIE INTO ANY FUN OR ENGAGING MECHANICS? HOWEVER IN  GAME FREAK ACTUALLY MADE A POKMON GAME THAT ENCOURAGED PLAYERS TO GO OUTSIDE AND EXERCISE TYING IT TO ACTUALLY ENGAGING MECHANICS. IT WAS CALLED HEARTGOLDSOULSILVER AND CAME THE POKWALKER.THE POKWALKER WAS A TAMAGOTCHILIKE DEVICE THAT ACTED AS A PEDOMETER. A SINGLE POKMON COULD BE SENT TO IT AND WALKING AROUND WOULD EARN THE PLAYER WATTS WHICH COULD BE SPENT TO GET VARIOUS ITEMS GET POKMON TO BE USED IN THE GAME AND LEVEL UP THE POKMON THAT IS INSIDE IT. EVEN THOUGH THE POKWALKER DOESNT ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT MUCH BENEFIT IT WAS STILL ON THE RIGHT TRACK. WHAT LITTLE IT DOES PROVIDE TIES INTO A GAME THAT HAS AN EXTREMELY DEEP BATTLE SYSTEM AND A LENGTHY CAMPAIGN.ITS OBVIOUSLY UNREALISTIC FOR GO TO BE AS DEEP OR EXTENSIVE AS A MAINLINE GAME BUT IT DOES SUGGEST THAT NIANTIC IS APPROACHING THE FRANCHISE FROM THE WRONG ANGLE. NIANTIC HAS MADE A SIMPLISTIC GAME ABOUT CATCHING POKMON IN THE REAL WORLD. INSTEAD THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE A SIMPLER POKMON GAME WHERE EXPLORING THE REAL WORLD WAS THE MAIN WAY TO MAKE PROGRESS. THERES POTENTIAL FOR AN ONLINE FP MOBILE BATTLING GAME WHERE OTHER PLAYERS CAN BE FOUGHT IN A LESS COMPLEX VERSION OF THE NORMAL POKMON BATTLING SYSTEM. ITS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE A VERSION OF POKMON THATS STILL FUN IN BITESIZED CHUNKS AFTER TRIMMING THE MORE DETAILED MECHANICS AND STATBUILDING.INSTEAD OF THAT WHAT NIANTIC HAS MADE IS A BAREBONES SHALLOW INGRESS RESKIN THAT HAS VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF MECHANICS OR ENJOYABLE PROGRESSION. WHILE POKMON GO HAS BEEN A MASSIVE SUCCESS THE INHERENTLY POINTLESS NATURE OF IT MAKES ME SKEPTICAL OF ITS LONGTERM POTENTIAL. NIANTIC DOUBLED DOWN ON CATCHING POKMON WHILE IGNORING THE OTHER COMPONENTS THAT WORK TO MAKE POKMON THE MONOLITH IT IS.YES I WROTE THIS ELSEWHERE AS WELLEDIT BLAST BALL IS FUCKING SHIT,nintendo,d5ks8w7,17,t5_2qhnk

Thats it. Not some gimmicky shit just good games.Yes Nintendo is behind the times but acting as though they havent just always made good games is silly. DO they try to shake up the hardware to move the medium forward? Hell yeah. May not always work but god damnit I admire their determination not to fall into a rut. Because eventually tflops arent going to matter anymore. And virtual reality might be on the horizon but its still young tech.gtAdditionally while Nintendo fans talk about how theres nothing new on current gen consoles are ingnoring the fact that some people actually like these games and cant play inFamous God of War Uncharted Bloodborne Until Dawn The Last of Us and upcoming Last Guardian Horizon Zero Dawn new God of War and thats just first party. Nintendo has some great titles but not everyone wants to keep playing Mario and Zelda either.I have no problem with that. I own a PS. Its looking forward to TLG Horizon Dawn and Im sure there will be a ton of new games throughout the PSs life cycle that I will love that I cant play on Nintendo systems. But the same is true the other way around as well. There are tons of amazing Nintendo titles I cant play anywhere else and those Nintendo games often offer me something besides just shiny new graphics.Also its just kind of bullshit to boil Nintendos roster down to Zelda and Mario.

Also that Nintendo has said theyre being very protective and secretive because theyre afraid of others copying their idea. but what new idea is here? and Dave talks about a Tegra Tablet with detachable controllers from two years ago thats basically this same thing. So whats to be so secretive about? Also Nintendo has said this will be a complete departure from the WiiU but this doesnt look like that. He has me convinced this is bogus.

8447512,0,t1_d5wrodq,Mario and Sonic are going for the gold in the Rio  Olympic Games and after spending  hours on the game and all of what it has to offer Im glad to say that both teams hit the mark with only a few dents along the way. Despite what word of mouth and poor sales might lead you to believe this is one of the Wii Us best offerings and a great swan song for the console.The positive impressions start right off the bat with a gorgeous inengine opening move and a cracking main tune. A few minutes afterwards your Mii is dropped into the richly detailed sunsoaked waters of Copacabana Beach where Mario and Sonic characters welcome you to Rio and suggest you take on Single Matches. From the getgo this is the only mode available and the game does a good job of easing you into its  different events which you can choose to play on any difficulty you like. If you fail you can switch characters of retry the event almost instantaneously. Mario and Sonic series veterans would want to stick to the Extra Hard Mode as that provides an ample challenge not seen in the previous games.Mario and Sonic Finally Go for the Gold!Most of the games events play beautifully. Rugby Sevens was an absolute blast with scrums tackles and drop goals all present and accounted for. Theres even a neat looking Tackle Evasion Mechanic which makes your character do awesome looking backflips for a speed boost. Table Tennis is more nuanced than ever with the lack of motion controls allowing the developers to give you full control over your movement and adding  different shot speeds.Beach Volleyball might feel awkward and slow at first but advanced techniques such as blocking the quick and dump shots and the satisfying power shots really give this mode great longevity. Football has undergone a massive revamp over the London  game the physics feel much tighter the ball has a real weight to it yet it still has that fun arcadey feel.Gymnastics Javelin Throw Triple Jump etc. all have that addictive high score chasing feel that really helps with the Olympic theme of gunning for the world record. The DDR like button timing of the Gymnastics event is really tense at the Expert difficulties and I squealed in glee when I finally hit the top  in the Equestrian Event as Daisy. BMX is yet another highlight often I had close matches with the MAX AI even when I performed massive jumps and rail grinds. m is a frantic button mashing super dashing race to the finish and the slower characters can make up for their plodding pace with their excellent power ups.Now I enjoyed the rival matches in previous games but now they are better than ever thanks to actually being able to play with them in specific events. Fans will be glad to see Rosalina in her skimpy leotard performing gymnastics or Sticks from the Sonic Boom universe hitting the bullseye in Archery. The main characters such as Luigi PeachDaisy and Tails make an appearance in all events and even have their very own Miiverse stamps which is a massive improvement from the DS versions restrictions.The only real duffer in the package is the xm Relay which bores with its linear gameplay and complicated button scheme. If you pick  power characters youve basically won as their Super Dashes are the best of the bunch. The lack of real nuance and skill required in comparison to the other events is a letdown.Its Time to Duel!Fans of the series might be disappointed to know that the Dream Events have been scrapped but the Duel Events more than make up for their absence. The variations of Football Beach Volleyball and Rugby Sevens incorporate wacky powerups into the mix and attacking opponents cause you to build up your points banking them by scoring.Duel Football plays like the true successor to Super Mario Strikers. Here fouls and throw ins are scrapped with the versatile Plasma Mechanic and ranged attacks allowing you to mix up your offence and defence. Duel Rugby Sevens can get hilarious as Super Attacks are introduced into the mix. Chain attacking your enemies almost feels like a souped up D version of PacMan and I love it. Beach Volleyballs items can be devastating and rallies become more tense than ever as you rack up the duel points. Games where I scored so many points only for it to be destroyed by the COM tallying up a massive amount of Duel Points.Get enough medals in the Single Match Mode and you can unlock the Heroes Showdown mode which is by far the best way to play the game. You either side with Team Mario or Team Sonic choose to play  or  rounds and play through the games various events to buff your characters and eliminate the opposition. You can decide to take risks and revive team members with your captain but lose them and its game over. Special cards also come into play which can fire up your teammates or even force your opponent to pick a weak character. Its not quite chess but its a much better party game than any of the recent Mario Parties or Smash Tour.Music and SoundThe graphics of the game are among the best of what the console has to offer hands down. Dynamic Lighting SelfShadowing and Global Illumination all feature and the events run at a slick FPS in nonsplitscreen only dipping at intense moments in some of the Duel Events.The character models are much more richly detailed than that of Mario Kart  with smooth picturesque animations and defined details that really pop out in replays. Beach Volleyball blew me away with its sand deformation and lovely lighting and half my time with the game was spent capturing every angle of Daisy performing gymnastics as a result. Theres no antialiasing and the texture filtering is horrible but we can chalk that up to the hardware not being up to snuff.The music is also topnotch there are over  pieces of music from the Mario and Sonic universes to listen to and they can be played in the background through all events. The original soundtrack is the best of the series thus far. SEGA Sound Team have really knocked it out of the park with the main theme. Seriously even the menu select and Ghost Match menu are fully orchestrated! There are  new remixes from past Mario and Sonic games including Rosalinas Comet Observatory and DKs Jungle Swing.MultiplayerThe series is known for its multiplayer but how does this game stack up in that area over past games?One massive improvement is the removal of turn taking. Now the Triple Jump and Javelin Throw dont have the massive periods of downtime the originals had. Boxing and Table Tennis can be played in a tournament like fashion and the team events such as Rugby Sevens can be played in coop. Unfortunately every single event played in splitscreen with the exception of Table Tennis is capped at FPS and you cannot assign  or more players to the same team in Football or Rugby which can be a huge disappointment to families.Conclusion or TLDROverall I feel that SEGA has really struck solid gold with this entry. Ditching motion controls was a right move allowing the team to flesh out the events to the best they have ever been. Graphics are among the best the console has to offer and the original soundtrack is the best of the series. The dream events have been replaced and the guest characters are limited to one event each but if you spend enough time with it youll see the amount of care and love SEGA lavished onto this instalment. Without the amount of sports you get for  its basically a steal.,nintendo,d5xh5l3,3,t5_2qhnk

Reggie basically says that they didnt do enough to distinguish it from the Wii and that sentence backs that up. If they want to raise awareness and hype about their new system compared to the Wii U they need to start talking about it and when they talk about it they need to focus on what makes it improved over the Wii U. Heres the thing the internet was trying to tell Nintendo after the Wii U launch that consumers were confused about what it was. The box art focused on the tablet and the console looked too similar to the Wii. People thought it was just a  controller.

8512918,0,t1_d65nxgo,I didnt actually find Xs ground combat to be better either. It was flashier and a bit more actiony but gameplaywise I felt it was slightly worse. Chain Attacks Warnings Talent Arts and Visions really broke up the monotony of the combat in XBC. In X those are all removed. All talent arts are replaced with Overdrive which is basically just a Haste buff with a multiplier and the Soul Voice system since it was tied to your group healing basically became a game of can I wait for a callout before I use an ability? If so just wait. I found myself not doing much outside of waiting for colorcoordinated cues and pressing the corresponding button. It felt more like Simon than actual combat to me.The fact that the base combat is boring is because it is in the first one too though. Without the monado and party gauge the first games combat would be pretty awful.,nintendo,d65o7z3,1,t5_2qhnk

8519337,1,t1_d66h11c,just to play devils advocate the wii was awesomely underpowered featured extremely divisive control schemes suffered from a horrible amount of shovelware and the initial motion controls were so spotty that they needed to release a peripheral to circumvent that. dont get me wrong i was incredibly excited for the Wii i got mine in January  and initially i played it a lot. but Nintendo failed to release any really engaging games and after awhile i grew so tired of the controls. the only games that ever really stuck out to me were Wii Sports both Mario Galaxy games brilliant games btw Twilight Princess overrated and Skyward Sword underrated. and at this point the only one i ever go back to is Wii Sports. going back to a much more standard control scheme with the Wii U drew me in much more and while the screen was a really shit judgement on their part costs underutilization standard definition resolution horrific battery life etc the gameplay i found to much more engaging since i didnt have to focus on arm movements as much so i could be more into the game. another huge improvement was that you no longer had to point at the screen to make menu selections anymore like many games required. tedious things like that really are what killed the wii for me in the end. case in point DKCR. thats a game that absolutely needed  motion controls and they still tacked some on and with Tropical Freeze that is completely remedied.,nintendo,d66h7ng,2,t5_2qhnk

Every new way to interact with Luigi would take only like  seconds of messing around with the touch screen to figure out on your own but instead youd get boxes and boxes of companion character dialogue to the point where I eventually just had to put the game down because it was too frustrating.

8662729,0,t1_d6ofadq,I feel that its different in Corruption because . Its not a spinoff . Retro Studios were working on other projects at the time and afterwards . There was really no talk or mention of Prime  after Prime . . Tanabe expressed that he wanted to do a game with Sylux and Samus. . The teaser was put in place in incase future Metroid Prime games were made so fans wouldnt complain about Prime  being the last and only prime game.And again why would they make a spinoff if they have no interest in the Metroid series? If Nintendo had  interest in Metroid they would easily just ignore the franchise and refuse to make any future games like say FZero or Mother. There is really no payoff to make Federation Force because at worst fans would as they currently do consider it an abomination and refuse to buy any more Metroid games at best it drums up little bit of interest in the Metroid series. They made this game so people would have something to play while they are currently working on Prime .,nintendo,d6ogj3z,-2,t5_2qhnk

I know a few guys that work at GameStop that genuinely care about the games and products but all it takes is one lazy employee who accepts deeply scratched dirty or otherwise unacceptable games to fuck everything up. GameStop has some decent prices on used games and cool stuff like PowerUp points which are a nice addition but they are barely any more cost efficient than buying online and the quality is absolutely atrocious especially for consoles. Games are one thing but the consoles they accept are often dirty heavily scratched or have other issues which arent immediately apparent to the sales person. GameStop sucks.

If you listen to Tanabe in interviews it seems all his ideas are geared toward the D Prime series. Its hard to sell a D game for home console prices in todays market.  D games are expected to either suit handhelds better or sell for Indie prices.  It doesnt help expectations that Metroids last two D games were in fact handheld titles.  This of course means any new game would have to sell more to make up production costs since handheld titles only sell for rds the price of their console counterparts.  This issue may start to become a mute point depending on how Nintendo merges their handheld and console markets with the NX. Playing off the last point Nintendo may be concerned continuing the series as a handheld D franchise would be seen as a step back by the fans and the games not considered part of the main series.  D games actually outnumber D at this point and in all this pushback against FF little of it has been used to communicate a desire for more D entries.  Like I said before Prime  seems to be the most vocal request.gtit might not be a franchise as near and dear to the Big Ns heart as it is to ours.Theres probably a good bit of truth to this.  Metroid has never really been that big in Japan.  Even in the US its sales have sadly never matched its high renown.,nintendo,d7b41bz,5,t5_2qhnk

They may have some data or be misguided into thinking they can skate by with toads. Because Toads are classic characters!

A special toolbox area for the tools would also address the same problem probably. Mostly Id like to have the old closet system back. Being able to have different closets hold different items like the original GC game did would be great while still having one major closet for the museum area and one in the house.Another thing Id like is like a mini game style activity where you can actually play your instruments rather than random notes.Lastly new villagers having to go through the mayor and town hall before deciding where their house will be. Even if we cant choose exactly maybe just giving us  in  options for where their house can go or something. Those are my ideas and the ones I liked ,nintendo,d7knecy,15,t5_2qhnk

8981562,1,t3_53ai35,Im aware Im on the Nintendo subreddit but the Wii U will be remembered as a flop. The Dreamcast has a better library. I also dont like the comparisons because the Dreamcast was generally wellliked SEGA just went under. Also the GameCube has a significantly better library than the Wii U its really not even close. This has by far been my least favorite era for Nintendo. I genuinely believe the DS has a significantly better library than the Wii U. I have thouroughly enjoyed my DS from the beginning of its lifespan until now and its still got games coming out for it. Really I dont like when people try to defend the Wii U. Nintendo havent released a more disappointing system since the Virtual Boy. Its so obviously ass. The controller feels like a tablet made by fisherprice with an inexcusable resolution and the slowest stream of releases in Nintendoa history with the lowest average critic reception and the lowest sales. An allaround embarrassment. Mario Kart  was fun but I honestly had more fun with  and I felt it has a better feel. D World was fun despite the haters but again the DS just released D Land stealing the thunder. Zelda is going to be better on NX Animal Crossing skipped it Metroid skipped it FZero skipped it Ultra Smash and Amiibo Festival were abominations... Pikmin  was just about the only allaround masterful game released for the system. Id say that Splatoon was also the best game overall for it funwise. Smash sold way better on you guessed it DS and tbh is still inferior to Melee. It should be an embarrassment how much more fun Project M was. Mario Maker has a cult following but myself and my fellow Mario fan friends didnt care for it. It lacked what we appreciated most about D Mario games and we still play them pretty regularly so it lost its appeal. I seriously think people will look back on this as the worst era for Nintendo. The NX will hopefully deliver after the flub that has been the past four years.,nintendo,d7rg2yv,7,t5_2qhnk

9128723,0,t1_d88dbd1,Thats literally not possible.  HD TVs simply dont handle the p signal from the NES correctly.  They interpret the signal as i and attempt to deinterlace.  This means you necessarily get a hz image with deinterlacing artifacts when things are in motion and on certain TVs a lot of lag.  Its unavoidable.Theoretically its possible that an HD TV could be designed to handle a p signal correctly but no HD TV has been documented doing so.  And believe me there are people really really dedicated to this stuff.  If any HD TV handled p correctly they would know about it.  As it stands only expensive upscalers like the Framemeister can properly convert p sources for display on HD TVs.  Or you can go the CRT route as most CRTs handle p perfectly and with no lag.  This is what I do.I have hooked up my SNES to my HD TV before as an experiment.  There was very little lag meaning my TV in game mode is very fast at deinterlacing which is good.  Not all TVs are like that.  The image looked alright.  If I didnt know better I mightve said it looked crisp but in reality it was fraught with various artifacts in addition to just a generally degraded looking hz image.,nintendo,d894qod,1,t5_2qhnk

The real question is how do you plan to make it and can you make it happen. Ive tried a couple of ideas Ive been able to refine it to a point where I know my tools. My resources go as far as simple d games. The hard part is making the game itself which can take years and no guarantees.Better be worth something if you plan on selling a game on just an idea.

9221226,0,t1_d8kn5sg,They knew what they were doing. They had a limited time and budget and decided to put in features they knew the majority of people would play. That comment they made about young people not enjoying the battle frontier was only half of the truth. If they were being totally honest they would have said we didnt include the battle frontier because we ran the numbers and realized that it wasnt worth the effort.These games are designed by product managers well before the first line of code is written. This particular decision likely goes back to  when the games were first being designed. The game included all of the content from the originals except for the BF so I cant really call them devoid of content in good conscience. They certainly offered more things to do than Emerald just not the one thing people really wanted. I also find it ironic that X and Y despite having way less content than ORAS seem to have way more apologists defending them because the new generations are always empty on content like thats a valid excuse. At least ORAS felt like complete games even if they werent what people wanted.While Im cetainly annoyed the BF was left out its not like they ever promised it to be in there. The fact that they avoided talking about it literally until weeks after the game shipped should have been a major red flag. People need to learn to stop designing these games in their heads before they actually play them. It only ends in disappointment. I feel like Im the only person who can say these games were good despite them not being what I was expecting.,nintendo,d8kuwih,8,t5_2qhnk

Not a bad game had good ideas but I much prefer Pandoras Tower.Pandoras Tower played more like a Zelda game which I liked pretty much a big long Zelda dungeon with bosses that kind of reminded me of Shadow of the Colossus. I really need to replay it.,nintendo,d8pzkyk,6,t5_2qhnk

9265099,0,t3_55m5od,D World was considered linear in a negative way? It felt like a Mario game to me. It had replay value there was a purpose to go back and figure out how to get the stars which can used to argue that its not linear. You can go straight to the goal or use a different way to get the stars then get to the goal.To argue about Shovel Knight I wouldnt consider it linear. You have the ability to attack the bosses in an order of your choosing. Some stages have different ways to get to the end and you can grind and get upgrades on optional stages. Anyway Mario to me has always been linear get from point A to point B but thats not a bad thing. What matters then to me is how well the level is designed. Do I need to try? Or can I just get an item to let me fly over the stage ...at this point to my thought process of linear its showing Mario to not be linear at all since you have many different ways to get from point A to point B. ,nintendo,d8qf12f,1,t5_2qhnk

In the fake you can see that generic resistors are used a generic motherboard is used nothing on the motherboard says anything about nintendo and its all... Suspicious... Third party memory cards for the gamecube have existed since the systems launch and usually work fine. Nintendo is a company that has procedures that are followed immaculately whenever anything is distributed and the same can be seen with gameboy cartridges. Furthermore  the original memory cards were manufactured in Japan whereas these appear to be a China mass production. ,nintendo,d90ekhb,1,t5_2qhnk

9344618,0,t3_58gz2k,Something I didnt mention in my comments when this was posted around  cause I only thought about it during class.Nintendo has always been about making affordable hardware  they want people to be able to buy their product without breaking the bank and thats why they use older tech usually. However now that this is confirmed to be a hybrid console that really changes some things. There is the potential that they beefed up the hardware to be more or less on par with the current console generation. Consider thisA  GB Wii U is    A New DS is Barring any promo deals etc youd likely be paying around  for both a handheld and a consoleHowever now that the hardware is all one system that really changes things. Without the need to buy a specific handheld to play a lot of games you can lop off a good . Considering this might nintendo  up their price point a little bit considering this serves as two consoles effectively? Say  for the Switch with pretty uptodate hardware since consumes will no longer have to decide whether they want to afford the console or the handheld.EDIT Realized I said considering a lot and saw some typos.

Gamecube didnt really impress me but I did love it anyway. Wii I was excited for but ultimately felt too gimmicky and lost my interest early in the consoles life. When Wii U rolled around I had almost no interest but got one anyway. Wii U actually wasnt too bad but the offtv play made me wish I could take the games with me on the go. And with Switch now I can! The thing is ever since I started college in  Ive always taken my GBADSDS with me to school and work to play during breaks lunches and gaps between classes and jobs. So as a result I was away from home more than I was at home and didnt play my regular consoles as much. The fact that I can take the same games on Switch with me to play during lunches and between jobs is what makes me excited.,nintendo,d96zluq,1,t5_2qhnk

9410394,0,t1_d938rv0,I apologize if this is a bit longwinded but I cant help gushing about my research.  The stuff I work on is less about editing genes like CRISPR and more about doing routine maintenance on the genome.  The individual bases in your DNA get involved in all sorts of accidental chemical reactions in the cell that muck with their chemical structure.  It actually happens an estimated  times per day in each of your trillions of cells.  And these modified bases can cause harmful mutations or can even be directly toxic to the cell.  All organisms from bacteria to plants to people have a system for spotting these problems and essentially chopping the messedup base out of the DNA to be replaced with an undamanged one.  This strategy is simple in concept but because there are so many different ways your DNA can get modified your body needs a huge network of different proteins each designed to fix specific problems.  People have been trying to sort out which proteins do what for years now. If you want to know more google base excision repair.  ,nintendo,d98u0mf,2,t5_2qhnk

Snake ones that they couldnt get working on the DS ex. Ice Climbers or ones that they didnt have interest in doing or couldnt see working ex. Ridley unfortunately.I find it weird that we only got one character from the ballot and that so many popular choices like Inkling and K.

9479785,0,t1_d9hjs94,I agree that it might not mean anything at all and that Cloud being in Smsh may have had absolutely nothing to do with it even if we get FFVII remake on the Switch but in retrospect there are more logical reasons why your  examples didnt happen which FFVII remake may also have reasons itself brought to light in the future if it doesnt get a Switch release.Mother  was not a new game anymore when Lucas was added to Brawl being roughly  years old after Brawl was released and with the DS already being out for some time it may not have been profitable enough for them to translate that game though hilariously enough its looking slightly more likely to happen now with Mother  being translated and released on the VC and with it being only available digitally which saves them the hasslescosts of physical production and retail.MGS amp  not happening on Nintendo consoles was probably due to the Wii and Wii Us hardware though of course Im not in a position to know for a fact if thats the case but we did get MGS for the DS which is what Im basing it on.FFVII remake is still TBA so far only for PS unfortunately though we didnt know about the Switch when that announcement was made but if developing it on the Switch isnt too different which rd party developers commented that it was easier to develop on than the Wii U if the Switch can handle the game and if there isnt some sort of exclusivity agreement with Sony I think its more possible than the former  especially since Square confirmed support for the Switch. That being said again I agree that one shouldnt be optimistic about it and I wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt on the Switch... Id be a bit more surprised if it was on the Switch TBH.,nintendo,d9hl60b,1,t5_2qhnk

9559870,0,t3_5brisb,I was  when the N released. Maybe it has to do with age but I had a few older friends that really hadwanted the PS. Except for one kid they were all slightly older than me. Everyone around my age was on the Nintendo train though. I honestly in my  year old head was super glad they stuck with carts. I wasnt into RPGs so that wasnt a factor for me. My first experience with D modeling like that was a kiosk with Super Mario  instead of PS. Maybe thats what hooked me too. Also I thought it was dumb that PS had discs because I had cds at the time and they scratched and wouldnt play and had to buffer and everyone was selling  second skip protection crap. I was like screw that give me a cart I can throw around take to a friends house etc with no load times. Until that point games didnt have load timesin my mind unless it was a PC game. Also the Z trigger and rumble pak sold it for me. Also the  player option was HUGE lots of nights with friends with Goldeneye Perfect Dark Mario Kart Smash and Mario Party.So my opinion N was superior in quality of titles multiplayer actionparty games load times and if you didnt care about RPGs FMV or some of the sports titles that werent on both.However on PS I loved CTR NFL Blitz which was also N but I played it first on PS at a friends house Spyro and Crash Bandicoot. ,nintendo,d9rg7xd,2,t5_2qhnk

9571870,0,t3_5br05o,The switch has one very specific niche  home console level gaming on the the go.Now this will only work if it gets proper rd party support. You are making the assumption that the Switch isnt powerful enough for this but we just do not know that yet.Even with PS Pro and Scorpio Xbox One and PS wont be abandoned anytime soon. These are both clearly marketed at midgeneration upgrades and there is no expectations that these will completely replace PSXbox.That means that in order for the Switch to be able to fill its niche it only have to be powerful enough to run the games that PSXbox runs and it doesnt even have to look quite as good just good enough.If they can manage that and get enough units out they can hit both the targets groups they need. Nintendo Fans that liked the Wii U and love nintendo games but wish that there was better rd party support. Non nintendo gamers that want to play the same games they play on other consolesPC but on the go.This comes down almost completely to rd party support. If they get good rd party they can hit several target groups that Microsoft and Sony can not reach. If they dont they once again will only manage to catch the real Nintendo fans  ie the same fairly small amount of people that bought the Wii U.,nintendo,d9sxfb0,1,t5_2qhnk

9613880,0,t3_5cn7nv,game can be emulated in open source emulators so nintendo could do what a few other companies could do and just license out the code from those already. what they should have done with the NES mini to fix its small emulation errors,nintendo,d9y3wlz,0,t5_2qhnk
9614713,0,t3_5cn7nv,I have no idea where the Nintendo doesnt have the rightswhatever keeps coming from. That arguement makes zero sense for multiple reasons  Argonaut created the game and chip while contracted by Nintendo. Under that logic Starfox would be owned by Argonaut as well which we very well know it is not.  Nintendo would not have offered it to be licensed out to third party partners if they did not own the rights to the chip. I could go on and on but as you can see this doesnt make any sense.The more likely reasoning for not making Super FX emulation is that it is purely not worth the incredible amount of time and effort to create accurate and stable emulation for effectively  games Star Fox and Yoshis Island. With the adequate to Nintendo at least GBA port of YI that leaves Star Fox in which I am sure Nintendo would not want to put out there extremely early D graphics on their platforms. I am sure they would rather commit those resources into remaking that game instead. One has to remember the Star Fox looks and runs rough especially now. ,nintendo,d9y7lzb,5,t5_2qhnk

D Land and World certainly werent bad games but they always felt bythenumbers to me and didnt do a whole lot that genuinely felt out there. With Galaxy on the other hand how more out there can you get than outer space? Everything about Galaxy stands the test of time. Its graphics its level design its music really... just about all of it. The only thing that genuinely bothers me about the game are some of the borderline unfair missions looking at you prankster comets and trying to collect star bits while progressing through a stage.    I wont go into too much detail regarding Galaxy . Its a fine game but it really doesnt feel like a sequel so much as an expansion. But I think most people agree with that so what else can you say? Besides its very difficult to top something as grandiose and amazing as the first SMG so Im surprised Nintendo even attempted to at all with a direct sequel.

9699357,0,t3_5dkq47,Ill do the ones that Ive played.Bowsers Inside Story Battles are fun theres a memorable soundtrack and overall one of my favorite RPGs of all time.Thousand Year Door Memorable characters and creative writing. My only drawback are certain sections that include a lot of backtracking or padding. Bowsers Inside Story has some examples of padding but none as monotonous as saying I love you.  times and nothing as bad as General Whites wild goose chase.Super Mario RPG A lot of variety with gameplay a battle system that set the template for all future Mario RPGs and a plot that featured memorable locales and characters. Im not as familiar with this one as I am the other two so that may explain why its not as high.Super Paper Mario Yes. The gameplay is a huge shift and there are more sections that can be considered annoying padding although looking at my list of examples I just have World  listed in bold and covered in fire. But it has an arguably more engaging story with a villain that you end up sympathizing with even if just a little bit. Throw in the usual clever writing and its still a fairly enjoyable experience.Dream TeamEmbarrassingly Im not too far along in this game Heck I think Ive only had one big Dreamy Luigi battle. Maybe Ill get around to it but I have some other titles on my plate that I want to complete first.All of the other titles that I have not played yet as I do not have the proper experience with them to rank them properly.Sticker Star It is possible that some of the other titles could be less enjoyable for me. However I am not lying when I say that the only part of Sticker Star that I happily look back upon is the title screen theme. Everything else is just a reminder of why I returned that title a long time ago. The sad part was that I wanted to like it. I wanted to ignore its massively flawed battle system and some really annoying levels to see the beauty in it all.

9720081,0,t1_dab3vdy,Its going to get better real soon. The game seems more go there do this than past games to me but it actually feels more like a typical RPG with a ton of bosses instead of gym leaders and with each area being like its own mini dungeon.

9720139,0,t3_5ebzgd,The Nintendo Switch looks like its going to be pretty cool but when out of docked mode its going to have reduced processor speeds and Battery Life is estimated to be only  or  hours at best.

Battery life is pretty good can close the lid open and pick right up where you left off. Video games in society isnt nearly as taboo either so I dont really care about pulling my DS out anywhere and playing for a bit. Great selection of games old and new. For Black Friday there are a ton of place offering the New DS for  could not be more worth it. Also DS games hold their value so well.

9773093,0,t3_5f1l0s,Virtual Console titles have save states so you can pick up exactly where you left off if you use that feature. For most all? VC games opening the system Home menu and closing the software from there will suspend your game so it opens back to exactly where you stopped playing the next time you load it up.Also a lot of Zelda games have a mechanic that lets you warp around dungeons to some extent. In Ocarina of Time the Farores Wind item creates a checkpoint wherever you are that stays there when you save and quit so you can warp back to it the next time you play. Ooccoo in Twilight Princess works the same way. In Wind Waker there are warp pots scattered through the dungeons that you can warp between after youve uncovered them usually by burning the lid off. And probably others Im forgetting.It is frustrating if you cant have an hour or more set aside to finish a dungeon in one go but its one of those series quirks Ive gotten used to and come to like in a way. But to try to answer your question it started in the original Zelda where Id guess technical limitations kept it from remembering exactly where you stopped playing so it just saved either overworld or entrance to dungeon. After that probably just tradition.,nintendo,dahr0d3,2,t5_2qhnk
9773229,0,t1_dahj1c7,Yeah either Nintendo was really inept regarding making accurate projections of how many people wanted to buy one or theyre artificially creating scarcity to boost hype. Either way only scalpers are winning on this one so far and it really bites.  ,nintendo,dahrm2v,3,t5_2qhnk

9787102,0,t3_5f1in3,Both have already been said but I want to throw in my opinions on em.Xenoblade ChroniclesMy alltime favorite game ever.Everything about this game ties together to create the Wiis masterpiece. Its an engaging story set in a unique world of titans where the music creates fantastic ambiance for the awesome characters to interact in. The games atmosphere is great being able to see other areas of the Bionis and the Mechonis as you scale them is a super cool effect. The individual areas themselves are grand and memorable and the great music fits each area quite nicely and ups the sense of adventure. The characters are fantastic  I love each of the seven main characters and their interactions with each other and the supporting cast make them shine brighter.Combat in the game is super fun. Its fairly complex MMOstyle with a heavy reliance on positioning topped off with basic combos status conditions ultimates and the really cool Vision mechanic. I have a lot of fun just getting in to fights in this game particularly against the stronger Unique Monsters scattered throughout the areas.While I will admit the sequel handles quests much better than this game I find that the original does do them well enough to provide even more hours of entertainment throughout the world on top of the incredibly long story. Theres just so much to do in this game.The voice acting is also pretty fantastic.Fire Emblem Radiant DawnThe presentation and level of detail of this games story is quite frankly the pinnacle of the series. Modern Fire Emblem fans often complain about Fatess writing and often lack thereof. As an example many boss fights in Fates only feature special dialogue with Corrin but pretty much every relevant characterboss combo gets dialogue together in Radiant Dawn. Its little things like this which really add a fine polish to the game that means a lot.The game has the interesting idea of being told from multiple perspectives with select units being able to flip between armies and the players armies can fight at times. Its really neat and is a feature I would like to see return in the future personally.Radiant Dawn is one of the harder Fire Emblems requiring players to think on their toes at all times. Even so the game is still very honest with almost every slipup being directly the fault of the player. Its a big step up from the previous American Fire Emblems particularly Sacred Stones and wasnt quite matched in the American games until Conquest. Radiant Dawn is very satisfying to beat but getting to that point can be quite the struggle.This game is a very solid sequel to Path of Radiance and is a standout entry in the series. Its a real shame it sold so poorly and has extremely high prices because of it.,nintendo,dajh1u7,1,t5_2qhnk

The HD Zelda games were made by a very tiny team in the case of WW and an outside developer in the case of TP so they didnt affect internal development resources at all. The enhanced Wii U ports wont either. Meanwhile studios like EAD Tokyo Retro and others havent released anything in several years. Youve surely noticed that there has been quite a software drought on Wii U in ... of course its because they have shifted focus to the Switch.Having their development focused on a single platform with Switch instead of spread across two platforms is sure to mean a more steady stream of first party content on Switch overall. Third party content is of course still unknown. That will all depend on whether or not the platform is a success.,nintendo,daxvqiv,1,t5_2qhnk

9976757,0,t3_5ieua8,Ive said this before and Ill say it again but I really think Star Fox Assault covered a lot of the points youve mentioned and its a much more promising foundation to iterate off of.  I think fans of Star Fox have clung to  so much that its ultimately damaged the series.  Assault did a lot of good things but people focused more on its lack of content and the bad blood caused by Star Fox Adventures.  Assault had a lot of varied gameplay and the vs. multiplayer mode let you play as different characters with their own specific stats and abilities.  Fox was all around Falco had an attack boost in arwings Slippy had an attack boost in Landmasters he invented the landmaster Krystal started with an extra barrier etc.  Also in the story missions your wingmen had much more clearly defined roles.  Granted they were still largely useless but while you were on the ground youd see Falco keeping control of the skies above and Slippy or Krystal supporting you on foot.  This gave a much better sense that you were working together as a team.I think its rather unfortunate that they decided to reset the series to Star Fox  theres a lot of innovation and ideas that was thrown away for the sake of satisfying nostalgia.    The lukewarm reception of Zero is more because a Star Fox  remake simply cant flourish in the modern era.  Remake Assault give it more levels and fine tune the gameplay a little and Im sure it would be a really solid game.,nintendo,db7zzkx,16,t5_2qhnk

10013451,0,t1_dbchof5,I agree with you completely. Theres a lot of fanboying ITT blaming the mobile game crowd but this is a very fair review. I tried it out and I disliked the gameplay  the collectibles are more a frustrating task in memorizing stages than a challenge. If you miss something you have to restart and try all over again. Contrast this with the other NSMB games where theres an element of stage exploration and you can go back and poke around the stage for collectibles. The alwayson DRM is also unpleasant for a single player mobile game. I think its safe to say SMR is YMMV. If you like it awesome! But it doesnt appeal to everyone and longterm Mario fans may have issues with the gameplay. It certainly doesnt deserve the blind fanboying ITT where anyone who doesnt think the gameplay is worth  is entitled. As someone who primarily uses a DS which is technically  mobile games....I didnt buy SMR because the gameplay wasnt worth the pricetag.,nintendo,dbcs534,116,t5_2qhnk

Im watching some videos of Geforce Now and I cant find much about lag and all the games are running at p but I do believe people would have problems. Im wondering if the screen is p what if they made the service p.. would that defeat a lot of the potential lag problems? Or perhaps it could be used exclusively for the virtual console service as you say and maybe indie eshop games. That way the storage on the system can be saved for the bigger games and it wouldnt be a huge problem to stream older games as they arent HD. One problem I had with the Wii Wii U and DS is that I download a HECK of a lot of virtual console games. A cloud based virtual console would be an amazing option.

They were into Joel and Mike and the puppets making fun of the films.They turned film into an interactive medium for their audience.

10277866,0,t3_5n14q7,Mario and Luigi Paper JamThe Mario and Luigi gameplay has always been a mishmash of new ideas yet Paper Jam is the game that formed all these ideas together in the best package for a Mario RPG. Adding Paper Mario in the system is a neat feature with its own learning curve. Mario and Luigi also feel more different to eachother to make you feel like both have more unique advantages and disadvantages. The sidegames also feel great as the Paper Craft battles are also a great diversion to the gameplay and the Toad Rescue missions are more silly minigames with great banter.Speaking of banter the humour in this game is really a step above. Lots of little funny jokes. Id credit this game for giving Bowsers assistant Kamek more of a soul and also does its job of making the Koopalings feel more like actual characters.Its often said that Bowsers Inside Story is the best of the  MampL games but I think Paper Jam has just enough to reign supreme of Marios turnbased RPG series.,nintendo,dc91vut,6,t5_2qhnk

10308020,0,t3_5nljsy,gtIt just seems like a gimmick.I dont find this to be true and I think thats what makes the system so appealing. There really is no gimmick. At least theres no gimmick that has an effect on gameplay. The gimmick with the Wii was motion controls. The gimmick with the Wii U was the Gamepad controller screen. The gimmick with the Switch is... portability? Practicality? Versatility? I guess? Why is that a turn off? Sure the system can do all these tricks to allow it to fit into various lifestyles for people who play video games but as far as game design goes there really is no gimmick. As far as we know the games play just like any standard video game with a controller and some buttons and some joysticks. Thats it. As far as we know this is the first standard gimmick free Nintendo console weve gotten in over  years. Knowing that Nintendo wont have to develop around goofy motion controls or trying to figure out integration with the Gamepad and knowing we can just get back to the core of the way video games are meant to played that means a whole lot in terms of direction they can take their next generation library. That leaves tons of openness and freedom. When you look at it this way this really feels like the beginning of a whole new era of Nintendo.Right now this is all just as far as we know. Theres been some slight rumors of perhaps the joycon controllers having motion sensors and maybe the tablet will have a touch screen but thats not confirmed yet and with the way the hardware operates it seems unlikely but I guess well know for sure tonight. Im doubtful it will have any of that stuff though third party companies have been going crazy over this thing and everyone seems to want to get back into Nintendo. Many are excited about hearing how easy it will be to develop games for the Switch considering the hardware of the Wii U was so specific. With the hardware of that system and it having a game changing core peripheral that thing was a pain in the ass to develop for. If a company wanted to get their game on the Wii U they almost had to redevelop the game from scratch. From everything weve heard so far it sounds like its the opposite case for the Switch.,nintendo,dccgx2i,3,t5_2qhnk

10314374,0,t1_dcd5uss,dedicated servers for games maintenance and such you get a free game every month and theyre fairly decent games. Its not free money. Sure they make a pretty penny but largely its due to dedicated servers for games and to maintain them. Part of your  a year go to . The server itself. Each console needs a different set of servers because the consoles are configured differently for the most part. microsoft is breaking out of this Part of the money goes from Nintendo renting that server for the game. so its like youre renting it from the games publisher but Nintendo is the middle man. . Server maintenance. Because you dont want to be glitching out all the damn time. see ps before PS was a thing and every CoD game ever. Lack of dedicated servers free online multiplayer means a lot more downtime of servers.  .

10314888,0,t1_dcd7tq6,How many free XBL games arent just  or less and what about the fact that you need PS to access all of your free games. Im here to see what was going on with the Switch and Im not impressed and if Nintendo doesnt end up releasing BotW on Wii U then theyll lose me as a customer wholl just buy all their physical products second hand to make sure they dont get any of my money. Nintendo exclusives also havent been all that impressive either in my opinion. Hell knowing the history of Super Mario  and the fact that they stole a lot of ideas from a Croc prototype just makes me lose even more respect for Nintendo. If Nintendo goes third party then that just proves my point about traditional consoles becoming irrelevant. Sony and MS are pretty much making stripped down PCs because they know that PC is a huge threat and doing so allows them to do better than Nintendo. I think that people who pay to play online are misinformed and dont know about PC gaming enough to just think of it as a platform you need to spend  on just to be on par with last gen consoles. There really is a majority of consoles gamers who think this.At least when someone does something crappy on PC I dont need to direct my anger at the platform itself but whatever entity that utilizes PC. Something terrible happening on consoles affects the entire image of that console something terrible happening on PC just affects that publisher or online platform. Anyone remember Digital Homicide and how the PC community dealt with them? Putting your trust in a community is far more fruitful than putting your trust in a large corporation that just sees you as a dollar sign.EDIT Just rewatched the trailer and I guess it is coming out of Wii U.,nintendo,dcd8yx5,1,t5_2qhnk

10321831,0,t1_dce010h,I agree that its worth something but I dont think its the same conclusion that you  have.Judging a consoles launch titles means taking into account quantity quality and availabilityexclusivity. Its also an important means of judging just how much rd party support the console has.Quality  hard to say but Zelda looks good.Quantity  This is extremely low. To be fair PS was as well but as you said they also had games available on the PC the Switch doesnt even have that.Exclusivity  Ya definitely has exclusives and I think this is the main driving force behind Nintendo sales at this point. The fact that games that are cross platform are available on launch indicates that theres strong rd party support for the console. This is an area that Nintendo has traditionally been weak about. In the case of the PS and Xbox One the fact that theyre using x processors means its a lot easier to release games for multiple platforms meaning so either console will have strong rd party support so lots of game choice.Nintendo being the holdouts need to show that they to will have strong staying power and will be able to have good rd party support but they havent really done so with their launch. Thats how consumer judge the value of the console. No one is pyaing  and then shelling out  so they can only play Zelda. They expect to play other games in the future. The more Nintendo can bring to the table the better value it is. They can continue to sell their console on the fact that they have Nintendo exclusive but that will just continue to force them into a niche which will just drive down their market share until theyre forced to give up their exclusives. Thats not to say that the Switch is a bad console or going to do poorly in the market but Nintendo doesnt seem to be doing as good a job at competing with Microsoft and Sony which will continue to cause them problems in the future. ,nintendo,dce1bhu,1,t5_2qhnk

10323435,0,t1_dcdhqm5,The problem with the iOS mario game was the price paying  for a app is just to much especially when you get just  more worlds with  levels each. And then theres the DRM thing. No one said the devs should not get paid for there work. I never complained about paying  for a Zelda game on the contrary I went for the collectors edition. But removing features and making you pay for them just because the competitors are doing it isnt right. If you are going to make me pay for online either sell the game for less. make it a lot better than it was. PsXbox players have been paying for online services even for cross platform games like cod or rocket league how was their experience gotten better? servers for games dont cost any more for consoles so why are they paying? Removing online and making you pay for it is like launching a game with first day dlc you remove featurescontent without reducing the price. People dont complain if they feel that the price for something is fair that they didnt get ripped off or cheated. Paying for something that should be free even though it was never really free nothing is it was just added to the price of the game isnt going to sit well with most. tldr me being devils advocateexplaining my point of view to the guy that is complaining about people complaining. ,nintendo,dce7v76,6,t5_2qhnk

10323646,0,t1_dce6pv8, this.  I worked at a Canadian Best Buy for a number of years and we wouldnt find out stock allocation on this type of thing until days before but God help you if you took a preorder and cant honor it.  Im sure corporate has the numbers but they sure werent shared with us in a timely way.In general a nonlimited number of preorders would be taken towards games because it was expected that the store would receive enough stock of major releases to cover them.  Only once or twice do I remember falling short on a major release which is bad for everyone because that also means customers coming in off the street have zero opportunity.  Hardware sales are a whole other animal  they need to line up.  Corporate informs the stores of what limited number they can take initially and then firms the actual number later... Usually with a few bonus units at the actual ship date. ,nintendo,dce8q81,5,t5_2qhnk

10324572,0,t1_dcebv0i,Personally Nintendo consoles are a different breed for me. I love my PS and PC but theres a lot of games that only show up on Nintendo systems that are third party. Professor Layton many Atlus and Level games Xenoblade Monster Hunter etc. Im not a stickler for graphics as long as a game deals with it well like using a cartoonish style. Thats why I LOVE Nintendo consoles. Since I dont care about a console being powerful Im much happier paying less money for a Nintendo console and having the neat features like the portability. I get that some people like you only want to own one console so they want Nintendo to be powerful enough to have all the PS and Xbox One games as well... but Im gonna own a PS either way for the awesome exclusives.,nintendo,dcecikc,2,t5_2qhnk

However in my case I think of a Nintendo console seperately from Sony and Microsoft. Ive almost always owned both a Nintendo and Other console and have had all  before. Once you get through the overlap of rd party titles and realize that half of the problems come from the developers having some of that Nintendo sux mentality and not caring enough to actually port their games.

The first is one of the most unique shooters I have ever played and my favorite Wii U game.Mario Kart  is the best Mario Kart yet it terms of looking great tight controls and fun maps. Deluxe looks even better with balloon battle back. Also  cc is just silly.Also futures there will be a smash bros. Reggie made a weird comment yesterday about Metroid. Hopefully we will see their party support to fill some gaps.It may not be a console for every one but it looks amazing to me.,nintendo,dceyr9f,1,t5_2qhnk

10367759,0,t1_dciwpz3,I disagree. The gamepad was bogged down with a few unnecessary gimmicks such as a camera and mic that made it more expensive than it was. Even nintendo themselves didnt know what to do with it and enhance the experience. The only best ever experience you would get out of it is in nintendo land.

10375240,0,t1_dck2msf,Over their entire existence in the video game industry they have posted three relatively small annual losses  the total sum of which amounts to less than the profit they made in  alone. By comparison its possible Microsoft are still in the red across three generations of trying and Sonys gaming division has more than once lost more in one year than that sum of Nintendos three losses. Anyone who thinks its Nintendo sinking after a failed system or even a theoretical second isnt in command of the facts simple or otherwise.But all thats by the by really  as Nintendo see it its the industry thats in danger of sinking. If it does MS and Sony can walk away as the bulk of their money is made in other markets. Nintendos business is video games. They wont trust their fate to entities with much less skin in the game. Its why Sega kept trying right until they couldnt  it was the final sputtering out of cash reserves that killed them even as the Dreamcast picked up steam.,nintendo,dck3h2q,15,t5_2qhnk

10378707,0,t1_dckdyi1,does it matter its not a twitch game?  By that logic why does it need anything above N polygon counts? Why does it need voice acting? Why does it need anything above p resolution? fps looks feels and plays better than fps and just because its not a Devil May Cry game or First Person Shooter doesnt mean it shouldnt matter. fps affects things like input lag just because Zelda doesnt require twitch input doesnt mean it doesnt affect the experience as a whole at all. fps isnt REQUIRED to effectively play the game but that applies to a ton of shit in videogames.

10381917,0,t1_dciaqk8,The storytelling not being the primary concern doesnt mean that the storytelling didnt exist or that Other Ms storytelling is somehow better for being more in focus anyone familiar with games could play Other M and explain to you how the first few games told a significantly better story.  Complex is not automatically better a storydriven game does not automatically have a better story than a gameplaydriven game it takes talent and care.  Metroids historical importance in video game narratives also cant be overstated it actually is commonly cited by many modern titles that are known primarily for their narratives it is one of the few ways modern games have actually caught on to using to differentiate the medium from movies or books whether they use the somewhat lazy logbooks or go through the effort of setting up the environment like a crime scene to investigate.The danger of just disregarding Other M is that as far as Nintendo is concerned Other M is still canon and more concerning is that the characterization of Samus in Other M is consistent with Nintendos use of her in other media.  They want her out of her power armor running around in a skintight fetish suit because the dearth of unique female protagonists in their games means they feel obligated to use Samus for sex appeal in their marketing.  As far as we know this is how Nintendo will go forward with other Metroid games she will continue to have her feminine characteristics emphasized at the expense of what made her so notable and beloved to begin with.  It is important we continue to raise a stink about this to make it clear that we still want Metroid games but not one with a sexist portrayal well still like Samus even if our eyes arent glued to her baby blue butt.,nintendo,dckurss,1,t5_2qhnk

They might make a SKU of the switch without the dock and grip just a p machine for a lower price but theyll never make another portable.Its no surprise theyve migrated to ARM architecture. Any game they make could easily be ported to iPhone or Android if the switch were to fail. They could even make a handheld case for phones that held the joycons.All that would have to happen is for a next Gen or two gen away phone to include a gpu and it could be possible.I dont see the switch failing but it is a possible plan B.We may also see all the mobile games have a switch version considering the points above.,nintendo,dckyw6n,1,t5_2qhnk

Breath of the Wild Splatoon  Super Mario all on the go without having to swap out their cartridges just like they had it set up for their DS.Now they have to buy a large SD card to get some of their games on it. The ambition and openworld aspects of many of the games are going to eat up a lot of space on the internal and SD storage.That comments not meant to be confrontational or anything Im not assuming you meant anything deeper from what you said just musing on the problems digital customers will face.

Surely the Switch can handle that?Xbox and Playstation have had mics plugged into controllers for years. Nintendo can do that. The best part is that now those controllers can power the microphones meaning on Switch the tablet battery life doesnt need to be used to power a microphone.Then for games that require more motion like Arrns a wireless solution could be made available.If absolutely necessary a phone app could be used but that should be a last resort. How do I use headphones to hear my game audio and chat audio when they come from two different devices?And this doesnt even explain why match making is done through the phone app as it seems to be. ,nintendo,dcmxtqi,3,t5_2qhnk
10401621,0,t1_dcmso2g,Yea Im kind of excited for the app as well. Seems like it has some potential and cool use cases that Nintendo will hopefully provide for.I get that people are iffy about voice chat and matchmaking potentially being exclusive to the app. But Id like to point out that we know very few confirmed details regarding what the app can do for online and especially what the Switch will do.Keep in mind that Mariokart and Splatoon release in April and during the summer respectively both being games that rely quite heavily on their online experience while the mobile app will only have a sort of preliminary version during the summer and the full version is merely planned for fall  according to their website. This means that there pretty much has to be some way of doing some of this stuff with just the console.,nintendo,dcn39q9,2,t5_2qhnk

Its initially cheaper the games are all cheaper and it has a huge established library available to buy already with more still coming out. If there are a bunch of games you want that are on the DS Id say get that first.

10422582,0,t3_5p6d33,Ive been thinking about this a lot lately. I dont want to see a full reboot but maybe its time to break some conventions in Metroid beginning with the name. Historically Metroid has never been a hot seller so why stick with the name? On top of that I feel there is so much more to the Metroid series than metroids themselves.With that said I have to have a new game in the style of the Prime games. Perhaps go into a different direction with the series but just keep the firstperson shooter aspect. With all of that tech in the joycons I can imagine so many fun possibilities.,nintendo,dcpgw2p,1,t5_2qhnk

10427755,0,t3_5pccpy,Before you comment please watch the video in its entirety and give your nonbias objective opinion.First id like to say Im not a Nintendo hater actually Ocarina of Time is my  favorite game ever and i own several amiibos despite not having a Nintendo console currently. However Ive been really disappointed with them for years. The last time i was really hyped for a Nintendo console was the Gamecube. Last gen i was a Xbox gamer this gen i went with Playstation. I was never interested in the Wii owned a Wii U for a few months and sold it disappointed. i did have a New DS XL which was actually okay not bad. but i didnt find myself playing it much so i traded it in.There are a several thingsjust to name a few that disappoint me about the Switch. Price for the console and accessories. i feel that theyre a bit over priced. Launch line up is underwhelming not that many games and  Switch isnt a pick in? No Normal pro style controller included. Despite all of that i went ahead and decided to give Nintendo ONE more chance. I preordered the Switch BOTW Masters Edition Bomberman R and  BOTW Amiibos. Taking a major leap of faith here for around still need to get the pro controller.In this video he makes a lot very valid points that i agree with. even though Nintendo doesnt consider themselves competition with Sony and Microsoft in reality they are. it just seems like Nintendo is completely okay with being mediocre and being in last place for lack of better works. I dont want Nintendo to fail i want them to succeed. But i fear that theyre just going to keep up this same cycle of BSEven Shokiomajor Nintendo fan boy in this second video seems to be upset about the Switch reveal over all..,nintendo,dcq1z9l,-12,t5_2qhnk

When the Wii U failed and the NX was announced I finally thought we would get a proper home console that was just as capable as the competition. That didnt happen.       I am happy with the what the Switch is and have it preordered but it isnt what I wanted the NX to be. In a way its pretty much my only option if I want to get a supported Nintendo home console without waiting another five or six years to see what they announce next. Others dont see it that way. They would rather Nintendo fail so hard that they are forced to go third party. They are delusional to think that would ever happen.

I maybe played  games on it.  Almost everything rd party was also no PS or Xbox and better.I didnt buy the WiiU.  Same situation.  You have the Nintendo titles and nothing else.Now comes the Switch and it is another weak system that is mobile for some reason and will probably only have the same Nintedo lineup and some weak support.Nintendo is on their rd in a row disappointing console.I have just run out of patience with them.  I  just want them to license their games to PS and Xbox who are more serious about consoles.EDIT Oh yeah.

10485502,0,t1_dcwmlkc,Im just hoping they make the actual act of climbing fun somehow since it seems to be a huge feature that theyre adding. Take Link Between Worlds big feature the painting thing. A simple but actually fun addition that changes the way you think and interact with the world. Theyre making climbing out to be something along those lines in this one lets hope its entertaining this time around.As for the village I guess were assuming its the same one from the trailer? I dunno these screens they keep showing just look empty which solidifies a lot of peoples fears of yet another empty open world game. I personally am gonna have faith that Nintendo knows better and figured out how to make the over world fun like in the D zeldas I just wish theyd stop showing me Link running on a horse through an empty forest and then slashing the one stray bokoblin thats chilling alone,nintendo,dcwn2qj,1,t5_2qhnk
10486469,0,t1_dcwc0b2,Seriously if the Switch ends up with a full library like the DS has PLUS its usual console exclusives its going to go great imo. THAT is the idea that got everyone hyped from that first trailer. When Nintendo actually held their press conference those people went from hyped to what the actual fuck? in the span of a day. There was just too many little things that maybe if they were on their own wouldnt have made people think twice  the price point the online stuff the cost of peripherals utter lack of discussing the DS franchises etc etc  but together killed the hype for a lot of people. That should tell everyone both that a people were hyped and love the IDEA of it but b theyre also well aware of Nintendos history and wary of investing so much money upfront for something Nintendo seems resistant to say will happen at all aka it getting DS games and is maybe too expensive for what theyre perceiving is the actual value. That will probably get better in a couple of years if it gets a bigger library or price drop though.,nintendo,dcwr11r,10,t5_2qhnk
10487611,0,t1_dcwtc9s,To be fair thats not really his argument with the Switch. His argument is that Nintendo messed up in marketing this as a console instead of just a powerful handheld.

It also seems pretty neat and theres a ton of potential for interesting applications. The Wii Us gamepad and the Wiis motion controls and the Ns rumble pack were all IMO also gimmicks. The gamepad didnt pan out the motion controls have become a standard Nintendo feature and the rumble pack was such a success that it was weird when the Sixaxis didnt have it.I imagine HD rumble is going to be somewhere around motion controls on that spectrum.,nintendo,dcxk2w9,2,t5_2qhnk

10497991,0,t1_dcy0t1x,I dont believe its that much. Each and every Pokmon is linked to their OT so its easy to trace back and if the OT never existed then it may require a little more investigation. But Game Freak knows there are a LOT of little kids out there who play Pokmon and likely received a perfect Shiny Pokmon off Wonder Trade and want to show it off in battle to their friends. They know immediately banning anyone who use Pokmon that are too perfect will result in a backlash which is why they only have  confirmed cases and I dont believe weve heard any one of those  complaining.

Hell SanDisk says you void the warranty if you use them in a dash cam.This is true for all flash storage including SSDs and for all brands. Its just a problem of the technology and cant be fixed.The reason that flash storage eventually fails is due to the way that the storage needs to be prepared when new data is written to it. Before a cell can be populated it must first be erased. This erasure process has a negative impact on the storage itself and each cell can only withstand a certain number of erasures before that cell ultimately becomes unusable.gt but there are quite a few horror stories online with them so Im going to get Samsung since they seem to be very solid.There are horror stories online for literally everything look up Samsung SD card fails.

They now have stock that will not be resupplied so they either get to sell the remaining units or Nintendo buys their machines back.Now that its been discontinued the hunt begins for collectors as rarity and thus value will only increase over time. Id normally add the qualifier of until computers can emulate them perfectly but the GamePad has a lot of functionality thatd need to be emulated well on a PC including displaying its screen in addition to the main screen.

10696663,0,t1_ddiv8k4,Well on one hand despite having the casual mode the games are still weighted towards permadeath. They have to be otherwise theyd be too hard if you chose classic. It makes a big difference in strategy and every unique unit seems more irreplaceable when you can actually lose them.On the other hand it can be a very frustrating mechanic especially on later maps that can take an hour. Not always fun to restart a map due to a stray crit.Its up to you nobody is going to come to your house and yell at you for playing on casual. Id personally at least set the difficulty to hard because in normalcasual you can just walk on your enemies faces except maybe in the Fates Conquest campaign but whatever.,nintendo,ddja4rp,2,t5_2qhnk

10766515,0,t1_ddqe1ch,EA is one of the companies I was talking about that made the term DLC hated so much. Think of games like Skyrim or Witcher  that have amazing DLC. BotW is in the same genre as those and Nintendo knows that so they will attempt to make a comparable DLC. ,nintendo,ddqhilq,1,t5_2qhnk
10767469,0,t1_ddqjev8,True.  Maybe the base game actually isnt the whole game but that doesnt mean its not a complete game.  Certain games coming out today reasonably should cost more than  dollars and in my opinion this game is one of them. Its just good for the consumer climate that theyre making the  dollar version an option instead of a requirement.  And the DLC isnt out right off the bat you can just get a season pass like other games like Dark Souls  or something where no one was upset but instead were hyped at the thought of more content. Yes they give you a few additions but thats basically a preorder bonus for dlc which I think is a seperate issue.,nintendo,ddql23b,2,t5_2qhnk

10770851,0,t1_ddqi167,gt Ive heard good things about Fire Emblem Awakenings DLCI would say that a lot of Nintendos DLC packs are very good value. Mario Karts were like  of the cost of the game for  more tracks and several new characters. That was great. Hyrule Warriors amp Legends both had DLC that cost around rd of the cost of the game and added huge amounts of content several new weapons and so forth. They were great. Awakening... not so much. Set  was overall pretty bland the maps were fun once but at around  for  maps they were very expensive for what you got which was typically about  hours entertainment.  Set was mixed. The grinding pack were for grinding which feels a bit like pay to win. The scramble pack had a ton of entertaining conversations and was worth it from that point of view although you could arguably enjoy it almost as much just by looking up the conversations. The challenge pack was quite good. Future Past though is the big exception that pack was  worth it and Id say almost was how the game should have ended. Oh and Apotheosis which is a thing.Overall Id say Awakenings DLC... get Future Past skip the rest. Maybe Lost Bloodlines III for Grinding as well.Oh and as an asidegtSmashs DLC was goodPersonally I thought it was overpriced for what you got. Each new fighter was . to . which when the game is about  to  is about th to th of the price of the original game which seems very very steep. Id have been willing to pay maybe about  to . per new character which is around thth of the games price but they were over double that. I like the game but yeesh Id basically be paying the cost of the game again just for  extra characters. Maybe if theyd done a bundle Id have considered it assuming it ended up somewhere reasonable such as around . But AFAIK they never did.,nintendo,ddqxmh2,6,t5_2qhnk

Basically something along the lines of Smash Wii U ..I also think that such a game if it does happen as I expect will serve as the Switchs Smash game.

10802661,0,t3_5uhlpo,Its hard to tell since we dont know where BotW takes place in the Zelda timeline. However Anouma gave hints saying it took place in a time where Ganon frequently attacks which is the downfall timeline. So the important games plotwise to take not of in the downfall timeline are OoT ALttP ALBW TLoZ and AoL. Also there is a slight distinguishing between Ganondorf and Ganon Ganon usually refers to Ganondorfs piglike demon form and in the downfall timeline he only appears in this form implying he has become more demonlike and lost all of his humanity.OoT has a desert tribe thief king named Ganondorf who somewhat soon after a Hyrulian Civil War had ended between the Hyrulian races goes to make a peace treaty with the King of Hyrule who united Hyrule but with the real intentions of stealing the Triforce from the Hylians which is locked in the Temple of Time because the full triforce grants a wish and individual pieces its made of  boost your power somehow. Ganondorf tries to get in Link tries to stop him bc Zelda had a forboding dream of Ganon trying to take over and Link stopping him so she gets Link to go on an adventure and Link accidentally lets Ganondorf into the Sacred Realm when he pulls the Master Sword the lock so to speak. This puts him in a  year coma. So when Ganondorf took the triforce his heart was unbalanced leading it to split between people who best represent each virtue he kept power Link got courage Zelda got Wisdom. With Link in a coma in a different dimension and Zelda having fled with her ninja handmaiden Impa Ganondorf takes over Hyrule. Link wakes up goes on a quest to awaken the sages who can give him the power to confront Ganondorf confronts Ganodorf at his castle and in the downfall timeline fails causing different events to happen. Ganondorf is later defeated by the sages and knights of hyrule ALttPs backstory and sealed away in the Sacred Realm eventually corrupting the realm into the Dark World. As this happens differently than when Link defeats Ganondorf and seals him it causes vastly different events. In this case Ganon having become more demonlike partially slips out of the Dark WorldSacred Realm hundreds of years later as a wizard named Agahnim and climbs the political ladder up to an advisor to the king due to being thought of as a priest. Now in ALttP His influence spreads and its implied the king is dead and he begins trying to find the descendants of the sages to sacrifice them so hes no longer sealed. He does so and the last one is Zelda who calls out to Link in a dream. Link goes to save Zelda shenanigans ensue Link goes to the Dark World to rescue the  maidens descendants of sages and kills Ganon with the Light Arrows and Master Sword. Then he makes a wish on the complete triforce for Ganons evil to be undone which cleanses the Sacred Realm brings the King and Links Uncle back to life and a theory states that this is what causes Link not to fail back in OoT causing a split however its just conjecture.Skip a few hundred years or just a hundred and ALBW happens which if we only care about Ganons involvement Ganon is revived by a wizard from a different dimension Lorule who then absorbs Ganon for his power so he can take Hyrules triforce Lorule broke theirs. That Link stops him yada yada.So skipping some plotwise unimportant games Hyrule has a Golden Age where they own the triforce. At some point there is a King a Prince and Princess Zelda. The King doesnt trust the Prince with the whole triforce so he splits up the triforce gives Zelda the ToWisdom hides the Courage one and I think keeps the power one. When the King dies the Prince demands Zelda tell him where this shit is but Zelda is like nah so another evil wizard advisor casts that Zelda into an eternal sleep. The Prince is sad banishes wizard and then decrees that all further princesses will be named Zelda. Skipping hundred or so years Ganon has been revived and conquered Hyrule and taken the Triforce of Power. Current Zelda breaks the Triforce of Wisdom and scatters it across the land to keep it out of Ganons reach. Current Link goes out searches the land recovers all  pieces gets the Silver Arrows and slays Ganon with them. Yay.Now a few years later on that previous Links th birthday a triforce crest appears on his hand. Impa Zeldas handmaiden tells him its the mark of courage and he may be the only one to recover the ToC. She then drops some history on him about that Zelda that got put into an eternal coma and that with the ToC or full triforce? he can wake her up. So he sets out to put these stones in these Palaces to unlock the Great Palace that houses the Triforce of Courage. Meanwhile Ganons minions want to revive Ganon which they apparently need Links blood to do so they try to kill him. At the Great Palace Link faces his final challenge Links Shadow which then proves him worthy of the Triforce of Courage. He then wakes up Coma Zelda in the Northern Palace starting point gets a smooch and now theres  Zeldas at that point. So thats the plot of the main Zelda games in the timeline most likely to house BotW though its unknown at which point it takes place at.Also throughout BotW stuff Sheikah technology and symbols have been rampant so I guess some slight Sheikah history is necessary. The Sheikah are a secretive tribe that served the Hylian Royal Family as basically the CIA. They had a tortureinterrogation dungeon and stuff were good at shadow magicseeing through illusions etc. Then they were almost wiped out for some reason I think by the Hylians. Impa and I guess Sheik is the only known Sheikah character.Also theres different Links and Zeldas bc when the first Link killed the Demon King Demise in Skyward Sword first game Demise essentially turned his hatred into a curse that would reincarnate becoming part of Ganondorf. Links spirit is reincarnated as a Hero to combat this hatred as well as Zeldas shes a bit different but you should play SS to find out.,nintendo,ddu7v38,11,t5_2qhnk

So tired of seeing guys in their basements write better emulators that even run on Nintendo hardware than the actual VC offerings Nintendo puts up. Theyre not even trying and I dont think its very difficult to make the case that they gimp their own services on purpose. For all the crying about piracy where is our new D Metroid? Where is Advance Wars? Am I supposed to believe that Golden Sun is not coming back because too many people pirated it? They dont care. They just want to milk those old games as long as they can by maintaining artificial scarcity and resetting the catalog every few years.The online subscription is a great example. They could have just said play as much VC as you want its included in the price and everyone would have bought the subscription. Its basically netflix for nintendo. But no this is Nintendo so you get to play one VC game per month. Then theyre gonna wonder why nobody wants to pay a subscription just to play Splatoon and maybe Mario Kart.

But because there was no story to this content were in an an isnt lost civilization that succumbed to the wastes of the desert. Can you tell me more than bzzt brtt I love mining time stones!

10897007,0,t1_de3ukjw,You really dont. They could technincally if you have a console push a firmware update that allows them to forbid your system from playing whatever game they want. They wont do it because it would lose them customers the same way they wont take away your digital games. If you are too worried you can buy on gog which has no DRM and is basically the same as owning the physical media you can have as many backups as you want install it in however many devices you want etc.. And they dont push updates you can choose when you update or wether you dont want to. About nerfs buffs and other patchesmoddifications... well they do this to keep games interesting or to fix issues to keep it fun. Theres a risk they will fuck up of course and make it worse so if you dont like that you do exactly what you said dont purchase them but it is necessary for some games i.e. Starcraft had to patch patch the Zerg rush because it would have killed the game to have an unstoppable early game strategy that ended matches in less than  minutes.There are some multiplayer games that have legacy servers in order to play older versions though.Digital goods are not the dystopian terrifying future some people make it out to be.

I think Aonuma said Nintendo came to him and said in April of  they wanted BotW on Switch launch so get busy.  I get it takes time and having a Zelda as a launch title is SUPER important especially when you have almost nothing else which is concerning from a launch perspective.  But also remember PS and XB didnt have many launch titles either a lot of their stuff was brand new  games that were ported to XB for launch.

Probably wont be as drastic on a Nintendo console but with the small size youre going to fill that up extremely quickly.And yes you can buy alternate storage solutions but secondary storage especially SD cards are not going to run as smoothly as an internal memory device.

10939756,0,t3_5w85t8,Xenoblade Chronicles is my favorite game of all time so naturally I am pretty excited for Xenoblade Chronicles .Ill probably pass on Fire Emblem Warriors but the mainline Fire Emblem game is something I really want to see.Super Mario Oddyssey is probably going to be a great game. Mario games arent really my thing although I do quite like Sunshine but if its as good as everyone hopes it will be Im picking it up.The Tales game coming for the system might be interesting so Ill be looking out for that.I never got Shovel Knight on PCDS so Ill probably get it sometime on the Switch. Treasure Trove seems like great bang for your buck.Im probably getting YookaLaylee too. I didnt originally expect it to be full priced but I doubt thats going to deter me from buying the game haha.Also naturally Im looking out for any further firstparty titles from Nintendo.

I instead get more hyped and I want the game more and more.Now this is also before we compare the  dev team of nintendos hallowed most critically acclaimed game series compared to a  man indie dev team that lied to the public.

The part where he plays on a TV was a small portion of that commercial when comparing total screen time.In statements Nintendo is wisely playing up the home console aspect because the Wii U is dead meat and the DS isnt. If they came out and said the truth  ie the Switch will be our one console going forward it would kill the DS and Nintendo doesnt have a sub Switchbased offering ready to replace those consoles for the small children market.

The writers apparently never were taught the basic storytelling motto show dont tell.  Almost every bit of Samus supposed character development is narrated to the player andor or shown in flashbacks which is a big nono.  I dont need to hear Samus tell me her reaction to Adam showing up on the ship just make her freaking react and let me see it.  Samus feels the need to narrate her feelings on every person she meets but if the writers and animators are any good we should be able to pick up on those subtleties ourselves.  If something is sad or unfair let us experience it with Samus and be upset ourselves.  Dont have Samus complain to us for five minutes.  Thats just annoying and makes Samus look weak.  Furthermore I dont need to hear Samus entire history with the Federation in a big monologuing infodump.  Thats like writing .  If you want us to know events that happened before the game have Anthony or someone ask Samus about it.

I think that the Wii U has great casual play but I think its just determined based on how you use your system or PC and for what. I use my PC to play high demand games that I wouldnt be able to run well or as well on a console I also use it for FPS since I cant go back to an analogcontrolscheme.

I agree that digital is the way to go in terms of costs but does the cost of forcing people to have reliable internet which a lot of people do not actually have mind you outweigh the cost of making cartridges and CDs?The answer in my opinion is no. You need internet for digital purchases. A company cant make money if people arent buying the game because they cant sign in whenever they want.The struggle for me to get internet was unbelievable for me just three years ago. I know for a fact that in my area and others no doubt it has not gotten a whole lot better.Heck data caps seem to be making a comeback which just discourages digital content even more.,nintendo,dekf3pg,1,t5_2qhnk

11062148,0,t1_delmzcf,Cooking is actually really simple and straight forward and you can basically work out every result from ingredients alone. Ill explain below in the spoiler text. Also press X to skip the cooking animation.Cooking SPOILERS. There are two categories of ingredients for cooking. Do NOT mix them or it will result in Dubious Food. The categories are Meal Foodstuff inc. fruit mushrooms other plants meat fish etc. basically things normally used in cooking and Elixir components critters bugs and monster parts. Each ingredient will usually indicate what to combine it with in the description look for keywords like meal critter etc.. Each recipe you cook can only have one modifier. Modifiers are things like Restores Stamina Defence Bonus Resists Heat. If you cook a dish with multiple modifiers it will result in only one on the meal. NOTE Consuming a meal with a timed modifier Defenceattack bonus resist heat will overwrite any current bonus modifier effects you have going.. Adding more ingredients increases what the meal does. Regular non modifier ingredients ie. Apples Bokoblin Horn increase the basic properties of the dish. For meals ingredients like apples or meat will make the dish heal for more. For Elixirs more monster parts will increase the effect duration. Adding more of a modifier ie. Spicy Pepper will increase the potency of the effect so higher element resistance greater stat bonus.spoiler,nintendo,delvk7w,0,t5_2qhnk

There were twothree factors that were on a feedback cycle that made it have a poor reception One was third parties were not bringing games they were already developing for other systems to the Wii U because it was too weak.The Wii U did bad because Nintendo were high on Wiimania everything from the release on flopped. Some people still dont know what a Wii U is and call the Switch Oh is that the new Wii?.I assumed Nintendos plan since Wii hasnt been to directly compete but be an auxiliary console catering to fun localmultiplayer than sprawling technical advancements games like horizon.,nintendo,dema9i5,2,t5_2qhnk

Just put your thumb and index finger together and apply very little pressure backwards and the other forwards. If anything youd be looking at the way the joints are angled or not.

11077996,0,t1_deno23g,If any of those games come out on PC they could potentially come out on Switch. Graphics can be adjusted to fit lower end systems and some games run on really well optimized engines. Heck PS and XB are practically PCs now. Porting stuff aint what it used to be.Do I expect most major AAA games to get Switch releases? No but I dont think its impossible like you say it is. You also have to look at it as a handheld. AAA franchises still got entries on the Vita and the DS. Kingdom Hearts has games on every Nintendo handheld starting with the GBA for example.Fact of the matter is no one knows what EA Ubi and Activision are doing yet with the Switch so saying whether something can or cannot happen is pointless.

11086382,0,t1_deolss0,Hm. Yeah I suppose thats fair.But then Horizon Zero Dawn has stats and leveling and Id actually consider it more of an actionadventure because theres not really much to the game outside of the main linear story.

11089069,0,t1_deo65it,Nintendo and Sega are very different companies.  Make a list of some of your favorite Segadeveloped games prior to them going thirdparty and compare it to a list of your favorite Nintendodeveloped games prior to when Sega went thirdparty.The first Nintendo system I owned was a Gamecube I grew up with a Genesis.  I still dont have nearly as many fond memories of my time playing old Sega games as I have of playing old Nintendo games at other peoples houses because they were so much better.Sega has Sonic a character designed by an advertising committee to make it clear that Sega is faster and edgier than Nintendo and their boring plumber.  It turns out though the boring plumber moves at a speed thats more conducive to good gameplay and its important to have more than a couple good games in a multidecade franchise.Whats left of classic Segas fanbase seems to run almost exclusively on nostalgia.  Nintendo doesnt need nostalgia their games were good back then and theyre still great now.,nintendo,deoxpui,4,t5_2qhnk

11092524,0,t1_depbipp,Theres a wealth of information out there on why Microsoft is a bad company to do business with as a business or a consumer. I can share a few of my personal reasons but youre better off answering that question for yourself. Im not here to convince anyone.For me it boils down to control over my hardware privacy and security. At least on the OS side. On the gaming side I just dont like the way their console and controllers look or feel. They also dont have any exclusives that I care about. Im technically in their target demographic early s male but none of what they offer appeals to me.Sonys not a favorite of mine either but damnit the Souls games are too good... so I picked up a PS a while back. No PS or XB for me. PS is getting a few games I want but the hardware is unreliable as piss just like the PS the first few years. Ill wait for the inevitable slim version that fixes the prior issues then get the games I care about on the cheap just like I did for the PS.But mostly I just dont trust Microsoft. Its part of why I dont use Windows as my primary OS too. Its hard for people to take you seriously if you distrust a company but then use their products. You know? P,nintendo,depbszj,3,t5_2qhnk

SO got to start the adventure because I can pick up mechanics quicker. Thats probably the only turn order we predetermined. The hardest part is deciding where we want to go next and how to go about getting there because we are completionists.

11101776,0,t1_deqai51,Their games are so good people buy their consoles that they hate just to play them. It sounds like we are saying the same thing to me. I dont have an Xbox because none of their exclusives are must play games to me. I enjoyed halo   and reach. I enjoyed gears  amp  and I liked state of decay quite a bit but their sequels dont really intrigue me and their new IPs are few and far between.Sony and Nintendo though they make some damned good exclusives which provide more value in entertainment than anything else out there. The price of the system is negligible when you see the value over time. Per hour of use I have spent about  when added all together for the PS. Nintendo is used more when I have friends over so its not as often but its for longer periods. Its value is around . per hour of use but thats among  people. Compare that to the price of movie tickets going to a concert sporting event an amusement park etc...,nintendo,deqdkjk,1,t5_2qhnk

The joycon issue is one I can understand  And Nintendo has acknowledged in some form as it is wildly reported but the screen scratching is fueled by paranoia.

11118980,0,t1_derzk6z,It sounds like youre arguing that Nintendo fans should have just lied to people about the Wii U in the hopes that theyd buy one without doing their own research. And I cant agree with that. No Im not. I recommended buying a Wii U to people sincerely because I thought it was a good console with some great games. Someone at work bought one a couple of Christmases ago for his kids and to this day he still comes up and tells me how much theyre enjoying it and asks me what games he should get next for them. Youre attitude is the problem because it assumes that just because the Wii U had problems it was worthless and thats not true. ,nintendo,desbt35,3,t5_2qhnk

11126760,0,t1_det5nmj,gtThats just the issueIts completely separate from amiibo support being OP in one particular game.gtto get what game devs used to include as part of the main gameActually cheat codes seemed to have disappeared in general around the mid s from every game I played. Its only the classics that still had them. My point being is that there was no straight transition from Heres free content to Heres paywalled content. There was a middle phase of Heres no additional content.That is separate from the DLC you mentioned on the side Ill recognize that.While I too am not a fan of features being locked behind paywalls I do see value in the amiibos themselves and wanting to be able to tie them into a game like we used to see with eReaders.The trick is just getting the balance right in what content is provided in the game in conjunction with an amiibo. Personally Id like it to only unlock stuff that is just a new colordesign of existing content not anything that is new. In Splatoon this was partially done  the rewards for completing missions was just a different design or skin of existing content. Theres a partial issue in here that the missions themselves should be available for all players to experience possibly unlocked late in the game and amiibos would just be a shortcut to it or enable getting the rewards for completing the missions. Additionally the minigame awards that they unlock shouldnt be paywalled. So while the Splatoon amiibos come close by not upsetting any balance in multiplayer there are offline features that are paywalled so they arent perfect.,nintendo,det7iy3,1,t5_2qhnk

11150342,1,t1_devv5nr,Climbing is a non combat exploration mechanic. Ive definitely seen stats that show that girls and women are just less interested in combat than males. Having a way to advance in the game that deemphasizes combat while giving stuff for you to do crafting and exploring really is a way to broaden the appeal of a game.People do like stereotyped stuff in their games. It isnt speaking poorly of men to say that they like blowing shit up. Those preferences are real in the aggregate. Thats why I think its good and inclusive to actively include elements that girlswomen are going to like.The idea that we should all have the same tastes and preferences is in itself a little sexist as it prevents designers from giving different types of people the things they like.,nintendo,devvnvv,-1,t5_2qhnk

11162730,0,t3_5zbyff,Its definitely real if it wasnt for Zelda the game would get mediocre reviews and the flaws would make it a bit overlooked FPS drops would be called out and the game would be called broken like Skyrim at launch on consoles.The lore if it wasnt for Zelda would be kinda lazy but because its Zelda that put those first its accepted Wind Fire Sand Water stuff.But the polish is what makes it a high score game its insane regarding the value you get the experience and the gameplay its something that other games lost throughout the years that Zelda still manage to find Skyrim is dull compared to Morrowind and Oblivion was already on the same path and what Nintendo still find after every game even on new licenses though it seems harder and harder to push them i wouldnt call Splatoon and Arms anticipated hits or franchises.Theres some examples of this with multiple licenses that tries to catch the tune of those games and most of the time fail Beyond Good and Evil was actually the best contender to Zelda and yet it failed at launch while being praised years later after its launch Darksiders being called a Zelda like because it never managed to get out of this statement even though they tried hard to make something new and unique.Theres a reason the Miyazaki movies are so praised because every movie is something different something from the imaginary and odd looking but the world always seems cohesive and alive and thats exactly what Zelda manages to do by using the tropes they created  years ago.So yeah if it wasnt for the Zelda lore and popularity the game would get mediocre reviews as unique and creative it can get theres always the Zeldalike term that will remain forever.,nintendo,dexa7xm,-1,t5_2qhnk

There were a lot of obvious things and mechanics that he was just missing the point of as well.As I said I like Jim Sterling  I watch his stuff often but I already experienced his review just from what he talked about the game before he posted his review and it made me realize that he wasnt really someone that I would want to be asking any BotW questions.It is good to get different point of views though.

BotW Pokken Tournament Mario Kart  SSB Mario Maker Super Mario D World Bayonetta  New Super Mario Brows U Yoshis Wooly World Pikmin  Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze Captain Toad Hyrule Warriors Xenoblade Chronicles X Devils Third and Kirby and the Rainbow Curse. Therere also some remakes like Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Thats not to mention the rd party nonexclusive games which are mainly platformers.

11236648,0,t3_609f0v,when PS and Xbox came non the scene and started a push for more mature themed games While nintendo focused on keeping stuff like mario pokemon mario kart and adding stuff like cute and loveable pikmin. nintendo stuck with what they knew and the most mature games they published at the time was metroid prime series and eternal darkness. theyve had a few other lesser known titles like killer  and such as that but they were never nearly as big draws as call of duty GTA Red Dead series Mafia Metal Gear etc.Estinally nintendo stayed in the past with peoples childhood IPs Sony and Xbox published games like Halo gears of war God of War and Killzone. Nintendo is clearly more familykid friendly as a platform and they made that choice themselves.

Theres a reason Nintendo has really been the only company to hold my interest and its because through it all they have been respectful in the way they use your time.

11277203,0,t3_60y7g7,Im in the same boat never owned before looking for a Nintendo Classic and Switch already purchased BotW so theres not much I can do with it except lick the cartridge... but its almost certainly not an artificial stock issue noone including Nintendo tries intentionally to throw away profits to enrich scalpers. The real answer is that manufacturing and supply is complex prone to issues at every step of the way and even more so for new products untested in the market.Factory leadtime is months and it takes the better part of another month just to get alreadymanufactured and packaged retailready stock from a port to the country of destination so how much stock they need to make is guesswork and inflexible  by the time they find out how good their guesswork was it will take months to act on that information. Apparently it was a complete surprise that the Nintendo Classic became as desirable as it turned out to be the reception to it was not at all similar to that of similar devices.On top of all that overproducing something then discovering it doesnt sell can kill a company very quickly with extended warehousing pricecutting retail shelfspace etc you basically have to pay to get rid of it on top of paying to manufacture it on top of losing all your sales revenue so some degree of riskaversion is just good sense.On top of all that for new things like the Switch initial demand will outstrip the previous several months of accumulated production regardless. All consoles including Xbox and Playstation are normally hard to get when they first come out until ongoing production can fill the demand over the following weeks or months.Things generally arent malicious conspiracies theyre just complicated and difficult and it sucks ,nintendo,dfa96bh,11,t5_2qhnk

For this there are  ways to changingobtaining a foreign gameFirst and most common make a new accountIf you make a new account and tie it to a different country you wont have issues.Then there is the second and seems like the most exclusive to the Switch Region SwitchingRegion Switching allows you to change manually your regioncountry from the Switch menuwebsite. This is an AMAZING feature and will allow you to have different games on the same account.There is ONE BIG catch to this one. YOU MUST NOT HAVE ANY BALANCE ON ONE ACCOUNT BEFORE THE REGION SWITCHIf you were to switch you can have balance but there are no conversion rates so you lose all your cash. But after that you can safely buy games from another region.

11314881,0,t3_61f76o,I would argue that all metroid games are open world. Rarely is progress hindered because plot demands it but because you dont have the equipment to progress further. Its a minor but crucial distinction. For instance OoT cant proceed until you get three stones. These stones do nothing for the game itself but the plot demands you grab them before you pull the master sword. Metroid games typically only use that structure to block off the very final area of the game the blinking statues the chozo artifacts the dark world keys etc and the rest progresses organically.And incidentally if I had to stop using my ice beam every  shots until I picked up more sheegoth guts Id probably turn off the game.

11324258,0,t1_dfdo1p5,My two main qualms with BOTW are story and dungeons. Something that I think was done perfectly in SS. SS was ALL about the main story so there were so many objectives you had to do to fulfill that main story. But BOTW is great with gameplay and I know thats the main focus always. I would love to see a return to the traditional big dungeons but put a new spin on it. I think SS was already kind of making those dungeon experiences feel different. The Dungeons in a way felt very much like part of the world you were exploring instead of this very specific place you were entering like it does in older Zelda games. I feel like the next step may be to make the transitions between overworld and dungeon kind of seemless in the next game and make those dungeons feel like part of the world. I do wish we could explore the world in SS like we can in BOTW. And again BOTW is one of the best games ever made. But SS holds a special place in my heart. Its just such a good story and everything you do in that game just feels important. I would also kind of like to go back to a weapon durability system similar to SS mixed in with some elements from BOTW. Where you can go repair weapons you really like and where durability is shown to you. Also maybe some weapons where durability charges back up as long as you dont break it like the goddess shield. All in all though Im excited to see where the franchise goes. But I would definitely welcome back a bigger storyline with more objectives as well as more different kinds of weapons and what not. ,nintendo,dffl3so,2,t5_2qhnk
11324476,1,t1_dfflog4,No. No they are not. The only reason digital and physical versions cost the same is cause the stores would be quite angry if the digital version of games was  bucks cheaper. And they would very likely stop carrying the systems. Seeing as thats still the biggest way people buy systems from a store or online store front they dont want to piss them off. But as GS is the only store to carry it they can charge what they want cause its on them.Sigh. What is it here...,nintendo,dfflzs7,-3,t5_2qhnk

Its like getting drunk when things go bad at home for example. I know that its easier said than done but the much better thing to do is try to fix things around you. Try talking and being friendly to people. You wont get a long with most people but thats not the goal. Talk to your family. Apply yourself in school.

11372995,0,t1_dfkqg65,With Smash getting it on the Switch early in the systems life is a big deal. Smash came too late on Wii U. Nintendo needs the big stuff like Mario Kart Smash etc all out before the  holiday season.gt If you could get Super Mario Sunshine HD without taking away from Nintendos ability to make Super Mario Odyssey  or whatever the next D Mario game is on Switch why wouldnt you want that?Well Sunshine really needs gameplay tweaks so whilst you could still farm it out Id want an actual developer to oversee it not just a pure porting team. A good example is how much better of a remake WWHD is than TPHD the former had most of its gameplay issues fixed the latter almost none of them horses control even worse now.gt People badly wanting Smash  and Mario Kart  goes without saying. You say that but unless Nintendo can make a change that really justifies the existence of a new Mario Kart of Smash I really dont see the point as opposed to just updating the existing game. Like I skipped MK Wii because well it wasnt really improved from Double Dash at all so to me why bother? MKDX will be a pretty perfect Mario Kart game. More trackscharacters IMO does not justify a sequel in fact I dont really see much they could do that justifies a sequel since Mario Kart is by nature simple and theyll never do most of the things Sonic AllStar Racing did because that overcomplicates the game for casuals.,nintendo,dfl3wig,7,t5_2qhnk

11498228,0,t1_dfyzdr9,I liked what SquareEnix did with the Final Fantasy V mobile and PC pseudoremake. Sure the graphics are a little bright and dont resemble the artwork well instead opting to stay faithful to the original sprites. But its faster than the original and movement is directional pixelbypixel. Its a great addition that makes the experience so much better. Final Fantasy VI however that was a pile of suck what was done to it. Im not even confident that another remake would do it justice... Stick too close to the original and you may as well go and play the original but change too much and you anger everyone. I for one didnt like Final Fantasy IV DS so I have little hope of a good FFVI remake. ,nintendo,dfzbo1w,1,t5_2qhnk

11526404,0,t3_64j6og,It depends on whether you have a New DS. If you do its still got some performance issues the Wii U version does not have but its generally okay. In terms of content I believe the DS version has exclusive DLC including characters and skins from Links Awakening and Link Between Worlds but to be honest I havent checked to see if it was ever updated on the Wii U version. Im about  sure it wasnt but someone can certainly correct me.So the direct answer to your question is the Wii U version runs better overall and is the one I would classify as the better game but the New DS version is the most complete version of the game.EDIT As uiOnlySawTokyoDrift pointed out the Wii U received all of the DLC as well so the advantage the DS version has over the Wii U version comes down to portability which may be a significant advantage depending on your individual situation.,nintendo,dg2ipvb,7,t5_2qhnk

11557425,0,t3_64td3y,Does anyone know if the game has a basic Tetris mode in addition to the Puyo Puyo and hybrid modes? Im interested in these too especially after watching this video but Im hoping for a fairly standard Tetris mode as well and strangely cant find information about this on either the Nintendo product page or the Wikipedia article.    Now that the games gone down to  Im definitely interested as long as theres a standard mode like that. Not sure Id be able to get my wife to play it with me if there wasnt that option!    Edit I suppose this bit from Wikipedia    gtPlayers play with either the basic Puyo Puyo using Puyo Puyo Tsu rules or Tetris with Super Rotation System rules attacking with obstructions as they clear Puyo Puyo chains or Tetris lines. If there is at least one Puyo Puyo player and at least one Tetris player every Tetris player will be assigned an attack gauge. Tetris attacks get stored in an attack gauge when the associated Tetris player performs any action that would immediately send penalty lines to opposing players in a multiplayer Tetris game with no Puyo Puyo players e.g. clear multiple lines at once generate a consecutive chain of moves where each move clears one or more lines perform TSpin techniques that clear one or more lines or fully clear the matrix. If a Tetris player either fully clears the matrix or fails to clear a line when the attack gauge is not empty the stored attack will be processed under an offset rule if there are any incoming attacks either enough of the attack the player is sending is sacrificed to nullify the incoming attack and the remainder is sent to the opponents if the Tetris players attack is large enough to completely nullify the incoming attack or the entire attack is sacrificed to weaken the incoming attack. If there is no incoming attack the attack is sent to the opponents. If all players are Tetris players attacks from Tetris players are immediately processed under the offset rule when they are generated instead of being stored in an attack gauge. When a player tops out the player is eliminated. The last player or side standing wins the round.    Answers my question after all. I cant quite tell what the attack rules mean but it seems pretty clear that you can both just play Tetris against each other. Good to know. ,nintendo,dg61dv1,3,t5_2qhnk

Because we got  Link variants bit Ocarina of Time Wind Waker to them it makes sense that they continue this trend and make more Link variants based on other major Zelda games. I think they should have done pack sets from the beginning each focused on a different game. They could have done Skull Kid and Fierce Deity Link for MM Zant and Midna maybe her Twili form since we already have the Wolf Link amiibo for TP and Ghirahim and Fi for SS. For WW I wish they would have replaced the Toon Zelda amiibo with Tetra.,nintendo,dg7kj69,4,t5_2qhnk

PD . protocol. Edit it isnt necessarily inaccurate V  .A is the anticipated power draw with everything on and charging while docked but it is incomplete or an oversimplification. You need PD . USB TypeC charging device with a sufficient power rating at a minimum... and this assumes Nintendo isnt utilizing a proprietary Alternate Mode as supported in the USB TypeC Spec in the UFP on the PCB in the dock to prevent using rd party USB TypeC charging accessories with the dock e.g. as a means of providing a future capability or ensuring full capability of the dock due to the tricky nature of implementing USB TypeCs flexibility ,nintendo,dg85uy7,1,t5_2qhnk

That said I love the Zelda series. Of course I dont mind choices. Nintendo decided at a certain point that they were not going to try and compete with Microsoft and Sony by making a similar console and they instead went the route of trying to making unique gimmicky consoles and aiming for a younger demographic in order to be family oriented. Im assuming in order to appeal to parents with younger children they have to make their hardware cheaper but I dont know if that is true. Either way thats fine and dandy but I have no interest in that.

I also played DK Jungle Climber in this setup though with a bit less success.
