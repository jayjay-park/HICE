145639,0,t3_1vr1fr,Im just wondering if the cyclist was the son of an MP or Police Chief if something more would be done to convict the motorist. If the driver was a drug addict as opposed to a youth worker he might be convicted and sentenced to several years in prison for manslaughter.  The reality is the driver will literally get away with murder because it was not his fault the sun was low on the horizon. Despite all the precautions the cyclist took he was still invisible to a driver who was not paying proper attention. For a helmet to be smashed to pieces the driver certainly wasnt driving slowly because of the low morning sun. He just didnt care and now hell probably just do a couple of hundred hours of community service or take a drivers awareness course,ukbike,cev0pi4,8,t5_2slwv

The bike routes are generally longer than the motor vehicle routes and now have lower priority. The lack of priority is claimed not to be a problem yet its a criticism frequently levelelled at British cycle paths and something I personally find incredibly annoying.I did look up the details for Assen in an attempt to find a British city to compare it to.

2230302,0,t1_cln9tv5,If you find these kind of facilities to be helpful then more power to you and far be it from me anyone else to stand in the way of your enjoyment.But please dont try to give the impression that turning right for instance on a junction like this wouldnt necessitate a much lower average speed given that it introduces at least six additional hazards to be tracked and taken account of and three occasions on which it is necessary to slow to an almost complete stop and observe potential hazards over a  degree arc compared to a conventional junction or roundabout. Or that weaving in behind a bus stop on a .m strip of tarmac between two pedestrian areas then back out again onto a road wouldnt result in most cases in a cyclist similarly having to brake to below ten miles per hour. And this brings us onto the subject of causality when the infrastructure is such that it is not safe to exceed the speed limits inherent in the design few people will exceed the design speed so I would be careful what conclusions you come to depending on the evidence youre looking at. To answer your question a lot of the cycling infrastructure that I have seen coming from places like Holland has a safe average speed of about mph in ideal conditions with some stretches suitable for speeds as mph on occasion but in reality in and amongst other riders and pedestrians of all ages it tends to be unsafe to proceed at much more than  and in many cases less. I would contrast this with many commuters that I know who average near enough  and you will see that for some people at least there is no comparison.,ukbike,clnbotd,1,t5_2slwv

2288661,0,t3_2leae1,Another thread that immediately disintegrates into but what about motorists? Theyre the bad guys!. Anybody want to pick on horse riders and pedestrians as well?If you actually think about the issue at hand whether headphones are either a distraction or an obstruction to hearing other road users be they motorists other cyclists horse riders pedestrians then I think youd have to agree that they are. Yes the same thing applies to these other road users and Im pretty certain that at least some pedestrians have had either an accident or a near miss due to headphones but that is not the issue.Should there be a law to ban headphone use for cyclists? I dont know but I wouldnt mind one being in place to allow me to get past other cyclists who cant hear me calling to them to let me through. Id also like one for the pedestrians who never hear me on the shared path I use regularly  but Id be worried youd get more kids using their phone speaker and blasting their godawful music out loud rather than using headphones. So maybe we shouldnt make it a law but instead make it compulsory for cyclists using headphones to have two mirrors with clear unobstructed visibility of the road behind  the same as motorists who cant rely on hearing to pick up whats behind them.Its a murky area and all Ill say is that I cant understand people who restrict their awareness of the world around them whether by listening to music through headphones not wearing prescription glasses or contact lenses overtinting their vehicles windows not having working mirrors or even just wearing their hood up when its not required.One of the reasons I cycle is to enjoy the scenery and hear the world around me.

3820971,0,t3_346oby,End of the age the car age? No. Are cities around the world are coming to the conclusion they would be better of with fewer cars? Some but few and most are still encouraging and building for increased car usage.Not in the UK not even in London not in Europe and not in the US or China. If we have reached peak car someone needs to tell the Americans    Europeans    China  Shared ownership is apparently something that is against our culture here in the UK  The praise for Birmingham plans is crazy they area joke and do near nothing to encourage active travel. Sustrans DIY Streets programs mentioned in the article do little to remove space or limit the impact of motor traffic. They are all fluff with slashes of coloured paint and lane narrowing with no bike infra provide leaving active travel including walking difficult for all but the brave and able. In some schemes this lane narrowing actually makes cycling less enjoyable as not eveyone is happy to take the lane and deal with the abuse from motorists on the busy roads. Sustrans is not the ally of active travel they are bunch of well meaning people an an organization that has largely failed and continues to fail to support active travel in a safe way that appeals to more then the tiny percentage of the population that already do it. Hell this year the were celebrating the mud tracks that are the NCN claiming some kind of vision had been realized. It nice to dream the car will go away and then all can cycle or public transport but cities amp towns across the UK are not coming to this realization any time soon. Liverpool recent removed almost all its bus lanes and many cities are slashing public transport funding. The few moving in the right direction are inching towards this such that most of us will be long dead before active travel is a seen as a real choice for  of the UKs population.Hackney have activity blocked protected bike routes instead sending cyclists down car parking lined narrow back streets. As part of CSH many areas will even see more parking spaces added.gtgtThe statistic Hackney is proudest of is that more than  of its residents commute to work by bike. Hackney fails to mention its accident rates are still nice and high and it has a very large demographic advantage of young people combined with no high quality by london standards railtube links. Most in Hackney are not choosing cycling as its a great or fun or safe option its just the least bad option vs getting the bus every day. This is why they band about the commute figure not the all trips figure which is lower  and that is not much higher than many other inner broughsI want cycling to be a focus and I want less driving but its not happening at the design stage in the anglosphere we are getting shared space. Pointless crazy paving and paint that makes streets look nice and designer claim make motorists behave better when the evidence does not support that in the long term NL has been using this approach for a while and they are amongst the worst places there to cycle or walkSadly this guy gtgtHolding out against what is rapidly becoming the orthodoxy is Stephen Glaister former professor of transport at Imperial College and about to retire as director of the Royal Automobile Club Foundation Until the  recession broadly speaking there was continued growth in car travel he insists. Then the young age group were very badly hit economically so its not surprising their takeup of driving licences is falling. To what extent thats also to do with some fundamental change in attitudes remains to be seen. Lets see what happens when they get to  and have a family.Is likely right nothing has changed th terms of safe cycling provision better pavements and walking routes and improved public transport in the majority of the UKs or worlds cities during the recession that leads me to think we are on the cusp of a sustained change.After all even London who apparently is green and leading the way for cycling in the UK  some other guardian writers have claimedIs widening roads adding new road upgrading road capacity and aiming to reduce delays for motorists etc etcAnd its spending  time more on that which excludes raft of stuff than it is on providing its cycling network. ,ukbike,cqrtm35,2,t5_2slwv

5500060,0,t1_cwel146,In response to your first point its a fair question and honestly not one I can answer. If theres nobody crossing at a red light and nobody who may be about to start crossing then the type of vehicle passing through it is moot. I guess that due to their lower speed smaller size reduced weight and increased manoeuvrability bicycles have more chances to go through a red light even when people are crossing without presenting a hazard. However I dont think this is a compelling enough reason to legalise it exclusively for cyclists. Making this sort of red light into a Give Way to Pedestrians sign would essentially make them into zebra crossings. Zebra crossings are useful but on roads that have a high volume of traffic and a high number of people wanting to cross this can quickly lead to traffic jams due to there being no break in the flow of pedestrians. Regarding your second paragraph a huge amount of the ire that red light jumpers draw stems from the fact that it is illegal. Cyclists doing it are breaking the law and it is right that this should be looked down on the same way speeding drink driving and red light jumping by motorists should be opposed.If it was made legal then what would their issue be? I dont believe cyclists should receive special treatment. I do believe that they should be treated differently to motor traffic. In many ways they already are  speed limits dont apply to bicycles nor do the same drinkdrive laws. There are laws that specifically apply only to cyclists and some that specifically do not.Ive only ridden once on closed roads LondonSurrey  but the way the  cyclists that day moved was nothing like the way cars move on a motorway. If you look at the infrastructure that they have in places like the Netherlands junctions for cyclists are very different to those for cars. So I really do think that having distinct laws to govern the behaviour of distinct methods of transport is required.Whether the two groups should occupy the same space whilst being subject to different laws however is the real question.,ukbike,cweonj9,3,t5_2slwv

It wont catch on without good segregation of cars and bikes.

6458933,0,t1_czmvuoj,Unfortunately the law doesnt work that way. If you write an offence into statute you have to include the range of penalties for committing that offence. You cant just say If you commit this offence the penalty is dependant on the reason for our asking. Usually the penalty for a failure to provide offence is set to be at least as serious as the most common underlying offence. For failing to provide a breath specimen for example the range of penalties is the same but failure to provide will usually err towards the higher end of the scale on the basis of How pissed must you have been that failing to provide was the better option?Since s. is primarily used for speeding offences the penalty is  points and a fine of up to  with discretion to award a driving ban on top. Thats enough to make it a bad choice for speeding and most careless driving offences but it could be worth the risk in a dangerous driving case. Note that you wont find out what the charge is until youve nominated the driver but when there has been a collision and youve left the scene dangerous driving seems a reasonable assumption to make. Dangerous driving carries  points a mandatory ban a fine of up to  and a prison sentence of up to  months. You could understand the driver deciding that the better option is not to name the driver if only to remove the possibility of a prison sentence. You could even understand their spouse going along with it on the grounds that  points each and  fine each even if they both get banned is better than a potential prison sentence. What surprises me is that both drivers werent convicted of s.. The article says The female doesnt appear to have been convicted which makes sense  she would only be lawfully required to reply if she was the driver.  thats not right. Anybody who receives an s. is required to respond to it and its absurd to suggest that between two possible drivers neither of them can remember hitting a cyclist and driving off. The court doesnt usually take kindly to people trying to play the system so I would have expected to see a conviction for both possible drivers with fines at the higher end of the scale. Depending on whether the drivers named each other or simply didnt name anybody there may also be some prospect of a conviction for perverting the course of justice.  ,ukbike,czneapt,3,t5_2slwv

8646274,0,t3_4yb14o,If you can fit a pannier rack Id go for that instead of a rucksack. It helps avoid back ache and sweat. Id also get mudguards unless you plan to avoid the rain. Get decent lights too.The embankment is a pretty decent place to ride but it doesnt make much sense for your route Id just go for the Hyde Park option.,ukbike,d6me91i,4,t5_2slwv
8807701,0,t3_50ob1i,A  London roundabout that incorporates some elements of the design and I think was built after the TRL tests is Queens Roundabout in Battersea. Cyclegaz takes a spin round it on his YouTube channel.However there is signal control where foot and cycle ways cross the exits so it seems the builders like some commenters here also felt that London drivers at least couldnt be trusted. Probably with good reason. The upshot is that waiting times appear fairly long for bikes but if it encourages more to cycle as a result of the enhanced safety its all to the good IMO.  One fine day you might get the etiquette you see on the Purmerend roundabout linked by unogdam but for the time being  signal control is probably necessary.,ukbike,d76kdpg,1,t5_2slwv

9857925,1,t3_5ghdfr,Im not happy about this at all. Especially not for careless driving. The legal definition of careless driving is so wooly that you could see someone being sent down for  years for not doing a shoulder check. The outcome of a driving death is horrific. Especially for the family of the victim but often also for the driver who has to live with the death they caused. Weve all had that lapse in concentration whether on two wheels or four. The fuck where did he come from moment if youve never experienced that then youre incredibly fortunate. For those that it does happen to  the vast majority of the time nothing bad comes of it. So much of this push for harsher punishments feels vindictive. Nothing can bring people back from the dead. In my view this should be strictly limited to dangerous driving. There has to be an element of a person knowingly driving in a manner that could cause death or injury to others. ,ukbike,dasie9w,0,t5_2slwv
