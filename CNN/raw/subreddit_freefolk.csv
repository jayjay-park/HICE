Stannis and his kings fucking justice could use a big kick in the ass  if there werent such a large stick planted there blocking the way. Davoss continued loyal service does not serve to make Stannis more humane or temper his uncompromising nature but reinforces his cruel and severe ways as just and forthright.  Only this last episode with his daughter do we see something besides singlemindedness mixed with bloody ambition in Stannis and that surely isnt derived from any influence from Davos  a guy whos loyalty was unwavering despite losing his son fighting for Stannis.But yeah Id heed any warning he gave me thats for sure.

4014498,0,t1_crdes63,I actually dont think he feels too strongly one way or the other honestly. That is why he responded this way. He wrote ASOIAF the way he did in the first place for the purpose of being able to create a story that isnt pressured by tv conventions and requirements. He wanted to create a series where he could have tons of characters with tons of shit happening over a long period of time that wasnt concerned with how it would have to play out on screen. He has commented on this before that a main reason he likes the books is that he can do it so differently than if he was writing a tv show.This is why he doesnt really care about the direction the show takes. He understands that it has to be different. It is out of his hands. He knows better than probably anyone that there will be necessary disappointments in order to make a functional show. Its why he did the series as books in the first place.Im sure he can think of ways that he could have done things better in the show I mean he is one of the best. He also has even acknowledged characters and scenes that he thinks were better in the show. Either way the point is that he doesnt really care much because it doesnt affect him or his original vision of the books. Differences are necessary. Some are great like the reveal of reekramsay boltonmuch better in the show. Some are bad Dorne bullshit.People need to fixate less on things they dislike. Appreciate the show for what it is. Its really not that bad overall. Take a page from Georges book and realize that they are different but still valuable in their own ways. Be happy there even is a show. Personally I feel like my enjoyment of both the books and the show are enriched by the existence of the other because I can see a different vision of each event and develop a greater understanding of the core of the story and its elements.,freefolk,crdvt7e,1,t5_37tpy

4112760,0,t3_37qx77,You know assuming that next season will be packed full of events is pretty safe but we dont really know to what extent as we have no access to the main source material TWOW.For what concerns those plots I think the Kingsmoot could be dealt with in one episode or two and then the focus would switch on Euron without spending too much time on Victarion if at all present Damphair and so on. I really like Victarion but his material might not have a huge impact on the endgame so it could be easily streamlined. Damphair well... is Damphair. More of a narrator than a player and I wouldnt mind seeing his material cut as I found it a bit boring at times.See from what we know from GRRM interviews in TWOW Tyrion and Daenerys are not meant to meet for a large part of the book so we can safely assume that part of Danys story will be stramlined as it happened with the Mereenese knot not a bad thing either if you asked me. I wasnt looking forward to countless Council Meetings with dozens of SomethingzoSomething. I would count the battle of fire out as it would be quite expensive to portray as theres the battle of Winterfell happening which is probably more eventful. Im also assuming that in the books thats when Barristan dies and hes already gone probably for this reason.So yeah theres plenty of material but thats pretty normal. Theres the Tarlys but we dont know how big their role is and what it is. They could be in just one or two episodes for what we know on Sams way to the south apart from Randyll who might have a recurring role that involves other main characters such as Euron or the Tyrells.Of course with only seven seasons confirmed   hours plus  if they decide to split Season  in two  things are bound to get rushed which is one of the reasons I am not complaining about some changes like Sansa not babysitting Robin for months and the shortened Mereen storyline or the cut of characters like Quentyn or even JonCon and Aegon if they turn out to be a red herring. Time is tight so it makes sense for me keeping only those characters who really count even though it can make some people unhappy.,freefolk,crp2w6v,14,t5_37tpy

So undoubtedly theyll all be happening. The only thing about the Jon thing is he has been in a weird like dying position a few times After the WW hit him down and the arrows he took from red.

4289078,0,t1_cs8pvkm,I disagree. GRRM has always had that grounded realism in his storytelling. Jon did a bunch of stuff eventually became Lord Commander. In the process and as a result of his choices he pissed people off. Those people decided he wasnt fit to lead and fitting with the behavior of the period Planetos is set in they mutinied and killed him.Disappointing yes because where can the story go from there with such an important character dead? But in real life some people are that bitter and shortsighted. And in real life that bitter shortsightedness has consequences. The Nights Watch fucking everything up with Jon dying in the process may very well be GRRMs plan.

4495620,0,t1_csxax9w,I agree that Brans chapters are more enjoyable on a reread because you can look for hints as to whats coming in the future. Im pretty sure that the dream cant be just good dreamwriting because its not a mere dream its sent by Bloodraven who is basically initiating Brans training to become his successor. As such Im convinced he will be a major player and manipulate things big time but like you Im not sure if there even is a classic hero to this story.I really like your interpretation that the three shadows are just examples of all the dangers around Brans family. It makes a lot more sense than trying to link them to imminent threats for them.Regarding Asshai I found the following quote from  on So Spake Martin I know we dont kneel to Lindaaa but its a helpful site nonethelessgt Will we see Asshai?gt Only in flashback and memory if at all.SourceSo it seems that if we ever get to see Asshai through Bran is the most likely option. Remember however that we have to take most things GRRM says with a grain of salt because that was years ago and he might change his mind anyway.The passage about the Land of Always Winter struck me as odd as well. I didnt remember that Bran had even looked beyond that curtain of light at the end of the world. Its a fascinating line which is so easy to miss.Edit formatting,freefolk,csxbweu,2,t5_37tpy

4582153,0,t3_3drn83,The real WarTo me Jons story is the real story with everyone doing a very in depth training montage. The reasoning goes very in line with what Varamyr said this is the true war that matters. This may have accounted for some hype.Plot holesThe plot hole with the Ice Storm is gaping when considered on its own. However the Wall has been riddled with plot holes as of late. Lets not ask the close Northern clans or families to help us fight the Wildlings nor rescue the local villagers nor have any Rangers scout for Mance nor anything.. One vote for the win. Sam can keep his girlfriend. . I almost forgot the Why didnt the White Walker not respond to Sam?.. Not to mention after Hardhome lets not sail South of the Wall by Jon amp Lets let the Wildlings in the kill the only Crow they currently respect! by AlliserAfter these the Palisade seems reasonable. Its a shame as I liked how it gave the Thenn the Do what must be done personality later backed up when he joined Jon to get the Obsidian. Also  seems similar to Jon not just getting stabbed initially while hes digging for obsidian. That said I soon forget it because the White Walker halfswords can we call it that when the hilt is as long as the blade? Jon where it seems to naturally fit and as you said it heavily affects Jon.Raising the DeadAllow me to quote Melisandre if you willgt the more effortless the sorcery appears the more men fear the sorcerer.The brilliance behind this scene isnt that we see them do what we already knew that they could do the brilliance is that he has done it so easily and on such a massive scale. Add in the added edge of the Were coming for you! presence and it means a lot more.CharactersLike I mentioned earlier the Thenn was built into Whatever it takes personality built up and the pride. This makes it more impactful when he allies with Jon when the White Walkers come.And Karsi. Gods she gets little more the  lines and we see how fearful she is of this threat thanks to Fuck em theyre dead.These characters were built up so quickly and left such hugely positive impacts. Are you watching Sand Snakes?Dorne and other plotlinesWhat competition did Hardhome really have this season? Dorne... Moving on. Meereen at least the Harpies had presence...? Stannis... Good actors but Stannis suffers to keep building St. Dany. Then along comes Hardhome. Finally something good. Books vs ShowWe didnt expect it because it didnt happen in the books. It worked equally well for Yara and for Dorne. Then BAM! The action the nods to the lore VS  DS the fear for characters Ed survived! the cool new characters all at once. This was needed. If were leaving book territory this was needed.FYI  My favourite scenes were. Sansas marriage because of how it made me more feel for Jeyne Poole than the books did despite Jeyne getting treated much much worse. Too controversial for others though. Plus its double edged for how much Sansa didnt act like LFs protg.. The Walk of Shame. Ok this would win best scene. The reason the episode suffers... Dorne. Fuck that Thurman Batman plotline. Oh and St. Danys Find this ring! plot setup. That said Hardhome had the The Wheel speech.,freefolk,ct86l2f,5,t5_37tpy

He did take after Ned in a lot of ways and that would have stood him in good stead. I also like that he stepped up willingly to help out when Catelyn couldnt deal with what Maester Lewin was bringing to her. He was still basically a kid and he was stepping into his responsibility when he saw the need.Another thing that struck me again in this chapter is the protectiveness of the dire wolves over their children. They have a sense when their people are in trouble and protect them. Bran would have died here if not for Summer. Which leads my thoughts to... Where was Ghost when Jon was being stabbed?

For instance if an undercover cop is posing as a prostitute it doesnt matter that you didnt actually hire a prostitute what matters is that you had every intent to hire a prostitute. Another example paid informant sets up a bogus drug deal. It doesnt matter that you never actually bought the drugs what matters is that you had every intent to.The same logic applies here. It doesnt matter if you didnt actually download copyrighted content what matters is that you had mens rea the mental state to download the copyrighted content and thus it could still be prosecuted.Is it right?

The Bolton practice of mutilating captives is not only seen as a depraved and unsavory act it was actually outlawed.  Would the North really cheer as a woman and a child are mutilated and burned alive like that? No. They might cheer though if they thought the act was just. As in somebody who lived by the proverbial sword dies by the sword.  Seems like a fitting end for Ramsay. Beyond that they are set ablaze. Botlons dont set crosses ablaze. Melisandre does though. On the other hand that would make too much sense and this is the show that gave us The Sand Snake plot and subsequent bailout.

7633797,0,t1_d39huwa,I just read up on the the battle of Qohor. You are right they do have bows. Cant find anything about them being the best bows in the world though. Saying that it seems they prefer to use the sword to the bow or whip their other traditional weapon. The battle of Qohor highlights one thing in particular  dothraki screamers are no match for a  man spearwall. The dothraki importance on individual glory adversely effects their capability as a cohesive army unit. As such they are susceptible to basic military tactics. Ask yes they do have archers and while they may help greatly in the south the south has something that are even more devastating to the dothraki. Heavily armoured knights and lots of them. Dothraki curved swords bounce off armour. Arrows cannot penetrate thick steel. Whips... Are all bit useless against anyone clothed anyway. Bluntly speaking the heavily armoured and horsed knights of the vale would wreck the shit out of the dothraki. As for the North much mention has been made of Manderlys heavy horse. They would cause the unarmored screamers much trouble. Regardless of which as winter is coming it is likely to snow reducing range effectiveness so the dothraki archers who are also unarmoured in the snow would need to get a lot closer. Easily within crossbow range. The advantage of battlements and the higher ground makes the defenders much harder to hit while also making it easier for the defenders to fire upon the incoming hordes. It would also seem the dothrakis handed diminish even more if there is a regiment of spears holding the line while archers are free to pick them apart.So yes while they do have archers which afford then a slight chance of harming the enemy the dothraki lack of military tactic cohesive units armour and climate familiarity would all but spell the end for the dothraki campaign. Also it turns out that  heavily armoured knights would be able to annihilate  half naked light cavalryshock troopers in the snow. Armour is a much greater factor in this combat than it is being credited I feel.,freefolk,d39x5yq,0,t5_37tpy

For some reason the idea he knew about his death and continued to wait for brans birth and accident and following him relentlessly is a lot more heartbreaking than if the time paradox caused the younger Hodor to experience the moment and was just broken as a result and he became himself again at the final moments of his life.Thoughts?,freefolk,d3hfh9r,2,t5_37tpy

7828129,1,t1_d3vxhsg,I agree with your stance on Davoss part but most other characters aside from Edd............. are pretty consistent. Yes part of Dornes plot was very... stiff and linear but still OK. In other episodes however I cant say the same. My point is episode  was the most consistent overall. It felt super short but a complete consistent and harmonious package. I can not say the same for the other episodes  They are super messy.Youre not giving season  enough credit. Jons plot was fine and had some genuinely great scenes. Talisa was also pretty good her scenes didnt feel forced although you kind of knew they were. Danys plot was the weakest but it still had some great scenes. Kings Landing was great Nights watch was great Arya was great Catelyn and Jaime were great Bran was great Theon was fucking awesome.... How are good scenes the exception rather than the rule? They were the rule. The problem was abbreviations of plots and weak management of scenes which made for an overall weaker package than the tight seasons  and  but the scenes themselves were still great. The braavosi play was an awful generic scene same thing for Eurons introduction. I agree with Hold the Door being a good scene as was Mels reveal as was part of the hanging in the NW and some tommen and High Sparrow scenes BUT THESE ARE THE EXCEPTION. The rule is generic linear scenes plot driven and badly written. What season  does bad it does worse than ever in the entire series and it doesnt do enough good scenes to compensate.,freefolk,d3vy5jf,0,t5_37tpy

7834072,0,t3_4mju0a,It is weird I actually feel like a lot of the changes have been positive but in weird ways. For instance Barristan being killed in season  allowed for better material for Tyrion in that season. Sansas changes in season  have given her a really strong arc this season. Stannis streamlined storyline let us really get to the point of what we wanted to see the Starks take back the North. While a lot of these changes didnt make sense in the moment they happened and have left a bad taste in peoples mouth I feel like they were done for very specific reasons and not done without care.Now for actual changes I genuinely dont give a shit about. Some of the line changes are just outright stupid to complain about. The Your Sister vs Only Cat is just evidence of how dumb and nitpicky the fanbase can be and honestly why the writers have no regard for you. Other shit like The Lannisters send their regards vs Jaime Lannister sends his regards was another one that fans bitched about to no end Why would she ever want revenge on Jaime if he didnt specifically say Jaime Jesus fucking kill youself if you said this kind of shit. I also dont care about the changes to the TER. In the show he is definitely supposed to be someone else than Bloodraven. In the books this is cool because it links stuff to the Dunk and Egg stuff but without that it doesnt really matter. I also dont mind other changes like Egg is actually Aerys father in the show and not grandfather IIRC. Other familial stuff like that. ,freefolk,d3wm8s8,1,t5_37tpy

Why do I think she was hallucinating?. Weve seen Jaqen cutting a face off just one episode ago. Season  made a big deal about Arya wanting to find out what happens to the bodies after they wash them. There would literally be no need for this entire ceremony if any faceless man can just take any face from any person at any time.. Arya saw Jaqen kill himself then the Waif turned into Jaqen while dead Jaqen was still wearing his Jaqen face wich would mean that there are two of Jaqens faces. Not a chance.. Despite Jaqen killing himself and the Waif turning into another Jaqen both Jaqen and the Waif are alive and well in Season .,freefolk,d3xyfia,1,t5_37tpy

But the lack of a grounded reasonable voice among liberals is really hurting them. I mean the sjw and PC culture is now the face of american liberalism to middle America. These SJW types fail to see that Trump is purely in response to their agenda. They asked for too much and Americans are saying fuck no. Whenever they say shit like giveCaptainAmericaABoyfried or shit like lavishing that Clock Kid with attention and gifts where any reasonable person knows he was just trying to stir up trouble they are just pushing more people to vote for Trump. Say this to any most any redditor and you will get rejected but that is the truth I have seen from even the most reluctant Trump supporters.Then we have Europe and how they are bending over just to take it from an invading population.

First off the North has nearly been bled dry in terms of troops as evidenced in the most recent seasons as battles consist of armies numbering only a couple thousand instead the tens of thousands that marched off to war in season . Meanwhile the armies of the Vale have been untouched by the ravages of war meaning they dont have to contribute their full might to turn the tide of any battle there.Secondly and more importantly the Vale could not leave its territory as defenseless as Robb Stark left the North during his campaign. The Vale still has to protect itself from the Hill Tribes now armed with Lannister steel who are capable of devastating the countryside in the absence of the Vales knights. It would make little sense for Littlefinger to commit all of his troops to the North and leave all the wealth industry and agriculture of the Vale defenseless and open to attack.,freefolk,d42vls2,2,t5_37tpy

7944862,0,t1_d48kz68,I dont really see it because there are just as many Arya x Jon moments if not more. And Arya is always compared to Ygritte and Lyanna.Arya glanced behind her saw Jon and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck. I was afraid you were gone she said her breath catching in her throat. They wouldnt let me out to say goodbye.Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of sudden terror the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her the very first.She could find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident and together theyd return to Winterfell or run to Jon on the Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldnt feel so alone.Arya ran to him for a last hug. Put down the sword first Jon warned her laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses.The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.Arya never seemed to fit no more than he hadyet she could always make Jon smile.Arya he missed her even more than Robb skinny little thing that she was all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes so fierce and willful.He would give anything to be with her now to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face to hear her finish a sentence with him.Something about her made him think of Arya though they looked nothing at all alike. About Ygritte She would have given anything if Jon had been here to call her little sister and muss her hair.Ygritte reminded him a little of his sister Arya though Arya was younger and probably skinnier.Jon will want me even if no one else does.If you kill a man and never meant hes just as dead Ygritte said stubbornly. Jon had never met anyone so stubborn except maybe for his little sister Arya.Needle was Jon Snows smile. He used to mess my hair and call me little sister she remembered and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.Needle. He wondered if she still had it.Arya missed Jon most of all. Just saying his name made her sad.Hes to marry Arya Stark. My little sister. Jon could almost see her in that moment longfaced and gawky all knobby knees and sharp elbows with her dirty face and tangled hair. They would wash the one and comb the other he did not doubt but he could not imagine Arya in a wedding gown nor Ramsay Boltons bed.Ah Arya. You have a wildness in you child. The wolf blood my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it and my brother Brandon more than a touch. It brought them both to an early grave. Arya heard sadness in his voice he did not often speak of his father or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. Lyanna might have carried a sword if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.Arya was breathing hard herself then. She knew the fight was done. You ride like a northman milady Harwin said when hed drawn them to a halt. Your aunt was the same. Lady Lyanna.,freefolk,d492rxe,0,t5_37tpy

This is free folk!  But yes theres evidence in the books that Jaime is actually Azor Ahai other than the Ragnarok theory.  Thing is weve got a test.  We know how lightbearer was forged  plunged flaming into Nissa Nissas breasts.

8008909,0,t1_d4g9c42,Knowing the Knights of the Vale were coming may have changed their entire strategy including the timing of the attack. Jon didnt listen to Sansa and made the mistake of breaking off from his army and attacking on his own after being goaded by Ramsays ploy with Rickon but it can also be argued that Sansas deceit also cost the lives of hundreds if not a couple thousand of Jons army. I suppose this was DampDs intended consequence of Sansa not trusting Jon and the two of them not being close. Agreed also if Ramsay knows the Vale is with Jon then he probably doesnt bring his army out or at least changes tactics. BTW between Ramsays strategy against Jon and how he disposed of Stannis through six seasons it can be easily argued that Ramsay was the best military strategist on the show. ,freefolk,d4g9yug,2,t5_37tpy

8097531,0,t3_4q0ynm,Posted this earlier on another thread.  Jons real name could be Jaehaerys after Jaehaerys I.    Jaehaerys I was a dragonrider and Rhaegar believed the dragon must have three heads. Rhaegars two other children Aegon and Rhaenys were named after Targ dragonriders.    Jaehaerys I was a great King and would have been someone Rhaegar admired. He was a scholar and warrior and his rule was long and peaceful. He united the Kingdom and was well loved by his people.    Rhaegar had a younger brother named Jaehaerys who died when Rhaegar was young. He could be honoring his brother by naming his son after him.  There is also some interesting crossover between Jon and Jaehaerys I.   Jon facilitating peace with the Wildlings is reminiscent of Jaehaerys I negotiating peace with the Faith Militant.   Davos when doubting if he could be Hand is told of Septon Barth who was commonborn and rose to be Hand of the King for Jaehaerys . Davos who was commonborn will likely be Hand of the King for Jon Snow.   Jaehaerys I his sisterwife Alysanne and their dragons traveled to the North Winterfell and The Wall. He also helped to grow the Nights Watch and add to the Wall.   If Jon were to start listening and partnering with Sansa or Daenerys then there might parallel to Jaehaerys and Alysanne. GRRM stated that Alysanne was the most trusted counsellor and right hand to Jaehaerys I. Maybe not the sisterwife part though.,freefolk,d4q8hfc,7,t5_37tpy

I was really disappointed as I was trying to watch the show along with the freefolk IRC and the one time I was able to make that happen the legit service fucked me while everyones pirated streams were working fine.I didnt lose too much sleep over it since I had been borrowing someone elses HBONow account until they let it lapse then I signed up for one for the last  episodes and canceled it before i had to pay anything.

Best major female character  Cersei Best recurring male character  Mace Tyrell because he was so magnificent in that feather helmet.Best recurring female character  I wanted to pick Olenna for her Sand Snake smackdown but felt the vote had to go to Meera Reed.Best new character  LYANNA MORMONTBest episode  Hold the DoorBest heroheroine  Jon SnowBest villainvillainess  tough one but I picked Ramsay Bolton for Iwans performance.Best duo  Sansa and Theon loved their chemistry.Best fight scene  another tough one but ultimately went with the ToJ sequence because I felt Arthur Dayne deserved that much. Best death  Balon Greyjoy because falling off that slippery bridge with those howling screams was pretty damn awesome. Most emotional moment  wanted to pick Promise me Ned but went with Hold the Door.Best WTF moment  Sand Snakes killing DoranTrystane pretty much.Worst character of season   Olly.

Its about the drug trade in Baltimore through the eyes of the kids who sell drugs to the suppliers to the police. Season  was sorta slow and I wont spoil it but I personally though the whole Season  plot was fucking poetry.Mr Robot is cool. rmrrobot  season  has just started so you can catch up if you dont watch it and post in the discussions.Breaking Bad  Better call saul. I watched it  years ago whilst it aired but I didnt watch Better Call Saul for no good reason at all. Im going to watch them both thats around  seasons.Power is a good watch I dont think there is a subreddit for it though. You might not like it but Im interested in gangs the drug trade and what not. Its about a night club owner who uses his club to launder drug money. If you like rap culture too  cent makes a appearance its pretty cool.The  sorta corny and aimed at teenagers but its pretty decent. I liked the whole space plot but I didnt like a certain plot of the recent season.Im not a fan but you might be try the Walking Dead and Fear the Walking dead.I havent seen them yet but Ive been meaning to watch a couple other shows Ive heard so much about Peaky Blinders Arrow Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D Preacher Vikings The Last Ship and Jericho. See I was gunna start Firefly and I watched a bit of Jericho but they both got cancelled prematurely. As did Hannibal and Ive heard they were all great i enjoyed jericho but even My name is Earl pissed me off when it got canceleld on a cliff hanger so Im not gunna start those shows but you could if you dont care.

Also the history is written by the winners or at least in this case history is written by the side that has writing or the side that was around to tell the story.  Supposedly the children left to live in the woods the others left to go to the north pole men were the only ones left. Also about azor ahai I can picture those guys from Comedy Centrals Drunk History telling the history of Azor Ahai he was a drunk angry blacksmith who got fed up with his wifes constant nagging so he stabbed her.  He passed out and when he woke up after his drunken escapade he realized he made something pretty important. He then sold the recipe and bought whores and alcohol. ANGUY IS AZOR AHAI REBORN Tldr. Arya is a fooking legend and sansa will totally seduce and beat little finger at his own game ,freefolk,d5wrc8d,2,t5_37tpy

8863610,0,t1_d7d9pc4,No why? Im just saying that there is more uncertainty in going to the Wall in the hopes of finding Jon  he could be beyond the wall ranging he could be dead and she doesnt know what the Nights Watch would do with her for all she knows they could hand her over to the crown. Now that Jon is King it means that hes definitely at Winterfell and has the power to protect her. Anyway youre basing your idea that Arya doesnt want to go home or reunite with Jon on the fact that she went to Braavos but as I said George just needed to put her somewhere to grow up and re arrange things in Westeros before she comes back. Again its not obvious at all that she doesnt want to go home and that shes going to KL to kill Cersei even if she did want to kill Cersei it makes more sense to go to KL first and then head North and stop at the Twins on the way she was last seen at the Twins close to the Northern border and she said that shes going home so it makes more sense that shes going to Winterfell.

9296152,0,t1_d8u4bk8,Yes these leaks dont match the actors reactions and they are strangely lopsided. I mean theyre mostly about Jon and Dany and everyone else sits around doing nothing. Then there are inconsistencies such as Arya arrives in episode  at Winterfell and spars with Brienne which is already bizarre but ok but we know that Brienne and Davos will meet Daenerys in the dragon pit and the leaker says that Jon never sees Arya so why and when does Brienne suddenly decide to join them in Kings Landing? And we know that Ed is filming with Bran yet the leaks say he goes to Winterfell and just stays there. And for some weird reason Tormund is in charge of Eastwatch and has Thoros Beric and the Hound in a dungeon? Why did they go there?  And why does Jon think of taking these prisoners north with him? And the whole purpose of the seasons strange. All this effort just so they can ally with Cersei? Half of Danys allies is with her because they hate the Lannisters. And Cersei is not popular. She blew up half the city and has no claim to the throne why ally with her and not just remove her from power? Also no mention of Varys and Littlefingers story is absurd. Why set Arya against Sansa? He doesnt know Arya what is there to achieve? And Jons name is Aegon? Like his brother? Would they change that from the books? And why did Rhaegar have his marriage annulled? And he married Lyanna?

The mixing process to get from that light of blond to Tully red is very complicated mixing process but not something GOT couldnt achieve as I am sure they get only the best. That being said if she does not have a lot of scenes going wig is exponentially easier and cheaper considering going from light blonde to dark red is a pain in the ass and my least favorite thing I have ever had to do on a head of hair. Edit Her hair from pre season looked pretty stiff and bleachy...which means she may be in repair mode...but there are things on the market that make bleaching hair not damaging AT ALL and are well within her financial means. But even if it were bleachy that means the follicles on the hair strands were lifted high on the strand which means color will not stay on there long at all.

9373687,0,t1_d945rrk,Too much to list but a few things Bad Pussies Wasting so much time on the Stannis arc season  when they just pretty much threw it all out the window with that shitty conclusion The focus on the civilians armed with daggers destroying the supposedly elite soldiers with cut off dicks which also got a stupid conclusion and was just done to give the Barbie Dragon Whore something to do. Waste of time. The need to have Barbie go back to the Dothraki storyline wise just to come back with a slightly bigger army and somehow now be able to wipe out the dagger wieldig civilians as well as using her dragons. This was unnecessary. As awesome as Arya is as a character they completely botched the TV version of her storyline in Braavos and this was also a waste of time.,freefolk,d946jcs,2,t5_37tpy

If Jon wants to abdicate so he can sleep with his auntie as we all do then he should do that but leave the entire North out of it.  The North has suffered way too much to submit to the authority of a southern monarch again.  The Starks werent the only ones who lost people at the RW all the other Northern lords did as well. Lyanna Mormont is Lady of Bear Island because her mother died.  It really belittles the sacrifice of everyone for the Starks if this happens. ,freefolk,d947t6x,1,t5_37tpy

He does not get a say as equal.  Anything he does or says is dependent on his wifey.  He is essentially a boytoy for Dany.  This is why a smart politician which Jon is apparently not would never kneel especially if Dany did not demand it.  A smart politician would negotiate a good deal for his people.And I am Team North not Team Jon.  The North deserves independence after all that happened to it.  Ned Stark was executed in the South for being a moral but stupid person.  Jon was proclaimed King and is expected to keep the Norths independence.  If Jon screws with that to submissively bow to some foreign king I hope that the North opposes him.  I hope that Sansa screws him over.

I think Jon is one of those people who saw Arya and realized that she was different. In this world we see that women are supposed to be very proper in their dresses and theyre supposed to be beautiful and marry rich men and become wives of Lords. Their only real purpose is to give their husbands children and its the men who go off and do the noble thing and fight but Arya isnt like that. She even says that shes not that type of woman so by giving her the Needle before he leaves her  and he knows that he wont see her for a while  it was kind of like him saying I understand you. I understand that youre an outcast like me that youre not what people expect you to be so go and fight. He shares that quality with his father who then notices that she has this sword and gets her trained to use it  Its infuriating this series when you see these bonds being made and then theyre taken away from you like with Jon and Arya. But I think that makes it all the more exciting if they finally do reunite again. gt Kit Harington for Huffington post,freefolk,dcwv0yw,31,t5_37tpy

10591980,0,t1_dd8fdx9,Well did they know how Aryas storyline ends when they shot that scene in S? Nope. So like Daniel yourself and many others reading that piece of dialogue between Arya amp Ned makes very little sense without hindsight and the knowledge of the ending. George warned his friend Daniel who actually listened to him. DampD dont give a damn unfortunately. That last bit about Arya saying it wasnt her but Sansa is very specific misdirection that George has used before. Jon in particular. The two also have unusally similar nightmares of two ruling Castles Winterfell Kings Landing Jon see a girl that was meant to be Arya he sees her smile and thinks of Arya while imagining a crown made of snow on her head. I mean the amount of foreshadowing George has put into Arya and her future is there for people to find and will make so much more sense in hindsight once the series is ended. Also the obvious point of George giving the Stark kids a future they never anticipated or ever wanted is exactly what is happening. Sansa started the series dreaming of becoming Queen and taunted Arya with the idea that she would be forced to bow to her. lol That aint happening. Georges irony will have things turn out very differently and neither Stark girl is ready for it.Also I agree the dialogue is very intriguing. I further broke it down in a different post as seen here That particular part of the conversation between AryaNed had a similar air to that scene between CerseiMaggy. CERSEI amp MAGGY THE FROGgtThree questions may you ask Maggy the Frog said once shed had her drink. You will not like my answers. Ask or begone with you.gtGo the dreaming queen thought hold your tongue and flee. But the girl did not have sense enough to be afraid.gtWhen will I wed the prince? she asked.gtNever. You will wed the king.gtBeneath her golden curls the girls face wrinkled up in puzzlement. Cersei A Feast for CrowsIts Arya that asks  questionsgtArya cocked her head to one side. Can I be a kings councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?gtYou Ned said kissing her lightly on the brow will marry a king and rule his castle and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a High Septon.gtArya screwed up her face. Eddard A Game of ThronesBoth girls first reactions were confusion and they misinterpreted what they were told. Cersei is in love with the idea of marrying Rhaegar she draws pictures of herself riding a dragon with Rhaegar lol but she was wrong. Just like Aryas initial reaction is wrong and she has literally no idea what awaits her. Ned answers each of Aryas questions in an odd way as wellARYA Can I be a kings Councillor?NED You will marry a King. A Queen can be a Kings Counsellor  case in point Alysanne Targaryen who married her brother King Jaehaerys and was his most valued Councillor.ARYA Can I build castles?NED You will rule his castle. As a Queen would.  Alysanne even helped build castles in her time. Queensgate was named in her honor.ARYA Can I become the High Septon?NED Your sons will be knights and princes and lords and yes perhaps even a High Septon.  Queen Alysanne had many children one of whom a girl became a Septa. Another daughter was promised to the Faith as well but she ran away across the narrow sea.  Both Cersei and Arya didnt get it. But fate has a funny way of happening. We shall see!Side noteMany more parallels with Arya amp Alysanne. I particularly like their ideas on the role of women in Westeros. Alysanne was a keen hunterhorserider and once even  flew to the Wall on her dragon when she was bored. lol  gtA queen stayed there for a night. Old Nan had told him the story but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of it. Alysanne the wife of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator  The king had matters to discuss with his Warden of the North and Alysanne grew bored so she mounted her dragon Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall.

In the show theres really no triangle since Jon is fighting to rescue Rickon instead of Arya in the books and he wants to unify the North against the Others whereas in the books his choice is purely emotional not tactical. None of the northern lords rally for Sansa as they do to rescue Arya in the books and Ramsay has an obvious upper hand which he doesnt in the books. The show basically kept the main point for what we know which is Jon becomes king but went about it a completely different way. In the books hell probably become king because of Robbs will Stannis will probably have some sort of hand in the whole situation and Sansa wont be involved at all. ,freefolk,ddbrkqe,5,t5_37tpy

10820021,0,t1_ddvk3xr,I thought I would come back and respond to you more appropriately since I have a bad habit of being dismissive.   The reason I reject continental philosophy is not simply because I am from the analytical tradition but because it does not change the way I think. It may introduce new ideas however ideas come from everywhere and there are far more exciting ones in other disciplines.   My interest is in examining how we think and conceptual shifts might be due to a fear we may be cognitively closed to solving some problems.  I am aware that this is what Heidegger was trying to do with his phenomenology and there is a renewed interest in that area because of ideas in embedded embodied cognition however I simply find little value in his work not saying that others will not find value. Presently I am overwhelmed with information and I will filter out as much as I can due to the mess in my head. The reason I was dismissive is because I am rather tired of other peoples assumptions and having to wade through all their premises and misunderstandings. I could see you assumed because I was from the analytical tradition that I automatically deem continental philosophy as rubbish.  However I only ever stated it does not interest me there are many other disciplines who find value in it including philosophers from the analytical tradition.,freefolk,ddw0btx,1,t5_37tpy

10895255,0,t1_de3oqbw,Theres nothing illogical about this. there is plenty that is a stretch bit its only a stretch if you restrict yourself to fixed ideals. If in the story there was an actual solid record of Danys birth Id be fine but everything we hear about ti comes from the perspective of others. In this story weve seen how well the accounts of others amount to.What Im trying to say is that it is not that hard to believe that someone wanted to hide Danys heritage. Robert felt nothing but wrath towards Rhaegar and if he ever got even a hint that this targayen looking child was his he would kill her out right the man would bring down a war upon those who hid her. Starfall had lost enough and could not risk the life of a child of their lineage. It makes perfect sense why Dany would be passed off as the daughter of Rhaella and led to somewhere in essos. It gives her a chance to live some sort of life with her family viserys is still her uncle in this scenario. Robert would have found her easily if she was at starfall varys sniffed her out across the narrows sea if she was down the way in dorne shed be dead im sorry straight up Dany would not have survived.As said above the reason to keep her identity secret is obvious Robert literally knighted the man who slaughtered Rhaegars children as the daughter of the mad king though Robert let her live for quite some time and because of the distance he himself could not see to getting her killed and everyone who was with her was trying to protect her a Viserys so yea I think its a better idea to send a child off with a bunch of loyal Targ followers than leave her in a country where she isnt guaranteed safety.Also I do love how you keep circling back to the  months thing so let me pose one question How do we know for a fact that Rhaegar didnt get a child on Ashara around the same time as Lyanna he was in Dorne at the tower of Joy which is not to far a distance. For all we know he was wooing both girls in order to form his sons perfect wife he stated he needed a third child. If thats true then Dany and Jon might actually be damn near the same age with only possibly a few months of difference. So my questions simple what solid proof in the text do you have that this is absolutely impossible? Not GRRMs word but an actual hard line from the text that at least supports the claim. I can go grab a bunch of moments from lines in the books that elude to the mystery of danys heritage but so far you keep circling back to a fact Ive given three counterpoints to.Sorry for late response life kicked in.,freefolk,de3rnzj,1,t5_37tpy

I do think its Kit and Sophies affection for each other that comes out in their scenes or rather Kits affection for Sophie. I would actually say that KitJon gives the same looks he gave Sansa last season to Edd and no one sees anything romantic there.

11132257,0,t3_5yxb8h,There is an endless debate within the fandom of who Azor Ahai is and sometimes it honestly feels like that the prophecy is used as some sort of popularity contest between Dany and Jon but lets take look of what we know of the prophecy so far and on how well it fits to both Dany and Jon.  Prophecygt There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer the Red Sword of Heroes and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again and the darkness shall flee before him.And gt When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone. What we know of the Prophecy Reborn amidst smoke and salt. Born beneath a bleeding star.  Will wake dragons out of stone.  Will draw Lightbringer from the flames.Additional info that is not in the prophecy  Will be born of the line of Aerys II and Rhaella according to the woods witch His is the song of ice and fire according to Rhaegar Targaryen Will possibly have to make a sacrifice. According to Maester Aemon the word used to describe the prince in the prophecy was a genderneutral word. While all assumed that the prince must be male Aemon recently came to believe the prophecy could point to a female as well.Daenerys Targaryen gt Born of the line of Aerys II and RhaellaDany is the daughter of Aerys and Rhaella so she is obviously directly descended from that line.gtReborn amidst smoke and salt. This is twofold for her depending what you think reborn means. The first option is Danys actual birth meaning the reincarnation interpretation at Dragonstone a volcanic island on the ocean a place of smoke and salt Mel thought so. The other option is the rebirth theory which is fulfilled by Danys night on Drogos pyre salt from her tears and smoke from the fire. gtBorn beneath a bleeding star.The night Dany walked into that pyre the red comet took to the sky. Dany was the first character to see it and called it a herald of my coming Melisandre says Azor Ahai shall be heralded by a bleeding star. Further the Dothraki called the comet shierak qiya which means bleeding star. The rebirth in smoke and salt and the bleeding star happen together. Further Aemon has a dream possibly a dragon dream about a bleeding red star and dragons.gt Will wake dragons out of stone. Again this coincides perfectly with the last two and happens quite literally. The dragon eggs were petrified literally turned to stone and from them hatched three dragons. It is also mentioned by Mel that a kings blood is needed for this to occur when she wanted to use Edric Storm to wake the stone dragons. Dany used the pyre of Drogo a Dothraki king. She also sacrificed her unborn son who had her royal blood.gtWill draw Lightbringer from the flames.This is very metaphorical for everyone. Many people have backed the theory that the dragons are Lightbringer as they were what was pulled from the flames by a warrior yes Dany is a warrior she wonwears her Dothraki warrior bells has commanded three battles and has been referred to as a warrior queen by GRRM. And Xaro literally calls the dragons a flaming sword above the world. They are a weapon that gives off heat and light. Further it took Dany three tries to burgeon them once on a brazier once during a fever dream and finally on Drogos pyre just as it took Azor Ahai three tries. And it took the sacrifice of what she loved most to bring them into the world making Drogo her Nissa Nissa. If the dragons are Lightbringer it would explain why dragons are included in the prophecy when they had nothing to do with the original Azor Ahai.gtA song of Ice and FireNow this is part is where it gets tricky for Dany being Azor Aahi and many people used the fire and ice reference from Rhaegar as conformation that Dany can not be the promised hero since she isnt related in anyway too the element of ice. However when we first find out from Rhaegar that the promised hero will have a song of ice and fire during Danys version in the house of the undying Rhaegar himself acknowledged that his own son Aegon of whom he had with his wife Elia Martell was the prince that promised and that his song is the song of ice and fire now Aegon himself just like Dany had nothing to with ice since his entire heritage is associated with heat so how come Rhaegar believed that his song is the song of ice and fire? Well first we have to remember that the prophecy of Azor Ahai is originated from the religion of Rhllor whos god is described as the fire god and their prophecy talks about the rebirth of a fiery warrior who is prophesied too fight against the darkness know as the Great OthersWW who are heavily associated with ice. Basically what Rhaegar might mean is that the song of ice and fire is the song that would be sung of the great war between ice and fire where the fiery champion of Rhllor will have too fight against the Great Others and lead its people through the ice could darkness of the long night.Random little hints Hizdahr tells Dany that he would give her riches and she jokingly tells him she wants a magical sword Viserys had often warned Dany to not wake the dragon Benerro said that Azor Ahai was born to make the world new and Danys hatching of dragons has brought magic back to the world a new age of magic in the House of the Undying it is strongly hinted that Dany will prove Stannis to be a false prophet Slayer of Lies and a vision of Stannis wielding Lightbringer similarly Quaithe tells Dany she must come to Asshai the birthplace of the Azor Ahai prophecy to learn the truthJon Snowgt Born of the line of Aerys II and RhaellaJon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen whos parents where Aerys and Rhaella making him directly descended from that line.  gt Reborn amidst smoke and salt.Well he was literally reborn in the TV show and in the books many people have taken Jons smoking wounds and Bowens tears in his death scene as his rebirth in smoke and salt. gtBorn beneath a bleeding star.In the show when Ned enters the Tower of Joy with a bloodied Dawn the ancestral sword of House Dayne which was forged from a fallen star he placed on Lyannas bed where Jon just had been born therefore ensuring that in accordance with the prophecy Jon or Azor Ahai was born when stars bleed.gt Will wake dragons out of stone.This is the one that always gets a major interpretive lens thrown on it. The one Ive seen most is the dragon woken from stone will be himself realizing his true parentage in the vaults of Winterfell. Either way he hasnt done this yet. I am personally of the mind that this is to be taken literally only because it is such a specific and to be honest random portion of the prophecy whose origin is still unknowngtWill draw Lightbringer from the flames. Again super metaphorical and this is the one Im okay with being not so literal because the whole sword of destiny thing is very overdone and Id like to see a more symbolic answer. Not to mention one flaming sword is going to fair poorly against an army of White Walkers. Ive seen people say that the Watch is Lightbringer some people say that Longclaw is Lightbringer or that Jon himself is Lightbringer and Rhaegar was Azor Ahai. None of those meet the requirement that a warrior shall draw forth from the fire a burning sword its from the fire Im concerned with not the sword part. My least favorite theory is that Dany will be Jons Nissa Nissa which is just dumb imo. Ultimately I think Jons only plausible Lightbringer is the Watch although it was mentioned by many that it must be a weapon that gives off both heat and light. Too much speculation for this to be shot down or proved correct. gtA song of Ice and FireJon being the son of Lyanna Stark ice and Rhaegar Targaryen fire would as many fans pointed out be the song of ice and fire thought his parentage.  Random little hints Jon has a dream that he is fighting the Others with a red sword Melisandre sees him in her flames when she asks for a glimpse of Azor Ahai however it should be noted that Melisandre also saw a plethora of other visions and even one of Daenerys and DrogonFinal thoughtsSo who is it? Well truth is we wont know until the end. If Azor Ahai is truly just one person I personally think it would be Daenerys but I recognize that Jon cannot be ruled out. Now Im aware that naturally many people side with Jon because he is more the type but I think thats the beauty in this. The universe the gods whatever dont care who is more fitting to the type or not they chose who they chose and imo they chose her. I also am of the mind that this person was not born to be the savior but chosen and chose to be this savior Daenerys had the chance to fly back to vaes dothrak and live out life as a crone and widow but instead she chose to take back her throne and hatch those dragons. The minute she stepped on that pyre she chose to become Azor Ahaithe Prince that was Promised and didnt even know it. However the idea I like the most is that no one will be proven beyond a doubt to be Azor Ahai but multiple people such as Dany and Jon being the prime example will fit the role and fulfill the prophecy together hence the dragon three heads and I honestly think this is what is going to happen in the TV show the very least who have propped up and referred too both Jon and Dany being the Prince the was Promised.P.S. Check out this video of Azor Ahai its very good and gives you great insight of who the prophesied hero might be.,freefolk,dettxhg,14,t5_37tpy

11361248,1,t1_dfj9nbv,Kaysen we know this is what you plan to say when half of what you said as Lads turns out wrong not that you said many things you based almost everything on Lads so subtract those parts. You probably plan to say oh they have changed things a bit but its not that different when you think about it and list a number of excuses and justifications.You can see that its not going to work people still wont believe you even if some things you said as Lads sound right in August as I said because you based everything on real spoilers anyway. If you dedicate yourself to this so much speculate this much and create so many scenarios of course you will guess some of the missing partsdetails in Lads leaks correctly we already have the outline. Im sure that some of the things I currently guess differently than you will be correct too and you will be wrong at those.So you are wasting your time with this Lads crap because you will never be able to steal Lads identity and keep acting like the new Truede during season  filming. If original Lads leaks are true and I believe they mostly are but I think he had interpreted a few things wrong too we will honor that person. Never you. You will always be the troll who tried to steal someone elses identity for attention and popularity who tried to fool everybody for months wasted everybodys time and ruined this sub. You will always be the sicko even if you are right about some of the things you said as Lads. Nobody will buy it when you will try to explain how and why they changed those parts that you were wrong about.PS. You dont really even try anymore I just saw that after I left the sub yesterday Kaysen Lads and other supporting accounts all arrived at the same time. One can see how the thread changed after I left yesterday it was completely different before you and your alternates were here. You ruin this sub and you do it intentionally you try to ruin it. You know that nobody believes you nobody likes you except one or two idiots even those few who believed you at first are at least not sure anymore so whats the point of spending your life here? Two reasons  To annoy people because you are an egomaniac who can never accept to lose and to be wrong you are like someone who says that the sky is actually yellow all people other than you are color blind and you try to drive people crazy by insisting on it although everybody sees that its not yellow. I think you enjoy treating people like this because you are a sicko thats why you are a Daenerys and Cersei stan because you identify yourself with these kinds of egomaniac women who have zero morals who treat everybody like enemies and want to fool and crush them. Because you hope that you will be able to justify yourself in August and will be able to continue fooling people next year as I said above. ,freefolk,dfjryip,1,t5_37tpy

11448925,0,t3_63e7hq,Those upset I think some are missing the likely big picture and have to keep some things in mind for season . I personally think its a plot point for the final season. Jon abandoning his KiTN title opens the door for the Iron Throne ifwhen Dany dies. There will be no ruler post war. Jons parentage will be revealed. He may very likely have their child with him. Theyll choose him to sit the Iron Throne post war and he already has an heir. Jon will hate it but he will do it anyway. It also opens the door for a true born child of Ned and Cateyln to rule the North as Warden for Jon. Kneeling to her is Danys last big monarch moment in the story. She wont make it back to KL to sit the throne. We and she saw it in her HOTU TV version vision. She gets so close she can literally touch the throne but never does.This is how I see it playing out anyway.,freefolk,dftq58w,3,t5_37tpy

As for Tyrion Id LOVE for him to live hes one of my favourites too but I fear his story arc is coming to an end at some point...idk just a gut feeling. Danys whole purpose is a bit wider than just to win a throne she carries her familys pride with her and she wants to help those in need. Shes currently after the throne in a sense yes and pay back to those who have slaughtered her entire family but I feel her perspective will change a little and already have  she seeks to bring a righteous steady ruler to people not just petty fights between many different families like she said in her speech this ones on top that ones on top....crushing those on the ground so ya shes tooting her own horn a bit but its better than just being after a throne for the thrones sake plus she will widen her horizons even more once she finds out about the White Walkers as well as Jon having Targaryen blood. Besides there wont be an iron throne at the end anyway its unlikely ice dragon will probably melt it all down and Dany will realize that once the big bad hits.,freefolk,dg326m0,3,t5_37tpy

She fights injustice with justice but she never gloats with a creepily happy face over killing her enemies. She does what needs to be done but she doesnt gloat and take some unnerving satisfaction in it like Arya and Sansa. To me both girls still act like overly emotional children and Im starting to like them less and less because of it. Ned would never have taken pleasure in killing or beheading someone.

11692804,0,t1_dgle106,gtWell first off we have no idea what their relationship will be like so you are making a lot of assumptions for all we know he could become one her closest confidantsOh lordy.  So in between making sammiches and staring lovingly into the regents eyes while she rules he can be her confidant like a good helpmate.  That makes the power dynamic between the two aka the fact that Dany could basically execute him or force him to whatever she wants SO much better.  See she actually listens to his advice which makes him a successful housewife.gtSecond Elizabeth of York didnt have much power because of Henrys mother Margaret Beaufort didnt want her to have power there is no Margaret Beanufort in A Song of Ice and Fire.Or because the queen consort unless she came from a powerful family like Catherine of Aragorn was basically there just to be a baby incubator in general?  The Yorks were pretty vanquished and out of power which is why Henry could use Elizabeth as a pawn to shore up his legitimacy.  Girl was basically a slave in the situation.gtAnd third just because A Song of Ice and Fire is inspired by The War of the Roses doesnt mean it will have characters act like their reallife counterparts did.It still means Dany is the ruler and Jon is the worthless concubine.  As I said if he kneels I would prefer the boy to go back to the Nights Watch rather than being Danys submissive housewife.  There are obviously ways that they can make a JonDany marriage palatable to me like if Dany marries the King in the North under a personal union but they go all out the window with the Danystans insistence that Jon kneel and become Snowflakes submissive concubine.,freefolk,dglebns,2,t5_37tpy
