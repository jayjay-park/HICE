6304091,0,t3_41hl4j,Retest all the way. Its self regulating. I dont sweat it anymore if a lift or two doesnt progress as quickly. To me that just means I need to stay with that weight for longer until my body adapts. I have tried both,tacticalbarbell,cz67da9,1,t5_3bvmb
6477995,0,t3_443wvi,Lennarn Thanks for the pointers. Traditionally I have always felt better with exercises like the Front squat Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat and The Deadlift. They have been my go to lower body movements in the past. All feel better and cause no knee issues at all. I have never been great at the back squat and just want to get the damn thing down lol. My DL numbers are a bit high to use it in a standard cluster x a week and I dont think RFESS would work well as the load compared to bilateral movements is lower so maybe using the front squat is the way to go until I sort the issues out. ,tacticalbarbell,czpdeco,1,t5_3bvmb

6778151,0,t3_48kcvw,Yes combat sports are a great source of conditioning. BJJ and Muay Thai are both great. Both have their advantages and differences in conditioning.  When I did BJJ I saw it as a strength endurance long jog that still kicked your ass. Muay Thai has its spurts of sprints and drills. Also knowing how to fight is always beneficial. Wrestling and boxing are a good mix too You could use the fighter template from TB and easily work in BJJ or some other combate sport.,tacticalbarbell,d0kl5aa,2,t5_3bvmb

7079248,0,t1_d1iq3b4,Something close. Essentially powerlifters aim to PR as much weight as they can within their weight class. So for them there are  main goals  PRing on each of the Big . I was wondering would that be just as important for implementing TBs approach to strength training. However as the others have mentioned since were aiming to increase strength across domains it would make more sense to focus on improving those domains within each block then shifting focus on subsequent blocks. ,tacticalbarbell,d1isq6i,1,t5_3bvmb

7592056,0,t3_4j9m1f,Ugh.  Firstly let me say that I hope its not an Achilles tear. Those are a real bear.  If it is though ask your doc and research the rehab sites. Thats one of those injuries you do NOT want to push.  New job number one becomes getting right.And yeah BB is probably going on the back burner for a while.That said if youre looking for ways to improve your strength while youre potentially on the sidelines consider dedicating time and focus to dedicated blocks of core and grip work.  Those are highvalue muscles that can be worked hard with zero stress to your lower body.Lots of people come back from serious injuries.  Very few come back on day one with six pack abs chiseled from marble and the ability to slam shut a Captains of Crush .Theres lots of things youll have to stop doing but kicking ass aint one of them. ,tacticalbarbell,d356g2w,2,t5_3bvmb

7694802,0,t1_d3fumc6,Glad you asked...excerpt from TB rd EdIs SE mandatory?No. Listen if youre just interested in getting as strong as you can and being wellconditioned you dont HAVE to do any SE work at all. Chances are youre going to get some anyway if youre following the TB conditioning protocols. SE is for you if youre interested in focusing on it for whatever reason. Maybe youre an operator of some sort or want to be. Or youre doing your first fight camp for a competitive bout. Maybe SE has always been a weak area for you and you want to bring it up to speed along with the rest of your abilities. But if your only priority is maximalstrength then why waste time and energy on SE? SE is more for the tactical professional or those planning to be tactical professionals. If youre a recreational trainee its totally optional.  ,tacticalbarbell,d3gul0c,1,t5_3bvmb

7984207,0,t3_4ol19a,Good question... I would say that if your movement is explosive youre entering powerbuilding. I could be wrong but I believe powers optimally built in the lower range  the lift being done as quicklyexplosively as possible. I can see potential for problems when you start hitting the  reps zone during SE with the CampJ. With that in mind I think youre on the right track youre probably better off swapping out the CampJ for things like the rowpush press until your SE blocks finished. ,tacticalbarbell,d4di0ub,3,t5_3bvmb
8048901,0,t1_d4kdop7,True.  Its hard to separate variables.  Day to day I do let it direct my volume of training.  However much of the stuff Im doing right now doesnt seem to have a huge impact on my HRV.  This is good because it seems to have allowed my HRV score to improve over time.  Because I work a job with sleep disruption HRV has helped me to get a hold of that and given me another form of feedback besides subjective to let me know where Im at.  That feedback has helped me to see that I need to put more emphasis on sleep and balance and less emphasis on high stress workouts when Im already under a lot of physical and mental stress.,tacticalbarbell,d4krsv0,1,t5_3bvmb

8639179,0,t3_4y6ha7,Looks fine.When I was doing BB and had to travel I stopped in at gyms like that on the road.  I found it far easier to be on BB in those places than trying to find a decent squat rack.One thing they almost all have that is handy for BB high rep low weight is the racked barbells that have the weights permanently on the bars usually in  pound increments.You can do all this with those racks and just some floor space except the bench.  But you can probably get away with a flat bench since the weights to do  reps are necessarily light. front squats deadlifts standing bent rows shrugs overhead press or push press benchThese could all be done with dumbells too but I preferred the racked barsplates when I could find them.Three sets of that in week  is  reps.

8912846,0,t3_52bi44,Powerlifters use floor press to work on lockout strength and remove the chest from the equation. I would recommend trying to get ringsTRX and do a weighted ring push up.

So add a little maxstrength to your week with Fighter or Operator. If you have an extra day during the week when youre not rolling then by all means do a HIC or E from the book.
