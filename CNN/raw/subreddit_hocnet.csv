1485939,0,t1_cib48pa,the developers of meshnet have a decent understanding and support for the idea of selling bandwidth but some of the community is staunchly opposed to any sort of money in the system. Its not a problem on their end at the moment because their codebase is currently focused on a working mesh not monetization and wide scale adoption at some point I assume the conflict would come to a head though. ,hocnet,cj2jcyf,2,t5_2u5p0
