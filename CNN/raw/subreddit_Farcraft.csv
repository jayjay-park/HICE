7881541,0,t1_d41smfn,ah so youre one of those developers.Its not my fault that my project is broken in  cases out of  everyone else just needs to get better at fixing my broken programsAnd just for reference doom can run maxed out on my virtual machine yeah I go overkill on my gaming setups so when I tell you your game has performance issues you dont really get to dismiss that out of had as pfft VM whatever because my VM has more power in it than most full desktops. But if you want to stay in denial and block out every bit of feedback that isnt just heaping praise on you then please keep doing that.Minecraft continues to be great because they listen to their community even when the community disagrees with a decision they really wanted to make. You are incapable of even hearing that your game isnt perfect and ready to sweep up the whole market. Even if you accidentally do touch greatness at one point inevitably your game will be dragged back down by the tide of your own ego because you make your projects for yourself while games like minecraft are made for the players.You are not a game developer with this mindset. You arent any kind of developer at all. You could have  years industry experience but if this is how you still think youre just some wannabe,Farcraft,d41yitv,6,t5_2vu1p

8196760,0,t1_d51temo,The Farcraft Null Hypothesis Got to be scientific about gamesdev you know?  I think he explains it in one of the pinned posts but basically hes saying he can make a cubic voxel game that supasses MC and therefore falsify the null hypothesis I personally thought that gamesdev was an art that happens to use skillsets from some sciences like computing and mathematics  Not a science in itself but what do I know  Im only a Hobbyist ,Farcraft,d525bsm,2,t5_2vu1p
