While I myself went with Gronk in round  in a different league if you miss this opportunity for a top tier QB you may end up having to waste your rd pick. Round  could become a mad dash arms race for QBs at which point youre going to be stuck with shitty options for your rd round. ,2QB,ctfmmrv,1,t5_32xk9
