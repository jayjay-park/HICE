2778105,0,t1_cnjudre,Theres honestly not much in the way of sprawl. Ive seen vastly larger cities and Aurora was planned to be somewhat compact from the beginning. There are some abandoned lots and Ive offered a policy for dealing with that in the past.Negotiate on projects or infrastructure where it is lacking.A singular authority is not needed but an organization to deal with security would be since returning to activity means preparing for threats. ,CivAgora,cnjv0e5,1,t5_2y83n

The key parts of a functional defense force on Civcraft is intelligence gathering snitches and radar communication a potential secure sub channel in mumble and gear a lot of old Aurorans have Prot IV alreadyIf we keep the snitches up and allow citizens to see and report suspicious activity then mumble should take care of the rest this is why I hope people use the mumble a ton as the town grows bigger ,CivAgora,cnn7ho9,2,t5_2y83n

5323642,0,t1_cvs572c,I would like to go over your original stipulations which I would like to remind you are legally binding I know that because I am a trained elawyergt I will give Tambov d on three conditionsgt . The officials in Tambov rename their nation from Tambov to Nightwingaville.gt . The officials in Tambov spell the word summit correctly.gt . The diamonds are stored in cobblestone can be provided if Nightwingaville does not currently have cobblestone.gt If any of the three conditions are broken at any time I reserve the right to take back the diamonds given.You use the word rename in your comment.This word is defined by dictionary.com as to give a name to.In our referendum we have given a name to what was previously the Auroran Republic. It is now named Nightwingaville as your stipulations required.If you do not follow through with this I will call upon my firm of elawyers and pursue litigation.

8924793,0,t3_52hqcr,In the early morning hours of the ninth of September two thousand and some odd years after the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I purchased the central  shop plot in Statue Park Mall from ScarredWarlord otherwise known as BelovedDictator.That evening it came to my attention that the shop had been first blocked off from the public the chest and the sign attached to it broken and me evicted from the plot without refund. The screenshots are provided by ScarredWarlord hereAll three of these actions are illegal or would be if we had a legal code. Having purchased the shop the area was now my property. ScarredWarlord placed blocks and signs on the property against my permission essentially griefing my shop. ScarredWarlord then proceeds to raid my shop breaking the chest. He does this under the pretense of having a warrant from the Chancellor. In these pictures of our Slack   and  Scarred receives a warrant from our Chancellor for the search of that chest. However this warrant is unconstitutional. Article VII.a.ii states that gt After due consideration the Chancellor Pantarch or Assembly may order a search be performed of the land for reasons of suspected harbinger of criminals or possession of stolen goods. Any property acquired or destroyed in such a search shall be returned to the affected player. Scarred requests the search of the chest as proof that its a scam. Searches are allowed under the Auroran charter for suspicions of harboring criminals or possessing stolen goods neither of which was cited in the reason for the search of the shop chest. Scarred may argue that I had stolen  of his coal ore but that was not mentioned in the issuance of the warrant. The eviction from the shop without refund is also unlawful or at least it should be. What kind of landlord should be able to sell note that I was sold the plot on leased it and have the right to take it back without any process for appeal or without due process of law. Moreover I was not given a refund on my purchase of the shop which was one diamond. For this robbery I request that I be given back from ScarredWarlord all the items that I had listed in my original post.,CivAgora,d7kmnwx,1,t5_2y83n
