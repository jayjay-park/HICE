11593077,0,t3_658nlp,I actually found a doodle I really liked in MML and even though its standard I like it a lot and plan on training it. The doodle is the one with the yellow head sprig yellow tail and looks quite a bit like Fluffy and I named him Beanstalk and he is so cute. Thank you all so much for the help though!,toontownrewritten,dga30mm,1,t5_2yk37

11745016,0,t1_dgrawz5,This is very simple so I apologize if it seems like Im overexplaining.Theres probably a File Explorer icon on your taskbar. If not you can open File Explorer through your Start menu.Copy CTRLC or rightclick gt Copy CProgram Files xToontown Rewrittenlogs and paste it into the search bar Press enter and youll be in the logs folder. Find a recent one that you know for a fact is from a session that you crashed during open it up copy all the text inside of it and submit paste it to Pastebin.comCopy the Pastebin link and post it here.If youre not sure about which sessions youve crashed in you should hop on TTR and play until you get one of those spontaneous crashes. Then you can find the most recent log file and use that one.,toontownrewritten,dgrbslb,6,t5_2yk37
11758241,0,t3_67qanv,All great suggestions! A lot of them weve already considered and even begun to implement.Some point last year we made a fishing bucket which would be placed in estates after purchasing from the Cattlelog. It had a portable hole in the bottom that allowed you to sell fish. Implementation wasnt finished as we started our team reform which led to the content being released right now.As for making Toons normal size thats something easy to do. Do you think it need to be done for all cheesy effects or just the big head?,toontownrewritten,dgstri6,11,t5_2yk37
11788399,0,t3_687899,A video Ill be working on all these week what Im trying to work on is adding new animations hopefully Retexture new models hopefully and many more.

11808134,0,t3_68h4d8,The Toon Name Guidelines are listed over here and unfortunately I think that I can see why your name was rejected. I understand its frustrating that you cant get your Toontown Online name but the reason our moderation team is so strict on name rules is to maintain consistency. While you may think that the Toontown Online team was better at name approval at a lot of times they were very inconsistent which caused frustration from players. We want to avoid that. We bend our rules in the first place to allow some Toontown Online names through that may not have necessarily made it see the pun names but we cant do that for every situation.Once Upon A Time just simply isnt a name. And as corny as it sounds the way to bend that rule would be to turn it into a name along the lines of Oncepon A. Time. This doesnt mean that we cant change our name guidelines but while the rule is in place we need to stay consistent with it to be fair to all players.,toontownrewritten,dgyhr83,9,t5_2yk37
