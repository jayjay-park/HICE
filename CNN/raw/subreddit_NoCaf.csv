You could always go the insanity route amp get an extra large coffee which should pretty much give you a big reminder of why you quit in the first place.  It is an addiction but at least it is less harmful than others so dont feel too bad if you fail you can always try again.  The thing about all the fun you are remembering is with an addictive substance there is always a price to pay for the fun its never just a purely positive experience so I guess figure out if the price is worth it or not.,NoCaf,cg0gwnn,2,t5_2u6fb
676758,0,t1_cgh5t77,thanks for the tips I think an alternative beverage is a really good idea especially if it tastes kind of similar.  The phlegm one is pretty nasty I dont know if I can pull that one off but its worth a shot.  what is the counter that you use do you just mean when the sun goes down?,NoCaf,cgh74m7,1,t5_2u6fb
