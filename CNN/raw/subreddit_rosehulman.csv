But on campus you get the normal stuff.I think anybody living in the Great Lakes region or Illinois Indiana and Michigan should be knowledgeable about what they should expect. People coming from more southern climates should expect to have to use the defrosting function on their heater and purchaselearn to use an ice scraper.,rosehulman,crnyk6g,2,t5_2s3z6
