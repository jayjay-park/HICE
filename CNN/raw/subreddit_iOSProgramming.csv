1051149,0,t3_263nbi,Take a step back for a second.The remote service is the only party in the conversation that knows how long the response is valid for. When you request search results from Google you should not make assumptions about how long those search results will be valid for  Google should be telling you. You should not be assuming that the results will always be different or that they will never change. Only the service can know. But it can tell you!The HTTP protocol supports freshness information out of the box. This information formalizes the means for a server to tell a client how long a response is valid for when to revalidate it etc. In practice this is most often used by both client and remote caches to determine how long to hold onto responses received from a server.On iOS and MacOS NSURLCache does all of the hard work for you. When you make a request to a remote resource the URL loading system defaults to NSURLRequestUseProtocolCachePolicy which implements the logic of the HTTP protocol specification. NSURLCache will see the freshness information sent by the server and act accordingly. So if you make a request for an image and the freshness information specifies this is good for a week every time you request that image during that week it will be served from the cache rather than the network. The cache is your persistence layer.This means that if the JSON REST service you are making requests to implements that freshness information  which is clearly its responsibility  its very difficult to justify implementing another layer of caching or persistence on top of that i.e. Core Data Syncing. Its unnecessary complexity and in practice it can be very problematic. Ive worked on several applications that implemented syncing in most of those we ended up removing that persistence layer and letting the protocol do the work. That gave us a more reliable stable and trouble free application.There are of course plenty of APIs and services out there that return absolutely incorrect freshness information. It happens. It sucks. Its still the responsibility of the service to get it right even if you may have to work around it on the client. If you control the service though take a step back and come up with a plan for delivering that freshness information. Your app will thank you.,iOSProgramming,chnrqqb,2,t5_2s61a

Examples are things like ARC Auto Layout and Storyboards.You wont need to know Swift for iOS  but my guess is that after  years iOS  the community will have had enough time to learn it and Apple will be providing most if not all of their sample code using Swift and trying to find a job as a pure ObjC guy will land you a sweet sweet position maintaining some legacy code at some boring enterprise company.,iOSProgramming,chzf0q1,1,t5_2s61a

The first half of the book is probably most important then I think it gets to the point where you can dip in after that.

1444134,0,t1_cix2lno,gt Its called by every view controller when it has finished loading. No thats incorrect.  Its called when a view controllers main view has finished loading not when the view controller itself has finished loading hence the name viewDidLoad and not viewControllerDidLoad or just didLoad.  The view controller itself is fully instantiated first and the view is lazy loaded so viewDidLoad can happen a long time after the view controller has finished loading.Take for example instantiating a view controller then pushing it onto a navigation controllers stack in code.  You might do something like this    ViewController viewController  ViewController alloc initWithDetailsfoo    self.navigationController pushViewControllerviewControllerNow after the first line has executed the view controller is fully instantiated.  Youve got a real view controller you can send messages to.  But the view has not yet been loaded because this is often an expensive operation that is better put off until its really necessary.Then in the second line the view controller gets pushed onto the navigation stack and when it comes time to animate it in its view property is accessed which ends up calling loadView.  Once that loads the view and returns viewDidLoad is called.In practice there can be a wide gap between a view controller being created and its view being loaded.  A view controller and its main view are very different things and just because one is loaded it doesnt mean they both are.,iOSProgramming,cixar11,1,t5_2s61a

1716361,0,t1_cjvbzj3,A few things I should mention about my background...I have had very little experience programmingThis is true. I took a comp sci class in high school where we coded in Visual Basic but that was  years ago. I also took a physics class in college about  years ago where we did some coding in MATLAB. The thing is though I hated both of those classes so I didnt put in a lot of effort to learn! Side note I think I realized I really enjoyed programming when I joined the class and went to meet ups to talk about the work. I tried to surround myself with people that also really enjoyed it.I worked fulltime on the course for the full  months worked a little on the side for some extra cash.I then worked another  months on my own apps.I read iOS and ObjectiveC Big Nerd Ranch books outside the course. Not cover to cover more as a reference for sections I didnt understandI also did tutorials on RayWenderlich.com who also has some awesome literature on programming.I live in New Jersey so I went into New York City every chance I could to meet up with other developers designers recruiters ...and any tech meet up I could find.In the end its really like learning another language and ObjectiveC is one of the more difficult ones to learn. But dont be discouraged. Theres a hump that you have to get over to learn the basics but once you understand that foundation everything else comes very naturally. Im not going to say it was easy it was very hard very frustrating at times but I guarantee if you put in the time and effort focus on learning for hours everyday you will get a job. It took me about  months I know quite a few people that have done it in as little as  months. If you do it parttime I imagine it will take even longer.

Give the end position a low priority like  in IB and the start position a really high priority like  not  that doesnt work!. Then switch the priorities in your animation block.Whats the advantage?You can see the beginning and the end position of your animation by just changing priorities in Interface Builder. If want to change your end position later on its just a static constraint to change in Interface Builder instead of a magic constant in your code.

I dont believe Apple screens for copyright violations but they may catch the more blatant ones. They dont want to be in the business of enforcing copyright law but if it comes to their attention they cant really be negligent either. You can expect a DMCA takedown ceaseanddesist andor lawsuit if discovered by the rights owner. Being that you knowingly did it you wont get any sympathy if you get sued over it.Its crazy that people are pulling this shit in the iOS App Store...

2392789,0,t3_2msejj,I think companies will want to put watch apps on the store.  The apple watch is a luxury product many people will pay a lot extra for the gold version or the steel version and those people are going to be a lot more likely to pay for apps that support their very expensive toy.  If youre buying a  dollar watch whats . more to make it do a lot more cool stuff?  You wont target the most customers that way but youll target the ones most willing to spend.  But that doesnt translate into hiring jr. devs in swift.  Anyone with strong fundamentals should be able to learn swift pretty easily.  The skills transfer.  It would be much better to hire a good developer with no experience in swift than to hire a bad developer who knows swift but not objectivec even if the goal was for that developer to write exclusively in swift.  I dont think knowing the swift language is a huge barrier for deciding which devs you hire but not knowing fundamentals is a huge barrier.  Suppose you are hiring a chef for a Mexican restaurant.  Two cooks apply.  A cook who can cook French and Thai food at a high level run a restaurant and shows continuous learning but hasnt cooked any Mexican food yet.

Its much much easier to set up constraints and use size classes when youre using IB. This is particularly useful as Apple continues to add different screen sizes. Your view controllers have much less code in them and are much easier to read. It can be tough to visualize views set up in code especially if youre working with other people and youre not the one who set the views up originally.

You end up with  offcolor blurry lines instead of  solid white line. You may have to zoom in to see this is a small image. I also recommend viewing it in a program that doesnt do image smoothing for zoomed images. Browsers like to smooth images to prevent pixellation but in this case you want to see the raw pixels.This is a very simple icon I pulled for a demo.

AutoLayout will try to satisfy the  constraint before a  constraint then the  constraint and so on ... so weight them accordingly.For the items that should be no larger than one value and no smaller than another value use a less than or equal paired with a greater than or equal set so youre constraining the number somewhere between the two.That said by deciding how many pixels it should be on one device vs the other youre still trying to do pixel perfect placement of UI elements and thats not what youre supposed to be doing anymore with Auto Layout and Size Classes.  Instead youre supposed to be nailing down your static areas and the areas that should expand or compress in the space left over. Then let AL do its thing to expandcompress everything in that left over space as it sees fit.  You should give it hints so it doesnt compress one control to some ridiculous extent while giving another a ton of space but you shouldnt be trying to place all controls in a pixelperfect way based on known screen dimensions.  If you do what happens when the next device comes out with different dimensions from whats known now?

Youll need to store how many coins a user has and which magazines theyve bought with your coins. Fortunately Apple does provide something that I think would solve this problem. Look at iCloud Server. It should let you identify users by their Apple ID and share state across devices associated with that ID.

Are they freelancers theyre used to clients providing specs or they have their own template or do they have jobs their job might have a standard practice? See what theyre comfortable with dealing with already. Make sure they design their assets in highresolution for less headaches they should be vectors really  you cant upsize only downsize after all. See the Ultimate Guide To iPhone Resolutions Do they use iOS? Android? iOS is obviously more helpful since they will have more experience with iOS UI design even if they havent done any mobile design per se. You can provide pixel point constraints or you can provide ratios ie. a table view cell is generally x of course you can make it whatever youd like. Its best to start with initial sketches but Id recommend segmenting each component for them to design and list the components for them. For example a table view cell is one a button is one a label is one friendly errorsuccess messages etc. Youre not likely to have  different label designs because itll make your app inconsistent. Keep in mind that if you plan on making your app localizable the design should adapt for variable widths. Alot of designers like a point of reference.

Get apps on the store while youre getting it and come out with both a degree and apps in the store. You can always get it later but when youre working and living off that money you wont want to or be able to stop to get your degree. And doing it while working sounds like a nightmare. No need to put yourself into big debt. Go somewhere that is local and maybe cheaper. Your choice but I vote degree.

5890814,0,t1_cxrq3uo,gt o the app hangs on load while its fetching this file? Then you piss off the users?gt No the correct way to handle this is to have the backend API check the version. In every request you send the app version. In every response you send the API version. The API recognizes older app versions and formats the response data accordingly. You also use different URLs for the different API versions such as vapisomething and vapisomething.gt If the app and backend change so significantly that theres just no way they can ever work together then you should rethink the design itself.But the point is eventually supporting this capability for a dwindling number of users is cost prohibitive.  There needs to be some way to let users know a new version is out there and that their time on the current version is coming to an end.

6364986,0,t1_czd0d2e,gt Can you elaborate on what this is?Its a way of ensuring that only one thing can be modifying a resource at a time and anything reading that resource sees a consistent state. When correctly implemented it makes that resource safe to access from any thread. There are a lot of wrong ways to do it and a lot of correct but not performant ways. For example if its done using the synchronized keyword the performance in both the contended and uncontended cases is.... not good. But using a serial queue correctly is much much more efficient and simpler to get correct. See below.gt Any particular year off the top of your head you can think of?Concurrency Programming Guide Eliminating Lockbased Code WWDC  Mastering Grand Central Dispatch WWDC  Asynchronous Design Patterns with Blocks GCD and XPCBut Ill give you the cliffs notes version. The simplest implementation would be to use a serial queue and dispatchasync for any write operation i.e. any change to your collection and dispatchsync for any read operation i.e. getting a value from your collection or getting a copy of the whole collection. Any and all access to the object being protected would have to go through these. The WWDC sessions show how to use the dispatch barrier API to make the same thing work with a concurrent queue which for most people offers no benefit.for an mutable array property you would have something like.... NSUInteger countOfThings block NSUInteger result  dispatchsyncself queue result  self collection countreturn result void addThingidthing dispatchasyncself queue self collection addObjectthingetc. Obviously even that can be simplified and abstracted but you should get the idea. And ANY modification of that property should go through the queue like you see there. The concurrency guide and WWDC sessions go into this deeper though the WWDC sessions not so much on this specific subject.gt This brings up another question. All our views and sometimes data objects are implemented programmatically and often looks something like this...Let me stop you right there.UIKit can only be used and only accessed from the main thread. If you had good tests on this you might see that the dispatchgetmainqueue never gets executed  because its always on the main thread already! More on this in a second but you can REMOVE this macro from all of your UIKit classes view controllers views. A word on macros. A macro like this CREATETHREADSAFEINSTANCE is just token replacement. When the preprocessor sees CREATETHREADSAFEINSTANCE in the source it replaces it with the contents of that macro. In your case thats hiding complexity. Complexity is any path through the code  any if something for example increases your complexity. Here this macro is hiding that and spreading it throughout your code. This isnt a good thing and in this specific case the same functionality could be centralized and the complexity would be fixed i.e. it would be  instead of   SUMCREATETHREADSAFEINSTANCE .You want to really look at what your macros are buying you and be sure to occasionally check the preprocessor output in Xcode to see what the actual code thats going to be compiled looks like. There are often surprises in there do to macros and these surprises arent always visible in the debugger and other tools.If you have data model objects that are creating and returning view objects.... that would be odd. If thats the case you would have to only touch those view objects on the main queue. Of course whatever is calling the method that returns a view would also in almost every case have to be running on the main queue that may be moot.,iOSProgramming,czd4n58,1,t5_2s61a

Design so that you are not sharing data between threads and you have no need for thread safety. Dont have two threads share data.

6893763,0,t1_d0xozwx,gt What you do not want to do is entangle your view controllers in such a way that you cant change the design of your app without rewriting heaps of code.Here are ways Ive done exactly that. Walked the View Controller hierarchy to find the related VC cast it to the thing I think its supposed to be and set a property on it. This is brittle times ten. Passed in a reference to the related view controller to set a property or value explicitly. This is simple and clean until the presentation order changes and then you have to drill a pipe through any intervening view controller to pass that reference through. You might say Okay but passing a reference to the master into the detail in a UISplitView is probably safe. What could go wrong? Trust me LOTS. Used half a dozen or more NSNotifications which then I have to go hunt down every instance of when something changes and invariably I misspell the name of the notification one place or think its update when its really updated or something stupid like that and then wonder why that one doesnt work.The best solution Ive found to this is to keep data models separate from view controllers Wait...

7025734,0,t3_46i91t,I went to the class last month and am leaving a review here for future visitors. My thoughtsprosconsIts a really great class and you can learn a lot from it whether you are a complete beginner to iOS or already an intermediate developer. Beforehand I was skeptical that it would be possible to really cover all the topics that they said they would but I think they did a good job of covering the basics in those areas and giving you enough knowledge be able to figure out the more indepth things for yourself. I was very pleased.ProsThe instructor knows iOS very well. He has worked with iOSOS X for more than  years and can answer any possible question you have.Hands on learning. While there is some lecturing to explain concepts a decent portion of the class is spent typing code which is really the best way to learn.Lots of examples. As a lot of the time is spent writing code this means you can use these examples to look back on later and studyThe most important topics in iOS covered MapKit Core Location Core Animation Networking Core Data UIKit and moreThe instructor does a very good job of explaining the iOS infrastrucutre behind the scenes. Meaning not just typing code that can be copy and pasted but WHY things are done the way they are. For example he explains why the delegation pattern is so common in iOS why Swift usually uses pass by value as opposed to the Objective C pass by reference amongst other things. He does a good job of explaining the world of iOS and the Cocoa Touch frameworks that largely compose it so that you understand the code youre writing not just copying it.The instrcutor was very willing to help. Any time someone had a problem he would go to their computer and personally help them  on  with the issue. Cons It was only  week. The training really is very intense and there is a lot to take in. Class was  Lunch usually  and then class . There was also  additional  minute breaks in the morning and afternoon. For me the hours were really long. I woud have preferred it to last . or  weeks instead of just the  week but I understand they have their own projects and things to do at the company so time is an issue. Dont get me wrong Im glad it was really intense and that I coud learn a lot I just felt the days were a little long. But thats really the only con out of everything. Overall a great experience and I would certainly recommend it to any beginnerintermediate iOS developer who really wants to further their education in iOS.,iOSProgramming,d1cpxey,2,t5_2s61a

7074995,0,t1_d1i7wb7,Were getting amazing information.  Weve tested the accuracy of our longitudelatitude versus geological fences on the server and were accurate within  meters for enabling user features based on location.  However some users are getting battery drain because our update locations delegate method is being called for even the slightest changes.  Weve set our desired accuracy to best for navigation however I feel that its battery intensive to have it set to that accuracy all the time.  What I want is a way to set the desired accuracy to a higher threshold because for certain accuracy settings the GPS antenna is used sparingly as you said.  As you can read here certain accuracy settings will cause the GPS antenna to be used with the lowest accuracy only using cellular tower triangulation but a high accuracy leads to excessive use of GPS antenna.  We require accuracy at least up to  meters because our vendors require us to ensure users are on location and not all are able to use iBeacons for bluetooth location activation.  So making the app work with what little information we get from lower accuracy isnt a good idea.  Ill attempt a lower accuracy rolling method and see what happens.  If they disable location always then theres nothing we can do about that but were trying to make sure that if they give us that permission they arent suffering for it. ,iOSProgramming,d1ibbni,1,t5_2s61a

The onoff switch should actually be a checkmark but the mockup software didnt have it. Once the user can successfully complete  sets of  reps of an exercise they move onto the next hardest variation of that category... that could be a larger more meaningful achievement. Im trying to gamify fitness with this idea. On refining Good point with the offshore developers. That makes sense. I have many ideas about how the final app would look like Progress bars for each category and total progress like a video game with quests.

If I remember right the preview at least for pictures is already  and you can have  cases   screen iphone  size   or the others. if you have a  screen the preview will take full size of the screen and youll have your control halftransparents if you have a bigger screen there will be a margin at top navigationcontrols.. then the preview will be full width and  and at bottom there will be some more place for some controls. ,iOSProgramming,d5jg9wq,3,t5_2s61a

8762539,0,t3_4zyujk,I have been experimenting with various MVVM designs in the last few months in several larger scale apps.First I started with using RxSwift for the communication between the view model and the controller. It worked and certainly there are some nice ideas but I am not really sure I am sold on the whole Reactive idea. It is a lot of added complexity sometimes with dubious benefit.Also the code becomes extremely off putting to any developer with no Reactive experience.Later I switched to just using delegates and closures for the VM ltgt Controller interaction. For me it is completely enough. The code is much simpler iOSflavoured and easier to understand by other developers.The way I am implementing is all the networking and presentation logic date number formatting string interpolation etc are moved out of the controller and it is only concerned with UI objects and populating them with data and relaying of user events to the VM and networkprocessing results from the VM.I definitely like it and prefer it over vanilla MVC. It gives much better separation of concerns and allows for much much easier testability.In cases of super simple controllers such as a login form I skip it altogether of course as it would be only overhead with no benefit.I have being toying with the idea of something like VIPER as a next logical step in making everything more granular but so far the even more overhead outweights the benefits for me.I often read pretty much only here on riosprogramming how it is not a good fit for iOS or how somebody had bad experience trying to implement it but to me it looks like this is result of bad implementation or architecture design than inherent issues with the MVVM pattern.,iOSProgramming,d70z8qa,2,t5_2s61a

With that being said you are probably wondering So how can I make my own functional app that has a decent design and a backend for data?.

For now Im going to stick with my  until something interesting comes along.Another suggestion since you mentioned you are in romania where I assume apple products are even more absurdly priced than in the US would be to build a hackintosh. I was able to build a hackintosh to start out as an ios dev that had the specs of a mac pro for about  usd. To build one with equivalent specs to the  mbp it would even be cheaper.

9881419,0,t3_5gt09w,First of all if youve only been in this trade for four months try not to get too discouraged.  Theres simply many issues that they dont teach you in college or other classes that only comes out when you are working in the field and it takes time to get that knowledge under your belt.  As long as you can learn from the experiences youre having youre improving.  Dont take it as a sign that youre not cut out for this  in fact if you can experience these problems and fix them its a sign that you are cut out for this job.  Because thats what programming is solving problems.Also be aware that app crashes and the like are not solely the domain of the novice.  Even expert developers can write crashing code from time to time.  The key is getting better and better about writing code that has fewer bugs.  And getting tactics in place to defend against them like writing tests defensive programming etc.  Youll get there.  Youre learning the whys and hows with your experiences right now.  Programmers who go through this experience understand how and why to make their code better.As to answer your question the biggest problem Ive faced is the sheer amount of products Ive worked on.  Ive been working in the same studio for many years now and I have responsibility for scores of web applications browser games mobile games etc.  None of them take much effort to maintain individually but a week doesnt go by when I dont need to drop what Im doing and go address some issue that has come up with one of these old applications because of the inexorable advance of technology.  Like having to make a web site from  mobile friendly or porting an old Flash educational module to HTML.I realize this is a good problem to have I guess but the lesson Id like to impart on younger studios  developers from this is to make sure that you have a clear understanding with the client when your responsibility is over for the code that you write.  There should be a clear end of life agreed upon or at least a wellunderstood cost to revisiting old code preferably one that ramps up in price year over year.  Depending on who your boss is it may be futile but insofar as you can control that its wise to get it in place.The other lesson is that each project you make comes with a longterm cost.  Is it worth it to revamp an old project?  Often the answer is duh yes! because the original project was valuable but that often isnt considered against the value of what you could be working on instead.  Its seldom is it worth X hours to refit this app with feature Y?  More often than not it is is it worth not adding feature X to our flagship to add feature Y to this old app?Good luck in your programming career.,iOSProgramming,davkm4k,2,t5_2s61a

Ive got a backup plan to self fund the business.Basically it would be a business where you submit you ideaprojectcode and I put it on the App Store for you.

Newbie developer here teaching myself swift by building an app.Currently my main VC is set up like the illustration above. I have a header UIView that contains the title and a side scrolling collection view and below that a UICollectionView taking up the rest of the screen. Currently content scrolls under the header section. What Id like to do is allow my collectionview to scroll above my header content. Ive tried a few things  Adding a transparent empty UIView into the collectionView and making the collectionview full screen Removing the clipping from the collectionview so content can go outside the frame Adding the entire header area as a cell inside the collectionview None of the above options worked.

I have a full time job granted its software engineering but its doing stuff not even close to mobile development a relationship a sort of social life and was working out  times a week.Not the case anymore. In order to dedicate the time needed to make my apps I had to get rid of something and I try to make sure sleep isnt one of them since missing sleep usually turns into unhealthier lifestyle choices.I cut my workouts to the weekend only and eat healthy  of the time to balance out missing workouts.

10891641,0,t3_5vmvhh,Ditch storyboards use XIBs but only to declare Autolayout constraints and size class behaviors. Everything else should be written in codefont text color content mode etc. My reasons Storyboards are a maintenance time bombits not even about the merging hell. You put so many views for so many view controllers in a single file and you  wonder why it incurs a huge fucking delay to load and  scramble to look for the view controller you want to edit among the mess of rectangles and arrows. You can minimize this with multiple storyboards but each one of those can become their own messes. Do you know how many lines of code it takes to push a VC in a navigation controller or show it as a modal? Two at the least. Do everything else in code so that you can see it explicitly declared in awakeFromNibmakes it easier to debug. You dont go wondering where the fuck is this view setting the prevailing background color? And then you spend like half a day digging through your view hierarchy looking at the Attributes Inspector of every single UI element in it.As an example I had just started writing a new version for my expense tracker app at  see the v branch.,iOSProgramming,de3e8z4,11,t5_2s61a

11266371,0,t1_df8vuzq,Languages being cross platform is a non issue. Most major languages and their foundation libraries are cross platform. Swift is already cross platform Java is cross platform C is cross platform etc etc. The point is a language being cross platform doesnt gain you anything if you want to make a cross platform client app because you need cross platform UI toolkits for that. So thats why cross platform development for client apps not server apps is always focused on the UI toolkits like React Native or Unity for games. But then you run into the problem that building a single UI for multiple platforms is a UX mistake. Different platforms have different UX patterns so if youre doing your job properly you have to build a different UI for each platform. At which point you lose a lot of the benefits of a cross platform UI toolkit. So then whats the benefit of something like React Native? The benefits are a cross domain developer knowledge ie an Android or web developer being able to quickly build an iOS app without months of learning. And b supposedly faster and easier development of UI code. Though personally I think that point B tends to be false you incur extra costs when you use something like React Native that ultimately negate the supposed gains. And I think point A is only a good reason to adopt a cross platform UI toolkit if you project is budget and resource constrained. Otherwise its better to just do the job properly on each platform. tldr Swift is already cross platform. React Native is probably not the silver bullet its made out to be and is likely only a good choice for newbies or low quality projects being built on the cheap.,iOSProgramming,df90z2v,4,t5_2s61a

And since there are more ways to do thing X it means fewer people are actually doing it any given way which means the community has a harder time fixing bugs since its so fragmented.As an iOS developer who has recently gotten into android a bit I can honestly say we dont need to take any tips from android development into iOS.

I really wish the Apple team would step up and improve Xcode in a number of ways. I generally find Xcode painful to use.For ObjC programming AppCode is a lot better than Xcode in a number of areas worse in a few. It needs some work in the Swift area but that is understandable as Swift is a moving target. I really wish Apple would get into an IDE war with IntelliJ which could cause a ton of improvements to Xcode.Refactoring is a big area VCS integration is another. Xcode gets away with the minimal VCS possible so you must use the command line GitHub SourceTree or a mixture of all of them to get things done.Sucks with Xcode updates you get to download .GB of updates only to find out almost nothing in the IDE improved but you just got access to new SDK features and new simulators.I know on Android the SDK and emulator is split out from the IDE and some complain that you have to install a mishmash of stuff to get it all working but the IDE actually updates with new features and that came happen out of step with and SDK update from Google.Calling Xcode perfect is not helping the iOS community.

Probably the best way to accomplish what youre going for here if I understand correctly would be to use a horizontal stackView. You could drag  small UIViews side by side centre your labels in each of the UIViews select all four UIViews then push the embed in stack icon nd from the left for the storyboard icons.  This will make sure that extends across the screen expanding the views as needed and it makes it easy to tweak with the stackView settings. ,iOSProgramming,dfsij2c,3,t5_2s61a
