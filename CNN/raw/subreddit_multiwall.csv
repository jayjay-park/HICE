593441,0,t3_20x8zg,Ive seen this a few times while looking for multi monitor wallpaper. I think its very cool and wish I played and cared enough about DOTA to put it to use. Still I can appreciate its design.,multiwall,cg7q857,2,t5_2yeqk

894912,0,t3_24aosi,The only two ways I can think of fixing this. Manually cut the image into its three parts then stitch them back together in the correct order.. Buy Displayfusion. Other than that manually move your monitors around?,multiwall,ch607s8,2,t5_2yeqk
