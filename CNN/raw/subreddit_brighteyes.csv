2025622,0,t1_ckq5pvb,I have a lot of memories of being terribly hungover walking up this huge hill on my campus at am and listening to cleanse song...That made me smile haha through the summer just gone I did some work experience which meant getting up really early sometimes quite hungover and Cleanse Song really helped me get through that I can really relate.Back at university now about to get up out of bed and have We are No Where and Its Now playing. Cant really ever seem to handle mornings without some Oberst or Bright Eyes.And just to add I think my favourite album has to be Lifted but Ive listening to Wide Awake constantly for over a decade now and Light Pollution is almost enough alone for me to want to say Digital Ash. Collection of Songs is also up there. Its impossible to choose actually Im just going to copout and say I like all of them in different ways.Daamn how could I forget Fevers and Mirrors think that may have been the first album I ever heard on my sisters borrowed MP back in like ? That may actually have to be the favourite.,brighteyes,ckxasl4,1,t5_2sehm

9719773,0,t1_daafiyg,it was the best concert ive ever been to by far and ive been to quite a few great ones. awesome that you were in the front row! it was pretty calm and quiet but then again i dont have much to compare it to. hopefully one day ill be able to say ive seen him as many times as you. ,brighteyes,dab692d,2,t5_2sehm
