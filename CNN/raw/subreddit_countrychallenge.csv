2959309,0,t1_co4h5ku,It has. The peak alcohol consumption was in . It has gone down due to the global economic crisis and strengthened alcohol policies.When you look at the economic reports on import you also see an overall decline in alcoholic beverages import especially of strong alcohol.More subjectively speaking I also have the experience that in smaller towns people consume strong alcoholic beverages more frequently that people in bigger towns. So if youve moved in the recent years your opinion might be additionally affected due to a change in context. I lived in a smaller town for most of my life until moving to the capital. My own alcohol consumption drastically declined but I didnt notice this until I went back home after two years and saw my friends drinking vodka like it was some soft drink.,countrychallenge,co4hkk5,3,t5_320z9

3009080,0,t1_co9v05v,Thanks!  It does mean spanish. I have no idea why though. The baking process hasnt got anything to do with anything even remotely spanish except maybe the use of flour and an oven. The spandauer is pretty much the bread and butter of danish pastries.. As well as the snegl Every type of pastry is based off of the same basic dough recipe  water yeast flour sugar eggs and a bit of butter oil or margarine quickly kneaded and then folded with a huge lump of cold butter or margarine half of the weight of the dough should be butter or margarine. Mostly the butterdough is then cooled for practical purposes. Its important that it remains cool so that the yeast doesnt start its raising process. Its also much easier to work with when cool. Its then rolled and folded over itself three times so that we end up with  layers or butter or margarine. This is what makes the dough puff when we bake it. When thats done its then rolled into whatever length and width we want for the type of pastry were making. As I said the only difference is pretty much how its shaped and what kind of remonce is used. Its either simply sugar and margarine sugar margarine and marzipan or sugar cinnamon and margarine. Theres a visual guide to how its done here As for brunsviger and kagemand  sometimes we use brunsviger for kagemandpurpose and put candy on that as well. Its rather awesome if I may say so myself. ,countrychallenge,co9w0dt,2,t5_320z9
