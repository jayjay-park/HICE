2685467,0,t3_2qro0v,This is how mine fits. Just like yours I got a medium and it was too floppy. The small fits great. It takes some getting used to having it on. Just give it some time and see how it feels. I remember thinking that mine was too small but I dont notice it at all anymore! Hope this was helpful! ,Jawbone,cn93zpf,2,t5_2we1y
2845790,0,t1_cnrb9x1,Yes but thats for new orders. When I talked to Jawbone support they made it clear that their first priority will be fulfilling preorders followed by store shipments. Based on that Id go with guessing that  weeks estimate will be for phase two shipments.,Jawbone,cnrkdf0,1,t5_2we1y

3086347,0,t1_coc4v18,The Smart Coach is pretty helpful for me as well as the food score. The Smart Coach suggest goals such as eating more fiber per day. The food score is a number from  to  that helps you judge your eating habits. I dont know if it is actually true or not but I feel that the number system is based on what you have already eaten in the day. For example you get lower food score on food that will put you above your sodium threshold even if the food isnt necessarily unhealthy. ,Jawbone,cohwclm,1,t5_2we1y

3830199,0,t3_34alfx,Honestly I doubt it. It fully seems like a hardware issue. Its totally fucked. But Ive learned to live with it. Using the app to switch modes works fine and you can figure it out typically. But is it annoying and despicable that they would launch the product like this?

3868051,0,t3_33x0v5,Just upgraded from the first gen Up to this having similar tapping issues. Overall the device has been quite nice so far. I wish it would sync a little less often but thats not a huge issue as long as the battery life is there.About the tapping issue I found that if I just start tapping on the device rapidly up and down eventually it registers a tap or two. Two fingers didnt seem to work for me though touching it against my knee cap did. This things weird. P,Jawbone,cqx6wfm,1,t5_2we1y

4682095,0,t1_ctkpte9,I fully charged it two days ago and this morning when I checked my battery level while it was still working it said  days left. Ive redone the procedure and its left on the charger now. Well see if that helps I just need something to tide me over till the Amazon replacement gets shipped overnight tomorrow and so I know what to do when this happens again in a couple weeksmonths.

5579983,0,t3_3rjfdn,I own an UP but I am assuming it works the same way as the UP. Tapping was the method to switch states day mode sleep mode stopwatch mode on the band. A firmware update turned this feature that many people found unreliable off permanently. I am not sure why they make the red light respond to the double tap. Your guess to make sure it is still on is mine too. The stopwatch mode is used to log activities. On previous models which had a physical button it was a convenient way to know afterwards how long one where engaged on an activity.  After you stop it you can tell using the app the sort of activity and its intensity.,Jawbone,cwoqyrn,3,t5_2we1y
5785839,0,t1_cxe962x,I personally didnt think so. Im pretty healthy so I dont really know what extra value Id get from monitoring my heart rate so frequently. Plus you have to wear it a bit more snugly for the sensors which I didnt really like. ,Jawbone,cxeaeaq,1,t5_2we1y

6491694,0,t3_44ihq4,Im using an Apple watch for steps etc though you could use your phone and a Move for sleep tracking only. I have both blue and purple UP apps installed so everything syncs.The Move is pretty unkillable anyway as its a much more basic device.Also  the UP app will read extremely basic sleep data out of healthkit as thats all it can store really just sleep start and end times. You can use an app like Sleep Cycle to capture these from your nightstand without having to put your phone under your pillow or on your mattress.,Jawbone,czqsfvh,1,t5_2we1y

8742001,0,t1_d6yea18,I would agree except I didnt have a working up band for an entire year. They were back ordered when my up broke and it was about two months before I got a replacement.  I was expecting a little good faith even if im not legally in the right. Expecting me to buy another one when I didnt even get a years worth of total use seems a little rich. ,Jawbone,d6yehxe,1,t5_2we1y
9178562,0,t1_d8fepzq,Does yours even connect to your phone?  Mine only connects when its plugged it.  I assumed mine had no battery to begin with.  In the support material Jawbone says it may be solid orange for  minutes if it had zero charge.  Who knows if its the firmware or updating the firmware in that  minute time span that did it.  I put in a support request.  Im barely within  year warranty and I hope they honor that.,Jawbone,d8fg7b6,1,t5_2we1y
