8707994,0,t3_4z7jcs,Hi yall! My name is Julie. I am from Baltimore MD so I loved Rachels old vlogs of going to the aquarium!!! but I have recently been dividing my time between there and DC because of work and school. My fave food network show is Chopped for obvious reasons but I am also a sucker for insert name Baking Championships that they have year round because it is lighthearted drama and I have an overwhelming sweet tooth.,CoffeeWithChrachel,d6u4v2a,5,t5_3fzvw

8977296,0,t3_538q9e,whats yalls response on the whole buzzfeeds what does a queer popstar look like in  article on halsey. its a lengthy piece but buzzfeed basically analyzes her past year and says shes gotten more straight as shes garnered more attention in the public. the author is an LGBT editor and mostly touches on the lack of female love interests in halseys songs and videos but even goes as far as looking into the singers social life and how she dresses saying her recent VMAs outfit was the most feminine look yet..i get that the author is trying to bring attention to how heteronormative pop culture can be but i think it was ultimately a super biphobicbierasing article ,CoffeeWithChrachel,d7qxnr4,2,t5_3fzvw

9947162,0,t3_5hwiy5,Sorry to hear youre dealing with that  I definitely know the feeling. Something other than meditationyoga that helps me is to take a hot shower and really palmer myself. Shave moisturize do a face mask etc. Make myself a comforting snack tea coffee. And then watch a ridiculous cartoon or movie that will be distracting. It helps to ground myself and calm my mind. Definitely give it a try if you think it would help ,CoffeeWithChrachel,db452gu,3,t5_3fzvw
