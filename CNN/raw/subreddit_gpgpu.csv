That will get you the best sense of how much you could gain.Also remember that youve got a four stage NUMA here.  Access times are about an order of magnitude each stage you go up so private is about x faster than local which is about x faster than global.  Moving things across the PCIe buss is about x slower than global memory access on average that one varies a lot.The other thing to remember is that branches are the death of performance on GPUs.  Each branch means that you have to run both sides of the branch in serial so you double your runtime with every branch unless you are very sure one of those branches will be empty.,gpgpu,cnf3et9,2,t5_2rgkm
