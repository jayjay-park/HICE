645493,0,t1_cg6kov0,gt Historically the hero is one who has literally or figuratively come back from the dead and thus achieved victory over death.gt Cults and religions were an attempt to attain an immunity bath from the greatest evil death and the dread of it through such promises as resurrection and reincarnation. Taking another tack Buddhism and Hinduism made being reborn a flaw convincing followers that rebirth is a kind of failure. Im calling bullshit here. First of all the symbolic death of the hero as I understand it represents the breaking of the selfobject passing through the fire of selfrealization where illusion is burned away and overcoming the fear of death not death itself.Secondly while I agree with his point about religions and cults providing comfort in the face of the Void Becker is off the mark with regards to Buddhism. The first of Buddhisms Four Noble Truths is Life is suffering which is more accurately understood to mean that life is impermanent and that clinging to impermanence causes suffering Dukkha. Dukkha implies impermanence conditioned states roughly infinite cause and effect and suffering. Enlightenment comes when one relinquishes ones suffering over attachment to impermanent and conditioned states and lives as a liberated being satori. Its another form of the heros symbolic deathbreaking of the selfobject. Becker goes on to say that Buddhism and Hinduism attempt a sleightofhand where they convince adherents that rebirth is undesirable but if one has has become aware that life is suffering has broken the selfobject and is living in a liberated state the return to conditioned existence Samsara and suffering IS CLEARLY undesirable dammit.  ,bestofthefray,cgdn5dg,1,t5_2rm3u
646177,0,t1_cg6o8er,Mans Existential DilemmaSince reading TKs response to Chapter Four I do think Becker is engaging in hyperbole here Character traits are secret psychosis. Stating that man is necessarily mad diminishes the importance and psychological soundness of responding appropriately to ones environment.If I put what hes saying in a Buddhist context it helps me to reconcile it Man is born into terror. Our ancestors lived nasty brutal and short lives in an environment that was naturally red in tooth and claw but they could contemplate the stars. That must have sucked. Does it suck less now that we live relatively long lives in relative comfort and abundance and safety? Nope. Were still clinging clinging clinging. And clinging is the source of our misery. gt As the child piles up experience and develops a sense of self he is overwhelmed by the dualism of self and body. His symbolic self is not yet cohesive and organized and he doesnt have bodily autonomy or the ability to function in the world by himself.Becker is staying close to Freud and his detractors at the expense of a sound argument. He does this through much of the book.gt We become mad existing behind masks of equanimity and happiness of sanity pretending not to be mad. This madness becomes evil when we wreak destruction on the world in support of our personal theater of a whole ordered self.  Looking past the hyperbole Beckers point here is that when peoples hero projects are accomplished at the expense of others the results are evil. I have no argument with that. The Meaning of Anality Again hes using Freuds model as a springboard. Its interesting but its just a model. There are some good survivaloriented reasons that bodily excretions are treated with disgust and aversion. Most of them are fairly dangerous to our health. I dont know if I buy the whole deal about the childs fascination with feces as an attempt to control death and decay. Children are fascinated by everything. I bet the kid smearing his shit on the wall beside his crib isnt afraid of spiders yet either. The Oedipal ProjectI find all of this a reach except the part about the childs narcissistic drive to become the father of himself to separate from the parents. The rest of it just seems shoehorned into Freuds model. Its interesting and not without merit but its just a model. The Castration Complex Both boys and girls turn away from the mother as a sort of automatic reflex of their own needs for growth and independence.Other than this Im not really buying any of it. The Primal Scene I can see how a child might be traumatized by seeing his parents in the act of copulation  in the repressive culture of Victorian England. Certainly he was receiving a mixed message.Im somewhat persuaded with regards to adult fixations on the body and perversions being an attempt to overcome existential anxiety through the use or misuse of the body. Becker gets into this more deeply in later chapters.,bestofthefray,cgdpy66,1,t5_2rm3u
673888,0,t1_cgguxy6,The bimanual exam being a necessary component of the surgery I dont see the need for discussion beyond any other part of the procedure.

697432,0,t1_cgjjsap,Chapter   Part Instead of working with the material of his introversions the neurotic exhausts himself not only in selfpreoccupations like hypochondriacal fears and all sorts of fantasies but also in others those around him on whom he is dependent become his therapeutic work project he takes out his subjective problems on them. But people dont easily submit to being used in such a way. The neurotics frustration as a failed artist cant be remedied by anything but an objective creative work of his own.gt It is obvious that the only way to work on perfection is in the form of an objective work that is fully under your control and is perfectible in some real ways. Either you eat up yourself and others around you trying for perfection or you objectify that imperfection in a work on which you then unleash your creative powers. In this sense some kind of objective creativity is the only answer man has to the problem of life. In this way he satisfies nature which asks that he live and act objectively as a vital animal plunging into the world but he also satisfies his own distinctive human nature because he plunges in on his own symbolic terms and not as a reflex of the world as given to mere physical sense experience. Criticizing himself to excess the neurotic can only satisfy his heroic urge his need to glorify himself through fantasy but one cannot justify his own heroism in his own inner symbolic fantasy which is what leads the neurotic to feel more unworthy and inferior.The categories were discussing here are somewhat interchangeable. Artists can be quite neurotic with crippling neurotic symptoms that can cripple those around them as well by their neurotic demands and needs.gt There is no doubt that the creative work is itself done under a compulsion often indistinguishable from a purely clinical obsession. In this sense what we call a creative gift is merely a social license to be obsessed.The Problem of Illusiongt We have looked at neurosis as a problem of character and have seen that it can be approached in two ways as a problem of too much narrowness toward the world or of too much openness But it is very risky to try to be hard and fast about types of personality there are all kinds of blends and combinations that defy precise compartmentalization Even if the average man lives in a kind of obliviousness of anality it is because he has erected a massive wall of repressions to his the problem of life and death. His anality may protect him but all through history it is the normal average men who like locusts have laid waste to the world in order to forget themselves.This combination of normalcy and neurosis can be viewed as a question of reality and illusion. Weve examined how what we call human character is actually a lie about the nature of reality and noted that the causasui project is a pretense that one is invulnerable because protected by the power of others and of culture that one is important in nature and can do something about the world. gt But in the back of the causasui project whispers the voice of possible truth that human life may not be more than a meaningless interlude in a vicious drama of flesh and bones that we call evolution.The man who accepts cultural life as truth can go about his days secure in the belief that he is earning his immortality under the dominant immortality ideology. But the man who is not able to accept the lie of cultural life cannot banish existential terror from consciousness.Rankgt He perceives himself as unreal and reality as unbearable because with him the mechanisms of illusion are know and destroyed by selfconsciousness. He can no longer deceive himselfand perceives himself as bad guilt laden inferior as a small weak helpless creature which is the truth about mankind All other is illusion deception but necessary deception in order to be able to bear ones self and thereby life.The neurotic cannot engage with others or with their illusions about life. He cannot participate in their deceptions about the human condition and so isolates himself from the natural therapy of everyday life. Unlike the artist he cannot create new illusions. If it is true as Rank says that man cannot live without illusions it absolutely shakes the foundations of our conceptualization of normality and health. It makes them entirely a relative value problem. The neurotic opts out of life because he is having trouble maintaining his illusions about it which proves nothing less than that life is possible only with illusions.So the question becomes On what level of illusion does one live?... There is a great deal of falseness and selfdeception in the causasui project but there is also the necessity of this project if one is going to be of healthy mind. gt Man needs a second world a world of humanly created meaning a new reality that he can live dramatize nourish himself in. Illusion means creative play at its highest level. Cultural illusion is a necessary ideology of selfjustification a heroic dimension that is life itself to the symbolic animal.Neurosis as HistoricalThe historical aspect of neurosis is the most important of all because it absorbs the others. Neurosis as firstly a problem of character and secondly a problem of illusion merges in the historical context because history is a succession of immortality ideologies and the problems of men can be read directly against those ideologies.gt What characterizes modern life is the failure of all traditional immortality ideologies to absorb and quicken mans hunger for selfperpetuation and heroism. Neurosis is today a widespread problem because of the disappearance of convincing dramas of heroic apotheosis of man Modern man cannot find his heroism in everyday life any more as men did in traditional societies just by doing their daily duty of raising children working and worshipping When he dethroned the idea of soul and God he was thrown back hopelessly on his own resources on himself and those few around him.According to Rank man became psychological man when he became isolated from protective collective ideologies. His justification for his life could no longer be found outside of himself but had to come from within. The dismantling by th century scientists of the Church as the foundation for society and culture was a victory for science but according to Rank it raised more problems than it solved. gt Science thought that it had gotten rid of forever the problems of the soul by making the inner world the subject of scientific analysis but it could not solve the mystery of the meaning of organismic awareness The hysterical reactions of th century believers against Darwin only shows the thinness and unimaginativeness of their faith when Darwin stripped them of their sense of special wondrousness they felt as good as dead.Scientific psychology changed the soul into the self and the self into the early conditioning of the child leaving only individual man and you are stuck with him. Psychology sought to solve the problem of happiness for man by showing him the causes of things and all he had to do was to take possession of the domain of nature including his own nature and his happiness would be assured. In the process psychology took from man the theological explanation for why he was inferior bad and guilty and although its scientific explanations solve part of the problem of mans selfloathing it also narrows the cause for personal unhappiness down to the person himself and then he is stuck with himself. This does nothing to alleviate the suffering that man experiences as a symbolic animal trying to comprehend his existence in the natural world.gt All the analysis in the world doesnt allow the person to find out who he is and why he is here on earth why he has to die and how he can make his life a triumph. It is when psychology pretends to do this when it offers itself as a full explanation of human unhappiness that it becomes a fraud that makes the situation of modern man an impasse from which he cannot escape. ,bestofthefray,cgjjtn0,1,t5_2rm3u
761493,0,t1_cgqtbj5,Caper read over our conversation and youll see Im not playing word games. Your definition of knowledge is ridiculous I just went with it because I didnt want to quibble. Basically the problem is you dont appear to know the difference between knowledge and facts. Facts are always true or false. Knowledge isnt. Calling what Ive said word games is rhetoric though. Which is ironic but hardly unexpected.And on the broader point  philosophers dont really ever do word games. If an argument is revealed to be solely persuasive due to some trick of language its generally fatal to that argument. I think its a bit of a tragedy that people dont pay more attention to philosophy today simply because it gives you the skills you can use to identify biases tricks of rhetoric and methodological blindspots. Although its always interesting to me that people are actively hostile to philosophy. I think its telling like if someone was actively hostile to history.Philosophers are like the theory equivalent of programmers. Most people use a program every day but very few know how it works or what else the code could be used for. Similarly people use theory all the time and most people are happy to be casual users. However sometimes therell be problems where you need a new program a new theory to deal with a new problem. Sometimes people get so comfortable with their programs that they hardly realize theyre using programs at all. The same happens with theory. People get so comfortable in their methods of organizing reality that they think those methods are reality. But thats a bit like elderly computer users who think their browser is the internet or that MS Paint is the only imageediting program. Its not fatal but it is deeply limiting.,bestofthefray,cgqu69p,2,t5_2rm3u

That car started the muscle car era.But the actual greatest ever davetos thread was anything with a genuine gen Chrysler Hemi. For insurance purposes those things were modestly rated at  HP even after S.A.E. rules changed from gross to net but pumped out over  HP off the showroom floor and  with simple boltons. Relatively simple internal modifications like a race cam would net over  HP more than a contemporary Bugatti Veron. Modern dragsters using essentially the same engine are near  HP.Most of those astonishing powerplants went in midsize Chrysler B bodies such the Plymouth Road Runner and Dodge Super Bee. A very few went into compact Valiants which had only a couple years earlier been branded Barracudas and fitted with a  cubic inch V.
