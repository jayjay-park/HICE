A series does not make a game inherently better or worse.Again never called them horrible dont know where you are getting it from. I just think they are bad.I am not going to review these games for you sorry. I think I provided ample reasons but I can give you a couple more if you want. The character design is awful. Like late s tude in . A bunch of Dreamworksface. It is very unappealing and hard to look at it. You could say the same about the Skylanders series but at least that has more polished gameplay. The monsterriding gets old very fast and there isnt a lot of variety in what you can actually do rather it is implied by different creatures. I think collectionbased open world platformers were REALLY tired by . Hell these are Wii games we are talking about. It did nothing to take the genre to new heights like Mario Galaxy did. Instead it almost seemed like a regression to the Rare platformers of the N. I can keep going on but I dont think youre actually listening.,crashbandicoot,d0cjl95,0,t5_2tgip

8027948,0,t3_4p2dp5,At first by favourite track I thought you meant song... Well done me.Favourite  probably Cortex Castle and funnily enough it is influenced by the song as well. Its a really varied track and also one where it feels  to me personally anyhow   the most rewarding track to play once youve mastered boosting as it feels like your momentum continues very fluidly if you judge it right. Sewer Speedway is absolutely awesome as well.Least favourite  maybe Tiny Arena? It feels the hardest to keep your momentum on and feels too tight and claustrophobic.

The voice isnt awful just out of place for those of us that have known Crash for years.That being said if they plan on moving the franchise forward I hope that Crash will not be a permanent part of skylanders. I adore the Thumpin Wumpa Islands levels and the figures but Crash has so much more potential than that. In my perfect world I hope that Sony would try to push Crash as a semimascot again and his appearance in Skylanders was just to hold us over until they do so. Of course he could absolutely be both a skylanders character and have his own new games but I would much rather go down the path of new games than being a permanent addition to skylanders.,crashbandicoot,d9ceeg1,8,t5_2tgip

11127585,0,t3_5yuv5y,Looking at the hang eight footage it seems the camera is lot lower than the original. The original has the camera mostly closer to a birdseyeview of Crash.Is this something to do with it being widescreen or is this an artistic choice? I kind of prefer the original view where you couldnt see too far into the distance. It makes it more challenging.,crashbandicoot,detaw5a,4,t5_2tgip

11175080,0,t1_dexfe6u,Okay obviously the original voice actors are going to sound somewhat better than the new ones but thats because of nostalgia.But I mean come on Lex is doing an awesome job so far. No one thinks Clancy is better than Lex or Lex is better than Clancy. Theyre both great at portraying Cortex in the appropriate setting.You can tell the director is really doing an outstanding job trying to match their voices to the original.,crashbandicoot,deyolbq,2,t5_2tgip

11180855,0,t1_dey66oa,Yeah it would be great if you could access every level without quitting. I would love to see a fully interconnected map. You could maybe make the Crash  warp room connect to the top of the final island in Crash  I believe the individual warp rooms were actually islands themselves and then have the secret warp room for Crash  accessible as the th level of the Crash  warp room and then give that warp room the ability to ascend into the Crash  time twister after you complete the game and the platform could rise once more to take you to the secret warp room.That would make the total map  islands and  levels total with the main time twister of Crash  counting as a single level that you could easily switch between. They could even make it so the LR buttons let you instantly choose between all  options laid out in a  x  grid with  on the top  in the middle and  centered on the bottom.,crashbandicoot,dezc5lo,3,t5_2tgip

11769063,0,t1_dgtgjwt,I dont think appreciation of the vehicle levels comes down to nostalgia. Whenever some drops that word that is when someone is being offensive and shortsighted. Some people are just a bit more open minded about variety in their gameplay. I have seen other people say they would prefer new entries in the franchise to stick to the classic .D levels. That will kill the franchise going forward. Crash needs to evolve. People here dont give Naughty Dog enough credit for their effort and the risks they took back in the day. Warped is a masterpiece of a platformer and the rest of the outside world agrees and that has nothing to do with nostalgia.
