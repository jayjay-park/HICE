1624293,0,t1_cjjwh1y,Not sure I agree with you that a light  has no recoil. They recoil more than they should. And its sharper recoil than ga. Also a heavier gun is easier to shoot at targets. Its not just about recoil. Youll overpower a light gun and whip it all over the place whereas the inertia and momentum of a heavy gun keeps everything smooth and under control. For skeet ga is fine no handicap at all but its not the first choice for trap. TLDR A ga is probably too much of a compromise as a doitall gun. ,Shotguns,cjjwong,4,t5_2swt0

1767100,0,t1_ck1vjwv,Theres no question that you can shoot any gun you want.  That doesnt mean you should shoot any gun.  Thats the caveat.  If the kid is getting involved in a trap league that means his score counts.  If youre going to keep score you might as well do it the right way.  Go to any serious trap tournament and you will only see ga guns.  While a ga gun really isnt much of a handicap its not quite the same as shooting a ga gun and theres no reason to handcuff yourself when youre trying to do your best.  Take a look at the NSSA average tables and youll see that there is a meaningful difference in the gauges.  And thats for skeet.  The difference for trap will be larger because of the longer target distances.Like Skeet with a Mod choke.  It can be done.  I know.  I do it from time to time when Im too lazy to change chokes.  But when youre keeping score is it really the best practice to throw out a pattern from a Mod choke thats half as big as the pattern from a Skeet choke?  Thats making the game needlessly harder when youre trying to do your best against other people who are using Skeet chokes and taking every advantage available under the rules.Again if youre just out having fun do anything you want.  Im taking my ga BPS out to the club this weekend to shoot sporting clays.  But when the its tournament time and I need to keep score its the ga K that comes out of the safe.TLDR Subgauge is an unecessary handicap when keeping score.,Shotguns,ck1wdfd,1,t5_2swt0

2778374,0,t3_2rwd1z,You bought new production Remington. I could leave at that but I wont.You probably have a problem with your shell latches the two pieces of metal that are on the insides of the receiver along the bottom. They work in combination with tabs on the action bars to release shells from the mag tube as you move the bars via pulling on the forearm. How to fix them? They might be bent out of shape not properly staked in place or just cut wrong.I would seriously consider taking it back to the store if you can. If you cant do that inquire about getting service by Remington. Once you realize that might just be more time wasted see if a gunsmith can take a look at it and fix it. And finally when you hear how much the gunsmith is going to charge you for parts and labor sell it on Gunbroker and either buy a Mossberg  a Weatherby or an old  Wingmaster.Todays lesson was Why we dont buy new production Remington anything.,Shotguns,cnjw419,8,t5_2swt0

Guns are made to be shot if you got a nice one put it to work.  How small of upland birds are we talking?  With a bit of practice you should be able to clip the head of a grouse or standing rabbit with the full choke.  Set up a board figure out your shot pattern with preferred ammo.You are right about steel shot through a full choke though.  Honestly Id just get yourself another barrel with a threaded end for interchangeable choke tubes.  Then you can shoot anything you want.  Make sure you get a wingmaster barrel though so the finish matches up nice.  Shouldnt have problems with compatibility of newer barrel vs your .  EDIT Im not too sure about putting  through your receiver even if you get a barrel that can take .  I think the answer is no but this depends on your serial . Check this thread Theres a bit of misinformation but this post is most relevantThe serial number on the receiver will end in in a letterM is a  g receiver for N is a g standard size receiver for U is a g small frame receiver for H is a  receiver for Everything else should only be used with   shells regardless of what it says on the chamber of the barrel that happens to be installed on it at the time.These barrels interchange easily and jlptexashunter is correct you may find a   receiver with a  chambered barrel installed in that case ONLY   shells should be used.This can be a serious issue I know of at least one gun that develpoed a cracked receiver at the rear of the ejector port because the owner thought it was OK to fire  shells in a   receivered gun.  ,Shotguns,cxf8h5t,2,t5_2swt0

5956616,0,t3_3wypnl,Theyre generally pretty great. There were some bad spanish guns made in the ss but anything imported since the s is likely to be decent. The way Spanish guns are made takes pretty extensive hand fitting and finishing which has its upsides and downsides. In general they will handle more lively and are lighter than anything American or Japanese made.   Think superposed vs citori  hard to quantify but its a balance thing. The downsides  parts arent interchangeable between guns without some fitting even if they are identical make and model. The other thing is I think the prices have gotten a bit out of hand in the lasy while especially new. If you can find an AOC or Lion Country Uggie itll generally be pretty solid. I wouldnt pay much over . If offered an Uggie or an AyA id take the one that fit better.

6247448,0,t3_40ub6x,This was the choice I was faced with when buying my shotgun. I only have one. I would recommend renting each of them and shooting a couple  rounds. Theyre very different.The  is much lighter and feels more pointable to me from a carry position. I went upland bird hunting with it and shot some pheasants and chukar. It came right up and shot where I pointed. The recoil is noticeable but lighter than some of the other OU Ive shot. Manufacturingwise and totally qualitatively it doesnt seem as nice as I think it should at its price point. The engraving looks particularly cheap to meId rather have none. I believe it was about  or so. I took a pass.The A feels heavier and less pointable to me. I dont know if it is in fact any heavier. Its the same length as the s I shot. I paid  for mine used in great condition with a bunch of Briley extras and  aftermarket chokes. It feels nicer than its price. It gets attention at the range and people always say thats a great gun isnt it. Recoil is negligible. Nevertheless it has a bit of a RoboCop feel to me with the blue receiver. Im not sure how well thats going to age aesthetically. It isnt as easy to clean as an OU but it runs great dirty and isnt really that hard to clean. Ive probably got  rounds through mine now.Personally Im glad I bought the A. Trigger time is whats going to make a difference in my shootingthis is my first seasonand the lack of recoil makes it easy to just shoot and shoot and shoot. Ive shot a bunch of trap and skeet premounted and some sporting clays. I will probably buy an OU in the future for  reasons  . The A doesnt feel quite as pointable which is helpful for sporting clays and . I want an heirloom piece in my collection.Have tried a bunch of OU up to the k range and have not found one that Im willing to buy yet. The Beretta  is really really nice and a strong maybe.

A Beretta  or a Browninhg Citori would be a good choice.gtwould anyone buytrade a gun with a broken ejector extension or will I have to get it fixed anywayYes but theyre going to make you pay for it.  gtif I get it fixed should I take it to an actual gunsmithYes.  Parts ejectors have to be handfitted and synced.  Theres more to it than just dropping one in.  To that end if your gunsmith can make totally badass ARs and went to the Glock armory school find a different gunsmith.gthas anyone on here put screw in chokes in a SuperposedNot personally but  know enough about them to know that youre probably going to have a hard time getting any kind of choke tubes in a SKSK super.  The gunsmith needs metal to create the threading and youre not going to have much there with SKSK.  Briley makes thinwalled choke tubes for applications like this.  By thin they mean if you drop the tube on a tile floor youll need to buy a new tube.  Theyre that thin.  Even if you do get choke tubes installed you still cannot use steel shot in this gun.  The brazing between the barrels cannot handle the strain that steel puts on the tubes.  ,Shotguns,d1oo8zj,8,t5_2swt0

If youre using the gun for clays doves and some light waterfowl hunting you should easily get  rounds through it before you need to take it apart for a good cleaning.  Honestly you can run a pump until it starts acting up without hurting much.  Your magazine follower and your shell carrier will tell you when its time to deep clean your gun.  Of course you need to wipe it down put a drop of lube on the rails and keep the barrel clean but the rest of the parts dont need much service at all.The irritating part about new Browning guns is the amount of cosmolene in it out of the box.  Practically speaking you need to deep clean the gun before you shoot it for the first time.  But then it should be good to go for several years.,Shotguns,d7w287q,1,t5_2swt0

Failure to eject and stovepiping can be common. This is pretty common problem with any inertia gun.Follow the breakin procedure. Shoot  to  rounds of field loads before trying lighter target loads. Then you will probably need to function test a few different brands of target loads to find one that is best for your gun.And sadly Rio probably wont be the brand. Of the half dozen or so Stoegers Ive shot not one would reliably cycle with Rios. Look for target shells that have a bit more velocity than the standard fps.  to fps seem to provide enough umpoof to run inertia guns consistently.Enjoy your new shotgun!,Shotguns,dcpoltj,1,t5_2swt0
