3706711,0,t1_cqeno6q,gtIve some added joy i.e. tinfoil fuel from World of Thedas Vol.  posted on rdragonage and cherry picked here.gtThe now banned by the Chantry Canticle of Silencegtpage page page page OMG I KNOW!!I saw the first three pages last night and then today I read that different people may see different pages so I went over to Amazon to check it out and mine was missing the first two pages from the Canticle of Silence but it had the FOURTH page that the other posted was MISSING in which the Magisters actually enter the Golden City! That picture of the fourth page is actually the picture I uploaded PgtThe Maker flat out refers to the Old Gods as his first children. Man Ive got goosebumps just reading this. In my head cannon theyve gone from a somewhat generic ancient evil to the spurned in their minds and jealous first children of the maker.Well yes but dont get up excited... he actually refers to all spirits and whatever in the Fade as being his first children... besides we know that Bioware will never confirm or disprove in any way whether or not the Maker is actually real... so its unlikely we can use any dialog or quotes attributed to the Maker as any real evidence. Its likely there as a narrativestorytelling device not a literal recounting of what was said by whom. And besides how the hell would anyone really know the subjects or details of these conversations in the first place? Also the Canticle of Silence is not actually banned as in illegal or forbidden it is just a dissident verse meaning it is no longer acceptedtaughtincluded in the Chant of Light. Because so much of The Chantry and Thedas lore in general is based on actual history I think its worth mentioning that there are similar realworld examples of this in Christianity too. There were numerous gospels about or related to Jesus in the early days of Christianity but there was little consistency from one city or region to the next in what was taught and accepted so the early church eventually held a council with religious figures from all over that convened examined all of the various texts in circulation and collectively decided which texts were to be accepted and which were not in theory they were not accepted because they were found to be false... but many biblical scholars believe that there may have texts containing true elements and teachings but were not accepted because they went against or contradicted elements ideas or practices common in the church. See the Gospel of Thomas as an example of one which attributed several quotes to Jesus that appear to contradict the establishment of the church and it is one my favorites of these noncanonical texts because it had no fall narrativeonly short often somewhat cryptic conversations between him and his disciplesand makes no claim to his divinity nor his death. It is possibly the closest truest record of what academics calls the historical Jesus and it does seem to be the kind of teaching that you would expectdivine or notfrom an enlightened spiritual teacher and leader.Another good example is the Gospel of Judas which tells the story of his betrayal of Jesus and says Judas is visited by an angel the night before telling him he must betray Jesus. When Judas objects because the Romans will Jesus if he does this the angel tells him that he must because Jesus sacrifice will cleanse mankind of his sin and that he has to die before he can be resurrected and take him place in heaven or something... so Judas reluctantly complies. This was most likely rejected because by this time in history Judas was already wellvilified by the church and to suddenly have to retract that position and say well... you know what...  Judas wasnt actually this terrible person after all... he actually was only doing it because that was the divine will and it was very very difficult for him... wasnt what they really wanted to do. Besides Varric will tell you every story needs a good betrayal.So yeah... The Canticle of Silence isnt banned or anythingmany scholars still study itit just isnt an official part of the Chant of Light or the Chantrys teachings anymore. Although WoT says that it was at one time but later removed from the texts as accepted canon... most likely because it conflicted with what they wanted to believe that all of Tevinter was involved and responsible not just the seven Magisters working in secret. ,ThedasLore,cqesgp2,2,t5_374uj
3820397,0,t1_cqrmekd,I went of the existence of red Lyrium in the primeval thaig which out dated the first blight. So Im thinking that if red Lyrium is blighted and the primeval thaig outdated the first blight  even according to shaperate memories then quite possibly red Lyrium was the original source of the blight  or at least it was the first thing to catch it. ,ThedasLore,cqrr8sn,2,t5_374uj
3833381,0,t3_348a5r,Thank you all for the insight and lore facts.   It does seem more likely and far simpler that he just is FenHarel. Raises another question though did he have something real for Lavellan or was it all just a game to him? I mean he does say it was real but how far does FenHarels trickery go?  Is there any lore on what he has done other than locking away all of the other Gods somewhat deceitfully. For the record I do truly believe he meant well by it and he somewhat did what he told them he was going to do just not how the Gods expected Im sure. The Forgotten Ones surrendered because they were sealed away and the Gods were defeated because they can do nothing in their banishment as far as we know. I dont really see that as bad however that is pretty much the extent of my knowledge on FenHarel. In the end Ill just have to assume he did truly have feelings for her or it may be one disappointing fic hehe. Whatever you guys can teach me would be awesome. D,ThedasLore,cqt8lub,1,t5_374uj
4034710,0,t1_crg6j14,I can definitely see the Vints experimenting on Elves.  Did they create a major threat to themselves on accident or was there a purpose I wonder?  I think I completed one mosaic since I was playing without a guide.  ,ThedasLore,crg6rdq,1,t5_374uj
4134131,0,t1_crree2n,Is there not usually an implied or else whenever anyone says You better be?  A close reading of You better be denotes it as a phrase that implies consequences with better being superior to an implied inferior alternative. ,ThedasLore,crrigpz,1,t5_374uj
4819286,0,t1_cu1z2f0,Some are bound to leave others cant some dont want to some may not see it as an option. I get the feeling that people often fail to realte to the real world when posing questions here. Why didnt X do Y when Z  Well why dont people do that in real life?Why dont people in impoverished areas just leave them for better ones? People in less developed countries leave for industrialized nations? A million little factors. ,ThedasLore,cu20e3t,1,t5_374uj
5152678,0,t3_3lf91s,So I think there is good support for a lot of this e.g. the pictures of what look like titans in trespasser. I suppose the tenuous bits I would consider needing more support isthe origin of the Forgitten ones  if the are dangerous seems odd that they spawn from pacifists?Why this the elves had to flee bit. We know they left the deep roads but could that not have been after the veil was created and their society collapsed?also this broke the camels back bit  I thought the drawings in tresspasser just showed elves treated abominably badly and Solas set up a place for them to flee to rather than an event spawning everything?As an aside amp tin foil bit  spoilers? if we use the data mined information Solas was asleep for  years since he last awakened and he made the veil about  years ago. So assuming the data file is not a mis type he has woken up at some point prior.,ThedasLore,cv739e9,2,t5_374uj
5790075,0,t1_cxc28ie,There are two mentions during the game one the war table operation stop war between Nevarra and Tevinter the conflict is stopped and a second when Josie asks the inquisitor to pick a side.Ive been reading about Nevarra King Marcuss death seems imminent in Inquisition. The country is said to have been ruled by his Mortalitasi advisors and his successor is not clear. There are two big families who could fight for the throne which would mean civil war in Nevarra but it is implied that a third family could rise. If that is the case expansion is possible follow me instead Ill give you lands specially if Tevinter is having important internal issues.,ThedasLore,cxetasa,3,t5_374uj
6274665,0,t1_cz2mcgr,I imagine that uAndrewJacksonsBalls is using these codex entries to support claims  each of which deals with the interactions between ancient elves and the titans.  The first codex alludes to attacks on Elvhenan by the Titans Give us victory over the Earth that shakes our cities and pleads with Elgarnan to help us tame the land.The next codex entry covers what I believe is the Evanuris preparing magics to destroy the titans briefly mentioning the titans workers describing them as witless and soulless.  I believe as do many others that the titans workers are in fact ancient dwarves though they probably more closely resemble the ShaBrytol than modern dwarves.  Whatever they are it is clear that the elves or at least the Evanuris as no sympathy for them and intend to wipe them out to claim the land for Elvhenan.  The final codex entry is split into two sections.  The first extols the triumph of Mythal over the titans claiming that she has struck down the pillars of the earth and rendered their demesne unto the People.  The rune then displays the image of fearful elves sealing the Deep Roads and another voice claims that What the Evanuris in their greed could unleash would end us all.  Now we dont know what exactly the Evanuris did reveal be it the darkspawn scaled ones red lyrium or some other horror yet to be seen in the games.  The last lines of the codex seem to imply that whatever the Evanuris awakenedactivateddisrupted down there led to the destruction of Elvhenan by civil war.  Perhaps Solas or his followers were the ones responsible for sealing the Deep Roads and what he saw may have been the straw that broke the camels back.,ThedasLore,cz2ux4h,3,t5_374uj
7093467,0,t1_d1ket7d,Well I think that at this point everything was discussed several times here on rdragonage or BSN forums. There is not much to discuss anymore since we have no new source of lore. I too love discussing it but you know DA has to land first.,ThedasLore,d1kewbx,5,t5_374uj
9024324,0,t3_53qx1h,Mm. The problem with this theory is that the Kossith came from another land they didnt originate in Thedas. The little information we actually have on the Fex seems to imply that they wereare from Thedas. Also on the wikia it mentions that the Fex are still on Por Vollen. This makes it seem like the Qunari probably found a place for them in the Qun. ,ThedasLore,d7wkz5i,4,t5_374uj
10714246,0,t3_55q0ml,What about the reverse? What if the dragons were the ones being experimented on. Or if the dragons are an earlier experiment ands the qunari are the later? I honestly dont have a clue yet but maybe. ,ThedasLore,ddl3ezy,1,t5_374uj
