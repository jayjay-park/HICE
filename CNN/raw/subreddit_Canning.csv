2521,0,t3_1u4fi5,sigh  One of the BEST resources for practical canning information on the web is Jackie Clay at Backwoodshome.comRelevant to this discussionJackieCan you home can pesto? I assume that you can since you can buy it in cans at the store but I dont know the processing time. I have canned baba ghanooj and so on when overseas but didnt know if there was a trick with pesto.NadineAnything you find canned in the store can be home canned but several items such as pesto will not be found in your home canning manuals. The only reason I would not recommend canning pesto is that it is so much better made fresh with basils from your own herb bed. Those delicate flavors will not be as perfect if you can it which of course must subject it to heat.But if you want to can it Id recommend using halfpint jars you dont want leftovers. Using your favorite recipetypically basil peeled cloves of garlic and olive oil crushed well togetherpack it into clean jars to within half an inch of the top. Wipe the rim place a previously boiled warm lid in place and screw down ring firmly tight. Process at  pounds pressure adjust the pressure upward for higher altitudes check your canning manual for  minutes. ,Canning,ceeq484,1,t5_2re2w

159628,0,t3_1vwqtb,Heres what happened Part of the initial boiling with the water helps to soften cell walls and make them more accepting to sugar throughout the entire peel. This is why you blanch citrus peel before you candy it.  When you added the sugar too early it forced its way into the exposed cell walls on the edge then created a roadblock for further absorption. Thats why they never got tender no matter how much you boiled! It seemed counter intuitive you boiled longer so they should be getting softer but the exact opposite was happening. If you hadnt scorched the pot you might have been able to salvage some orange candy from it if you dry it overnight and dip it in chocolate it would probably have been delicious.

1512836,0,t3_2bh5r9,You actually dont want to pressure can  a lot of things like jam pickles fruits and things that are normally water bath canned. I do use my pressure canner as a water bath canner when water bath canning because I dont want to have two canners taking up space. Also pressure canning takes a lot longer than water bath and it will cook some things at too high of a temperature and will destroy and  burn them. You should really only pressure can low acid foods that require it but you can use your pressure canner as a water bath so long as you can get enough water in the pressure canner over the jars mine is an all American and is plenty tall enough for both processes. ,Canning,cj5ws9j,2,t5_2re2w

When I started canningI was very nervous about it all but its fun and easy and theres a lot of great safe recipes out there though be cautious what websites you trust..Ive only had seal failures on a couple things which I mostly attribute to siphoning during the sealing process.these were easily noticeable because my jars are stored without rings so the loose lid was obvious.

4514623,0,t3_3cwiwa,Disclaimer  most of my Vacola knowledge is form helping my mother rather than use on my own. Invest in new lids to replace the ones with any rust on the inside. They are not that expensive compared to the jars.  You will be able keep reusing the new ones you get until they also go rusty. You can get the standard tin plated ones for  a dozen or for a little more you can get stainless steel ones which will last longer.. The clips being rusty is less of an issue because as you note they dont contact the food. As long as they still have enough spring to clamp tight.. Technically the rings are single use. The risk of reuse is that they may not seal well. If you are willing to run the small risk of a couple of failures go for a second use my mum always did if they looked okay.  anything that didnt seal we just stuck in the fridge and ate that week. It is really just a trade off between the cost of the rings dozen v the cost of a seal not holding.You can buy these bits online or usually at hardware stores.  You can sometimes get the rings at the supermarket.  You can just use a big stock pot. The new kits come with a thermostat but the old ones where just a big pot that you stuck a thermometer in to check temperature. The dimensions were wider and shallow than you would usually get in the same volume stockpot so you can fit more jars in at a time. I think there is an insert so the jars dont sit on the bottom of the pan but i cant remember.  Cheap old style second hand ones show up on ebaygumtree all the time if you get serious.The vacola gear isnt for pressure canning like is often discussed here but is the same method as water bath canning. So the lid doesnt need to seal tight just loose like a normal saucepan.If you dont already have a copy hunt down a vacola book.  You can buy a new one at   but as it hasnt really changed in the past several decades an old one would do fine. Check ebaygumtree etc. The only thing to watch for if you go pre s is it might not be metric but the general instructions temps etc would be the same.extra tipif searching for more info on Australian websites the terms used will be preserving or bottling rather then canning.  There are quite a few out there that will have recipes and instructions specifically to suit Vacola gear as this is by far the most widespread in Oz.Happy bottling.EDIT found this useful link that includes how to just use a stockpot rather than a proper vacola pan. ,Canning,cszppnd,1,t5_2re2w

5105598,0,t3_3kuwmq,I had the same question this spring. I emailed Ball canning co and they said it is a non issue the kids will work just fine. Here is more info from their website as some procedures regarding lids have changed in recent years.   There are three important things to know. First we recommend using only BallKerr brand lids. They are BPA free and offer the safest most reliable results of any lid on the market. The second most important thing you need to know is never use a lid twice. After the first use the lid will no longer seal effectively so a fresh lid must be used every time.And now for the third and perhaps best news Preheating lids is not required! After extensive testing by our Quality Assurance Team we determined that it is no longer necessary to prewarm lids before use. If you desire it is still safe to simmer your lids before use however you should never boil them. Our recommendation for over  years has always been to simmer F not boil F the lids.Why dont I have to preheat my lids?After extensive testing by our Quality Assurance Team we determined that it is no longer necessary to prewarm lids before use. If you desire it is still safe to simmer your lids before use however you should never boil them. Our recommendation for over  years has always been to simmer F not boil F the lids.When was this change made?Believe it or not in ! At that time we switched our sealing gasket from being latexbased to Plastisol. Latex required preheating to soften it prior to canning in order to create an effective seal. The Plastisol does not require preheating but doing so will not damage it.What about sterilizing the jars?Presterilizing jars and lids is not necessary in the home canning process. If you are following a recipe that processes in your canner for  minutes or more the sterilization will occur during that time.How should I prepare my lids now?Removing the simmering step was designed to make the home canning process easier than ever speeding up the time it takes to preserve your favorite fresh local produce. This is entirely unrelated to the BPAfree coating change in our lids. That change was made to the underside coating and did not impact the sealing compound. After extensive testing from our quality assurance team Jarden Home Brands current recommendation is to prep lids by washing with warm soapy water and keep at room temperature until ready for preserving.Why havent I heard about this before now?We understand there are some inconsistencies in our current recommendations and what is printed in previous editions of the Ball Blue Book. Jarden Home Brands has already announced these changes to the public via its website www.FreshPreserving.com live webcasts and canning demonstrations as well as through updated packaging changes and on social media. We understand that many of our consumers are experienced canners who no longer seek instructional updates but its always important to ensure that youre following not only the USDAs most uptodate recommendations but also those of the manufacture. We are trying to communicate the change with as many preservers as possible.Wont this lead to more seal failures?Any seal failures are likely unrelated to the updates in the Ball or Kerr canning lids as the sealing compound has remained essentially the same since . If you are experiencing seal failure please visit our Problem Solver page to explore possible solutions.While those are the three most important things to know they just scratch the surface! Heres everything you need to know about lids.Canning lida one or two piece lid that seals onto a jar for preserving fresh food.

Blend as in blender first with salt pepper and balsamic vinegar to taste.  Finish by blending in olive oil again to taste.

5839368,0,t1_cxfgrtt,As somebody who has just stumbled upon this subreddit and never performed canning I can say that this isnt really laziness. I would never have questioned buying this if I wanted a personalised jar. It really would never have occurred to me that I could make my own and I think this goes for most people who arent canners. Even if it did occur to me I dont have the required materials at my disposal  for a start I have no empty jarscans since my jam jars go straight in the bin after being used as there is no other use for them.So not laziness more like most people really wouldnt consider the fact they could make them at home whereas you guys might instinctively make them at home as using cans and jars is a regular part of your life.,Canning,cxl2gks,1,t5_2re2w

11701496,0,t3_66yn4m,For the most part fermented products assuming theyre correctly fermented are pretty shelf stable. They will last longer in the fridge but they arent going to suddenly become toxic because you dont put them in the fridge. The biggest reason for putting a fermented product in the fridge is to slow downhalt the maturation of the ferment and set the flavour at a certain point and to control how much acid is produced.If youre comfortable giving away your fermented products Im assuming youre comfortable with your fermentation game and that youre sure the product is safe already. If you were packaging for commercial sales you would definitely need to pasteurize and can the product or keep it refrigerated but for mailing to a family member you should be fine transferring the sauce into clean sanitized bottles and ensuring that the seal on those bottles is sufficient for transport. If the seals are good for transport leave the bottles for a few days to see if any further fermentation causes them to pressurizeleakexplode and you should be good to go to send them out. You might want to check on the procedures for mailing stuff like that though.,Canning,dgmdt41,6,t5_2re2w
