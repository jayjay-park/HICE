4325971,0,t1_csd8v7k,Thanks. I guess Ill have to pregenerate the ghost blocks after all. You see my problem is that ghost blocks sometimes dont really generate when theyre far away from the player so the elevator often fails because there are no slime blocks. Theres a ton of visual glitches too but those are of no harm.I think Ill soon have an almostfinished elevator world download using tripwire ready.,technicalminecraft,csd9kwe,1,t5_2wfxg
4854213,0,t3_3hdd5c,Chunk loading is not possible in spigot period. If you use a plugin to keep spawn chunks loaded the iron titan can work. Spigot has a lot of optimizations meaning villages work extremely different. multivillage farms dont work like they do in vanilla. I have spent several hours trying to get one of them to work on spigot but I couldnt do it. It is obviously possible to make one work but you need to know a lot about iron farms and you need to know what the settings of the server you are on are.See also this thread,technicalminecraft,cu6eri4,4,t5_2wfxg
6278181,0,t1_cz38w0m,Ok how should I spread it about multiple windowspcs? do i just put in lower and lower values for each pcwindow? Edit I think I figured it out I can do this by simple math and assigning the threads lower numbers.  Now how do I pause the program or see what values the program was on in the event of a pc crash? ,technicalminecraft,cz39bgg,1,t5_2wfxg
