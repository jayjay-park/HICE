369560,0,t3_1yb9jl,Hey hows it goin?Little about about me  student athlete straight male have had  sexual partners really just like having fun and am very open minded.I really hope this sub takes off and looking forward to helping with the progress! Feel free to ask questions.,LetsGetLaid,cfj2jk7,3,t5_30gja
375717,0,t3_1ydr91,Ive heard good things about Hula Its an app that lets you share verified STD test results with potential partners.Unfortunately theres no Androind version ,LetsGetLaid,cfjpifq,1,t5_30gja
376735,0,t1_cfjmdav,Gender flair sounds cool! Sexuality flags and a short text maybe? heres a lot of them on wikipedia near the bottom for a gallery of them,LetsGetLaid,cfjtb89,4,t5_30gja
377134,0,t1_cfjucm9,The idea of women increasing their attraction in the same way as men is an interesting idea Ive been thinking about. On the whole mens attraction is almost entirely based on looks while womens is looks plus personality. Remember attraction is the base emotion of finding someone sexually desirable. Obviously many men consider more than looks when considering a partner but this happens consciously while attraction is subconscious. So advice to women is basically just look better.However I think Ive found that a womans personality can effect attraction. Its still not as much as a man can but Ive found myself attracted to girls who were mediocre looking because of how they act. So confidence can help women too I bet.,LetsGetLaid,cfjuswb,-3,t5_30gja
378975,0,t3_1ydnuj,This sub needs to stick to CHANGING THE SCRIPT! My post I just made proposes the type of environmentworld Id like to live in within the context of a pick up scene. We have to observe those subreddits like rtheredpill and rseduction and REDEFINE OURS  in such a way that WE LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES. They have some great information in those subreddits in terms of selfconfidence and rewiring yourself  BUT!! They made major mistakes on fundamental levels like having to be superior or an asshole.. Or degrading others in your eyes.. Theyve made useless errors in their processes that dont need to be apart of the recipe. We can change the recipe the main ingredients they used in those subreddits serve as a reflection to show us what main ingredients SHOULD be in the recipe. Ive got a strong vision of what change is needed. I just hope this subreddit sees as clearly as I do right now.,LetsGetLaid,cfk1obu,1,t5_30gja
383549,0,t3_1yhdss,Hmmm Im not sure I think of it this way. Framing it like this makes it seem like you have to convince them somehow. Usually if Im getting a good vibe its as simple as saying something like you wanna get out of here?. Theyll either say yes or no depending on if they like you. Theres no secret password you just gotta be bold and take a shot!,LetsGetLaid,cfkiqar,15,t5_30gja
387582,0,t1_cfkxbqu,You dont have enough dignity participating in conversation with you is contributing nothing to anyone. You cant infer properly nor can you see clearly. I dont need a reason to be confident that is why they call it SELFconfidence. In any case I dont claim to be able to use language to a better caliber than anyone without knowing it for certain. Ive already seen you dont know when youve lost or won so what? You expect me to explain to you how your whole starting point is bullshit and you are already defeated? The point youre coming from is already one of loss. If you had any real interest and werent so butt hurt it might help me to tell you but sadly for you the conversation ends here. My interest in you from here on is purely to face an ugly reflection. ,LetsGetLaid,cfkxsp8,1,t5_30gja
396316,0,t3_1ykww9,There are different approaches. Even if Im looking for casual sex personality and compatibility are huge for me. All the great pictures in the world dont make up for a bland profile and boring messages.,LetsGetLaid,cfluegt,1,t5_30gja
415479,0,t3_1yu40h,If you know that a person really truly likes you and theyre only having sex with you because of those feelings and they wouldnt have casual sex and you lead them on and let them think that youre reciprocating feelings...that seems pretty crappy. Im fully in support of open and honest communication.But if you know that they desire you and you dont desire them for anything more than sex but youre both open about it then I see no problem. I think it would probably be a bad idea for the person who wants more than sex but thats another discussion.,LetsGetLaid,cfntw8f,5,t5_30gja
445382,0,t1_cfqtbu5,The trouble with saying you came on too strong is that its possible for him to misread that as you made a mistake but maybe you could rectify it... Once his chances are down to nothing its best to give him an unambiguous message ASAP IMHO.,LetsGetLaid,cfqxgd6,2,t5_30gja
465540,0,t1_cft5x33,Dont downplay or oversimplify sexual strategy for women. There are numerous things women need to take into account ways to find guys they would actually want to fuck and ways to behave in order to get laid.,LetsGetLaid,cft6m66,5,t5_30gja
465586,0,t3_1zcx2a,I might actually know you IRL or knew you.  I PMed your AMA account with a question that would confirm that.  If you do confirm I do have a thing I have to say to you.,LetsGetLaid,cft6sy8,1,t5_30gja
472865,0,t1_cftx21m,Why is that bad? If youre inexperienced you have to accept that sometimes youll be weeded out based on that inexperience. That is just how everything works when you are inexperienced. Inexperienced workers usually dont get as much bonuses as experienced workers. Inexperienced poker players usually dont win as much as experienced poker players. Inexperienced musicians usually dont get to play the larger gigs. Etc.Why demand that inexperienced daters get special treatment? if they truly dont hold those views theyll learn quickly enough to not sound like somebody who does.,LetsGetLaid,cfu0mul,5,t5_30gja
599213,0,t1_cg782zo,Ill preface this by saying that Im talking out of genuine curiosity and not trying to cast doubt or provoke you or anybody. The very fact that getting explicitly and inappropriately propositioned by a complete stranger groped rubbed deliberately sexually intimidated and the like is a common occurrence in your life and per you and some of the other women here pretty common for a lot of women is kind of mindblowing. So much so that I find it impossible Ive lived my whole life somehow missing it. I know a lot of women. My wifes never experienced this. None of her friends have. None of my friends have. None of my female coworkers have. None of my coworkers or friends girlfriends or wives have. Absolutely nobody in my social circle near or far has ever shared experiences like this. I mean maybe an occasional rude comment from a drunk guy but nothing like getting felt up and chased down by strangers. Maybe its because Im a sheltered upper middle class educated white guy from an upper middle class family whos always lived in the good parts of good towns gone to good schools and worked whitecollar jobs.I only hear about stories like this on TV and over the internet. Nobody I know and nobody who knows anybody I know has ever reported anything like this. How have I missed this my entire life? Is it just the circles I keep?,LetsGetLaid,cg8du2n,6,t5_30gja
612209,0,t1_cg9qgt1,gt I dont NEED to date anybody but I wouldnt sleep with somebody I wouldnt date.I would agree to that only my history would proof me a liar.Pretty much anyone can be sparkeling for a night but most fade rather fast.gt But if we go out and we hit it off and we hook up on the first date the interest in an actual relationship is usually off the table.Im into people who are like me in so far as they go for what they wantand if theres no fire theres no point to start a relationship in the first place.,LetsGetLaid,cg9uz4o,2,t5_30gja
997598,0,t1_chhnldu,I would have to say stay away from any sort of hey etc.The most generic opener ill respond to unless Im really attracted to the girl is a comment on my hair. A bland hello means absolutely nothing when Ive never met you before and were talking over the phone. Be fun be original. The more interesting the opener the more youll get out of the conversation  times. At least in my experience.Im male btw.,LetsGetLaid,chhon2q,2,t5_30gja
999365,0,t1_chhvdmd,Aw thats the one! I did delete it before because I was like WOW PHONE APP SCREW YOU. And then I was like Jesus why didnt I just edit it instead? and then I made a post.Look its Wednesday Im a little loopy.Thank you!,LetsGetLaid,chhvvyt,3,t5_30gja
1190739,0,t3_27qrza,What you are really asking is How do I break it to her that we could try it out without making things awkward between us and us stay friends if she says no.You are going to have to risk all of that if you really want it.  Just be straight with her.  Dont tip toe around the subject.  Just tell her how you really feel.  Take that leap.,LetsGetLaid,ci3ks1c,3,t5_30gja
1372535,0,t3_29s5eb,meet other girls after you fuck it up with this one. thats my advice. ,LetsGetLaid,cioc2pb,-1,t5_30gja
1450682,0,t1_cixmlzm,Well put! This creepy thing is getting out of hand. A lot of women deal with this it doesnt mean we dont want any guy to talk to us. It means we dont want creepy guys the minority to talk to us. ,LetsGetLaid,ciy49we,1,t5_30gja
1457917,0,t1_ciylt4h,I have hooked up with several women through Tinder. With none of them did I start the conversation with something witty. In fact out of all the women Ive met in person with all except one I started with hi. The reply rate is lower than if I use some sort of opener but the probability that theyll respond to the fifth message is a lot higher.,LetsGetLaid,ciz0wx2,2,t5_30gja
