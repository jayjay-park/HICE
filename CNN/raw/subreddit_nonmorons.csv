9871804,0,t1_dauag7o,gt Every stance Trump has taken aligns with a nationalist vision for the country while Clinton platformed on almost the exact opposite.What politicians say has the value of used toilet paper.  Only their record counts.  And the records of Trump and Clinton are very similar and reflect total corruption.gt Your argument seems to be that despite what Trump has said and despite the fact that he has shifted the Overton window to the right and despite that fact that he is surrounding himself with other political figures who have a track record that favors nationalism altrighters are being taken for fools by believing Trump.You mean like this guygt Even if Trump isnt seen as ideal by the altright you can surely see how his political gravity is helpful to the altright right?Trump will totally discredit the altright.  After  years of Trump America will turn sharply to the left.gt Im not sure why you dont think there are communities of altrighters.Because I havent heard of any.  Are there any?  Tell me about it.If you want to see what a nonmoronic version of the altright would look like look at Putins Russia or look at Zionism.  Both are successful forms of nationalism.  And they are nonmoronic because they are based on nonmoronic cultures namely Russian Orthodox Christianity and Judaism.  Modern Western culture is completely moronic completely hopeless.,nonmorons,daubikq,1,t5_3hljr
