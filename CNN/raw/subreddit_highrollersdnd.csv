6638825,0,t3_46hw2o,Summoning Trotts Nerd VoiceUhh technically your D on Eloras sheet is not accurate. It appears to be a D of some sort due to the square base and rolling it would not give you a clear number as there is no clear top to the dice THANK YOU. Seriously though cool character sheets. ,highrollersdnd,d060fo4,3,t5_3bygj

7017438,0,t3_4blmcj,This may be an out of left field suggestion but if your DM is creative maybe they could help you create something similar to the Halfling Outrider But change it to fit a Gnome. It fits pretty well since both races are small the Ranger class also gets an animal companion and mounted archery is fun. ,highrollersdnd,d1brwl9,1,t5_3bygj

7176186,0,t1_d1tv2de,I dont think it would be fully taken as the pixie class I reckon Mark would just customise the gnome or something saves some time compared to fully homebrewing and it helps balance.,highrollersdnd,d1tv7f0,1,t5_3bygj

7326493,0,t1_d27jqxu,He is the only experienced DnD player outside the DM. He kind of has to stear things some. That is also his characters personality. Cam makes the sessions interesting otherwise its Elora asking what they should do Trell not saying anything and Kim stomping on everyones interest until she gets what she wants. Which would likely kill them all anyway.,highrollersdnd,d2az08a,1,t5_3bygj

7673667,0,t1_d3eff82,Same for me. Granny Trell is the funniest persona ever and this episode was easily the greatest in that regard. I havent laughed like that in years!,highrollersdnd,d3eg8o2,3,t5_3bygj

8668024,0,t3_4ymwk3,Edit Could have taken more than  days. Mentioned on Session  stream the adventurers has taken about  days or more! in the Underdark.TLDR it has been  DAYS since the start of them waking up in the elven barrow in Session  to obtaining an artefact in Session .With the help of the YogsCast wiki Session  Spent  full day to clear elven barrow Session  Took  full days from arrival at Tallfield to leaving for the feywild Session  Journey to feywild takes  days Session  Spent  day to defend Autumn Spire and battle against Green Hunter and another  day to find Cenaria then rest in Feyden Session  Spent  days to solve Feydens problem and Dimitriv Session  Spent  day for Cam to get punished start leaving for TalisVal and the same night where Cam gets a dream with Avandra Session  Spent  days in TalisVal from arrival till the unfortunate end of Feast of Stone. Note after the Black Valley Brewery the adventurers took a long rest speak with Korak then sleep for the night. Im assuming this long rest  hrs also includes the noncombat talks they had with Korak. If the long rest counts as a night rest then they have spent  days. Session  Took  day to quell the undead invasion in Whispers Walk Session  Spent  days journeying through Temple of Tharizdun encountering the duergars at Gloom clearing the drow enclave and battle with Queen Charisa Session  Current Spent  day travelling along the underground rapid and facing multiple clashes in Temple of DahMir,highrollersdnd,d6p4g29,12,t5_3bygj
8710431,0,t3_4z8jn8,They seem to shit on trell a bit too much when he goes down he got hit for  dmg and in previous encounters always for shitloads of dmg aswell. I know its all in good fun though you brits,highrollersdnd,d6ufunb,2,t5_3bygj
8760337,0,t1_d70hrro,Not really sure what you mean.  I doubt this group would be interacting with Broken Sky since they operate in the Dawn Republic which I dont think Kims oneshots are in yet. Yes it would require creation of areas of the world for the stories to take place in but the one shots already need that.  The events in each new Haunted location could be mostly selfcontained I just dont want it to always be a magical curse or supernatural entity I would like to see it occasionally be some lunatic summoning undead to scare off people while he tries to solve a mystery leading to a treasure of some kind. Scooby Do Style villains are fairly simple to write and they only tend to matter in the moment so they are perfect for Kims spooky one shots.,highrollersdnd,d70pb48,3,t5_3bygj
8839668,0,t1_d7adw67,Character names are still there and will remain there. I may also see if we can have like Cam Trott Elora Katie etc.,highrollersdnd,d7aeif7,3,t5_3bygj
8893546,0,t3_51rhg0,There isnt any sheet music for it sadly. However if you give me some time I could probably give you the note  chord progressions for it,highrollersdnd,d7gvlob,3,t5_3bygj
9221768,0,t1_d8krkfg,Agreed! It was really emotional when Cam said goodbye to Dimitriv and saw Mirella. Also Jasminas back story too! I hope Kat stays on as a permanent member honestly. ,highrollersdnd,d8kxdpp,1,t5_3bygj
9740163,0,t1_dadoayu,Ah dang I think I missed that. I know cousins can look like each other too but I doubt Mark would have said that if he wasnt planning on them being brothers. Well that my theory up in smoke P,highrollersdnd,dadorrh,4,t5_3bygj

10276136,0,t1_dc8tbwf,I think he intended to say Guardian of Faith as when he done the damage it was a flat  from a saving throw instead of  D,highrollersdnd,dc8ut39,2,t5_3bygj
10281384,0,t1_dc8tbwf,If you read the description the spell is clearly Guardian of Faith from the enter aggro radius to the  damage cap. They just refer to it wrong.,highrollersdnd,dc9g93u,2,t5_3bygj
10317105,0,t3_5np8j7,You could have them include a personal statement type thing that gives you some details of their backstory e.g. I first became interested in magic after a wizard rescued my sister and I from a horde of rampaging orcs.,highrollersdnd,dcdi04f,1,t5_3bygj
