7038472,0,t3_4c01bg,A bunch of questions here.... What do you think about Litecoin?. I watched your video about a blockchain paying its devs. Dont you think that reduces decentralisation as one has to define developers opinionated a large portion of mined coins will go towards developers essentially making that coin a monopoly and it reduces the incentive to work as developers know they will be getting a steady wage.. What is your real name? I seen variations of Amanda B. Johnson and Julia.. Do you think that Ether is viable as a currency? Mainly because the Ethereum network was built as smart contracts network.Ive got other questions for another time... ,TheDailyDecrypt,d1e610g,2,t5_3bna5
