343052,0,t3_1y0s5h,I got the Ruff Wear Summit Trex for my basenji.  I initially bought a set of four but ended up returning them after I found out you could buy singles for the same price.  Her front feet measured out wider than her back feet which is fairly typical of Basenjis.  I definitely recommend following their fit instructions closely and consider buying different sizes for front and back paws.I will say she wasnt so keen on them when I first them on her.  She did the funny little high step walk for awhile but didnt try to take them off.  I wouldnt leave her unattended with them on though as Im pretty sure she would remove them.  As soon as she gets running she seems to forget them and moves normally.  I hike trail run and mountain bike with her and Im overall really glad for extra protection.On a side note she has really long ankles that sometimes cause her to hyperflex during running and the boots do double duty in giving her a little ankle support.,Basenji,cfgbrx2,1,t5_2t0n2

Also he loves to tear apart little stuffed animals and remove all the stuffing.  Sometimes the pet stores have cheap cent ones that we buy a few of.  I would avoid bones and rawhide entirely.  My basenji chews them to pieces and then swallows chunks of them which cause vomiting and constipation. We obviously stay far away from them after realizing.,Basenji,d4rlhif,1,t5_2t0n2
