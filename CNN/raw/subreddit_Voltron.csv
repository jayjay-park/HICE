4360551,0,t1_csh5uef,Depending on the story the lions may appear to have some kind of awareness.  The recent Voltron Force cartoon played with this a bit.  In all versions the origin of Voltron had a little bit of a mystical element.But for the most part you are correct. The pilots are the main story drivers.,Voltron,csh61s5,2,t5_2sl4q

7919185,0,t1_d44ne4b,Im genuinely sad about the theme song. And the Blazing Sword doesnt quite have the same Majesty as the original. Those are honestly my only two problems. But REALLY important thing they did better than the original ALL THE PILOTS ARE WEARING THE CORRECT COLORS FOR THE LIONS THEY PILOT!,Voltron,d466w6w,14,t5_2sl4q
7945727,0,t3_4o139h,It could be that Shiro was not hallucinating. Maybe whatever the Druids did to modify both Sendak and Shiro allows them to communicate telepathically.Personally I think it was Shiros PTSD. Even if they could telepathically communicate that would not explain why Shiro sees or thinks he sees Sendaks eyes open. That is better explained as a hallucination.I do wonder why Shiro had such a vivid attack at that moment. He is able to hold it together in other seemingly more stressful situations. I guess it is connected to him being the only one willingable to stand watch over Sendak as the Castle downloads his memories.,Voltron,d496a13,2,t5_2sl4q
7946638,0,t1_d46hhf2,What he really means is that he cant deal with the idea that there are people different than him in the world and he hates the idea that people want to see those differences represented in TV shows and movies.  And he really wishes theyd shut up about it so he calls them names and makes things up about them online.Basically anyone who uses the term SJW can be safely ignored because theyre giving themselves away as being ignorant.,Voltron,d499yy3,3,t5_2sl4q
8000777,0,t1_d4ettw7,They took more inspiration for the team from the original GoLion then toned down the theme for children. I dont see Shiro previously changed to the God awful Sven dying this time.,Voltron,d4fd3ay,3,t5_2sl4q

8331068,0,t1_d5iudw7,Oh theres a whole thing on tumblr about it.  It also deals with the purple splotches he got from the quintessence lightning and how he was able to operate a Galra control panel with his hand when everyone else needs a robot arm or Shiros hand to do that.

10769858,0,t1_dd08l2q,Yeah but they were already in the garrison or at least the program Lance etc were in. Lance was originally set as a cargo pilot but hed wanted to be a fighter pilot. Since Keiths absence meant that Lance was in the fighter classes that meant that he was just next in line for the fighter pilot program. ampnbspSince we see that hes nowhere near the pilot Keith is its a logical jump to guess that theyre not just going on pure skill. Theres an academic element as well and while Lance was maybe not the best in terms of the performance aspect this must mean he was able to get in based on other criteria. And given that Lance knows garrison tech and craft well enough to be able to quickly tell that Pidges computer wasnt garrison tech and that the craft Shiro crashed in on wasnt any of the garrisons I have to figure that Lance must know his stuff well enough to compensate for not being as good a pilot as some others would have been. ,Voltron,ddqtxlu,1,t5_2sl4q
