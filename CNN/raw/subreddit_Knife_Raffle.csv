Generally for slower filling raffles people will wait longer but for popular raffles where there are multiple people in line for spots theyll wait less. If your time difference is an issue and youre concerned about your spots I would simply pay when you call a spot and then you dont have to worry about missing the call for payments. ,Knife_Raffle,dbk0627,2,t5_37nl4

11547919,0,t1_dg4mbqu,Damn solid points. I definitely think in that case that more of those designers bridging the gap would have more of an effect on clones than the rise of more popular Asian made knives. As someone who has definitely fallen victim to that false pretense you mentioned is there a reason I would wanna pick a WE or Reate over a US made maker at the same price point? Ive seen quite a few Reates Ive liked but have always been hesitant to pull the trigger. If anything I guess my bias is thinking QC wont be as strict but I would love to learn more and change my mind on that if I know Im wrong.,Knife_Raffle,dg4yjk3,1,t5_37nl4

11581672,0,t1_dg8s86s,I dont know of anyone on here that has but in the month or so Ive been on IG I saw two people get shut down due to raffle being said.  Its just a easily avoidable thing that people tend to pass off as not a big deal until it happens to them.  I was wrong thou I assumed all knives were prohibited similar to almost anything relating to guns is.  I just like to ere on the side of caution when it comes to PayPal as Id like to keep my acct and always get worked when this happens hoping that it might stop the next guy from doing it. ,Knife_Raffle,dg8sfcu,1,t5_37nl4
