I was more assertive and less confused with boundaries and norms because it gave me a direct route. Now everything is open to me and its... overwhelming so much so that I feel quite despondent having to chose. I got into nihilism a little too late in my depression so despite the fact that I can do anything I want I dont feel like it. Nothing makes me happy so nothing seems worth the effort to expend. I mean its still nice being able to do what ever the fuck I want but its no fun when you literally dont want to do anything. And sentimentally I still feel attachedbound to my family so Id feel horrible just leaving them given all theyve done for me... so I still feel somewhat restrained.Pretty much I dont act on my nihilistic freedom because theres not much that interest me about life in general and I still feel like I have obligations to my family.,nihilism,cgq94a9,3,t5_2ql4x

1174033,0,t3_27jw89,Well I have some comments.Principle . Things exist for the sole purpose of its end. Are you saying that there is an objective purpose for things and that purpose is their ends? First there is no object purpose for things. Second how do you know that the objective purpose is for their end? Why not their beginning or middle or whole lifespan. The sentence needs to be revised. Just say there is no objective purpose for things.Principle . The statement says ultimately you will never change anything. People change external things all the time. This is just incorrect. Are you saying people will not change important things? Who says what is important? Just say instead that judgments about what constitutes important things are subjective.It may be true that there are no objective purposes though nihilists can accept that subjective values exist and drive people the nihilist just knows that that these subjective values are baseless or are based on other subjective values which are in turn baseless.  The liberation and responsibility that are mentioned in the paragraph refer to the existence of these subjective values. I guess I am suggesting that that status of subjective values should be explored explicitly in the statement of principles. Specifically say that subjective purposes exist subjective morality exists one can change subjectively important things things have subjective utility and value and the size and nature of the universe has subjective value. Without talk about subjectivity I think the principles seem incomplete they do not convey the whole picture. Also it is not clear why the lack of objective values brings peace. There are some typically delusional religious people who think that only objective values can bring peace. You may want to explain that peace is the result of realizing that all values are subjective therefore one can chart their own course in life by accepting or inventing their own value system without concern for an external objective value system.  Otherwise the rest of the principles are pretty good.,nihilism,ci1p66y,2,t5_2ql4x

This is primarily because of my claim that there is not a singular global future or even a larger societal narrative with any sort of consistency. In some places classical libertarian social systems will exist perhaps even in a developed enough capacity to last for quite some time. But as far as generalizing those means I have no faith.Further I question whether a classical libertarian economy that is not organizationalist in nature could exist. The economy I envision  again for whatever segments of society Id like to inhabitcreate  is libidinal in nature and rooted perhaps in natural abundance.

There are mostly two things that keep me not wanting to die yet.  My passion for gaming and escapism. I love fantasy love going inside different worlds where things work differently and the rules of reality do not apply. If there are two good things the real world ever provided me were the ability to mentally escape it even if for short periods of time and a framework of how shitty things are and can be so I can see fantasy and appreciate it. If I ever get physically mentally or financially unable to enjoy games I think I wouldnt mind offing myself.  My family. I love my parents theyve been always so supportive during my whole life. In many times I think or act like an ungrateful little shit and they still support me and love me and sometimes I feel really bad because I find it very hard to express my emotions and how grateful I am for everything they do to help me and provide for me. As long as they are alive Ill try to fight and keep going on with my life because I feel bad just thinking about how much grief and sadness theyd feel if their son committed suicide. But if the both of them ever pass away and I finally become truly alone I dont think Id hesitate.Aside from those I really dislike life. Its brutal its unjust and nothing and nobody really matter in the bigger scheme of things. We are raised being taught about good about good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and getting punished. Then we grow up and learn that justice is not always served and evil gets its way more often than not. People die for no reason aside from fuck them and from diseases they have no control over.

There is layer  that you give to the general public and people you dont know very well. Layer  is what coworkersfriendsacquaintances get to see. Layer  is what your best friends see which may also be the same as layer  which is completely private information and your true nature.We all act differently to different people its not really restricted to nihilists.

In the end the conclusion I came to only works in a perfect world where there is no false conviction. Even then vengence doesnt really do anything. You may have killed the murderer but this still doesnt have any effect on the lives that were lost. Lifetime sentences seem to be the best choice at first glance but it doesnt do anything but prevent further murders. Since morals are entierly subjective my shortest conclusion would be the following If you take another persons life you basically broke the main rule of humanity you are not human anymore. You lost your privilege by destroying someone elses. I mentioned organ harvest before but it seems really applicable after all this thinking. Its basically potentally saving some lives to compensate for taking others. This is still quite convoluted because it doesnt take into account things like animal lives instincts and a few other things but this seems like the most logical way at the moment at least in my mind.

5714849,0,t1_cx3dbda,My point is that uKajenx has run every meaningful universe scenario that he could imagine and found them all to be illogical. I accept your point that this does not necessitate that there is no logically meaningful universe. He did confess that he couldnt conceive of a meaningful universe and this is why he thinks its logically impossible. Based on my own interpretation of the way he presented his argument.You can use the same argument against moral nihilism. Just because humanity cant find a solid foundation by which to build its morals doesnt mean there are none. The central argument that leads me to nihilism is that meaning and objective morality are only evident inside the minds of men. The fact that these beliefs have such powerful attachments to our emotional regulation is strongly indicative of the ideas being an evolutionary tool for the brain capacities we have. A more base specimen will act solely on programming and impulse seemingly whereas we are more complicated and require more understanding of the world around us to continue existing as a species. Evidence of this again not concrete is found in the relationship between nihilism and depression and depression and suicidenot doing things to advance the species.gtFor example I do not need to prove that zero does not equal every other possible number. I only need to prove that zero equals zero.This is a great way to dodge the burden of proof situation. Typically the burden of proof lies upon those claiming something exists. Show me meaning and objective morality. This doesnt exist is not parallel to zero is all I can say in response to that.  In mathematical terms people who say there is meaning in the universe are saying that  or any number. We are simply saying no it doesnt. Not zero.,nihilism,cx5he3u,1,t5_2ql4x
5714880,0,t1_cx3dbda,Its somewhat simple to me.  Any object that might give the universe meaning would itself be meaningless.  Because of this there is no meaning possible in an objective sense.  Its kind of like how time and space can only be measured when you are relating things to each other.  How fast are we currently moving right now?  If you are comparing yourself to the earth theres no movement.  It you are comparing yourself to the sun its probably hundreds or thousands of mph.  If you are comparing yourself to the center of the galaxy it would be even faster.  So meaning only exists as a relationship between things its never an objective quality of the universe.Another example comes from atheism.  If there is a god who created the universe then who created god.  If god gives the universe meaning what gives god meaning?An analogy Ive used elsewhere on here  Say you have a road in the middle of nowhere that leads from nowhere to nowhere.  The road has a purpose to be driven on or walked on but its ultimately meaningless because no one can use it to get anywhere.EDIT uFistOfNietzsche  I guess my reasoning did have something basic to refer back to haha.,nihilism,cx5hj35,4,t5_2ql4x

Not really good or bad... Could be good could be bad depends on how it changes my behaviour. But never anxiety for me...I remember as a kid i used to get this inexplicable indescribable feeling when i truely considered the notion of being dead. It was kind of like a feeling of awe or intense headtrip type feeling... But it was a very rare feeling and i couldnt make it come on every time i considered death... It was just a certain few times when i really considered the notion of what must it feel like to be dead to experience nothing whatsoever? and for some reason as a kid it would elicit this strange powerful feeling. But i havent tried to ellicit this emotion since i was a kid... I dont think it would work anymore... But anyway even this strange feeling wasnt anxious...

However other knowledge does exist. The human approximation of knowledge which I believe is the true definition of knowledge has much lower requirements for existence. I know that due to gravity a ball I through upwards will return to earth. I dont know for sure since I havent thrown a ball an infinite amount of times. Regardless I cannot reasonably answer I dont know when someone asks me if the ball will come back down. There are things we can know even if the underlying theory is proven wrong. If we at some point actually discover how gravity works and it upends years of accepted theories I know that ball will still drop.

I dont believe this follows. If suffering is meaningless then we can be ambivalent as to whether one suffers. If life is meaningless then we can be ambivalent about whether one dies. An absolutely nihilistic view would have it that it simply does not matter that you nearly starved to death and there is nothing preferable about your having survived than your having died. Things are different because you lived  but not better at least not in any objective sense.A statement that nihilists should have a meaningful goal to better people carries with it a lot of assumptions about value and objectivity which nihilism rejects.,nihilism,czjipa0,1,t5_2ql4x

I could not see myself being satisfied with a life that consisted of working to eat and eating to work for  years at some unfulfilling nonsense even though I told myself someone who believed in nothing should be satisfied with this kind of nothing life.I panicked about the living death of a what I imaged mainstream life was like and became drug addict and a criminal instead of some kind of professional which led to a lot of suffering of a different kind needless to say. I thought if I am basically a meat robot driven exclusively by biology and social conditioning and nothing more fuck it anything bad goes. This was childish and misinformed but understandable considering how Id been conditioned.Now that Im old I sometimes yell at those who remind me of younger me on reddit as if Im now some kind of expert on what not to do.

7937660,0,t3_4ntr6i,The mistake youve made here is simple.  I made it myself as well so I dont judge.  Meaninglessness is neutral.  If it makes you feel bad you are actually imposing your own judgements on it.  You are deciding to feel bad about it.Consider this carefully its the key as a nihilist you get to choose how you feel.  There are no moral ideals to guide you and there are no rules or goals you have to follow.  The mistake is thinking this means that nothing should feel good and choosing to demean or devalue things you used to enjoy.  Nihilism is not a requirement to treat everything equally.  Ita simply the acknowledgement that your opinions and feelings are based on nothing.So heres the thing you can feel good doing all of those things you mention you can feel good about your kids and your wife you can enjoy vacations if you want to.  You have to choose to do so though.  Youre in a trap thinking you must be neutral.  If youd like to feel good the simplest answer is to examine your current life as it is right now and affirm that it is good. Emotions are binary  they are meant to steer you towards or away from things.  If you dont want to be gloomy then stop being gloomy.  This is called bootstapping  pulling yourself up by the bootstraps.  Its actually very simple but it can be hard to do.  You just need to realuze that your feelings are nit the truth and you get to direct them if you so choose.When you start to see everything as good then life will be good.  Pointlessness is good.  Death is good.  Working is good.  Adversity is good. Rest is good.  Whatever is happening let it be good and you will be content.EDIT I am going to predict a counter argument here.  Someone might respond with well thats just lying to yourself.  But consider this how is feeling bad about things not lying to yourself?  Feeling bad is just as innacurate as feeling good.  Feelng good however feels better.  You might say that your biology wants you to feel good and so its connected feeling good to your understandng of survival.  Since this is a binary system and you really cant feel neutral it is better to feel good and avoid being pushed and pulled by compulsion.  Instead of trying to push the whole world away from you you decide to welcome all of it.  This is much more restful since you can never push the whole world away.Also consider what you really want.  Dont tell yourself you dont want anything bexause that isnt true.  We all want to find peace of mind.  Tranquility comes when there is nothing we feel in conflict with.  As a nihilist you can decide to reject your minds survivalism and hack it to integrate into the world cmpletely  removing all conflict and findng a final peaceful resting place to call home.  Watch yourself for negative reactions and flip them  its really that simple.  Just decide everything is okay.  Its okay that I have a headache.  Its good that Im working right now.  its good that I have a wife.  its good that Im single.I mean all of our opinions are programmed into us.  Reporgram yourself.EDIT  You can even work with goals and a value system using this.  If you want to be an activist you can just say Its good that I am helping people. And then when you have trouble and the people you are helping die or your cause is set back you just say Its okay that there is no meaning behind what Im doing.  Maybe you want to be a great painter you might say Paintng is good and the paintings I like are good.  Then when no ne buys your paintings and you get rude comments from critics you can say Its good to be challenged.  The point being that nothing is really bad or good  feelungs are just the way the brain steers.  As a nihilist you get to reject the cultural steering wheel and decide how to steer yourself.  You do have to steer though or youll just blow around with the wind aimlessly which is mostly unsatisfying.  Satifsfaction comes from being involved in good things.  When we talk about purpose and meaning were really just talking about how good we feel.,nihilism,d489nqc,2,t5_2ql4x

8295289,0,t3_4t1e3w,Lives do matter to me. Because I think they do and that is all there is to it. And I am sure you think so too no matter how much you want to deny it.Because to achieve any goals a person sets for themselves they need to be alive in the first place to do it. Death takes away almost any goals a person might have thus death is a bad thing and life is a good thing. And goals people set for themselves do matter. Meaning is an emotion so if something is meaningful according to someone then to them it IS meaningful by definition. Might not be meaningful to you sure but other peoples emotions dont have to be the same as yours.I think we should give this falalcy a name already. How about the Nihilistic Fallacy as Ive seen so many nihilists trip on it including myself? The idea that meaning has to be objective and the same for everyone for it to exist in the first place is simply wrong. Its like trying to prove that love doesnt exist because people dont love the same things.Nietzsche was right. This kind of nihilism is a phase and a delusion.

Both sides are similar attacking eachother because theyre merely wrong attaching values to subjective things and questioning the values of the opposite group.

8568548,0,t1_d6ceh2b,Sadly its pretty close. You see most of our actions arent truly based on what we define as ideal. Our own opinions about how we should act are based on what we struggle to be or what we find morally acceptable not what we are. This brings us to a second problemBeing hypocritical is often seen as immoral. However a person who follows radical viewpoints which involve discrimination and hatred and acts accordingly will use that as a shield against more correct ideals calling anyone who tries to follow these ideals an hypocrite because most people wont follow these ideals perfectly. Basically People tend to value more shallow yet consistent ideals instead of deeper but yet to be fully developed ideals. And thats a problem in the western society which follows a binary logical method based on right or wrong true or false Check out the link posted by FistOfNietzsche really good stuff about that.To simplify I believe that consistency should be limited to interpretating things because our mind requires at least a bit of logic. However our improvement only happens because we are inconsistent or else how would our philosophies improve? You think a philospher ever stops? We only start interpretating their thoughts when they die and cant make it better. Calling someone hypocritical is a foolish way of showing your ideals are not only incomplete we are always incomplete because we cant stop thnking but you also show pride and believe your thoughts are fully developed and good enough. Consistency is not supposed to be a function but a relation. Do not judge a theory based on its consistency judge the consistency based on the theory because it often does not need it...

8748213,0,t1_d6z624x,Im not talking about other peoples experience when I say to look at the evidence.  Im saying to look at your own experience.  Are there times when you cease to exist?  This is a universal yes  everyone has experienced going to sleep and waking up later.  Consciousness comes and goes so when I die Im assuming it goes.The most convincing experience Ive had was falling asleep after a two day train ride where I didnt sleep at all.  I got home at  in the afternoon and laid down.  I shut my eyes and opened them.  I thought i might have dozed for a moment then looked at the clock.  It was  the next morning.  I had ceased to exist for  hours.To be completely honest Im not sure why anyone believes death is anything else when this experience is so common.EDIT gt I think it is as objectively valid of a claim as the people who come back saying there was nothing and time was simply lost.Actually if you think about it the fact that anyone would say they just lost time is more valid and more compelling.  If everyone had some kind of experience it would indicate a continuous conscious experience was most likely.  But the fact that many probably most people report anesthesia or reducednull brain activity as lost time seems to indicate that its possible for conscious activity to stop completely.  This is more compelling because a hallucination or NDE could happen at any point when a brain is turning off or coming back online eveyone who reports what happens is in fact conscious to do so and thus had to become conscious again after being braindead.  Lost time is proof that consciousness can indeed be turned off which would mean its not a fixed and permanent aspect of reality.,nihilism,d6z6jhw,2,t5_2ql4x

8830965,0,t3_513w68,Try to explain exactly what youre afraid of.  There is nothing to be afraid of because death is nothing.  The fear you feel is because youre imagining some specific thing blackness?  Giant empty space?  Pain? Fear?.  None of the things you imagine are death.  Death is just nothing.Are you afraid of going to sleep?  If I were to say In an hour you will go unconscious for a day or so would be be afraid and terrified or would you just climb into bed and send a few texts that youll be unavailable for a while.Youre giving a lot of value to being aware and conscious but the truth is when youre dead there simply wont be anything of you left to feel regret or to miss existence.  Death is actually completely irrelevant to us.  Its not even an ending.  We wont really see it coming and then when were dead we wont be like oh I guess its over then.Imagine youre walking aross a road and get hit by a bus.  One moment youre walking across the road and before you even have time to register what is happening youre dead.  You will never even realize that day was the last one for you.  Youll just stop midthought midstride midday midlife.  If this seems scary consider that you had no idea it was coming so you were just having a normal day.  The act of dying is painless in this scenario as your brain is incapable of forming pain signals before its destroyed.  You are there one moment and then poof  its like youre in a deep sleep.  You just never wake up.  Theres nothing if you left.Think about the awareness youre experiencing right now.  This seems like a permanent feature of existence but it actually comes and goes and changes very regularly.  You sleep you daydream you zone out you focus in.  Experience itself is constantly changing.  When you die there are no states.  Its just gone the same way its gone when you have anesthesia or you enter the deepest sleep cycle.Ill leave you with a thought experement I like to use.  If I told you right now that youre immortal and will never die would you have any way to prove me wrong?  No because as long as youre here you will be alive and when youre dead there will be nothing there to prove me wrong.  Each time you seem to be dead but then come back to life you might say Aha I was dead just then!  Did you see?  and I would reply but youre here right now so obviously you didnt die.  Even after you are completely dead and your body rots away I could never really be sure you werent still immortal since you couod always pop up again and say look Im really dead now!  Do yu believe me yet?  And I could only respond well no because here you are again.  EDIT The point of this isnt to prove you could be immortal but the demostrate how lack of existence is simply empty of experience and not even an ending.So consider that your existence as it is night now is not steady or permanent you cant imagine nonexistence because it isnt an experience anything you image will be false and in the end you cant even prove you will actually die because you will never be here to know you died.  You are only here during your own existence.,nihilism,d79cwzk,2,t5_2ql4x

Hell you might start off with something such as morality or existence wondering whether there is any inherent meaning or purpose to the two and from there its a slippery slope. Eventually you begin to see all conceptstheories as frameworks that we construct in attempt to give reality this meaning and purpose and once you realise that that there is no absolutely correct or wrong way to interpret reality that is where you can truly begin thinking for yourself instead of being a mere slave to the ideas of others.,nihilism,d812bik,16,t5_2ql4x

9345155,0,t1_d8vhxgq,First of all my apologies for taking a while to respond but onto the point at hand.I did a poor job of explaining how I defined Meaning and Value so Ill attempt to clear that up hear.In my ramblings I defined a Meaning as the literal interpretation that something is. Water is water a glass is a glass and cats are cats. On the other hand I meant to define a Value as something we grant to something making it deeper than surface level. Now problem with using Water and a Glass as examples is that as a society weve already all agreed on Meanings and Values this things are inherit to us they dont warrant any deeper thought. However if you take something much less common and much more personal Im going to use something that relates to myself here such as writing then my definitions come more into play. The Meaning of writing is surface level. It is communication words on a page However you could say that the words have a whole other set of meanings and values but Ill try not to split hairs a tool basically. However at the same time it has a value unique to me. I love to write to tell stories its what I do. It is a part of who I am and in that way Writing is valuable to me. It has a unique value to me.,nihilism,d90kd4a,1,t5_2ql4x

9760204,1,t3_5eyh78,What is the meaning of life? is perhaps a question wrongly asked.The meaning of life is any dynamic process which  metabolizes energy  senses its surroundings  adapts or responds to changes and  reproduces with fidelity.Reproduction is used somewhat loosely in this definition and can include reproduction on the cellular level and even asexual reproduction.That is the meaning of life.Is that satisfying? Does that define the meaning of life adequately for you? Or were you trying to ask a different question?Humans have this interesting ability to look for meaning where there is none due to an evolution of abstract symbolic thinking. While symbolic thinking allows us to use technology from technos Greek for art or abstract expressions  it also allows us to be delusional and absurd. Logic and reason are wonderful tools but are incomplete e.g. CantorGdels incompleteness theorems of mathematics Sir Francis Bacons Idol of the Marketplace i.e. reality is not made out of words even Cartesian Dualism setting the mind apart from reality. Your logic and reasoning could be unassailable and you can still be wrong absurdism in a sense. Attributing meaning to life may be reasonable yet it may still be wrong or delusional.Many all? people need their delusions to prevent themselves from enacting suicidal behaviors. The noble lie is an attempt to give peoples lives abstract meaning in some sense.The processing power of the human brain is geared toward recursion and nested loops in an astonishing way. Language  symbolic thinking related to the evolution of FOXP genes is something humans are good at learning. Its like how a GPU is better geared toward matrix calculations for visual output than a CPU.Its very human to seek meaning just as science and religion are very human. It just isnt a feature of physical reality sift every atom every bit of matter and every bit of energy in the universe... and show me where meaning exists. Meaning is not woven into the fabric of existence  it is an emergent property of neurons in a particular arrangement perhaps but nothing more fundamental.However thinking that a particular arrangement of neurons is more than it is  has an evolutionary advantage. People who think they matter more tend to take proactive steps toward survival. Delusional people with high self esteems can enjoy a measure of success derived from their beliefs. Someone who knows the meaning of their life can be quite selfsatisfied regardless of the validity of their beliefs.Nobility and the priestly classes are gnostic of the meaning of life. They know supposedly. And they tend to know better than thou.Which is enticing. Doesnt everyone want to know the meaning of life? And have an answer for everything?One could author a new meaning icons symbols art techniques and technologies a new knowledgenobility and become an authority figure who disseminates meaning. Nietzsche advocated the transvaluation of values. And perhaps you could become a meaningmaker.Ex nihilo.Those are just some of my thoughts on the matter.I recommend a more precise question.,nihilism,dag5vwx,1,t5_2ql4x

10134566,0,t3_5l24x6,. Life has a meaning but its always a particular meanig for the particular life.  . Life also has a universal meaning which is decided democratically or ideologically by or for all of us.  . There might as well be a devine purpose for our existence but its a purpose for the divinity itself not for us. We are concerned with our own purpose which is very narrow and limited.  . There are forces of physics as well as indeterministic events of information. Forces are all around us. The problem is we are not able and never will be able to control them more then they control us.  .  Actually we know very well what happens when you die. You cease to exist as a process that you are. The circuit is broken and all the data gets lost dissolved by natural decay.  .  Nobody searches for universal meaning. You are indoctrinated to include it in your thought process in order to be controlled.  .  We are the most complex process known in the universe. Those who want to see as as slave robot animals however try to tell us we are next to nothing.  .  You are not nothing. You are in top of  of most complex things in this universe  unique never before occurred never again to occur in entire history of universe.  And nevertheless you will be terminated by this universe.  .  We are broken and we are incomplete this is what process means a continuous imbalance.  .  Rules are important to mediate our relations and keep the automatic stupidity of nature at bay. You would not be even capable of developing this petty rambling of yours if the society around you the internet developers the teachers of the language you use were not obeying simple practical rules.  .  Belief is an important element of intellectual work. It is the initial condition of experiment. We believe something to be something and then we proceed to test it.  .  we do what we do because of who we are   but who decides who we are? Above the obvious what we are the question of who we are is more complex then you imagine. Selfidentity is biggest unknown for every conscious human.  We precisely do what we do because we dont know who we are and who we are has nothing to do with what we are.  .  We help others because it is an intelligent thing to do.  .  A void is not simply a void. It is a call to explore reality. Simple it may seem to simpletons.    The end of freedom is when you believe you achieved it.   Freedom is not a state of being.

But as they grow older they work themselves even deeper into the fur. And there they stay. They become so comfortable they never risk crawling back up the fragile hairs again. Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. Some of the fall off but other cling on desperately and yell at the people nestling deep in the snug softness stuffing themselves with delicious food and drink.Ladies and gentlemen they yell we are floating in space! but none of the people down there care.What a bunch of troublemakers! they say. And they keep on chatting Would you pass the butter please? How much have our stocks risen today? What is the price of tomatoes?

10912266,0,t3_5vwy7h,Its not a philosophy of how to live your life though I think it informs the way we should think about how to be human very well. It is simply an acknowledgement that life is truly futile and pointless. The existentialists were very much concerned with how man should operate given these circumstances but existential nihilism is the basis for some of Sartre de Beauvoir and Camus work. Camus whole absurd hero stuff is in a very condensed sense man living on despite the absurdity of life. Part of that being that it has no intrinsic meaning ,nihilism,de5itxs,1,t5_2ql4x

11028306,0,t3_5xgkqr,Thats right the transforming now is all that exists.  The past and the future are products of thought and are only real insofar as the brain matter is real however the content of the thoughts i.e. the past and the future is not real.  This is what Jiddu Krishnamurti and David Bohm discussed deeply in The Ending of Time  Belief in the future i.e. an idealized mental construct is what has sustained hope and belief in progress and ultimately locked society into the secularized religious dualist mode of existence that has complementedfacilitated the spread of Western civilization.  Recognizing that the past is just thought i.e. memories and that the future is just thought e.g. memories of the past being modified in the present and projected beyond the present might destroy anything sacred humanity has built around either abstraction eg religion politics futurism primitivism etc..  Recognizing that all that exists is the here and now might lead to a radical negation of all psychological conditioning because that conditioning is sourced through agents with belief in reified pastfuture.gtNegation is the most positive action not positive assertion...To negate everything that man has invented to negate all his values ethics and gods is to be in a state of mind in which there is no duality therefore no resistance or conflict between opposites...To deny all this is to deny oneself and oneself is the conditioned entity who continually pursues a conditioned good...To the man who has negated all the assertions of society religion culture and morality the man who is still in the prison of social conformity is a man of sorrow. Negation is the state of enlightenment which functions in all the activities of a man who is free of the past. It is the past with its tradition and its authority that has to be negated. Negation is freedom and it is the free man who lives loves and knows what it means to die. Jiddu Krishnamurti Freedom Love and Action Eight Conversations,nihilism,dei17qb,4,t5_2ql4x

They are a part of his biological will to power and are an extension of himself. They are more flexibile and more strong. They are selfaware the bermensch recognizes and accepts the ultimate inaccuracy of human valuation. We cant get rid of values so this method is as good as they can get.
