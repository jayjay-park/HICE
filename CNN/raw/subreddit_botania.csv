4952083,0,t1_cuhnfvf,One lens trick I learned recently is that using lensweight will cause the block to fall just like gravel  but it also means that it if it falls on an entity torch whatever they turn into a block.

5379789,0,t1_cvz8dth,Droppers dont make sound when ejecting to an inventory. And it would have made the build more compact and cheap.If you want to save your ears though the best way is to turn off block sounds in options.,botania,cvzbu62,0,t5_36n08

5777046,0,t1_cxd6ja4,its a nice touch that they are called primus loci it really is a prime location since its the location that is special not just the flower Pit may have changed in a recent update but getting a flower through creative allows you to place your own primus locus flower I tested when sciencing to see exactly how much better than dayblooms they were and if it was worth going exploring to find a patch which is nice for mapmakers or HQM rewards I guess,botania,cxd73pp,1,t5_36n08
5778439,0,t1_cxdd3re,Yea... didnt explain the change very well.  Vazkii changed the policy on github to not allowing requests in the issues thread and I wanted to point it out.

6042334,0,t3_3y8qz5,What exactly are they doing with that much mana storage? Are they actually using that much mana? Mass producing dozens of terrasteel ingots at once? Or is it just in case and most of the time the mana is simply sitting there unused which is what I suspect is the case?Even using mana mirrors and digging around like crazy with a terra shatterer you are unlikely to ever need more than a dozen or so pools and if youre actually eat through that I recommend making more robust mana production. Every time Ive seen mass mana storage the mana does not get used.,botania,cybnr0u,12,t5_36n08
