3697191,0,t3_32q7nq,If youre from the coast the altitude might hit you at first. Craigslist is perfectly fine for looking for places to rent or just driving around neighborhoods you like. Around Hopewell there are projects and it can be a little hairy but Ive had friends that lived there with no problems. Fair south Agua Fria is its own communitycan be rough so if you arent from there probably dont move there. Otherwise most neighborhoods are fine houses in nicer neighborhoods get broken into and the police are useless so get an alarm system and insurance. Kokopelli Property has a reputation for spying on its renters.The bus system is okay not great. If you have to switch buses to get somewhere it will take forever. Probably best to buy a car.Healthy grocery stores all over La Montanita CoOp Kaunes super expensive meats Whole Foods Trader Joes Sprouts etc. Dr. Fields Goods just opened a new butcher shop.Hiking is everywhere. Frank Ortiz Dog Park is huge and gorgeousplenty of hills and arroyos for hiking. Atalaya Trail near St. Johns College is in the mountains. Hyde Parkgreat. Luckily this town is super dogfriendly so tons of great resource for your dogs.The town is compact and folks do bike all over but get a helmet because the drivers here are ridiculous. The roads are poorly maintained and goatheads will puncture any tire. Definitely better for mountain bikes than road bikes.,SantaFe,cqdpdf5,5,t5_2raxq

11793026,0,t3_688qsu,Youre going to get a lot of Meow Wolf! and probably some people who are goldurned sickntired of hearing about Meow Wolf. But its unlike anything else Ive ever seen and you should go. Other stuff I like there Kakawa Chocolate for chocolate the way they did it before Columbus. The Staab House bar at the La Posada is my favorite classy place to drink and the Matador is a great little dive bar. Evangeloss Cocktail Lounge if youre into live music. Realizing as I type I dont know much about the brewery scene there will leave that to somebody else. Amazing town for grub though Geronimo if youre feeling spendy have the elk. Jambo stands out as something different in a sea of New Mexican that lamb stew gawd. Too many others to list amazing amount of good food for the size.,SantaFe,dgws2bd,6,t5_2raxq
