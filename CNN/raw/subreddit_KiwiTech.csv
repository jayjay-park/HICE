279015,0,t3_1x9v7z,Hi thereIts very hard to find work from abroad particularly in this industry and especially if you dont have much experience.  Not saying its impossible but tricky.  Also a number of the big players have left NZ in the last few years which means fewer jobs and spare engineers kicking around.  One excellent employer you could try is Tait radio communications they are big enough to need people and do some world class work.But Id suggest you come over on holiday first.  Have a look around and see if you actually want to live and work here. We are a long way from everywhere so its a big commitment to come here.  Do some research and tour the country and maybe arrange to visit some of the companies you may want to work for.  If you fall in love with the place then you could do what I did and come over as a skilled migrant.  That way you can come here and work anywhere that you can find a job rather than being tied to one employer.But NZ is absolutely awesome there is a world of opportunities of you work hard and  its the beys country in the world to live!,KiwiTech,cf9okuw,3,t5_2thdd

4948412,0,t1_cui9sqk,Where did i say we copied memobottle? When we had the idea and then checked the market then we found memobottle. Which only further proved to us there was a market. Our bottle isnt even the same size shape or plastic as memobottle so how are we copying them? Also have you ever heard of alcohol flasks? So are you saying memobottle copied them?You also keep going on about how expensive we are...we arent on the market yet? so how do you no what our price is? Memobottle you had to pledge  to receive a REWARD bottle these are not purchases. Kickstarter is not a sales site. We currently are offering reward bottles for . Once they run out and in order for us to get funded not wasting money on producing reward bottles the are  which is higher than memobottle and lower than others on kickstarter. Again these are REWARD bottles these are not sales.If you paid any attention before running your mouth you would realise our bottle is a d printed prototype we even mention this which proves you did no research before spouting your shit. Memobottle used actual bottles for their campaign. We could not afford that or we wouldnt need kickstarter in the first place. Our final product will be as transparent and slightly more rounded in order to be blow molded making the final product look better....which once again we even mention.And choose to believe or not I dont really care the guy youre arguing with has nothing to do with the project nor do i know him or her. He just realises your an idiot. So what product have you designed? What job do you do? What do you actually contribute to society that gives you the right to talk shit on anyone elses ideas? Im going to assume its a big fat nothing. ,KiwiTech,cuiad63,1,t5_2thdd

Quite exceptional with debugging and analysis skills definitely the fastest way to troubleshoot IOS CLI. Pick up the Udemy coupon code to get Bryants course for . ,KiwiTech,cuigj50,1,t5_2thdd
