22530,0,t3_1ub371,Hey Im not going to give my impression or anything but in regards to the whole selfharming thing I might be able to give you someone to talk to. Im a guy who is only a year older than you and has had a friend also a girl who used to cut. Ive had troubles with depression myself but never taken it that far. So I kinda know what youre going through. This may not be an appropriate comment for this subreddit but I like to help people with issues like these whenever I can. ,whatsmyimpression,cegzycq,1,t5_2ygxd
135675,0,t3_1vmfss,My impression will not come across as nice.  Im sorry but this is my honest takeaway and remember a random internet strangers opinion of you is not a reflection of your quality of character.You seem fixated on counter opinion.  Either you do it for attention or out of a rebellious nature.  Race sex and loneliness are stuff you talk about frequently.  You have a propensity for pointing out flaws in other peoples opinions or perspectives but offer yours infrequently.  I get the sense that you intentionally hold back your true opinions a lot of the time by using a mask of irrelevancy randomness and sarcasm.  You almost go out of your way to disagree or put people down either out of a genuine dislike of people or an attempt at shock value.  Id wager you spent a considerable amount of time online in your teenage years participating in image boards and user groups.  Im pretty sure youre still a teenager for that matter.  Which reinforces the sarcastic rebellious mentality of your posts.    You pity your lot in life to be sure.  You probably think the cards are stacked against you and life is an uphill struggle.  Overly critical or aggressive father?  I think you suppress empathy and true emotion at least online and that may be related to pain in your life.  I kept looking for posts in which you showed your true feelings towards a subject opened up a bit but you keep yourself pretty guarded online.  There is however a lot of selfdeprecation in your posts.    Youre taking Spanish but dont exercise it.  Most likely cause it was required by your school or you thought itd be an easy credit.  Are you from Alabama?  You do seem supportive of artistic endeavors music art and are most likely part of the counterculture at your school.  You yourself like to engage in artistic activities and appreciate that spirit in others.      The world exists in your head.  Youre introspective and imaginative.  You were probably born late August.  August nd?  You love comics and probably want to be a comic book artist.  I could go on but its probably getting weird at this point.  If you feel the need for vindication I too have a Whats my Impression post.  Feel free to vent atabout me.Edit formatting n stuff,whatsmyimpression,cetvt4g,3,t5_2ygxd

772694,0,t3_2303p9,I gotta do this in  minutes wish me luck!You read the rules niiice. Answer questions that dont involve you directly seem to gain personal satisfaction by the act of helping. No need to be rewarded back.Based on submitted links you appear to be interested in learning how mainstream or common actions have dangerous or harmful sideffects. Perhaps in an attempt to find the flaws in widely accepted practices? The crack in the diamond nothing is perfect sort of rationale.This account has only existed for  days and youre already asking for an impression? Whats going on in your personal life?Despite finding flaws it is not ever your intention to discredit or damage other peoples feelings. Instead your actions suggest this is all meant to inform. Learn and live?Ah. I see so I am looking at a sleeper account used for a time and then dropped for a new.I wont dig into your old account since thats not the one you posted with.My impression if you will is of an individual whos worried they have lost their perspective.  During the windmill maybe youve made some quick decisions that you worry were not the right ones. You appear to cope by going online and advising others sharing your opinions and explaining how its all just a conversation not a debate. Your grammar changed with this account and the old though it has accellerated in recent days. Apparently some important life events have occurred otherwise you wouldnt talk differently. Youre big into ensuring that you are not forgotten that your mark is made on the internet and the earth the reason behind why you are passionately rational in all of your interpersonal actions. Seem to be unusually aware of your own mortality and how one day you might just drop off the radar. Suicidal and the first couple comments of that old account confirm. I cannot tell you how you grew up but I believe you have cut yourself off from some caustic people recently. Now youre adjusting to the personal freedom but are also resisting the urge to end yourself finding reasons to do so by making others happy.I cannot really give you advice and I doubt you want it. Good luck with your life and decisions you seem like a dude who is extremely empathetic and understanding of the hardships many face every day. Good friends good person I regret that your life hasnt been nearly so kind to you. In a perfect world everyone is happy but it failed me and it has failed you maybe in time youll learn to control the situation. Ciao luck.,whatsmyimpression,cgs3ypl,2,t5_2ygxd

I think the best way to do that is to find an organization on campus and start volunteering. Its a good way to meet new people and its good fodder for a resume.,whatsmyimpression,clnici3,1,t5_2ygxd

2246718,0,t3_2ktwfs,College student in Santa Cruz Engineer. Looking at some fitness stuff based on your questions going to guess youre probably similar to my body type lean but strong. Based on some of the random facts of knowledge youve accumulated and applied using sourgrass as a deodorant Id say youd be a pretty solid engineer. You enjoy appearing smart and well informed. Id also a venture a guess that you are pretty selfmotivated and are willing to teach yourself or push yourself to do stuff. ,whatsmyimpression,clpest3,2,t5_2ygxd
