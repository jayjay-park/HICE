8599557,0,t1_d6fjg0g,The roadblock of reading Wii discs with anything other than a Wii was that the track the disc is spun opposite of DVD and Bluray. The Wii disc drive would spin the discs in the opposite direction from CD drives and could read them fine but every CD reader would fail on that.How rips can still be manufactured are by buying a physical mod for the Wii which you connect inside of the Wii and then you can interface disc content to and from a usb drive. This way itll use the Wiis disc drive but dump the disc content on a hard drive.PlayStation spins the way CDs do and thats why the PS could play music CDs with that funky interface to control it.I guess therell have to be a physical mod for the Wii U for the discs to be ripped.,cemu,d6gjcxg,2,t5_3abej

9545901,0,t3_5bm0za,You can use RMB to move the Gamepad when it tells you to look up hold RMB and move your mouse around. Either because the low FPS some other emulation problem or maybe a fault of Splatoon itself you actually need to sit at that screen for quite a while so move the screen until screen is not faded out then tab away until you hear it make a sound.Another problem you are going to run into once you beat the tutorial is the fact you cant press ZL and ZR at the same time this is a fault of how CEMU treats the triggers on controllers. To get past this change your ZL ZR L and R from this to thisOnce past the start screen press TAB and click Options then disable motion controls.Also L and R are swapped so when told to click R click L or swap them in the controls menu as well.,cemu,d9pq9sy,3,t5_3abej

This required me to delete my precompiled and transferable caches as well as my NVIDIA GLcache which is built the first time Cemu builds a cache for a game after that it seems its just loaded from that location in appdata. After deleting all  caches and leaving cemu to generate its own shaders there was no slowdown in that same area.Another user with the same graphics card as me has described the same problem.

10508654,0,t3_5qgda5,I had your issue as well but I fixed it by doing the following  Reinstall Cemu.  Configure both the gamepad in controller slot  and pro controller in slot .  Change CPU setting to Host based timer.  Activate Zelda WW HD reduced bloom graphic pack.  DONT add cached shaders.    This is what I did and I had perfect fps in outset all the way until getting to dragon roost island from there fps tanked as usual....which is normal for everyone for that area to tank in fps.

Hell we have graphics packs allowing cemu to force the game to internally run at k then send out an image to our own resolution.Really though just try it for yourself. If you see hard stutters where it freezes for a second those are shaders getting cached. It only does it the first time so after a run through of a game it will be pretty solid.If only there were some set of words to google  or some subreddit to help you fill your CEMU CACHES.Wink wink.Dont ban me,cemu,dfbwpi2,5,t5_3abej

11298956,0,t1_dfcd1tm,It took quite a bit of tinkering but the only way I could get it to work was by following these steps.. Make sure you load Cemu.exe through Steam Add it as a non steam game.  You can also make it automatically load directly into games using the Cemu Path f g Game Path as targets. For set up purposes you just need to add Cemu.exe so you can config your controller.. I could only get this to work properly when I had two controllers connected to the steam link.  I dont have a steam controller so I used two PS ones.  The first of which in Cemu was only read as a keyboard while the second was being read as a X controller.  The X controller let me config my button layout just fine..  I then opened Cemu.exe through Big Picture Mode on the Steam link in my basement and then went upstairs to my PC.  I was able to navigate the input options with my MK on my desktop and set up the controller.. I had my controller configurations for nonsteam controllers on the desktop set to gamepad. I am not sure if that step is actually needed though.. Once your controller is setup you dont have to keep the second one connected.  It works for me just fine now.  Technically you could just map it as a keyboard though if you dont have a second controller.,cemu,dfcpx53,1,t5_3abej

11523791,0,t1_dg27thz,Im comparing it to the last guide I wrote that instructed to keep all shaders in GLCache.This is a temporary folder that resets itself after a PC restart which caused long compiling every time you started your PC again. This one fixes that while still keeping the files on the SSD making the game faster.For the HDD users the shaders wont be divided into two parts one in GLCache and one in precompiled but all kept in precompiled. That seems to help with the crashes and makes them almost nonexistent at least in my case but other people also reported long sessions without a crash. Ill update the guide with my nvidia settings and more info when I wake up.Also sorry if this doesnt make sense ,cemu,dg2828f,1,t5_3abej

11627003,0,t1_dgdwwvn,What Ive read is that Sega had an april fools day announcement where they posted a link to a steam page where you could download an bit simple shooter bayonetta game. Then at the same time they put up a countdown timer on their website. When the timer ran out they unexpectedly announced the Steam port of Bayonetta  and the bit Bayonetta game was taken down the day after. It was never a nintendo game  the first title was created by platinum games and published by sega for PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox consoles. However they couldnt find funding for the project of its sequel Bayonetta  and the project was shelfed... until Nintendo agreed to fund Bayonetta  on the condition that they control the publishingdistributiton rights. When Bayonetta  reached near the end of its production phase PlatinumGames said that it was feasible for them to make a port of the first game to be also released on Wii U so the first batches of Bayonetta  were shipped in a box set with the first game. Thus the first game wasnt ever caught up in the contract and Platinum was free to port it to PC without waiting for NIntendos approval.,cemu,dgdxln6,2,t5_3abej

Major versions are restricted for overarching updates that change things dramatically performance UI etc minor versions are for planned fixes and small internal backend logic changes patches are for hot fixes usually bugs.All of these standards are just that a guideline for developers not requirements and can thus be changed.gtModern computer software is often tracked using two different software versioning schemesan internal version number that may be incremented many times in a single day such as a revision control number and a released version that typically changes far less often such as semantic versioning or a project code name.,cemu,dgk7fkk,1,t5_3abej
