6815930,0,t1_d0ouogy,My wife and I are taking a packet of IDs birth records and other official documents to be certainmake a point.Last time my wife Asian decent and registered democrat was unable to vote while I was whiteunaffiliated.  At the time they said her ID had the wrong address and some other random problems that seemed iffy... Ever since then I always feel overly suspicious of the process. ,NorthCarolina4Sanders,d0ovt2c,5,t5_380vz
6861252,0,t1_d0tzdvh,Yeah thats it! That is from before they allowed sameday registration though so thats likely why a lot of ballots are thrown out due to the registration after deadline.Just go with a valid photo ID and ask for a provisional ballot because youre with the wrong party. Theyll print it out check off the box for you and show you how to vote! Theyll ask if you want to be listed democrat or unaffiliated can vote for Bernie as either! and your party affiliation will automatically be updated even if the vote isnt accepted. Totally worth a shot! ,NorthCarolina4Sanders,d0u16cl,1,t5_380vz
