However if youre easily offended by racial slurs it might not be the best movie for you to watch. Ah yes its black out. EditHoly shit I cant believe no one has said this! But Delamas.

1187799,0,t1_ci31lm8,Its definitely a good start but its not the whole story. Inanimate objects can sit as well but not in the same way that humans or animals sit. Take a look at the infamous example of keys in a pocketDe sleutels zitten in mijn zak  The keys sit in my pocketWhy dont keys lie in pockets? Nobody knows thats just the way it is. From what I can gather zitten for inanimate objects roughly means that it is in an enclosed space.Het boek ligt op tafel  The book is lying on the tableHet boek zit op tafel  not possibleHet boek zit in de doos  The book is sitting in the boxOf course to annoy second language learners objects in an enclosed space can still be standing up or laying down when their orientation is very obviously horizontal or vertical like bottles of milk or brooms.De bezem staat in de schuur  The broom is standing in the shed?De bezem zit in de schuur  The broom is sitting in the shedLong story short there are general rules but there are also lots and lots of examples that just dont make logical sense. E.g. paint sits on the wall sailors sit on the sea bikes stand in sheds letters stand on the paper and so on.,learndutch,ci38vfv,1,t5_2t6rf

1576276,0,t1_cj9xo8v,As explained by oonniioonn youre thinking about this way too much in your own american? context. You should really look into the history of Hollandthe dutch language before you say things like the taalunie cannot prescribe the dutch language because thats not what happens here.But appart from the start of the ABN algemeen beschaafd nederlands  general social dutch? the name for the common dutch as it described in the dictionaries and such the taalunie and likewise organisations change their definitions rules about the language and vocabulary to match the dutch spoken in holland. THEY ARE DESCRIPTIVE NOT PRESCRIPTIVE.And in that regard als can be used wrongly because it is not yet accepted as correct grammar because theres only a very small amount though growing of the population using it incorrectly.,learndutch,cjdv1j5,0,t5_2t6rf

7422105,0,t1_d2luceo,Youre pretty much correct. Only two things and this goes for OP as well. Its not omdaat its omdat. Only  a in that word. Also want and omdat have slightly different meanings. Example.   Why have you bought those bananas?    Because I was hungry. Waarom heb je die bananen gekocht?    Omdat ik honger heb. You cant transform that sentence to use want.Want is usually only used in explanations by the first person. Het is nat buiten want het regent. it is wet outside because its raining You could also say    Het is nat buiten omdat het regent. But you cant say    Waarom is het nat buiten?    Want het regent. In that case its omdat het regent. Or in the case of daarom   Het regent daarom is het nat buiten.   Its raining thats why its wet outside.Daarom means more like thats why.,learndutch,d2lufeb,13,t5_2t6rf
7423378,0,t3_4gyfiw,Daarom means thereforesobecause of that. Omdat means because and is a subordinating conjunction. You also have the word want which is very similar to omdat but is a coordinating conjunction. This means that omdat is followed by a SOV word order omdat ik hem zie while want is followed by a SVO word order want ik zie hem.There is also a slight difference in meaning between want and omdat. want is said to illustrate a more subjective cause A want B  I think A and use B as an argument A omdat B  A is caused by B,learndutch,d2lzmw9,4,t5_2t6rf
