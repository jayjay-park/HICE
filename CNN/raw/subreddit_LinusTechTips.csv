6139686,0,t1_cynieyb,So you are telling me what i think? I never said i was helping or implied it.  text based communication can leave somethings up to interpretation so your confusion is understandable I simply poked fun at the fact he missed something that was the focal point of an entire shot that lasted over  seconds. Must have been a  very late night editing session for him. You are making a big deal out of nothing. Nothing at all. ,LinusTechTips,cyninlz,1,t5_2v5ru

6420435,0,t1_czg88po,I have  external monitors one has mini display port one uses HDMI both now connected directly to my  MBPr and solely running OS X. Say now I got a eGPU and I think I have these options to wire them upOption  both external displays connected to the eGPU then connect the eGPU to the MBPr via TBOption  connect the eGPU to MBPr via TB then the external display connected to MBPr via HDMIMDportOption  connect the HDMI display to the eGPU then connect eGPU to MBPr then the display has MDport will go into the other TB port of the laptopuDschijn as you replied external monitors have to connect to the GPU itself to get the performance so I think  will be a more optimal solution. But I actually prefer  if I will end up w. similar results since I cant find a GPU that has a MDport and also within my budget currently thinking about THIS ONE What do you think?Also I read your post saying that we should only connect one PSU to the card. So if I get the Dell DA PSU and plug that into the card then I dont need to plug in the stock PSU to power up the dock? I know I might have asked way too many questions here and hijacked the thread here sorry about that just wanna make sure everything goes according to my plan before I put my  down for it. Thanks!,LinusTechTips,czjer5e,2,t5_2v5ru

I know the prepay offer is technically better value but always comes with the caveat that they could revoke it at any time plus the fact its a day thing and theres enough horror stories of people getting gouged for going one day outside of that.,LinusTechTips,d6016hq,1,t5_2v5ru

10766414,0,t1_ddqgk5p,I would be far too terrified to even transport it I have really heavy GPUs so I take those out and transport them separately I dont even know how I would deal with heavy crystals held on with hot glue. He should take all the crystals out and epoxy them onto acrylic sheets then screw the sheets to the case. If he is confident in the strength of the glue then I trust his judgement I guess Its his rig so he probably did what he thought was the best way of doing it While I personally would have gone a different direction I respect his decision with his personal rig.,LinusTechTips,ddqh540,2,t5_2v5ru

11319971,0,t3_61ihod,I would recommend stress testing your CPU using something like AIDA.I had an issue like this last year turned out my CPU was thermal throttling without realizing it. Might be the same issue but its hard to say if you test it with AIDA and it gets the point of thermal throttling then we know thats the issue.,LinusTechTips,dff3lm1,7,t5_2v5ru
11350971,0,t3_6202y2,There is a link on the forum to report it or maybe it was just a contact link Will edit when I dig it up but Id just send a email through the forums contact page. Probably want to bring it to Coltons attention I think that is his department. ,LinusTechTips,dfim136,13,t5_2v5ru
