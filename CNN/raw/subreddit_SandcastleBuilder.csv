35025,0,t1_cehuoqj,Im running into the same problem. Duplication is at x my Glassed Lightning is at  which seems weirdly low and I think I remember it being higher and I cant seem to get Lucky Twin to do much of anything for me. I just found looking through other threads that it looks like you need to activate a bunch of Not Lucky during a single Temporal Duplication in order to make it permanent. Im completely puzzled about how to do this though! I never seem to get Not Lucky from Caged Logicats and I dont get Redundakitties quickly enough to keep Duplication doing. Any ideas what Im missing here?EDIT Never mind... Time Lord did it for increasing TD time. Still puzzled on the x though.,SandcastleBuilder,ceif3lp,2,t5_2yrvc
36152,0,t1_ceieeny,Heh unintended consequence!  Im changing not having either of AE or AA will cause the lesser number of runs so you dont need to do  the blackprints needed for AA to build AA.,SandcastleBuilder,ceijpze,2,t5_2yrvc
62163,0,t1_celfidd,Ah I had missed Shadow Dragon.  Im getting close to it.gt Yes getting Glassed Lightning  times once every mNP is how many of us managed Infinite tools and its a real pain. Yeah I cant imagine being stuck in this section this long.  Flipping back to the game every mNP has gotten extremely boring already and I dont think I could do it  times.  Id have to finally give in and make an autoclicker something that I really dont think should be necessary.  ,SandcastleBuilder,celi9oj,2,t5_2yrvc

259687,0,t1_cf6vf5x,gt The boosts are listed in the order they have been generated which is the code order sometimes the Wiki is behind with new boosts not yet added to it sometimes it is up to date sometimes it is up to date with commited patches that have not yet been released as now sometimes it is even ahead of the code!The fact that they are in order may be helpful but sometimes things are referenced without any context. For example I have all boosts up to Achronal Dragon but this boost references temporal duplicates which are not mentioned until that boost or seem to be defined anywhere other than the source of course.,SandcastleBuilder,cf7obuc,1,t5_2yrvc

268286,0,t3_1x3y7e,You should probably mention that blast furnace for castles is pretty much worthless without fractal sandcastles as without them you get a  ratio of sand to castles.

662263,0,t3_21qgq4,Hmm... If the effect of vacuum renders AA level negligible then by my crude calculations at around  It Sucks level idling around for infinite blackprints is the far better solution than building it up progressively.Meaning if I get time dilation and black hole my vacuum production will be multiplied by .  I believe I can hit MM vacuum before I can upgrade This Sucks to  assuming current rate of increase remains stable for levels ,SandcastleBuilder,cgfjrwz,1,t5_2yrvc
662427,0,t3_21l0yy,I know it has been said for the shop but Im not sure if its been said for the tools so Ill say it here.If you have your layout arranged in such a way that you have to scroll to see all your tools perhaps when expanded they will also snap upwards after about a second.,SandcastleBuilder,cgfkg1g,2,t5_2yrvc

831862,0,t1_cgyl5fm,Thats a good move.As a general comment to anyone apparently running out of the game the Dragon saga is under active development.  It will be worthwhile players getting the CDSP high getting all the Maps you can getting AC as high as you can I know this will get tedious.,SandcastleBuilder,cgyu2qj,3,t5_2yrvc
835330,0,t3_23p7th,a ninja is when you ninja the NewPixBots or NPBs by clicking the NewPix before the NPBs have activated. When there is a ONG a timer will appear in the NPB description. If you click the NP before this timer runs out you will ninja the NPB. In the begining of the game you want to avoid this but later it becomes necessary to get certain stuff. A streak is when you ninja or dont the NPBs on multiple NPs in succession.Also the Wiki does say something about ninjas,SandcastleBuilder,cgz89q9,2,t5_2yrvc

1038856,0,t3_260427,You have many more than enough duplicates for that stage.Make sure stats mode is turned off this applies to both castle and classic layouts.Once it is off you just need to click destroy on the Achronal Dragon.Also needs stats mode off but you might want to reinstall the nav code I dont think it pays to have it uninstalled outside of a few specific grinds.In classic I believe you turn stats off by switching back to newpix view and in castle it is an option in the panes list between the one for Castle Tools and Layouts if it is the same order for you as me.,SandcastleBuilder,chmdf9a,1,t5_2yrvc

1480134,0,t1_cj1s9zn,I should point out that though I have several masterpieces Im not really a candidate for the lead. Ive been making pretty heavy use of custom scripts to automate various features with my rule being that I do it manually for at least  days before automating it.As such I have a script running that automatically lays eggs and freezes dragons which means my number of fledged dragons is way above what you could manage without such a script. Currently Im at  dragons fledged which would be over  days of maximum dragon breeding i.e.  days if you fledge  clutches of  a day and thats not counting dragons replaced or lost fighting.I think uXilwarg is in the lead of the legitimate players.,SandcastleBuilder,cj1t6n5,1,t5_2yrvc

Dont run this one at the same time as the autofreeze one I posted it provides all the same functionality. autofledgeDoFledge  If true fledges dragons at autofledgeNP. autofledgeNP will be automatically lowered if the current NP has equal or better dragons so if your dragons arent dying itll move itself downwards if they are dying itll just continue fledging there letting you farm losses with dignity. If autofledgeDoFreeze is true this setting will be ignored and no automatic fledging will occur. autofledgeDoFreeze  If true freezes dragons after theyve been fed. Overrides autofledgeDoFledge. autofledgeDoFeed  As expected if true it will automatically feed dragons as they hatch. This one is actually obviated by an ingame boost Robotic Feeders I think hence why I have it disabled. autofledgeNP  You should set this to the highest NP at which you wish to attempt fledging. If your dragons are able to survive fledging and any redundaknight fights you start this will fill up every NP eventually. Obviously ignored if the script isnt fledging.Oh and I forgot my autoegglaying script    var autoeggamount      var autoegg  setInterval        function                    ifMolpy.BoostsEggs.Level lt autoeggamount                            ifMolpy.SpendBonemeal Molpy.EggCost                                    Molpy.AddEggs                                      You can set autoeggamount to whatever you wish. Theres no real disadvantage to having it set to  instead of the max you can afford. If you need to change egg linings set it to .If you have diamond masterpieces set it to the max you can afford or set it to Infinity which will automatically purchase the max. If youre fledging more than  dragons per clutch further dragons will add less time than normal.Dragons  add  mNP  dragons  add  mNP  dragons  add  mNP  rounded up dragons  add  mNP  etc.,SandcastleBuilder,cj3i5tl,1,t5_2yrvc

2223736,0,t3_2kkw2w, is when Barons show up.  Barons are hard.You actually need high offense moreso than high defense to get through Barons.  Its not enough to survive them hitting you you have to actually defeat them for it to matter.The only real solution to Barons with Wyrms is to have  glass cannon fully offensive Wyrms in each NP.  But fledging anything past about NP  means a rapidly increasing probability of Redundaknights just kicking your poor Wyrms teeth in with very little probability of success.  Anything above  Barons is very hard to beat with any sort of consistency even with   Wyrms.,SandcastleBuilder,clmhnlb,2,t5_2yrvc

So Flux Crystals are your main priority right now. You want to get Time Lord over  so you can get Fertilizer. Fertilizer gets more powerful the more Bonemeal you have so be upping your Dragon Forge whenever you can afford the max increment. CDSP will also somewhat help with this which you want to upgrade with Mustard at this point...Mustard income will dramatically increase once you get Cress but thats  levels of CDSP from where you are.

Your NPB amount will be increased by  temporal duplicate NPB. These particular ones are referred to as invader NPBs but they are the same as any other temporal duplicate except that they come from time travel trips and only when you have less than  duplicate NPBs.You just need to keep track of how many NPBs you had before the spam and then youll know when you have  extras. I believe the code is written so that if you try to sell a tool that has duplicates present you will just erase a duplicate and get nothing even if you bought a normal copy afterwards so you may end up wanting to destroy all thirty before buying real ones again depending on how much time travel costs to get  duplicates compared to the price of the tool.,SandcastleBuilder,d8tjmni,1,t5_2yrvc
