865506,0,t1_ch2h5fr,gtHarder alloy jacketed bullets slower loads check timingalignment check cylinder throat size...Yeah I shoot LRN due to the cheaper prices. Not planning to change that. Timing is great but throat could possibly be opened. gtTop strap??!! Holy crap I might expect that if I shot k rounds through it between cleaning... The gun gets cleaned well after every outing. Just a pain cleaning it. Just curious if anyone had any tips.,Revolvers,ch2nw0b,1,t5_2u89e
1909110,0,t1_ckiljsl,Yeah I was only going to get a leather belt and holster for it it just seems wrong to not use leather for a revolver. For all of the reasons you just said that is exactly why I want it haha,Revolvers,ckj8hmi,1,t5_2u89e

6594899,0,t3_46027y,Like most anything that produces lemons the lemons get a lot of publicity. Taurus makes rather spectacularly bad lemons and makes them more frequently than other companies but they wouldnt still be afloat as a company if anywhere near the majority or even a sizeable fraction of their guns were lemons. My guess is that at most  of them are bad from the factory and up to another  break in some way that shouldnt happen after heavy use. In truth youre most likely going to get a perfectly good and functional gun from Taurus and Id be happy to own one if I knew the previous owner and had seen them use the gun for thousands of rounds before they sold it to me but I personally wouldnt buy one that didnt have a history I was intimately familiar with. Not because I think all Tauri are trash but because they have a much higher lemon rate than others that are out there and I for one have a low tollerance for lemons even if they are still in the minorityThat said if your gun works more power to you! All you need now is to put several hundred rounds through it and see if it has longevity which it most likely will but Ill still be crossing my fingers for you until you know fore sure.,Revolvers,d01gt8d,4,t5_2u89e
