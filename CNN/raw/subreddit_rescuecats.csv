2139246,0,t3_2jdyos,I hope you find people willing to adopt these beautiful cats. The grey and white one is quite charming. I dont live in Texas so I am not sure if these are close enough but here are some places to look into,rescuecats,clbquqc,2,t5_2ryhw
2325878,0,t3_2lvv7v,While looking for a new home you might try holistic remedies since it seems like you have tried everything else.  Rescue Remedy which is an oil that can be bought at Whole Foods and some pet stores can be put directly on the cat or in their water to help them to feel more relaxed.  I have seen it work wonders for some cats who have spent time in a cage at the Petco I volunteer at.  Jackson Galaxys Spirit Essences line also receives highly positive reviews  they are sold at Pet Sage in Alexandria Virginia for sure and are likely to be carried at other pet specialty stores as well.  Here is the link for their pageThe workers at Pet Sage are awesome at giving advice on supplements and essential oils I went to them when one of my cats developed stomatitis and they were amazing! so maybe they or the workers at another specialty pet store would have some other ideas.I know you havent made this decision lightly but I wanted to offer one more option to try since as a shelter volunteer I know how crowded the no kill rescue groups and shelters are at the moment.Edit FeliwayComfort Zone plugins work wonders too  you can get one at your local Petco or Petsmart as well as at the vet.  They smell musky for  hours but humans wont notice them after that.,rescuecats,clz6xfv,1,t5_2ryhw

5653404,0,t3_3jvm33,It might sound crazy but she may need a cat friend to help her out. Right now she doesnt know whats happening shes probably trying to figure out who you are and what you want. I would not recommend letting her out into the house at large just yet I would say into one larger room would be OK but you dont want her to hide and have so much distance between you that she never comes close. Canned food will help things theyre tasty and if she chooses to come out you have to avoid trying to pick her up or touch her too much at first.Whatever you do though just accept her for now the way she is and let her have her space. There is no guarantee with any animal how friendly or not theyre going to be but right now youve given her home and it would be terrible for her to go back to the shelter as a returned pet.,rescuecats,cwxuz0s,1,t5_2ryhw

6196222,0,t1_cytny9a,They only xrayed his chest I think they did a culture of the mucus to figure out it was calicivirus. Mold will make cats and people congested... Im thinking either bacterial or viral.,rescuecats,cyty0ff,1,t5_2ryhw

7863480,0,t3_4myz6e,You did the right thing.Also if you live in the United States a wonderful antibiotic ophthamalic ointment called Terramycin is available overthecounter and can be purchased at either feed stores or through Amazon and its perfect for clearing up eye infections.You keep the tip of the tube completely clean and never touch it to anything you can use it for multiple cats. Runs about  bucks. Will the shelter give you antibiotics in case they need them?Dont feel guilty you saved a couple of lives and you know what the people that are allowing their cats to get pregnant and then dropping the kittens at the shelter are irresponsible jerks. Do you guys have any kind of educational outreach or require the mother to come in and get spayed if they are dropping off kittens? That would be a good first step if you can talk someone into it.,rescuecats,d3zxdiy,3,t5_2ryhw
8631781,0,t3_4y3525,My wife found two kittens near her work. They appear to be brothers and seemed to be intentionally abandoned. When found a couple weeks ago they were in bad shape but always very loving. We cleaned them up and took them to our vet. They have been checked for Luekemia had their first round of shots first round of deworming and have a clean bill of health according to the vet. Paperwork from the vet can be provided upon meetup. These two have been through a lot together and it shows! They are extremely loving playful and sleep together all the time. They get along very well with our chihuahua older cat and our son. They are litter box trained and have been nothing but amazing. We can not afford to have two more kittenscats and it also voids the pet policy of our rent. If you live near Kansas City and are interested please message me and I can send you more info and pictures. Thanks!,rescuecats,d6kkuqm,1,t5_2ryhw
