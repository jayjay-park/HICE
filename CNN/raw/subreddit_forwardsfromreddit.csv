8569418,0,t1_d6bzrji,The argument is terrible but thats not the reason.Because its an argument against lesser of two evils voting it must start from the premise that both options are bad. How bad doesnt actually affect the quality of the analogy. Analogies have differences by definition and that doesnt invalidate them.There are actually two separate key problems. The first applies to the first and last example and that is that in those cases you have total control over the outcome. In an election your choice is constrained to two options and if you dont vote for one of those options you will have no impact on the outcome of the election. If you do vote for one of those options you will have a small impact.In the second example the problem is that it conflates voting with approval. Its completely possible to vote for Clinton while disapproving of her. If they had wanted the analogy to apply they would have to say something like Sure the supermarket sells poison food but their food is less poisonous than the other supermarkets so thats where I shop. The problem of course is that that would be rational. Everybody has to eat so if your only choices are poisoned food then of course your best bet is to choose the option with the least poison.,forwardsfromreddit,d6crb49,16,t5_2xt5g

11225749,0,t1_df4b4ii,gt I never said that transgender people do not exist or that being transgender isnt real or genuineGot it.gt I cant find where in my argument you would make the assumption that I would disagree with that.Id go back and try to look for it but a Im to tired to bother and b I know full well I was just making assumptions. Let this be a reminder to me that people can disagree with my definition of gender without being fullfledged stereotypical transphobes.gt transgender people are transitioning from one gender to another. Not one expression to another.Changing ones gender expression is part of transitioning A major part. In fact thats all that some people do.gt we shouldnt be helping people like Milo Stewart who say they are multiple genders essentially calling people who arent transgender inferior and then saying that people who disagree with them are oppressive.Amusing coincidence just today I came across this video that went into some detail on among other things just how badly people misrepresent Milo. If youre going to make claims against them Id like to see the original video for myself.gt Milo doesnt have gender dysphoria they just want to be special.. This doesnt follow.. Trans people can be trans without experiencing gender dysphoria. Source the APA FAQ. As usual I assume they know what theyre talking about.gt I feel that this reasoning can go on to justify genuine bigotry from those who claim to be sufferers of gender dysphoria but are actually not.Such as... the thing with Milo you mentioned above? Maybe this is just me but I find it hard to feel threatened by someone who gets so little attention and support. Or is there a bigger phenomenon Im unaware of?Also why specify but are actually not? If a dysphoric trans person wants to be a bigot whats stopping them?gt rapeNot touching this one I dont have time for another contentious topic.gt vaporwave and similar genres have objective definitions.Still not convinced.gt they are trivializing something that has roots in objectivity.On the one hand I see what youre saying and I cant necessarily deny that people might be overdoing it with the terminology.On the other hand this is where words come from. This is where words have always come from. People make up new words to describe new concepts and then those words live or die based on how many people use them. And people are more likely to use welldefined words that describe something useful.So heres my advice dont worry too much about vaporgender. It will only survive if it describes something worth describing and otherwise itll go away on its own data point of one Id never heard of it.,forwardsfromreddit,df4fahq,6,t5_2xt5g
