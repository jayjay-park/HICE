Broker fees can be very confusing and eventually I plan on writing a very succinct article explaining it. Keep a look out here for the link.. Get clients. Sales is a completely different process.  It takes a lot longer to go from start to finish and you have to be able to wether the storm in the event of bad luck.

11729955,0,t3_65jot9,Sorry just to be clear are you expecting to be the only apartment on the upper level? If so read no further.But if not Im planning to move out of my alcove studio at nd and Park Ave. by the end of August. Top floor of a six floor elevator building.  Carnegie Hill is a gorgeous neighborhood particularly if you like quiet. I can sleep with my windows open at night with no street noise.  I face the back of the building its off the avenue and have had zero problems with my neighbors.  Mainly young professionals and older folks.I pay  a month and Id be willing to move out more quickly than August if I find someone to take over the remainder of the lease.  Nothing wrong with the apartment we just need more space with two people and two cats.,NYCapartments,dgpmd47,1,t5_2sftr
