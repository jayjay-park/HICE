9963358,0,t1_datzrbc,Im stuck on compiling Weland... Have you done this before? Im getting some compile errors and I think it might be due to settings with visual studio but Im not sure what to do. I dont develop C so Im pretty much groping in the dark here.Any help would be appreciated.EDITI actually got the precompiled binary to finally work by copying all the gtksharpbin DLLs into the Weland folder. For some reason it just doesnt find them on its own but an SO thread pointed me in the right direction. Leaving this here for others who might hit the same roadblock.,Marathon,db692hi,1,t5_2qnt3
