4158792,0,t1_cru9k7v,I was thinking in an implimentation similar to that of Coinbase Vault where the user keeps two keys and the centralized service one of them. In a regular usage of the site the key from the service and one in possession of the user would be enough to move funds.But in the case of the service going down there is an open source tool available for free to recover the funds with the keys the user have.This is valid for the funds in the Localbitcoins wallet a different story is for the funds kept in escrow during an ongoing transaction between seller and buyer.,localbitcoins,cruba9u,3,t5_2x6nm

10060349,0,t1_dbi8eh1,Sometimes blocks come slowly and that causes delays. Sometimes people create more transactions that also. However usually the transactions flow pretty nicely. Transaction fees are probably going up along the bitcoin price and it makes more and more sense to use secondlayer solutions such as lightning network if possible.Currently LB doesnt use any secondlayer networks as all of those are in quite early stages. However we try to follow the development and maybe also take part to their development in the future.,localbitcoins,dbivyw7,2,t5_2x6nm
