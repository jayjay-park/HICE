5510455,0,t3_3pmanu,Ecotect is an older product and I dont think its supported anymore. A lot of the functions in Ecotect were migrated to both NavisWorks and an online Analysis system for Revit.,Autodesk,cwg0eba,1,t5_2vrt1

6560906,0,t1_czxn3t9,yeah well I guess anything from  should be good for a very long time to come. Especially for indie uses so I am fine with any final autodesk or adobe produce. the subscription model is pretty decent though now say my game takes off in a couple years and I make money off it I will then be more than willing to purchase the Maya LT subscription for  a month and go the legit way.For now I am just using a student copy I am not even using a pirated copy cause there is little point to that cause the student copy is the very same thing. If my game happens to make money I will invest in paying for Maya LT. Not because I have to but from a moral perspective. I used their product I made money I should in return do the right thing and give them their fair share. I think anyone with a moral compass would do the same. Even if Autodesk has no moral compass and is effectively the most evil company in North America after EA. I just cant stand blender the UI is so horrible. ,Autodesk,czxyahv,2,t5_2vrt1
