Averages is quite simple people not hitting enough   and s on a consistant basis.All this aside i really wish the BDO mugs jsut accept Hearns offer and just have one big Darts group.

216343,0,t3_1wleqf,Ive had this trouble a lot recently particularly the flight clipping my index finger on release ending up missing the board below the double  aiming for T. Im not a bad player its just on release Ive had awful problems almost as if Im trying to snatch the dart back before I throw it knowing itll be a bad throw if that makes sense.The best thing to do apparently is to practice and watch the the tip of the flight while its in your hand throw it at the board aiming nowhere in particular and watching the flight all the way into the board so youre getting used to how the trajectory should look from release to the board. Once that feels better try throwing as normal. Another thing that I sort of developed myself is concentrating on making the throw a full motion ie pulling the dart all the way back and releasing in one smooth motion at the same pace. I definitely believe  of the darts throw is psychological.Hope this in some way makes some sense.,Darts,cf333qx,1,t5_2qtyq

1553263,0,t3_2c17fy,Im going to agree and disagree here.  I think you just reach a level of diminishing returns.  For me if the dart is to light I spend a lot of muscle throwing the dart for it to hit and stick and make it hard for me to aim.  The cheap darts tend to be light.  Personally I like a g dart.  Now are my   tungsten darts that much better than some   darts? Probably not.  A lot of it comes down to preference and annoyance.  I used to use aluminum shafts but I found that they always seem to bend enter the nylon shafts.  Cheap flights seem to fall off easily and break enter Ruthless flights.At the end of the day Im a gear head and I like to play with my gear and darts has the advantage that generally the gear is cheap.But no gear is going to make you throw better like practice will.,Darts,cjaz3x2,11,t5_2qtyq

2265460,0,t3_2l55n9,Focusing on my target is the main reason for my improvement. Anytime Im having an accuracy issue its because Im not taking my time at the line not focusing and not following through. A friend once told me its like a free throw not a jump shot. Youll notice basketball players have their own routine for every foul shot they take. Whether its number of bounces spinning the ball in their hands etc. they do the same exact thing every time. Jumpers are just catch and shoot in rhythm. Ive taken to the mindset of doing the same routine every time. Foot to the oche line up the shot. Deep breath shoot and FOLLOW THROUGH. The issue for me is getting away from this during play. I just have to force myself to step back and line up again sometimes to reset myself. Works wonders for me. ,Darts,clrqb95,1,t5_2qtyq

This reinforced my personal experience.  Winmau rules.In the WDO final between Mitchell and Adams there was precisely one bounce out.  It was a real actual bounce out.  In the PDC final we had the Anderson    fiasco.  And of course poor Chizzy...  Darts do not ordinarily fall out of the board.I will cede the lighting to the PDC though.

3366374,0,t1_cpbylgw,The reason I ask is because I have limited exposure to the vast majority of the elite players in America and so didnt feel like I could get an accurate baseline just from a few experiences. Its also to gauge where Im at. I work  to  . hour days a week Currently working seven straight sitting behind a computer all day with no break. That means the little practice time I do get to have Im generally pretty tired or not very loose. Despite this Im still generally hovering around the  PPD area against good competition . I plan on hopefully sooner than later changing to something with a better schedule to allow me to have more consistent and regular play.Also was curious as I will be participating in the CDC what I will be facing. I know the quality of the top  guys its that  roughly that I was curious about. Figured if you had an idea of a baseline average I could use that as a general idea.

4209137,0,t1_crzjzfr,This is my second set of them a couple years old and my first was probably right about  years ago both were threaded...I prefer these shafts to the threaded for many reasons though...For one my threaded shafts always bent way too easy though I know the newer ones hold up a bit better and the ORings that came with them were horrible as well...I think in the first year I was throwing with them I went through half a dozen sets of metal shafts...And god forbid you have one of the connector screws break off in the barrel during a match...The push in style style also allows for just enough flight spin to be handy without the annoying rattle of traditional spinners...On top of that I like being able to vary the shaft length when I want.  Every now and then I have a rough night where I lose some stability in my throw so I just pull them out mm to smooth things out...Not to mention they are damn near indestructible...Only set I have been using for a couple years and I am just now starting to deal with a slight bend in one of them.,Darts,cs012dn,1,t5_2qtyq

4569043,0,t1_ct6ibx8,Honestly its just feel.The rules for darts shapes and sizes are pretty wide when you compare it to say tennis or snooker the variety of different darts thrown at all levels is just astronomical.Things to be aware of are barrel size weight and flight shapesize. Theres also stem and point length but I honestly dont think they are as important as the other three.When you are throwing them you need to feel comfortably holding them confidence you can throw them well and it needs to stick in the board in a that suits you.Some people like a really heavy direct throw some like a more lofty arched flight. Some people apply spin when then they throw others let them fly true. Some people like to throw them in pointing down some up and others flat.Really you need to just go somewhere and throw loads of different types and shapes and see what suits you.

Theres also a ton of pros that get by on pure skill instead of properly setting up shots for the best possible chances of winning. Darts is such a weird game. Some days we can all play incredible. Other days its like we just started. And that goes for everyone. Ive seen MvG win in a final with an upper ish avg. Ive also see him do a near  avg. Its hard to group players into categories imo. Or give them a label of how well they play. Look at Adrian Lewis for example. A top professional dart player by all means. But he averaged  on tv recently.

8383914,0,t3_4uge0o,Well Im no psychologist but heres my opinion. Ive noticed Phil starting to act strange during the World Championships. At first I thought the old man might be losing his mind like dementia or something lke that. But heres what I think it boils down to. Phil has said numerous times nd place aint shit. Easy to say when youve completely dominated for decades. I think the stress of his divorce losing his mom MVG has made him a beaten man.  MVG is better than him and he knows it. He just doesnt know how to handle it. So he panders to the crowd to make himself feel better makes gestures out of frustration etc. Phil is a warrior and has never needed any motivation to beat anyone. He was so cocky and full of himself he didnt need to. Now MVG clearly has his number and is in his head. I dont think Phil needs the money and most people would be happy being nd best and making a half million dollars a year. Thats not Phil though.  Its like alot athletes when they retire theyre so used to being famous and being in the spotlight all the time they start drinking doing drugs beating their wife etc.I think Phil is starting to see his career winding down and he just cant handle not being the man anymore so in a way this is him acting out.,Darts,d5pjd2m,10,t5_2qtyq

10230088,0,t3_5mfinv,Soft tip and steel tip are very different  I first played soft tip on an electronic board and had reached quite a good level frequent s and s then in later years I had to play steel tip and I was like a complete beginner and it has taken a lot of effort to get to a respectable level in steel tip too. The darts weight is different the mass distribution is different and they just dont fly the same so it takes some adjusting. Of course if you are really good it is much easier to move back and forth between the two go to YouTube and search for Phil Taylor playing electronic darts but most of us are nowhere near that level and if one is learning its probably best to just focus on one until you become really good.Also what is probably most important to you  bristle board and steel tip darts make a lot of noise too. I doubt there will be a significant difference between the two in terms of noise. ,Darts,dc3myvo,1,t5_2qtyq

10331856,0,t1_dcef15o,Thanks for commenting manmuch appreciated!As an unemployedunderemployed engineer I totally understand the gist of your reply.  Whenever youre taking up something be it darts or structural engineering theres not necessarily a bythebookdoitexactlythiswayoryoullneversucceedorthatbuildingwillcollapseandinstantlykillalloccupants approach.  Its a learning process.  Perhaps a lifelong learning process.  And as you approach a level of profiency in your professionhobby your experience is just a sum of of all the experiences others share with you.On that note most anyone can agree that more variables  more uncertainty.  And this is why the elbow crap has to go.  As I sorta said in another comment I knew how bad my elbow movement among everything else in my throw lol used to be.  But upon watching myself here I see that even on darts that felt good that were good theres still elbow movement.I think Im going to start my throw coming set with my arm parallel with the floor rather than pointing down at the  or even  degree angle seen in my video.  Less movement how could it hurt right?  Itll just take a few days to get used to but it should help my accuracy.  And my stamina.,Darts,dcf696g,1,t5_2qtyq

If you miss you lose. In that regard I think there is more pressure in softtip as there is less margin for error. At least in .  I think most people here have already stated its mostly people who hate change or think steeltip is harder so it  better... or something...

Quality over Quantity.  minutes of focused practice is better than hours of just lobbing it at the board. Educationally  minutes on task with breaks between is considered the optimal format for learning.   It really doesnt take much shoulder movement to throw so Id be concerned about your shoulder being the first thing that tires. The throw is generated by the movement of your forearm and wrist with the shoulder only moving up slightly at the end. Unless you are baseball throwing the dart youre not right you might want to have it looked at for medical issues.

11584963,0,t3_659jtj,Averages are funny things.  And progress is far from linear.I havent played much lately and I picked up my darts last night for about an hour.  It was rough.  Multiple legs of over  darts too many s for my taste but then suddenly I ripped off a  leg stretch where I averaged  darts a leg including my best leg being only  darts with a  in there  average for  legs.Then I threw a fifth leg and it took me  darts to finish  average.  My average for the whole session was probably closer to  or  darts a leg.  The point is darts is a fairly streaky game.  You get hot and then you cool off and thats also why I think you need long format matches to really know who is better.You will struggle at times you will regress at times.  It isnt a straight climb up the hill by any means.I do think there is a talent cap for each person there is a point where their mental ability and their physical ability just cant allow them to be any better.  If it were possible for a player to get perfect we would see guys averaging  at the top level.  There is enough money in the game for the best players to have incentive to dedicate every waking moment to becoming perfect.  But they arent perfect.But there is always a chance for improvement in this game no one is perfect everyone misses a few darts everyone can be better.The trick is to never accept that you have capped out that the level you are at is someone elses cap not yours.Any other mental state is the mindset of a failure winners never settle.,Darts,dg95v3t,3,t5_2qtyq
