7027103,0,t1_d1c8xd7,I have had friends tell me the same guy had a ten inch dick and a two inch dick with the same conviction. Those two phrases have a particular resonance. No one ever says five and three quarter inch dick or seven and a half maybe a little less... Any talk of size generally has more to do with an assessment of manliness in a general sense. And then theres the bizarre interpersonal politics in a gaggle of women. Their constant battles between each other for rank and whether any given girl in the pecking order has a right to claim status of some type of another... If she is low rank then saying her boyfriend has a huge cock is a threat to the alphas. And if she is of high rank she cant be seen as having a boyfriend with a tiny cock. Its like little girls at a tea party or something. ,averagepenis,d1cviqw,1,t5_2w0o4
