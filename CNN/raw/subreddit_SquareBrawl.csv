5471487,0,t3_3pyx6g,Im really disappointed that fast fall wasnt implemented. Movement is still unbearably floaty and theres many situations where dodging is impossible. I bought the game thinking that the dev would deliver what he promised but that didnt happen. We can only hope that hell continue to update it.Theres also new bugs like charging into walls gets you stuck inside of them. The game doesnt feel polished yet.,SquareBrawl,cwb18d7,0,t5_398xv
