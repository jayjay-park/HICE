Tap.gt She turned it over and I could see that the sticky dregs had run complex rivers and patterns over the white ceramic. But obviously I couldnt see. She became engrossed in reading the story mouthing words that I couldnt understand. The brown eyes that shone in candlelight became brooding and dark like the coffee. Seconds became minutes and I found myself leaning forward to hear her whispers maybe to try and share the future she was swimming through.She turned it over and I could see that the sticky dregs had run complex rivers and patterns over the white ceramic.this period should really be a comma and the B should be lowercase But obviously I couldnt see. Allinall a good story though. Nice use of imagery. ,writingcritiques,ckb2t78,1,t5_2xlzj
1842125,0,t3_2fo38h,Im new here too so hello fellow newbie!I think your cover letter is okay. Its not great nothing stands out to me. Your second paragraph starts out really well with your last position but then you get all bland. Very talented? Highly successful? You planned events from the beginning to the end? You did research to find donors? No doubt you did all of those things but those are the things I assume anyone will do. Those things are the bare minimum required for a mediocre level of success. Youre doing a lot of telling and not a lot of showing. Show me how your accomplishments were better than what I could do on my own.  To me this would make a better impressionIn my position as Senior Event Associate at nameofcompany I pushed my team to make every event successful. I communicated expectations with my team regarding deadlines and budgets in weekly meetings. Every year I managed the recurringfundraisername and despite the weak economy the event raised  more funds each year. After every event was over I held a final meeting to discuss what my team did well what could have been better and strategies to make sure future events avoided the difficulties we encountered. I always asked my team to strive for excellence and I believe my event management skills provided a framework for my employees to feel like they achieved excellence.Basically show me the strategies you use to be organized. Its great that youre proactive but how are you going to proactive at my company if youre a brand new hire? If you have fundraising numbers show me what you accomplished. Did you raise  at a bake sale? Did you raise  at pancake breakfast? Did you raise  at a charity auction? Show me what you achieved and how you achieved it.Also I feel like every cover letter should be tailored for the job youre applying for. I have one resume that shows off all the accounting work Ive done and I have another resume that shows off all the auditing work Ive done. When I was applying for a new job as an accountant or an auditor I used the resume that was most relevant to the position. When it came time for the cover letter I really paid attention to the vacancy announcement. If they asked for a selfmotivated friendly accountant I demonstrated those traits in my cover letter by telling them about the projects that I did on my own with no real deadline. If they asked for a detailoriented and independent auditor I told them all about how great I was at catching tiny little details and how I enjoyed independent studying in college. Now... for my disclaimer. I work for a government agency and I had little to no luck in the private sector when I applied for jobs. Ive been a hiring manager for many years though. Good luck in your search!,writingcritiques,ckb6829,2,t5_2xlzj

5778631,0,t1_cxd2wqu,Not a bad idea. Im afraid searching it well enough would bring up the b post though and Id get flagged for plagiarism of myself.  ,writingcritiques,cxde6h7,1,t5_2xlzj
9763281,0,t3_5dydhn,I really like the concept! To improve it I really think you need to justify the use of colloquiums. Let us know upfront whether this is first person or if this is a narrator telling a story. Otherwise it is jarring for readers to read nonstandard spelling. ,writingcritiques,dagjibb,2,t5_2xlzj
9933266,0,t3_5hnkb9,Its hard to see where youre going with this  though Im already interested in seeing what happens next. D I think the style does a great job drawing you in without being too detail heavy.,writingcritiques,db2bvp6,2,t5_2xlzj
10473337,0,t3_5p9s78,Okay no ones critiqued yet so Ill do my best to go as in depth as I can of you.  Just for the record I used to be a creative writing profs. assistant so Im not the best there is but ive got quite a few critiques under my belt. And of course Im procrastinating with my own writing and Ive got some time so here goes.I dont mean to degrade in anything I say.  that being said I want you to have something to work off of so I will be blunt.  You dont really have to take anything Ive said to heart but its something good to think on for sure.First thing I noticed was the amount of commas.  Copious.  Most were used in correct manners as far as ruling goes but with that amount jammed into a sentence it can hinder the reading flow of the paragraphs as a whole.  Admittedly its a problem that I have found myself battling for ever as well and not the easiest habit to break and sometimes if it helps the read fuck the rules.Ill come out and say that I wasnt overly hooked by the first paragraph.  A drankard describing his battle with keys is all too relatable relatable for myself an overage southern military member.  but that may not be enough to grab all the readers attention.  The best solution I can think of would be to have the action from Paragraph two start earlier on in paragraph one.  Maybe a loud ominous crack scares some of the drunk from his eyes and he feels the blood drop from his face a his head swivels in attempt to find the source. just right at the end of it to set the tone that this is going to be a horror story.  dont give too much information that the next section losses its effect but just enough to give the feeling.  Its something to play around with.Mixture of tenses for instance It occasionally felt like someone else was in here...  from Pgr. .  Now this isnt the most blatant misuses ive seen and honestly could pass fine without revision if you wanted the story written as happening instead of in past but there were others scattered throughout.  Again minor rule violations are alright if it helps the readability.  Its entertainment not MLAmazment.Im not sure how he would know the noise was a harp heavy knife or cleaver just by hearing it.  the readers by this point know this is a horror story and giving them less information about a sound may actually be more intense than telling them what its going to be.The head reveal can be drawn out.  you could easily shove another hundred word in there and i dont think it would hinder the piece at all.  Add some panic some fear into the process as he tries to find the door.  Let us discover with him... or her... Ive been presumptuous but may be something to clear up if you wish to do so.  though I dont think gender typing in writing is too important. anyway let us discover the head with him as he tries to figure it out for himself.  Maybe with his hands or by bumping into it and having it fall from the door into a section of light.  something bigger than just noticing.Theres a load of adjectives.  which isnt always a good thing.  But i only really was bothered by them at the end and in particular two lines.  I saw nothing but abyssal emptiness inside them with a hint of what I could only describe as sadistic insanity.  One line I suppose.   abyssal emptiness is kind of redundant.  And insanity in the Mains situation is quite positively going to be sadistic.   A good rule of thumb is to try to make the writing tell the story while using as little words as possible. everything should have a point and there shouldnt be any filler.That all the rule issues I have to mention so well move on the the arch and plot.The Character feels to be missing something and I apologize for not knowing what I mean.  Best I can figure the length of the story hinders the inner narrative a little too much for me to grow close but thats a problem with many shorts specially rnosleeps?As far as the antagonist  I liked it.  Again I wish there was a little more to go on but the idea was a neat one.  There just seems to be more story in your mind than what has made it to the screen and dont be afraid to add more. It had a beginning and a middle but the end was more of a stop.  not something that is always a end all and in this case I believe it fits but it did come up on my quick.  I feel a little more pain for the Character in the end would do the story well and leave the reader a little more scared of the dark after reading.All in all though not bad.  Could use a revision or two for plot and minimal errors but youve got a good stone.  Polish it up and itll shine. I wrote this in the comment box so excuse my is and horrible formatting.,writingcritiques,dcv9egd,2,t5_2xlzj
