From a practical standpoint I dont think the same seat each night is possible. I think he has to look for a body type that is acceptable for the action and the people change every night. A larger person wont work cause he needs access to the arm rests without obstruction.

3837669,0,t1_cqrk6ym,Im really happy to read this makes my heart warm thank you! I feel for the younger folks in the production having to deal with all the press the past few days. When I was in just the small community theatre as a sensitive kidtween Id get VERY upset if an adult that saw it made a joke about how cheap a costume looked or how they shouldve gone with another kid for the lead etc  cant imagine what that feels like on a worldwide platform. I know they have a great community around them though  But yes as I mentioned in a reply below  I realize now I was being quite naive in my post above. I was on a possibly very irrelevant tangent thinking I might have a good point and I hadnt assessed all the reviewspress as well as Id thought. Granted opinions are just that theres certainly a lot more that Ive read in the past  days that point many similar opinions on the shows issues.,Broadway,cqtq72e,1,t5_2qudv
3912090,0,t1_cr26tax,Idina carrying the show is interesting because it seems to have both helped and harmed the show.

When I saw it the general feeling on the audience during intermission seemed to be What the hell is going on? Why am I watching this?

4117077,1,t3_37ssvq,My main problem with this song is that too many of the jokes are in specific and blatant references to other shows. Les Miserables may be popular now but in ten years that joke might not land at all. Besides its kind of cheap lets laugh because Les Mis doesnt have talking. Something well done I think is in the dance break where in the brass you can hear snippets from Gypsy West Side Story and The Music Man but its all in the same style as the general dance music. So if you know those tunes and catch them in the dance youll smile at the reference but if you dont get the reference it doesnt make a difference because it doesnt seem out of place. The ideal reference is one that if you dont get it its not conspicuous so while you might not be getting everything out of it youre still not losing anything.,Broadway,crpkmpt,0,t5_2qudv
4258153,0,t3_39qrfw,Very cool to hear.For my money Carious is still the best. I know a lot of people prefer Hearns but I think Cariou sang it a bit further down which makes it that much more demonic. The less said about Depps the better.,Broadway,cs5m1fs,2,t5_2qudv
4297690,0,t3_39abwi,I loved Phantom but I can see how people wouldnt. I absolutely love Les Mis as well but I loved Les Mis for much longer and love it more. I like the effects story and music but really most of it is personal preference. It also kind of depends on what actors you get as they may inhabit the characters better. The big three musicals are Phantom Les Mis and Wicked but theyre all very very different. Id say Phantom is more classical music and romance while Les Mis is more dramaaction and Wicked is more fun than the first two. Broadway doesnt really translate into one type of musical. For example there is a difference between musicals that have names like Music of The Night and Spooky Mormon Hell Dream just as an example.,Broadway,csa2msy,2,t5_2qudv

The main issue I had was that he had a really difficult time remembering his lines and because he spent so much time trying to find where he was in the story the necessary character depth and connection with the audience wasnt there.

You will cry.Others that might fit the bill are Chicago Fiddler on the Roof Phantom of the Opera The Color Purple and Fun Home. Some are heavier that others but all have some element of what seem to be looking for whether because their dark or because they deal with heavier subjects.Two shows that are not currently on Broadway but you should check out if you ever have the chance are Spring Awakening and Next to Normal.

So if the last batch was through Feb  the next would prob only cover March and April  for example.Chicago sitdown wont go on sale until May or later but will be covering the period of Sept Jan  to start. Its a bigger house so more chances of getting a seat although some sight lines will royally suck.

With a show like Avenue Q which is playing off Broadway and has been there for ages you shouldnt have any trouble getting tickets. The TKTS booth you mentioned is great you just need to have some picks in mind before you get into the line so that you see something you know about and want to see.

10749029,0,t3_5tqq7r,One of my favourite aspects of the stage production is that Cathy and Jamie never actually interact with each other on stage until The Next Ten Minutes when their respective timelines intersect.  That was completely absent from the movie though admittedly I can understand why since it might not have translated well enough to cinema audiences.I didnt mind the movie otherwise.  Ive definitely seen much worse and Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan did a good job with the cast recording.,Broadway,ddoohtd,3,t5_2qudv

10888543,0,t3_5ve4vi,If youre going to one of the shows you listed I recommend Book of Mormon. Its great fun.That said all of those musicals are institutions of Broadway at this point and they arent budging anytime soon. They also have tours so you dont really need to see them in NYC.Personally I would recommend Great Comet of . Seeing Great Comet felt like it was my first show all over again. Dear Evan Hansen is another one to consider. Tickets are selling really well though so it probably only works if your visit is a few months from now.,Broadway,de32qjd,2,t5_2qudv

11184231,0,t3_5z61zg,I love Idina Menzel but shes one of the most boring Elphabas to me. Ive seen Wicked live  times  and watched a few bootlegs and each time I leave thinking that the Elphaba I saw was better when it comes to acting amp vocals than Idina. Though I will admit I saw Idina live and was too young to really remember much about her but from a few videos shes pretty lackluster in that role. I cant even listen to OBC album version of No Good Deed without getting bored. My personal favorite is Donna Vivino. She kills it. ,Broadway,dezpx3y,1,t5_2qudv

The songs were charming in the first act but I felt like they tried to shoehorn too much from the film and it made the second act sloppy and unmemorable. The sets were imaginative in a way that compliments the tone of the story. But I wouldnt call this a mustsee and I dont think it will get any attention at the Tonys.,Broadway,dgeywap,8,t5_2qudv

In London though there are SO many booths in leicster square to get cheap tickets in fact the tkts booth is usually not the best deal. I studied abroad there when I was a broke college student as still saw at least  shows a week its so much more affordable then NY. I usually paid between  USD on tickets while I was there saw a ton and never had a terrible seats. ,Broadway,dgh8odf,0,t5_2qudv
