3738741,0,t1_cqifpdz,Ive actually been involved and written my share of free software for a long time. I do realise what Im saying. If someone cant spare  mn to write a readme I wont spare mn to second guess what the software does.OSS doesnt mean you should take your users for fools.,kubernetes,cqifva3,3,t5_33f68
4897311,0,t3_3hmf0g,You seem to have told kubelet that your domain is kubernetes.test.local  did you also tell kubesky and skydns that same thing?I ask because it is different than the default and easy to miss.Nothing looks obviously wrong from the logs.  You might try cranking v up on kubesky.,kubernetes,cubufgy,1,t5_33f68
8606461,0,t3_4xph3d,I have no experience with rancher. Also please use code formatting for the logs so its a bit more readable Have you checked if there is a service for master in whatever namespace the ingress controller is running in? It looks like its trying to reach the ks APIserver which is normally located at kubernetes.default.,kubernetes,d6hei2z,2,t5_33f68
9261321,0,t3_577esg,Nice!One thing Ive not seen covered... does kubeadm deploy addons? I know it doesnt deploy dashboard but surely it deploys kubedns?Whats the plan for that longer term? I havent seen an issue for that on GH yet. Ive seen lots of others that sigclusterlifecycle get tagged in.,kubernetes,d8pxtp4,1,t5_33f68
10211305,0,t3_5m71qo,For scaling the number of ks nodes you should use You probably dont need to scale the master nor etcd  and even more unlikely that you need to do it dynamically ,kubernetes,dc1ic1m,2,t5_33f68
10461168,0,t1_dcszwg4,Thanks again for the kops support just curious what you or anyone else sees kops missing as it stands?,kubernetes,dctvoh6,1,t5_33f68
10920137,0,t1_de6bvcz,True but it sounds like these systems are overlapping and largely mutually exclusive. There must be some cost to maintaining and targeting two overlapping systems that would give you incentive to at least unify them somehow. For example I imagine that you have some continuous delivery system in place across Google that needs to know whether to deploy a project using Kubernetes or Borg.,kubernetes,de6c358,1,t5_33f68
