741588,0,t3_22mtp0,I definitely recommend spokes. They have two open shop days every week. Lots of space tools and used parts and some new parts too. The mechanics have always been helpful when Ive needed them. Sunrise usually has some stands and tools available for use but there may or may not be a mechanic available to help you especially if they are busy. ,CyclingMSP,cgoknrz,1,t5_2sla8
803255,0,t1_cgtu2uo,I gave up on yelling at cyclists running red lights last august. Flipping the cyclist the bird gives me equal satisfaction and allows motorist an opportunity to see a cyclist enraged at a law evading cyclist.When I yell most motorists dont know who I am yelling at due to recent innovation of soundproofed motor vehicles but they do know who I am giving the finger to.,CyclingMSP,cgvl0mi,0,t5_2sla8

4941566,0,t3_3iguym,My rationale is that traffic control signals exist for two reasons safety and traffic flow control.Since passing through a traffic control on a bicycle with caution doesnt have the same safety issues especially to others that it does in a car it is acceptable. Those issues that exist for a car running a lightsign that arent there for a bike are primarily sight and hearing issues on a bike I can hear a squirrel crossing the road  in a car I can barely hear another car next to me. Basically a cyclist can make an accurate reading of the risks before proceeding in a way that a driver cannot.Traffic flow control doesnt apply the same way to cyclists as it does for automobiles simply because of traffic density. Until bike miles go through the roof a bike ignoring the pacing provided by a control signal doesnt impact traffic flow in any significant way.,CyclingMSP,cuhf9di,1,t5_2sla8

5020822,0,t1_cur3tuc,I was thinking the same thing about the woman parking. And yeah I wish people knew cyclists are  supposed to be on the road too. But even that is getting better. Out here it is now state law that all new roads or road projects must allow for a bike lane. And in many cities the intersection s have signs that clearly mark where bikes should be. Its getting better slowly.,CyclingMSP,cur78j0,2,t5_2sla8

5525807,0,t3_3qpy4d,I usually dont care if someone is riding fast we all like to go fast.  It is when I silently get passed by someone fully stretched out on the aero bars that i get mad.  Keep your aero bars off the greenway you do not have the same control of the bike as with a less aero position.,CyclingMSP,cwhyzbl,-1,t5_2sla8
6426265,0,t3_43kb11,Count me in. I rode around Lake NokomisHarrietCalhoun this weekend and would highly suggest some fenders. If you stay on the roads it isnt as bad but it seems like the paths get a lot more melting snowpuddles on them. ,CyclingMSP,czk0hfp,3,t5_2sla8
