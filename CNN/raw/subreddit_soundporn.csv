Though of course most assets will be shared with the persistent universe portion. So no its actually really quite important and as his own creative baby as it were it makes sense that hed direct.  The performance capture was an event lasting over  months and he did the directing while also continuing to run to company. Of course he has talented studio directors and producers to help take up the slack but I seriously doubt I slept much those months. ,soundporn,cw5x50f,1,t5_2t95b
