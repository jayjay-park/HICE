6937352,0,t1_d12edzb,Probably. I just want to know if it can be done. Further research tells me that the tokenizer only works in for loops and there is no while loop which is what this really needs.,Batch,d12od4j,1,t5_2sz7y
6964893,0,t3_4b3byl,Since you are probably new to batch I will show you an easy way. For writing echo cash gtgt cash.txt or echo progress gtgt progress.txt. For reading set p cashltcash.txt or set p progressltprogress.txt. What this does is create a text file containing the current number of cash. And since the variable is now stored in the text file you can reclaim it by setting cash as whatever is in the text file. cash amount when last saved I hope this helps. ,Batch,d15t1co,2,t5_2sz7y
7055939,0,t3_4bedjc,There is another way to accomplish this by using call command. First pass entire argument list enclosed into quotation marks to a subroutine. Then work with it as a signle argument like so    call main     gotoeof    main    echo dpn    gotoeof,Batch,d1g5ema,3,t5_2sz7y

8548763,0,t1_d660oi1,I still get the same issue It just keeps on looping without executing the shutdown Edit I managed to get it to work. Instead of just having shutdown I have shutdown.exe s t  D So it worked man thanks for the assistance! D,Batch,d6a6176,1,t5_2sz7y

9970767,0,t3_5ibl7o,If the compressed archive files are stored in the same directory you can possibly take a count of how many current files are in the directory run the nircmd and run another count afterwards to see if the amount of files in the directory have increased before continuing by using a goto command.,Batch,db77urt,1,t5_2sz7y
10003901,0,t1_dbb2gt8,Batch really isnt the best language for this.  Something more high level would be better.  You need to grab the time from an NTP server then again later to compare.  As for protecting memory values you are kinda boned.  If someone is determined enough there is nothing you can do to prevent memory values from being edited.If you want to secure files then you want symmetric crypto based on a password that you create and can enter later to unencrypt. Again the only safe way to store the password is to enter it manually or keep it in the script and encrypt the script manually.  But then you open yourself to memory scraping.,Batch,dbbjc94,1,t5_2sz7y
