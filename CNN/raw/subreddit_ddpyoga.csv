279291,0,t1_cf9mu93,BeginnerIntermediateDont be afraid to jump into Advance though. I was exhausted and sweat buckets after doing Energy the first time. By the end of the  weeks I could do it without breaking a sweat.,ddpyoga,cf9pm0f,4,t5_2udzs
452827,0,t3_1z8d9d,I had to read the book to fully understand this but as has been noted it has to do with optimum fat burning.  The term is anaerobic exercise and it is where the body stops gearing towards burning fat and shifts into building muscle once the heart rate rises too high.  The beauty of it is since weight loss is the goal you get to slow down and take it a little easier at times and get better results. ,ddpyoga,cfrqhcx,1,t5_2udzs
1047164,0,t1_chnayke,Arthur started and did beginner right from the start  I am sure you can do it.  Just jump right in dont stress about it.  Modify when you need to staying on energy every day for weeks will do nothing like mixing it up like the schedule.  Also yes the breaks are important especially at the beginning.  You are building muscle most likely in places you never knew you had muscles.  Your body needs time to heal.Most likely if you follow the program you will be able to do Diamond cutter when it is called for.Also these things are supposed to be hard working out and staying healthy is not something that you can breeze through push yourself with the program and you will know when you can start adding stuff and making it your own  for instance after  months I started adding red hot core to every workout except diamond cutter .  One thing I would recommend is when it says optional on the weekend dont treat it is optional treat it as mandatory.Dont sit and stress yourself out thinking about it and wondering if you are ready jump right in modify or go into safety zone when you need to and you will get there.  It is going to be hard but who cares just commit and accomplish what you want out of it.,ddpyoga,chnbfkf,2,t5_2udzs
1096661,0,t3_26o3ne,Sure you can just do the red hot core every day and concentrate on the work outs that will help build muscle.  ,ddpyoga,chsy0sx,1,t5_2udzs
1499739,0,t3_2bd7hc,DDP is fitness and strech and sells it under the name Yoga its a gimnastics class.What did you expect? I did YRG Yoga for regular guys  years ago and my flexibility and strenght improved. This was my first contact with yoga. Now i do ashtanga yoga. Since i really liked DDP workouts one day I decided to do some videos and man....it was frustrating to realize that there is a lack of union between all the postures DDP does...its fitness...there is nothing comparable to a the sequence flow o motivation that yoga has.If you want to be fit do DDP yoga.If you want to be fit calm and more concious of yourself do yoga.Both aproaches are interesting but except of having the word yoga written on them there are two really diferent things.,ddpyoga,cj49lgj,1,t5_2udzs

3129521,0,t1_comdcpw,Thanks! So considering Im still only in like week  and fat burner gets my heart pumping and Im sweating Im probably easily burning at least ?Also what heart rate monitor do you have? Id ideally want a cheaper one. ,ddpyoga,comdff6,1,t5_2udzs
3275333,0,t1_cp1kbc5,Well Im sure I was more flexible when I was younger than when I started the program but I never was particularly bendy. But Im also sure years of being at a desk didnt help. Theres a workout grid that comes with the DVDs. I started out with the intermediate program since I was in notgreat but notTERRIBLE shape. I did a full round of the intermediate and then a full round of the Advanced.  So I started out working out three days a week now Im repeating the last four weeks of Advanced with whatever variation I like so Im working out five days a week with an optional quick sixth day if I feel like it. One of the days is just Red Hot Core which by itself only takes like  minutes. Just stick with it when you get the DVDs!  It really is kind of fun as workouts go and I find it relatively easy to fit in my schedule especially since theres no real gear to set up other than my yoga mat. ,ddpyoga,cp1m52p,1,t5_2udzs
3492834,0,t1_cppyvr9,Thats awesome! Thanks for the reply. Im addicted to these workouts I do them x a day sometimes and I even bought a HR monitor.,ddpyoga,cpqep7w,1,t5_2udzs
3911685,0,t3_35706k,Yes. Its actually kind of enjoyable to do it twice a day when youve adapted to the harder work outs. I have woken up and done fat burner to start my day and it was great to get the blood pumping. Still came home and did diamond cutterred hot core the same day.,ddpyoga,cr261kb,1,t5_2udzs
3972077,0,t1_cr7mqvi,Im not that guy obviously but I started reliably doing it after about . months of DDP yoga.,ddpyoga,cr91t5w,1,t5_2udzs
4470543,0,t3_3cbdq0,I think stand up is definitely way easier than diamond cutter for me personally.  I dont even remember strength builder off the top of my head might have to make sure thats been on the schedule but so far diamond cutter is the hardest for me.,ddpyoga,csu6phm,1,t5_2udzs

6778456,0,t3_48hgao,The most advanced workouts in DDPY are Psycho and Stevie Richards.   Those are the only two that I need to use unplanned safety zones and catch my breath.   I have to give credit to Christinas workout too.  She had launching pad into crunches which was intense.  Both versions of DC and DBD are a good second place.,ddpyoga,d0kme4e,2,t5_2udzs
7012957,0,t3_4bihj3,I stopped due to a broken ankle. I walked on it undiagnosed for about  months and in that time I did a little but most times I thought exercise something in the back of my head said bad idea. Then I had surgery a month or so after diagnosis  weeks in a cast then PT after... That ended last August. Just never got back into the swing of things.,ddpyoga,d1b9lqb,1,t5_2udzs
7997754,0,t3_4or66t,The weight loss is a nice side effect of DDP Yoga but any real weight loss comes from change in diet. You cant outtrain a shitty diet. ,ddpyoga,d4f0veg,11,t5_2udzs
8175459,0,t1_d4zewy8,You said once a week which is often in the context of wanting to lose weight.,ddpyoga,d4zhd5o,1,t5_2udzs
8271474,0,t3_4sr22z,Yeah.  Day one I had to brush my teeth sitting down after my workout. I even found Pages reddit account and called him an asshole for it. Im only coming up to the end of week three and the difference is ridiculous. Hang in there buddy ,ddpyoga,d5bhrpc,6,t5_2udzs

10899075,0,t3_5vqx35,Do the app and buy the DVDs if you like it enough.  You can try a sample at Teamddpyoga.com but only you can make it happen.  I do this six days a week and though I get sore muscles I no longer have creaky joints or back pain.As far as all your other questions yes.  You can also make up your own routine.  I currently do my own harder version of Advanced routine.,ddpyoga,de45umg,2,t5_2udzs
11060418,0,t3_5xwyhh,There are a few known inconsistencies with exercises skipping  side.Yes you should do everything to both sides.You can either do it while he talks before moving on to the next exercise or pause the video and do it ,ddpyoga,deloiad,3,t5_2udzs
11272133,0,t1_df9o4im,Right everything should be tight but not locked for most of the moving moves was my point. You have to be locked in in plank.. or you are going to collapse. What I meant was like warriors lunge etc the depth of your pose is what locks your lower body automatically. Thats why I said when you are moving.. those poses and pushups the lower body is static. Its your upper body that is moving and where you should be focusing on the resistance. ,ddpyoga,df9ohf3,1,t5_2udzs
11578527,0,t1_dg89pcg,Theres really only two and the hip opener one isnt too bad. The other one is a pretty decent step up from Black Diamond but manageable if you can already handle that. ,ddpyoga,dg8fkr9,1,t5_2udzs
11720201,0,t3_66a7fg,I think the chest straps are more accurate than just wearing the watch.  Isnt the Wahoo what they sell on DDPs site?,ddpyoga,dgoihk9,1,t5_2udzs
