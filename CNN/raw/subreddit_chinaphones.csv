2860373,0,t1_cnsvsqy,Thanks for explaining the company history. I did not realize they were wellknown internationally. Credibility definitely alleviates some of my concerns especially since you mention they have Windows Licenses from MS.The tradeoffs are very positive as you said. I think Ill wait a bit since the new CherryTrail Atoms are supposed to provide about x the GPU performance as the current budget models. Those are already pretty snappy as is. So the new ones may even have lowmoderate gaming potential. Thanks again for sharing I really appreciate the opportunity to learn about these options!,chinaphones,cnt84ws,1,t5_2yw0t
4359505,0,t3_3ay6e0,Honestly if youre looking for a phone to use in the US the Sony Xperia Z Compact is among the best lt screen phones.I have a Huawei P Lite and its bigger than I want it to be and I dont really like the MyUI or whatever they call their operating system. Also the fact that they dont have buttons at the bottom of the phone means you lose a fair amount of screen real estate to having soft buttons at the bottom of your screen. This ultimately means you end up with a similar amount of screen real estate as a smaller phone like the ZC and it seems to be the case with a lot of Chinese phones.,chinaphones,csh1snb,1,t5_2yw0t

4542506,0,t1_ct35glv,I paid with Paypal from my Paypal balance. Had to sign for the phone as well so I doubt I can charge back.I DID get a reply today finally and they did offer to upgrade to free DHL shipping but wont offer the  credit in that case. As for the repair time the support person said theyll ask their expert and get back to me on it as soon as they can.Im worried that they cant fix the phone at all since the spare parts may not be available. That said the phone is a copy of an Ulephone model Im actually using an Ulephone smart case on my own Nexodus Plus and the smart case fits and works perfectly.Sadly they didnt tell me anything about the repairing process apart from that theyre repairing it urgently. I was given no details whatsoever.EDIT I remembered that a certain Ulefone seems to have the same screenIn fact the  phones are identical apart from the logos on the back.,chinaphones,ct37l21,1,t5_2yw0t

Then I got a better job and thought I could spend some more money once but the Sony Z Compact was a complete disappointment to me To be honest however the SD  has a big part of that. It is probably the worst highend flagship SoC that was ever released . Sure there will be compromises but there are always compromises. Ive also thought about the iPhone SE for some time but I just still dont like that company if only by the fact that they are actually selling a   phone with a storage of  GB in . ,chinaphones,d4hq1xt,1,t5_2yw0t

Top One from Aliexpress doesnt put Vendor ROMs in I was worried about the same thing found out on this very forum lol. I believe that you can actually contact them too but Im not  sure. it is not Gorilla Glass. It is scratch resistant its about equal to Gorilla Glass but the exact glass comes from multiple different sources. youll probably get HSPA faster than G a bit slower than G. Some people call it .G.Its definitely fast enough when web browsing it is noticably slightly slower when streaming video itll buffer once or twice.,chinaphones,d6khmgo,1,t5_2yw0t

9140792,0,t3_55exgg,I got mine  months ago.Its very thin and lightweight for  compared to my old Nexus  not that much bigger in size. Just a few grams heavier cant notice a difference by hand. Build quality is  nothing rattles or looks off.Camera is not that great video is unusable because of background noise  GPS is sometimes off but works for me with google maps.Would not recommend for hiking etc. where you need accurate position. Sound volume for calling could be a bit higher. SIM Tray is fragile  I had card issues until I took it out and back in again now its fine. But it fell off my bed and made a dent near the tray so maybe this is the cause.Everything else on this phone is still fantastic for the cheap price. Standard ROM was fine too.I would not recommend it though because of the risk to fail like any other cheap chinaphone. Not worth it and there still are a lot of complaints online. If you keep that in mind its a nice phone.,chinaphones,d8antb0,3,t5_2yw0t
