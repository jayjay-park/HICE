3472451,0,t3_300yve,Hi and welcome to Stamford! Youre right the city is fairly safe but there are some sketchy neighborhoods. Id mainly try to avoid most of the West Side especially streeta off ofonaround Connecticut Ave and W Main. However keep in mind that thats still a pretty arbitrary zone. Always be sure to visit the neighborhood the apartment is in before you sign the lease.,StamfordCT,cpo323r,3,t5_2x33a
6084172,0,t1_cygzfut,The Majestic is the larger one where youll get most of your big releases. Thats where Star Wars is playing and in the past theyve had the Avengers movies and stuff like Avatar. The Landmark is part of the mall and is pretty nice for what its worth. Majestic is slightly bigger but at the Landmark youll find some smaller releases as well as a few big ones like Inglorious Basterds sprinkled in for variety. Its nice and entirely on the second floor of the mall. Avon Theater is also downtown but hosts exclusively indie movies and limited releases. Its very nice Ive taken a few girls there on dates. They also do cool stuff like hosting local film festivals. Im pretty sure its the oldest theater in Stamford. Finally you have the State Theater in Springdale. Its tiny and historic they have only two screens so they only play two movies at one time. Usually its a big release like Star Wars or Mad Max. The big draw here is that its cheap tickets are like  on weekdays. Hope this helps!,StamfordCT,cyh464b,1,t5_2x33a
6407014,0,t3_43cyhv,The first  seconds were really good but then it just becomes a list of changes that have happened recently and overtly political. I live in the heart of downtown but still dont really know much about the area so I was enjoying the history stuff.,StamfordCT,czhwuzr,3,t5_2x33a

I met Vince McMahon at cvs on Newfield Ave. he was a lot bigger in person like physique was. And he drove a black on black tinted Bentley continental. ,StamfordCT,d0karp4,1,t5_2x33a
