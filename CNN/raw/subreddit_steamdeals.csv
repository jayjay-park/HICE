219721,0,t3_1wmsjn,EDIT  off for Conviction. Missed that somehow.Pandora Tomorrow never made it to Steam apparently the graphics dont work on newer machines wasnt made by the same folks as the first and third but the first and Chaos Theory are worth more than the listed . apiece and Double Agent isnt bad at that price either.    But Double Agent is where the series jumped the shark storywise and Conviction is where it went off the deep end gameplay wise so buyer beware for that one even at  bucks.      dollars for Blacklist sounds like a good deal for a newish game but Conviction left a bad taste in my mouth.

Overall I think you can get one play through with just the base game and DLCs are great if you want to play through again with different options. Im on my rd playthrough with the vanilla game and am still enjoying it. Like others said its a steep learning curve id suggest you check the wiki and it has some advise for your first playthrough. My first successfulfun playthrough was as a duke in Ireland and I ended up as king of all the UK and northern France.
