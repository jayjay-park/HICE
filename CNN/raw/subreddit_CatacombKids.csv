3587361,0,t1_cq12vaf,Well that is a write up and a  half O   Awesome run!Really interesting to me that your previous best one got crushed in the floor th tank fight mine did as well. Makes me wonder if there is a difficulty change at that point because the jump seemed significantly faster and my kid should have been able to kill Spidy of easily.Also you should give of escape more credit. Since the patch you actually dodge attacks by teleporting negating their damage which is extremely useful.  Same with portal. Its more than a glorified teleport with less charges. You can use it to amplify overloaded spells scout out rooms without using up charges with trickery move gas around kill enemies in dozens of ways move bodies out of reaper rooms...I usually never take temporal step or vampyrism on Poet but I guess at some point it doesnt matter stats wise. Both of my serious poet runs died at the Tank at floor ten though mostly because I wanted to test a spell only kill on it.Anyway kinda surprised that you only had two ranged offensive spells. Did you use temporal step or normal attacks vs fire Grumbuls?Really impressed that the only limb you got cut of in the entire thing was your shield arm and even that only once. And I should try to take portal as starting spell the one square size is neat.,CatacombKids,cq16qvf,2,t5_2yv6r
3973149,0,t3_35vz9n,Instead of having to post a new Daily Run thread everyday would you guys like me to make a Weekly Daily Run thread every week until Leaderboards come out? Im thinking that every day of the particular week could have its own comment thread. It will somewhat keep the subreddit clutterfree plus I can make it a sticky post so its always at the top. ,CatacombKids,cr967jh,2,t5_2yv6r

4741013,0,t3_3fusr7,My advice would be stop trying to fight them! Go around them with teleport or blink trick them into falling on spikes use portal to move them out of your way crush them with a boulder lure them into fighting a skeleton set off a gas trap to explode them set them on fire and run away till they die ice them and kill them while theyre frozen poison them and run away until their health is really low sneak past them with an invisibility potion etc.The way I see it the game isnt really about combat its about problemsolving and combat is a last resort. Charging in is going to get you killed especially on floor one. Even if you watch one of the really good players when theyre streaming youll see that fighting grumbuls on the early floors is a licence to get murdered. On floor one I never straightup fight a grumbul unless I have absolutely no choice and I still die a lot.,CatacombKids,cts5dmu,2,t5_2yv6r

6524984,0,t1_czu74ou,Stand over an uncooked morsel spiced too if you want a spiced soup with a empty bottle in your hand and hold the contextual button to bottle it. Then it should say Spicy Byat in a Bottle or whatever. Then jump into water with the bottle and it should say Spicy Byat in a Bottle of Water. Drop that over a heat source and wait a little. Its a bit buggy at the moment sometimes it never stops being hot soup for me which damages you when you drink it. Anyway in this example the finished product should be Spicy Byat Soup.,CatacombKids,czu8hdz,2,t5_2yv6r

10272989,0,t3_5n1sop,I remember the game having a pretty steep learning curve for me as well even after a couple dozen hours into the game. The game is pretty tricky and even after countless hours of playing I still occasionally see myself dying on the first several floors if Im not careful. I dont exactly remember when everything started to click for me but Im sure youll reach that point soon.  A couple of things I can address from your screenshots I wouldnt say  is bullshit but I guess I can call it unlucky. In general I avoid taking teleport pads because I dont know where theyll take me and what dangers await me when I get there. If this was an unintentional teleport make sure to keep your eye out for the trigger pads. They are discreet but should be visible when you get near them especially with a higher INT stat.   shows a recent bug that has already been pointed out to the developer Tyriq so it will probably be fixed in an upcoming update.   also looks like a bug but Im not entirely sure if Tyriq knows about it. If he doesnt see it here uFourbitFriday you can submit it on the Steam discussions page in the BugsIssues section  In general for map traversing most if not all areas should be reachable in one way or another but unfortunately there are instances where the map generator didnt correctly place objectives or makes certain areas unreachable and should also be reported to the Steam discussions page. However there are several ways to try and overcome these obstacles. Many objects like greenpink goos and mushrooms can be used to reach higher areas. Eating a byat meal increases your jump height for a while. Certain boons and spells can also increase your maneuverability. Dangers like spikes and lava can also be dealt with using things like corpses and bottles of potionswater. You can also reenter the entrance door once per floor in order to remake the map.   I think  is impossible to make with a jump but not unreachable.    definitely impossible to make with a jump but also not unreachable.     is impossible to make with a jump and probably unreachable without the use of spellsboon.      is impossible to make with a jump and unreachable without spellsboon.    should be reachable if you crawl onto the right ledge and make a short hop onto the platform below. To make it  safe throw down a bottle of water or potion into the lava and wait for it to harden.     is can be done using ledge jumping.,CatacombKids,dc8hzmb,2,t5_2yv6r
