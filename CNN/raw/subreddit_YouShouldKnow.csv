733090,0,t1_cgnaonh,sorry for coming off strongly i copypasted my rants a few times so its not like I think youre the devil lol.I guess its frustrating because generally if someone says theyre the victim of a crime people are inclined to believe them.  If someone is accused of robbery theft arson murder whatever people tend to think that the accused is guilty thats not necessarily good but thats beside the point for now.  The thing is that the one exception seems to be when someone is accused of sexual assault.  People especially on Reddit seem to think its way more important to be neutral on these crimes than all others and many on here even automatically take the side of the alleged perpetrator. And for victims of rape and other sexual crimes being doubted is especially traumatic.  I dont know entirely why this is but I do know that sexual assault really fuck up a person.  They often think they did something to deserve it or they completely shut down at any physical contact with even a loved one or they start sleeping around because theyve been emotionallymentally fucked.  And so often the victims are automatically viewed with skepticism and doubt and often even reviled not that you were doing that and this not only makes other victims less likely to come out it also makes the victim who was doubted blame herself even more.Its not really rational but in my experience people who have been rapedmolestedsexually assaulted are in an understandably fragile mentalemotional state because of it so even simply not taking them at their word fucks them up.  Obviously if I told someone who was robbed that I didnt necessarily believe them they would be frustrated and pissed off but they most likely wouldnt be affected in the same way.And so I guess its frustrating because in a case like this I dont really see any upside to not taking a poster at her word.  If she accused someone by name of raping her it would obviously be more difficult because the alleged attacker would be a victim if the story was fake.  But since she didnt name specifics theres no harm in taking her at her word.  EDIT sorry for being really wordy,YouShouldKnow,cgnlu4u,2,t5_2r94o

Nor do I know how many people accidentally affiliate with the Independent Party theres no way to track that kind of data. This generally in person at least when we can warn them leads to them having to refill out a new card. In states that dont happen to have an Independent Party or an Independence Party or something similar it can be at the discretion of the Registrar to determine this defaults to unaffiliated. Im merely using my own anecdotal evidence that a lot of people make this mistake and I am passing it on. Most people seem grateful. As I said before they are specially not wanting to affiliate themselves with an official party so they are happy to be informed about the potential mistake.

A substances LD is not a guaranteed lethal dosage rather it states that statistically  of a population will die when administered that dosage.Thirdly alcohol metabolizes into acetaldehyde which is toxic and then into acetate. The longer the acetaldehyde remains in your system the more likely you are to have bad hangovers get sick or otherwise suffer from the effects of alcohol.     Depending on your genetics and a few other contributing factors your body may either slowly metabolize alcohol into acetaldehyde or rapidly metabolize acetaldehyde into acetate both processes which keep the body from experiencing too much toxicity from drinking.TLDR Your mileage may vary.,YouShouldKnow,cidyznb,3,t5_2r94o

John This is not true since i Josephus details Jews being stoned by other Jews. ii Archeologists have uncovered surviving inscription on the temple saying to the effect that everyone who goes past this point will be stoned. iii Jesus is threatened with stoning in several other places in the Bible. Other gospels are reticent on why did the Romans have to execute Jesus but John is clear and clearly wrong.gt  There is also no evidence that crucifixion only took place with traitors of Rome or that Pilate was a tyrant as next to nothing is known about him in any contemporary writings at the time.Josehpus and Philo of Alexandria both write about Pilates brutality and corruption at some length.

That is to say if you have something in your foot even causing pressure like at the pressure points it will ulcerate.  Throw in the poor vascular supply and it doesnt heal.   Diabetes CAN cause many horrible complications.  Diabetes should absolutely not and in no way be viewed as a fatal disease.  Thats a truly terrible point of view to take in my opinion.

Does it increase your risk for other diseases that are fatal?  Yes.

1854806,0,t1_ckck2hr,Only something that replaces or modifies Microsofts own HID keyboard driver could possibly prevent software keyloggers and because of that they could also actually be a keylogger. It has to do with the level of access provided to the computer hardware  the ultimate level of hardware access is in your BIOS or UEFI and the firmware in the various controller chips. Historically since NT . the software layer directly underneath firmware and bios has been NTs Hardware Abstraction Layer HAL for short and underneath that the drivers. These drivers are a big deal because they have very special system access. If Im correct drivers have access to listen directly to whatever data enters into hardware buffers which is where the control codes sent from your keyboard enter your motherboard. After reading that USB buffer the driver will interpret what all that means  the HID driver is there for mouse and keyboard basically and does only that. Then the driver will output something to the Windows kernel  telling it that the keyboard said to produce some key strokes.The kernel will then wire up those key strokes to the active computer window that has the cursor inside it or the active control. Besides the active window other programs have access to the same key stroke information. These programs install a hook which is like a subscription to the information put out by the kernel  the kernel knows that it has to send out information about key strokes and programs subscribed to this information receive it.Theres a nice example of this which is AutoHotkey. It makes use of these hooks by allowing you to configure shortcuts and AutoHotkey then puts out something else instead  it follows a series of programmed instructions to do something useful.A good virus scanner is aware of what hooks are placed and Im sure theres an easy way to check into those hooks yourself. I use a firewall that tells me these things but it has a builtin white list of what software it thinks is OK and what isnt  in that case it tells me if the software should have access to register itself. Comodo Firewall is very good but high maintenance you need to tell what to do every time you install something new.then there are rootkits that wedge themselves somewhere inside of the Windows kernel Im not sure how but theres a lot of information on that too.,YouShouldKnow,ckcp6o2,7,t5_2r94o

At work I pretend I have vision problems so people dont think thats why I read the clock so slowly. I spell badly but I know adults that spell worse than me. Spell check is my friend.

2480900,0,t1_cmicwy4,I suppose I should have worded my question better. The yamanaka factors are what I was thinking of when I was asking the original question my mistake for not wording the question better. The specific answer I was trying to see if youd spot are one of the  among others Yamanaka factors involved in induced pluripotent stem cells. Namely Oct Sox Nanog and Myc. I was hoping youd have caught Myc out specifically because its one of the few  that is a protooncogene and particularly problematic because  Usage of the myc family of genes in induction of iPS cells is troubling for the eventuality of iPS cells as clinical therapies as  of mice transplanted with cmycinduced iPS cells developed lethal teratomas. Nmyc and Lmyc have been identified to induce instead of cmyc with similar efficiency.Again sorry for not wording the question better because Im tempted to nitpick but I figured it was better to make sure I was  asking you the question in a better way. Ive noticed I tend to do that frequently so I checked my notes from class before asking you a third time P. For whatever reason the ERKWNT MAP reference bugs me because they are part of regular cell processes for mitosis  they were identified by different lab research but can be hijacked easily by viruses because they arent genes so to speak. They are pathways that can be modified and rerouted. Like the E affecting both E and E step you were explaining on the last reply. The reason it bugs is because the name itself is indicative of pathways not genes not that genes arent involved in the process.

Some fakes dont bend as well as real fakes. When Im bouncing how closely I check IDs is tied directly to my mood. The happier I am the less closely I check IDs.

2763279,0,t1_cni5rey,But that goes back to the point I made originally we have a very supply heavy economy. Investment is quick easy and plentiful because there is a LOT of money in savings and investments by the upper classes.Pretty much all the low hanging fruit has been plucked and new ones are snapped up pretty quickly.  There is not a dearth of investment that stops growth in the economy. But there IS a dearth of Demand which barring a few specific examples like technology RampD is not increased by investment.In other words yes the overall economy can act as a zerosum in many ways.  Infinite growth is not possible without increasing wages in excess of inflation so that Demand increases and the bottleneck has been on the Demand side pretty firmly for awhile now.,YouShouldKnow,cni6a4e,8,t5_2r94o
2766706,0,t1_cniehd8,These are of course generalizations.The magic numbers I keep in my head are  and .The  is for  percent.  In the old days before our interest rates were basically pegged below   percent was where I considered the switch between investment and savings to be.  If banks would raise interest rates to  or higher large investors would have little reason to take risks on investments put money in a bank and earn ?!  Yes Please!  But dropping below  would push money into investments where it would pay back better than the measly  you could get in the bank does this tell you anything about our current economy where they are afraid to raise rates at all?  It kinda frightens me.  Mind you this number is a personal number that I just use for comparisons. is a good standard long term period to pay for a large loan.  Something like a home or a capital loan to buy property for a business.  But the main point is that in general  years is a reasonable time period for our largest expenses to be paid off.  This is good to keep in mind because it puts things into perspective when peoplebusinesses make large investments the period before they are paid for is usually measured in decades.So when you say why dont they just use that tax refund to buy new more efficient equipment and very quickly start making more money I think Well if they could pay that kind of stuff off in less than a couple years they would probably have invested in it already.  Banks that make  year loans are probably going to fund a loan that does this without needing the extra tax revenue.If its a major capital expense that would require a  year investment its likely that whatever tax breaks we are talking about wont come close to paying for them even adding up a couple years worth of savings.Of course this isnt true for every business.  There are businesses that are expanding even in bad times.  But they are already expanding so they dont really need the tax break to expand!  Sure it might be helpful but again unless its needed why do we want to give it?Then there are the companies in a stagnant economy that are on the cusp.  Man if we only had  more this year I could take K of my own and buy a second printing press which would allow us to print more and I have the demand for it.  These are the companies we want to help.  But in a stagnant economy there arent a lot of them.And then theres most of whats out there... companies not seeing any increase in demand whose equipment costs a lot to invest in.  Those tax breaks arent going to fund those investments they arent going to expand unless they see demand which  is not there so that tax break goes right into profit not investment.,YouShouldKnow,cnikb7x,2,t5_2r94o

The act also protects employees who engage in a concerted activity.I believe discussing unequal salaries would fall under opposing wrongful discrimination andor concerted activity which is protected under this act and termination under this pretense would be grounds for legal action.Edit several of the deleted comments below are mine which were purely conjecture and quickly disputed by several people I deleted them because they were shown to be false and so they wouldnt keep getting the same replies over and over and over again and continue to be downvoted.

If percocet s are supposed to have  mg of hydrocodone with a  mg leeway on either end the name brand will tend to have mg while the generic will have mg. This can be why people will swear by brands.

3563039,0,t3_31383w,I may be late the the thread but heres what Ive noticedThe evidence suggests that students who learn the old way perform better on international tests. Here in Canada we have something like Common Core Lite for math standards in the four Western provinces. Manitoba actually dropped out of the Western Canadian Protocol after university professors begged the government to do so. The issue was that students arrived at university without the basics.I fully understand the issue of students who dont have number sense managing to make it through because they memorised formulas. The problem is with the new way those students dont ever gain number sense they just fail to get by and hate math a whole lot earlier. There are also many students who thrive because they have number sense but are bad at memorising and so do better under the new system. My biggest complaint is not about who wins and who loses in the new system its about how poorly researched any of it is before it becomes policy for the next  years. The few studies that I managed to find prior to its implementation were done on a handful of private schools and were a couple of months in duration. If you tried that in any other profession youd become a laughing stock yet here we are as professional educators completely changing practice based on no credible research whatsoever. ,YouShouldKnow,cpyev81,4,t5_2r94o

I dont care about your leadership skills Im hiring you as an entrylevel employee or an intern.Is college supposed to be about doing only the things related to your field? Isnt it better knowing that a candidate is a somewhat multidimensional person who can function in a range of environments? I guess itll depend on the role youre hiring for but bright people tend not to limit themselves to experiences directly related to the major theyre pursuing in my experience. Youve got your entire career to get better at your field but college is the best time to actually explore some curiosities and develop some qualitiesskills that are universally applicable. Arent successful people typically curious and hungry to expand their knowledgeexperiences outside of just a narrow interest? Maybe I dont have an accurate view on this. And why are leadership skills worthless? I understand an entrylevel worker or intern wont be managing anyone but the kind of people who have strong leadership skills are also the kind of people who take initiative and are able to do things without being given specific instructions right?. Theyre also most likely to make good longterm employees right?. ,YouShouldKnow,cqot679,2,t5_2r94o
3800270,0,t3_2owjjv,Youre correct.  When you book a round trip airline ticket you are booking   fares.  This means that you could have  sets of fare rules.  In general when there are two sets of fare rules on one ticket airlines follow the most restrictive set of fare rules.  Furthermore noshows make it very difficult for the airlines to allocate their resources so they almost universally build the most stringent penalties into the fair rules for noshows.  One thing you should also know and most travelers arent smart enough to know this but if you noshow on your outbound ticket the airline cancels without refund all subsequent flights.

3901594,0,t3_352bne,Given the huge academic boom theres plenty of jobs in academia if you compare to a few decades ago. The problem is that you can practically teach and research until you die or go senile so normal turnover is slow compared to many other professions. Actual problem is that grant funding from NIH is extremely low compared to  decades ago and in the sciences at most universities youre expected to have won X of your salary in grants. If you already have  or more RO grants its super easy to find a job because youre nearly paying your salary already. Otherwise to make up for not having enough grants youre subject to the university demands on teaching and administration and theres only so many of those to go around at a single university. With more and more PhDs getting pumped out  research assistants adjunct professors and industry is where most PhDs will end up. Supply of academics especially in bio are very high and grant funding is low getting to run your own lab is a dream that is difficult to achieve for this reason.  of PhDs  years is not surprising to me.

It is a physical impossibility that the tread will last forever. Friction and the laws of physics prevent this. If you hike  miles in them they have lived out their lifetime. Or if you buy trail running shoes for example and wear them on pavement  you significantly reduce the lifetime of the shoe because they were designed to give traction on dirt and rocks softer sole not pavement all day every day. These trail running shoes have lived their lifetime. Now if you feel like your hiking boots should have lasted  miles rather than  miles thats the subjective part thats up to you. Bring them back they didnt live up to the lifetime of the product you expected when you bought them. No problem with that. But to expect them to last  years of vigorous use is a little mislead. Unless you bought it thinking this one product this specific pair of shoes you bought would last you the rest of your life then by all means bring it back. You are dissatisfied and they have a lifetime satisfaction guarantee. What they are not selling is free replacement for life. Do you see the difference?,YouShouldKnow,cr8srn2,4,t5_2r94o

4393363,0,t1_cskp29r,What uSilverlight is totally correct for titanium and other metals but there are a few things other than the appearance of a Tungsten Carbide ring to bear in mind. It is a little different than most metals used for jewellery.Tungsten Carbide is made from a powder of Tungsten Carbide and often other stuff cemented together with a binder which is then cast using high heat and pressure. Other than polishing it theres not a lot else you can do to the ring once its cast.The most common cement for Tungsten Carbide overall is Cobalt which is great for many applications because its cheap and easy to get right. Youd probably find this in most Tungsten Carbide tipped drills for example.However Cobalt as a cement is not very good for jewellery. It commonly causes skin irritation and compared to better cements makes the material more prone to discolouration its more reactive and scratching.The best binder is a mixture of Nickel Chromium and Molybdenum as this gives the best resistance and least reaction to the majority of things So if youre going to get a Tungsten Carbide ring make sure its Cobalt free and from a reputable source that you can trust this information from.This doesnt mean to say you cant still get a really good Cobalt free Tungsten Carbide ring for th the price of a high street jewellery store. You absolutely can! Im just saying that the Cobalt thing is something to watch out for.I can confirm that Tungsten Carbide is really good for rings too. Ive been wearing my Tungsten Carbide wedding ring for  years. Ive never taken it off.

Did you just do a general search about last nights event and randomly end up on James Spanns blog or were you already familiar with him as  a local weather man? Just curious. I loved watching the weather as a small child and James Spann was the only meteorologist my parents would listen to. We get some pretty bad weather in Alabama and for many many years was ALWAYS on live when things were expected to get bad our way. Somehow seeing him on the TV during the worst of storms ended up being a comfort to me and encouraging my love for all things weather related. Hes a great guy. I sent him a message after I got my degree in education and landed my first teaching job. I asked him if he would be able to come speak to my fifth graders during our unit on meteorologyand he kept his promise even though it was all the way at the end of the school year. Sorry for the essay...I got carried away The moment presented itself to me and I feel like good people deserve to be recognized   for their good deeds when we are given the platform to do so! ,YouShouldKnow,csnavpm,1,t5_2r94o

4845594,0,t1_cu54jjm,Actually sushi literally means sour tasting and has existed since the th century well before vinegar began to be used. Originally it was just fermented rice which was used to make a shell around fish in order to preserve it through the fermentation process so it was this fermentation that gave it its sour taste. In this traditional method the rice was discarded and the fish eaten. It wasnt until the Muromachi period around  years later that rice wine vinegar was used and it eventually gave way to the modern version of sushi which is no longer fermented but still has the vinegar for flavor. Modern usage of the word sushi refers to the vinegared rice itself and the rest of the ingredients are more like toppings. This is also why sashimi which is just sliced pieces of raw fish is not sushi  it has no rice vinegared or otherwise.,YouShouldKnow,cu5bnid,3,t5_2r94o

Called  again same woman. She then finally transferred me to Chicago dispatch who after hearing the intersection I was now passing told her that was her jurisdiction. After they argued for a second she finally took some info from me including the description of the car and its license plate said she would send someone. By that time we had reached the suspects house and he had gone down an alleyway. I let them know where they had gone and waited by the street to see if anyone would show up.

6011003,0,t1_cy7jcru,Depends on what you are doing really.First off lets for the sake of argument that linuxUbuntu. It isnt but Ill explain that later.Installation is always easier than a windows OS. Why? Vast majority of linux installs detect the hardware your computer has. With windows you need to visit vendor websites and look for proper drivers. For example you install windows and it doesnt detect either wifi or ethernet. Getting drivers installed in this case is always a good time if you dont have the install media or drivers on a thumb drive beforehand.Usability depends on what you use a computer for. Web use and writing documents has software the OS installer considers default. With windows you need IEor whatever it is in win to get another browser and an office suite. With ubuntu firefox and an office suite are installed default.Linux is a kernel I just wanted my reply to be easy for nonlinux users to relate to. Ubuntu is a distribution that uses the linux kernel. Ubuntu is I guess a flavour of what a desktop linuxdriven OS is.Hope this answer helps.EDIT To clarify is I rarely encounter a driverfree postinstall experience with Windows. Older machines tend to be better detected than new. I never installed win from scratch before. Recently its win.,YouShouldKnow,cy7kmco,8,t5_2r94o

When I see hey guys your mental health is just one easy fix away! as a clickbait title I see red. Because its people like you who offer a convenient problem to blame and an easy solution who hurt my brother the most. Sure you said go to the doctor and get checked out inside your post but for people like my brother theyre not going to get that far.

6243975,0,t3_4138e7,I really dont get the point of this post. First of all whether or not you describe yourself with a disease term shouldnt really matter in general. If youre going to get offended or annoyed by people misusing words in their exact denotative fashion I would expect retardmentally retarded to be the primary example. To which there is some validity but I still personally think you can express yourself however you like especially if you are getting your point across effectively. Second I really dont understand why you think OCPD is more accurate because I believe its less accurate in describing what people are doing when they refer to their behavior in a comparative way to OCD. With your example someone is getting annoyed with a picture frame not being parallel to the floor probably. There is an obsession things need to be organized in this or that way and a compulsion I will take this or that action to alleviate my obsession. OCPD on the other hand tends to revolve more around the strictness of a lifestyle. This means scheduling is so important that alternative means can never justify the ends. This means not trusting other people to do things for you because they could straight up fuck up your whole day by being slightly late or doing something slightly out of the ordinary. Additionally people with OCPD tend not to see the problems they have as problems but more  of guidelines that a person needs to religiously keep in line with to live correctly.So correcting a slightly crocked picture frame at least in the example of people misusing OCD isnt the act of religiously keeping to a specific organization in order to function. Its just something thats bothering a person and they want to act have a compulsion to relieve that irritation. I do understand where you are coming from in terms of the perfection angle but thats not really the main component I was taught to focus on when learning OCPD in terms of differentiating from OCD.,YouShouldKnow,cyzdele,7,t5_2r94o

6723689,0,t1_d0eltb4,Sure but the implications are huge. DNA can be really damning evidence in crimes you may not have even committed or minor ones you may not have known you committed. DNA evidence that at one time was said to be solid is frequently thrown out and innocent people exonerated from prison. There is very little oversight of forensic science in most of the country and entire types of evidence previously used to convict people have been found to be complete bunk at providing accurate DNA matcheshair analysis for example.Try imagining a scenario where guilt by association coupled with someone who genuinely wants to help law enforcement adds up to enough evidence to turn it into another ugly case of an innocent person in prison.I think the best way to look at this is an analogy to the importance of the th amendment. With the sheer number of laws in the federal code alonenot including your state and even countylocal ordinances youre looking at over  criminal laws and anywhere from  regulations that can be enforced criminally. In fact the code has become so big that the Congressional Research Service and the American Bar Association simply do not have enough staff to adequately categorize every law we have on the books. There is simply no way a person can know whether they are breaking the law or not on a frequent basis. Buying certain lobsters that are imported can be a federal offense for example and the smallest offenses can be and are frequently used to pick people up if the police have even a fleeting suspicion youre guilty of something. I dont think adding ways of collecting DNA evidence without filling the burden of proof a warrant requires does any favors to the system when you look at all of this.,YouShouldKnow,d0esdde,2,t5_2r94o

6875472,0,t3_40zh69,I dont like bitdefender free AT ALL because it simply takes files it deems dangerous and puts them in quarantine with no user confirmation  this can be VERY bad if your both an advanced user who knows whats dangerous and not and also someone who intentionally downloads malicious code like trainers no cd hacks cracked games  basically code which COULD be virus like but is in fact just memory manipulation that works in a similar wayI also would like to point out another HUGE NEGATIVE OF AVAST.Nobody mentions this one  but it also takes action WITHOUT user consent. basically if you write code you may run into it yourself. simple code that opens a window in x ASM many C programs and others simply will never run and get stuck in memory for some reason if you dont pay to have your software certified.the real problem isnt that it stops the code from running  its that it DOESNT TELL YOU. there is no pop up. no nothing. it just wont work like your code is broken. shut down avast open the task manager and kill any remaning remnants of your program and run it again  AND IT WORKSso avast actually disables perfectly fine code from running that isnt malicious sometimes. IM not sure what does it but  of the simple programs I wrote from hello world to a sieve of eratosthenes for project euler. All of it was affected.I mean avira currently detects a simple blank window I wrote in x ASM in MASM. but it gives me the OPTION to choose what to do with it.Im all for seeking a replacement for avira. but right now I dont see anything else I could possibly use.My requirements are  low false positives ALWAYS ASK FOR USER CONSENT ON EVERYTHING.Basically I dont want anything getting in the way of how I run my system  I pirate things. deal with it. if there is no virus in the stuff dont tell me there is and erase it without giving me the chance to say no.and worse yet dont do something similar to that and then not tell me at all like avastbelieve me guys theres a lot more controversial stuff happening in avast that people DONT talk about and its worse than the email thing.but I just cant like bitdefender. I wanted to. I wanted to so bad. but I tried it and it just started detecting false positives all over the place like a paranoid freak and not only that it didnt let me STOP it from taking action automatically.bitdefender just does stuff. its great if you dont know what your doing never download sketchy stuff etc. but if you do its just not usable. half your collection of nonvirus data will just be smashed into oblivion quicker than you can say STOP!!!!if only it gave you the option with every detection what to do it would be excellent.it IS excellent if you just want to trust it all the time.but there is a lot of code out there that heuristics detects as a virus that truly isnt but just manipulates memory in similar hackish ways basically any cracked game  think about it breaking the DRM sort of is a virus kind of but one that may be beneficial to some of usis there any way to stop this behavior of bitdefender to make it run almost as if it were avira or AVG  where I could tell it to take NO ACTIONS until I confirmed those actions and told it whether or not I wanted to leave the file delete the file or quarantine it.my problem with it solely was that it acted without my consent. that it just jumped ahead and did whatever it thought needed to happen without asking me first. at best id get a warning. thats not enough.,YouShouldKnow,d0vnchh,0,t5_2r94o

Dont even get me started on the shoe thing though.  I literally had  or  pairs of shoes near our front door and about  or  pairs in my room.  The fire department threw all of our shoes out the front door to get up the stairs they were in a shoe rack.

9950711,1,t1_db4hem9,There should definitely be more conversation and scientific discussion and less condesention going on with climate science.Lots of smart minds have built amazing models and shown warming trends.  However there are some very real and very serious concerns about the underlying temp data being altered by researchers.Specifically the UK measuring stations going back decades processing the temp data and throwing away the original measurements.  There were also climategate emails where a couple of the scientists were caught discussing which temp data to raise to match the models.Understandably this doesnt get much exposure because the big business and grant implications that hang on global warming carbon offsets and the lot.Here are a couple of articles to get you started down the rabbit trail...Declaring climate change as a done deal just isnt responsible.  The parties involved need to defend their actions and unfortunately well never have accurate historical data any more.

If all of the cases that went to the ER inappropriately went to urgent care instead they would be incredibly overwhelmed.

It didnt hurt it wasnt an emergency but because it wouldnt cost them anything they decided to go to the ER for it anyway I live in Sweden. There were clear signs outside the entrance telling people to seek help elsewhere if it wasnt an emergency but they chose to ignore it. They were given lowest priority and decided to give up and go home after waiting some hours I dont know how many. The ER is very centrally located in the capital so I ended up waiting  hours to see a doctor for pain on the right side of my tummy. Not an experience I want to repeat but I called the nurse hotline beforehand and she adviced me to go to the ER. ,YouShouldKnow,dbo9y36,7,t5_2r94o

10811520,0,t1_ddtltsd,Yeah without a large down payment its pretty much impossible to not end up upside down early on if you buy a new car. From a strict finance perspective money down on a car loan is usually not a great place to tie up your cash so its a bit of a lose lose unless you get GAP insurance. I personally think this is the most compelling reason to get a slightly used car but Im not judging anyone who wants a new one. IMO most people who buy brand new are better off leasing for this exact reason but theres a bit of a stigma against it because people see leasing as a way to live beyond your means.,YouShouldKnow,ddv4rdz,2,t5_2r94o
