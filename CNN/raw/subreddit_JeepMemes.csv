474884,0,t1_cfu1uts,As a former Jeep employee Im entitled to my fucking high horse thank you very much.Yes there have been many technological advancements over the years that have brought a lot to the Jeep brand most notably the Rubicon with factory lockers and low gears.  However in that same vein has been a number of lackluster attempts by Chrysler to profit off the Jeep brand at the expense of Jeeps uniqueness i.e. Compass and Patriot both being rebadged Calibers the Liberty being a rebadged Nitro the devolution of the Grand Cherokee from a utility x into a luxury pavement pounder the loss of the Jeep truck line in order to preserve struggling Dodge truck sales forfeiting the .L in favor of a minivan motor the list goes on. Sorry to say but the long list of shortcomings over the last  years far exceeds any advancements that Chrysler made while at the helm.  I wont even touch Fiats recent contributions.Anyway Im glad youre ablewilling to rip all the extra sensors out of a JK.  At that point might as well rip out the engine and trans too and swap in something more powerful.  However while youre at it ask yourself why on gods green earth youre having to undo all the extra shit that is shoved in a Jeep these days?Its not simply Oh I like old Jeeps and new ones are shit.  It comes down to what the Jeep brand was compared to what it has become and what its going to be as Fiat continues the devolution of the Jeep brand.To put it another way Jeep has morphed from a SUV company into a car company.  Its really that simple.,JeepMemes,cfu8wi0,1,t5_2vd7m
