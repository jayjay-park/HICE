Especially in the chest and lats.Im old school body building so for your build I would work on size in the chest and depth in the back. That means high reps at a medlow weight doing presses benchpushups and rowscables best for that. Then hit the lats with some wide grip pulldowns and pullups for the Vtaper.That doesnt mean neglect the rest of your body though be sure to work with proportions.

Now if you ever want to increase the general mass of your physique you need to put in the time to go on a bulk. Id suggest lean bulk but thats way too hard for me at least so I usually go dirty. Its a terrible way of doing things but Ive seen results. You mentioned you had a flat chest well youll never be able to increase the size of your chest unless you eat in a surplus. If what Im telling you isnt anything new well you look great but on a tad bit of the leantoned side with no true big muscle definition. ,BulkOrCut,cm5qxq5,1,t5_2x3i0

8652624,0,t3_4xxsu6,Guy you are  at lb and still aiming for abs. You end up at lb in a deathbed but with abs.

9033152,0,t1_d7uvyrz,I disagree with pretty much everything Gynotity said.Squat Deadlift and particularly OHP do involve significant core activation but for your abs to really pop you should be working them directly. Not necessarily a whole lot just a linear progression of one or two of the best exercises hanging leg raise plank Lsit ab rollout. Every workout if you really want to focus on them as you seem to but even once a week will make a difference.The recent research suggests that  minutes rest intervals are optimal for both strength and hypertrophy.I do agree however that you shouldnt put in too much arm accessory work right now if only because your arms are so far ahead of everything else in these pictures that it makes you look smaller. Keep progressing in all exercises but dont add too much additional volume.,BulkOrCut,d7xn45w,1,t5_2x3i0
9065463,0,t3_54g6xr,So Im about to start week  of SL x. My TDEE is k so Ive been on a bulk of about k eating kday. My lifts have gone up every time except for last week failed bench but Ive always had trouble with benching and just upper body strength in general. I started at lbs right now depending on the day my weight will fluctuate from lbs. From my pics should I continue bulking? Or should I cut down to a lower starting weight and then bulk? Appreciate any comments.,BulkOrCut,d81it45,1,t5_2x3i0

10688955,0,t3_5sw5pd,Posts like this make me question whether or not there should be more restriction on who can post. With  minutes of reading the fitness faq he would know whether to bulk or cut.

10905302,0,t3_5vsbpk,Honestly you probably need to educate yourself about proper training and nutrition. You didnt have the best progress for a year but there is definite noticeable progress. You should be proud of the changes you have made especially because most people do nothing.I would recommend you cut now because you dont have much muscle or fat to lose it will be a shorter cut. Maybe  lbs over  months. This will not help all that much in the short term but what it helps with is being able to bulk longer while not having that extra  lbs of fat on you and when you cut after a longer bulk your cut will be shorter.  month cut vs.  month is vastly different for mental health.,BulkOrCut,de4syv7,2,t5_2x3i0

11446666,0,t3_63bzuk,Bulk. You need to train lots more before thinking about cutting or you will just be more skinny. Take some time to learn your way around a gym. People often recommend Starting Strength it might not be geared towards your goals but its a great way to start out with learning your body and building up some strength while capitalising on beginner gains.,BulkOrCut,dftgwz7,1,t5_2x3i0
