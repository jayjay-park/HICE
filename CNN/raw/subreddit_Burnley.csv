4676793,0,t3_3excl3,Went to this game had a lovely atmosphere even on the seating part of the away fans DI was quite surprised and then quite disgusted that Ben Mee was captain. I really dont think he deserves it nor can he actually pull it off. In fact I think hes easily the worst defender we have at the given moment.What was weirder about the captain thing was that when Mee was subbed around  minutes to go the captaincy went to Keane. Im not sure if it was just cause its a friendly and nobody cares but I really disagree with him being subcaptain if that is indeed the case.For the game itself it was quite a good ATTACKING performance yet a really bad one defensively.. we again got our legs and arms mixed up and almost conceded some stupid goals Mee was actually helpful a couple of times in the late second half.For the attacking part both Ward and Lowton were great in supplying forward runs and Ward even scored a great goal.Other than that it was again Boyd  Arfield who dominated midfield and tried helplessly to supply Sordell with service. Im yet again amazed at how bad Sordells first touch is and how even with his size he cannot hold off defenders or protect the ball. the penalty he scored was from him messing around in the penalty box the fact he actually scored was a surprise for the fans DIn the subs I had to single out Dummigan who played really well and can be a good RB sub if we need one. Ulvestad didnt show a lot but I still think he can help and Juke made a few good runs and a couple of decent shots to his name.Hope I didnt rant too much P,Burnley,ctk24q9,1,t5_2shck
