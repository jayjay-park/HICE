4820180,0,t1_cu1tgs7,Not sure if this is still a thing but there used to be wheel settings on previous games. Turning up the wheel linearity would make it much easier to drive. If its still a thing give it a try.,F1Game,cu24g5g,1,t5_33sdn
5261875,0,t3_3n19ut,Shift for shifting up and control for shifting down would be what I would think the best thing to set them as. However while the game can operate poorly with a keyboard please just dont do it to yourself. It is worth investing money into a gamepad of some kind if you enjoy the game. Obviously if you can afford a wheel do that. But there are some cheap  pc gamepads out there that will make your experience x better. It is an investment that is well worth it considering just how many games operate better on a gamepad. If you still insist on playing with the keyboard another tip would be to get it into your head that you should never be downshifting through a corner. Brake and shift down before the corner turn in hit the apex apply throttle then shift up accordingly. It should be an automatic routine after awhile. Just think before every corner brake shift down turn in. ,F1Game,cvk9gwo,3,t5_33sdn

11527665,0,t1_dg1gm54,If youre in a faster car and can qualify on a harder compound for Q and make it into Q you will start the race on your Q tires. So for strategy purposes you could theoretically get pole position but start on a harder compound that will let you run further into the race. If you stay in front off the start you can run in clear air on a more durable compound and therefore be on a faster tire towards the end of the race guaranteeing that youll have the pace to stay in front. Edit Q tires are returned after quali if Im not mistaken so if youre someone who runs longer race distance saving those Q compounds or not abusing them to heavily will benefit you in the race. I run  percent races normally so its in my interest to make it to Q using a harder compound and attempt to qualify higher but will be starting on a more durable tire. That being said dont run  laps on the tire youve set your fastest time with or youll be pitting on lap  and losing track position due to lower grip,F1Game,dg2nv9x,3,t5_33sdn
