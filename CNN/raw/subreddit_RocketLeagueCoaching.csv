8580778,0,t3_4wtw1t,My advice as a Superstar currently learning to freestyle and air dribble will barely improve your play. The chances to air dribble at higher ranks is rare and freestyles are just for showing off. Learn skills that will actually help you get better. Be fast to aerials learn to ground dribbleflickbounce dribble proper wall hits etc. Playing s a helped me a lot. Also for aerial improvement I played unranked s and went for every aerial possible. Helped my speed of play considerably,RocketLeagueCoaching,d6e6kvk,2,t5_39uoh

10040146,0,t1_dbg8n3e,I find it situational as to whether I turn ball cam off or on when going for an aerial so I cant exactly answer that but I can give a couple general tips for learning to aerial  . Start low dont go for the balls near the ceiling at first. Maybe let it bounce before you go for it. Its easier to judge the lower balls to get an aerial hit on them then you can slowly work your way up as you get comfortable.  . Dont go into an aerial from full speed. Youll find you have a much easier time controlling yourself in the air and judging your distance if youre only acceleratingrather than boosting. This isnt to say you cant aerial out of a full speed boost jump but Id recommend practicing slower aerials first.  . Remember to use your dodge while attempting an aerial. You can only use it for I think  seconds after your wheels leave the ground so if youre up for longer then you wont be able to. However when you can your dodge can be a very effective tool in repositioning at the last second to get your aerial touch in or to provide extra power when hitting the ball.  Im no professional or anything but these are some things I figured out whilst learning to aerial so maybe they can help you too. ,RocketLeagueCoaching,dbg99p8,2,t5_39uoh

11636224,0,t1_dgev8t4,Im assuming he can hit the ball though. Hes got  hours on the clock and the only skill deficiency hes worried about is aerials. Even then  on pro aerial training means that he can physically hit aerials just maybe not as solidly as hed like.The only match I played in bronze recently was a placement match admittedly. I realise that hitting aerials is going to give you the upper hand. But from the info were given this guys aerials should be good enough to win possession off a smallmedium bounce and to cover most of the goal in defence.If hes working his ass off in custom training still in bronze  its almost certainly his positioning and tactics which are letting him down.,RocketLeagueCoaching,dgez8xr,1,t5_39uoh
