1487849,0,t3_2b6fzk,So wait let me get this straight...In the first Avengers the bad guy is Thors brother halfbro yes... and he can effectively be considered to be responsible for his bros evil actions.Yo Thor whats up with your brother?In the second movie it is Starks fault.Yo Start way to tinker us up a global threat...So can we somehow conclude that in the third movie the big villain will be directly connected to an Avenger? If so Id like to pin Thanos reign of terror squarely on the shoulders of... Hawkeye.Cuz fuck that guy.,Avengers,cj2rz7x,1,t5_2sb1u

Being part of SHIELD she had knowledge of Banner and his condition and what the Hulk was capable of.Of all the characters in The Avengers film she most accurately portrayed a real person. How would you react knowing that a person you were standing next to had the capability of turning into an  foot tall  pound monster?Most of us would be crapping our pants. ,Avengers,cke6j9h,4,t5_2sb1u

2625978,0,t1_cn19qgk,gt Cap was being polite hes fully capable of lifting the hammer and has on several occasions.Exactly and in this version of the trailer they even make a point of the table creaking and it wiggling ever so slightly when Cap grabs it. Whether the straining after that was real or Cap acting remains to be seen. Maybe hes almost worthy just not quite there yet in the MCU.,Avengers,cn1co1j,5,t5_2sb1u

4190488,0,t1_crxwo8d,I like to think of hulk as not only a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde dynamic but essentially when he is hulk he is the opposite of banner... He is like a large baby who is afraid and throwing a temper tantrum. So when you see him between the rage he is a scared child. Im glad to hear you say that... It means its working. ,Avengers,crxwyfx,1,t5_2sb1u

7542142,0,t1_d2sp4ig,I actually kind of hate Steve and Bucky after this movie. It was completely unexpected since Winter Soldier was probably my favorite Marvel film with Cap as probably my favorite MCU character so far.By the end of the film I wanted nothing more than to see Black Panther sink those claws into Bucky or for Stark to just blast him in two. I know it wouldnt ever happen in the movie but they made it so easy to understand why Tony was angry.He fought side by side with Steve for years and now he sees Steve burn every bridge he has ever made in his life and betray all of his friends just to save his murdering nutjob of a friend. Bucky isnt some victim he doesnt ever in the film show remorse for what hes done which is a huge contrast to how Stark has had to deal with knowing his weapons had hurt innocent people.Stark telling Steve that he doesnt deserve that shield was right on the money.,Avengers,d2zi70u,8,t5_2sb1u

11566340,0,t1_dg719lv,Thanks so much! Thats very flattering but Im sure Marvel gets too many wouldbewriters pestering them to worry about my glorified fanfiction.I usually post rewrites of movies on my website and the Infinity War series was my first attempt at writing a completely new story. But you can find my other rewrites here! ,Avengers,dg71t4e,1,t5_2sb1u
