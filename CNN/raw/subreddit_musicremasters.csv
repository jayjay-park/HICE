4303194,0,t1_csa9qbm,HDCD is an encoding system used on some CDs mostly in the s and early s. Basically when the disc was mastered some instructions were encoded into the audio data in the least significant bit that a compatible player can decode and use to improve sound quality. Other players are unaffected.One of the things that HDCDs could use is called peak extension. The audio would be dynamically compressed as usual but the HDCD data would instruct the player to expand by exactly the same amount effectively restoring the dynamics. That way you could have a loud master for general listening in the car radio portable and more dynamic sound on a compatible hifi. This isnt the same as the fanmade uncompressed versions of albums this is specifically designed to be reversed like Dolby noise reduction or preemphasis. Not all HDCD discs use peak extension but the one this post is about does.The foobar plugin is a software implementation of a HDCD decoder. Note that you need to be playing the original disc or a lossless rip for it to work lossy compression like MP wipes out the signal.,musicremasters,csap0q5,2,t5_37s19
