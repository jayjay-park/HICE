5714975,0,t3_3spoju,voozers and everyoneThat was just a coincidence but I was joking because I havent heard from Siegfre in a few days. He doesnt live in france. Hes here in murica.... Teqwolf and everyone,TamrielOnline,cx5hybg,1,t5_38u91
6004102,0,t3_3xkafb,If you do get in touch with Siegfre Id like to offer my support in continuing the mod. I cant promise to work on it as much as Siegfre but I could at the very least help transition it to an open source and documentprepare the code for him.,TamrielOnline,cy6o24f,3,t5_38u91
6088489,0,t1_cyhoaav,He suddenly disappeared from internet or at least Steam Reddit and Nexus duh.,TamrielOnline,cyhogbn,5,t5_38u91
6158582,0,t1_cyneuh4,If not his to decide than whose? Most of the community has decided its dead. If its not then maybe Siegfre should break the silence and talk to his community. Silence denotes the death of a project everyone on the Internet knows this. Can you really blame Lagulous for being a bit short? We all believed in Siegfre and he just up and left like every other Skyrim CoOP developer.,TamrielOnline,cypo0w2,2,t5_38u91
6380470,0,t1_czevqr8,He didnt check he didnt ask for permission and I know this because I know many of the mod authors in this pack and they didnt give him permission. Torrents cant be changed after they have been uploaded a new version can be released but that hasnt happened because this guy doesnt respect mod author wishes.Sku is one mod author that is ok with it and if all of the mod authors in this pack agrees as he does then we would have no issue with it being released but it isnt like that.Im saying all this because I know he didnt ask for permission Im saying this because he hasnt respected the wishes for it to be removed and since it is torrent he cant stop it.,TamrielOnline,czew3dx,1,t5_38u91
