1413144,0,t1_citdclu,Last season should have taught you that everything can change with a  word phrase.Also Mike surprised me when he gave Paige some leash to go out and kick down some doors definitely thought he was going to say link it to them then kick down doors not the other way around.Good Mike is still in there he just needs to get out from under the DC thumb and back in Graceland!,Graceland,citf0c7,4,t5_2vbht

1881241,0,t1_ckfv55n,Ya thats what i meant by Briggs knowing Mike is alive and Mike staying in the shadows planning the way he brings down Sid and in turn once Sid confessing he got the info from Paige then he brings down Paige. I agree most likely they wont do what i said because that would mean a star female actor is off the show and they gotta bring in a new character to replace her especially if Mike is dead they are down  characters from their show. I honestly dont think Mike is dead...i mean it happened in a Hospital...come on now. He gets revived. ,Graceland,ckfvs15,3,t5_2vbht
1904504,0,t3_2g1yar,The show felt kinda all over the place this season and the characters personalities changed significantly between seasons offscreen. They also continued to change within the season itself but it felt pretty contrived at times  and frankly I seriously dislike what most of the characters have become especially Paige in the finale for obvious reasons.Its okay to have morally gray characters like Briggs and Mike as long as you actually bother to address what they did and handle it seriously instead of basically brushing it under the rug just waiting to bring it back up near the finale as half this season did with Badillos tape... But there are certain things that cant be redeemed. Telling the bad guy what hospital your former friendlover is in when you know the bad guy wants to kill him is knowingly condemning him to death. And thats not the sort of thing you can come back from. Also What a petty reason to do so. Yes I understand Paige is upset that Mike covered up Linas death to keep the operation going. Still not really worth getting him killed and letting the rest of the bad guys operations continue over.I am not opposed to character development but it has to feel natural  and so many things this season felt contrived. A lot of the characters did stupid things but they did not feel particularly relatable it just seemed like the writers were trying to drum up conflict. There were some vaguely interesting plotlines this seasons but the show really ruined the characters. How am I supposed to keep watching a show if it makes nearly every character unlikable?Also no way Mikes dying. This is USA Network. Mike is one of the two main characters  and Briggs isnt carrying the show by myself. Im sure theyll bring him back almost right away. And then he can go kick Paiges ass since Sid conveniently told Mike that she was the one who told him where Mike was....I just hope the writers figure their shit out next season assuming its renewed. I really hope they can get back to what made season  so good.,Graceland,ckioj4q,1,t5_2vbht
