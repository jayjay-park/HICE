41682,0,t1_cej5fkq,gtupset you greatlyIts called annoyed.And sure its not unreasonable just childish and immature. Adults know how to divorce connotation from a word when given context so worrying youll be perceived as a religious type for saying It was a miracle I passed that test or you are so blessed to have a good family is ludicrous and smug. Just say the word no one is going to invite you to church or ordain you pope if you use the term soul or blessed. On top of that the only way words evolve is through their use in novel circumstances...by avoiding their use completely you are actively hindering them from losing a religious connection. ,whatstheword,cej6d23,-4,t5_2sjdt

In your sentences the focus is on OPs contacts list. It is the object of the first sentence and the subject of the second. Rather OP is trying to convey the person he is. OPs sentence has I as the subject. Got contacts is a conversational way of saying that he has a large social network.

It also occurs when an emotional response is repeatedly evoked in situations in which the action tendency that is associated with the emotion proves irrelevant or unnecessary. Desensitization is a process primarily used to assist individuals unlearn phobias and anxieties and was developed by psychologist Mary Cover Jones   Joseph Wolpe  developed a method of a hierarchal list of anxiety evoking stimuli in order of intensity which allows individuals to undergo adaption.

The lifeboat is in an ocean surrounded by a hundred swimmers. The ethics of the situation stem from the dilemma of whether and under what circumstances swimmers should be taken aboard the lifeboat.gtHardin compared the lifeboat metaphor to the Spaceship Earth model of resource distribution which he criticizes by asserting that a spaceship would be directed by a single leader  a captain  which the Earth lacks. Hardin asserts that the spaceship model leads to the tragedy of the commons In contrast the lifeboat metaphor presents individual lifeboats as rich nations and the swimmers as poor nations.gtInteresting Lifeboat economics | Garrett Hardin | Lifeboat shipboard Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcpfeoab oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecpfeoab.

So one could affect a posture of indifference or aloofness.The verb feign is very similar but tends to have a connotation of deception so it may be closer to what you are looking for.You could describe the person as unforthcoming since your post had the implication that someone was being asked about themselves and seemed reluctant to reveal any information.

11229268,0,t3_608x0c,An old radio would have been totally analog so it wouldnt sound compressed. Thats what happens when a sound is converted to digital and then reduced in size like an mp or or Opus file before being replayed. Often what happens is they cut off the highest and lowest sounds so you get a less full sound.Noisy and staticky would be synonyms. The random signals picked up and amplified by mics recording media transmission or even loose connections cause a layer of white noise usually at a constant level. This is more evident in quieter parts of a recording think the space between songs on an old tape.Tinny is the sound you get from older cheaper hardware. With smaller speakers or just cheaper ones you cant get a decent bass. All you hear is treble and mid. This can be replicated on most midhighrange stereos today by adjusting the eq settings. Just turn the bass all the way down and youll get that old radio sound. Loudspeakers get an echo sound not because of the speakers but because of where they are. Auditoriums stadiums under domes around buildings.. .those are all places with hard smooth surfaces that bounce sound around like crazy. Fixing this usually means installing soundabsorption material. Theres also feedback. When a mic and a speaker get too close together any tiny little sound will be sent out of the speaker into the mic out of the speaker into the mic... you get the idea. This causes a feedback loop and the sound rapidly increases in volume until it maxes out the speaker volume. In systems with fast response times very little delay between saying something and hearing it you get a whine. In system with some latency you get a pulsing whubwhubwhub sound. Generally the way to fix this is moving the mic away from the speaker or at least pointing the speaker away from the mic. Turning down mic gain can also help.Theres lots of words to describe bad audio and trying to pick one to describe everything is somewhat selfdefeating. Its like trying to describe a bad dish with one word. Theres lots of words that could be used but they wont all be accurate in all cases. ,whatstheword,df4tmi9,1,t5_2sjdt
