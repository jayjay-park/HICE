10264093,0,t3_5mz7iy,crawl in deep? ok!I recommend having Naberus. Those will make you look like a vampire very much indeed. Or at least like a bat lord.Youre going to not have much red aside from energy colour. The energy colour makes up a lot of Trinity Prime so you really wont need it. Rather just make her black maybe with silver or bronze metallics.As for the syandana choose whether you want wings or a cape. If you have Naberus on you probably want to go with the cape unless you want  wings. If you want wings to be more bat lord you might consider that kryptoteria or whatever its called.,WarframeRunway,dc7hoic,3,t5_37rrb
