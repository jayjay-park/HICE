1516421,0,t3_2bjiv1,Lets be honest here Bowman blindsided Andre Roberts a   pound receiver and he got launched in front of Michael Floyd who incidentally tripped over him. Navarro did not actually take out both of them. ,nflgifs,cj6cywp,17,t5_2t1wr
1592779,0,t3_2cixde,Thats a dangerous way of covering a receiver. Rhodes flipped his head when Jennings cut to the post. Turning your head like that is only good when you know for sure what route which could be the case seeing as they are in practice. If Jennings is running a postcorner and he gets the corner to turn his head like that on the post Hell cut back while hes turning and its a TD instead of just a big play. Watch yourself Rhodes. ,nflgifs,cjfxuy1,8,t5_2t1wr

1722568,0,t1_cjw8hcl,His eyes were in at the QB the whole time. Im assuming they were in a man coverage with safety help over top. He wasnt paying attention to the receiver which is the number  priority in man coverage. He also was lazy in his form. He was practically standing up in his back pedal which makes you slower and less athletic. If he was lower he could of turned faster. ,nflgifs,cjwal8v,1,t5_2t1wr
