4721340,0,t1_ctpnr0p,I am very much open to feminism. Im not worried about whether this sub will contain decent discussing and debate I just have this feeling that this sub isnt going to pertain  to issues that men face but rather issues men face due to the patriarchy and how feminism will help them overcome this. What I mean to say is I dont want this sub to turn into a place where feminists or mens rights activists try and inject their agenda. I think that ideally this place would serve as a sort of common ground area between the two if that makes any sense. And as to your question of what I think a radical feminist is I suppose the broadest definition I could give would be a feminist who believes that men are the sole reason as to why there is suffering in the world and that men are in debt to women because of all the things they have caused. Again this is a loose definition as I have seen feminists like this called the general norm of feminism and other see them as more extreme.

This anxiety is not the only thing to discuss here of course  but I think its worth considering the ways it fuels the arguments and tensions.People who labour under such complicated cultural anxiety things should not be exonerated for taking it in bad directions but neither should we just brand them as deluded or malicious.,MensLib,ctrmt82,35,t5_38jid

They would also let the old and the sick in before me. And thats good of them. I dont think anyone is in a position to complain when theyre subsisting mostly on volunteer labor. These shelters dont turn you away because youre a man they turn you away because they have to allocate resources very carefully and they are very slim. Insisting otherwise is just short of a persecution complex but thats not how it works. Like I said in literally every aid project across the board help goes to the most vulnerable first. Just like if Im sitting in the hospital with a broken nose theyre going to treat the guy with cardiac arrest first. Thats not wrong of them. gtI remember an interview in my country with a political representative head of a city district about homelessness where she claimed that it was not bad for men because for them it was just an opportunity to party on the streets with lots of alcohol.

4779584,1,t1_ctwvtoa,IMO its not about the messages we are sending the models its about the messages we send young children that our worth is predicated on how much we look like the people on TV. For women its often nearly unobtainable proportions narrow hips large breasts etc and for men its this muscle bound testosterone oozing body builders. Yes they spent a lot of time getting that way nobody is saying that its bad to appreciate them. But when we tell our children that if they dont look like these men or supermodels or whatever theyre worth less thats a problem. Children internalize those messages and suffer real psychological damage when they are almost always unable to meet that standard. Because a lot of people could never look like those models no matter how many weights they lifted and even those that could have jobs and obligations that prevent them from spending  hours at the gym every day.

4785337,0,t1_ctxq2we,gtI am a layperson and you seem like you know a lot about the subject how do they diagnose it? If you look up the diagnostic criteria they all boil down to acts like a child. But of course a  year old acts like a child. Do they actually have a rigorous test that does not depend on the word of the parentsteachers?Theres nothing in the criteria that can be understood as acts like a cold when you take into account that each one needs to be viewed in the context of the concept of mental disorder. For example something like  Often fails to give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork at work or with other activities. is understood as saying this occurs at a much greater frequency and severity compared to their peers that it significantly affects their well being and measurably impacts their functioning. If being a kid is defined as persistently displaying extreme maladaptive behaviors in ways that causes them to become distressed and impairs their ability to carry out basic functions then we know different types of kids. As for the rigorous tests they are usually behavioral measures that need to find consistent results across various environments and activities ie its not enough to show the symptoms at school. Reports from parents teachers and the children obviously feed into the diagnosis but ultimately it depends on what the data shows. gtDefinitely not. She had lots of problems but this aint one.Its not possible that she had behaviors on the cusp where coping mechanisms were enough to handle it? gtWe wont know because we never saw her struggle in school. Maybe she would have maybe she wouldnt have. But the concern was purely behaviorbased.Well its a behavioral disorder so wed hope it was behaviorbased.But my point was more that when it comes to psych medication people often worry about potential side effects and yet dont focus on the side effects or negative outcomes from not being treated. We dont see this in other disease treatments as parents generally dont question the side effects of chemotherapy without weighing it against the problems that come with not getting chemo. ,MensLib,ctxqccv,1,t5_38jid

4787843,0,t1_ctxu1ie,From my perspective theres really no such thing as crying but only sweating from the eyes.That is it happens if you have such great emotional exertion that you cant mentally cope with it any more As soon as you deal with the underlying emotion the physiological impulse vanishes.And with exertion I dont mean the strength of the emotion itself but how hard it is to snatch out of the thought stream pet and cuddle it and then let it be off on its merry way.Thus if there is something that could bring me to the point of tears if I left it alone I can try to let it go into that direction... but then feel so silly about not just dealing with the thing that in the end I just do deal with it.As such if we want to analyse something here when it comes to peoplewhodontcry I think it should be how people are doing that dealingwith whether its healthy psychologically speaking or not. ...to avoid getting into endless detail about what mentally dealing with something actually entails,MensLib,cty1ovd,2,t5_38jid

4794559,0,t1_cty8ukd,I absolutely  agree with you.When I wrote this it was never meant to be a debate of the validity of the concept of privilege you have laid out.I consider myself profeminist purely on how the dictionary defines it. Anything else is too personal of a definition for me to identify with. Im trying to say that I support the existence of a womens advocacy group. I see my privilege for what it is. Ive listened to BOTH sides impartially. I get it. Its a simple concept. Were all tired of debating it.Why are you trying to define privilege for me? Just because it is a concept does not mean that the dictionary use of the word should be prohibited. That is what I was trying to say throughout my entire post. If you noticed there was a lot of people trying to defend their definition of privilege here. If they had read my post in good faith they would realize that was exactly what I was asking them NOT to do.The semantics of such a thing are not in the spirit of an intersectional approach. If we are accept the privileges we have over another person we should understand them at a fundamental level. When you use the dictionary definition of privilege you are allowing people to join the discussion on a common level. You cannot expect someone to just accept that the dictionary is wrong.The way a lot of people see privilege is personal. Allowing people to see the privileges they dont have is a great way for them to see the ones they do have. This is why we absolutely need to accept the fact that women receive privileges. We do not have the right to assume that women are the privileged gender. However the idea of equality is not a zero sum game if you are looking to right the balance of equality need to look at both sides. That is what we are trying to do here.Women are not the privileged gender that isnt up for debate. They receive privileges from the same system that gives men privileges. They receive disadvantages of the same system that gives men advantages. Men receive disadvantages from the same system. The entire issue is not a flow chart but a web of intersecting sexist behavior that affects us all in different ways.So when someone is arguing with you over the semantics of your definition its not because we are trying to play oppression olympics. Its because we are trying to be intersectional. If we are going to talk about the issues that face men. We need to accept the fact that these things are happening. To the nonfeminists these differences reflect a difference of privilege. And by the dictionary they are absolutely correct. Because they havent seen the bigger picture yet.And neither have the feminists who are telling them that they are wrong. The very fact that the person they are correcting can see the scale shows they intuitively understand the concept in some way. Its that your definition actually goes against the heart of what you are trying to accomplish when you look at it rationally. We shouldnt be fighting over whos more oppressed because that isnt what we mean when we are talking about privilege in the common tongue. Privilege is when somebody is given something you are not because of how they are different. Simple. Elegant.The common person can generally agree that men and women each receive privileges the other does not. It does not take a PHD to admit that we are benefited by the system. When you come across this revelation naturally as I have you do not see the word privilege as sacred. I did not have a group of people telling me that I cannot be privileged. When I saw my privilege I saw the privilege others had over me and I saw the privilege I had over them.That is what it means to be intersectional. We are profeminist. We are not fighting against you receiving the same privileges we do. We are fighting to receive the same ones you do. That sounds like equality to me. The world has already agreed on what the words mean. Let us use them to understand how we can all be better people.,MensLib,ctyw5zq,3,t5_38jid

4797003,0,t1_ctz6i7y,gtThe problem with your argument is that youre taking it to a logical extreme and ignoring the other points Ive made upthread.What can I say I just find it a little curious that youve constructed your arguments in exactly the way to criticise making generalisations about the group youre defending and only them.gtGeneralizations about men as a group are less likely to be correct but theyre also less likely to be taken as universal truth because men is such a large group that everyone knows some who fall under the generalization and some who dont. The same is true of a lot of other generalisations that are usually condemned  what of it?gtThats true. I draw the line at the point where I cant see the positive arguments through the hatespeech and prejudice.I have no problem with nonidentification with or criticism of these groups because of personal bad experience with them.  I do that myself.  But its just that your personal experience rather than some objective measure of what groups are and are not acceptable.  I think too often people debating the existence of the MRMfeminism mistake the former for the latter.gtA thing can be true and still completely irrelevant and actively harmful. Not All Men is true obviously true to anyone whos had the argument used against them. Unless theyre Amazons from Greek myth they have fathers husbands brothers and friends who probably dont do what theyre talking about. But theyve also known a lot of people who do or else they wouldnt be making the argument. Which makes you wonder why appropriately qualifying their remarks is too much to ask.gtThe problem with Not All Men is that it actively shuts down the important part of the conversation which is that Enough Men do for the problem to exist and Enough Men arent proactive about fixing it and reframes the problem to be about how men who are the ones who as a group have the power and privilege are wronged and slighted.Well firstly no man should have to fix anything other men have done simply because he is a man.  At least not until its acceptable to make gendered demands of women to step up to fix mens issues in the same way or to help men because some tiny minority of women were shitty to men at one point.  So really Im not too concerned about disrupting those sorts of sentiments.And yes men are being wronged and slighted whenever they are generalised.  It is entirely possible for that aspect of the exchange to be true too.  As Ive said before too many accusations of derailingwhatabouttehmenz are actually people correcting unfair generalisations of men.  If people dont want to be interrupted when theyre on their soapbox maybe they could consider their words a little more?It is after all no less than these feminists expect of men.gtIm laughing here. Of course things have gotten worse Relinquishing power tends to make your life less good. But as the power comes into balance and toxic ideas of gender roles are broken down eventually everyones lot in life inasmuch as gender has an effect will get better.Really?  Im really hoping you didnt mean to claim that the continuing failure of feminists and society at large to meaningfully address issues like the rape of men by women the growing education gap between men and women the sentencing gap etc. is actually proof that feminism is working and working positively.Because that would seem massively fucked up to me.  It seems like an unnecessarily zero sum approach to the whole problem.gtAlso... Exactly how would you propose to stop a bad guy with a gun? cause let me tell you hes gonna get one if he wants one and once he does unarmed protest isnt going to take it away.Its not so much a statement on gun control but an alternative example of how when something has either been not helping a situation or making a situation worse its entirely possible the last thing the situation needs is more of that something.,MensLib,ctz7903,2,t5_38jid

If you were to accept the first claim then Id respond to the second by pointing out that the vast majority of domestic abuse cases have men as the sole abusers and in the majority of cases where women are considered to be the abuser or primary abuser it is in reciprocal violence cases. Cases where women are the sole abuses appear to be much rarer. In that situation I see it as roughly accurate that the Duluth model focuses mostly on male violence has the Crossroads program for women in reciprocal violence situations and thinks that the legal system is adequate enough to deal with the rest as they dont have a solid theoretical or therapeutic framework to deal with them.,MensLib,cu2mmc7,-2,t5_38jid

4864863,0,t1_cu7qkgg,Not really in maybe the way youre thinking of it and its still a mediumhotly debated topic. What youre describing is environmental determinism with some slight differences and its mostly not regarded well by modern anthropologists for a lot of reasons.We do have some social order and stuff left over from our biological background but even thats in our distant distant past. Anatomically modern Humans have been around for  kya now and most of us have been in an agrarian society for kya with some exceptions and now a primarily urban society for the past  where most people live in an urban setting. We dont conform to biological laws of nature outside of how we are on a biological level say sexual dimorphism but even that can get shifted due to things like malnutrition or stresses such as height for an example. but even tehn we still have societyculture and the individual to contend with and theyre generally not biologically predicated either. We arent being changed by our environment to fit it better we are changing our environment to fit us better. Evolution is incredibly slow to begin with and we really havent changed all that much in our time of existence. You can have two completely different cultures right next to each other with completely different components and variables. One might have cross cousin arranged marriages next door it might be self selected marriages. yes theres an underlying biological engineering that can come into play  how we build design homes cities etc. One minor example is that people who would build buildings could have variable ceiling heights. Sometimes nails would be pounded flat against the ceiling sometimes they might stick out with the sharpy pointy ends. If a ceiling was high enough where no one would slam their heads against the ceiling theyd pound them flush against the ceiling others would just leave them as is. So we can sort of infer whether a ceiling was low or high.That kind of thing. The issue becomes that people start wanting to find scientific reasons! to justify terrible actions or behaviors. A lot of the hallmarks for modern Stormfront level racism comes straight from th century anthropology. Same with a lot of sexism.  years ago it would have been women have to unsex themselves to become doctors. Whatever unsex meant but primarily that they were going against the laws of nature of woman as mother and provider. Biotruthers dont tap that hard into it but theres a lot of that similar constructs being played out.Thats way too much info for that question but I hope that helps.,MensLib,cu7r4lv,3,t5_38jid

Thats about as serious as it can get yet still she wont spend a single day in jail.Or you can have a  year old woman have sex with a  year old boy and get a little jail time then probation Or a  year old woman who admitted to raping a  year old boy and got probation Its just really upsetting that society doesnt find boy victims of this kind of thing worthy of protection. Heres a good article on it its a bit old and while things have gotten a bit better they havent gotten that much better. Perhaps the best example of the double standard is here gtIn  in Virginia a male teacher who had sex with three teenage female students was sentenced to  years in prison  while the next day a female swimming coach who had an affair with an yearold boy and sexual encounters with two others got  days.,MensLib,cuau01s,12,t5_38jid

4933772,0,t3_3igqgv,Personally I think there is some subtlety lacking in your friends approach and in people who are universally critical of the nonnice guy approach.When you are flirting with someone there generally needs to be some kind of pushpull going on.  That doesnt mean faking disinterest or actually being a dick.  It doesnt meant not treating someone with respect but it means keeping things playful and not too serious right off the bat.  That is a date is an opportunity for two people to develop interest in one another.  If you appear too interested without actually getting to know the person then thats kind of weirder than if you were icy.  Thats the bad nice guy you are attractive so Ill be nice to you for sex.  Even if you dont intend this its possible that being too nice may come off this way.You can be an empathetic person while also knowing when to playfully tease someone.  I cant think of a single platonic or romantic relationship Ive ever had where there wasnt some teasing that went on at some point.  Even my grandmother and I mess with each other.I think its also important to keep in mind that flirting is a social skill.  For many people it comes naturally but actively learning a skill like this does not mean you are being fake.  The point is to show interest but only insofar as that interest is justified.  Its actually much more respectful imo than showing unjustified interest.,MensLib,cugfw6m,1,t5_38jid

4947086,0,t1_cueee66,Can you think of a reason why you didnt notice the duality nature of sexism before?Out of curiosity.By the wayThe perceived lack of people having this insight you are talking about is a huge driving force in antifeminism and the MRM.Im aware this is a feminist sub and im only just back but I think this is worth mentioning for this post because the thread here is great.I think a lot of peoples understanding of sexism has a female gaze problem.Women developed and codified the theory of sexism and how to view it. This led to people interpreting each sexism event as one that victimizes women in favor of men when as you point out thats not really the case and that view may well prevent actually solving the problem.I also think this contributes to the lack of men in the feminist movement because what its talking about is a completely alien perspective to men. Not only that but as I point out elsewhere it encourages men to view the issue in terms of how it effects women and to act on sexism to help women. Almost like you know their wellbeing was your responsibility. As opposed to allowing men to develop an internal framework to view sexism and oppose it out of selfrespect and such. I think this problem means a lot of men just give in when women make appeals to traditionalist sexism with no woman to protect theres no problem and even if you think there is arguing you are being discriminated against to a woman as a man is something a lot of men just give up at the thought of some dont even consider it some try and have women who DO know this but still knowingly abuse their social power to derail the criticism some try and women who lack this perspective on sexism dismiss the idea and some try and succeed.This ALSO drives antifeminist sentiment and the sense that it is a supremacy movement.Allowing men an internal framework changes that.Theres been a problem of people insisting over and over that its a vase.Then men take a look and say youre a liar its two faces.Both fail to understand that the existence of one brings forth the other.All sexist incidents are a matter of interpretation on whether they are misogyny or misandry.I think the feminist movement has made the mistake of asserting a particular interpretation as gospel for understandable reasons but that this has caused it to make big mistakes in terms of policy as well as alienated potential converts.Ive seen some feminists agree with the duality model but not as many as ive seen asserting All Is Misogyny And The Patriarchy.Then again ive also seen the former view grow slightly over time.From your new perspective would you agree that prior to you realizing this your old worldview now seems quite hateful or apathetic towards mens problems?You now understand why people say feminists hate men and dont care about their issues.Its because a lot of them dont because of this problem you just overcame. What they care about is womens perspective on mens issues. If you want to know how to get a much better wave of feminism going its to emphasize this point.Now this is where it gets real hairy.You pointed out the academia is clung to.How wed put it in the MRM isFeminism has been institutionalized and this results in the oppression of men. Do you see how they could think that?What we mean is a bunch of people who do not understand this revelation of yours are enforcing their view on society and indoctrinating people into believing it. Added to that is the cultural idea that you should be hostile to people challenging this system.And then you just how good old vested interests and money to keep it all together.Difficult to say Gender studies was all only half the story my degree is almost pointless without talking to men about their experiences too unless im aiming to just entrench biases for women. Far easier to say No what I learned at university is the whole truth. It has to be. My paycheck depends on it. And when the latter sort of people start piling up in a profession especially one where your peers have influence over your success youve got a big problem for anyone who wants to tell the emperor hes naked. This dynamic has happened with a lot of stuff before. Feminists on the ground may be wildly different to what Manufactured feminists are.And now youve got a bunch of professionals pushing the same flaw in the media and in institutions and such.Then you throw on the penance overtones that occasionally rear their head of Well mens complaints about anything are meh because women have it so hard and have for centuries so anything that happenswe do is just payback. in some women though not many And more depressingly some men say this type of crap too but it still forms a part of mens experience of feminism as an idea that women can and some have used this to justify doing things that they acknowledge are petty and sexist bullshit but that they dont care something which is impossible to justify without lacking this insight the feeling of demonization for all problems all of the problems stemming from your old perspective basically drive the notion that feminism is a hate movement.Now add that from our perspective feminists actively campaign against and shut down or try to discredit people who reject the patriarchal model of sexism thus keeping the flawed view in place.From that perspective do you now understand why the MRM and antifeminists think the feminist movement is oppressive to men and such? Because I think understanding why they think that in addition to encouraging people to have this revelation will probably be necessary for gender equality to ever succeed. Normally I see shit like they are just afraid of losing their privilege. or They just dont understand feminism. but as youre now aware thats not the case. I think feminists who believe in the duality model need to be a lot louder in their advocacy and proactive in challenging feminists who dont. I dont think weve got much of a chance otherwise.The MRM considers Feminism to be your view prior to your revelation.Lots of MRAs would deny you are a feminist now.I personally dont care what people call themselves but do personally use feminist the same way the MRM does because theres not a word for it otherwise that im aware of.This is also why the menslib sub was received both well and mockingly.To the MRM the notion of a mens movement that utilizes the femalegaze ideology is laughable especially since you cannot reject fundamental parts of that gaze as innacurate despite the fact its regularly speculatory about mens reasons for behaving certain ways A direct consequence of trying to build a complete narrative from only one genders perspective while still trying to figure out the other ones motivations rationales etc. Feminism fails to properly evaluate men but is true of womens experience of sexism and their thought process in response to it. And yes even their speculation on the motivations of men are interesting when they differ from mens actual motivations and rationalizations for behavior and stuff is good. Thats useful. Its interesting data. We can use that to get clues for where sexism may be lurking in our behaviors and outlooks. Its why I support the mens rights movement too even when they speculate on why women sometimes do things and some of the speculation is that they are just evil and hate menare totally selfish.  I think those moments are interesting because they show a disconnect between the genders. There is very little point in trying to combat a problem if you dont allow yourselves to openly talk and engage in it. We should be saying out entire opinions about the other gender without fear of sexist remark so that the data can be looked over compared and then we can discuss why certain things are inaccurate or hurtful etc. We shouldnt be avoiding the appearance of being sexist if were trying to fix sexism. Its counter productive. It restricts us from being totally open and frank with our opinions. I think the call out culture prevents progress.. Their assertion that feminism being challenged is a mens rights issues entirely true for their conception of feminism.Ive previously said that whether or not the feminist movement is the movement for gender equality depends on whether it can adapt to duality. If it insists on retaining a gynocentric view of sexism it isnt the movement for gender equality and never was we merely mistook it for one.If it adapts then this is just another evolution of the movement.,MensLib,cui4c8p,3,t5_38jid

Women are the majority in graduates.  So the only logical conclusion is they were discouraged because better options became available in other fields they felt were better options.   Women graduate more employers have affirmative action and some even either have programs or bonuses that apply for a tech related job.   Outcome will never be equal among genders in any job because the interest is not equal and thats OK because of freedom of choice.  The only plausible solution would be communism or socialism in order to force equal outcome. gt they were discouraged.Discouragement can come from many sources from their own interest in other fields their own performance to letting an idiot get to them  welcome to a males perspective when dealing with coworkersclassmates in a given field.

You cant have it both ways  you cant prioritize career over spending time with family and then expect judges to view you as an equally involved parent.I agree. When you look at the history of feminism and how women achieved being able to have a career it was a bloody sometimes literally battle. Its not like society just woke up one day and decided hey heres an idea lets allow women to have a career and earn lots of money to be financially independent or even rich!. It only happened because a lot of women wanted it very much let their desire be known instend of staying silent and fought hard about it. When I hear about but gender roles dont allow men to ask for more time with their family and being valued as parents more! I cant help but think about the equivalent in feminism  gender roles also didnt allow women to be financially independent or achieve power at workplace. Many original feminists were fighting for it with nails and teeth sometimes even having to starve suffer in prison or risk death for it. I think these days it would be easier for men to break this gende role of being the sole providers and secondarycomplementary parents than it was for women back then because our society now is much more open and tolerant than it was a hundred years ago. Or at least officially it is of course there are still plenty of people who think otherwise.But yes I agree that its just not going to happen if men themselves dont start massively fighting for it and demanding it. And yes you cant be viewed as equally involved parent if you work  hours per week and barely even know the names of your childrens friends.,MensLib,cvp64cd,1,t5_38jid
5303015,0,t1_cvnjuh2,I dont intend to prolong this discussion. We disagree and wont convince each other otherwise though I would like to clear up some points.gt When is violence ever promoted as a solution to a mans problems in any modernized society especially when a woman is involved?Lets take media male violence is glorified both for entertainment and plot development. Often our lone warrior male protagonist will assert his goodness over a rival by defeating them physically. Men who shy away from violence are portrayed as emasculated cowardly and often villainised. Anger is one of the very limited emotions men are allowed to show.We see this manifested in men who lash out against insults and criticism. This occurs along a spectrum  ranging from hostility verbal and physical intimidation to straight up threats of taking things outside. All humans have a capacity for violence though mens thresholds are weakened through it being tied to our manhood refusing to fight is viewed as shameful and losing implies the position we argue is less valid.We set up stronger thresholds for violence against women and children yet fail to address impulses for violence tied to the male gender role. Men who answer to their wives however mildly are whipped henpecked have their balls in a felt purse. Violence is a means of regaining control theyre assured is entitled to them. gt How can you justify the usage of the words many and all here?Many is relative though all means that no men live in a vacuum and each of us are subject to these sociocultural vectors and stereotypes about manhood.gt What fault of it is to the culture and men at large that a small handful of deviant men grossly misinterpret and pervert it?The point being made is that there isnt a misinterpretation.If there is a strong climate of antiimmigration and desperation from working class people to see jobs taken by outsiders yet their is cultural disapproval against committing hate crimes should we expect the latter to be a sufficient barrier against racialised violence without addressing the former?gt How can they be validated by a culture that hates their guts?This might be related to her North African context but there are certainly prominent subcultures of violence against women in the west.Take subs like pussypassdenied where disproportionate violence is salivated over and preemptive strikes are permissible        Theres also strong apologia for domestic violence see here with Sean Connery someone with a history of DV victim blaming i.e. Why doesnt she just leave? She should stop pushing his buttons.Artists like Eminem have built careers while writing about explicitly violent fantasies toward partners and expartners. Sean Penn Chris Brown Michael Fassbender Roman Polanski Floyd Mayweather Charlie Sheen Mel Gibson etc. have all had andor have successful careers amidst being known wifebeaters. Meanwhile Kehas career is deemed over after coming forward with rape charges.DV victims and DV in general are often made the butt of jokes What do you tell a woman with two black eyes?

If too much foreskin is cut away as the person grows up and eventually gets an erection the skin may pull too tight and can be exceptionally painful. The point of foreskin is to accommodate an erection Source Ok lets say now that the circumcision wasnt botched and a dude has a penis without foreskin. The foreskin plays a major role in heterosexual sex. The foreskin creates a barrier with the vulva during penetration. It creates a sort of natural lubricant. The prepuce enables the penis toslip  in  and  out  of  the  vagina  nonabrasivelyinside   its   own   sheath   of   self   lubricatingmovable skin. The female is thus stimulated bymoving pressure rather than by friction only aswhen the males prepuce is missing. Source second page last two sentences of the first full paragraph. This source is also excellent in explaining that men who are circumcised have a higher chance on contracting STDs. This one suggests that there are HIVtargeting cells in the foreskin even.I think your question about why it is so bad begins and ends with consent. Infant circumcision is morally wrong imo because it isnt taking into account what the child wants to have done to his own body. There is no easy reversal once this process is done.I would suggest that you browse rforeskinrestoration. A subreddit dedicated to the discussion and attempt to regrow a lost foreskin. I realize that there are many differing opinions on this but I personally find it hard to support circumcision after reading about how robbed some men feel about not having their foreskin.,MensLib,cw5muwi,13,t5_38jid

5449211,0,t1_cw86mkd,Yeah I dont disagree with you but we decided that because it was in the context of a sexual assault we would let it slide this time. FWIW I think the reasoning that because women can get abortions men should be able to financially abort is weak. Theyre just different situations. I support abortion because there is no harm done by aborting a baby. Once the baby is born they have to be cared for somehow. And besides women have to pay child support if they dont have custody. As far as I know men are free to sue for custody and give their child up for adoption if they so choose. Not being forced to undergo potentially traumatic and lethal physical changes and if anyone is reading this and wants to argue that child support can be potentially physically traumatic and lethal pleas save it. They cant be in the same sort of direct sense that having a human growing inside of you can is different from being forced to give up a portion of your income for the well being of a child that already exists. ,MensLib,cw86tp2,1,t5_38jid
5458714,0,t1_cw8zbnr,To be honest life has taught me that people who behave poorly are often looking for an excuse for their behaviour and that this is no exception. I dont think that its a social norm I think its just that these people are simply douchebags and that male bonding is just the most common excuse.To put that into context while Ive always been a popular guy Ive NEVER had a lasting meaningful relationship with any guy who has behaved this way to me. Theyve all just followed the same pattern of continuing the behaviour incrementally up until it crossed the line and I cut them off.The line they cross is usually the one between friendly teasing and thinly veiled insultsridicule. My theory on why they do this is that the vast majority of these people woke up one day to discover that they can make themselves feel better by insulting others and get away with it by framing it as a boystrous teasing joke. The whole thing is deeply rooted in feelings of insecurity and low self esteem.Ive also learned the hard way that the better you are in their eyes the more attractive popular talented intelligent the more they want to bring you down and the more satisfaction they derive from doing so.,MensLib,cw9ehwx,21,t5_38jid

But the waiting time to get on hrt is also long and a lot of people cannot live full time as their gender without it because they are not perceived by others as their gender ie they do not pass. Which is often detrimental to the whole process and its very to say you need real life experience as your gender but if you dont pass you dont get that experience. Just a lot of pain and mistreatment. In terms of just genital reassignment it is different if that person already passes then it helps to have time before hand.

Theres kind of a steep learning curve with a lot of them so please dont hesitate to message me if you have any questions though the only one Im really fluent in is Brogue. Also rroguelikes is a friendly community that can help you get started. Just so you know what to expect the main things that make roguelikes different from other games are Procedural generation. What this means is that the dungeon levels enemy placements and item placements are usually randomly generated so theyre different every time. Thats what makes them so replayable. Permadeath. In most roguelikes you cant reload your saves. So when you die you die. But the games are usually meant to be short and its alright since procedural generation makes replaying the game not boring. Ascii graphics. All of the games I listed have tiled versions but traditionally roguelikes use ascii for their graphics. Your character is represnted by an at sign a troll might be a T potions are often exclamation points etc. When I first started playing I basically refused to touch anything that didnt have tiles but now I prefer ascii because it lets your imagination fill in the blanks better than tiles do.

Bisexual can exist within the binary gendersex paradigm but doesnt have to.Pansexual is basically bisexual but explicitly acknowledges and includes the nonbinary.I also like the concepts of heterobihomo romantic as separate from their associated sexualities. For instance a guy I was talking to at one point was bisexual but homoromantic He could and did enjoy sex with both men and women but didnt ever foresee himself falling in love with anyone but a man.I honestly think that straight and gay will eventually fall by the wayside in favor of more accurate terminology.

Its a very common underlining concept in rights discussions. Proponents of any cause tend to look for someone or something to blame. Its much easier to identify an external source of oppression than it is to look introspectively and realize the seemingly paradoxical fact that you can contribute to your own oppression. I think this is closely tied into your idea of critical discussion. Its a gap in the thought process that many people have difficult in overcoming but its necessary for the change we seek.

Many people would rather subject themselves to advertising than pay up front for things but this has the added effect of normalizing polarized thinking.Ideally advertising would be informational and obviously the state of advertising varies from place to place but I worry that placing all the blame on the individual is unjust when hundreds of corporations thousands of times more powerful than them constantly push propoganda.EDIT To clarify this is in response to the no reason to need part.

That includes inperson meatspace live conversations with people who knew me. The word derailing is frequently abused in order to silence actual real victims of sexual harassment and assault who happen to be male. And since its really easy to tell the difference between actual derailing and a call for inclusiveness there is no excuse for this.But yes youre right this does happen a lot on Reddit and its shitty both for what it does to womens conversations as well as making it nearly impossible for a male victim to open up about his experiences without being accused of derailing by the very people who claim to be on his side. That is so horrible and I really hope this place can be a refuge from both sides of that.

6376950,0,t1_czegcgn,gt The concept of having a person essentially homemaking is relatively recent and something only rich people could afford. Before the s and the industrial revolution everybody was farming. Yes even women. Nobody had time to do just cooking so they did  hours days mostly outside in the nonwinter and indoor stuff in winter.I dont think this is true to an extent at all though this is heavily tinted by the fact that I recently watched Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice  It is fairly obvious to me that the various servants these women had would have been homemakers.  Indeed even the insults slung at the mother in Pride and Prejudice for the family supposedly doing some housework demonstrates that the concept of homemaking did to some degree exist.  Assuming these films are based heavily on the original works of Jane Austen and assuming Jane Austens accounts are a reliable marker of wealthy women of the period both of which I am assuming.

6538935,0,t3_4552up,Id say thats definitely something Ive experienced during puberty. Testosterone it seems is a hell of a drug whether you take it voluntarily or not. I cant speak for all of us but for me part of becoming a man was leaning to make aggression into a productive force rather than a destructive one. Aggression when properly harnessed can get you through a lot of mental and physical obstacles. Fear pain despair fatigue all these things aggression can overcome. Now sometimes things need to be felt and processed and not simply pushed aside and then aggression becomes a barrier of its own kind. Problems arise when aggression is your only response to stress therein lies toxic masculinity. However I think concepts like toxic masculinity make us too wary of aggression. Fear of being toxically masculine should not make you afraid to be masculine plain and simple whatever masculine means to you. Aggression is not something to be feared but it must be controlled and to be controlled it must be understood and fear is a barrier to understanding. So for me and Im sure for others pubescent surges of hormones were a lesson in self control. When your body forcefully subjects you to surges of aggressive energy strength and control swap places. Proper control is knowing when you need to go all out and true strength is knowing when to hold back.  I do not forgo aggression. Aggression gives you strength but strength without discipline is a liability.The only tip I think I can give is that rather than trying to resist aggression try to just experience it. In fact this is a great tip for dealing with any strong emotion. Instead of focusing on the cause of the feeling focus on the feeling itself. Feel your heart race your nostrils flare your jaw clench your shoulders square up. Breathe deeply and let the feeling wash over you and quickly you enter a profoundly empowered state. You feel as if you can do anything or nothing with equal ease. You are not relaxed but you are in control and control is powerful. TLDR Take a few deep breaths.,MensLib,czvogj0,4,t5_38jid

7618312,0,t1_d384gf1,gtThe only problem I see in that analysis is that Mens Lib seems to consider gender roles as the biggest issue men are facing. I think having legal inequality in terms of family court and criminal sentencing are rights infringements that still exist in this country.What do you think the root cause of legal discrimination against men is? I find this comment to be kind of oblivious. Its also a little ironic because this is actually a classic antifeminist mistake and a good example of why mens rights movements that dont focus on gender roles have been unsuccessful. Youre treating the pressure to conform to the male gender role as if its just another mens issue and ignoring what I think is a pretty reasonable assumption which is that the pressure to conform to gender roles and the default assumption that people do conform to gender roles is one of the major root causes of legal discrimination against men. Given this one could argue that your comment is akin to suggesting that we should spend less time focusing on the heart of these issues and more time on bandaid solutions. I dont think thats quite fair because bandaid solutions are actually important to people in the short term. Thats why weve done things like raise money for organizations that help homeless people and write to American congresspeople about legislation affecting gay men.  But the situation is far more complicated than youre making it out to be. And besides we do talk about practical solutions to these issues. Your characterization of our sub as just talking about gender roles at the expense of real world fixes is simply not based in reality.

9097483,0,t1_d85bpd8,gtDisincentive to report is an issue for crime statistics based on police reports. It is irrelevant to anonymous victimisation surveys.The disincentive goes way deeper than that. Youre assuming people are aware of their victimization. If you know anything about domestic abuse of any kind then youd know that one of the biggest hurdles is the victim realizing that theyre a victim of abuse. What do you say to a man who doesnt think its violence if he gets slapped or doesnt think its rape. Often the survey questions themselves are skewed this way because the bias is so wide spread. The fanatic who came up with the  in  women will be raped herself phrased the equivalent in men as men who are ambiguous about wanting sex. Its insane how onesided society is about all this. gtI already did. Where? Show me. gtWhen I point out other data that conflicts with your theory you ignore it. The only data you pointed to is that violence is present in all societies and I didnt ignore it. Twice I had to explain to you why that is fallacious. Nr Just because we havent solved an issue doesnt mean we dont want it solved. You offered nothing else except name calling. Show me what Ive ignored or stop accusing me of ignoring your points.gtAs opposed to what? You claimed the reason for a reduction in violence is because this generation is just better at controlling their instincts. When you make an absurd claim like that you need evidence and what else could it be? doesnt cut it. gtWhat would count as evidence for or against whatever it is?The fact that you dont even know that tells me it was really just a guess. So that means were back at my initial question Do you think youre averse to violence because its part of being human or because youre just better than others? gtAs I explained earlier if you think this needs explaining you are confused about the difference between victimisation surveys and data based on police reports.No thats a different point entirely. Here were talking about your claim that because its male on male violence therefore the disincentive doesnt matter. That needs some explaining. gtYou have to show that a fact has some relevance to your argument before I can meaningfully respond to it.Fair enough. The more wealthypowerfulhighstatus you are the more freedom you have to do what you want and the safer you are from negative consequences. Hell you could probably find people willing to take a beating for cash. So clearly the more free people are to get and do what they want the less they choose violence. Hence its not something they inherently tend to. Again Violence is the language of the helpless. gtJust to remind you we are disagreeing over whether the primary focus on male representation in prison should be on decreasing the rate at which men commit crime my view or on decreasing the rate at which men are imprisoned for the crimes they commit.We arent. I already told you this is not about how to solve the problem. Its about identifying the causes correctly. Incidentally I think neither of those should be our primary focus. That should be fixing the conditions that lead to violence. The biggest one being poverty and marginalization. But for that to happen we need to get past the crowd that like you just cannot bring itself to see men are disproportionately negatively affected in any significant way. Its all just male privilege and if we just helped women the other problems would just go away. Can I also just add that just look at how much time youve spent arguing with me on both threads and without fail you argue for a position of men arent doing so bad. Given the sub were on its extraordinary to do that. It should really make you stop and think. The disproportionate amount of effort just to correct my supposed exaggerations of the problems.

9535252,0,t1_d9njppz,In response to this bit from the articlegtMen havent gained nearly as much flexibility. The world has changed around them but many have stayed stuck in the past. While women have steadily made their way into traditionally male domains men have not crossed the other way. Men do more at home than they used to but women still do much more  on an average day  percent of men do some housework compared with  percent of women. Male identity remains tied up in dominance and earning potential and when those things flag it seems men either give up or get angry.I find this a super un empathetic version of this bit from a book I came across a while agogtKathryn Edins research in lowincome communities shows for instance that most working women whose partner stayed home to watch the kidswhile very happy with the quality of child care their childrens father providedwere dissatisfied with the relationship overall. These relationships were often filled with conflict Edin told me. Even today she says mens identities are far more defined by their work than womens and both men and women become extremely uncomfortable when mens work goes away Peck p. my emphasis.   The op bit is phrased in an intelligent way so as to sort of blame men for not straying from traditional roles when I am not so sure that guys are driving this. There is another article I remember from a more middle class perspective about rich women and their troubles with dating down the income scale. gtThe discomfort over who pays for what seems to be not really about money plain and simple. Instead it is suggestive of the complex psychology of what many of these women expect from their dates for him to be a traditional breadwinner and what they think they should expect Oh I just want him to be a nice guy...a survey of college women to see if upon graduation they would prefer to settle down with a high school teacher who has short workdays summers off and spare energy to help raise children or with a surgeon who earns eight times as much but works brutal hours. Threequarters of the women said they would choose the teacher...Talk about the subject with women a bit older  those who have been out of college long enough to be more hardened  and what you hear is ambivalence if not downright hostility about the income disparity.I think that one of the reasons that professional feminists havent addressed this apart from in a hand wavy way is that maybe the interests of various women and the need to have a sort of nationalist collective identity andor an enemy to unite often contradict the cause of gender equality.,MensLib,d9of381,22,t5_38jid

Still most of the writers on those shows are probably fathers themselves and theyre always portrayed as loving and wellmeaning even if they have flaws. Someone you really like and respect can take a light hearted ribbing. On the other hand I completely empathise with men who want to take a more actively role in parenting and its holding them back. This trope is so pervasive that its almost become a kind of received wisdom and hearing jokes at your expense when youre just trying to be a parent must be infuriating after a while. I guess this is particularly the case if youre the only stay at home dad with a group of mums.

I call her the allconquering female. Almost without exception she is underestimated by men and then proves herself more intelligent cleverer more courageous and more skilled than any man. Whether were talking about a romantic comedy an officedrama or an adventure movie the allconquering female will almost inevitably show up. And she has to show her worth in a domineering way that is to say over and against the men. For her to appear strong they have to appear weak. For a particularly good case in point watch the most recent Star Wars film.gtNow I perfectly understand the legitimacy of feminist concerns regarding the portrayal of women in the media as consistently demure retiring and subservient to men. I grant that in most of the actionadventure movies that I saw growing up women would typically twist an ankle or get captured and then require rescuing by the swashbuckling male heroand I realize how galling this must have been to generations of women. And therefore a certain correction was undoubtedly in order. But what is problematic now is the Nietzschean quality of the reaction by which I mean the insistence that female power has to be asserted over and against males that there is an eitheror zerosum conflict between men and women. It is not enough in a word to show women as intelligent savvy and good you have to portray men as stupid witless and irresponsible.

10040995,0,t1_dbf5uph,Thats a pretty interesting study though it proves only a correlation not necessarily that it is caused by a double standard. The fact that other types of studies fail to find a persisting double standard suggests the reasons for this dynamic may be more complicated than a simple double standard.Also the study only measured likes but not dislikes so its possible that it missed a separate set of people who dislike promiscuous boys.Another thing that leaps out at me from this study is gender of evaluatorgt permissive boys are more likely to gain status from female peers than from male peers while permissive girls only have lower peer acceptance among other girls. These results suggest that female reactions to sexual behavior simultaneously escalate the status of permissive boys and decrease the status of permissive girls.This seems to totally contradict the feminist assumption that the double standard is caused by male power. Going by this study if boys approval were all that mattered in society it wouldnt matter much whether you were promiscuous or not. Or maybe feminists have succeeded in changing the attitudes of boys but failed to change the attitudes of girls?According to Google Ngrams cad was about as common as slut from  is more common than slut from  and is still around half as common as slut I suspect the recent rise in slut is due to feminist books using the term to criticize it. So if slut is a significant shaming of female promiscuity then cad is a significant shaming of male promiscuity. Definitions of Casanova vary but sometimes include negative connotations and Casanova has stayed more common than slut since  Likewise libertine was more common than slut from  Most strikingly of all pervert which usually refers to a mans sexuality is still more common than slut and the further back you go the more common it was.I think stud has too many definitions to meaningfully compare. It is more common than slut but so are rake and creep negative terms about male sexuality that also have too many definitions to compare. Anecdotally though I dont think ever heard anyone use the word stud outside of s porn and feminist criticism of the term.BTW I live in Australia where media and governments constantly stereotype abusers as male so I think it counts as a feminist area.,MensLib,dbgd92l,2,t5_38jid
10053769,0,t3_5jkkx7,I scanned the link but was unable to find how  or even if  they established which way the causal arrow pointed. That is do exaggerated masculine norms worsen mens mental health? Or are men who are vulnerable to mental health issues more likely to embrace exaggerated masculine norms?Its a critical question and assuming the causal arrow only or predominantly points in the way indicated by the posts headline appears to me to be more of an ideological conclusion rather than a scientific one  unless Ive overlooked something that someone can point out to me.As it stands the argument appears to me to be framed very similarly to the way conservatives and traditionalists misuse correlation to argue against divorce. For example they point to studies showing that children from broken families dont fare as well as children from families that dont divorce  totally ignoring that the set of people who divorce is more likely to include a significant number of people who are just bad at relationships and that children of such parents would probably face rougher sledding regardless of whether their parents separated or remained in a dysfunctional marriage.Now I agree there are toxic aspects to traditional masculinity and its certainly plausible that adopting that approach to life inherently leads to problems particularly in a society which has supposedly evolved beyond the need for that approach.But I can also see other explanations for the correlation. For example I think it likely that men growing up in impoverished and crimeridden neighborhoods would both a be more vulnerable to having psychological issues and b be more likely to embrace exaggerated masculine norms in order to deal with a violent male hierarchy where being seen as vulnerable could make a man subject to disrespect and violent victimization. In such a situation it would be completely inaccurate to claim that a mans embrace of exaggerated masculine norms caused his psychological issues.,MensLib,dbi14cz,33,t5_38jid

Creating our own discussions gaining our own attention will communicate what we truly want to say FGM is more harmful than male circumcision but male circumcision of children with no serious medical grounds is bad.I would agree to the general idea that Male circumcision is bad because of the act itself but it is absurd to not compare them at all when their basic ideologies are fairly similar. Although I do understand the tendency that people who want to discredit anything related to feminism have of throwing out male issues to invalidate anything that is said. I think there is another problem with the argument...gt FGM is more harmful and dangerous than circumcision of the penis and it takes place for different reasons. Therefore it makes sense for antiFGM campaigns to run separately from campaigns against male circumcision. We will do no good for either cause by hijacking FGM discussions with What about boys? This distracts from the FGM message which in turn creates tension which distracts from our own message.Which is that when I read this argument I am always curious how they feel about Germain Greers argument about the paternalistic rhetoric behind it.

Im from a writinglit studiescultural studies background so a lot will focus on the language used.Is it statedimplied that the only reason we should help men is because it would make them useful for society not because theyre human beings? In other words reinforcing the idea that men are only to be valued for what they can do for others  treating men like broken tools that are costing the company money not people with problems.Note phrases like men not participating help men contribute falling behind academically etc. especially in relation to working. EDIT This one reinforces the ideal that the only point to a man is to serve others and to fail to do so  and to dare want to focus on oneself  is the gravest flaw of all. That failure to sacrifice is one of the worse things men can do. It objectifies men through their labour. Is it statedimplied that while men have issues these issues arent as serious as others issues? Does the article feel the need to constantly defer to others problems and minimise mens by comparison  even if it makes no sense within wider the context of the article? Is it impliedsaid that we shouldnt worry about these problems until all other problems are dealt with?

Be especially wary if an article supposedly about mens spends the majority its words talking about others issues. EDIT Think Birkenhead Drill applied to...everywhere outside of a sinking ship. Look for lots of stats that show who else has it worse This affects  of men but compared to it affecting  of others... and immediate neutralisation of mens issues when theyre mentioned  This is one of the biggest problems facing men although its not as a bad for men as it is for....Is the language used to described mens issues uncertain or indefinite?

Figured this one would do better on its own Does the article focus on more on the concept that men may have issues whoa! rather than the issues themselves?Is the article not on mens issues so much as its about men who have issues? Rather than highlighting the specific problems men are mentioning does it merely just talk about how men are complaining?You wouldnt think a man who owns two houses earns over six figures a year... Yet Bobs not alone more and more men are...Does the article insist that the existence of mens problems is dependent on research...research that doesnt exist? Does it deride personal experiences from actual men? Does it insist that mens subjective experiences can only be validated with objective research from third parties? This sort of research is notoriously thin on the ground. Think of phrases like Theres no evidence... or interviews with people in positions of power who deride or dismiss complaints. EDIT I realise this seems odd and might make it look like Im deriding any sort of scientific or academic research but its quite the opposite  its pointing out that god look I know Im quoting Rummy here that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Theres a lack of research done into mens issues and its used as a proof that any issues exist. Theres no research to back this up... Research suggests otherwise...Note this is similar to the Derisive point listed in OPs post but is a bit more...weaselly Are mens issues treated as a source of humour with jokes or in any way nonseriously?Cracking jokes use of sarcasm implying that its funny that men have issues. Turns out men are becoming less manly! Men have problems? Aww weve been focusing so much on womens problems turns out that poor men are feeling left out!Are the mens problems in the article actually only universal problems that  surprise!  actually affect everyone? In other words does it imply that men shouldnt be allowed to have their own problems or that its only worth fixing mens problems if it helps others along the way.We need to allow men to do X because then it would make it more acceptable for others to do X... This problem affects more than just men...Finally and perhaps most importantly does it just flatout deride men as whingers complainers wusses?Surprisingly this still happens.AddendumAre does the article seek to reinvent these problems as privilege?Does it suggest that if men had a different view of things everything would be ok and their problems would actually be benefits?This paints men as whiny and spoiled Working  hours a week allows men to outearn everyone else and be independent Being denied personal leave is often actually a sign that youre a valuable team member Men mightnt get compliments on their appearance but it beats being treated like a piece of meat You may want to spend more time with your kids but be grateful youre not the one changing nappies...,MensLib,dd4njxh,3,t5_38jid

Exposure in the womb masculinises the brain  giving it certain properties including sexual identity as a male as well as a preference for play patterns that involve physical contact and even play fights. We know this because girls exposed to abnormal levels of testosterone during this time show similar behaviour but much less otherwise. At puberty there is another surge of testosterone acting on this alreadyprepared brain this not only awakens sexuality but encourages various strategies for competing for a mate  including the use of aggression and risktaking behaviour.

Such ideas help noone.I used to think like this but nowadays Ive come round to thinking that it is better to know what seemingly ugly things humans are extremely prone to and it is better to take account of these to try to avoid situations where they come out into the open. ,MensLib,ddmrm8l,1,t5_38jid
10734862,0,t1_ddmrm8l,Resources are a very subjective thing and evolution doesnt work based on vague descriptive words. If you are basing your argument on something that changes from culture to culture or doesnt even exist in many others then your argument doesnt work. You cant evolve to prefer a performative aspect that is never constant. If you gotta think in terms of how rich the male is and what your society considers rich for some attraction to form thats not innate. At this point the only thing in common these things have is that you assigned a word to them chosen specifically so you can fit the current cultural stereotype into them and argue its biological but now youre clearly talking about culture. Innate drives dont think.I also really disagree with using powerful men and harems as some measure of what women find attractive. Just because being in a harem was the best thing a woman could do for her comfort doesnt make that decision motivated by sexual attraction just as serving in a kings army wasnt motivated by any special loyalty towards the king. Marriage has historically been less about attraction and more about practicality for both men and women. Far as I know most human malefemale partnerships were in pairs the for life aspect was less common and considering the vast majority of males werent powerful there isnt really much point in there being an innate attraction to power rather than other factors such as confidence which I would say is innately attractive to women.gtI used to think like this but nowadays Ive come round to thinking that it is better to know what seemingly ugly things humans are extremely prone to and it is better to take account of these to try to avoid situations where they come out into the open.I dont know how many sexists or heck just regular men you come across but I envy you if you dont hear biological explanations used to excuse not understand shitty behavior. This is why I very specifically said there is no point in justifying bad behavior. Men cant help it but sexually assault women men cant help it but disrespect women men cant help it but to be violent men cant help being inconsiderate towards everyone else. It is not used to try and combat this behavior it is used to excuse it to say welp we cant help it youre just gonna have to deal with us making the world a shittier place. And yet instances of violence and crime have been dropping over the last decades so men have been changing for the better.,MensLib,ddn7y3n,7,t5_38jid

11138380,0,t1_derakat,OK then let me try to be helpful.Republicans have for a very long time tried to criminalize GLBT blacks women nonchristians and many other groups of people. There is still a significant presence of white nationalists neoNazis and KKK with in the Republican Party. The vast majority of climate denialists and evolution denialists reside within the Republican Party. The Republican Party spawned the Tea Party which is considered one of the most radicalized political groups in America.  The vast overwhelming majority of religious extremists in this country or Republican or Republican adjacent. Hate preachers are pretty much exclusively Republican. The vast overwhelming majority of domestic terrorism in America is carried out by people who identify as Republican or conservative. The most common forms of domestic terrorism in America are targeting abortion clinics Planned Parenthoods and institutions that provide care for womens reproductive rights. Republican Congress people frequently come out on the record and say things like rape really isnt so bad poor people are like animals black people are lazy gay people are in abomination against God and crap like that.On the left we have a small but loud group of vocal SJWs. They dont form hate groups they dont blow up abortion clinics they dont advocate for the systematic genocide or criminalization of groups of people based on their gender race sexual orientation or religion. The worst thing they really do is run their mouths. The Democrats as a party tries so hard to stay near the middle because they think thats what theyre supposed to do. Historically Democrats run on a very far left liberal platform but then once they get in office they run to the center  Obama and Bill Clinton were known for this.

It doesnt even need to start with something big or discrete e.g. a sickness or injury but rather just plain stress.  Stress can lead to illness or impair injury recovery but without time off to heal fully a little health problem can become a chronic one which can lead to being laid off or moved to lowerpaying work which reduces access to nutritious food which predisposes to more health issues and so on and so forth.IMHO the social safety net is most accurately understood not as charity or the pejorative handouts but as a way to stopping positive feedback loops before they lead to disaster.  ,MensLib,dfa4dx4,5,t5_38jid

11288866,0,t1_dfbiv4c,gtThats a good question. Personally I think shame is appropriate in situations where someone is behaving in a way that causes immediate severe harm which is a subjective measure. I think its usually a bandaid. For example if someone is perpetrating domestic violence against their significant other I think its reasonable for that persons friends to shun them which I see as a form of change. However the long term solutions to domestic violence have to include cultural changes education etc. Sure its like how some counties give people different colored license plates if they get caught driving drunk.But shame can be useful for less drastic things too.Id say too much shame is bad like when it debilitates someone.gtCan you elaborate on this? I see compassion as a trait more associated with traditional femininity than masculinity. Thats not to say women are more compassionate than men just that they seem to be pressured into compassion more than men are.Look at the most well known compassionate people theyre all men. Mother Theresa is the only routinely cited female example of compassion and shes really a complex story.No by far and large men are the ones with compassion. Not that plenty of men have next to zero too.Women tend to give their sympathies and pity more so than compassion itself. But perhaps I digress too much.gtAs for your example I think its a bit inconsistent. You saygtgtgtone of the guys says he doesnt want to go downtown because its so coldgtgtbut then you say going out wit his friends is what he actually wants to do. gtgtI think what youre getting at is that emotional resilience makes peoples lives easier and gives them the ability to delay gratification and suffer for a bit for something that will make them happier over all. I agree with you but I think youre making a fundamental assumption here that may not be true. Yup exactly more resilience benefits most people.gtgtHis guy friends will probably make fun of him in hopes that he toughens up which ultimately benefits that person.gtgtYoure stating as fact that his friends making fun of him will ultimately benefit him presumably my toughening him up? Im not convinced of this at all. You might be right but I think its totally possible that his friends making fun of him will only serve to put him between a rock and a hard place. If he chooses to go out in the cold because of his friends jeering its not necessarily because hes tougher. It might be because hes decided that enduring the cold is better than enduring shame. I dont really see putting him in that position as helping him.  The idea would be that repeatedly enduring the cold would be what toughens him up the shame is just the catalyst to get the ball rolling.But you are correct that it puts him between a rock and a hard place.

I found it particularly offputting at the way the speaker pushed the equation of raising your voice  yelling  verbal abuse. He simply presumed that the writers version of events was wrong and that the womans version of events was correct. Indeed the speaker seemed to be saying that all men who experienced what the writer was talking about were wrong and that all women are always being justified in their complaints about male behavior in this situation. It seems that this conclusion is based entirely on the speakers sexist view of woman amp man in conflict must mean the woman is right and the man is wrong.Without a videotape of the man and woman in question it would be impossible to know for sure whether the writer was being reasonably accurate or outrageously offbase and biased. Either is possible. I think we should extend the presumption of good faith to the writer but with a measure of skepticism as we should with anyone we dont know.gt Ill add something from my personal experience to this too I notice that even when my tone and volume havent changed the yelling accusation gets lobbed out when the other person is logically backed into a corner and facing the realization that their views have been proven wrong in conversations where such proof is indeed possible such as various crackpot ideas like creationism or antivax.Ive seen it used similarly.I think there is such a thing as verbal abuse and yelling can be a form of verbal abuse but I also think that people  particularly intimates  can get into fights and yelling at each other is a pretty common consequence and it doesnt equate to abuse. Whether or not yelling is abusive depends on a great deal of context. As a therapist once told me You make a mess but you clean it up afterwards.All in all I thought the video was sexist and bordered on being toxic particularly when the speaker said things like Were the ones that should have to listen to what women have to say not the other way around.
