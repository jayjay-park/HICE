4507878,0,t1_csyv66e,yeah thats one thing I hate about some series. Spice and wolf did the same thing Hell except with SampW theyre still putting out manga except there hasnt been a new season yet and we all know it deserves a third season. Its like Spice and wolf  is half life . You know its coming.  Except it will never get here in our lifetime. ,waifuwars,csyv907,1,t5_38afq
