95100,0,t3_1v6ht6,Possibly caused by an underice volcanogtIn January  the British Antarctic Survey BAS scientists Hugh Corr and David Vaughan reported that  years ago a volcano erupted under the Antarctic ice sheet. This was the biggest Antarctic eruption in the last  years. The volcano is situated in the Hudson Mountains close to Pine Island Glacier. The eruption spread a layer of volcanic ash or tephra over the surface of the ice sheet. This ash was then buried under the snow and ice. Corr and Vaughan were able to map this ash layer using an airborne radar system and calculate the date of the eruption from the depth of burial of the ash. This method uses dates calculated from nearby ice cores. The presence of the volcano raises the possibility that volcanic activity could have contributed or may contribute in the future to increases in the flow of the glacier.,environment,cep99qo,0,t5_2qh1n

And not enough US citizens are informed enough or care enough to do anything.  Where am I going with this?  Well Im trying to conclude that re engineering everything all at once is merely wishful thinking.  So I think OP has a point.In my view we need to try to get the word out about specifically WHAT in these procedures is directly harming the environment.  If people and companies become aware of how to improve their procedures cheaply quickly and effectively we could make some progress.  ...that being said of COURSE renewable is better.

The conversation will be transparent involving everyone affected by the spill the company that caused it policymakers who were behind the decision to frack in the first place and will allow for solutions involving all the stakeholders to be created. I think its really important that we have a space like this so that we have a way of properly dealing with things like this chemical spill otherwise were just going to be stuck in the same old way of doing things which isnt really achieving much.

I dont know what you dont understand about the facts that have been displayed in articles from Bill Moyers the IPCC the Global Oceans Commission and so forth. Its not like their modeling anymore its not like we need to predict anymore when youre watching it live on tv in HD. Maybe you think this is an exaggeration and thats fine its your right to be putting your head in the sand I wont stop you. But the facts you speak about you just dont bring anything to the table for us to look at.. Im not teaching soccer and I would like to think the audience here is not a little kid but perhaps they get it....more than you know. Small incremental changes are fine but our society is not about to change anytime soon by being soothed like an infant and coddled. I have my POV based on what Ive read and what I see and having been around the planet...a lot. So its changing and its changing very fast. All the models are being revised and all the predictions are decades sooner than estimates just a decade ago. . Methane comes up often enough and its a problem for sure the reason CO is focused on in my opinion is because a it breaks down in  years and CO takes thousands of years and b CO in the atmosphere is the reason the methane is bubbling out of the permafrost not the other way around. So how exactly do you plan on mitigating that? kilometer wide bubbling methane gas....whats your plan? I also agree that the fracking is a disaster unregulated and top secret special ingredients...NG could be a transition fuel from oil and coal since it puts out about  the CO that coal does.

The factory farming causes increased populations of cows and other live stock.  We have a few billion cows on this planet and it is because humans have decided they are a source of our energy and food. By cutting our animal product consumption we can mitigate environmental footprints.  Cowspiracy is a great movie coming out that educates about the environmental harms of our farming practices. No to mention the gasoline used to transport food to the animals that the animals then eat until they are fat enough to be killed for food.

1477181,0,t1_cj1f2jx,I didnt need one for some reason so Ill post it.Fridays announcement is the first real step toward what could be a transformation in coastal states creating thousands of jobs to support a new energy infrastructure. But it dismayed environmentalists and people who owe their livelihoods to fisheries and tourism.The cannons create noise pollution in waters shared by whales dolphins and turtles sending sound waves many times louder than a jet engine reverberating through the deep every ten seconds for weeks at a time. Arguing that endangered species could be harmed was the environmental groups best hope for extending a decadesold ban against drilling off the U.S. Atlantic coast.The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management acknowledged that thousands of sea creatures will be harmed even as it approved opening the outer continental shelf from Delaware to Florida to exploration. Energy companies need the data as they prepare to apply for drilling leases in  when current congressional limits expire.The bureaus decision reflects a carefully analyzed and balanced approach that will allow us to increase our understanding of potential offshore resources while protecting the human marine and coastal environments acting BOEM Director Walter Cruickshank said in a statement.Sonic cannons are already used in the western Gulf of Mexico off Alaska and in other offshore oil operations around the world. They are towed behind boats sending down pulses of sound that reverberate beneath the sea floor and rebound to the surface. Hydrophones capture the results which computers translate into high resolution threedimensional images.Its like a sonogram of the Earth said Andy Radford a petroleum engineer at the American Petroleum Institute an oil and gas trade association in Washington DC. You cant see the oil and gas but you can see the structures in the Earth that might hold oil and gas.The surveys also can map marine habitats and identify solid undersea flooring for wind energy turbines. But fossil fuel mostly funds this research and corporations keep the data secret disclosing it only to the government.They paid for it so I can see why they dont want to share. These things are not cheap said John Jaeger a University of Florida geology professor.Oil lobbyists say drilling for the estimated . billion barrels of recoverable oil and . trillion cubic feet of natural gas that lies beneath federal waters from Florida to Maine could generate  billion in investment and spending between  and  contributing . billion per year to the economy.These estimates describe the total amount of energy technically recoverable from the nations outer continental shelf but the Atlantic seabed from New Jersey through New England remains off limits for now. While some states have passed drilling bans Virginia and the Carolinas asked for the surveys bureau officials explained Friday.I honestly feel we can go offshore and harvest the energy thats out there said South Carolina state Sen Paul Campbell. I think were kind of foolish not to.In any case the area to be mapped is farther offshore in federal waters beyond the reach of state law.The sonic cannons are often fired continually for weeks or months and multiple mapping projects may operate simultaneously. To get permits companies will need to have whalespotting observers onboard and do undersea acoustic tests to avoid nearby species. Certain habitats will be closed during birthing or feeding seasons.Still underwater microphones have picked up blasts from these sonic cannons over distances of thousands of miles and the constant banging  amplified in water by orders of magnitude  will be impossible for many species to avoid.Whales and dolphins depend on being able to hear their own much less powerful echolocation to feed communicate and keep in touch with their family groups across hundreds of miles. Even fish and crabs navigate and communicate by sound said Grant Gilmore an expert on fish ecology in Vero Beach Fla.We dont know what the physiological effects are. It could be permanent hearing damage in many of these creatures just by one encounter with a highenergy signal Gilmore said.More than  comments were sent to the government which spent years developing these rules. The bureaus environmental impact study estimates that more than  sea creatures could be harmed including nine of the worlds remaining  north Atlantic right whales.These whales give birth and breed off the coast of Florida Georgia and the Carolinas.Once they cant hear  and thats the risk that comes with seismic testing  they are pretty much done for said Katie Zimmerman a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League based in Charleston S.C.Even if there were oil out there do we really want that? Do we really want to see these offshore rigs set up? she asked.By federal law scientists cant approach marine mammals without following careful protocols and yet this decision will pervade their environment with noise pollution that could have a longterm impact on their population said Scott Kraus a right whale expert at the John H. Prescott Marine Laboratory in Boston.No one has been allowed to test anything like this on right whales Kraus said. The Obama administration has authorized a giant experiment on right whales that this country would never allow researchers to do.Some exploratory wells were drilled before the U.S. Atlantic seabed was closed to exploration in the s but they never produced much. The latest seismic technology should change that.One thing we find is the more you get out and drill and explore to confirm what you see in the seismic  you end up finding more oil and gas than what you think is out there when you started Radford said.More than  communities from Florida to New Jersey passed resolutions opposing or raising concerns about seismic testing and offshore drilling. In north Floridas St. Augustine Beach tourism and fishing fuel the economy and rare turtles come ashore to lay eggs.Florida has already felt the devastating effects of an uncontrolled oil release with the Deepwater Horizon event of which cleanup efforts are still ongoing said John Morris a county commissioner whose constituency includes the beach town. Any oil spill large or small off the coast of St. Johns County would greatly affect the countys economy.,environment,cj1fv7o,7,t5_2qh1n

When they went out into the ocean to see if that held true in reallife they found that the addition of the sun acidification actually killed them faster.The experiment you mentioned rapidly put bacteria in an environment we would expect s of years from now. It is amazing that it only stunted growth. If he were to leave them in these conditions for several years they would adapt. Over a  year period the phytoplankton would adapt. Smaller experiments have shown a positive result and indeed I see the result of this experiment as a positive result as well.gtbut were changing the environment MUCH faster than life can evolve.Sure but we are talking specifically about the bacteria here which can evolve and respond to strenuous conditions within a year. Imagining that bacteria not responding to slowly changing conditions over a  year period is rather ridiculous. Probably why the scientist in the article you linked added his disclaimergtAlso note Clouds increase Albedo reflectivity but not water vapor itself . Water vapor has a positive RF factor which means that more of it traps frequencies of light that warm the planet. But wait! Theres more about Albedo! You know whats really good at reflecting sun high albedo? Ice.Yes I never disagreed with this... I even made a bold disclaimergtIm not saying hotter temperatures which would cause the increase in water vapor isnt a bad thingMy point was that the only studies that Ive seen only increase water vapor locally with a residence of only  days. Moreover I have yet to see a study which mentions cloud cover and albedo appropriately primarily they only focus on reflecting downward not out.gtYeah? Well where did you get that opinion? Citation? Science and making good opinions must be based on evidence. The experimental evidence that in the last two years were seeing methane released due to warming and were getting a feedback loop.I learned this in middle school and Im getting my Masters degree related to it now.... But lets ignore that for the moment. How do you believe that carbon gets redeposited back into the ground. List the processes.gtA measurement is a measurement is a measurement.gtIf we measure RF values we have a number. If we measure solar incidence we have a number and all of those numbers are easily duplicated and retested and agreed upon with very small error bars.gtAlbedo can be measured from any space satellite with a camera. All of these values are Ill say it again easy to measure.gtNow the only question is what model to you plug these values into and the entire scientific community that uses Albedo RF factors Solar Incidence and many other solid experimentally verified data are getting values are are pretty close and highly predictive because its using physics thats been understood for over  years.The very article you linked disagrees with you. Not only are the oceans big covering  percent of the planet they are complex ....That makes global predictions of the impacts of ocean acidification a big challenge. Moreover abedo constantly changes on earth as well as all the other variables. They are hard to measure and there is no equation that takes into account all the variables appropriately.All attempts to do this accurately have failed over and over again.

I pointed out that if that argument was relevant than it would also mean that killing a human would result in less deaths than not killing one so if youre so concerned with overall animal health it would make more sense to kill yourself. Its an obvious extension of the premise but youre so stupid you cant make any association of concepts. Im not equating anything other than the number of saved animals. Killing a human isnt the same. But the concept that you would save even more animals if you killed yourself instead of a wolf is a fact. And if you look back to my initial comment I suggested you kill yourself not someone else. So that wouldnt make you a sociopath at all. Just doing your part to protect all the animals because youre so concerned for their well being. ,environment,cln3vqq,1,t5_2qh1n

2833350,0,t1_cnq0ss5,Im not decrying strict regulation. What I am decrying is inappropriate regulation.The NRC has a set of regulations in place that are designed entirely around the only approved type of reactor in the US  the uraniumbased light water moderated reactor. This is because back in the s Admiral Rickover effectively forced the US nuclear industry to standardize on light water reactors since thats what the Navy used. Any alternative reactors designs and alternative fuels no matter how conceptually safe the designs may have been were sidelined.Its very similar to the current state of fusion research. All effort went into tokamak designs and ITER now consumes the lions share of US fusion research funding  despite the fact that ITER will never produce commercially usable power by design.All you have to do is look at the roadblocks that Transatomic Power has been facing in trying to get their reactor licensed. They are building on work done by ORNL with the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Theyve designed a modular passivelysafe reactor that can be built in a factory and shipped to the installation site  unlike the current reactors that are built in pieces and constructed on site. But they cannot even get NRC approval to build a prototype because their design doesnt fit into the light water pigeonhole the NRC assumes all reactors must follow.Fortunately they just announced a deal with ORNL that will work toward making the engineering blueprints for the reactor  but I still have no idea how theyre going to get a prototype built and tested with the NRC in the way.

I dont care aboutgt economic losses for fossil fuel companies. The less money we givegt them the better.Actually you do under any pretense of a fair and just economic or social system.  To do otherwise is simple theft even if the well and such are nationalized.  One also presumes youd do this worldwide correct?gt From the same Wikipedia article it says that globally fossil fuel subsidies are  billion dollars while renewable subsidies are  billion dollars. As you can see theres half a trillion dollars that can go to renewable energy. Thats a lot of money.Firstly theyre counting everything equipment writeoffs depreciation etc. as subsidies....thats not quite fair.  Secondly while Id prefer that no company of any type get subsidies if were going to extend additional subsidies to solar companies Id be okay with that.  Where do they come from though?gt The tax should be minimal at the beginning but it should increase gt rapidly with time. Fossil fuels should cost  times more in a mattergt of  years.I assume this is some form of carbon tax?  Where do the monies go?  If we were to do something like this Id prefer the governments of the world stay out of it completely but Im not sure how we keep them from spending it.  Do you have specifics about how this would work?gt I forget to add that it would be a good thing to nationalize fossil gt fuel companies too. It is wrong that profits from wrecking the gt planet go to private citizens. There should be no profits at all ingt producing fossil fuels. People seeking to make easy money shouldgt look somewhere else or better stop looking at all.I think anybody working in the oil or gas industry would laugh at the easy money remark...aint nothing easy about working an oil rig!

Red tides are events in which estuarine marine or fresh water algae accumulate rapidly in the water column resulting in coloration of the surface water. It is usually found in coastal areas. It kills many manatees every year. gtThese algae known as phytoplankton are singlecelled protists plantlike organisms that can form dense visible patches near the waters surface. Certain species of phytoplankton dinoflagellates contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from green to brown to red.gtWhen the algae are present in high concentrations the water appears to be discolored or murky varying in color from purple to almost pink normally being red or green. Not all algal blooms are dense enough to cause water discoloration and not all discolored waters associated with algal blooms are red. Additionally red tides are not typically associated with tidal movement of water hence the preference among scientists to use the term algal bloom.gtgtImage i  A red tide off the coast of La Jolla San Diego California.Interesting Men of War Red Tide | Justin Foley | Chandler Red Tide | Karenia brevis Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcowz oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecowz.

Im not sure about their exact stance on the issue but the ethical practices of corporations which produce GMOs should be held to scrutiny especially because these companies do have some notsogreat histories. And if consumers want to target GMO companies they need to know when they are buying their products.However requiring GMO labelling isnt much of a solution here. Sure a few of the companies might take a decent hit if we started labeling but many have more diversified investments and would keep chugging along. If the aim was actually to stop unethical business and environmental practices a more logical move would be to demand greater transparency in business through legislation.And besides that I have no proof but this is my hunch I would guess that most people against GMOs are thinking about business ethics second and their health first.On the other hand I feel like this statementgtIf the world suddenly decides to shift back to organic farming practices we would have about a  drop in agricultural productivity. Millions of acres of land would have to be brought into production mostly in places like Brazil and billions of people would go hungryDesperately needs a citation. Sure if all world governments decided that starting tomorrow we were all going back to ox and plow agriculture there would be significant problems. But I can only assume that if the world adopted a much more vegetarian diet and put a lot of scientific effort into growing food as efficiently as possible without GMOs we could at least largely mitigate the issue.,environment,colpgk9,6,t5_2qh1n

3198976,0,t1_cothrmi,Alright draw me through the process in which we draw oil from the bitumen sand. I take it you have a very strong understanding of environmental impact assessments on each individual project by each company because they are all the same right? Also Id like to know when they plan on decommissioning all the preexisting extraction plants for this amazing technofix. Its the best and most efficient ways of getting massive amounts of relatively cheap energy. When the fundamental economic principle of the bitumen sand extraction requires high gas prices to make it economically feasible. Can you please explain to me how this super technofix is more efficient then collecting oil that literally springs form the earth in other places? That doesnt require energy in the form of mined extraction and movement and fundamentally requires the use of heat energy in order to extract the oil from the sands. So please explain to me how something that could by definition never be an efficient way of extracting oil from the ground is one of the most efficient methods because of this technofix? I hear there is this fantastic new source of oil that can be extracted from shale rock that is even more efficient than collecting oil that can literally spring from the fucking ground.Alright so the cheap natural gas I speak of comes from where? Since you know so much more than me? And it automatically uses the fracking method? And comes automatically from the provinces? And never from the territories? I wonder what sourgas is and I wonder the environmental impact of using said natural gas to extract oil is. I wonder what the effect of drawing water from rivers that reduce lake levels by feet downstream from the oil sands is. Do we maybe have similar examples of this problem of drawdown of the water? Leveling up energy can you explain this concept to me? Because evolution of energy needs to follow the Maoist style model of technological increases in industrial development of regions? Is this just like how less developed medical technology needs to level up? Before it can be effective? Like do these less developed countries need to go through a Miasma theory of disease spread before they can benefit from vaccines? Should they go through a bloodletting level before the Miasma theory level? So what are these terrible landfill disasters? Id like you to literally look them up and find out what are their causes? Is it the act of venting the gas or is the accumulation of said gases that cant vent out that cause these disasters? I wonder and this is a huge maybe that this process happens naturally almost every day at every moment. I could be misunderstanding the principle of decomposition by bacteria. So you took the time after my post about digesters to look up its effective use in remote and less developed regions who have difficulty with health issues due to nonsmokeless cooking fuels?I wonder what piece of technology already in use that uses this same principle with almost no risk. Is it possibly septic tanks maybe is it water treatment plants and maybe is it the production of alcohol sans distillation? Vinegar? Another thing thats confusing to me can you explain to me the health risks of midden pits? Because I hear that a super safe method of waste disposal. I wonder if there is a simple method to avoid that problem and at the same time produce clean smokeless cooking fuel. What could it be?  Tldr You need to strongly reconsider the fact that you probably dont know what you are talking about. Most importantly about the Oil sands and secondly being skeptical about something that you dont understand that was recommended to you as a solution to the problem of nonsmokeless cooking fuel. ,environment,cotknoc,1,t5_2qh1n

3413346,0,t1_cphbzyf,If youre up for a read PDFFrom the summarygt After general elections are over one of the first orders of business for Senate leaders is setting thesizes and ratios of committees. Although the size of each standing committee is set in Senaterules changes in these sizes often result from interparty negotiations before each new Congress.Senate party leaders also negotiate the party ratios on standing committees. Determinations ofsizes and ratios usually are made before the process of assigning Senators to committees.gt Once sizes and ratios of standing committees are determined a panel for each party nominatescolleagues for committee assignments. Senate Republicans primarily use a Committee onCommittees for this purpose although the Republican leader nominates Senators for assignmentto some standing committees. Senate Democrats use a Steering and Outreach Committee tonominate Democrats for assignment to all standing committees. The processes these panels useare distinct. Republicans rely on a seniority formula to make nominations while Democrats makenominations on a seatbyseat basis considering a variety of factors.gt The processes also have many common features. After the general election each panel solicitspreferences for committee assignment from party colleagues then matches these preferences withvacancies on standing committees. Senate rules along with party rules and practices guide thework of the Committee on Committees and the Steering and Outreach Committee. Senate rulesfor instance divide the standing and other Senate committees into three groups the socalled AB and C categories. Senators must serve on two A committees and may serve on one Bcommittee and any number of C committees. Exceptions to these restrictions are sometimesapproved by the Senate. Both parties place further limitations for example by generallyprohibiting two Senators from the same party and state from serving on the same committee.gt The nominations of each of these panels require the approval of the pertinent full partyconference and ultimately the Senate. Approval at both stages usually is granted easily because ofthe debate and decisionmaking earlier in the process. tldr It sounds like they pick the party ratios for the committees then each party picks who they want on which committees and it all passes no problem.  After all if it didnt pass because one party doesnt want X on a specific committee then the other party could then try to block person Y on another committee and problems ensue.This is also specific to the Senate the House may have their own rules but I imagine theyre probably similar.,environment,cphch3w,11,t5_2qh1n

3500621,0,t1_cpr7uy8,you have completely misrepresented what I said and created multiple straw men. Maybe you should work on your reading comprehension.What I said was that for a lower population to make an impact it would need to drop far more than the few million you mentioned. When the average US citizen is consuming at a level that would need  earths to maintain said consumption a drop of just a few million is not going to make much of a difference.I also was worried about business that refine or transport fossil fuels skipping out on even more regulations and safe guards to make more money. Im think along the lines of something like Deep Horizon becoming more and more common since the fossil fuels industry does such a great job of policing themselves as it is.And it is pretty common knowledge that the so called aging problem as you stupidly refer to it as is a very real thing and will create major problems as the country eventually collapses under it own tax burden similar to the way Detroit has. Just take a quick look on google. Back to my point above imagine a whole country full of things like oil pipelines nuclear and coal power plants that eventually does not have the proper funding to take care of these things.

3719081,0,t1_cqg5l1a,I dont think this is a good example but I can see how others might  however it does disturb me very much that the parallel would be drawn. Ill get to this point later.First let me say that I believe the reason this is killing is news is because the giraffe is an endangered species. I dont see any dead raccoons getting press. The giraffe was considered not important to conservation and so its life was sold to provide for the community  a community that presumably will now work to keep giraffe numbers up in order to continue this practice.In this way I see it as analogous to an animal slaughtered for food or cow whose skin is used as leather clothing. All their deaths provides for the lives of people. This may sound callous and to people who think animals should have the same moral standing as a person it rises to the level of inexcusable injustice. I respect that belief but its not one I share. I dont think animals are sentient. I wonder if the people who agree with you would react with the same anger at an animal killed for food  or worse yet a life wasted by throwing away uneaten meat.Now I do not in any way condone animal torture or senseless death but I dont think this is either. The animal was shot with a bow and it died in circumstances not much different than what is routinely acceptable in hunting cultures around the world. The reason I think the rape example is a bad one is precisely because I dont think animals and humans demand the same moral consideration.,environment,cqg79s4,-2,t5_2qh1n

Natural warming and cooling periods are very lengthy and basically unnoticeable. There are brief periods of warming and cooling such as the Medieval Warm Period which hasnt been proven to have existed outside of Europe and the Little Ice Age but to the best of my knowledge were not in one of those right now.The reason the famous CO graph is called the hockey stick is because thats exactly what it looks likethe levels spike in the th Century.

All plants grow well at this level but as CO levels are raised by  ppm photosynthesis increases proportionately resulting in more sugars and carbohydrates available for plant growth. Any actively growing crop in a tightly clad greenhouse with little or no ventilation can readily reduce the CO level during the day to as low as  ppm. The decrease in photosynthesis when CO level drops from  ppm to  ppm is similar to the increase when the CO levels are raised from  to about  ppm Figure .

These folks certainly didnt care for the welfare of the people on the land. The second example is a contractor for one of the drilling companies who illegally disposed of drilling waste by just dumping it in on the ground in the woods. This saved him the cost of travelling to an approved disposal facility. This was an individual acting on his own as far as we know.Regulations are good but theyre not perfect.

4237692,0,t3_39edsa,I agree there should be a WWII scale mobilization to solve the global warming crisis especially if the Copenhagenrecent G commitment to C was anything other than more hot air. However I do not believe that anyone in the organization sponsoring these events or any of the climate scientists who use the WWII rhetoric are really and truly ready and willing to participate in such a mobilization. Indeed I have confirmed these suspicions in direct interactions with the principals. I cannot speak for the s who have taken their pledge but Im dubious.Im not even positive people who say this stuff actually understand what it would entail. For example is anyone really ready to go on a rationing system? Wed definitely have to cut out or at least cut way down on meat and dairy if we were serious and that would be the least of the needed sacrifices.The US alone signed up  million troops which may be compared to the . million or so we have now. And they talk about scale so if you figure our population is perhaps . times as big as it was then wed need to sign up like  million people ready to go anywhere do anything and risk everything. Theyd also have to postpone their careers and in most cases take a big pay cut.And thats still just the beginning. It would be an exaggeration to say everyone who was not a soldier or farmer also joined the war effort in one way or another but not too much of an exaggeration. This write up does not contain many exact numbers but gives some idea of the scale and has many references. Im not sure Ive met even one person who says theyd change jobs for the sake of climate change although they must be out there perhaps waiting for a critical mass of like minded folks.So the problem with the comparison to preWWII even if it may be a very good analogy is that now were stuck waiting around for Pearl Harbor. Apparently the Sandy Katrina Haiyan various heatwaves and floods have not been enough either so more and more it appears that climates Pearl Harbor may not come for another generation or so. By then of course it will be way too late. So calling for a WWII scale mobilization is a bit like doing nothing. Its an excuse to put all the blame on the political system rather than mobilizing in much smaller numbers.My feeling is that while clearly nobody can do it alone a lot could be accomplished by dedicated activists in numbers way short of a WWIItype mobilization. Im most inspired by Rising Tide whose membership is knowledgeable active and willing to make the necessary sacrifices. Unfortunately they work outside the system which many people have a hard time with. Im pretty sure that if even a few hundred thousand people who really wanted to make a difference could come together even on the internet that we could make a huge difference and really get the ball rolling toward climate stabilization. I picture a consensusbased internet organization to start at least until we formulate a plan. I also have lots of ideas about what that plan should be but have already gone on too long.,environment,cs3aee6,2,t5_2qh1n
4250100,0,t1_cs4ol83, The movement was hijacked by the Koch brothers as we understand. The purpose of this movement should be that big government is pushing the interests of multinational corporations but instead theyre getting caught up on denying climate change and denying institutional racism.Not only does this drive a wedge between the interests of our groups but it destroys their credibility as a whole movement. The reason I try to bring attention to the variety between the people that compose the Tea Party is because it was hijacked. The actual solutions many parts of the movement embrace such as decentralized government are pushed to the sideline by politicians who instead push conservative social issues which also in no way address the big problems our country is having into the spotlight of the debate. What we should do is try to find a way to bridge the gap between the climate movement and the Tea Party movement to attack literally the main source of the issue  government and plutocracy.I think when teabaggers refer to socialism they are actually conceptualizing the idea of an authoritarian central state that controls the rights of the population. Remember most of the people that are alive that are against socialism lived through the Cold War and saw the struggle between democraticrepublican countries and dictatorships that used socialism and communism as their platform.I like decentralization. I think it would be a really great idea if the federal government fucked off on most things because the United States is really really extremely diverse and it would be stupid to impose the same rules and regulations everywhere for most cases. Some things need protection  like the climate and social rights  but by and large states and municipalities can make the best decisions for themselves. I think this could be a bridge that our movements agree upon.,environment,cs4p81s,4,t5_2qh1n

Wholly missing from the discussion is the benefit of carbon sequestration and habitat diversity from well managed pasture land as well as the benefit of reducing land to grow the immense amount of feed CAFO operations require. This reduction in land used to grow feed would mitigate the expected encroachment into new pastureland in fact they would be a fine replacement. Also the reduction in monoculture tracts to produce corn and soybean would also reduce the immense amount of non renewable inputs such as nitrogen fertilizer derived from natural gas which itself entails a slew of environmental issues. In turn water quality and nutrient load leading to eutrophication and subsequent dead zones would also be diminished. A tremendous amount of pesticide usage would also be eliminated as well.

The rural areas will get solar microgrids and Im sure theyll look into putting wind wherever they can. They also apparently plan to put some big solar installations in their deserts  which bothers me a bit since desert ecosystems tend to be rather delicate but when has destroying an ecosystem ever stopped anybody?I wish they werent putting in more coal capacity but unfortunately its been the fastest to build and they have a lot of indigenous coal to burn.

The simple reliable way of doing this is through a carbon tax.If its a revenueneutral carbon tax meaning the tax on carbon is returned to citizens through some mechanism then the opportunity exists to lower your effective tax bill choosing less carbonintensive products locally grown produce instead of from overseas choosing less carbonintensive transport bus or light rail instead of a private car and so on.EDIT Removed an inappropriate superscript.,environment,cy3i4pf,23,t5_2qh1n

6590133,0,t3_45u300,OK looked at some numbers and their claims are complete and utter nonsense.Lets start with the Zika doesnt cause microcephaly claim. The only numbers they present as evidence for this claim is a case study of  individuals out of which  tested seropositive for zika antibodies. The WHO states that the rate of microcephaly is one in several thousand. Id look deeper for an actual number but we dont need to as we can see from what we have here that their evidence is extremely weak. Suppose several thousand means . They cite a population of  seropositive individuals but make no mention of how many of those  were pregnant women which is actually the number we should be looking at. Even then if all  of those out of a total population of  were pregnant women youre still looking at an almost  chance of no microcephaly cases observed if all  of those were pregnant women who had an active Zika infection and Zika does cause microcephaly. Putting in more realistic numbers lets say half of those were female and of those females lets say  were pregnant. This is a HUGE overestimation by the way since rates of women who are currently pregnant are typically around the  range. That gives us about  pregnant women. Thats a . chance of no observed cases of microcephaly in case anyone was wondering.But wait! It gets worse! They are reporting seropositive antibody results as if those are the actual infection rates which is complete nonsense. A seropositive result simply means that the individual has produced an antibody to a protein unique to the Zika virus. This is not the same thing as having or having had an actual infection. You can get this result from being exposed to a dead or weakened form of the virus or by having a very mild infection that was completely asymptomatic. So this number is not the same as the number of people who actually had Zika. But even if we do take it to mean that their numbers are still way too small to make anything close to a definitive conclusion.So yeah they based their conclusion that Zika does not cause microcephaly on a case study that included maybe  people. To say their evidence is weak would be a major understatement.On to their claims that Pyriproxyfen is the cause. This chemical has been approved for use and widely used for over  years all over the world including the U.S. and Europe with absolutely no increase in microcephaly. The levels that people are being exposed to in their water are orders of magnitude lower than the NOEL observed in laboratory tests for teratogenic effects. The only evidence that they present for their claim is that it began being added to the water  months ago which appears to coincide with the increase in microcephaly occurrence. They make absolutely no effort to map out rates of microcephaly to levels of pyriproxyfen in the water and more importantly from a scientific standpoint make no effort whatsoever to disprove their claim by checking to see if there are increased incidences of microcephaly in areas that dont have this larvicide in their water.So all in all there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever and absolutely no scientific rigor in this report. Unless and until the authors or somebody else does the proper homework and comes up with actual evidence to support these claims I am going to bet on them being complete and utter bollocks.,environment,d00z26m,5,t5_2qh1n

6855940,0,t3_49nz2i,Hi Rudy.  Thanks for any insight you can provide.I know a number of very enthusiastic recyclers of household and office waste   who will essentially divert almost everything into the recycling bin while patting themselves on the back for a job well done.   Plastic film from the top of a food packet?  Straight in the recycle bin.    Coated paper carton for long life milk?  Straight in the recycle bin. Styrofoam takeaway box?  Recycle bin. Grease soaked Pizza box?  Recycle bin. Lamp various metals plastics and fabrics?  Recycle bin.My understanding is that it is easier and safer for the folks processing the recycling to dump an entire batch of submissions that include the wrong materials rather than going through a sorting process or pushing the wrong materials through.  As a result I always err on the side of being cautious.  I would rather send through only items I know are  recyclable assuming a  acceptance rate as compared to a  loss if there are one or two items included that are not acceptable or desirable.    Is this the right approach?  Or should I divert more items and assume there is a sorting process that will capture the recyclables and reject nonrecyclables?How should I deal with mixed materials? Lamps as an example or shoes?  How about Food contaminated items?  Is a pizza box made of cardboard a good submission at all times or not good if it has food contamination grease stains?  Is a pizza box still positive if a wax paper sheet that the pizza sat on is still inside?As a follow up... can you describe the habits of a modelideal household recycler?I realise there is a lot of regional variation  for my part I am in the UK... but would be fine with any answers being generally globalised.Thanks!,environment,d0tfgk5,54,t5_2qh1n

Why not use the  studys numbers though which are used for comparison within the study itself see Water Footprint of Animal versus Crop Products per Unit of Nutritional Value?Its also interesting that many of the foods you included in the table from the  study are dried which presumably skews the water per unit of weight stats significantly  kg of cooked oats is very different than  kg of dry oats just as  kg of beef is different from  kg of beef jerky. I obviously havent read through the entire study so let me know if the numbers account for that.gt Can you link a peer reviewed study that shows this?Sure the one you originally linked to Mekonnen gt As a general picture we find that animal productshave  a  larger  water  footprint  per  ton  of  productthan  crop  products.

I would think that people on renvironment would be devoted to applying every evidence based solution to climate change NOW because the problem gets worse for every day of inaction. Meat is a luxury. It makes no difference that we evolved by eating meat except that people still have a primal urge to eat calorie rich food products. We have progressed as a society that we can cultivate all the crops necessary for a balanced and more healthy diet. I do not want to have an even handed debate because this is not a debate these are facts. Our society must connect to the reality of the unseen affects that our everyones lifestyle has. One of the most widely accepted parts of our culture is immoral unsustainable and is leading us to catastrophe. The Western world has screwed over the rest of the world by selfishly enjoying the fruits of burning fossil fuels but it now expects developing economies to restrict their CO emissions. The same is for the developing middle classes of China and India that will want to start consuming meat which will lead to more land use especially in the last areas we have not expanded on primarily diverse ecosystems. I believe this is the reality people must face as a citizen of the world and if we dont there will be no way to enact the massive cultural shift necessary to change things.,environment,d2cg5tz,1,t5_2qh1n

7781831,0,t1_d3qk46g,Mostly true but again this technology is not limited to the US. And horizontal drilling is not new either. About  years ago the president of the oil service firm Baker Hughes made a presentation to the media during the annual Offshore Technology Conference in Houston. He said that it was possible to set up a drilling rig on the grounds of the Omni Hotel the site of the press conference drill downward then south for one mile then up through the ice skating rink in the center of the Galleria large shopping mall. And not every company that offers the service today is based in the US. I recently attended this oil industry conference in Houston. It was focused on shale oil and gas development in Argentina. Many of the speakers and participants were not from the USA. Several of the speakers compared that play with similar fields in Texas and North Dakota. They noted that most of the big players in those areas of the USA are NOT the major oil companies or the major oil service companies. Those companies are present but much of the production and the associated jobs have been generated by companies that didnt exist  years ago. They predict that the same thing will happen in Argentina. My point is not to defend Hillary the oil industry or fracking or to criticize anyone who is opposed to any of those. It is merely to observe that the international oil industry will do whatever it takes to make money regardless of politics or nationality.

8761105,0,t1_d70j5cy,I dont disagree with much of that. But the British coast you mentioned actually highlights a big difference between the two locations. In the British case you see a strip of photographed offshore water neatly following the contour of the coastline generally without the blobby effect I mentioned that shows up in the Louisiana case. It looks like the reason for this is that the map data says the LA coastline in that area is more irregular than the British coast and when the Google software outlines that somewhat imaginary irregular coastline with a strip of photographed water it produces the blobs. This is not image stitching  thats clearly visible in the British case as rectilinear lines and color differences between patches theres no blobbiness due to that. tldr The blobbiness is an attempt to follow a coastline that isnt visible on the photo.gt Its tidal mostly not lost coastline although thats where the losses are occurring its just not apparent by looking at the colour alone.Right but in the map in the OP these are pretty much the exact areas that are being marked as water with the caveats mentioned in the article.

While I think livestock contributions to climate change get overstated recently anything that could knock a few percentage points off greenhouse emissions without having to fight the hydrocarbon sector would be a win. You would still have to get the Ag industry to do it but they have been induced to change practices in the past to say prevent soil erosion.

9357806,0,t1_d90eghu,gtYou certainly believe in a cutoff point like that too  I mean I doubt you believe that a person who chooses to stay in college for  years and take degree after degree should be subsidized. We only differ in where we believe that cutoff point should be. Thou dost assume too much... I actually dont believe this.gtUniversity education is a decision you take as an adult with the hope of pursuing a specific career or higher wages.Spoken like a true educational utilitarian.  What a narrow unambitious and lowly assessment of education and its purpose.  That is not what education is for.  You are talking about job training.THE PURPOSE OF EDUCATION. Education defends against baseless superstition.  It helps you to reason why not to follow a tradition blindly. . Education helps people to transcend economic and social classes.  It is important that you be educated to a certain level in order to fit into different social settings especially across economic classes..  Education gives an intellectual logical and ethical foundation to use when addressing new and unfamiliar problems both personally and in society.  An educated person is more likely to understand complex social problems and their possible solutions.  An educated person will be better able to explain these things to others.  An educated person is more aware of their society its problems and the possible solutions.  An educated voter or elected official is better for society than an ignorant voter or leader.. Education helps to defend against illogical belief systems.  Uneducated people cannot defend themselves from illogical ideologies.  They need training to do so.. Education helps you to keep up with changes in society.  Awareness of social changes comes from education. . Education helps expose you to the rest of the world.  Education lets you remotely learn about other nations and peoples while remaining in your own. . Education is good for peace.   Uneducated people cannot properly express themselves or understand others when they express themselves.  They are more prone to argument and violent outbursts since they lack these abilities.  This causes harm to the self and to others.  Education allows you to have the coping and management tools work towards more productive and peaceful goals.. Education helps to guard against being manipulated or fooled.  An educated person listens to multiple views and evaluates them before deciding on a course of action or belief.  It is hard to fool an educated person you need reasoning and logic to trap them.. Educated people can lead healthier lives because they are more aware of the differences between healthy and unhealthy choices.  . Educated people have the tools to be more productive both personally and professionally.  Education requires you to learn how to be productive and this skill carries over into the rest of your life.. Education imparts ability to work across genres and cultures.  Uneducated people will have more difficult times working or living in new and unfamiliar settings.  Knowledge and education gives the ability and selfconfidence  to not be intimidated by challenges life throws on you.. Educated people are more selfsufficient.  They have a larger tool kit to manage life and its challenges.  selfsufficient people are economically productive people.  A nation filled with productive and educated people is a wealthy nation.  . Educated people can make bigger contributions to the next generation.  Educated mothers have lower child mortality rates.  Educated parents tend to have fewer children with better lifestyles rather than having many children to get many working hands.  Also educated parents ensure that their children get proper nutrition and medical care resulting in them growing into more competent adults.. Education gives tools to manage and overcome failure.  Educated people will have have multilevel goals and a number of ways to reach them. They will be better at turning dreams in concrete actions.. Educated means you will be more selfdependent and have a more reputable standing in society. By simply being educated you have less job insecurity no inferiority complex and a well organized understanding of the world.  This in turn helps lead to a happy life.. The language and communication skills developed through education help you to communicate your ideas more clearly both in your personal and professional relationships.  Understanding and being understood by others means more successful relationships and social life.You have taken something fundamentally important to the betterment of the human experience and reduced it to nothing more than job training.  This is actually pretty distressing.ON CUTOFF POINTS  HOW MUCH EDUCATION IS ENOUGH?Your assuming that there needs to be cutoff point is equally concerning... Do you not know that Masters and PhD students actually have to DO things in order to succeed and move on?  You talk about education as though it doesnt fundamentally change through the levels.Education stops being about notes lectures and tests at the Masters level and at the PhD level you should be able to give the lectures and the tests.  Masters and PhD students do valuable work research and development.  They investigate complex problems and issues very deeply because they have the time often no fulltime job and the obligation still a student to do so.  They can then present their results and findings to commercial political and social leaders.  These leaders often do not have the time for such indepth analysis and investigation because they are too busy leading.  A president is often only as good as his or her advisors.You seem to assume that if no one ever leaves education that this means they are sitting in classes and taking tests forever.  This is not true.  This type of educational experience ends after the Bachelors level.  Masters and PhD student make huge contributions to the sum total of human knowledge and experience through their work.As a taxpayer I can see no reason why an endless PhD student getting doctorate after doctorate should be assumed to be useless or a waste of money.  They may in fact be doing very valuable work contributing to our culture our technology our society and even our understanding of ourselves.So no I dont believe in an free education cutoff.  I dont believe in this because I understand just enough about the world to know how much we have yet to discover and understand.  As long a person would truly be devoting themselves to an ever expanding quest for knowledge and would share that through teaching publishing research results making discoveries or even just discovering and documenting things that dont work I see no reason to cut off education benefits.As a taxpayer I would much rather subsidize this than to subsidize yet one more war.,environment,d926406,1,t5_2qh1n

9518726,0,t1_d9mctfr,gtSo Im super curious because I read about this in the past do yall use some kind of bacteria to clean up spills? The details are fuzzy but I read that we found a bacteria that feeds on crude or something and we were trying to utilize for clean ups. Now as you can imagine there are a lot of variables but I will just talk in general terms. There are products out there that contain designer microorganisms specifically marketed for degrading crude. I dont really use them much because all of the microorganisms that I need are already in the soil. Really the only time I use them is because the client asks for a product and I can sell it at a good markup sorry. Its mostly just snake oil and its not going to hurt anything by applying it. Oil for the most part degrades like any other organic substance. Microbes use it as a carbon source just like they use a dead animal. Now this process can take a long time and is depended on temperature oxygen concentrations in the soil soil moisture etc.  You obviously dont want a bunch of oily dirt on location infiltrating and spreading so we typically use other methods like land farming off site soil shredding dig and haul etc. gtThanks for saying all that! I work in oil and gas and its hard to explain to people that not every spillI hear you. Threads like this frustrate the hell out of me. There is just so much misinformation. Half the time if I try to educate people they just call me a shill. gtand its hard to explain to people that not every spill not even half of them are on the scale of Deep Water Horizon. Of course any time theres a massive spill its an environmental disaster and tragedy theres no denying that. Deep water horizon was the worst case scenario. I have never worked off shore but I have worked in rivers and lakes. I dont know what I would do with a spill like DWH... There isnt much you can do but recover as much product as possible. I sure as fuck wouldnt have sunk it like they did. That fact that oil floats is about the only thing you have on your side.

Back then the movement was a lot less strong but now all these small urban farms are popping up looking for volunteers and other help. Where I go to school theres an organization called MEVO mevoearth.org started by someone who is a good friend of mine while he was in high school. His story is a really uplifting one and I hope it inspires you. If your area has a trail conference of some sorts I know they do a lot of environmental work such as removing invasive plant species and such many outdoor groups and the people in them Ive found are more likely to have the same views and goals towards the environment as you do. If you see there are people at your school who are mutually interested in the environment you could see what it would take to start an environmental club at school if you find that interests you. I wish there was more I could list but it goes to show how ahead of the game you are. Many people dont start their environmental careers until college age at least.

In this work we propose a method to evaluate the influence of this extract on milk properties using propyl propane thiosulfonate PTSO as a marker. PTSO is extracted using a quick easy cheap effective rugged and safe procedure and monitored by highperformance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The method was applied to milk samples obtained from  dairy cows fed during  months with enriched feed. In addition a milk tasting panel was established to evaluate the PTSO residue that should not be exceeded to guarantee milk sensory attributes. It was established that a value of PTSO lower than  mg kg does not alter milk organoleptic properties. This fact makes onion extract an interesting alternative as a feed supplement to control the methane emissions without any influence on milk attributes.   ,environment,dcp0iij,5,t5_2qh1n

Many regions that are used for animal farming can be used to grow other crops etc. I dont know what the flowon effects of a meat ban would be but of course I wouldnt advocate that without carefully thinking about the consequences. A tax on animal products seems better because you can use the tax revenue to help transition farmers and support plantbased and environmentally friendly practices. You have to be careful with a meat tax though if you focus on the worst food for environmental damage e.g. free range beef you may push producers and consumers to chicken and fish which will cause a large increase in animal suffering.

Those lands include National Park Servicemanaged parks and programs that were valued at  billion and pour billions of dollars into local economies.Trump instituted a federal hiring freeze preventing nearly  fulltime National Park Service jobs from being filled and potentially impacting summer seasonal employment  which means your camping plans may have to be put off indefinitely.Seasonal employment isnt affectedUtah Republicans passed a resolution for the states federal delegation to shrink Grand StaircaseEscalante National Monument and urged Trump to rescind the Obama order that created Bears Ears National Monument.Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz introduced a bill that would have placed . million acres of public lands in private hands including wetlands endangered species habitat and important cultural and historical resources. Public outrage forced him to withdraw it.HR Chaffetz also tried to eliminate the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Managements law enforcement entities  putting the pressure on local agencies which dont have the resources funding or expertise to enforce federal law on public lands.HR Interior Secretary Zinke repealed a bar on lead ammunition in parks and refuges allowing wildlife land and water to be poisoned.

11416031,0,t1_dfpviad,So if I understand it correctly there are basically three sources of funding for roads Gas tax Use tax tolls etc Money raised from general taxes bond sales etc  local state federalWhat happens when a ton of cars start using no gas at all? You either tax electric cars or you start putting up tolls or you figure out a way to raise taxes through other means or some combination of the above.This is the same issue with solar and wind power. Getting electricity from your utility has two costs the cost of generating electricity and the cost to transport it there ie infrastructure. For pretty much the entire history of electric utilities everyone hooked up to the power grid was using power so it was pretty easy to just charge per energy unit. But now that tons of people have rooftop solar not to mention wind generators you have people who are using the grid for both drawing and selling power but who arent actually paying for any of the infrastructure because on balance theyre about neutral in terms of power use.Unless you raise taxes only from the entire public youre basically going to do something that gets you labeled as taxing electric cars or taxing solar power or whatever. No. Its infrastructure cost. We use infrastructure we pay for it.,environment,dfpzure,7,t5_2qh1n

11483269,0,t1_dfx6mqu,I didnt think the march was ever just about science funding and climate change.  It has always been about the fact that the Trump administration seems to pose a serious threat to scientists freedom to gain funding and to learn how to combat climate change.  It wasnt accidental that this march was proposed shortly after Trumps election.  Scientists seem to feel that they have already been antagonized by Trump and seem also to worry that this will continue to worsen if they dont do something about it.  The issue is essentially political and thats not a bad thing.Heres what that means  Scientists a traditionally privileged and respected group within our society are beginning to worry about state suppression. Some scientists are organizing and agitating against that suppression.  In this activity it makes sense to seek the friendship and material support of those groups who have interests which naturally align with their own.In the case of the scientists who are marching there are at least two sets of natural allies.  First groups who are affected by climate change  i.e. everyone.  Second groups who also worry about state suppression  i.e. those who worry about colonization racism immigration native rights et. al.  It makes good strategic sense to build alliances with such groups.  These groups have been organizing to prevent and in response to state oppression for a long time and they have long understood the strength to be gained in standing together.  It is I must admit very strange to think of scientists as being in danger of becoming an oppressed element of our society but ... well here we are.Tweets like the one you linked are not hurting your cause theyre helping it.  If you really think there is a danger that the government will continue to turn against scientists to the detriment of us all then surely you recognize that asking them politely to stop will do nothing.  You dont need to worry about whether or not they take you seriously.  If you have enough support you can force them to.  You need to build alliances with other groups in society whose interests naturally align with your own.  Thats precisely what that tweet does.,environment,dfxmkf4,1,t5_2qh1n
