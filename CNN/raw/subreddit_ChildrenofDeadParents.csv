464475,0,t3_1xtlmu,I am so sorry for your loss. Anger and depression are very common I am going through the same thing. I have also threatened suicide. However that is just not the way to go out of this world. I know in my heart that my grandma she raised me after my parents died when I was  wouldnt want me to end my life just to be reunited with her. Being angry and depressed is totally understandable and okay but if you are contemplating or worse planning suicide please talk to someone. Call a hotline a friend a family member anyone who you can talk to in an honest manner and who you believe would understand your pain you would probably be surprised at how many people in your life would do anything to help you. Therapy whether in a group or oneonone has helped me immensely. The anger is subsiding but the depression is still there. I hate to say this it will take a while but you will eventually feel some sense of normal again as you cope with living with a hole in your heart.  I really hope that this helps some and if it doesnt I apologize. Just know that I and many others sympathize with you and you will be in my thoughts. Hang in there. ,ChildrenofDeadParents,cft291a,2,t5_2zmz1
8669653,0,t3_4wz772,Hey.  I dont have much to add.  I just wanted to let you know youre not alone.  My dad passed from a heart attack at age  last weekend.  Its been weird.  Right now I feel like I can exist and even still laugh but Ill never really be truly happy again.  I wish there was some way to fix it for both of us.  I have a lot of questions about religion and life after death right now... What if my dads just gone?  It matters so much now. But one bible verse someone shared with me that was strangely comforting is this onePsalm  The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.,ChildrenofDeadParents,d6pbs7s,2,t5_2zmz1
