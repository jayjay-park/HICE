1148950,0,t3_27a1jy,its freaking awesome! I love that it has to go past a stage systemI do not like that there are ridiculous slam takedowns so often and those take downs are so freaking hard to stop.Everything else is perfect except for the way it lets you spam all of the spinning kicks and crazy moves without getting super exhausted right away. I think those higher risk moves should come at a stamina price so that they are thrown less common and it will make the game feel more real. You normally see guys save their energy for those moves maybe slow them down considerably like they do the overhands you can throw because right now in the demo the kicks come super fast and accurate regardless of stamina. I think putting a stamina limit on the crazy takedowns ltEspecially and the wild Show boat kicks and making them more realistic would be great. Or at least have a simulation mode in game so you can appeal to the hardcore players and the casual players. But seriously on the takedowns Takedowns should be earned because its a difficult thing to do and of course I understand the timing of shooting a takedown so there will have to be something that allows you to perfectly time the takedown but  you are gonna get taken down when someone shoots in the game but I did see that there was a problem with takedowns on the forum so idk where its gonna go.what do you think uthebrizzo,EASportsUFC,chyvbt8,3,t5_2y7cr

6964556,0,t3_4b010t,As I said in another post. There is a definitely a lack of investment in Career Mode from EA. They focused more on the Ultimate Team Easy Cash Grab that they added to almost all their sport games. Now I wont be surprised to see a form of Ultimate Team in Battlefield  when they will release it. Another thing they removed what could add a little bit of variety in career mode THE SPONSORS  the ability to edit your fighting gear colors. Why?I remember when I got UFC  I couldnt stop playing for months. Now with UFC  after a few hours it gets quickly monotonous it also feels a bit too easy.

7028718,0,t3_4budky,How does making it to division  qualify as very good? The first  divisions from my experience have been people who have rudimentary striking and practically no ground game.Anyway if you know when your opponent is going for strikes you really shouldnt be getting hit by them all that much. Either block one attack then hit back to body with a quick straight use a strike that outranges them e.g. leg and body kicks from max distance or get close and go back and theyll miss their attacks. I have a huge stamina advantage over most people in nd and rd by just making them miss their attacks while being accurate myself.

8858112,0,t3_51bs0i,My advice? Guard specialist rubber guard get good at blocking from there. Believe me people will FEAR your guard.The clinch? If hes got you in single collar fake to Thai once or twice then throw up the flying armbar. Not necessarily to get the submission they escape the first gate theyre back in your guard. Now they really wont wanna clinch!This works a treat for me most of the time. The problem is Im really bad standing so I try n win in guard but if youre decent standing you should be able to use these to make people fight the fight you want to fight.Oh if they start blocking rubber guard as theyre expecting it throw up a triangle or fake rubber and throw it up.Another tip just since Im sharing lol not really relevant to your question. If your in mount postured up youve blocked some transitions and the opponent has really low stamina BUT the person is a fucking ninja at arm trapping and you just cant get the damn finish...Let them have the arm trap!! Im talking about the one where they can sweep you back to guard. Let them have the arm trap dont even try and stay postured upThis means you keep all your stamina it doesnt drain let them fill up the slow ass wheelUsing up what little stamina they had in the first place... Then when in guard take your pick what submission to throw up immediately armbar triangle omo kimura etc. As they have low stamina you high And I think momentum comes into it from the sweep Its pretty much guaranteed to start and if youre any good at the minigame should get you the win Anyway sorry not been here in a while P,EASportsUFC,d7cmbpp,1,t5_2y7cr

9767912,0,t3_51nsqs,I have had zero interest in video games and the last one I was actually addicted to was the arcade version of PacMan back in the s. When my youngest son who is a Greco wrestler and goes to Northern Michigan UniversityOTC Olympic Training Center came home for the summer he brought his Xbox and this game. I am an ex boxer and a big MMA fan and thought he was watching a fight for a split second when I walked in his room and then realized it was a video game. For you guys who are gamers the graphics must not be jaw dropping compared to some of those other mind boggling mystic type games but I was blown away.Since we are extremely close as well as competitive he challenged me and from the first game I was hooked! The day he left to go back to college I ran out and bought an Xbox and the game and havent missed a day of playing yet lol.I think it is incredible how the game plays and I dont think most players realize how complex the game really is. I understand where the OP is coming from and I just dont get a lot of guys who complain about the game. I have spent months practicing keeping a log book of transitions and tricks and tips as well as following  elite players Youtube channels. I waited  months before starting to play on line and just put my Ultimate Team in to action this week as I waited until I felt I was good enough not to get smoked. I cant believe how horrible so many players are and I have close to  nasty messages from guys I beat by taking them to the ground and doing a Khabib on them in side saddlethe crucifix and backside. It is a MMA game and not a boxing or kick boxing game and it boggles my mind that players get mad if you take the fight to the ground.For the longest I didnt like getting annihilated in the clinch but I had to keep on practicing to where now I am comfortable and aggressive in that department but the one thing that really burns my a are the guys who try and cheap shot you when you go to touch gloves! Those are the players I enjoy putting right into the crucifix early on and watch them get frustrated as I lump them up.,EASportsUFC,dah41cn,1,t5_2y7cr

10136857,0,t3_5k72ej,TLDRmore choices over the entrance statistics more sculpting options adaptive ai is goofy and unrealistic toward championship levels lastly tuf should come with a bonus if you win it stats wiseuse career guys in offline modes outside of careerExplanationsI hate the three things they mention about you before you enter the ring. Has won  fights in a row Seems like the same things over and over. I wish the career had a better storyline. Having rivalries with other fighters choosing a gym to fight for Alpha Male or something like thatAgree with the entrance banter I even felt it was stupid in UFC Undisputed  because there were a few no matter what you did you couldnt achieve like former ncaa champion and a few others that I dont remember. I think the aggressive style eluded me until a few months ago I got it during preorder so Ive played multiple careers and its crazy because Im literally always aggressive. It was really wild this one tries to go based off stats and facts like wow last x of x by submissionko and I appreciate thatBut we should just be able to pick one or two then they fill in one or two randomly. Gameface  always bad. Super happy they added sculpt just wish it was more options to sculpt.More sliders in general would be nice I do like the adaptive ai but really lol facing Sage Northcutt on adaptive AI and I cant even tap him with level  subs and  in chokes? Full stamina mind you his stamina below a quarter. And my grapple advantage is high. It becomes a bit silly it said adaptive not unbalanced...unrealistic...garbage tier.Its a lot of disappointing things about career especially the fact I cant even use my fighter mostly looking at my record for use in my own offline modes. That is horrible. Not even KO mode with my brother. I know you can just create a guy but what I like about career fighters is you cant just grab every perk you see fit and pop it up to . You had to work for it so you should also be able to play with those guys offline.And picking a camp would be okay but they could not go the UFC undisputed  route with that locking you into a playstyle or moves based solely on that camp. That pissed me off to no end. Also the career damage and odd random shit should end. Im not going to deal with a coach as a professional fighter who is always flaking on me via health bad money management etc. Its just goofy and unnecessary.Also agree with uthebigfudge Im not saying I need to be heman out there but anything sub  lol as a ufc fighter seems unrealistic or hell make TUF and your performances in it give you a small overall boost when jumping into the ufc. You did just train with either former champions or perennial contenders as coaches. Makes zero sense you would gain fookin nuttin from them.,EASportsUFC,dbsu4n2,1,t5_2y7cr

11568802,0,t3_5waokg,Dam! This thread really turned in to a giant cluster fck! As I stated in my post which turned out to be more of a blog lol I dont want to pile on the OP but I dont get your point? After playing the game for almost  months before finally feeling I could compete on line I was pretty shocked at how easy I was breezing through the first  divisions and then things started getting harder  transitions and reversals I never saw before and the wins started becoming harder.As I stated I really know shit from Shinola about video games but since this is the only game I play I put all my time in to overcoming this. Not intended for you but till today the most satisfieing win I have had was in my th WBW fight in Div which shocked me because it was a title fight and I only had a total of about  fights on line total. I knew the guy I was fighting was head and shoulders more advanced than me as he dropped me  or  times and also had me on the ground another  or  completely drained of stamina. This is the moronic type player because he should of just ended the fight but let me up or walked to the side after a knockdown to do his moronic Nate Diaz taunt. I would die before I ever quit at anything and just kept getting up and getting my ass handed to me. The bottom line is with less than  seconds left in the fight he got nailed with a perfect  piece and tucked to sleep It was almost as good as getting laid! When I looked at his record he was something like  Div and on the longest title defense streak he ever had at . He was the first guy I ever sent a message to but was off line in less than  seconds probably breaking shit.I couldnt wait to get out of the early divisions where you have a majority of players who want to play RockemSockem Robots and message you calling you a pussy if you take them to the ground. The guys who are good are mainly guys with  overall fighters who cant cut it above Div and basically ruin the game for new players with OP fighters. I wrote the post below a month ago and am just getting back to playing on line because there was so much to learn  I am talking some deep game play. Not everyone in the higher divisions play the way you state but you should take that as a challenge and take a hiatus to figure out how to win on that level. I am by myself with this game and my friends would think I cracked up if I told them how addicted I am to this game. At least I am sure you know a lot of guys who are gamers and could easily help you. It is a fighting game and I am sure more than half the players have had some experience with a combat sport and those who are strict gamers want to win just as badit is called being competitive!,EASportsUFC,dg7bv3i,0,t5_2y7cr
