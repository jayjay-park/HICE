So that would help us out since FO is on tumblr  we need a picture! A pic on the sidebar showing the man we are all Subredding about! Make it a deep picture. Deep......as the Ocean  sort of a weird idea but maybe we can do a PostOff When the album drops post a picturescreenshot of your digitalphysical copy in an official Mod post. Itll show new redditors how much people love Frank Ocean and hopefully theyll sub for more FO news and updates!Ok thats all i got ,FrankOcean,ctd4j58,2,t5_2tyek

So I started looking for other Tyler songs and I stumbled upon She and loved his verse. I completely forgot about it for a while until my friend told me to listen to Novacane and I fell in love with that obviously.

8320319,0,t3_4ti7me,what we know about the album is a difficult question. what we know about the music he has been making is a much more interesting question. Frank said way back in  that he was listening to the beach boys and the Beatles for inspiration this time around which could hint at some light psychedelicrock inspired content opposed to the rampbsoul feel of CO. Multiple people Inc Earl and Brian Wilson of the beach boys have suggested that Frank raps now in fact brian wilson was quoted as saying that frank wouldnt feature on his LP because all he wanted to do was rap. As of  Chance told Zane Lowe that Frank had been experimenting with some autotune vocal effects the same ones Kanye had on chances intro track on Colouring Book. ,FrankOcean,d5hlgs7,3,t5_2tyek

Its actually inevitable there WILL be some people that say they dont like it. Its taken this long and Im sure some people expect for heavens gates to open once the album drops. It seems like hes working hard to make a perfect album but at this point it has me wondering if hes trying to do too much. Everyone will have their opinion on it once we hear it. For me personally Im a Frank fan. I genuinely enjoy his music but my ONLY worry on this album is if he tries to rap too much.

Honestly though the stream is endorsed by Apple and regardless of the possibility of Frank Ocean having the last say as the artist Apple would not permit the stream to on suuppeerr long and definitely not as long until November as some people suggest.

He reminds of the things I didnt do but wanted to do so much  Want to see nirvana but dont wanna die yeah It also reminds me of a time where I had broken up with an ex but we her and I used to still romantically talk and not totally be out of each others lives. This kind of transition period where you know its the right decision but you still want to feel that person  Wanna feel that nana though could you come by The best part for me is the feeling of having gotten over and let go of someone wishing them all the best for what theyre currently doing and planning to do in the future  You were from my past life I hope youre doing well bruhHe repeats  Hope youre doing well bruhAnd then the sense of comfort that comes when he exclaims the start of something new or perhaps just having come to terms with who you are and what has happened  New beginnings New beginnings wake up ,FrankOcean,d72c36v,2,t5_2tyek

I saw Frank the night before at the Metro and I came back for his lollapalooza set. It was crazy the crowd before the start of the set people were rushing to get in front the entitled white girl pushing her way to the front we know you from the burbs. It was packed for someone who just debuted their album in less than a month. Frank came on playing the Sade cover. I had my phone out recording parts of his performance. When Thinkin bout You came on I noticed this short girl trying to get a recording. Nothing but arms for her. I offered my hand and held  phones to record the rest. She thanked me. She asked if she can get my recording as well I agreed. We enjoyed the set I didnt want to talk to much cause I know people really wanted to listen to Frank. People were willing to trade their Sunday wristbands just to see him the night prior. And I figured we were going to exchange info at the end.Pyramids came on I knew it was the last song cause I was there the night before. About half way in she said shell be back she needed to use the washroom. I knew she wasnt going to get back given how far up we were. The set ended Frank never played the song he wrote for Beyonc I Miss You when he was in Chicago thats the only gripe I had about his set. The cried clear and the lights came on. I waited for about  minutes. She never came back. Still this is my most iconic photo of the set. Always brings back memories. ,FrankOcean,d7ewpu8,3,t5_2tyek

The auto tune is set up. Its less than a  show its just seeing him live. No show. He is to big now it would be like seeing Kanye West. I like small artist live so maybe I could meet them. When artist get as big as Frank I just let them go. Then I look back in the underground for that new shit and you know how it goes. ,FrankOcean,dcwbt5w,-13,t5_2tyek

Im not an emotional man I dont try to be a tough type its just that I was never one to show my emotions growing up. This part though...I recently changed to a much better job than Ive ever had in my life and its amazing. My life is going in a great direction now. It just reminded me when I called my mom and dad when I got this job and it helps me realize how far Ive come with the help of my parents. My dad has always done a lot for me and growing up I didnt have the best relationship with my mom but slowly Im realizing that a lot of what she did was to better my life. Typing this out and listening to the song is actually making me cry...IM AT WORK DAMNIT! Ah well props to this bit as it will always make me really think about my life and what Ive come from and hopefully Ill keep improving myself.

11500414,0,t1_dfzkcit,To me the main advantages of Apple Music are the exclusives Beats  and the integration with iOS. I guess its nice that iTunes usually updates at  PM EST instead of Midnight EST like Spotify but thats pretty minor. Other than those Spotify is better in pretty much every other category. Better I would say objectively faster and subjectively cleaner UI better social features better audio quality better appdevice support like Last.fm scrobbling and the PS app. Probably some other things Im forgetting since I havent used Spotify since AM launched in . To me the exclusives on AM and integration with iOS are enough to best all of Spotifys other advantages. But its ultimately up to you. I know plenty of people on Spotify who just torrent shit if its exclusive for more than like an hour or are on Android and thus dont benefit from iOS integration.,FrankOcean,dfzklfg,1,t5_2tyek
