8791778,0,t1_d74mfk2,Thanks for the detailed info. The last thing I read was that Charles was struggling to get back into feature role shape and Ware would lead the RBCC.That certainly sounds like a better situation than Vereen who is a rd down back or CAP or Coleman who I could also deal for who would likely need an injury.I noticed Wares numbers last year but wasnt really sure if he was the type of guy who would hold off the competition. I really just need a safe back and dont need to overpay.,KeeperFF,d74nd3h,1,t5_38iy4
