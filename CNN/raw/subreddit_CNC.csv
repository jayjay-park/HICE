1018639,0,t1_chir2eu,Yeah I also tried dxfgcode and it made the wrong code syntax but like you mentioned it would be a pretty simple matter to write a text editor that reformats the code properly.  Too bad you couldnt get FastCAM to work As for the RS contraption that was juryrigged to the Burny where I work  Ill try to give as much detail as possible and also I will try to remember to take a picture of it for you on Monday when Im there.The Burny control units only communication port is what appears to be a DB parallel port like people used to use in the s for printer networks.  If its not DB its one of those long flat connectors.  I dont dare take it off to check because its caked with so much dust that Im afraid Id get the pins dirty and it would never work again.  I think the specification is probably in the several thousand page long manual on the shelf in my office so I will check there time permitting.Since there is no computer workstation nearby to plug in the CNC they set up this small plastic box that requires its own little wallwart power supply which converts serial input to presumably parallel output for the DB.  The box black in colour and is about cm long by cm wide and maybe  to cm tall.  It lays flat on top of the control unit and has  ordinary USB . I think ports on front side.  The back side has the enormous DB port going to the Burny a red power LED that illuminates when you plug in the wallwart and the small circular port for plugging in the power supply.  The box itself does have a label but I cant recall exactly what it says.  But I do know that it says RS on it.  Maybe its ridiculous to describe the converter box in so much detail since there are probably hundreds or thousands of them for sale that look totally different but do the same thing.  But there you go.The interface to the control unit displays a main menu with options you select by pressing the up or down key and enter key.  On the Burny I do see an option for loading CNC programs from a floppy drive but this is not in use.  If you scroll up one menu item from the Load FLOPPY menu item the option reads Load from RS.  So I suppose this is a function which was available since the machine was created a long time ago by MG Industries or Burny or whoever the hell made it.  Maybe check to see if there is such an option on your schools Burny?  It may not be called RS.  It might be called something like Load from USB or Load from Serial.  Just explore the options for loading programs and use your judgement.Anyways I basically just make my CAD drawing save it as DXF load it into FastCAM define the toolpath and generate the CNC code.  When I generate the code FastCAM spits it out into a text file with a .CNC extension by default.  I generally name the file with a string of numbers such as .CNC or .CNC for example.  The reason for only numbers I will explain shortly.  I take the .CNC file and put it on an ordinary flash drive much like Im sure you do with your Burny and take it out to the RS converter on top of the Burny.  I plug it into that box in either of the  USB ports and select the menu item for Load from RS.  I am prompted to enter the name of the file.  Since the Burny does not to my knowledge have a way of inputting alphabetic characters I am forced to enter numbers.  This is why I had to name the .CNC files with numbers only.  Maybe you have a similar experience?Anyways that loads the program from the flash drive and I can proceed to run the program.  Hopefully that wall of text was of some help to you.  Good luck on finding the RS converter box and whatnot.  Wish I could give you more information.,CNC,chk2rim,1,t5_2ralu

1138696,0,t1_chxhe02,So the story is that the delveloper edition is going to be for sale in a constantly evolving state. Whenever we make a change to anything the developer edition gets that right away. We literally are changing something on it at least once a week right now. But its little stuff. Its all based on feedback from users. Then we are going to have another edition out soon that will only change once a year or so. The reasoning is that THIS version is going to be UL listed. And to get UL listing every time you make any changes it needs to be approved by UL again. This one will come with extra guards and safety features etc. Many companies and schools ESPECIALLY schools are not allowed to use any equipment that does not carry a UL certification.

6133853,0,t1_cymh0q2,Wow lots of questions   Let me tackle the ones I know and Ill address the rest when I get home and can measure stuff on the mill. CNC controller computer and mill are on the same power strip.  I have these long ft strips along my walls and they are all on the same outletcircuit.  The entire  computer monitor mill etc should be fine with a single A breaker.  In reality the motor draws the most power and it only does so under heavy load. This is highly variable and not really possible to determine.  The spindle motor is a HP motor which is roughly  watts.  Most of the time you will be around half of that and for heavy cuts it may momentarily shoot up to  watts.  the main power supply for the motor controllers is a W supply but its probably only ever running at .  a fast rapid on all  axes will make this jump up higher but you wouldnt be cutting during rapids on all three motors   In summary a normal A outlet will be just fine.  If youre running a compressor and other stuff at the same time and the machine gets bogged down with a heavy cut you might have a problem. I havent replaced the feet.  Tormach MIGHT start using feet in the next shipments.  Im going to wait and see what they do before I replace anything. Ill have to check on this one.  The machine is significantly more rigid than the stand so theres not much shimming necessary.  The machine comes with a piece of paper that shows the QC for the machine the tolerances etc for THAT specific machine. Let me check. Let me check. Let me check. It needs to be filled when empty?  I think they recommend a shot of oil once a week or something like that Id have to check.  Its actually really easy to get to even with the machine up against the wall.  The lefthand side of the enclosure comes right in front of it and theres a good amount of room between the wall and the back of the enclosure.  Thats where the pump sits.  You can easily get to it with the enclosure and up against the wall. The deluxe kit comes with flood cooling.  The kit was backordered and didnt ship with my machine but in theory it would come with this kit.  I will be getting it in a few weeks.

8673199,0,t1_d6pj9ul,Thanks for your comment Let me discuss it with you Projecta introduces the first technique in PCB prototyping that almost doesnt require any tools special materials or equipment thats the concept we introduce. Before we built Projecta we worked with all used techniques known in PCB fabrication and tried CNC engraving with very advanced CNC machines and as you said there are Vbits with .mm at the tip but for sure once you use it its tip gets eroded and become wider usually gt.mm. I didnt talk about the exhaust or even cost of vbits I discuss with you the manufacturing concept! To use a small amp precise vbits you need to have a very stable accurate CNC machine which of course costs times of yours. The most accurate technique which gives very high resolution in PCB is photoresist dry films which applied by most factories worldwide so we wanted to make the machine approaches the resolution of dry films without requiring photoresist films or its equipment as laminator UV light developers....... and shaping the circuit on your board as easy as printing a paper in a very clean process and you dont have to feed it with any material or special conductive inks or caring about the bits and spindles issues or anything else. In addition we are working to improve the clearance to reach the minimum trace width the machine provides .mm and less but as you know we cant publish a resolution more than what we have tested and verified. Our technical team does his best to achieve this accuracy in clearance also before we finish our campaign on kickstarter and once we verified that we will announce.,CNC,d6prsh2,1,t5_2ralu

8860993,0,t1_d7cv1ol,All modern stepper driver are microstepping.  It doesnt really add to much accuracy but it does smooth out the motor motion. If done right will give more rpm.  I always use microstepping drives set to  or  microsteps never any higher. I havent used that particular model  drive so I cant comment on the performancequality.  I do know the real leadshine digital version is very good.  The knock off clones may not be.  Have you tried all the drivesmotors?  Maybe one or several are faulty.  There is a mach tuning PDF available. Check Power supply voltage to be sure it is volts.  Some switching supplies do have a voltage adjust usually around . What Kind of PC and OS version?  I run XP SP on all my mach installs.  Some even with low end p CPUs.   Almost any old PC should spin a stepper motor faster than rpm even with higher microstepping settings.  Thats about k stepssecond microstep setting.   Even my very old P does atleast k stepssecond.  If its not a PC issue then it is usually the drivermotor combination.  mh inductance is rather high and may not be a good fit for those drivers you have.  ,CNC,d7cysuy,1,t5_2ralu

9308755,0,t3_57y46n, When creating a Gcode program you need to have a drawing choose tooling and procedures to make the part and then a software that can generate the program to complete those chosen procedures.You have a .DXFillustrator file already so you have your drawing. What you need to do now is generate a part program to make the part and it needs to be in Gcode. Normally a shop owner can take a drawing and make the program himself. Have you tried to send the owner the file to see if he can make a program from it? that is standard procedure. If that is not the case then you need to generate a part program for him. If your part drawing is not overly complex then the program should be an easy one. That being said generating a part program is not for the uninitiated. You have to think about types of tools being used what gets cut when and at what RPM and federate to use. How will the tools ramp in and ramp out? Does the part need to be machined on the other side? Will it need a special way to hold onto the material so it can be machined? These are just some of the questions a programmer must answer as they make their part program.Mastercam will be able to generate a Gcode program. That is what it is designed for. Use what you know.Im not familiar with Mastercam but Gcoding softwares follow similar principles but in slightly different ways.You need to Import your drawing. If you have saved it as a DXF files then that should work as it is the most common file type to import in these kinds of software. Operation Order Using the software  plan out how the part is going to be machined. Does it have intricate detailing or is it simple cutouts? How many tools will it take? Will there be a roughing and finishing pass? That will lead you to choosing the operations that will be needed and then you can set the order of them cutting the outer profile of the part is best left for last as you want the part to not move.Program each operation. Choose the tool that can do the operation and assign it to the element of the drawing you want it to cut. Repeat for each tooloperation until you have a complete part programSimulate the program. Watch how the tools are being used and fix any problems that show up in the simulationOutput Gcode program. Post the program to a file and send it to the shop owner. He will load it onto his machine and run the program to make the part.If you have little experience with Mastercam I would find someone who does and give them your DXF file and have them make the program for you. There are so many questions that programmers have to solve to make a part program that it isnt easy to list them.If you dont have anyone who can then the next best thing is to look up howtoprogramMastercam videos and watch how they make part programs. Pay close attention to creating tools assigning toolpaths simulating posting.Good luck.EDIT I made a mistake. Posting of a program cant be done unless that Software has a post specific for the machine it is going onto. Your Mastercam needs a post configured for the Mozaik and Aspyre software or else the CNC wont be able to run that program correctly. Think of CNC machines as language specific and the Post is a language translator that converts the Gcode into a language specific Gcode program for that particular machine.,CNC,d8vyap1,2,t5_2ralu

10546450,0,t3_5qzzy9,Ive got the shapeoko .  It was a bit of a pain to put together and had to use a shim to bring it into square.  The other issue with the Shapeoko is that it comes without any work holding solution.  No rails or screws on the waste board to hold a clamp.  I tried using tape to hold a work piece and it broke free and beat the hell out of the gantry before I could shut the machine down.  Never using tape again.  Ive attached a second waste board that I can use clamps on to resolve that. The upside to all this is that Im very comfortable doing maintenance on machine now.  If something on the machine breaks I could have it apart again and fixed in no time.  For any of these hobby level machines I think that experienceability is a must.  I would suggest adding in a couple weeks of learning curve to your plans for any of them that you buy.  The pro built machines that you can run more or less out of the box cost thousands more. Id recommend the Shapeoko to anyone.  It requires some sweat but the experience if valuable.  The software that comes with it is pretty good.  Youll likely use other software for advanced designs but still use their grbl software to run the machine.

11438174,0,t1_dfsb6jb,gt So no dedicated software but I dont spend a lot of time tracking down info. Id say it probably takes me  minutes to isolate old files for a particular part and store them under old files or closed filesif we get a revision.It would be that easy and usually is if Im only dealing with less than  parts and my process is similar to your in that regard. The trouble is when its  parts or more. My process goes something like . Sort new parts into folders based on material thickness. . ToolProgram parts on Salvagnini PS amp Finn Power Turret.. Make new unit nests on both punching machines unless they are just updates  then I just swap out the new part for the old one.. Transfer updated nests from my PC to the actual machines.. Clean up. I have to search  for single part nests unit nests and nests where an old part may have been used for filler. On both machines and my PC. The Salvagnini software offers no way to just delete a part out of the library. You have to navigate to the folder windows search the part name and each part for some dumb reason has like  files associated with it. Its  a similar process on the Finn Power. After doing this for only a few parts the whole process gets old. It would be nice to have a search tool that could handle a list of part names and loop through them searching for old revisions and deleting specified file types. ,CNC,dfsi8bu,1,t5_2ralu
