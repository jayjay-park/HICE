North Korean military forces were deployed to retake control of one of the sources of those exports..... the emaciated poorly trained North Korean forces were beaten  very badly  by Uncle Jangs loyalists....

231086,0,t1_cf4nrnd,Ill try to find the source but they are most likely the Western Sources you speak of like this I just remember that there were some church members who he had asked to join him believing that in a similiar manner to the biblical tale of trumpets toppling the walls of Jerhico the spread of the word of god would topple the regime. Here is another article that is more specific to his intent inside NK.What he was thinking of I have no clue. I dont want to offend anyone but his arrogance in thinking that not only is his god the real one but it will actually bring down the regime by a couple of missionaries clandestinely proselytizing NK citizens is naive at best. Its the same thinking that has people sending balloons with bibles in them over the DMZ because the problem in North Korea is not a lack of food.What a way to help someone...float some bibles to you and tell you to stop blindly worshipping Kim and start blindly worshipping the god I believe in. Someone in NK may be desperate enough to pick up the contents of these balloons sent over even though they face harsh consequences if caught hoping for some money or rice or anything helpful and all they get is a damn bible.,northkorea,cf4p7px,2,t5_2r16c

If I were him I would realize that. But hes young. I think the theory advanced by many that he is just a puppet of the OGD is probably true. His narcissistic father put him in that position. I think KJE is just a figurehead a target of blame. That kind of phony front setup is the norm under totalitarianism. The real leadership structure is always a state secret. From what I have read numerous assassination attempts were made against Kim Jong Il and probably thousands of people paid with their lives for them. We just dont hear about it.

But nobody wants to see lots of people get killed either.I think it would also be far preferable for the purpose of closure for the millions whose lives were ruined by the regime in various ways if those responsible could be brought before an international court of justice like Slobodan Milosevich was Of course Kim Jong Il is dead however Kim JongUn appears to be continuing the family traditions.

Most of the locals we met were I guess you could say shy. One girl wanted to take her picture with some kids but they all said no. A European guy bought candy to give to kids out to kids but one kid told his mom who did not look happy and a group of kids wouldnt take any candy until one of our tour guides gave it to them. We did meet some friendly locals but most of our interactions with them were short. Plus I cant speak Korean and I dont think most people on the street can speak English so I cant really have an in depth conversation with them. I actually think your best bet to get to know North Koreans is to get to know your tour guides and hotel staff. Sometimes they will give you stock answers to your questions but other times theyll give genuine responses.

Who knows.Ive known about this story for awhile mostly because Im also a mormonBYU alum but it hadnt been picked up in the media because there just wasnt any evidence one way or the other.

U.S. officials say Chinese officials think hes dead we have no evidence one way or the other we cant really help you... Well now all this attention based on informed sources is leading to a formal search for him in NK by the Dept of State.Conspiracy hat could be maybe its generated to drum up more attention to the kidnapping issue which many Japanese have been trying to do for awhile or by the students loved ones because they honestly believe hes in NK.
