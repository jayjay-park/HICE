181892,0,t1_cez5f5k,Also I forgot to add... one thing that I can definitely agree with you on is the terrible withdrawals of the methadone. Never will I EVER want to go through that again. If Ray jumped off from mg... wow. I have no words for this because that is a feat in itself. Im not glorifying this... just really cannot find a good word to describe how I feel.. I want to probably say... Damn the man is crazy... I missed one dose at mg and I wanted to just crawl up and wished for death to come my way quickly and mercifully. Dramatic? Yes. But it was the thought that ran in my mind. But tapering off it which is what the treatment plan is meant for is much more merciful and doable. ,Methadone,cez5kbs,1,t5_2sz9e

3687675,0,t1_cqacf7l,Thank you for explaining to her what she was reading. I would never start a methadone support group to sell products to people  years later after I spent thousands of unpaid hours of time over the past years helping every single person I could on this sub.

3840430,0,t1_cqtwfw4,Thank you this is exactly how I feel.  Ive been going up and up because my counselor lushes me even though I was fine at a much lower.dose!  To be honest at first I was seeking a glow.  But now I am not and Im still going up because she keeps making me feel like I should.  Im over medicated at this point.  I feel like maybe she could be pushing all her patients into it not just me.  Which is making me feel like shes doing it to keep people on Methadone for a long time and its about the money for the clinic.  I dont want to say that if its bit true but it feels that way.  I mean I have been on Methadone before and my counselor back then wasnt like this at all and I was fine.  ,Methadone,cqu1jpf,1,t5_2sz9e

Can you give me a rough timeline of what you were doing and dealing with during the first  days? Im sooo intrigued by this that I wish you had a camera set up vlog style so I could see how bad the withdrawal truly is.

7250644,0,t1_d21y8gt,I am glad you found inspiration to make a decision that is right for you. Getting off of MMT for many people isnt a walk in the park but the effects can be reduced if done slowly and with the proper supports in place.In my experience Id say perhaps one out of twenty people approach their transition from treatment properly. It is so vital that it is not a rushed decision and for a person to be fully educated about the days to come.At any rate I am happy to hear that you are feeling like yourself again. I always try to encourage people to remember they will get out of treatment what they put into it.Best wishes ,Methadone,d22chbf,2,t5_2sz9e

7684918,0,t1_d3fn4uz,Exactly. Methadone should be hooked to a computer too to prevent this shit I dont know what the law is on that but the pump you described can be connected to a methadone dispensing program in the computer. The only time Ive seen those pumps used manually is when the power is out or the computer is down. Maybe its time he upgraded.,Methadone,d3fq7km,1,t5_2sz9e

8680198,0,t1_d6pt24d,Mine used to run similar to yours until this year when they implemented a computer system and a lot of changes.Now you walk in and up to a tablet where you log in with a fingerprint. It brings up your account which will show anything pending or if you have anything like a UA that has to be tended to before you can log in that day. If you have no blocks you tap check in. This puts you into a queue where your ID number is shown on several monitors throughout the building. Theres two monitors in the waiting area with chairs and then one in the back room with the tablets. When you number comes up it announces say  to window  and you go up pay dose etc. Cards used to be taken seperately in an office where you got a receipt to give the window but now they take cards at the window. Wait time from log in can be  seconds to  minutes it depends on the queue which depends on the time. Dont come when everyones trying to get to work right when the buses show up or right before close and you should wait under minutes. Orlando FL.,Methadone,d6qnd5r,1,t5_2sz9e
8699940,0,t3_4z4e23,Youre setting yourself up for failure if you try to use methadone like that. It wasnt designed to be an on and off quick fix to heroin or opiate addiction. There is no such thing because of the damage thats been done to an addicts brain. It needs time to heal  but luckily in a lot of cases it does heal.I felt exactly like you but was tired of my life being the constant up and down it has been for the last decade . So I decided to say fuck it and try the maintenance program with the internal agreement that I would taper off immediately after stabilizing. Then my life started to piece together slowly money stopped running through my fingers like water and while its still on the shit side of the stick Im relearning how to live without dealers and without using instant gratification to solve all of lifes struggles.Hopefully sooner rather than later youll realize that you have an addiction issue. Not just a physical one but a mental one. Depending on how long youve been using there is a very strong chance that your brain has been chemically altered to depend on instant gratification. Even when the withdrawals are over your natural ability to handle stress is gone.  Which is why so many of us are able to get clean for a while I was clean for a year  but then life will happen someone will die for example and somehow almost like fucking magic we will find ourselves back at square one.You need to treat the addict part of yourself and give yourself time to heal. Give your brain time to heal.. It can take years sometimes. But if you take the long hard road youll be better for it on the other side. This is exactly why methadone is so successful so long as you follow the treatment plan. What is  years in comparison to the rest of your life? Just saying. Methadone allows you to take the worst of your life by the horns and fuck it until its straight again.. The worst my life had ever gotten was  month into maintenance when all the fuck ups I had achieved while oblivious on opiates came crashing down on me at once. That was the hardest  months of my life and ironically the most I had ever wanted to use in my life so far even tho using is what put me in that position. Its fucked up.But methadone and therapy and groups gave me the strength to see it through without using. Im working on tapering down now and its been  months but once you get in it goes by fast. Mostly because the rest of life turns into a shit storm. Hope this helps.,Methadone,d6t4hni,5,t5_2sz9e

9280051,0,t1_d8s5w1c,I know at my clinic you specifically have to ask to have have them send the sample off for the extra testing and it costs like  bucks.  Im sure its not the same everywhere  if this was like two weeks ago I doubt they still have your sample but thats just a guess  I really have no idea.  I doubt they would do anything for THC though  my clinic in the southeast definately not a legal or even medical state for weed does doesnt even test for THC.  If you havent gotten in trouble before and you have the backing of the doc I doubt anything will come of it.  Regardless I wish you luck.  Keep us informed!,Methadone,d8sbad9,2,t5_2sz9e
9583261,0,t3_52jxfm,I just want to point out one thing here even though this post is a month old..At the expense of sounding like a nagging parent those on methadone medication should not be drinking any amount of alcohol. The reason for this is due to the effects of methadone on the heart and breathing regulation centers of the brain something alcohol does as well. Essentially combining the two can result in unconsciousness followed by cessation of breathing.That being said ordinarily alcohol leaves the body rather quickly compared to just about every other substance. If someone went out drinking the night before being tested it may show up. Itd be easier to detect via blood testing or using a breathalyzer.In any case our clinic has postings everywhere discouraging alcohol use in any amounts due to the high risk of fatality.Best wishes.,Methadone,d9ubz4g,1,t5_2sz9e
10363885,0,t3_5oeirj,I completely understand that suboxone works better for some people. Although I agree with umarkatl.

10766065,0,t3_5tlp5q,Im going to respond here to the best of my ability and also address some of the other comments listed so please bare with me.All clinics have a patient rights and responsibilities policy since these are established by whichever company owns the clinic. Additionally there should be a patient handbook of some form that can be provided to you at request. All things may not be inclusive but enough information should be available so you know what your rights are.Now.. being dismissed from treatment against your will is certainly something the clinic may do. From my experience this is way harder than it seems because we work with a high risk population discharge from treatment could lead to death via overdose on street heroinfentanylpinketc. Ordinarily discharge is something not taken lightly and all other avenues of intervention are to be exhausted before taking this step. Two things will lead to immediate termination however and these are violence on clinic grounds and attempted diversion of medication. If you feel you are being terminated for absolutely NO reason contact your state methadone authority.Addressing some of the other comments Ive read here..Yes clinics can dismiss you from treatment for failed drug tests and they will vary in the policies. The aim is harm reduction but there is a limit to using this as an excuse to use other drugs. Let me provide an example.Patient John Doe has been using cocaine and has tested positive for two months in a row. He is placed on a behavioral contract for  days understanding that we need to see improvement ieeither cessation of use OR reduction of cocaine levels in the urine or he risks termination from treatment. Also it is explained that cocaine a depletes his methadone and b exacerbates addiction to opiates by creating more receptor sites in the brain. On top of that those prone to depression are often at particular risk because of the way cocaine interacts with chemicals in the brain. John doesnt care and states Im here for opiate use not cocaine. Fair enough but what John doesnt understand is that this is not harm reduction if we do nothing about his rampant cocaine use. In fact we may be causing more harm because if he stops his cocaine use then we may end up overmedicating him now that the methadone is not being depleted by the cocaine.At the end of the day it will be each individual clinic and policies they operate by that decide how far is too far in terms of polysubstance use. Generally speaking cannabis is the least of all worries and it just gets worse from there. Weve never terminated anyone for smoking pot but people get discharged all the time because of cocaine use.Treatment is voluntary and can therefore be terminated by either the patient or clinic although I dont know of any clinic that would do so without any reason whatsoever. If it is a retaliatory reason then I would place a call to HR and if you get nowhere then call the methadone authority. That would be improper patient care as far as I can tell.Lastly and I dont want to be that guy but Im going to say it..We cater to a very diverse population. Some people are underprivileged and some are not. Ive had an assistant district attorney on my caseload and business owners. Ive also had homeless people and single mothers. A variety. Often it has nothing to do with not understanding their rights or what is expected of them. Human beings are human beings. We tend to take what we want and sweep the rest under the rug. Before you interject let me finish.Often times folks come into treatment because the methadone will make them feel better. Everything else clinic requirements the inconvenience of treatment the drug screens the counseling is not really taken into consideration and exists as an afterthought if at all. Sometimes folks completely disregard the state requirements in place that guide the operation of a clinic and only want the medication. When they dont pay attention they hit a wall with one violation or another then are shocked that no one told them anything. Often they have been told.. at orientation intakeadmission take home education group.. somewhere. They just dont bother to pay attention because its filler and not interesting.Now Im not saying this is everyone. Im also not blaming patients because I know there are terrible counselors and support staff out there. What Im trying to convey is responsibility on the part of everyone involved in a persons treatment from the clinic to the patient. Part of the issue is incredibly high case loads for counselors and minimal resources for ongoing support AFTER methadone treatment.Bottom line is if a person doesnt know what is going on with their treatment or clinic its on them.Best wishes to everyone.,Methadone,ddqfucz,3,t5_2sz9e
