177197,0,t3_1w38zj,it cant be as simple as hes not a good coach and he hates jeremy lin.i will concede that patrick beverley shouldnt have been in on that final play but as for lin starting over beverley i would argue that patrick brings intensity and defensive prowess that lin will never have. lin brings something off the bench that we dont have a scorer. garcia and casspi have been awful this year and i think thats part of the reason lin comes off the bench. bringing patrick off the bench gives you little to no offensive spark and lin at least can manage to handle the load for the few minutes harden is off the court. so until we either trade asik for a true bench scorer thats lins job. and as much as i like jeremy lin and personally would like to see him succeed thats his role for now. our team truly lacks a th man and thats not mchales fault. not at all. lin is doing the best he can in that limited role for now. my main gripe with coach mchale is that he lets harden play hero ball too much as i believe we should be pick and rolling everyone to death. a dwight howard and james harden pick and roll should be damn near unguardable. few teams have the pair of players needed to efficiently shut that down. i dont blame this loss on mchale one bit. our turnovers have been down lately weve been playing more engaged on defense and were a much more fluid team than we were at the beginning of the year. who do you attribute that to if not mchale? i dont think mchale is the perfect coach but i dont think hes as bad as some of you are making him out to be. ,rockets,ceym88a,2,t5_2rnac

People like to think we did well against the Thunder in last years playoff series but they forget the severe ass whooping we took in those first two games before Westbrook was injured. All that can be attributed to our lack of a consistent system.

We run a freestyle offense that ultimately requires our players to develop an understanding and chemistry that they have only scratched the surface of.  It is the players who dial up the ISO sets more often than not.  McHale prefers player accountability to being the puppet master who pulls every string.  Its just a different approach that takes time to blossom.Weak defensive mindset?  Im not exactly sure what this means...are you implying he doesnt like defense?  That he doesnt coach it well?  Is he not shouting enough?Count me as one who will defend himnot because I think he is perfect and great and has no faults.  That would be entirely ignorant.  No I defend against weak reasoning that only serves to uphold an opinion that is not founded in fact nor logic rather it is entirely emotional.Sadly your statement that he will not take us to the promised land is more likely to come true than not.  I do not consider that an indictment of Mchales coaching although I have no doubt you will add it to your pile of reasons he is no good.,rockets,ci3n0sb,2,t5_2rnac

I wish he had more left in him but he shouldnt even have been on the Spurs.  Im sure you knew he hadnt played so how on earth would you think even hypothetically signing McGrady would make the Rockets a title favorite?  Seriously Im curious.edit With that I still would say if he got his knees fixed a la kobegermany and worked his ass off and got in shape and he still had it I wouldnt be opposed to giving him a shot with a  day contract or something.  But if hes not going to put in any real work to get him in NBA shape then he can just have a Coke and a smile and ....   but aint gonna lie if he got NBA ready Id love to have him and see him in a Rockets uniform.,rockets,cmqo7cv,2,t5_2rnac

3147687,0,t1_coo82hv,Agreed.  Morey stepped into a team capstrapped and tied to  stars whose bodies were done.  He was not allowed to tank and get sweet draft picks for an easy rebuild.  He didnt get lucky like OKCGSW and have top  talent fall in their laps because other GMs are imbeciles looking at you David Kahn and Kevin Pritchard.  He has had to wheel and deal his way to being the  team in the WC with arguably two of the best players at their respective positions a slew of assets retained in the process the real magic no? and the ability to continue addinggrowing down the road.Is he infallible?  Of course not but to nitpick our flawed roster misses the mark in so many ways.  Every team has a flawed roster if you look closely enough.Further watch as the young teams scramble to remain on top as the reality of cap restraints and resigning all their youth proves impossible.  This team is set to be championship competitive both now and into the future and didnt need the TV Deal Bail Out to do it.  Many GMs jobs were saved by the new TV dealdont forget that.The team is not perfect but all that matters is what happens come playoff time.

3206564,0,t1_cou926v,Well sure I think wed need to make changes to the gameplan.  But still regardless of the Dwight situation weve got arguably one of the top  players in the NBA locked up in the prime of his career and he doesnt seem likely to jump ship after this contract unless things REALLY go south.  Just from that alone were a step above most NBA teams.So even in the worst case with Dwight I dont think were a sunk ship...  I think its more like Morey would have to go back to the drawing board in terms of acquiring a second star.  And who knows it could even be a guy we already have like DMo who continues to evolve.Hopefully Dwight is fine though and that doesnt end up being the case.EDIT I want to add also that may be the reason why Morey is prizing flexibility so much and not going allin on depth by pushing in his chips for a guy like Dragic.  His thought process may be longer term like he doesnt know yet how Dwights injury situation will play out so he HAS to keep his options open for adding another star player to back up Harden.,rockets,coucy1c,1,t5_2rnac

3493378,0,t3_309z0v,whats up man. we have some bucks flair on this sub  options actually you should check it out. ill try to answer your questions but im no expert. most of this is going to be based around my personal opinion as an avid rockets fan who has not missed many games this year.gtgt . Can the Rockets make the finals without P Bev?Yes. Pat Beverleys offense will not be missed as he had a tendency to miss a lot of open s. While Jason Terry and Pablo Prigoni arent the scariest options at PG I believe they can be the worst player in your starting  if you were to make a championship run. Terry will get the start but I expect Priggy smalls to get the same amount of minutes overall. That being said the sooner we get Bev back the better if he even plays again this season as defense is invaluable come playoff time.gtgt. How effective does D have to be in the playoffs for the Rockets to make it out of the West?You remember that series against Portland last year? About that effective. While that may be asking a lot for Dwight he should be pretty fresh as he hasnt played in a few months. If Harden were to hit a wall in the playoffs like he did last year Howard needs to be able to carry this team as a  option. Defensively nobody is worried as he looked good on defense even when injured this year.gtgt. Can James Harden carry this team without either of those guys or one of them?With Howard and without Bev? Yes it can be done. Without Bev AND Howard? Id say theres no chance of us sniffing the WCF if Howard is sidelined for the playoffs theres no reason he should be though.gtgt. Can the Rockets compete with the depth of a team like the Golden State?No Golden State is an overall better team than the Rockets. The Rockets if matched up with Golden State in the playoffs will have to rely on very few if not  bad games from Harden coupled with consistent bench play from Brewer Smith and Terry in each game of the series. The Rockets starters like to dig the team into a hole that the bench usually fills up quickly but against the Warriors I dont think our bench can close a  point deficit.gtgt. How do the Rockets matchup with the teams in the West and who are the worstbest matchups for them?The best matchup would either be Portland or Dallas. Its looking like Portland is going to be locked into that th seed so I dont see that happening. Dallas would be our best bet at moving past the st round...and also fuck Dallas.The lukewarm matchups would be the Spurs the Clippers and injured OKC. We actually consistently beat the Spurs in the regular season but I never want to play a Greg Poppovich team in the playoffs.On the other hand the Clippers have had our number in the regular season but I personally think we can beat them in a  game series. An injured OKC still scares the shit out of me even with no Durant.The bad matchups would be the Grizzlies and the Warriors. The Grizzlies play excellent defense without fouling and the Warriors are just a beast of a team right now. If the Rockets are going to make a serious run this year then they will have to cross one of these teams most likely both.,rockets,cpqgxkc,23,t5_2rnac

Even with his age Dirk could give our s trouble and they have decent depth.SA  I feel that we matchup well here but Leonard will give Harden problems and other guys might have to step up.

It made sense for him to waive it to resign him to a longer term deal before we inevitably go over the cap with the DMO extension and Howard extension. We pretty much only have this offseason and next to work together a really deep core because were going to be locked in cap for a few years probablyanything can happen but as it sits.Yeah we can go over the cap for up to .myr on his next contract which I dont think he gets more than that unless there is a really desperate team with Cap to throw. Maybe theres a number under that .m though that Morey wont go over because hes trying to mash numbers under the cap to try to bring on a rd star while keeping the same depth. The only way he walks is one of  reasons he wants out of HOU for whatever reasonleast likely he gets an insane offer from a desperate team or Morey wont go over myr and someone offers him a bit more. ,rockets,crgdmaf,0,t5_2rnac

Hes pretty good with his right hand down low but his left leaves something to be desired. Can obviously jump through the roof and has elite athleticism. If he were more willing to run pick and rolls and develop an actual post game with both hands should have been done  years ago honestly he would be insane. Alas I love him and what he brings.

4183622,0,t1_crx44fg,gt Yes you specifically said let Smith take the corners because he sucks at them anyway. The fact you consider TT as the ideal choice beside Dwight is laughable. TT is a rebounding machine but you wouldnt understate spacing issues until you see them play. TT cant score from over  ft out just like Dwight. RIP Spacing.Except TT is the type of guy who doesnt need the ball and can still make an impact on offense. He can score even if you dont involve him at all on the half court sets. He gets you extra possessions you dont otherwise have. Yes theres spacing issues but hey that got Cavs into the Finals so clearly his positives outweigh the negatives.? I never said Josh sucks at corners. I specifically said that hes IIRC  from one of the corners near the end of the year and  in the playoffs albeit inconsistent. Lets not forget that DMo started off the year  so its not like he has a large sample size of  shooting either.gt O I dont know? So Ariza and Dwight can be set in half court for defense? Maybe the fact that you play to your teams strengths and the nd unit is pure transition. Llull is built for transition. Its basically all Brewer can do. K.J. isnt a slouch in itAssuming he stays once again.And with DMo in the nd unit you still have that transition game but if the game slows down you still have a solid half court option. Teams arent just going to let you run out every single possession. Look at our current nd unit we have a lot of trouble scoring in the half court. DMo is too good of an offensive player to be sharing the ball with Harden new PG and even Dwight. I want him to get as many touches as possible thats only realistic when hes with the nd unit and let the offense run through him.gt Also by bringing in a starting PG youre wanting to address the turnover issue. So why in the hell do you take the ball out of the new PG or Hardens and put it in Smiths?I never said Id rather Smith have it but you mentioned that Josh on the second unit would be an asset in pushing the ball Im pointing out that hes also an asset on the first unit pushing the ball. If you have concerns with Josh turning the ball over then why do you want him handling it on the second unit.,rockets,crx4wle,1,t5_2rnac

The gap is closing on us having a good shot at the  seed still. A week or so ago I made the point that some of the teams that were preseason favorites Thunder Clippers Grizzlies we were only a few games ahead of us. But now the Thunder are creeping ahead and the ClippersGrizzlies are gaining a game here and there.

6425697,0,t1_czjxto4,Leuer? Hes been getting major minutes and starting for almost two month until he got hurt a week ago. Im not sure what makes you think hes been playing garbage time since November. Over the season hes averaging over min in GP and most of that is dragged down by the limited minutes he got earlier in the year.I dont like Leuer but I like him more than TJones and hes a realistic target who wont cost the moon unlike big names like Anderson Teague etc. etc. Not really sure why you think more playmakers is the priority in fact if anything defense should be. Would more playmakers be nice? Sure. But I dont know where you plan on finding playmakers halfway into the season with rostercapasset available consideration and the fact that Harden is going to have the ball  of the time anyways so that playmaker has to be a great spot up shooter as well. A playmaker makes a negligible difference if thats his only skill given that Harden will have the ball most of the time anyways.,rockets,czjyd47,1,t5_2rnac

I personally dont think he is the answer for us but for the sake of conversation. If Houston trades us Howard who do we give back?On the Celtics sub people seem to think David Lee Tyler Zeller and the Mavs st round pick is a fair trade. I personally dont think it is enough for Howard even if he may be a rental. Where would your fans see this trade go if anywhere? Every fan base overrates its assets and players so it is always interesting to hear an outside opinion on it all.PS Hope you guys turn it around soon if not this year than next in the mean time Ill keep rooting for you guys as the Rockets are my favorite west cost team outside of the Spurs.,rockets,cznd6ce,1,t5_2rnac

Dwight is old and needs to play in a slower system with a good head coach. The rockets are better when they play fast. Hopefully he and the rockets can make a decent playoff run before he leaves.

Perhaps JVG but theyd need to get rid of Morey and give JVG full control.Youd need get rid of Ariza and Brewers salaries since they both would get limited minutes if KD goes over. Youd also have to sign another piece such as Horford to draw Durants interest. Harden probably wouldnt be enough.OKC currently has Westbrook Ibaka Kanter Adams and Waiters. All are young pieces that can still develop into stars in their own right.I think Durant signs a  year contract.

9785884,0,t1_daj7yvh,hey man trust me if we just ended up dishing Capela for Cousins and didnt lose anything too significant you wont really hear me bitch or complain tooo much. But damn. Capela and Harden make eachother better. Harden iq so high he knows exactly what needs to be done to score. Thats how good he is. He knows how to score or how to get someone else to score. That someone else needs to be on the same page as him though. At  years old he has bought in. In my opinion that is invaluable. For a player to buy in and sacrifice ego and everything for the system. I mean shit we are seeing the benefits. however... im not gunna be an idiot and ignore the benefits if we had Cousins. lol there will be NO camping by any defense. They have to respect   point shooters from the jump. Harden would long dick any defense because of that. And if they dont Cousins will roll and more than likely get other bigs in foul trouble or just simply eat. Hes a beast for sure. Hes so good. But man everyone is  cool with their role right now. People underestimate the power of a positive attitude from our entire team going into each game. If you love what youre doing and the people around you set u up to succeed and trust your ability you are going to exceed what anyone including yourselfs expectations of what you will bring to the table. These dudes are geln n i love it lol But yes Cousins is undeniably a great piece and would probably beast here as well. But who knows. I guess you could say im happy af either way. ,rockets,dajbnet,5,t5_2rnac

At the end of the day DMo is a rotation player and wont move the needle too much hell help this team but is replaceable so its about losing a little bit now to swing at something unrealistic which if happens can turn your franchise around.According to the Vertical DMos contract is not guaranteed the final  years not just  theres no downside in matching. ,rockets,daq4hkx,1,t5_2rnac

10161809,0,t3_5lhwwz,st of all i wish your family nothing but the best going forward.I have always seen Harden have the ability to get guys open. But now hes dishing it to guys that can knock the  down instead of bricks lol. Howards lack of willingless to relentlessly run the pnr killed our flow sometimes. We have bigs right now that are  willing to get out there and set picks and roll or pop to where they need to be. Nobody is standing there with their hand out wanting the ball so they can go alone. It just flows. I think Harden needed to be alone as far as star power too i guess if im saying that right. I thinik we operate better when the entire squad is completely aware that this is Hardens team. Everyone is willing to play a role that makes Hardens life on the court much easier and it pays dividends for everyoneEVERYONE being on the same page helps too. We have a GM coach and superstar who all want to play basketball the exact same way.The younger guys see that and they are willing to give everything for the greater good. When i see these other guys running around the court you can just tell that they are aware if they get to the right spots in the offense James will damn near always find the open man. Hes got that sauce to his game too so he gets the guys on the bench hyped and everyone in the arena hyped. These guys already love basketball but to see it played on a level like this now you can tell they are all loving it. Its been really beautiful to see things kind of come together. I still think they can get even better. ,rockets,dbvwbgt,18,t5_2rnac

10630675,0,t1_ddcandh,One of the reasons is that Capela is really the best PampR threat we have... and with him being out with injury and just starting to come back and hes had a few good games now that hes working back into shape again. Now that hes fully healthy that aspect of the game will be stronger. Nene and Harrel are solid but they arent the threat to score on the alleyoop the way Capela is. So teams can actually double the screen to get the ball out of his hands. Then have the defender guarding the weak side corner come over to stop NeneHarrel and basically they would have to be rotating before the ball comes out of Hardens hands. And so the pass can get to Nene but he still has to get around a defender... which is doable but not the  shot that it was with Capela.Granted... defending the pick that way takes really good timing and you still leave a  pointer open. But all you have to do is be able to contest that st  point shot and then its a matter of the defense being able to scramble and cover whoever they end up passing it to.  But a lot of teams have figured out that this is what the Rockets like to do. ,rockets,ddch1qd,3,t5_2rnac

10777458,0,t1_ddqx1tn,Really enjoyed that thanks. Never knew James Harden and Westbrook were childhood friends but I guess both growing up in southern California and playing basketball it would have been inevitable hahaHeres a quote in an article from James  Thats my brother from childhood Harden told reporters. Weve grown up together. Weve grown up into some great young men. Obviously hes a great player. He got another tripledouble tonight. Hes a great competitor. So every time we go against each other its going to be a great battle.  Pretty awesome how now they are both competing for league MVP.Also as a side note everyone always made it seem like Harden and Durant were closer friends when Harden left OKC but maybe Harden and Westbrook were actually closer. I mean check out Hardens Instagram post with Russel Westbrook after Houston and OKC played together. Harden never posted a pic of him and Durant after the game versus GSW.

11047540,0,t3_5xq8hx,His defensive rebounding numbers arent great compared to Nene or Capella. Given the Rockets trouble with rebounding lately I suspect MDAs holding Harrell out because of that.Harrell would have more of a place if the Rockets ran more traditional lineups where he and Capella could play together but the Rockets prefer to play smaller lineups and stretch the floor. So the problem is that if he plays as a center the Rockets will have significant rebounding issues but if he plays as a four the Rockets wont be able to shoot as many threes.Hes good though. If I were MDA Id probably try putting Capella and Harrell together more. But he probably knows more than I do so whatever.,rockets,dek7x0h,1,t5_2rnac

I think hes being a little underrated this season Kawhi. Most of his MVP argument is based around the Spurs winning  games. I think people just assume the Spurs are going to win  games every year. But you look at that roster and were  years removed from Tim Duncan playing at allstar level. Yet... they keep racking up wins so at some point Kawhi has to factor into the current team winning. I was always antiKawhi but I couched my argument in the fact that up until this season he averaged like  points a game and had high efficiency but didnt shoot the ball often enough. But now that hes averaging like  a game and still with decent efficiency I can get behind him being an MVP candidate. ,rockets,dftmay7,4,t5_2rnac

11668837,0,t3_66i9nv,Giving up  points in the first half is no bueno.If this were the Dubs they wouldve gone for  against that kind of defensive effort.Missing all those shots contributed to it of course.I think that in future games we should plan to. Make more buckets. Stop the other team from getting so many buckets.If we can follow this plan Id expect to have an easier time winning.It is nice to see this team has no quit in it though.Also happy to see Harden pushing into the paint when he couldnt hit from outside not just him getting to the line... Getting Adams in foul trouble was HUGE.Ryno tried this once or twice but seemed scared to even touch the ball at times. Hopefully Road Ryno will emerge and then become Playoff Ryno.Lou should have gotten some of his minutes though. He was balling and potentially saved the game for us when it was in serious danger of getting out of hand.We are overall lucky to be going against a coach who is doing a horrible job with his rotations. Donovan reminded me of JB. Glad we have a good guy on our sideline. This advantage will only hold up in this round though and whoever we meet in the Finals!Im super sad we didnt have Bev  years ago.We could have beat the Dubs if this Pat were available in those WCF.Total beast.,rockets,dgiofgm,8,t5_2rnac
