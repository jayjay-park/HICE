Homecare units are being targeted because they have been a huge area of growth for unions like SEIU and AFSCME over the past decade.I wish people could put aside their hated and fear of the word union and focus on the fact that theyre not stuck making  an hour like homecare workers in RTW states often are.,labor,ceudgal,1,t5_2qn0s

The current political leaders and a antilabor lawyer are spearheading changes in the way fire departments police departments and other municipal unions operate. We went from a  hour work week with  groups of guys working to a  hour work week with only  groups of guys working. And on top of that they increased our hours by  while reducing our pay by  and changing our shifts health care and other benefits.

4721551,0,t1_ctpe3ug,They have been endorsing it for a long time they have simply had to deal with politics beyond their control.National healthcare came close under Truman. What killed it was the Southern Democrats who did not like the provision that hospitals would have to be integrated. Variations of arguments played on fears that health care would lead to rationing during that time and employer based health care in the US is an accident of World War II wage controls where health care was a perk offered when wages couldnt be raised. The US has been slow to adopt it but as bad as the fight to Obamacare was I think history will show it as the intermediate step that leads to universal single payer care that transfers health from a commodity to a human right in the US,labor,ctpovsd,1,t5_2qn0s

6058581,1,t1_cydlnh3,I agree with uteamerchant. This is why Unions have a bad name. It is one thing to fight for worker rights and make sure they get a decent wage but it is another to try and fuck the company because people cannot plan. Are you telling me that they planned a wedding a honeymoon and everything thing it takes in only  weeks? They could not wait a month or two? What was the freaking hurry even if you did a J.P.

When you said fragmented the Pavlovian conditioning in my brain immediately brought up deskilling and the ghost of Taylor. But that wasnt what you nor the author were focusing on. I had to reread the essay to grasp that. Im presently agnostic about the matter as the piece had no footnotes so its hard to get an idea of what he bases his claim on.
