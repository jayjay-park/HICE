1014377,0,t1_chjl5sz,I will try this. Thank you for the help. I realize my post is incredibly broad but so is my search range. Anything with a cool or wacky design on it would be great really. Maybe an interesting black and white floral design or some kind of complex pattern. I realize I may be asking a lot of you but any help would be appreciated!,hats,chjlbfa,2,t5_2qm2k

6455417,0,t3_441496,What size do you wear? Im a small dude  and wear  fifty and dont have a problem with them being too tall. Once they kind of break in they seem to fit lower than when theyre brand new. I have a little bit of space between the top of my hats and my head. ,hats,czn16q9,1,t5_2qm2k
6681920,0,t3_4730x5,Youre looking at an AFrame Snapback cap. Hard to change the shape of it considering how it is stitched together at the crown. The crown is the peak of the hat. It is also difficult because the two front panels of the cap are made of thick material in order for it to keep that high crown shape. The one you are comparing it to is a completely different style of cap than the first a nonstructured trucker cap. It is not impossible to change the shape however it involves a ton of wear and tear which would likely change the colour and make the cap look very old. Youre better off buying the style of the second cap if that is how you want it to look. New Era does make baseball caps in that style even fitteds they are called low crown caps and they come precurved. Hope this helps.Edit Typed on my phone and made a few mistakes. ,hats,d0agwcb,2,t5_2qm2k
