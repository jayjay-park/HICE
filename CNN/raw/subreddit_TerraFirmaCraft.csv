599021,0,t1_cg891ar,If we could get a few more people to express interest in joining I could set the server up and put together a list of mod download links to post here with installation instructions to make it easier for people to put this together on their end.Ill probably go ahead and get all this set up and running anyway so that way I can get started finding a few nice settlement locations. My idea is to have people work together to build a nice little town but ultimately my goal would be to have everyone chip in and work towards building a nice huge castlevillage. I was hoping that Dunk and Bioxx would release b soon and we could start with that but Im just as happy using b if  isnt immediately forthcoming.,TerraFirmaCraft,cg8d1sn,1,t5_2v6ws

933754,0,t1_chac80s,Are you able to place more than  straw in the kiln? If you are you may actually be in TFC . where the kiln worked differently.I notice you have Reis Minimap. The one uptodate TFC pack on the technic launcher uses Mapwriter not Reis. There are many outdated TFC packs on there.On your main menu what version of Minecraft and what version of Forge is it using?If it is TFC . it will be on MC ...TFC .. uses MC ..,TerraFirmaCraft,chaf83z,1,t5_2v6ws
1008436,0,t1_chiibk5,Ok I was doing to do a glass roof about  blocks above the water.  I use the water as a way of accessing my crops easier but also have a dirt walkway on the other side.  My main reason for settling where I did is the amount of resources its close to a extreme high hills biome that almost works as a mountain range and has both abundant surface copper and also some close to surface hematite amp gold plus theres a huge range of willow trees for logging not too far away  trees amp Ive got  stacks of logs.,TerraFirmaCraft,chix0r0,1,t5_2v6ws

1624893,0,t3_2cxalq,you can go in to the jar file and remove or replace the sound files if you want to get rid of them afaik there is nothing in the mod verifying integrity of the sound tracks so you could rename standard MC music to match and swap it in,TerraFirmaCraft,cjjzeos,2,t5_2v6ws
1681860,0,t3_2di6si,That would be an interesting option to start a game with no item names.

2790978,0,t3_2s1lhv,You can obtain flux from Chalk Dolomite Limestone or Marble rocks or from the mineral Borax which only spawns in Rock Salt.Chalk Dolomite Limestone and Rock Salt are all sedimentary stones meaning that they can only spawn in the top of the three stone layers. Marble is a metamorphic stone so it can be found in both the top and the middle stone layers.These rocks and rock salt are no different than any other rock in world generation. All stone layers are essentially biomesized. Keep in mind however that because they spawn just like any other rock they are competing with every other rock each time you come across a new stone layer. So since there are  fluxstones and a total of  different rock types that means that as you are exploring each new surface stone layer is generated has a  out of  or roughly  chance of being made of fluxstone. However since all the rock layers are generally the same size no matter what stone they are made of once you find a fluxstone layer you will likely never ever run out of fluxstone again. The same thing goes for rock salt.Long story short the best and only advice that can be given for finding a flux source is to just keep walking. If you dont explore and generate new terrain and come across new rock biomes then there isnt a chance for you to find a new rock type. Remember that TFC is very heavy in exploration and it is not uncommon for a player to travel  blocks in one direction to find a single material that they need.TLDR Pick a direction and start walking eventually the top layer of stone will be a flux stone and youll never have to worry about getting flux again.,TerraFirmaCraft,cnlboe7,5,t5_2v6ws
