2553427,0,t1_cmrrxag,well if you intend to play on both servers you will have a dilemma. dont know how you could invest time on both servers and achieve anything. i guess both servers will be top notch for their version. Kronos for vanilla and Corecraft for TBC. you should rather decide which version of the game you want to play more are you more a vanilla dude or do you want to relive TBC ? I wouldnt be able to play actively on both cause im a very dedicated type of player and wherever i play i wanna achieve something and i wouldnt be able to do it if i played on  servers simultaneously. having said that im a vanilla guy so i will rather play Kronos. If kronos wouldnt come out id play TBC on Corecraft.,KronosWoW,cmrvboa,1,t5_32ex7

If Kronos makes it really difficult for the gold sellers to make money on Kronos then they might try to take down Kronos and hope that the playerbase from Kronos migrates to a server where they can more openly sell gold.  I guess only time will tell whether they can shut down Kronos.  My guess is that they will hold it hostage as long as the DDOS costs are low and then quit DDOS when Kronos gets some better protection against DDOS.  I am assuming that the protection that Kronos implements will make the DDOS more expensive causing them to stop.,KronosWoW,d2yut8p,2,t5_32ex7

Try deleting your WTF Folder all together then when you open the game and login again it will automatically create a new one for you with default settings.Reconfigure all of your settings in game then log out normally. Dont exit early or anything let the full time tick down if youre not in an inn.Also I recommend just getting ShaguQuest and ShaguUnitFrames ShaguKill and ShaguDismount just google ShaguQuest its the first option Shagu Addons all work perfectly with .. because they were specifically made for .. servers also I recommend SKMap along with OCB Scrolling Combat Text AtlasLoot and AtlastQuest FuBar And the PlugIns you like sRaidFrames BigWigs Boss Mods and SpartanUI. Thats how I roll and its the best UI  AddON setup   Ive ever had. If you dont like SpartanUI check out ShaguUI that ones pretty nice too.Obviously you can pick and choose from these recommendations but if theres any I suggest as MUST HAVES it would be ShaguQuest.
