3913949,0,t1_cr27qnh,Remember items you pack PBO will not be covered unless the box is extremely damaged and even then they will fight about the contents of the box. The driver will put CU which means contents unknown so if you do have something very valuable in a box that you packed make sure you leave it open for him to inspect and verify the contents before he inventories it. Make sure EVERYTHING gets inventoried as it sounds like you may not have the most reputable company doing move.. do not let them put anything on truck that is not on the inventory because it will be difficult to file a missing item claim on something that has no record of them moving. Also as far as your bed goes just take pictures of it before the move and make sure the driver doesnt put a bunch of bogus condition reports on there. Sometimes driver will put an excessive amount of damage on an item just in case something does happen to it.,movingday,cr2fbfv,2,t5_32t62
4327067,0,t1_csddwxt,Are those forearm straps? We have a piano board but its solid and we lift it onto a four wheel. Problem is lifting it up and down the ramp without scratching. Unless you have a life gate appliance is the way to go. Just lay the dolly flat on its back lift the piano onto it and center the weight. Strap it down and boom. Easiest way to move a piano I have found by far. ,movingday,csde12i,1,t5_32t62

8056333,0,t3_4ougkn,Label everything and put a number on each item they move. Then create a list with a description of what the items is with the according number. Maybe even get the lead mover to sign off on moving those items. If the movers see labels and numbers there is less chance of something missing or getting mixed in with our clients belongings.,movingday,d4llw2l,1,t5_32t62
