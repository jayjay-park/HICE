7168810,0,t1_d1sz3ex,I think you misunderstood me. It makes a lot of sense to restart when switching users. What I mean is shouldnt Slide not restart if the account clicked on is the one that is already being used? Aka there is no user switch actually happening.,slideforreddit,d1t0yjj,3,t5_37acp
7194110,0,t1_d1vs3c5,Unfortunately not because reddit doesnt allow it for third party. They made a few exclusions to this I think for reddit is fun but not for slide. You can click open externally to open the postcomment in your browser and gild it there! ,slideforreddit,d1vwtbo,1,t5_37acp

7228578,0,t1_d1zu24f,MESorry for asking so many questions. Just wanted to check a few things before buying pro. Btw the app crashed thrice when I tried to open this thread.     I did as follows go to inbox ampgt clicked on your reply ampgt loading icon appeared ampgt but I clicked load full thread before the app loaded your reply to my comment and it crashed. Same thing happened  times. gt Probably not. It downloads it as a jpg or png but saves as a PNG because those are easier to encodeThis is the biggest issue I have. Data saving is extremely necessary for me. This was on the frontpage of rall today The above image is directly downloaded from imgur. Its size is kb. I downloaded the same image from slide and its size is kb. There is a huge difference between their sizes but the quality is almost same. Thats why I said if possible make the app download and save images in .jpg format gt Well let me know when you get .. not getting any reports after .. thoughSuregt I havent gotten any other reports of this either which leads me to believe its network related I would be getting tons of reports for an issue like this. Have you tried clearing the app cache?Ill try that and report later. gt The download button does nothing until the image is loaded to keep from downloading multiple instances save answer to So theres no way to download the second image before the st one is downloaded completely? Does this mean that Ill have to waut for every image to load to download it?.... Dude I use G and G so it takes a while for each image to load. Isnt it possible to put them in a queue? gt It will load LQ until you hit the HQ buttonI dont see the HQ button in albums so do images in album always load in HQ quality? gt That would get hidden when fastscrolling then no? PIts semitransparent but it doesnt autohide when scrolling down. gtThanks for the kind words as well ,slideforreddit,d1zu33b,1,t5_37acp

7277991,0,t1_d25d5gr,Just got the update! Awesome update but some features are missing.  The inbox only shows the username of the person who replied to your comment the reply and the time when it was sent. Can you add more info like the name of the thread and option to upvotedownvote that reply?  Other apps are capable of downloading multiple images at a time also they show a download notification in the notification panel where the user can see the image download progress. This is missing from the app. You mentioned in a post that the app only saves images that are already loaded in the image viewer and that it downloads images one by one. Plus it downloads them in the .png format which takes extra space than the .jpg format of the same file. Also it downloading images in .png format consumes more data since their size is larger that their .jpg format.  Almost all other reddit app show notifications in the notification bar. This feature is missing. Keep the updates coming ,slideforreddit,d25gj9q,4,t5_37acp

8213540,0,t3_4rtwgn,Because Sync continues to load something that youve exited while Slide stops. I actually prefer what Slide does because with Sync if you decide something is too large and is a waste of data the only way to stop it from loading is to stop the app itself while with Slide you just exit the image. ,slideforreddit,d548wgq,8,t5_37acp
8245501,0,t1_d588eur,Its not Ive done hours of testing on many network types and  devices and its much faster than some apps and comparable speeds to others. No app is faster in my testing presumably because we all use the same libraries for loading data and many of us use the same wrapper library for Reddit. Also many if the reviews on the play store talk about how much faster it is than the competition and rarely are there reviews saying otherwise so if youre having speed issues try clearing the cache or app data because its most likely a device issueEdit also if youre on Android N thats causing issues for some users and they had no issues after returning to M,slideforreddit,d588rmz,4,t5_37acp

8862161,0,t1_d7d3bvg,Yes you are correct and that was the reasoning behind it also it is cached so it improves performance.And it stores the time you see the posts as you open them again to increase performance and then I store the next time you view comments after comments have loaded which leads to what youre seeing.
