6617912,0,t3_46aeve,So Saffron said in the tweets that he might try to brew something and see about testing some of the decks. That makes me pretty excited. I am thinking about getting MTGO just for getting with you all and testing.,mtgEternal,d03ukjd,1,t5_3clml
6624406,0,t1_d04inov,Again just playing devils advocate here but why exactly wouldnt it be a problem? Clear search engine visibility is important in things like this so we would at least want to think through how we can overcome possible SEO conflicts with the existing name.,mtgEternal,d04iqzm,1,t5_3clml
6636962,0,t3_46dabq,I actually think the name Renaissance is very fitting considering how the format is being brought into creation. Minds are coming together looking at the Legacy of our predecessors and giving it a Modern perspective. Maybe not the easiest name to sell but it makes perfect sense from a Vorthos standpoint. ,mtgEternal,d05th9l,1,t5_3clml
6665580,0,t1_d08q31l,Agree with this. It takes work to make a storm list without LED and I will say that it does exist. Ive seen it in action.,mtgEternal,d08s1m2,3,t5_3clml
6683232,0,t3_474p16,I think the storm deck has to look more like modern rather than the legacy version. Ad Nauseum is made a little worse due to shock lands and the deck loses LED. ,mtgEternal,d0als16,1,t5_3clml
