7894164,0,t3_4ndbdg,I too have lived in both CDA and Missoula  grew up in CDA moved to Missoula for college University of Montana and moved back for a job  years after graduation. My experiences There is a lot more to do in Missoula. The food scene music scene art scene etc. is just more dynamic and vibrant in Missoula. CDA is getting better though.  Renting a house or apartment is easier in Missoula but much more expensive. Lots of rental property in Missoula because of a high college student population but I was paying . for a studio granted a very nice studio downtown. Moving to CDA  many of the listings we saw were slummy apartment complexes but we managed to find a bedroom house in midtown for what we paid for the studio. Do not expect to move to CDA and find a nice affordable rental quickly. Along the same lines buying a house here is still affordable. We bought  sq ft. in midtown for k last summer. The market is on the rise though so if you move here and love it  start shopping.  The lake is the best part of living in CDA and the closest thing youll get to the ocean unless you live on the coast. Do not buy a boat. Make friends with people who have a boat. Living in CDA and not spending the summer on the lake is a waste. The river in Missoula is nice but its no lake. Fishing is better though. Idahoans in general wont interrogate your sexuality or your politics so its a good idea not to bring them up. Idaho is very conservative but very liveandletlive. That said  liberals and non heterocis people are definitely in the minority around here and youll almost always be outnumbered. Missoula is very liberal  almost the opposite.  Job markets in both places have their challenges. Missoula   new graduates enter the workforce every year and a large portion want to stay in Missoula. Very hard to find entrylevel jobs. A forinstance I was in sales in Missoula. I tripled my income by moving to CDA. The guy who took my job took a paycut. Lots of justpostgrads willing to work for low wages to keep living the college lifestyle. On the other hand CDAs two biggest employees are The Resort and the hospital. Granted theres lots to do for Hagadone thats not cleaning rooms or waiting tables but if youre not in the medical field servicehospitality is our biggest industry. Also CDA is very seasonal. If your job is related in any way to our tourist andor snow bird population  expect to see your hours cut and your sales drop from October to May. Costofliving is relatively low but I dont know any singleincome something couples everyone is doubleincome. Doing well with  incomes but not quite well enough to survive on one. Hope that helps. Im happy to answer additional questions. Good luck on your search for your next home!,coeurdalene,d43dm0n,2,t5_2s89r
