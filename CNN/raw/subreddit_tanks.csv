5561566,0,t3_3r9kwj,It depends on the fusing if its an airburst I think the tank will just shrug it off but if its an impact fuse the tankcrew will have a very bad day...Top armor is thinner than turret or hull fronts and the M in particular has rather thin top armor. I think that a direct hit at a high angle would almost certainly destroy one if it hits the turret top or engine deck.kg of comp B can do a lot of damage.In reality though a tank is a small target and you would have to be very lucky to hit one.,tanks,cwmgoei,2,t5_2sjyd

11566998,0,t1_dg73slp,You are correct but the Aust E. was a prototype. The Russian KV and the Aust. E were the first two tanks that were built with torsion bar suspension which were first seen on the STRV L.But up until it was standard most of the tanks used by the Germans up to the Panzer VI Tiger were produced with leaf spring. Even if some PZ III E. were used in the war they were very few between. So when you read about the experiences from these men there is a good chance they were not driving the Panzer III Ausf. E. Panzer III were meant to play a support roll along side the PZ IV. But because the Russian deployed the T  the PZ III became obsolete relatively fast. ,tanks,dg74huz,1,t5_2sjyd
