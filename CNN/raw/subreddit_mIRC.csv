You are using if  ampamp  instead of if  ampamp  in some points again I dont know if this can be done..Other than those things I cant see anything wrong with the script..,mIRC,cihh0yf,1,t5_2rinx
2212259,0,t3_2kg65z,The way you do it youre gonna start a timer that affects a local variable r with a random value each  seconds each time a person join the channel. In the end it means that when  persons will have join the channel youre gonna have  timers that affect a local r each  seconds. Also you could just keep the messages in a file and read a random line each time.What you could do is on join     if the timer message is not running...    if !timermessage        start the timer that is going to perform the action SendRandomMessage each  seconds      timer message   SendRandomMessage     alias SendRandomMessage      read reads a random line in a file according to mirc help file    msg chan readfile.txt,mIRC,cll1540,2,t5_2rinx
