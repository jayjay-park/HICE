4078691,0,t1_crktrtg,Im sure it has no noticeable impactI just started playing about  hours ago and I have a SH.I have about  hounour I gained about  hounour with a couple of  win streaks.After this I noticed a big change in the difficulty of the multiplayer mode. Even though my SH level was unchanged the bases became much harder to beat due to good base design.Im sure that honour has an impact on the base difficulty in multiplayer mode. Probably more so than SH level.EDIT on a later thought. I would need a bigger sample size to be sure. At the very least I can say that in my experience hounour does affect the difficulty regardless of SH level. ,Kingdoms,crl72t6,1,t5_2zfz7
4173736,0,t1_crw01lo,Someone in my kingdom who has less trophies than me got a SH while the highest I had was a SH so it is pretty out of whack ,Kingdoms,crw0h15,1,t5_2zfz7

4359338,0,t3_3ay4xl,Try to always dump as much gold as possible before your shield runs out. I used to save up as much as possible during the shield and pay for most expensive upgrade right before shield ends. Also I usually stop attacking  hour  min before shield runs out so i have  stones to start with right when shield refreshes. But yeah just keep climbing in honor the gold gets better and will matter less as you wait around for rings at higher levels. ,Kingdoms,csh147v,2,t5_2zfz7

4499923,0,t3_3co0od,If they dont fix this ASAP they will lose players even faster  and the depopulation already has begun. There are a lot of things they could do recalculate from day  redesign primus exchange curve with a cheaper exchange lets say till ancient lvl .... But ignoring the biggest problem of their game is definitely the worst they could do.,Kingdoms,csxvb6w,6,t5_2zfz7

4642761,0,t3_3eivnt,I leveled him from  to  the night before the nerf Literally used all pure and lightning primus on him.That was all my savings gone I never used those two primuses on any ancient before.But yeah I would still level him up hes still my favorite ancient and dragon.,Kingdoms,ctfsayk,2,t5_2zfz7
4795854,0,t1_ctywoe8,Nope. Just dragon ancients need more than normal ancients. Otherwise epic ancients need same primus as superior ancients in getting to level  for instance.,Kingdoms,ctz218s,2,t5_2zfz7
4904768,0,t3_3i2erz,I was initially getting very few rings from new arena but either the drops have been modified or picking almost exclusively hard matches influences the drops because the rings are flowing decentlyagain for me.

5263419,0,t1_cvkdq2l,Yeah I may not get the big kahuna but Ill get some battle stones a rare ancient chest probably some diamonds. All I got on the last two events were acorns and fangs that I couldnt do anything with. Sure I wish I had a reasonable chance at the possibly crappy ancient but its more engaging than just the same old multiplayer and individual tournament battles. ,Kingdoms,cvkgkl9,3,t5_2zfz7

5330334,0,t3_3o0mqv,Xolonia getting buffed slightly  why???They should buff other ancients like Kestra st and rd which are quite useless apart if attacking a sh Yalenati everything Banemaw everything Tokemi the nd which is totally useless to spell towers if I go back in time why I should still have the debuff??? Moloch the st which is crap Brandr the rd etc.Xolonia was OP and needed any tactics at all.Jal dont touch him! Yes he is powerful like a lot of other epic ancients and even not epic. He require skills and in a good layout you still have to think how to attack and victory is not garanted. If your base is crap stop whining about ancient damn it! Learn to use them and to build a good base!,Kingdoms,cvt0du4,3,t5_2zfz7
5335235,0,t3_3o2mae,Thats kinda frustrating yep. Lately I even dont use them sometimes knowing this fact.,Kingdoms,cvtmvs5,2,t5_2zfz7
5449058,0,t1_cw7vtkw,Just tried Talesin only on two bases and seems fine. I dont see any changes and Ive used him a lot before. The third spell appears to recast just fine I got the usual chain reaction. Just for fun I cast it on a smelter at  and it exploded and was recast on the adjacent building same as normal. Not completely sure it gives the bonus manna on recast I assume it does but you cant see manna on replays and I forgot to look during the attack.Tried the st shield spell a few times with manna from winning. Looks fine to me all the take less damage spells now show the same spinning shields just different shades. Radius is about  squares which feels the same as before.nd spell seems to paralyze just fine like it always did. I forgot to check if it still caused the small damage tick.I wonder if people thinking the rd doesnt recast are having it wear off. Maybe they killed stuff pretty quickly before but now are getting tougher bases. So this is the first time theyre seeing the second rule?,Kingdoms,cw864dd,2,t5_2zfz7
5730965,0,t3_3tmcmu,Its probably your Google ID. If you have ever added a credit card or made a purchase on it remembers and locks you into that region.. Make a new google Id enter location netherlands when it asks for visa hit skip. Visit google play store and add that ID.. If using on tabletphone download a vpn app I use touchvpn its free. . set location to netherlands. visit google play store and update  . turn off vpnYou will not be able to auto update the app and it tends to keep working when there is new version so you will have to check periodically if they have an update then repeat steps Fair warningIts very incomplete as a game. No events no dailies no news no active kingdoms so no wars very few players so you never get attacked so no need for defence. Only use it if you really care to see the new stuff a bit early and not everything will be added there some comes straight to RK. I add whatever new stuff to my site rk.com if you want to skip to hassle. ,Kingdoms,cx7hdcx,2,t5_2zfz7
