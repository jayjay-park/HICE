8256310,0,t1_d598oro,So you like facts dont you ?Here some facts    Beeing rd of their group Portugal would not even have passed the groups stage a couple of years ago. Im not sure the Euro will keep the  teams formula for a very long time considering this tournament  Portugal Would not even be third of the group if Austria didnt loose its last game  Lets continue  Portugal played a very defensive football but doesnt seem to realize it cf Ronaldo saying  Iceland didnt try anything they were just defend defend defend and playing on the counterattack  Payet should have get a yellow card for his fool on Ronaldo but considering it ws not intentionnal certainly not a red card.  Eder should have recieved a yellow card for his handball instead of Koscielny considering that he simulated the fact that it was Koscielnys  Moutinho shoud lhave recieved a yellow card for his simulation on Mattuidi his foot doesnt touch his face cmon  Portugal didnt win half of the games they played. How can this be possible ? How can noone from Portugal understand how its shitty ? If France had won the way Portugal did id never watch another match of them.Shall i continue ?I dont deny the fact that portugal won they did. And i think its ridiculous that some people ask to start over the final. But I dont have to like the way they smuggled themselves to the victory from the very beggining. And im jsut sick of those referee mistakes. I watched almost every games of the Champions league this year and its incredible how much games can be fucked up by bad decisions. The worst was surely Juventus  Bayern where a valid goal was refused to Juventus and at least  unvalid goals given to Bayern.Whatever you can say Juventus deserved their place that day in Quarter finals as much as the goal from Eder should not have existed if the referee had made a good call. Dont deny it thats a little in bad faith.Portugal won this tournament out of luck but they won it yes. And theyll find the return to reality very tough if they play like that in the next tournament.,Euro2016,d59lg3x,0,t5_2uby1
