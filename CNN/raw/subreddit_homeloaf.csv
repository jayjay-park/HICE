1752506,0,t1_cjzp5w7,Well looks like you just answered the question. Its incredibly easy to have  ideas floating around in your head I feel like this happens to every creativetype person. The key is to PICK ONE! Seriously decide what your absolute best project is and get to work. Put the others out of the spotlight because if you jump between different projects constantly youll end up with a dozen skeletons and absolutely nothing to show for it.If you have an idea for a different project that could be integrated into your big work do it. Cannibalize the crap out of your skeletons. If its a good idea dont hesitate to put it in. The key is that you have something actually finished after your hard work. Dont save ideas for later projects remember your job right now is to put out exactly ONE thing and have it be the best it can be. Worry about the next project later.The other really big thing you can do is collaborate. Ive been really bad about this in the past part of why I joined Homeloaf but its been a fantastic kick in the ass when it has happened. You immediately have a specific project to work on and there are actual concrete motivators like deadlines and other peoples opinions. Speaking as a musician if you have  days to get the drums bassline and FX done youre going to get them done whereas I can spend a week tweaking every little thing otherwise. TLDR Pick ONE project dont be afraid to cannibalize ideas from other projects youve got floating around and collaborate.,homeloaf,ck0280q,2,t5_337e5
