2207046,0,t3_2kcc50,Well... Thats kinda hard. I really liked Margaret but I really do think CJ is a much better girl for Mordecai. Margaret was the dream girl that Mordecai always wanted but CJ is the girl he really wants. I really do like the character development Regular Show has had these past two seasons. Never would have thought a show I always watched because of its unique comedy would have that.,regularshow,clkdb5b,6,t5_2sfbv
2213823,0,t3_2kh1m1,Muscle Man has about a dozen episodes too many dedicated to him hes simply not an interesting enough character to really deserve the focus the show gives him.The show itself is kind of weird when it comes to girls. The only reappearing nonparent women are CJ Margaret and Eileen and Margaret was pretty much only used as the shows representation of the friend zone for most of her episodes.edit more evidence of this comes from some of the shows oneoff characters like in Cruisin and the New Years episode. Whenever someone not named Margaret Eileen or CJ shows interest in Mordecai and Rigby theyre trying to get back at their boyfriends or trying to win back boyfriends which isnt great writing or characterization.edit edit I forgot about Starla but shes not all that great either. Used as a punchline or as a grotesque way too often. The one time she wasnt going out with Muscle Man she took a liking to Mordecai but it was eventually only to get her back with Muscle Man,regularshow,cll8apa,46,t5_2sfbv
2302016,0,t1_clvfqqs,What bothered me was how nonchalant Mordecai seemed.

They joked about the situation and had their own reoccurring injokes.Regular Show could do that. But its more about taking bits and pieces from many different s and s movies then escalating them. The plots are never exactly like the movies because the focus is elsewhere.At its heart Regular Show is perfectly named.

Not sure whats up with that.,regularshow,d84v7pc,3,t5_2sfbv

10372354,0,t3_5ocf3m,I remember seeing the early promos of Regular Show. They didnt show much just the Rigby and Mordo synchronizing watches in from Skips. And the tag line Regular Show. Its anything but. And a scene of them driving the ride mower.I had no idea what to expect from this show. Unlike Adventure Time I didnt know about the original unaired pilot. Little did I know it would become one of my favorite shows.Whats even better is this is a show that could have really gone on forever hypothetically. Just the random crazy adventures of two park workers and friends as they discover the strange an unknown only for everything to go back to normal the next episode.There was no hidden background plot like Adventure Time. And yet the writers were able to craft such an amazing overarching story in the two final seasons its almost like a different show completely.The ending hits hard for me not just because its over. But because we may not have another animated show like for a long time. I hope JG Quintel and team have another project in the works so they can express their style and humor in the future. Regular Show is oddly such a unique show in how it presented itself.As Pops says Good show jolly good show.,regularshow,dcjrobc,12,t5_2sfbv

Physical copies are hardly as prevalent as they once were.And on top of that....The show was brought willingly to a conclusion by its creator it was not driven there by poor ratings.,regularshow,dct9pqf,2,t5_2sfbv
