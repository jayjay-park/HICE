9652244,0,t3_5d7cne,how well do your caps stay in the bearings? The D printed caps I have on my current one dont stay in very well anymore after about  weeks of carrying it. ,FidgetSpinners,da2u823,1,t5_3hd6q
9803954,0,t3_5eve7g,It sounds a little like theres dust in the bearings.Bearings come from the factory with grease in them.  Its a little sticky as lubricant goes but with time it loosens up.  It keeps the spinner smooth and silent.What you CAN do to make it spin faster is to put a little oil like a single drop in it.  This strips out the grease and frankly tends to make the bearing grind a little  as it sounds like yours is doing.  It does make it spin faster immediately though.Ive got an Etsy shop selling spinners myself  though not the one you bought from.  Personally I dont oil the bearings as they leave because as I say it doesnt do them much good in the long run especially an expensive ceramic bearing.Im a little confused since the bearing holding back is a sign of grease but grinding is a sign of oil.  That said a seven minute spin is unlikely to be because of the bearing.  Heavier metal or wood spinners hold momentum better than light plastic thats just physics but Ive never seen a plastic spinner move for anything more than a minute in real life.  Maybe Im just making crap A side note you mention that postage from the US is insane and you are correct.  You might have more success shipping to Europe from say the UK have you tried searching for UK fidget spinners?  This is blatant and shameless self promotion.  Plus our economys in the shitter so youd probably get a better exchange rate.,FidgetSpinners,daljr0u,1,t5_3hd6q

I think it may still have a touch of moisture in it so I think it will spin even longer after a bit. Ill be sure to use this technique in the future.

Wipe mineral oil on a flat surface such as a pane of glass on the table top.. Use same applicator pad to apply oil to the top surface of the button ridge and the outside edge.. Apply clear silicone caulking to the button inlay area corners toward center to avoid air bubbles.. Then press button against glass to squeeze out excess. Let it cure for a day..

11104645,0,t1_deqonoe,Hey DogsCatsAndHorses! Good to hear from you again!We have no plans to have two separate sizes at the moment  But its definitely something were going to consider after it goes live. I actually have pretty big hands as well Im  lbs and the final size fits very comfortably in my hands. So I dont think youd be okay with it. However feel free to grab one on Amazon and just try it out if it doesnt work out just send me a message at chasealphabotindustries.com and Ill waive the returnrestocking fee for you. I got you!The protruding triangles are actually stylized weights. Our earlier versions concentrated majority of the weight towards the ends away from center axis and did not have the triangles. While that design gave us a slightly longer spin time it caused a weird unexpected wobble whenever the spinner is turnedtwisted while in rotation  the triangle weights were added for weight distributionbalance purposes to eliminate the wobble.Regarding other colors... I shouldnt be telling you this haha but were actually planning on putting out a few batches of limited edition colored models after the first batch sells out dont worry we wont charge more than a few dollars extra for them. Were just trying to figure out how to reliably electroplate the colors onto the steel at the moment we dont want to using paint or a coating that will scratch off. Im not sure if rose gold crazy how popular this color is now would be an option but well make sure to send out a newsletter or post another update when that happens.Thanks again for all your feedback!!,FidgetSpinners,deqpa8x,2,t5_3hd6q

11307713,0,t3_61bnkz,If you want some interesting reading go do a search on the effect of counterfeiting in fashion. Basically in that industry it drives innovation. You could argue the same for a lot of different industries and I believe for this one as well. I am into quality mens clothing but Im also frugal. One interesting thing going on in the clothing industry right now is the resurgence of the cottage industry. A good example of this Wolf vs Goat. Its basically a oneman clothing manufacturer. He makes quality clothing with highend fabric and interesting details. The thing is what can you really make in market like this? Shirts and pants are basically the same between every manufacturer with maybe a few difference in details. An oxford cloth button down shirt is an oxford cloth button down shirt. So what WvG offers is high quality cloth like overdyed Italian oxford cloth with handlathed motherofpearl buttons. Maybe he tweaks the fit a bit to differentiate it from other brands or offers a higher quality manufacturing process. The point is theres an actual value being offered here for the premium price they charge even though its just a shirt like every other shirt out there. Like others have said pretending clones dont exist isnt an answer. We live in a free market. If a high quality spinner can show that what theyre offering is worth the premium theyre charging people will pay it. It also helps drive innovation. If people are copying you great that means youre the standard to beat. Find the next new thing that people will want to copy. Or offer something that people cant duplicate. ,FidgetSpinners,dfdpngo,3,t5_3hd6q

11441206,0,t1_dfstb6m,And i did not meanwant to type this much.  I just had a problem claiming to be the first when its been done and is out there for free due to great actions of someone.   I see it as a patent troll move to try to patent something you did not come up with but saw another project that was free most likely.    But that is up to patent office to decide.  I was even offering a suggestion as I thought it would have done much better if offered in a alloy metal for the price which could be done.  This kinda evolved when he also stated vastly wrong facts on printing quality and price.   I got a little triggered but at end of day this project will not get funded i dont think... so kinda moot point. But I am surprised by comments of him as I expected business level communication as he is trying  to promote a product.  I am going to leave it here and not post more as I feel it is not going to help be constructive.  My original post was meant as constructive with reference it was done and pointing to where it was with usb drives.  Bickering backforth will not help the product or worth my time.Again all is my opinion so take it for what its worth,FidgetSpinners,dfsum5x,2,t5_3hd6q

11736949,0,t3_67hgof,Congratulations! It is a very hefty and well designed spinner. It is currently one of my favorites! My hands do get tired after extended periods with it.,FidgetSpinners,dgqevld,6,t5_3hd6q
11738699,0,t1_dgqk8f3,Exactly.I want long spin times but I also want silence. I also want comfort in the hand. I also want to know if its smooth or not.Spin time is literally the last thing on my list.,FidgetSpinners,dgqm0vd,2,t5_3hd6q
11739973,0,t3_67if02,Its such a satisfying sound perhaps it feels quiet? Maybe peaceful is a better word. All I know is that I find the sound calming and I could see me mistakenly saying quiet.,FidgetSpinners,dgqr7xw,1,t5_3hd6q
11742827,0,t1_dgqr08u,Why does everyone complain about the corners so much? My SS Y doesnt hurt that much and a quick sanding with     grit sandpaper will sort the hot spots out.,FidgetSpinners,dgr2v6m,1,t5_3hd6q

11794851,0,t3_689ono,Fucking unscrew it.,FidgetSpinners,dgwzilk,1,t5_3hd6q
11799822,0,t3_68d625,At Air Traffic at the MOA I purchased this beauty my second spinner. It has a great weight balance its quiet and has about a  spin time. The fact that you can unscrew and remove the knobs and tighten them for a different feel sells it for me! The white bands glow in the dark and it overall has a very high quality feel and it has the vibe of some odd electric or magicians apparatus. The bearing caps are thick and good quality and are also wide which helps with tricks.  well spent imo!Edit I havent bought any other spinners besides this and a torqbar clone so my view of quality may be clouded but honestly I love this spinner,FidgetSpinners,dgxjtvs,5,t5_3hd6q
