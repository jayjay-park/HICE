229410,0,t1_cf4gg4d,Mule is usually used to describe a char that just holds potsitems not the one you use for playing this one is often called alt. Since you have  slots you dont need an alt but you may need mules to store things your vault cant hold.Potting since you already have a  char you can start maxing another one. Id suggest to choose a class that will be able to farm godlandsdungeons in case your Necro dies. Thats completely up to you you can even max a second Necro. Once you have two potted farmers you are quite safe and can try any other char or play one of those. If it dies not a big deal  you still have at least one left just be careful with him. This is the safe way but takes some before you can stop grinding and start having fun.gt Is my main strong enough to do OryxYes you dont even need to be maxed to do Oryx. Rushing castlewc is risky though.gt How about other hard dungeons like the ones the Lucky Djinn etc. spawns?Yes but better to start doing them once you have a backup.gt I have defense pots saved and its very tempting to get like a T robe or something with it but people seem to think trading def for equipment isnt worth it?Astralelder you mean this by t robe right? are like  def.

After reaching level  people collect and drink potions that permanently boost a characters stats until a stat cap is reached. This is called maxing. Youll see people refer to  stats maxed  stats maxed and so on. The wiki can also tell you more about that.Then theres a slew of dungeons which really shouldnt be attempted any anyone without a few maxed stats and not without at least a small group. These dungeons are not only difficult to come across and difficult to complete but they also sometimes drop untiered equipment  equipment that functions differently that the normal ones in some way and is usually on par with the very high tiers of normal equips.You can also get high tier normal equips from these bosses and dungeons.Seriously though check out the wiki.

487461,0,t3_1zp6vr,Theres really no point in arguing with you. There is no personal benefit to boosting others because that is not the point of it. Sure if you need help in a fight it can be used to give your allies an advantage to assist you in defeating the enemy. However youre already going to get SB and by self boosting you are only doing additional damage that will not contribute to the SB requirements of others in your team. In small groups duo etc. it wont make a difference because both of you should do enough to qualify for SB. In larger groups however that boost can be beneficial for the poor  in the back that is being outclassed by everyone else.  If all you care about is yourself and your loot by all means continue to be selfish but know that you will very likely continue to be treated negatively. However if youre interested in helping other players assisting them in also acquiring loot being nice and just not being a scumbag why not share your boost? Youre already getting SB in.  Going to edit this for priests and such. I guess the Youre already getting SB argument wont work for them but you could always just be a nice guy and actually want players to live. If youre playing as a priest you probably dont want loot. Most people played priest to save lives not to present false hopes and just heal themselves.  Honestly I do not understand your selfish behaviour in the slightest and nothing I say will change your mind. I am the type of player to boost and heal everyone share my drops and chat with others in need of assistance.

527626,0,t1_cfzuy6y,Im ok with a guild or group of friends rushing malphas and I agree that it makes sense then because everyone understands that thats what the plan is.In most of those clips though it looks like two things are happening.  The first is there arent any abyss demons on your tail which suggests you killed them off before rushing the boss.  The second is youre usually the first one in and youre getting most of the damage.It looks like when you cleared the demons the other people thought you were clearing but then you rushed in to steal the loot once it was a bit safer.  You get  in most of those clips and I bet everyone else got  in lots of those.So either youre making your guildies get  a lot or you have a LOT of leechers.  When Im not running abyss with friends I would say at least  of my runs are solo.  Basically if someone leeches you should tell them you would like to solo.  Thats it dont discuss it further with them.  Then when you get to the boss dont stop to kill the brutes and demons on your tail just go straight to the boss.  That will either kill most leechers or make them think again about leeching off of you.,RotMG,cg08xad,1,t5_2s505

If I recall correctly and I may not the option to disable the purchase of stacked potions was not initially implemented so you could inadvertently spend money you didnt want to spend when using your hotkeys for the potions.  This wasnt a bug but just a slimy business practice.  Are you saying that once they introduced the option to turn the purchase option off it would still purchase sometimes?Since I was an exclusive priest user at the time I rarely used stacked potions at all.  I lost exactly  gold through mphp potion purchases.  It would be nice to have it refunded but its worth nor Kabams time.

866806,0,t1_ch2svi0,Pots or stat potions are  different potions found in dungeons and the enemies from the maps center. They increase your characters stats by   for HPMP until that character dies. They are found in dark blue bags and are valuable enough to have the trade market for hightier items be centered around them for example a Potion of Defense can trade for a t Sword. They are also the only way to increase your DEF stat outside of equipping higher tier Armors and Rings which makes them especially useful for keeping a character alive.Tinctures are similar but temporary. Tinctures increase your characters stats by   for HPMP but only for  seconds.When you level a character to  your characters stats are randomly determined within a certain range. For example you gain  HP per level up. A bad roll is a roll where your stats usually HP MP and ATT are below the average amount at lv.Heres the general locations of different stat potions  Speed Godlands Snake Pit Haunted Cemetery Deadwater Docks event bosses  Attack Godlands Sprite World Abyss of Demons Manor of the Immortals Oryx Shatters Davy Jones Locker event bosses  Defense Godlands Sprite World Abyss of Demons Mad Lab Oryx Shatters event bosses  Dexterity Sprite World Deadwater Docks event bosses  Vitality Abyss of Demons Oryx Woodland Labyrinth Haunted Cemetery event bosses  Wisdom Undead Lair Mad Lab Haunted Cemetery Oryx Davy Jones Locker event bosses  Mana Ocean Trench Shatters Crawling Depths  Life Tomb of the Ancients Shatters,RotMG,ch2t78p,4,t5_2s505

929441,0,t1_ch9n2n2,Farm Godlands and Sprite Worlds on your Wizard for now and store up any pots and good equips you find.For Godlands stay at the edge of your range spellbomb when necessary and try to pay attention to patterns and learn how best to fight enemies. Each enemy has its own quirks which makes Godlands quite dangerous.Sprite Worlds are common relatively easy and fairly profitable giving you guaranteed DEX chance at DEF chance at ATT and chances at t Abilities or  different white bag UTs. The common Sprite Wands also give  FP for your UC pet to power up some more. Heres a tutorial on how to do Sprite Worlds safely if youve been having trouble Once you have  DEF pots you can trade up to them with spare pots you find max Priest or Necromancer and then farm some more to max its DEX and SPD. Use your newly healing class to farm  more DEF pots for Wizard. With your DEF maxed on your healing class you can begin experimenting with more dangerous content. However I wouldnt experiment too much until your Wizard is also maxed DEF you dont want to lose all your progress without a backup of some kind. The reason I recommend a healing class first is because its a large investment and you want to keep it safe while you learn how to do higherlevel content on a maxed character. After youve learned the content and move on to Wizard as your main class your healer still remains as an excellent backup class if anything bad should happen to the Wizard.,RotMG,ch9xk5k,3,t5_2s505

Nerfing and balancing pets should have happened a LONG TIME ago preferably before it hits production but at the very least within a couple months not after Kabam aggressively promotes the ambrosiararelegendary egg packs for hundreds of dollars.

But that is also a choice he made. You staying has no affect on it.Edit To clarify this is of course if that person has entered a dungeon first away from everyone and not just been the first to enter in a crowd.,RotMG,ci8x6kg,1,t5_2s505

1254846,0,t1_cias17l,gtThere wasnt enough people testing who cared and the environment that Wildshadow had for testing wasnt sufficient for testing certain things.Not true because you didnt even try to test with them. They held private openings for testers all the time. At the end people would hang out and discuss the content how it could be improved and what bugs they noticed. It was fun it was fast it was open to everyone.gtYes I play as a loner. Maybe the community should improve themselves to the point where I would want to play with them.I play the game in a way it was not meant to be played but is tolerated IM NOT THE PROBLEM YOU SHITLORDS AREgtKabam made the potions cost  fame at my suggestion because the alternative to testing highlevel content required that either a dev be on to individually give every potion to a tester this happened several times or that we create characters under Prod conditions which is not feasible for time. Remember the  damage bullets near the beginning of Crawling Depths testing? Think about every character lost to attacks like that and you see why time wasted for the devs and the players adds up.That was a good idea im not saying that im saying it wouldnt even be necessary if testing wasnt closed off.gtNew enemy tactics arent noticeable. New bullets that fire differently like curving or tracing takes a lot of server power and display as objects not projectiles. They are adding things to reduce the influence of pets. However it doesnt seem any more effective than adding longduration Sick and Quiet to bullets except that it doesnt disable healing abilities.Youre talking about surface tactics things that have been done hundreds of times before Im saying they need to think outside the box.gtListing one thing that was reported during open testing does not erase the flaws of open testing.I provided a rebuttal to your claim nothing more.

From what Ive heard there are cases where people that died due to glitches were able to get their character back by showing proof.Since you already contacted them not much to do but wait but I wouldnt get by hopes up if I were you.,RotMG,ckfxl62,3,t5_2s505

1916834,0,t1_ckk46yz,So youre basically saying Sorcerer is a Noob Tube?And yes Sorcerer is a fun class for me too i got it to k base in  days.Pffifels DPS calculator does in fact show DPS of the ability you can choose the level of the mp heal so you know exactly how much DPS the ability does on ONE target. So if you are fighting  enemies multiply the ability DPS by  and add it to your original DPS. With a level  mp heal like mine i get about  DPS with my Sorcerers abilty. Not to mention if your mp bar is full and your fighting a gwall you can slash out about k damage in several seconds with the ability. The only scenario IMO does sorcerer win is if you have a very high mp heal and youre god farming.If you compare a Sorcerer and a Wizard in a abyss of course Sorcerer wins. But then again a melee or rogue would do that dungeon much better than both of them. I can go on and on and say that any class is better than Sorcerer in at least  way which covers up every single scenario except of course gland farming with divine mp heal.,RotMG,ckk5yzr,2,t5_2s505

2053146,0,t1_cl0rdnh,gt LOD no loot chests. Fuck you dblading knights that dont do shit but camp until the chest appears. You know who you are. I think it just needs a little tweaking so theres no safe spots. Round the corners off so the distance from the center of the room is the same all around and let the dragons and their minions chase over longer distances.Maybe buff the minions a bit too so shitty melee players can help out more without having to take big risks. Leeching is boring at least when you cant safely tab out the main reason they do it is because theyre afraid to risk their character. Give em something less dangerous to do and theyll help out. For instance most people Ive seen leech at Black at least helped out with killing the minions at the beginning. They know it speeds up the fight so they wont have to wait as longgtRemove old tops from mad lab and cem.I think the drops are alright for the most part T weapons only drop from the hardest boss in Cem. They just need much lower rates for T weapons from Mad Lab and for Ts from both.

Ninja is a class that is pretty decent at everything but is just so average that if you have different classes for each scenario it is useless. The only way i would consider Ninja to be good if i had a doku and midnight star but i only have a doku so i guess its not good for me.

Of course if they went too far over the line they would piss off their customers but my point is that what is a banable offense is completely up to them which could be up to and including people following around friends using notifiers.  Kabam COULD do something about it but we all know they wont.If people even think that its a possibility that they could be substantially banned for it theyd think twice about using the notifier or following around their friend but IMO the whole problem right now is that the people using it dont think its a possibility  heck neither do the people not using it and resorting to community shaming alone will be pretty ineffective.

As mentioned by Makon and Purp they can be turned in to the tinker for your fourth tier quest which will give you tokens that can be used to basically gamble for various items in the alchemist.  Every Monday the alchemist leaves the nexus and will come on Tuesday or Wednesday with different items.  Once he leaves your tokens will be deleted so if you get one use it!

When the majority of people are leeching and not killing the gods it results in the train being inefficient because they are moving slowly and not necessarily following the persons killing the most gods resulting in less fame gain for everyone because the person killing the gods can end up on their own with the train randomly switching direction because of a horse or whatever else.,RotMG,cphsu91,2,t5_2s505

3485936,0,t3_306qqz,Killing gods isnt nearly the most efficient ways to get potions. Dungeons are a much viable source. Theres no point in getting potions if you cant stay alive.On a knight without a good pet or maxed def you cannot expect to tank much. I see you like to play knight because it can tank more  but it is still a weak tank compared to its full potential.To get better loot you must learn to stay alive. On ranged screen rotation and playing offcenter is a MUST to use the full range. On melees I guess its fine not to rotate but Id highly advise you to learn to rotate and offcenter those skills help you survive a ton.Make sure your nexus hotkey is easy to reach. If your hp is ever like  or lower just NEXUS. The key rule in realm is lifegtgtgtloot. Its not worth risking a character you spent hours on for a def pot or a life pot for that matter.Personally I like to max dex first as its easy to do sprites on knight shield and tank should do it. After that the next stat that many max is spd. Sometimes I find snake pits hard to come by and try to get my speed by realmeye. After speed and dex your knight will be alot more mobile its time to max def. Maxing def takes a while as knight takes  to max but after you have def youll be very strong. Find an abyss buddypally works great learn to abyss and slowly max def. Once you are  att will probably naturally get maxed as its only  or so to max. You should be around  now. Wis and vit just help make your knight even stronger and a maxed knights pretty darn solid.I wouldnt recommend you play knight just because it tanks better than other classes relying on this fact is a crutch that wont allow you to see other types of gameplay options like the powerful ranged classes and the other melees. ,RotMG,cppme6s,18,t5_2s505

3742265,0,t3_339rvy,The dungeons that should be easily doable are the Sprite World and the Snake Pit. Snake Pits will give you Spd pots and Sprite Worlds will give you Dex. Both are guaranteed drops. While they are easier to max first the optimal way is to max Def first. That takes longer but its more important since Def is what keeps you alive. If you go to a trading server or use realmeye you can usually buy a Def for  Spd or  Dex.Sprite Worlds are dropped from the little things around Sprite Gods. They seem difficult at first but they really just screw around with your movement and theyre not that hard to get used to. Youll want to watch out for the Native Sprite Gods which are the same as the ones in the godlands. The boss Limon isnt too tough. Attack him or back off during his running around phase then when he makes a box of bullets around him go inside to fire at him and move side to side to dodge his shots.The Snake Pit is dropped from most of the minor gods. Like the green thing that spawns dark elves the large steel construct that spawns undead dwarves and that other thing with the crown. Youll want to move through but be a bit careful because if youre not maxed then the minions damage can build up. The boss shouldnt be too hard as long as youre careful to dodge the stuff. Also theres a chance of treasure rooms which also drop Spd. So you may find it worth it to explore the whole thing.Bluenosers Guide is a great resource to learn from.,RotMG,cqiucoe,1,t5_2s505

Dont let these people get to you theyre stuck in a selfperpetuating circlejerk that involves calling Realm a terrible game. Yes Kabam is a company geared toward making money. Thats what companies do. Theyre the reason this game is still alive.                            To answer your question we dont know whats in store for the future however based off of information from corporate levels of Kabam it appears that Realm is part of a deal that will allow the game to stay alive longterm at the cost of not having frequent or any updates. ,RotMG,cqle8pm,6,t5_2s505

They are only unlocked after certain fusions and after the unlock must be levelled from .. Each unit of peed power you feed is less effective for nd and third ability. For example if you feed a fp item to your pet it only contributes about fp to nd ability and  fp to the third source This means you should place the most desirable ability in the first slot. ,RotMG,cr8ncb4,2,t5_2s505

5694723,0,t1_cx2z8o1,It may not have a significant effect but it does take a small load off of whatever system is being used to render graphics GPU or onboard. The reason is that windows aero that cool semitranslucent effect on the edges of windows is actually drawn on screen with usual alphablitting math.The Windows xp theme does raw surface copies I.E just cutandpaste the image onto the screen but has some overhead due to not being a perfect rectangle it has some rounded corners. The old Windows  theme as seen here enabled by turning off advanced rendering has none of these minor overheads and therefore can in theory render faster. Rendering faster means it hogs less graphics calculation leaving more available for the game.The thing is that these days unless you are running modern windows on a computer old enough to be designed for Windows XP or  it shouldnt make a large enough difference to be noticeable. The reason people believe this is because this is the most visible change that occurs when you set a windows machine to full efficiency mode disabling all extraneous graphics. When you combine this theme with not dragging windows using the outline instead not giving them shadows barely noticeable when they are there but very noticeable when they are gone! etc. there can be a real performance gain.,RotMG,cx2zhdi,5,t5_2s505

Rolls are completely random and when making a new character check at level  before drinking stat potions if its hpmp stats are subpar. If so you should kill him off and try again so that in the future you dont have to spend as many potions to fully max him. hp means you need to drink  extra life potion to max life hp means you need to drink  LESS life potion to max lifeI try to go for at least hpmp when Im rolling a character.Hope this helped,RotMG,czsk3wz,2,t5_2s505

6623585,0,t1_d04clqp,My first bit advice to you is try to start maxing out your pets ability a little more. Believe me a few levels gos a long way. Next up if you want to train yourself to rush abysses warrior wont be the safest choice. I would say use a paladin with CC or a paladin with veng and an exaltedparamount defense ring. With your ability you can instantly heal yourself for a certain amount of hp and heal yourself even more at  hp per second. As well as your a max HP buff you can tank so many nearly everything. In my opinion rushing abysses on a paladin  is easier than rushing abysses on an  warrior or an  knight.

AND create new and exciting Mystery Boxes and the Alchemist only to have them completely closed down!

8250238,1,t3_4sevms,A severe nerf to pets is necessary if you want to avoid driving away new players or encouraging new players to cheat.In the past when I was a noob to this game I was able to reach Oryx on characters that werent even level  and profit with just a PBag drop. This PBag would be useful to me because at the time some PBag drops were worth a speed potion at least.That was back then. Today try doing Oryx Castle on a plain level  unmaxed character. You cant. Everyone else will rush passed all the enemies without clearing while youre left alone to fight everything. The only solution is to get a pet that must have HP and MP healing since every other ability is useless in comparison.New players MUST fame farm BEFORE they try making a good character. They are encouraged to make characters with the intent of dying just so they can earn more fame to feed pets. Players are encouraged to grind the godlands and sprite worlds for weeksmonths and then decide whether or not they think this game is fun enough to spend money on a character slot to make things easier for themselves.If you want to both maximize stats on a character and gain fame for pets Id have to buy a character slot and designate one as a fame farming slot and one as a character to max. If I were a new player this would completely turn me away from the game because that is pay to play on a free to play game. Oh Im sorry its not technically pay to play because you are playing the game. But if you actually want to enjoy the game fully as it is meant to you must as I said earlier grind for weeksmonths before you can actually play.Yes Im calling character slots pay to win. Pets have removed the coop that was in the game in the past a time when people actually cleared dungeons as a group. Content that new players could experience when the game was harder before pets can no longer be experienced by these players because the game has become easier for players who have spent more time playing the game.Pets as a concept are fucked. Nothing should effect how easy a game is so severely. Im going to focus on some other things that I consider to be fucked about this game.The whole merchant system. Trade up merchants spend hours in the nexus waiting for wealthy players to come by and overpay for specific itemspotions. They repeat this process in order to gain better items. See People can enjoy the game however they please. But during that video the entire market was screwed by duping. So everything was incredibly cheap and easy to get.What am I getting at?So players with pets are the wealthy players. Players who can grind dungeons effortlessly and get the abundant but also desired pots mainly defense. Grind abysses grind sprite worlds etc. These players with pets then overpay in the nexus for items they dont want to wait to grind for WC tops life pots UTs back in the day. Let me put it this way they run through those dungeons wo clearing them only to kill the boss for loot maybe even grinding only for the bosses UT drop. Then they go to the market and overpay for the most expensive itemspotions just to increase their wealth. Meanwhile the players at the receiving end the ones who grind the market for long periods of time and then jump at the sign of one of these wealthy players overpaying for something  this is the fate of all new players for the majority of the earlygame of realm.Meanwhile players who have pets can play for the rest of their time in realm and never have to trade unless theyre overpaying for potsitems theyre too lazy to grind for. Items at that point are irrelevant and just an aesthetic.Ive been ignoring realmeye that is a massive timesaving resource. It acts like the grandexchange in runescape. That is the only saving grace for the current trading meta of this game. Also I mut mention how this was only incredibly worse back when items were super expensive and the game was harder.Trading cant possibly be fun if its the only thing you can do in this game as a new player. And people with NPEs you have all the knowledge about how the game works its not the same if you say you dont have difficulty maxing a character on a new account or new character slot without a pet.Thats about all I want to put in this actually.,RotMG,d58u3vu,-5,t5_2s505

8377111,0,t3_4uc5za,Ya I definitely think that some of the UTs should be buffed especially the ones that are so hard to get like the cutlass but it doesnt have to be the DPS maybe make it shoot faster or even armour pierce as it would make it more OP and make it unique which might make it more useable. Also with the leaf bow the way that it might be buffed could be that the fire rate might be buffed and it could also be armour piercing as the fact that it does less damage and doesnt shoot through monsters means its much less useable compared to the other bow. I feel that the ray katana could benefit for an increase in fire rate and something that might make it cool could be that it could be like the dblade in that it shoots two shots at an angle. With the LoD armours I think that the fire armour might be cool if it was mainly DPS armour in that it sacrifices even more defence but it could gain a dex boost which would make it a great armour. The leaf armour should definitely get a def buff as it is useless and a hp buff to make it more useful like if the stats were  def and  hp then it could be useful combined with a UB HP. With the water silk robe the def should be boosted and the speed boosted it might also be interesting for the robe to give more vit than the mad scientist as that would make it a good robe for rushing. The fire cracker katana would benefit with a damage boost so that it would be like the ep in that it would be good for chests. If there are any other UTs that you think need a buff feel free to reply to me and I will do a review of some other UTs,RotMG,d5oos6h,2,t5_2s505

New vault space is great even though Im far from the cap because of how handy the walkway down the middle is thanks for keeping in the secret Oryx statue by the way! and I look forward to more stable servers.Love what you did to multiboxers.  In my opinion youve made unnamed accounts exactly what they always should have been a trial version of the game for genuine new players.  New players dont need teleportation or soulbound loot to get the gist of the experience so youve effectively crippled unnamed multiboxers especially for RWT purposes.  Now just make sure you keep cracking down on bans to the named ones and multiboxing may meet its end very soon.  You ought to give yourself more credit this is fare more than a very small step as you put it.,RotMG,d6205jg,13,t5_2s505

It dropped from godlands which many new players would farm for pots. Back then it was common for somewhat newer players to farm godlands for hours to max out characters and they often had excess speed pots.. Defense didnt drop from abysses which is where  estimated of our defense pots come from.. There was a huge gap between the rich and the poor. In those days the top  owned  of the wealth in the game. It was hard to get up to the top and defense potions were necessary for that. Vitality was also a high priced potion due to its rarity and utility.. No functional pets. If you can get a  uncommon pet you dont need to worry about running snake pits for wealth anymore. You have so many other options to gain wealth such as Sprite worlds or even abysses.,RotMG,d6k7w11,3,t5_2s505

8673601,0,t1_d6phv28,I am capable of critically interpreting offensive statements  I dont get so offended as to could my judgement or let emotion precede reason. If I perceive someone as an idiot I make a conscious decision to disrespect said individuals ability and desire to hold an intellectual conversation. The main point of the words may not be inherently offensive but their delivery context and intent is. Of course offense is subjective and no one is obliged to take offense. There may be overzealous people who use triggered and the like too trivially but that demographics potential overreaction in no way discredits any offense I might take. Also I apologize for my earlier tldr. Its apparent that your view stems not from inability to understand context but is instead a differing opinion on the merit of offenseemotionsomething or other.gtTrying to correct their behavior is the wrong approachI am not aware of any correctional measures proposed by me or the comic. I agree with the comic in that when faced with something offensive with which one doesnt want to reason its best to disaccosiate oneself from them.So I kind of agree that arguments are not offensive. The only ones that I could see being offensive are just shitty quality things like terrible math or a monstrosity of an essay where one takes offense because of the pride they have in their craft or subject matter. That also is subject to context in that satire shitposts or other ironic contexts can make shitty shit nonoffensive.And...I forgot what else I was going to say.

If theres no power creep then that means things are stagnant and you as a player have nowhere to go. Thats not very fun so there always needs to be another challenge out there. The easiest way to provide another challenge is to add more power levels or whatever makes sense within a given game but that inevitably devalues the lower levels and all the power creeps upward.gt What impressed you the most about realm?Right off the bat the opening tutorial then the open grouping something Spry Fox added I think then the way people would open dungeons for others with keys theyd bought. All very cool. gt What did you like the least?The code was a serious mess especially on the client side.

What they apparently failed to notice is that it costed  gold. So I played it a few times got a shitton of tt weapons and one foul thanks Kabam.

8853394,0,t1_d7c1cbw,gt What about this one though? Relatively empty and clean.All items in the game are colorful so for me its easier to spot them on a simple background without any additional visual noise. I think that muledumps main feature is to allow players to tell quickly the location of each item and it wouldnt work for me with any background which has more than one color  it just looks messy for me. I also find it very hard to read text with colorful background  and I use muledump a lot to track fame bonuses on my chars. But hey thats just my opinion tastes differ  gt But awesome I shall have my array set to  which means  more char slots on the bottom by their self  new goal  more char slots xD jk im a broke dudeOr you can just make rowlength   your vault still should display correctly but there would be  char slots in one row. I like to use  in a row but my second row of chars is not filled I miss   two of them are empty and  I will probably buy someday. I also like to set it to  because I have exactly  mules for each type of potion so every next row of mules is filled with one type of potion except for the first one which has  for M and L. ,RotMG,d7c1wf5,1,t5_2s505

8985556,0,t3_53cdfo,The only buff that tiered bows need is to reduce the spread. Coverts DPS is on point with Coral and better than Dbow for enemies with less than  defense as seen hereThe issue lies within not being able to land all three shots. So a small reduction in spread is all the threeshot bows need so that it is more reliable to land all of their DPS. Ive played lots of archers using just Covert or Blood and its not hard to qualify for drops and if you max your attack and dexterity you do a pretty good amount of damage. Dbow and Cbow are higher because you are able to land all the shots you need so Covert just needs to be put more in line with that,RotMG,d7rxcab,2,t5_2s505

I have been playing Realm of the mad god since the begining of time i know how to do every dungeon inside out. I have played for years i literally have  hours logged into this game nothing says VIRGIN like this so why do we HAVE to have facebook to become a tester? I tried to make a facebook account but you need all this verification crap like ids or phone numbers i dont even got a phone because it broke and im ghetto and cant buy a new one so why should i have to go buy a new phone just so i can like some facebook thing and HAVE A CHANCE of becoming a tester... I find this is just a way for Deca to be noticed....Ya know I thought deca was really going somewhere they were actively doing small patches and realeasing new content like skins or new ut chests which was really cool because unlike kabam you dont got to literally pay for the skin you can run the dungeons if you find them but you can also pay for keys so deca that was a nice balanced profit for you guys. BUT WHAT THE HECK Facebook for tetser???? thats literally a steal for social status rep.... im not making this long  thread thingy because i dont want my friends to see my posts BUT BECAUSE I CANT GET FACEBOOK AND I DONT HAVE IT! I literally tried to make a facebook account JUST for this reason to become a tester... I signed up for some online texting app but facebook wont message me on there.....So im royally  out of luck for any chance of getting testing... There is one day to get it.... That is such bs. Well deca you were cool you were the wildshadow . but now... idk.... i think id rather kabam.... didnt they do open testing for the players on prod? that was neat.Why I deserve testingI went through all this trouble of trying to sign up to facebook for the sole purpose just to like some stupid post and comment why i deserve testing.... I made some online phone number thing to varify my fb account which didnt work i couldnt even sign up to it so there goes my chances i signed up to reddit and probably posted this in the wrong place just to b at you guys and your stupid move... I have logged so many hours of my life to this game i would play realmofthemadgod and eat dinner f sitting at the dinner table whats a family? I only know of a guild. So many dedicated hours of gameplay to this game and money spent. I have seen it all ammies Duping Multiboxing Fame exploiting but the worst thing i seen was kabam i thought they were terrible they probably sold the game so they could get money for hookers to go stand on the corners of streets and make money thats how greedy they are.

9112825,0,t3_553gkt,gtI thought if I made an account on a private server it would have the same items as my prod account.When I first started playing I thought my testing account would have the same items as my prod account. I wish that was true. I actually played a lot more on testing because of the free  gold that you gotI thought that there was some bug that gave people free maxed stats. Back when vitality buff happened heard some people talking about it I then proceeded to kill wizards and remake them but I never got the bug.I never knew the vault existed until my th or th day of playing because there was no vault tutorial back then. Then I thought it was a public access room so I kept going back inside trying to see if anyone else left anything.Also I thought that there was no way to dupe in the game and people claiming to dupe were just scammers. To be fair most of the so called dupers were scammers. However there was a way to dupe but the general population didnt know about it yet. ,RotMG,d877px8,1,t5_2s505

9132132,0,t3_55d8tz,Firstly welcome to the game! sorta. I would suggest you to start with wizard it is a very strong class that can help you get items and stuff for your other classes. After you get some decent stuff I should suggest you getting stuff for another class you think you like. If your wizard dies you can either create a new one or start a new class. I think the order of unlocking classes is very important and create characters by that instead of just unlocking everything at once. I would suggest you buying one character slot but that is your full opinion about wasting money on games. It makes a huge difference in gameplay but do as you wish.I would suggest you not to go to hard dungeons that are for more experienced players when you are just starting off. I have been playing this game for almost  years now and I keep going with my s to shatters or tombs and stuff and dont understand why I cant keep my characters alive P. Find friends and guild mates that can run with you dungeons. Do sprite worlds and snake pits to max dex and spd. After that find someone to run with you abysses. Again try not to get carried away with strong enemies! Once you have both spd and def maxed you can do some events while playing safely do Oryx manors and kill in godlands to max attack. You will get vitality while running those abyss of demons. If you have already a good pet remember to feed it high feed power items to level it up. The most preferred pet is heal and then magic heal as its abilities. For a beginner I would suggest you to stick with  classes Priest Wizard and Paladin. The priest will help you learn how to survive the wizard is for getting actual loot and items to make your characters stronger and the paladin because it is short ranged so it will help you learn the sword classes while it heals too! It is also good for running abysses so I would suggest you using a paladin for getting defense potions. You could also do some to get decent gear t abilities t weapons armors and good defhp rings. Hope this helped and good luck out there!,RotMG,d89kakf,1,t5_2s505

Why do we want a pinata to give def again?   I dont think any change needs to occur but if there was one you might as well remove vit from Malphas drop pool give him some high chance of dropping def like  and increase abyss troom chance while giving it vit.  Vit may be practically useless but people still max wisdom and mana on classes like warriors just to have that  or  stat even when their pets guarantee perma buff.  ,RotMG,d8vgkij,1,t5_2s505

9750671,0,t1_daelu58,gt For starters the game doesnt care who actually killed the enemy that dropped the portal as the portals are not soulbound or anything similar.Why would it matter? If a person is already around the portal and after restricting access still has the privilege to enter it it should allow their guildies to enter it too even if they were not around the portal. When you try to enter the portal it already knows who is allowed to enter and who cant do it means that every person around dying enemy receives a special marker or something like that which makes them able to share this marker with the guild members who teleport and try to enter the portal.

10406341,0,t3_5ox0wt,Will these Special Edition items be introduced at an increased drop rate?Also can you PLEASE make pet stones and character skins more accessible to the playerbase at large? Obviously you have to make a bottom line youre a company and I respect that. Thats why I pay for vaults and character slots instead of mules to support you for such a great game. But I digress just make SOME skins droppable like maybe a  ratio instead of the  or  that currently plagues the vanity items.Also the vanities that are available are generally dropped by OT and above and while not too hard they usually get steamrolled and laggy and all and some other dungeons are on the harder side for playing and accessibility. I guess all Im saying is maybe think of the little guys when releasing a few of the skins just obviously not all of them.

10469388,0,t3_5pvtmh,Now when started out my freind gave me the best advice ever feed your pet max it and it will max you. So that may not make sense but pets are a critical part of the game. They can have many abilities but you want a pet with heal then magic heal the third ability wont matter for a long time. The pet egg which will get you this quickest is humanoid they cost  def on realm eye generally. Watch a guide on this topic from youtube. But once you get a heal then magic heal pet you might want to buy items t weapons and t armours for  spd each then you can feed these to your pet. After that you just keep feeding your highest feep power items. I would feed most white bags UTs I get. The Forbidden Jungle Necro set is good for this as well as white bags form sprites like EPs and planes. If you want any in game help PM me through realmeye and I can load up a mule with some tt weapons and armours.Yours sincerely Zyrn,RotMG,dcut95d,1,t5_2s505

Its entirely possible And happens more often than youd think for the seeds of two or more players to match exactly when getting a drop resulting in getting the exact same loot despite how improbable it may seem. Current time is commonly used in random seeds so that helps explain how two different players can get the same exact drops at the same exact time.,RotMG,ddvspqa,2,t5_2s505

11004217,0,t3_5x4rnl,One of the creators of Realm made a platformer permadeath game where he fixed the problem of steamrolling bosses by giving them phases that needed both a damage requirement and a time requirement before they would transition into their next phase.This made it so small groups would easily pass the time requirement while they struggled to get damage in while large groups would always see bosses die in the same amount of time.  It also has the effect of preventing underequipped players from tagging along and getting easy loot because they would have to survive every phase.I personally think that is the best way to solve the problem and also I would love to see Oryx go through all of his dancing phases again.,RotMG,defaosj,9,t5_2s505

11022239,0,t1_degluvn,Ok enlighten me.Pretty much everyone needs character slots chests. If by not buying them you mean they would spend more...There is only so much time you can put in game. And if money they would spend on slotschests use to buy for example keys you can still play in  dungeon at a time. Cant do  at the same time. I dont see how that is longterm revenue when it is going to  be even easier for players to get more space so they dont have to spend money on slotschests. Sure it may be great news for those that already play but for the new ones they will think it is a standard feature not something implemented to make them spend more. After all more chestsslots means nothing if you dont have stable game. I didnt play because I expected deca to give me something something something but because I enjoyed it and this wouldnt entice me to stay if it wasnt for the game itself. I was going to buy more chests but I wasnt going to spend more on keys for example. And with this I will actually have more money left.How do you think this will bring them more money in the end? ,RotMG,dehc9t1,1,t5_2s505

11058885,0,t1_delh90x,Woodland Labyrinth is one of the dungeon with the worse risk vs. reward ratio of the game. Even though Leaf Bow got buffed and stacked shots semifixed the dungeon and boss itself stays dangerous and the reward mediocre. If you compare it to the other epic dungeons especially the one dropped the other Lucky God  the Crawling depths its very bad. Cdepths drops a mana potion and Doku No Ken which is still an amazing Katana. The dungeon and boss is predictable and easy to solo without much risk. Woodlab drops a vitality potion and Leaf Bow which is kind of cool but thats about it. The dungeon is really dangerous as you can get paralyzed and murdered by Mecha Squirrels really fast and the boss can confuse jump on you or melt you under heavy mini larvae fire talking from experience I died on a  Ninja instantly from a single larva burst they hurts on leather and robe classes.In conclusion Woodland Labyrinth is simply not worth doing because there is a much better dungeon out there the Crawling Depths which usually spawn at the same time so when people choose they go for the Lucky Djinn. Even then the dungeon stays incredibly dangerous for a mere vitality potion which you can get from an Abyss of Demons easily. The new buffed Leaf Bow is an incentive to do it but the risk vs. reward ratio of the dungeon is still unbalanced to this day.,RotMG,deli8wb,2,t5_2s505

It is definitely more healthy for the economy that sewers is the def drop the only thing i would be ok with is lowering abyss drop rate raising def drop rate to  remember its still  for troomsand then adding att to sewers at the same rate as the current att. that way sewers is definitely more rewarding while abysses are somewhat worth it  ,RotMG,deyrzy9,4,t5_2s505

Make a YT channel and upload your video or several videos to Youtube here Set its privacy to Unlisted  that means only people with direct link will be able to watch your report. Watch out if your video has any copyrighted music  better remove the whole audio track if you have any copyright issues. Video can be not edited at all but it should clearly show the cheats  no point to send if you started to record too late or if cheats are not clearly visible. . In description tell Deca what is going on and where to pay attention. Try to find realmeye profile and guild of the cheater which you are reporting add links in description too. Try to keep the video and description shorter if its too long then point out the specific time which shows their cheats most obviously. Use timestamp in format mmss and it will appear as hyperlink in YT video description. When sending a YT link you can also pick a specific timestamp and generate a link which will start video from the exact same moment  use this one in support ticket if cheats are not in the beginning of the video. . Send your evidence in a support ticket here  Subject Cheater name  report  Message YT video link  whole description just copy and paste it there. Double check the name of player which you are trying to report  some of them are not obvious if they are using I and l letters in their IGNs.

Something that would be so hard that you would pretty much require a train of people working together that would be very risky and slow to solo however it could drop higher tier items than godlands and have a higher chance to drop pots. It could have some very interesting structures within it as well which could be used as ways to get into new end game dungeons such as lost halls.By higher tier I mean common t weapons and t armor with a rare chance of t weapons and t armor and a VERY rare chance for t weapons or t armor.

11733754,0,t1_dgq1gwq,You are simply contradicting yourself. First you say that without the chest sentinel isnt a broken boss then you say that its only broken because it does have a chest. The chest was made as a placeholder until a better system was made the chest was never supposed to be permanent. If the chest was removed the sentinel would be broken because nothing would reward the dragger certainly not the other players.,RotMG,dgq1uby,1,t5_2s505
