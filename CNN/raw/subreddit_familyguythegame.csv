1820690,0,t3_2feeiq,Well that depends on your luck and how often you play.For Quagmire youre not going to be bound by time to get those but by the number of bombs that you have and how many Stewies per bomb you can average. The payout will suck but there should be enough time to cover that gap.For Stan Lee Id say its possible so long as you play a lot. When I was about that I was able to get him within  days or so of running those tasks. But really its all going to be up to the random number generator.In any case I wouldnt give up on either of them and would try to get as many of their tasks in as I could before calling it quits.

In a game like FG there will be things you cant do as a result. But there is still plenty to do. In a game like Candy Crush patience counts. Ill stay on a level for weeks if needed waiting for a luckier board and building skills. As long as its still fun why not?,familyguythegame,ct0qplx,3,t5_30pka
