535813,0,t3_2083d5,a k filter would help quite a bit.  You could also try the ND neutral density filter.  This helps bring down your highlights so you can get a nicer even contrast.Additionally as mentioned here before make sure you have a vector scope an oscilloscope and an actual chip chart not one you print off from a web page an honest to god real chip chart.  Something like this  Once you have this chart leave it in the middle of the field and zoom your cameras so that it is full frame in each.  If you dont have that much zoom physically move your cameras.  This chart needs to fill the frame of each camera.  Next Auto white and black balance each camera and save the settings as a scene or memory.  This will get all of your cameras pretty close to each other.Your studio friend should be able to help you be able to read the scopes and tell you what they mean.  Hope this helps.,VIDEOENGINEERING,cg16fy8,5,t5_2slmt

4317114,0,t3_3afidr,Woo hoo! I started a thing.I believe they picked a contractor to build the walls and such in our control room this week. Theyve got  days to get everything done or face penalties. It should be simple enough but I bet they manage to screw things up anyway. Its just a couple walls around our racks moving a door in the control room adding a couple walls and lowering the ceiling. Our biggest concern is dust. The racks are about  done and I dont need drywall in my servers.As for consoles who knows. We might just try to get the physical plant to build something as off the shelf consoles are probably going to be too expensive.On the technical side of things we were hoping that we would get a Carbonite and an Xpression but at this point it looks like it is just the Xpression. Carbonite might have to wait for next year. This means were going to be using the Tricaster for our productions which Im less than thrilled about.The video board show is going to be run on our Panasonic which got back from repairs. I was having trouble with it about  months ago and just shelved it because it wouldnt seem to turn on. I think it ended up being that the v rail died which explains all the weirdness.Were also going to get an ATEM to combine with Caspar as a master control switcher.Other than that Im not really sure whats going on. Were stuck trying to pull of a network level production on basically no budget. Were going to need a big infusion of cash pretty soon otherwise work is going to stop because we cant buy anything.,VIDEOENGINEERING,csc9lcj,4,t5_2slmt

4721726,0,t1_ctlkbte,Ive had experience with sending video via IP satellite link which you can use to pump UDP through as long as you use error correction. So if you can get MPEGTS stream out via UDP with either FEC requires bandwidth overhead or ARQ adds latency but more efficient you should be good. Youll need to shop around to find out how much the link will cost you  obviously the higher the bitrate you require the more expensive it will be. You must ask for guaranteed bandwidth though often IP link suppliers oversubscribe the bandwidth to reduce prices.The rest of the comments seem to refer to broadcast specific satellite uplink which is more reliable and much more expensive than a generalpurpose IP link. ,VIDEOENGINEERING,ctppoch,1,t5_2slmt
4874573,0,t3_3hncz9,Utah makes good stuff.  You need to look at Evertz as well.  I believe them to be considered .For a multivenue multicampus situation Id wonder if the carbonite router frame is really up to the task.Modern routers can mix signal formats and embeddeembed at need and the control systems are IPbased.  Additionally the evertz gear is all about realtime video over IP routing...  if youve got long intervenue runs its a big deal.   Combined with magnum incredible things can be done intelligent signal pathfinding.  The magnum SS control system is great.and yeah the carbonites kick the shit out of the atems in all respects except for price.If the router is just for signal routing it doesnt matter.  If youve got a bunch of glue gear and frames because you make all sorts of changes to the signals audio channels conversions as their routed around then consider a better router that can do that internally.   ,VIDEOENGINEERING,cu8z8a4,4,t5_2slmt
