4488,0,t1_ceexvep,Agreed on the moving up part but FYI  inactives are replaced during the season. Which is why we cant expand TOO much we still need a waitlist for midseason replacements.But also the more leagues the more work it is for us mods to keep up with inactives. Maybe we could be more lax about that in the potential th Tier since no one will keep their spots year to year anyway.ubarroomhero  this is starting to sound more and more like your Wild West tier idea haha,NarFFL,ceey5db,2,t5_2rtfj

1801003,0,t3_2f56bk,Just for some back story. I had a draft go late before this started and was on auto draft for the first two rounds. I did manage to get who I wanted in the first though. Lets hope Aaron Rodgers has a good year.,NarFFL,ck667ux,1,t5_2rtfj

2643656,0,t1_cn3nivu,To give others a better chance at advancing too. I applaud the fact that you advanced to Premier in  seasons but if you are confident in your abilities then it shouldnt matter that more owners are getting relegated every year. If you end up in th or th place do you really deserve not to be relegated with the th and th place teams? Ending up in the bottom  means you had a really bad year but those who finished in th or th still usually had pretty bad years too.,NarFFL,cn3npl6,1,t5_2rtfj
4684887,0,t1_ctl2lni,There are lots of different criteria that we use to make the decision on who to promote outside of the normal rules of promotionrelegation. The most assured way to not get a bonus promotion though is to ask about getting one.KiS KiS,NarFFL,ctl2q5l,3,t5_2rtfj

Hard to say if itll hold up but if you want to know what to compare it to you can always change the year to  on your scores page and scroll back to see what last years scores were.

5126510,0,t1_cv2g35q,I got screwed by the same play but in an even more painful way. I had Sam Bradford the guy I was playing had Ryan Mathews... who subsequently received the handoff and scored a TD. Lost by  with the second most points in the league against my best friend,NarFFL,cv3xqdg,1,t5_2rtfj

5265873,0,t3_3n2xjb,I hate people like this. He is obviously quitting because of his team a lot of injuries and not because of time constraints because when you look at the team from a predraft perspective it looks really fucking solid.,NarFFL,cvkrvg4,0,t5_2rtfj
7536729,0,t3_40cpfq,Down for whatever long time reddit user who never linked an email and lost my main account.  Only created a new one though for the NARFFL.  I think just because you dont talk or comment on other threads doesnt mean you wont be an active usermanager.  Someone with s of comment karma could bail on a league and be a bum manager just as easily as someone with  comment karma.Besides getting in to the league may make someone more active in the community.  My  cents and as I said Im down for whatever looking to make it to the NARFFL for the first time anyways.,NarFFL,d2yw11w,1,t5_2rtfj

8762584,0,t1_d70ynvk,I dont give a damn about preseasonal concensus rankings just use them as guideline for where is last position I can get a guy. Call me crazy but I drafted according to my rankings. Win or lose I will know it was because I went with my guts and not what concensus is.And who could I have gotten over McCoy? Noone who was above him in my rankings. I made some errors in the draft but they werent in early rounds.,NarFFL,d70zg18,5,t5_2rtfj

8897978,0,t1_d7he6hr,You also cant add and drop players within a day iirc so if you added him less than  hours ago hes locked til that  hrs is up. By that time itll be less than  hrs til game time so still locked. Not sure if thats how it works now but I know last year the hr add drop period was a thing. Not sure if the pre game rule was a thing last year tho. ,NarFFL,d7her6v,7,t5_2rtfj
