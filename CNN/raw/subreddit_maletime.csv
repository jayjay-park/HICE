5752138,0,t3_3svlqe,I have also found that besides being physically unable or barely able to cry crying makes me feel a hell of a lot worse than it used to. It used to feel like a release and a refreshment. Now it feels like I get punched in the face repeatedly my head swells up my sinuses throb my eyes feel miserable and squishy I generally feel like shit and it makes me angry.  lolIt is ABSOLUTELY the testosterone. I transitioned away from the US and there is no peer culture here telling me not to cry. I transitioned at  and am way over the boys dont cry garbage and Im an art major and bi. I have no emotional hangups about crying. I just cant any more. However I have found it easier to cry at happy things soldiers greeting their pets when they come home long lost family members reuniting etc. than sad things unless the sad thing is extremely serious like when I had to put down my pet when he was old and dying of liver failure. ,maletime,cxa3w55,2,t5_35j9x

And that has to be it. I  think being transgender is a product of some neurobiological forces that are out of anyones control. I dont know exactly what it is but I know its there. I think that well have the answer someday with research on the brain and transgender issues improving. Im fine with waiting although I like wondering about it.As for being crazy theres evidence to suggest that isnt the case and psychologists have come to the official conclusion that its not a mental disorder. Although it probably is hard to differentiate between crazy and normal brain variation because whats normal anyway when it comes to brains? The thing about mental illness though is that its abnormal in the sense that the person has developed it over time. They have a normal state and develop an abnormal state over time or through trauma. Whereas with us identifying as male is our normal state. Many of us have these feelings since childhood or puberty and have no trauma that could have caused it. So gender identity seems to be an unchangeable aspect of a person. There is no treatment to fix the brain so it identifies as the expected gender and many of us wouldnt want that treatment anyway. Although I would have been very tempted early on to take that hypothetical medication that would make me identify as female I much prefer to live my life as male because thats who I feel I am. At any rate its pretty clear that we arent Just crazy in the way that bigots would say.,maletime,d4v9466,1,t5_35j9x
8380395,0,t1_d5olge1,Heh i should probably preface that im thinking out loud on my water break here but a few thoughts come to mind. Humans seem happy to form identities around some pretty random stuff sports fans scifi fandom slight nuances in the interpretation of legal codes or religious ideology. Hell in some math departments faculty get really invested in applied versus pure math! Im still not sure i could even tell you the difference in a meaningful way. Just a wishywashy what the researcher themselves happened to envision the potential role their research had in society. Its not like the theorems themselves could only be used in one setting! But man it was definitely an identity for these folks! One with real world professional implications.. Identities seem to have a historical feedback loop. Ethnicities often have a flavor like this. The average joe likes to handwave ethnicities and say they represent a biologicalgeographical concept. But every ethnicity in practice manages to find its own unique way of defining themselves how random folks can join ifwhen to banish folks how they relate to diasporas... They usually turn out to be a pretty arbitrary mush of overlapping language laws religions family affiliations cultural traditions woven together by that particular ethnicitys history. Meanwhile new ethnicities seem to just glop together old ones get absorbed. Its all a lot more fluid than most people seem to give credit. I see genders having a similar historical quality.. Identities also seem to have a statistical quality. Like while theres often no one thing that ties everyone in an identity together there do often tend to be statistically significant trends within identities. And the recognition of statistically significant trends seem to play a role in creating identities. It makes sense humans would form an identity around biological sex. While sex could never tell you what a persons life will be there are life experiences that are much more frequently experienced by one sex versus another. And in any given culture it doesnt surprise me those notuniversalbutstillcommon shared experiences combined with a cultures economy history and traditions would give rise to genders  a kind of culturally specific abstraction of sex. Overall i guess im just trying to think about examples of how humans do abstractsymbolic pretty frequently including with how they structure their communities with these identity thingies.,maletime,d5p3jbz,1,t5_35j9x
