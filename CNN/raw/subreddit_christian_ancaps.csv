138736,0,t3_1sorgb,Personally I would see citizenship as arbitrary. If socialist panarchy tribe A wants X immigrants and capitatalist panarchy tribe wants Y that is how you would solve the issue. The issue with citizenship would be that assuming the country had no limits on what an immigrant could do would just being there make him a citizen? I like the idea of basing voting on land but I am not sure on citizenship.,christian_ancaps,ceu8cyx,1,t5_2y9io

I choose to believe in God so him being my lord is my choice. It is not forced upon me. Therefore it is compatible with the ancap view. ,christian_ancaps,crnnjfr,5,t5_2y9io

I personally that with terriostists flooding the world a strong immigration policy is whats needed. Anyway Hilliary is an evil lying leftist socialist.,christian_ancaps,d60g28i,3,t5_2y9io
10063463,0,t1_dbivmp5,gtcondemnation of theft and nonpayment of debtsOh of course I dont know how I didnt think of the idea of theft as a sin. That makes sense as a defense of at least personal property. Ive also given you scripture however that is against land ownership or what leftists call private property Leviticus . The old testament also outlaws charging interest and an interestless loan would be consistent with market socialism as far as I know. As far as nonpayment of debts I think the parable of two debtors is relevant. In this parable the saved person is compared to someone who has had an unthinkably enormous debt forgiven. So its silly and even punishable by torture in the parable for the forgiven man to insist on collecting a comparably trivial debt.gtthe early church was voluntary. Nobody was being forced to be a part of the society.What does socialism have to do with forcing anyone to do anything? Heres the definition from wikipedia just to be clear what were talking aboutgtSocialism is a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production as well as the political ideologies theories and movements that aim at their establishment.Or more simply when the workers own and control the means of production. Which for the second time in this thread can be done by a variety of strategies including cooperatives and trade unions. Youre talking to a pacifist libertarian socialist here I deal with low effort statesocialist strawmen in almost every political conversation I have And I would love to see a source on the literacy rates dropping since public education began if you have one.,christian_ancaps,dbjakcc,1,t5_2y9io
11671923,0,t3_63t8wz,I think maybe we have to consider that Paul was simply wrong. Its not like apostles were never wrong before so why should romans  be the right approach that Jesus would agree with?This seems to be the elephant in the room. For that matter maybe Rothbard is wrong on occasion as well.,christian_ancaps,dgj11hp,1,t5_2y9io
