3272843,0,t3_2x2xmd,Great picture and link! Ive been a member of several Buddhist traditions and none have been more active engaged and emotionally invested in their communities as the SGI. Even though I have practiced with other Sanghas I still always felt that I was practicing alone. SGI feels like a family. I love seeing SGI active and helping communities and not just sitting on a cushion  times a week in a building.,SGIUSA,cp1bxh4,3,t5_2shjz
