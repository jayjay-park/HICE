1851062,0,t1_ckbz5zf,Jon was fantastic. Everything he said and the way he said it made me laugh. I miss him seriously.Its pretty sad that rewatches of Jon episodes are usually much better than the current era. Things were so much better. Barry was behind the scenes and completely silent there was no Suzy no useless tiein shows table flip etc.. Everything was just so much more organic. Now it feels like a brainless product like Markiplier or that idiot pewdiepie.,classicgrumps,ckc8yda,17,t5_332v0
1987667,0,t3_2hdqzt,I made this comment on the video a while ago and I thought Id repost it here because it is relevant to us now more than everYou know there is a dormant sleeping chunk of the Game Grumps fan base Us. The fans of the original Game Grumps who after Jon left watched as they went their separate ways always hoping that the two would come back together if not for just a single moment. Since both Jon and Arin never talk about their time spent with each other as if it never happened we have been left with nothing to go off of... nothing except ourselves. It is us who keep making content to keep the involvement of this idle leftbehind fraction of the fan base alive. Thank you for helping us retain the interest of the original Game Grumps.,classicgrumps,ckspqh5,11,t5_332v0
