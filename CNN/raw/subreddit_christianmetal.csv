2598133,0,t1_cmxa4wh,So based off what you have given me My favorite of these is Ethirion it was in fact my example so its got to be my favorite. Its actually exactly what Im looking for but they are the only ones I can find like that. I love the music of the first four. Its exactly what I want but I want the death metal screamingscreeching in there as well. I also like vaakevandring but in the other I would have liked more of the violin type stuff like what was present in the first  nonetreme. Another example of a band I like is Betraying the Martyrs breathing in life. If you could help me find stuff close to them and Ecthirion I would love you.Man Made Disaster,christianmetal,cmxpohc,3,t5_2ru48

3998997,0,t3_369kih,Oooooh. Thanks guys. I was wondering why there was so little core in here.... Was sent over here from rshreddit. Should read the rules more often,christianmetal,crc48ou,3,t5_2ru48

5848382,0,t3_3vc9gc,Here are some Leviticus  Psalm XXIII Place of Skulls  Psalms Plon  Psalm CXXXIXAnd of course dont forget this classic Trouble  Psalm IX,christianmetal,cxm9230,4,t5_2ru48
5876300,0,t3_3vq32u,Honestly I find that this kind of thing can cheapen a lot of great bands. A listing of Christian bands associated with certain canonical styles might be more appropriate. This might look something like|Raw Black Metal| list of canonical bands| selection of associated Christian acts|Admittedly there are a vast number of bands Christian or not that are derivative of more mainstream bands but the best bands and those that people who come here should care about really are not. Expecting band X to be just like band Y produces a lot of misconceptions and keep someone from fully appreciating the talent of either band.,christianmetal,cxpwxtr,3,t5_2ru48
6090014,0,t3_3yyvl1,gt What would A Christian Metal Family Tree Look Like?Hopefully a lot better than that piece of garbage.The problem with making a Christian metal family tree though is that Christian artists were influenced by secular artists first and foremost and not so much by each other and this is a good thing.,christianmetal,cyhvdb5,3,t5_2ru48

7024275,0,t1_d1cjoiz,I guess I can tolerate Horde  Antestor and Crimson MoonlightAre their UnBlack Metal vocalists like this guy you can try to find?Im not all big on vocals like thisI guess something about how the vocalist is doing his delivery of what hes saying reminds me of Ryan from Demon Hunter even though Demon Hunter doesnt fit the definition of a Christian Metal band.

8727314,0,t3_4zjlzj,Honestly nobody sounds like Joakim Christian or not. Your best bet is probably Herbie Laghans of Sinbreed. He does the low vocals on Avantasias song Draconian Love and thats really the only use of low octave vocals Ive heard besides Sabaton.,christianmetal,d6wk2ek,2,t5_2ru48
