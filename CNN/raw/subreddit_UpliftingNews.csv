1450325,0,t1_ciy2cmu,Hmm I have to say I see merit in having kids try to figure out how to solve a problem on their own.  I do a little amateur programming and reinventing the wheel can help you really fully grok how something works instead of just blindly following a formula.  This depends a lot on what the problem is.  A lot of problems are far too complex for students to figure out on their own and Im not sure if this should be the standard way of teaching math.  Maybe on a few select problems this approach could be beneficial.gtNot to mention if your kid isnt keen on drawing gluing making collages and building things out of toothpicks theyre likely going to find math class very frustrating.

1508935,0,t3_2bay2o,Fair disclaimer I am somewhat active on rbarefoot. I appreciate the guys charitable feelings but I disagree with all these shoe charities we have going around. Just Google and youll find several people doing what this kid did and companies like Toms donating a pair of shoes for every pair someone buys really theyre overpriced and cheaply made youre just buying both pairs and only getting one. Barefoot is natural and healthy in almost any conditions. Our bodies are able to adapt very quickly to our surroundings. Its hard for us in America to walk on rocks because most of us wear shoes everywhere except our squishycarpeted homes.  Those foot problems that can be solved with shoes can believe it or not be solved permanently and less expensively by donating to organizations that bring clean water and proper sanitation to villages. Instead of  people needing to come up with  a year for fresh shoes to walk through sewage a similar amount could be used to dig a new well and develop a waste management program. This not only solves the problem within a few years but creates work opportunities. If kids cant go to school barefoot it is clearly a social problem more than an economic problem. Schools ought to adapt their dress code to a realistic standard. Its one thing to require shoes in the US I disagree that they should but its more reasonable where flip flops can be had for  but to require them where people cant even get cheap flip flops is a problem with the institution.Google The Problem With Toms and youll get several good articles about how this company and people like the kid in the video do less good than harm.,UpliftingNews,cj5f54k,0,t5_2u3ta

1795937,0,t1_ck5ap6t,Dont know if it helps but I taught at a couple of schools that hugely downplay testing and grades for a while. Ive also taught in schools where grades mean everything. I prefer the former.For us it was hugely about knowing our students. Taking time in class to talk with them especially when doing things like discussing literature. Taking home their workbooks both in class and homework and looking at what they were misunderstanding and what they were demonstrating. I used rubrics and tracked all of this in my own grade book and would give students feedback on their next steps rather than assigning a letter. I would have other assessments from time to time such as papers or the occasional test that I would use along with my professional judgment and what I had observed in class and in their work to determine a grade which tended to be more along the lines of not yet proficient proficient advanced rather than a letter grade. On top of that I would give a lot of induvidualised assessments if I needed to gather more information about a certain student.Through doing this when standardised tests did come around I could determine with a high degree of accuracy where I expected a child to test. On top of that it meant that if a child tested in a way that was unexpected in either direction I was able to pick up on it and look at reasons why. This was helpful in things like petitioning for special needs services as well as sitting down with some children looking at the test and discussing with them what we needed to work on to bring them up. Heck for one student it was simply teaching her test taking skills  she jumped over  percentiles in a few months not because she had become that much more capable but had learned how to work this type of assessment.I should mention though that in these schools there was a much higher focus on skills and competencies rather than absorption of information. It was far more important to us for example to see a child have a question and know how to find credible sources evaluate those soures and find an answer as opposed to being able to recite the answer itself off the top of their heads. ,UpliftingNews,ck5iyzw,3,t5_2u3ta

Its common practice for a physican to transfer hisher patients to another practice if they cant handle them anymore for whatever reason. Its just considered general medical ethics. It isnt hard for a family doctor to find work these days theres a severe shortage so nobody needs to buy patients. Most PCPs have a waiting list as it is.The only doctors who are selling their practices to hospitals are the ones still alive. They still remain the doctor to their patients they just pay a fee for the hospital to rent them space and handle the business side of the practice.

1880572,0,t1_ckfr76n,Ebola is in the news because there has never been such a large outbreak and its a rather scary disease due to the high mortality rate. But the high mortality rate also means that the spreading of the virus is somewhat slowed down. Every virus needs a living host to reproduce and spread. As soon as the host is dead and buried the virus particles inside this host are lost and cant help to spread the virus. Its in the interest of a virus to keep the host alive for as long as possible so many other hosts can be infected. Ebola just hasnt learned how to deal with humans yet and ends up killing them before it can spread very far. Thats why the overall concern about Ebola is still moderate. Its unlikely that Ebola will spread over the whole continent or even beyond that.Also About  people have died in this recent Ebola outbreak. In the same timespan about half a million people have died from malaria around a million from tuberculosis and roughly . million people from AIDS.

Why not call that optical transmission? Sure that will cause people who understand what optical means to believe that you can catch Ebola simply by looking at an infected person but that will just cause them to be more cautious so thats a good thing correct? Why do you need a special term for how is transmitted? Is transmitted through bodily fluids. Thats pretty damn easy to understand. It doesnt matter how you come in contact with those bodily fluids. Whether you are sneezed on by an infected person whether you share a glass with an infected person or whether you pay an infected person to piss on you during sex youre at risk of contracting the disease. If the virus were airborne you wouldnt have to be anywhere near an infected person to catch the disease. If the virus are airborne there would be a hell of a lot more people in quarantine right now.

Can you imagine how the stats from Egypt Afghanistan Iraq Iran Indonesia Morocco Pakistan Syria Saudi Arabia and Turkey would look like?No I reject your claim because the majority of Muslims in even the most educated and civilized countries seem to want to replace civilized secular humanitarianism and the freedom we enjoy with Islamic oppression and the human rights violations that it yields.Your mealy mouthed platitudes aside it is clear the future will see escalating conflict between the civilized world and Islam because the two ideologies are incompatible.

2601127,0,t3_2pkf7c,Similar concept to FoodCycle a UK organisation that takes waste food and cooks a three course meal for the community every week. There are hubs all throughout the country I volunteer at the Sheffield hub and I cant stress enough what an amazing project it is. Today I helped cook and serve a special Christmas meal for about  people. Our hub leader made a speech part way through the meal which prompted one of the regular guests to say a few words. She said something along the lines of I want to thank all the volunteers not only for feeding us but for being our friends and it really touched me If youre UK based and have a bit of spare time please look up your local hub and consider helping out. Its a wonderful feeling to work in a team to get a meal out and then sit and eat with people and see how much they appreciate it. Edited to add a link ,UpliftingNews,cmy3sh5,3,t5_2u3ta

2707918,0,t1_cnbr1oc,I would say the notoriously hard to handle dogs should have as good a life as they can get and then be put down peacefully as yours had if no one is able to give them a forever home. The resources time and effort that could go to dogs with less problems is the focus. For the dog I doubt he or she understands a good life of  years or a good life of  years. As long as it is a good life they wouldnt mind its length. Especially considering where the dog might end up or if you do not have the best containment and control for such a dog the dog could suffer horribly or cause serious damage to someone else. Its a tough call to make. In an ideal world all the dogs would have their match and die quietly in their sleep one day after long cheerful lives. In reality we are a force of nature for them we intervene to prolong their lives. It is our decision when to end their lives. Unfortunately they rarely pass as elderly graymuzzled dogs in their sleep. More often than not we choose when to euthanize a dog when it experiences too much pain in their aging bodies or from a congenital defect. Better a happy loved dog rests in peace than an upset passedaround dog that knew more downs than ups in its lifetime.You did the right thing you nursed the dog to health and showed him the most love and care a dog could ever receive and made sure no more harm came to him.,UpliftingNews,cnbvor4,5,t5_2u3ta

I visited several doctors and specialists at various wellknown hospitals and one of these idiots told me her great hypothesis. She said within just  minutes of meeting me and hearing what I had to say no tests absolutely nothing that I probably just rub the area and that is it. I just stared at her for a bit in disbelief realizing that my hope of figuring this out and all the time spent in getting an appointment amounted to this stupid doctor being absolutely clueless and not caring. I have pretty much given up hope on the medical field workers. Some are good and talented MANY are not. This story highlights this truth You are your own best doctor.

2970101,0,t1_co5nqou,Besides the lack of viable donor organs the main issue with lung transplants today is chronic rejection. If you receive a lung transplant youre put on immunosuppressants to stop your immune system from attacking those donor lungs yet in the long run it usually does just that anyhow. The immune system begins to attack the donor lungs and eventually theyre so damaged that most lung transplant patients end up needing another transplant after a few years.With the technique described in this article rejection itself and in turn the need for immunosuppression and all associated negative consequences of being immunocompromised might be avoided alltogether. Doctors could one day take the lung of a deceased donor reduce it until only the scaffolding is left then rebuild the lung itself using material from the prospective recipient. They would end up with lungs that are as good as new but genetically identical to the recipients own lungs thus invisible to hisher immune system. A big thing considering that lung transplant patients can expect to survive  years on average before dying either from chronic rejection or one of the side effects of immunosuppression cancer opportunistic infections kidneyliver failure.But what is even more important This research is another step towards growing solid organs from scratch. Right now they need to strip a real lung but one day it might be possible to dprint such a structure without reqiuring a donor organ. This would solve the organ shortage eliminate the need for waiting lists and revolutionize transplant medicine.,UpliftingNews,co5prca,4,t5_2u3ta

By subsidizingpurchasing something that is renewable not scarce or dependent on precious resources  you are subsidizing the creation of more of it.This is super basic shit.

3292903,0,t1_cp3lu9j,I agree but I think youve placed too much burden on the system. We already have programs where all inmates who will be eventually released or paroled can gain apprenticeship in a skill or in technical education. Those programs are a dime a dozen and they work fairly effectively for inmates who actually use the resources available to them.These programs are utilized by some prisoners but not all and thats not the systems fault thats the fault of the prisoners themselves. If Im sitting behind bars at Rikers right now and I see they have programs for learning how to knit community service and child care I could absolutely go that route. But I also know plenty of gang members and they might be able to help me get back on my feet when I get out from behind bars and give me a place to live and something to do. Plus they make the prison experience a little better with cigarettes booze poker and a general feeling of acceptance and family. Im not getting out of prison for another . years at minimum anyway so why should I bother doing all this work right now?The other side of the coin is that businesses generally dont want to hire prisoners and they cant be blamed for that. If Im running an Arbys and I get an application from a guy who was arrested for the possession of cocaine with intent to distribute just considering his application is a liability. What incentive do I have to pick him up? I already know he has made poor decisions in the past. I certainly never made a decision like that.

Anyways that breed is already rare enough in the US but that side of my family grew up in a small poor town in Louisiana so make that hella rare. One day the dog goes missing shortly after this gypsy family had moved in down the street. My aunt goes door to door one day to ask the neighbors if theyd seem the dog since shes pretty hard to miss. Finally she gets to the gypsy house and they come to the door and she asks if theyve seen her dog. They said no but se didnt trust it so she starts calling the dogs name and sure enough the dog comes running to the front door. She said they just stood their dumbfounded that they had been caught.

My dad thought the surgeon looked familiar and his name sounded familiar.  My dad asked him if he had worked at such and such hospital years earlier.

Could have happened to anybody and I was too naive to understand what was happening until it was too late. Nevertheless the Boy Scouts is primarily a religious organization and since virtually every single gay man Ive ever met is an athiest I can only conclude that the gay men who seek to be involved in the Boy Scouts are only there for one reasonTo rape kids.Its a target rich environment for grooming.I hope the Boy Scouts remove this obvious pedophile and strip this rogue group of their charter. There are many places for gay people to meet people who will allow them to suck their dicks and to give back to their community.

3747303,0,t1_cqjb9k0,Yes you are right  what is done is done and the prequels serve as a brilliant example of how not to expand an otherwise celebrated franchise. Official canonretcon or not Episode VII is a more direct sequel to the original trilogy than the prequels. Considering its place in time it does not need to and probably will not touch on the details of those films like celibacy fallacious politics MIDICHLORIANS etc. To defend and promote such continuity errors would be absurd. Even Star Warss PR department sent this child a message disowning a rite of the prequelJedi way. Not everything in everything is perfect.I grew up with the prequels and the slick streamlined visual elements of those films are sights to be seen  though the supposed evolution of technology from the sleek Naboo N to rustic XWings and Ties is jarring. But with intellectual maturity and the like the logic does not stand even the writing in the Clone Wars animated series is vastly superior to the prequels and it is officially marketed towards children.,UpliftingNews,cqjf1y9,1,t5_2u3ta

The word derives from the Greek  hemikrania pain on one side of the head  from  hemi half and  kranion skull. gtTypically the headache affects one half of the head is pulsating in nature and lasts from  to  hours. Associated symptoms may include nausea vomiting and sensitivity to light sound or smell The pain is generally made worse by physical activity.  Up to onethird of people with migraine headaches perceive an aura a transient visual sensory language or motor disturbance which signals that the headache will soon occur.  Occasionally an aura can occur with little or no headache following it.gtMigraines are believed to be due to a mixture of environmental and genetic factors.  About twothirds of cases run in families.  Changing hormone levels may also play a role as migraines affect slightly more boys than girls before puberty but about two to three times more women than men.   The risk of migraines usually decreases during pregnancy.  The exact mechanisms of migraine are not known. It is however believed to be a neurovascular disorder.  The primary theory is related to increased excitability of the cerebral cortex and abnormal control of pain neurons in the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem gtgtImage iInteresting Retinal migraine | Aura symptom | Acephalgic migraine | Abdominal migraine Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqodot oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqodot.

Evil implies some type of supernatural element and those feelings are used against us to fightfear things we can not change or affect. It also implies that someone should walk around judging good and evil. We can never defeat evil but we can change how corporations work and force them to make better decisions ones that we agree are socially acceptable The point of this subreddit is to find uplifting news. The man wronged in this article did not blame the people he knew to be constrained by their circumstances He was compelled to do the right thing even when others were being compelled to make an evil decision.

4317401,0,t1_csc7pkz,A few points.First a lot of women dont use it properly either so it wouldnt be surprising if men fucked up as well especially at first.Second I think that the incentive to not get women pregnant is bigger than you think.  I mean at least in my state if a women gets pregnant she has tons of options available to her to terminate the pregnancy if she wants.As a man I certainly dont have those options available to me.  Once she is pregnant she holds pretty much all the cards on the choice to have the baby.  Additionally it is pretty clear that the court system historically favors the women in things like custody battles.  While the physical burden of a pregnancy is obviously more heavily borne by the female the legal disadvantages faced by males seem to be a pretty big disincentive to not taking the pill regularly.Additionally I dont think your deodorant analogy is very good.  I mean if not putting your deodorant on could result in a emotional and financial liability lasting decades I dont think youd forget it that much.  If you do then I dont think it is fair to consider you a good representative of the male population as a whole.,UpliftingNews,cscarjx,23,t5_2u3ta

4320604,1,t1_cscnqo6,The other half is she doesnt want it and I do. The legislation that could fix it is scientific funding for artificial wombs. If she doesnt want it no big deal. The fetus is transferred to an artificial womb grown and  months later I get a kid without her in the picture. That same legislation says if She knew up front I didnt want kids we accidentally got pregnant and she wants to keep it its on her to handle rearing and paying for the child without my support or involvement. Thats called choice parity. And while you might be screaming in your head that its unfair those are the same options that a woman has right now on her end. She can terminate her financial obligation regardless of the mans desires or she can keep the baby regardless of the mans desires. It seems reasonable to present the same choices to the other party.edit P.S. your argument about no one being able to take away another persons rights. What about my right not to have a kid? Women have the ability to take away that right and its backed by law and the courts. What about my right not to have my baby killed? Women have the ability to take away that right and its backed by law and the courts Roe v Wade. Sorry man your argument is on its face inaccurate as you are only examining the problem from either the rights of the mother or the rights of the kid but not the rights of the father. Ignoring the rights of the father is bad enough but when you look at the rights of the kid you ignore the factual reality of the laws backing of the mother against the kid right now and vice versa  ,UpliftingNews,cscntc8,0,t5_2u3ta

Can the flipside also be true? The fancy organic kaleinfused acai berry juice is typically purchased by a certain demographic one that may be attracted to the fact that the company is donating to the homeless that they are supporting a company that cares about the less fortunate. That may be a marketing ploy in itself.The borderline poor have to deal with one thing the completely poor do not popular perception. They may be willing to spend that last dollar in order to sadly avoid the stigma of a food bank. A person that is completely poor doesnt have the luxury of that option. I say this from personal experience because I have been down to my last dollar with pay day far in the future but I would gladly spend that dollar as opposed to hitting the bread line.

If people in incestuous relationships want to take that consequence in stride its their business and doesnt affect me at all.

Yea my parents were not too happy when I told them I wanted to marry a non Muslim but its not like they killed me or disowned me. I was born if France and over there most Muslims are from north Africa. I have many friends from north Africa some wear the hidjab some wear that long black dress some married French dudes some dont really practice our religion. If some girls are force to dress a certain way it is a cultural thing. In the early s women who wear swimsuit that were to short would get a fine. All this to say that in this thread I saw a lot of people criticizing this girl in particular assuming that she was forced. My point was we are not all forced. Yea some girls are forced but not all.

Any abused dog especially one trained to dog fight is likely to bite someone at some point. Ive never met a pit bull with a caring owner that was at all aggressive. I know thats anecdotal but I just dont believe it. Sadly many people who would be willing to adopt a pit bull cant because of a ban on the breed by either a landlord or insurance company or both.

Their teeth are adapted to their diet so presumably its been this way for a very long time.Within those groups there are some groups that eat great white sharks for example and all members of that group are capable of hunting them as they learn by watching their mothers and grandmothers. Even if a whale leave this group they retain that knowledge. A member of another group will also encounter the same prey but wont know what to do with it and will not attack it.Equally different groups speak different languages as in they have different sounds to signify the same thing it has been recorded that some orca are bilingual and some can even communicate with dolphins.,UpliftingNews,ctflpl3,3,t5_2u3ta

And these increase the actual incidents of hate.Could anyone with a straight face tell you that there arent solid factions of both Israel and PalestineWider arabs that want publicly or secretly to decimate the other? I invite you to look at the charters of both sides plus the bits they erased. Yeah they want to kill each other. There is enough hate to keep this conflict bubbling endlessly and pointlessly... and not enough power on one side or stomach for ultimate brutality on the other to finish it. So it festers.And in the middle are all the people who just want to live their lives.So when you start with the dont trust the arabs line I felt like you were kinda buying into the bullshit. The hate is the tool. It is like the word terrorism. Terrorism isnt about terror. It is about hate and it is often about making your opponent escalate conflict when your people wont do it. The people on both sides who are vested in increasing the conflict and hatred need other people to hate like they do. Thats why they do things like cut peoples heads off and fly planes into buildings.Pick a side in this one and you are a moron.

Time can be kind.If you classify them as human words then I utterly accept your thesis and I am rightly said to be anthropomophising when using these words.I think they are applied more generally kindness especially.Bravery I am much less sure of I think you are right I cannot think of a thing being brave so for that misuse and anthropocentric falsity I apologise and retract any and all claims made to the contrary.Kindness though a lotion can be kind to the skin  doesnt have to be human or indeed alive to possess the quality of kindness.In this context on reflection you are  probably onto something and I apologise didnt intend to get it wrong many many thanks for helping me get a more rounded nuanced view.,UpliftingNews,cuejmf0,0,t5_2u3ta

4979326,0,t1_cum38wa,We must be talking about different things here because Im thinking of roads in general and I think youre talking about city streets and other low speed high population roads. Regardless almost every road  today not in the th century since several people have used that argument already  is designed for cars first theres just no point in trying to deny that. As far as roads being made to facilitate moving people that isnt really true. The majority of freight movement in the US is done by trucks on roads which is a significant reason the road system is built the way that it is and continues to be built the same way. The problem with cycling isnt too many people choosing to drive a car it is purely infrastructure which doesnt exist here because the demand isnt high enough. The danger comes from cyclists choosing to be outliers though admittedly its not much of a choice when there are no other options. This wouldnt be an issue at all if they had the same kind of road network as automobiles obviously but again the US is just too big and spread out for that to be feasible unless everyone started demanding it.A bicycles uses are too limited for it to be the only form of transportation for most people. I know somebody is probably going to link a picture of an entire family on one bike with a trailer full of groceries in a foot of snow to try and prove that statement wrong but you know that just isnt practical. Some people have no need for a car and its definitely a good thing when they choose not to have one but that doesnt change the fact that our entire transportation system is built primarily around having a personal car. If you dont live in a major metropolitan area where everything you need is less than a mile away from you youre going to have a really hard time without  a car.,UpliftingNews,cum6jqf,2,t5_2u3ta

However again you are welcome to break a law to make a point but you must understand that you will still be punished for it thats all. The punishment for Americas refusal to pay British taxes and declare independence was war. What I mean is you cant break a law that you feel is unjust and expect nothing to happen to you because you felt it was unjust. By deliberately breaking a law you are making an example out of yourself. You can certainly try but you wont succeed in trying to sue the government because what you knew would happen happened. If you feel passionately enough about something to break the law to make a point then go ahead but you will also be forced to suffer the consequences. Because your declaration of something as unjust is subjective and is meaningless until it is agreed upon at a higher level.

So if an employee made more than that in wages and got a k bonus then and only then would they be keeping only  of it if you think thats the same as k or that its only a minor error on your part feel free to paypal me the difference. If however they earn a more modestly excessive amount say k a year then it breaks down like this  k in wages Tax  Keep   k bonus Tax  Keep The less money they make obviously the lower the tax burden on that k bonus is.

Letters start splattering the windowsdoorschimney chute. Safyre finally gets ahold of one and out foxes her uncle slipping upstairs into the water heater closet. She opens it with much excitement.

She is lead up to the pyre and bound. Brush is piled underneath her. A man walks up in front as the crowd reaches a crescendo of fury and hate. As he raises the torch Safyre stops panicing and a calm comes over her. The torch bearer is taken back by the small  year olds presence. He regains composure and starts forward before being blown back by a force. Safyre rips free of the binds and smirks before disappearing with a mischievous grin on her face. The town is silent.

The bad news is apparently Im dead. Good news if youre reading this is that you are most definitely not unless they have wifi in the afterlife. Yes this sucks. It sucks beyond words but Im just so damn glad I lived a life so full of love joy and amazing friends. I am lucky to honestly say that I have zero regrets and I spent every ounce of energy I had living life to the fullest. I love you all and thank you for this awesome life.gtWhatever religion brings you comfort I am happy that you have that. However respect that we are not religious. Please please please do not tell Brianna that I am in heaven. In her mind that means that I chose to be somewhere else and left her. In reality I did everything I could to be here with her as there is nowhere NOWHERE I would rather be than with her and Jeff. Please dont confuse her and let her think for one second that is not true. Because I am not in heaven. Im here. But no longer in the crappy body that turned against me. My energy my love my laughter those incredible memories its all here with you. Please dont think of me with pity or sadness. Smile knowing that we had a blast together and that time was AMAZING. I f! hate making people sad. More than anything I love making people laugh and smile so please rather than dwelling on the tragic Terms of Endearment end of my story laugh at the memories we made and the fun we had. Please tell Brianna stories so she knows how much I love her and how proud of her I will always be and make me sound waaay cooler than I am. Because I love nothing more than being her mommy. Nothing. Every moment with her was a happiness I couldnt even imagine until she came crashing into our world.gtAnd dont say I lost to cancer. Because cancer may have taken almost everything from me but it never took my love or my hope or my joy. It wasnt a battle it was just life which is often brutally random and unfair and thats simply how it goes sometimes. I didnt lose dammit. The way I lived for years with cancer is something I consider a pretty big victory. Please remember that.gtMost importantly I was unbelievably lucky to spend over a decade with the love of my life and my best friend Jeff. True love and soulmates do exist. Every day was full of hilarity and love with Jeff by my side. He is genuinely the best husband in the universe. Through all my cancer crap he never wavered when so many people would want to run. Even on the worst days you could imagine we found a way to laugh together. I love him more than life itself and I truly believe that a love like that is so special it will live forever. Time is the most precious thing in this world and to have shared my life for so long with Jeff is something I am incredibly grateful for. I love you Jeff. I believe that the awesomeness that is Brianna is our love brought to life which is pretty beautiful. It absolutely breaks my heart to have to say goodbye. If its half as sad for you as it is for me it breaks my heart over again because the last thing I ever want to do is make you sad. I hope that with time you can think of me and smile and laugh because holy s did we have a breathtaking life. Go google Physicists Eulogy and know that it is a scientific fact I will always be with you both in some way. I know that if you just stop and look hard enough Ill be with there in as noncreepy a way possible. Youre my world and I loved every second we had together more than words.gtFriends I love you all and thank you for the most wonderfully aweinspiring life. And thank you to all of my amazing doctors and nurses who have taken such incredible care of me. I dont doubt that my team gave me every possible good day that they could. From the bottom of my heart I wish all my friends long healthy lives and I hope you can experience the same appreciation for the gift of each day that I did. If you go to my funeral please run up a bar tab that would make me proud. Heck blast Keg on My Coffin and dance on the bar for me because there had better be a dance party at some point. Celebrate the beauty of life with a kickass party because you know thats what I want and I believe that in a weird way I will find a way to be there too you know how much I hate missing out on fun. I look forward to haunting each one of you so this isnt so much a goodbye as it is see you later Please do me a favor and take a few minutes each day to acknowledge the fragile adventure that is this crazy life.

This goes doubly true when you have that feeling against the opinion of doctorsfamily members who have access to the same medical information.By the way I didnt need to add the next part but I wanted to because you made me waste time explaining something so basic which you could have gotten if you had reading comprehension You are an idiot RexInvictus.,UpliftingNews,cyazy1s,0,t5_2u3ta

Poppa manatee comes over and nudges my leg and I reach down and scratch behind the head and under the flipper. It rolls over for belly rubs. Mind you this is not legal at all but whos gonna turn down belly rubs? baby manatee probably about ft long chills next to us as we pet it too. Momma and poppa manatee then drift out about yds away while baby stays near us. We are all loving this up close experience. Then we see the two parents thrash around as the poppa sea cow lurches out of the water and proceeds to mount the other. As unbelievable as it sounds it was even more unbelievable in person. I never even knew how it was possible they could mate but here we were babysitting their child while they got it on.TLDR got duped into babysitting a baby manatee while the parents made sweet love,UpliftingNews,cyrtzu0,1,t5_2u3ta

Basically to say goodbye to his work family. My dad had worked there  yearsI had been to open houses there before. One I can remember was they had the whole plant open running at minimal. I was able to see how bud light was produced from beginning to end. I was a young electrician and let me tell you its an electricians paradise there. It single handedly got me interested in automation which is what I do now. They had Bud Light girls smoking hot LA girls with portable beer carts spread thru the facility. So. I was of age and got to partake in that. Kept it classy tho. They allowed their employees to get  free cases a week and additional cases at .  Cant beat that. I remember helping my dad load those bad boys. Our garage was always full of pallets of beer. My Cuban side of the family liked to have lots of parties and Cubans drink. A LOTA couple years in a row they had their company picnics at magic mountain. I had a blast at those. We lived an hour outside LA so it was cool since it wasnt a huge trip. I loved magic mountain. Still do.  They had picnics at various places that I cant remember the locations but always a blast. One was near Thousand Oaks at a cool ranch and another was basically a festival of rides and games. Went all out. Great food. Always looked forward to themMy dad rarely missed work.

6364564,0,t1_czcw47v,I just passed my  year mark as an LEO in Southern California. Maybe I can give you some insight into just how fucking ridiculous the reporting or internal affairs complaint can be for the mass majority of departments. I have served on IA for almost  years.The way out IA is set up is based on an election system. Nominations are made and a vote is taken by ALL employees of the department since IA handles all complaints whether it be corrections admin or sworn deputy complaints. The reason officersdeputies are hesitant to file complaints is because everything is on record. They write a written report of their complaint and  copies are made. One is given to the accused one to their command and one to IA. There needs to be an established level of anonymity to encourage EVERYONE to say something when they need to which we are in the process of finalizing and approving.I have personally reviewed about a dozen excessive use of force complaints filed by other deputies in which the claims have been COMPLETELY substantiated and proven and the deputy has either been suspended without pay fired or moved to an unarmed desk position. Luckily our department doesnt fuck around with IA stuff and our Sheriff has does extremely well with promoting and hiring superiors who dont allow any bullshit to happen.There are a TON of departments and officers out there who will literally allow their officers to do whatever the fuck they want and get away with it. The entire system is broken. There needs to be a DIRECT avenue in place that takes these reports out of the departments hands completely. If a sergeant or lieutenant is the same one responsible for disciplining a deputy who they hang out with off duty there is no reasonable expectation that anything will be done. There needs to be a system in place where reports can be filed directly with the state Attorney Generals office and an entirely independent investigation be done. Those of us who are adamant and passionate about policing the ETHICAL and MORAL way need a better system for reporting those who are complete and utter fuck heads. As of now most departments are requiring officers to report directly to their superior and  times out of  absolutely nothing is done. Reports being made are rare especially in large departments because that particular watch commander is likely really good friends with the person they are responsible for disciplining. Ive noticed in my experience that smaller departments handle complaints MUCH better than large departments because the chain of command is so small that its likely to get to the top very quickly if nothing is done.TLDR You are right in the fact that making reports isnt hard however making a report rarely gets anything done because the system is so fucked that friends cant be trusted to discipline friends. Reports need to be made to a third party and disciplinary action needs to be carried out and enforced by an independent statelevel entity and the reporter needs to be kept anonymous from anyone in their department to avoid any repercussions. A very basic level of anonymity isnt hard but the responsibility of following up on this shit needs to be taken out of the hands of the department.,UpliftingNews,czd2wxp,9,t5_2u3ta

6374804,0,t1_cze3afk,I found this analogy deeply thought provoking. Inadvertently I think you are arguing against democracy itself. Universal health care can come about from non democratically elected governments I think thats fair to say. And it looks like you also inadvertently expressed that health care is a commodity in the same sense that a television is. Perhaps you think it is. But maybe the best analogy is stealing medicine from someone. Not because of a majority vote because thats an argument for democracy but because medicine should be evenly distributed whereas you bought your medicine yourself. Thats a little more nuanced so excuse me for correcting it. Now Ill respond to it. Whereas in this society everyone gets a pill a day or whatever they need in this society what would be the incentive to steal more pills? To resell them? Well what would be the bLack market price for medicine in a universal health care society in your opinion? High enough to risk jail? On that point if you need more medicine you can more easily afford more because the prices will be affordable for you. Now lets say someone does rob and shoot you for your pills because theyre unbalanced or something. You go to the ER and skip over the headache people and get treated and even if you are down on your luck or rich youll get treated because again your life isnt a television.

But that has to come with the knowledge that youre using a deadly weapon and it may well result in the persons death especially since the fastest and most reliable ways to stop the threat with a gun shots to the heart or central nervous system will also kill the person. Whats important though is that you cannot shoot with the intent to not kill or to wound.

But politically in this decade especially from a Western perspective where you dont see a threat or a crisis in India but you do from essentially the entire Middle East   Pakistan you can see why it would be reasonable to group Pakistan with its neighbors to the west.Edit  Notably the G uses this expanded definition of the Middle East  So for example while parts of western Turkey are a critical part of ancient Greek history Turkey overall can in some context be grouped with others in the region distinct from the West as it stands today.,UpliftingNews,czzsbfg,1,t5_2u3ta

And right now a lot of palestinians live peacefully with the Israli within Israel. The gaza is filled with backward assholes who brought this on themselves. That is what happens when you use concrete given to you by the Israli and instead of rebuilding your houses you use it to build TUNNELS for terrorist attacks.Instead of following the mindset of they are weaker and have a darker tan so ofcourse they are oppressed perhaps its time to realise that the world isnt black and white?

This removes power from the reflex arcs and can be risky for the survival of the organism.  So the animal has the most basic and powerful of feelings fear and pain.Imagine if you will youre a daddy and your son wants to make a poor decision like squish a spider crawling across his bedroom floor  You know better but its a bad idea to force your son to make the right choice because if things go well hell be much better off and much more able to accomplish things with his own understandings of his surroundings.EDIT added link.,UpliftingNews,d25vnc2,3,t5_2u3ta

Ultimately it is a small small fraction of the cost you will ultimately pay to raise a child. It also slightly offsets what you might save by putting the child to work once you take it home.  Adoption isnt exactly like foster care. Eventually the caseworkers go away.  If you can adopt a domestic slave for free at least one person is going to do it. there are bad people out there.

7378639,0,t1_d2gu8zl,There are people out there who would be wonderful parents but cant afford to be it is true.  But there are also loads of awful people out there that children need to be protected from.  There was a Reuters article that was written just after Russia closed adoptions to the US about the widespread phenomenon of rehoming adopted children.  This is often done over online forums and Facebook groups.  Often children are rehomed more than once and NO regulation is used to vet the people taking them and no safeguards in place to ensure the childs welfare. And its legal at least a legal grey area. Less regulation and commitment considerations can allow adults to adopt what can essential be considered domestic slaves. Imagine if you can go adopt a vulnerable  year old at no cost and in no time teach it to do your laundry and wash your floors mow your lawn all while providing it the legal bare minimum.  Once they are allowed to work you can legally seize  their pay checks. Once they become too big of a hassle you can legally sign over guardianship to a stranger you met on Craigslist where now instead of domestic slaves they are potential sex slaves.  Yes fees and regulations suck and theyre do make it hard for good people to provide much needed love for a child.  But you cant look at the world in such an altruistic light either.  These fees and regulations also keep these children out of the hands of bad people of whom they would be better off in the foster care system than in their care. And there are bad people out there.  A lot of them and the bad people are the ones who seek out systems to exploit.  ,UpliftingNews,d2gweqv,3,t5_2u3ta

I still think that markets are a great way to determine the needs of the community and I think money is a simple and efficient way to reward workers for their labor while allowing them to freely purchase items they wish to have etc etc. My main gripe towards capitalism is the idea that proprietors should be entitled to the product of my labor simply because they own the tools I used to create it. Id rather industries be collectively owned and democratically controlled by the people who do the work and not by the person whos only contribution is money. ,UpliftingNews,d2zj23y,3,t5_2u3ta

7615956,0,t3_4jk7in,Here are my twocents For anyone asking about who is going to clean the desks either the teacher that wrote the messages or the students the K kids that I worked with loved to erase whiteboards will probably clean them. Ive never met a teacher that would make a school janitor do it. When youre a teacher the school janitor is your friend and you dont piss them off.  Why use a hashtag in a message to your students? A good teacher finds creative ways to connect to their students. Ive seen people use hashtags to get messages across on Facebook where hashtags dont even work and on Reddit usually used sarcastically. Hashtags are popular in the world of social media kids see hashtags when theyre out in the world and kids like to imitate whats popular. Hashtags are convenient in that they allow you to take an idea boil it down to memorable key words smush those words together and put a  in front of it and have all of this weirdness still mean something. If youre teaching kids using memorable chunks is what you want to do. If something is easy to remember students will use it when they need it. In this case its being used to encourage students while taking a test which is stressful and to help them remember that their hard work will pay off.  Its the end of the school year. This might be one of the last times that this teacher works with these particular students. If youve ever worked with a child for an entire year and youve cared about their academic and personal growth you probably know how necessary it feels to communicate how proud you are of that child. You also know how important it is to inspire and motivate that child so that even when youre not with them during the next school year an important lesson that they learned while in your class sticks with them.  Did this teacher do all of this to sell books gain attention or to get their national board certification? I have no idea. Maybe they did. Or maybe a reporter approached them because the school year is wrapping up people with children know that end of the year testing is going on and an article about a teacher that did something creative to help herhis students during testing would be a relevant and wellreceived news article.

7648441,0,t1_d3bj2iv,There are a lot of myths about the sun and cancer. A very large fraction of melanomas occur in areas that are not frequently sunexposed. Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer basal cell carcinoma is a much less aggressive skin cancer. Sun exposure increases your risk of the latter significantly the former only slightly. Occupational exposure to sun eg a construction worker outside every day has little to no link with melanoma. The real harm comes when youre a white collar guy who spends the entire winter indoors and then you take your family to the Bahamas in March and get sunburned. What is the lesson here? Intermittent sun exposure is bad regular sun exposure may be harmless for most people. Obviously a lot of this will depend on your skin color and how close to the equator you are. I would recommend against a light skinned person spending a lot of time in the noon sun in Miami. At least for people at higher latitudes mortality from all causes is higher for people who avoid the sun. So even if the sun does cause a lot of melanoma and kills a lot of people by giving them cancer chances are it saves more lives through its health promoting effects.

7661583,0,t1_d3d17mv,Aptitude isnt something that can be measured in part because it has so much to do with things that have nothing to do with raw intelligence. Emotional health and plain dumb luck can play an enormous role.In my case I graduated from high school with a . GPA nearly prefect scores on both the SAT and ACT and college credit for scoring highly on  AP classes. By all apparent accounts I had incredible potential. So I went to college in a computer science program for highlyachieving students.But a few years into the program I caught mono from sharing a musical instrument then got bad medical advice to tough it out through it. I was so sick and exhausted I probably should have taken a couple of months off instead! By the end of the semester I had completely burned out dropped my scholarship and spiraled into depression. If you looked at me then my aptitude had suddenly dropped to the point where it was questionable whether I should even be in college and what lowered it so dramatically was just bad luck.Instead of dropping out I started seeing multiple mental health doctors got a lot of support from my friends and family and focused on finishing school at the same time as working through my depression. A lucky ! connection I made during my senior year meant I had professors who were willing to take me on as a graduate student so I continued through to my masters degree continuing to work on my mental health the entire program. And now Im going to graduate with my masters degree in August. What made a difference  what increased my aptitude so to speak  was not a change in my intelligence but rather the support of my doctors friends family and professors as well as the healthy coping skills and emotional intelligence I learned as part of my mental health treatment.So based on my experience I do not think there are any ways to correctly predict anybodys aptitude. Theres no way to predict how lucky or emotionally resilient someone will turn out to be and those play just as much a role in someones success as their intelligence.,UpliftingNews,d3d2u2y,16,t5_2u3ta

Im from Canada and if youve had sex with a new partner whos sexual history you do not know i.e. everyone in the past  months you are not eligible to give blood. So Im assuming all this is doing is lowering the time frame from  years to whatever it is for straight people? In the USA at least Gay people make up  of the population but MSM also account for almost  of new HIV diagnoses every year... Maybe there should be additional precautions? Nothing against gay people but feel strongly about clean blood supply. I remember a heart breaking story a man told my school about how he got HIV from a blood transfusion gave it to his wife amp unborn child. Wife amp child died. Very sad and just kind of highlights how important it is to have clean blood. ,UpliftingNews,d3t9yzj,14,t5_2u3ta

I suppose if you started your own company you could wait until your debt is about to charge off then approach your creditor and buy a batch of debt and hope your debt is in there.  Hope is the key word theres no guarantee.  They wont let you hand pick your debt.  Unless youre the Count of Monte Cristo lol. Your best bet is to wait until its about to charge off  days delinquent before the end of the next month. So if youre  days delinquent on June th then itll charge off around the end of June and then call the company and offer to settle for .

Medical collections like other collections have about the same effect paid or unpaid and medical debt specifically is weighted quite a bit lower in most FICO versions.Paying your collections can be a doubleedged sword. You do get them off your back but by paying it you are acknowledging that you actually are responsible for defaulting and can no longer get it removed. Given that medical collections are some of the easiest to get removed this may not be that great for someone who would want to pursue raising their credit score.It was a nice thing to do regardless.

Although it was very easy for the Black American community to buy into the white people are bad narrative in the earlymid s which Muhammad Ali admittingly did however Ali quickly grew out of that stance when he left nation of Islam along with Malcolm X. You can even see his growth in stance in his later interviews and talks. Muhammad Ali had good relations with many people including many who were white. And for those who didnt read the full article Ali invited her backgt In  he was kind enough to invite my whole family to visit him at his home which was also very special as it meant my disabled father could finally meet his hero.I was telling him how very much I loved him and although he was unable to speak his eyes were alive and he squeezed my hand and hugged me.Yes Muhammad Ali loved me back.

I cannot flex or trigger it in any way.First month or so of replacement you will also feel a slight tilt one way.  I was told its because when you grow you have a slight unevenness. Once replaced into a more exact position it takes time to get used to.The scars also arent great for the first few years and still arent.

Theres a whole lot of difficulties you have to face with being disabled but that doesnt make them any less human or worthy of rights. Being handicapped or disabled shouldnt be looked at as negative. Imagine everyone seeing you as broken because of a physical or mental handicap or disability. The reality is that life is more difficult but the person isnt at any fault or broken because of it.Im sure you wouldnt want to be handicapped or disabled and thats basically what youre saying. I dont think anyone would WANT to have life made more difficult for them. But being disabled isnt something people really get to choose.

Most cats do not drink enough as they usually get most of their moisture from the animals they kill and eat. A life of dry food and no mice leads to heavily taxed kidneys. I wish I had this information years ago too. Im sorry for your loss but maybe I can save you some pain in the future. Feed your cats wet food or raw if you can.

We have less money for food than the average food stamp family has and virtually no clothing budget. I accept giveaways and am handy with my sewing machine. Ill actually make kid clothing out of givenaway XL womens clothing for instance. We do set aside money for things like sneakers and underwear.Yet really you probably couldnt tell. We eat well we just dont eat expensive. The kids are always grabbing apples or bananas out of the fruit bowl for snacks and I buy inseason produce on sale to go along with lowcost staples like rice and potatoes. Some brand or another of bread always goes on sale at the right time that if we store extra loaves in the freezer we always have some for sandwiches etc.I would not have voted for Sanders. Absolutely not. Every single time the government has raised taxes on the rich in order to pay for welfare programs for the poor for some reason we always wind up paying more for what we need being paid less for what we do and just a couple hundred or even a couple dozen dollars per year over the income limit for the new government social programs.Ive long learned by experience that the best thing for us the thing that helps us the most is acrosstheboard tax cuts.

I doubt these voters who came out of the woodwork were registered to the Green party before this election season...Even if prior Republican leaders thought and in lowkey ways enacted upon these thoughts there is a marketed shift between how they and Trump go about it all. Whereas keeping your cool being in control of yourself and working with others used to be desired in candidates Bernie and Trump show that a lot of people want aggressive displays of emotion and as little cooperation with the current people in politics as possible.

I wish my situation would be better I have  a home that I bought so selling that now will be a hassle. I see a lot of the current and next generation trying to get this island back on their feet but unfortunately those are the minorty here... politicians being either american or puertorican will confuse and scare the current generation and older generation and not change things to vote for the same parties because you know how boricuas are with their affiliations to politics. I can go to the states and get a better job but for me personally I just couldnt bear leaving my home behind I lived in the states before and the culture do not mesh with me that much but I dont blame others for leaving if they have to they have to. I just hope that they can see we still have potential we still want things to get better to not throw us in the mud or under the bus but to still believe that the people that have stayed want to make a difference. I hope that we as a culture can come through this with better knowledge and outlook on life that we can take our country and help it grow again. We have the potential we just need to believe accept change and mature as a society.

8669029,0,t1_d6p88zq,gt re you saying that restaurants which have tried this have also set a strict notip policy? As I understand it a restaurant can pay its staff minimum wage but patrons can still tip and will still tip no?Can  most will not.  The idea from the customer is not that the tip is a bonus but that you are paying the wait staff directly and your bill from the establishment is only for the food not the service  you the customer decide how much the service was worth. If the customer knows the service is included in the bill then there is no reason to leave a tip if you receive normal level of expected service. gtif tipping is deeply ingrained in American culture then why cant it just be like in most of the rest of the world where the employer has to pay employees minimum wage themselves a few reasons but while many countries have these types of min wage laws it is not factually correct to say the rest of world  America for the most part has an cultural basis against government which is different than many EU nations which is what your comparing the US to where the government is either viewed as a Partner or protector or in some cases citizens are subjects of the government.  To the average American the government is an adversary.  As a libertarian I agree with this view of government.  I personally am against the very concept of a min wage of any type.  I set what I am willing to work for not the government. So for the government to inject itself in the transaction between employee and employer is viewed as unneeded and offensive to many. As long as no fraud or coercion is being conducted  the government should not be involved This individualism vs collectivism is the primary difference between European and American culture ,UpliftingNews,d6p8yxx,2,t5_2u3ta

That would include indeffinate detention. What the media reported this as is if the government decides you are a terrorist you can be locked up without trial.The original law was passed in  so its not new and the Obama administrations implementation procedure afforded several conditions under which to waive detention by armed forces rather than law enforcement.

Like how we dont hate alcoholics but we do hate alcoholism. We want gay people to go to heaven and God says to do that you need to repent from your sins and as homosexually being described as a sin in the Bible they would go to hell. We believe that if we can get them to see that it is sin and they repent they will go to heaven.Its sometimes hard to see the line between hate wanting them to go to heaven even some Christians hate gay people like in shoot them hate.

An additional method is to use ticketless entry and require the purchaser be the one in attendance and the credit card is scanned to permit entry and a paper printout w your location is printed after you enter the venue.Would be the stupidest thing to actually go back and repurchase broker tickets when there are so many possible ways to limit  restrict this in the first place.,UpliftingNews,d7gofxh,1,t5_2u3ta

Starvation among the homeless population would be very difficult to track I would think because exposure to the elements would probably kill them first.  Someone who is starving to death will probably die freezing to death before the starvation takes them.  Even if they did die of starvation I dont think the M.E. is going to spend much time looking into the matter and just assume the exposure was the cause.After researching some news articles on the matter it seems that most of the starvation deaths that do occur are . Intentional as in the case of murder or anorexia .

Hives everywhere extremely swollen eyes lips nasal cavity.Worried she might suffocate given that SO and I share a car and we dont live near the ER vet I made sure I was following all road rules so I wouldnt get pulled over and delay her trip to the vet. Twenty seconds after making sure I wasnt speeding I saw the red and blue flashing lights and heard a siren. My feather foot had turned to lead in that little time.I pulled over looked for my license and registration but it turns out that I had neither. My wallet had fallen out of my purse and my registration was MIA after cleaning my car.That cop must have been a dog person because after i explained everything he let me go with a warning and told me to drive more carefully. Im so thankful. I was home in  minutes and had my dog to the vet in . Everything turned out okay thanks to that nice cop.,UpliftingNews,d849xlv,1,t5_2u3ta

Bullying is bad and its good that authorities are trying to find a mechanism to fight it.Consider though the following informed by a few years of experience practicing law in the U.S. criminal justice system one states courts and federal courts here. Bullying is a vague term. What if the parent or even the majority of people disagree that what happened is bullying? Is there due process like any charge? Can it be fought in court? Is bullying defined by statute in this jurisdiction? From the articles wording ...It is directed toward someone that is using social media and saying things in an attempt to discredit hurt or demean a person. it just seems like theyre making it a slight variation on a defamation claim which is typically a civil issue.. More to the point...the article says this is a  fine. Bullies frequently come from abusive or impoverished homes. We have to consider that sending a bully home costing his parents almost  might be risking further or worse abuse to that child or severe financial distress for poor families thats a month of groceries. A good idea but I have some real concerns with practical implementation of a law like this one.,UpliftingNews,d8cri4w,7,t5_2u3ta

Over the next  years the negated greenhouse effect of the reduction will be worth  years of carbon dioxide emissions. Good progress we need more of this but not world saved level stuff yet.

9349092,0,t1_d911grw,I still have a bunch of my old ponies too! Theyre mostly stored in boxes right now though because this apartment has...its not got much storage space. I cant wait to move out. I used to gift ponies to people too Im sure they were thrilled! It sorta bit me in the butt though when I went through a huge depression patch and fell out of collecting every birthday or Christmas my one friend would always always give me ponies ahaha! He gave me the Blue Hot Topic Discord though that was cool! I never saw that episode maybe I should watch it...Reddit was wild that week all the top posts were about Bowie. It was sad but also really cool in a way to see just how important he was to so many people! A lot of people straight up mourned him and anyone who pulled that how can you mourn someone you didnt know crap was INSTANTLY shut down. Like...we never met him but he was a massive force in so many peoples lives. He was a damn hero to so many people for so many years and he was talented to boot. So talented. He collaborated with a lot of people and so many artists list him as an influence SPG included actually. I just...ugh Bowie!Picking a fave Bowie is tough...Ive always had an attachment to the entirety of hours... though because as a kid my dad played Dreamcast with me and later gave me it and one of the games I played was Omikron! You could buy Bowie songs in that game and he was like...three different characters it was great. The controls were awful though. You can buy it on Steam! When he passed away they actually gave the game away for free as a memorial. I would have nabbed it but I already had it on Steam. Oh Diamond Dogs is great too. I hated being forced to read and dissect books in school but  managed to survive me developing a hatred for it and I kind of became obsessed. So Diamond Dogs was the coolest thing combining this awesome book and my favorite artist like that! Its really hard to pick faves though...Oh yes the videos are good! Very budget but very good its such a treat to watch them move! So you dont get confused about the members They started busking with four members The Jon The Spine Rabbit and Upgrade. Upgrade was a female robot who left the band to act instead and was played by Erin Burke. Youll mostly only see her in old busking videos. The Jon was in the band for the first two albums but left due to differences with schedules and stuff. Hes the gold robot with long hair. He was replaced by Hatchworth the redheaded bronze robot with a moustache. Hes played by Sam Luke who was previously a human band member in the first two albums. You can spot him easily. Then the other two who have always been there are the identical twins David and Isabella Bennett playing The Spine and Rabbit respectively. The Spine is the silver robot with the deep voice. Rabbit youll note as you watch is a male robot in older videos but a female robot in newer videos. Shes a transgender woman thats why! So if thats a little confusing thats why. Her design changes a lot but shes a copper robot underneath. Currently she has a white face plate though. Also theres other characters a whole backstory a comic a bunch of lore...a lot to get into.The most classic video of theirs is Brass Goggles for sure. Honeybee is also a very wellknown one. My fave videos are Fancy Shoes and Star Scrap though Rabbits movement in that one is so good... The most recent one is Malfunction featuring a lot of fans holding up signs saying what their malfunction is! There are a few autistic people in it and I thought about submitting a video for it but Im shy...now I regret not doing so though. Their newest album is very positive and uplifting! DI checked out your music too! mc chris is nerdy music huh? As soon as I heard him I realised youre definitely the kind of person one can probably info dump about singing robots to ahaha! I really like the smooth sounding vocalist of Her Space Holiday... I havent seen the video for The Only Difference Between Martyrdom but I definitely remember the song! P!atD was one of my fave jams in high school! I sure as heck remember the video for I Write Sins Not Tragedies though who doesnt?Eeee Im really enjoying chatting with you!

9641047,0,t1_da1ex6z,Ill admit that I also had a declawed cat growing up that as far as I could tell was never terribly bothered by it. However declawing is not a solution for behavior issues.  of cases of cats clawing things is them not having enough or in a lot of cases any healthy clawing options i.e. a scratching post. Some cats are pickier about material than others. The other  is training.  And even if you think thats too much effort declawing often causes more behavior issues than it solves. Many declawed cats paws ache for the rest of their lives and this ache can be exacerbated by... kitty litter. So they may have litter box issues and though opinion may vary on this I personally have found that to be more destructive than scratching.  Cats that are declawed are also much more prone to biting since they lack the defense of claws. Anecdotally my declawed cat was much more mouthy than the two intact cats I have now are And while you may have heard about Cat Scratch Fever and the risk of infection of scratches its quite rare while cat bites on the other hand get infected  of the time.  So you could argue that declawing the cat would make it more adoptable but then you risk it being brought back for pooping everywhere or it having to be put down for biting someone. Much better would be to just emphasize the importance of having a scratching post.  ,UpliftingNews,da1ghbf,38,t5_2u3ta

If were going to have capitalism at all for Gods sake lets have the regulated kind because the unregulated kind is unthinkable especially at this stage of history. The economics that you keep citing is pure theory and also pure ideology. It has nothing to do with the real world. Theres no need to keep explaining the theory to me because I understand the theory. But the theory is incorrect. I notice also that youre ignoring my points about the historical and current violence of capitalism. You cant wriggle out of it by saying that wasnt really capitalism.

Im atheist as is my wife and extended family for that matter.  We lived together for  year before getting married and have been married for  more.  Marriage is an extra level of commitment.  It IS different to de facto.  Does it give me different tax breaks?  No.  Does my wife act differently in any specific way?  No.  But its now a formalised arrangement.  Paperwork is involved.  Promises were made and made publicly.It makes sense to me because I like the idea of having a team mate for life.  De facto isnt that or wasnt for me.  De facto is having a team mate for while its convenient.  To me it feels like the same difference between a verbal agreement and a signed contract about something.  Its just another level of commitment.  I didnt marry because I think a sky fairy will be mad if I get laid without it  I got married because the good things that come from the woman I found are valuable enough to me that I signed paperwork to ensure its protection and existence as much as is possible.

9886217,0,t1_davqmot,If they were actually going  renewable then that would be something. The reality of the matter is that they are buying nominal capacity from the grid... and thus on the paper with very generous assumptions and cornercutting you get Google running on  renewable energy. It assumes that one could earmark electrcity and say where his electricity is coming from but in real life and engineering you cannot make such assumptions. Thats not how the grid operates.The challenge of the electric grid and electricity in general isnt about netproducing enough of electricity. Its about producing electricity when we need it in right amounts. Not too much not too little. Because renewables produce electricity only when the conditions to do so are met they arent really suitable for grid use. Some of it up to  depending on circumstances can be used in the grid because the rest of the power generation can adjust to make up for the intermittency of renewables but the higher you start going at it the more expensive and impractical it becomes effectively necessitating huge amounts of backup power generation.Thus to make up for renewables you have to either a have the ability to store electricity at a grid scale for sufficient periods of time or b use some alternative power generation source which can quickly adjust production on demand generally fossil fuel sources. Because battery technology including Teslas Powerwall are insufficient for this the option a is not feasible with current technology.Thus the only thing left is option b... and well Germany  Denmark havent been doing all too well with that emissions reduction thing.,UpliftingNews,daw742j,3,t5_2u3ta

Is not the responsibility of black people or white people to fix racism its the responsibility of the people who want it gone from the world.And he did a great thing no one has taken that away from him but he is an exception and not a rule. This story could have very easily ended with Black man who reached out to KKK is murdered by them to send a message THAT is the fear that black people carry and the reason why black people reading this thread shake their head when they see comments like yours that imply that the burden is on blacks to step into these communities filled with people who want them dead for nothing other than ignorance fear and embedded mindsets.gt Its funny that this thread is full of people whining I dont mean you here about Why is it our job?. Unlike you those people dont want to admit that they dont want to do it. They want to shift the responsibility. No its not fair no you shouldnt have to do it and you dont. But we live in an imperfect world with imperfect people. If you want change its up to you.For me its even funnier that this thread is filled with people who have decided to take a stance that its easy to sit back and go You guys dont like being gunned down and not receiving justice even when you go through the systems this country has put in place to give you that justice you seek? Well thats too damn bad maybe if youd hit the concrete and talked to more white people and showed them that youre not all that bad it wouldve gone better for you. which sure. Maybe for you thats not what youre trying to say. For you it might be that you want people to think that maybe talking things out and reaching a mutual understanding is the best way to achieve peace. And in a perfect world where people withheld judgments and were open to expanding their mental horizons you would be right. But as you said yourself this world is imperfect and injustices such as black people being killed without due justice permeate American society so to expect black people to risk these things just for the offchance that they stumble upon a racist person who is willing to change their mindset is absolutely ridiculous.The burden lies on the racist to reach out to the group they want to change their thoughts on because the racist is far SAFER in that situation than the person who is hated. If your message was when you are reached out to by someone looking to educate themselves and you turn them away in order to fight fire with fire you have become compliant in the problem then Id be with you but your message is telling black people to do what this man has done to put themselves at HIGH risk for the chance that they meet a group of racists who are willing to educate themselves and change their view point and that is not a worthy risk for them to take. Their life is far more important than playing russian roulette with a bunch of racists and hoping to come out clean on the other side.,UpliftingNews,dbhgbg1,1,t5_2u3ta
10049370,0,t1_dbhf0f5,Nope let me tell you something Im part Irish Scottish Polish German and large swabs of my others side of the family is Jewish and one generation live in china before coming to the US earning all kinds of ire. My great great grandfather on my fathers side was hated by many for giving his rail way workers rights when they demanded them. My great grandfather on my mothers side threw a way a fortune investing in preservation methods for medicen and food so that all could eat fresh healthy things. My mother was in MLKjrs march and in one of the first schools to be intergrated. My grand mother on my mothers side ran the republicans in her state under an Iron cane which they still fear after a decade from her death. My family has seen oppression from bigots of all shapes and sizes. and what you claim is happening just now to white people has happened all the time to anyone and everyone. Its the bubbles in the great melting pot we call the United States. But for a while in the s and s we were finally embracing MLKjr. We saw past skin color and saw character. Then sjws came along and started up Malcom Xs divisive bullshit causing more racism to increase to levels we havent seen since my mother was a child.That is why Im pissed off with this nonsense.

Yeah.In  a study was done of New Orleans bars which showed both that black folks got charged more for drinks and cover regularly but were subject to dress code regulations which were just not applied to white folks.In my lifetime I have been to gatherings where it was open among the people there that any black person they saw would be beaten.  I myself have a chunk of fake tooth from where I got a tooth broken by bigots for being gay and Im not even gay.  Many of my friends still say they avoid places like Livingston Parish because they just dont feel safe there.  In  I got the pleasure of having trucks full of full on redneck racist fuckers tail us out of their town my little brother is half black.  I guess I inspire some kind of racist confidence too because a number of racists have opened up to me about it people you wouldnt expect.  The cops here are racist by and large.  The rich white half of our city just tried to split off from the poor black half and form their own city.This shit is real and people seem to not get that.

10050757,0,t1_dbhmd8d,gt Its a treatable illness. And racists are able to become nonracists. And in both cases it helps alot if you give them reason to change.gtAnd my ultimate point is we gain nothing by tip toeing around these peoples feelingsAnd tip toeing around their feelings is not the goal there. Educating them and challenging their views is. A concept which is not aided by the admittedly cathartic act of being callous towards them.gtPlus they are the ones complaining the world has gotten to PC  so why bother being politically correct?Because you are not them and by your attitude you dont want to be like them?gtAt the end of the day why should we be so concerned with the feelings of bigots racists and their apologists  when they show no such concern for anyone else?Because again youre not them. Secondly because those feelings are the key that might turn them from being racist. Maybe they lost someone in . Maybe they or someone they know got beat up by a black gang. Maybe they just dont know any better. And maybe that could change if someone challenged their views.Now you could rebut by going we live in the information age surely they could just learn their views are false over the internet. But have you ever browsed Stormfront or Breitbart with the intention of legitimately learning about their views? I would wager not.

Yes its inconvenient and if racial bias is the motivation as stipulated in this hypothetical then its totally unfair. What if a similar action occurred for nonracial reasons but someone plays the race card makes a youtube video about being discriminated against and gets a bunch of social justice warriors to call into the place of employment and get the person fired? Or what if the consequences arent that extreme but you malign a person with no good evidence that their actions were motivated by racial bias?In truth I really dont think implicit bias is much of a problem. Academic opinion is conflicted on the matter and the studies supporting the idea are quite weak relying on silly tests with methodological errors from what Ive seen.gt What happens when those mechanics and software engineers get promotions or its time to write a letter of recommendation?Then you have a senior software developer who believes that asians have the highest average IQ or whatever the belief in question is. So what? It doesnt mean they are going to treat me badly as an individual just because Im not asian.If you are good at your job and are pleasant to work with even the average casual racist isnt going to care what color you are. Black youth unemployment was equivalent to and sometimes lower than white youth unemployment back in the late s and early s when there were significantly more racists both implicit and explicit in the work force.gt And then sometimes when people of color try and point out the racism we deal with on a regular basis we get shot down and told its not real because white people dont see it.Not seeing the evidence for something isnt exactly a bad reason to be skeptical it is there. Not that absence of evidence is always evidence of absence or anything but if you want to convince me that a particular inconvenience youve had to deal with was motivated by racism Im going to require evidence.Not trying to demean any experiences you might have had but I think there are plenty of cases where people play the race card even when it isnt applicable.

10197965,0,t1_dbzq6o2,Most grocery stores do something similar to this. I used to work for Walmart Stores. Although Kroger is ranked as the largest grocer in the United States Walmarts sales in grocery dwarf it by a large margin. I only had two Division One stores non grocery in my market. The rest were SuperCenters meaning they sold grocery. At the time that I was still with the company many items that approached the sell by date would be frozen and sent to Feed America. This wasnt done with meat that went out of date as the company had a contract to send that to secondary processors basically dog food companies. So there is a large amount of food that does go to people who need it. It makes sense because you could either take a mark down to zero on it and absorb the loss or donate it and get a taxable deduction for the cost of the item.Outside of corporate policy and deduction capture Id imagine that most people dont do this out of acknowledgment of human behavior. If you give food away for free word spreads and then you have a larger crowd to feed. Then the crowd starts hanging around during non free food times which could lead to issues. Also you could run into issues when you dont have enough food to feed everyone. I remember when I was at IU there was a bagel shop near campus that would discard their bagels at the end of every night. I dont remember its name but it was right next to Steve and Barrys if anyone went there and can remember.That place would do no sales after five because everyone knew they could come at seven and get bags of free bagels. Once word  got out that window of no business got larger until they eventually stopped giving out the bagels. That caused a lot of bad blood and then they went out of business. It would probably be the same store with the homeless and grocers.,UpliftingNews,dbzzv6b,2,t5_2u3ta

And you got paid holiday pay if youd been there for  months and they even asked if youre ok with a long shift or if youd prefer a short shift. And they actually used that information to make the schedules for those days I actually worked  hours the week of Thanksgiving because I said I was happy working long shifts all week. Everyone I worked with was kinda lost though because usually if you worked a minute over  youd get called into the back room and get your ass chewed out. Combine that overtime with Holiday pay and even though it was minimum wage I made just over a grand that week. And  right before Christmas as an  year old was amazing. ,UpliftingNews,dcx9qub,1,t5_2u3ta

Im saying that suggesting women are catching up to men in any way by finally achieving blank could conversely make young women think that they have to overcome adversity to achieve that they recognize women dont usually do this maybe theres a reason for that.I think its wonderful that a womens first achievement could inspire young women to persevere.

10616530,0,t1_ddausrx,Yes they would. A lot of Americans are not organ donors because they have the option not to be one. Also awareness about organ donation isnt very widespread in the US. The Dutch government created awareness by broadcasting a fake reality TV show where contestants in need of a kidney transplant competed for a womans kidney. Within a month more than  people had requested paperwork to become organ donors. Belgium Poland Portugal France and some Asian countries have optout policies that make organ donor status automatic upon a persons death unless they refuse beforehand. This helps save many lives in those countries.   Even if you are an organ donor in the United States and you clearly state before your death that you want your organs harvested for transplant your next of kin can deny the procedure and the organs are left with the body regardless of the deceaseds wishes. ,UpliftingNews,ddb0jik,3,t5_2u3ta

10994333,0,t1_dedvvsu,Resorting to name calling eh? I may be a pretentious twat but Im also a practicing LCSW with extensive postgraduate training in treating anxiety disorders and complex trauma. I also recently completed multiple postgraduate trainings in MBCT and MBSR. The research is quite clear mindfulness based interventions result in clinically significant reductions in symptoms. Now youre going to call me a twat again so Ill just link some of the researchMa SH et al find significant reductions in symptoms of MDDTeasdale et al find significant reductions in relapse rates of MDD symptomsThis meta analysis by Hoffman et al finds that MBCT is moderately effective in reducing symptoms of GADLovas amp Barsky find clinically significant reductions in symptoms of health anxiety and improvement at  month followupKing et al find significant reductions in PTSD symptoms among veterans in this studyHaydicky et al find reductions in inattention and conduct problems in youth with ADHDThe research is there. All it takes is a cursory search to uncover the studies. Now I will readily acknowledge that more FMRI studies are needed. However this is true across the MH world  most major models of treatment are lacking in research using FMRI. MBCT is no exception. But there has been research of this type performedIts been over  years since KabatZinn started his first MBSR program. Theres a reason that mindfulness is becoming popular now its been manualized studied and proven effective. MBCT is not just group process therapy as the skills taught are meditative and the homework assigned is relevant. The same is true for MBSR. Funny that you accuse me of attempting to brow beat people and yet you call me a twat in your first sentence. PS Ive reviewed your comment history. It seems the vast majority of your comments are attempts to prove others wrong mostly failed and efforts to start arguments.

I have no doubt he wouldve been murdered if I hadnt adopted him. They neutered him and he developed abscesses on his penis and scrotum as a result of the neutering. Our vet said he should not have been neutered in the condition he was in. Before they realized he had the immune issue our vet gave him an antibiotic injection for kennel cough and he developed an abscess at the injection site. He scratched this one open himself! Scared the shit out of me but he was fine. He has a tiny scar there now I tell him he should use it to get da bitches and say he got it in a fight with a rotweiler and they should see the rotweiler. He doesnt do that though. Anyway he was on a medication for the immune problem for a while but hes been off of it for at least a year now and doing just fine. The vet says the problem may well have been stress induced. The SPCA says he was a stray so presumably he was on his own for a while before they found him. When I adopted him he weighed  lbs. He was severely underweight. You could see his ribs and spine. Hes now about  lbs which is a good weight for him. I say hes getting a bit fat. Haha. ,UpliftingNews,dehyeex,1,t5_2u3ta

In the meantime to reduce anxiety have the rest of the class split into guilds and share their adventures maybe either reading out loud or participating in a discussion. And of course to maybe help guarantee theyll pay attention to each other and actually discuss select a champion from each guild to compete against the other guilds to win some sort of prize. The guild tournament could consist of answering questions about teammates depending on topic or just generally being able to respond succinctly. Since the champions are chosen at random it should hopefully encourage the students in the guild to help each other with anything they have difficulty with and also pay attention which is also really helpful because teaching is the best way to learn. For those who prefer to write organise activitiesassignments into threes with a required oral activity a required written activity and have the third be up to the student.Also crafting fairs. Each guildvillage has been given a royal proclamation that says the ruler would like to see the subjects create  and present them.

If a woman cant decide when she wants to get married or when she first has sex that is societal issue and a rape issue both of which need to be resolved and are a part of a bigger problem than just the choice to have a child.I see what point youre trying to make but the statement was I think obviously but maybe not directed at a more civilized world than what you may be thinking of.,UpliftingNews,deqllou,1,t5_2u3ta

Grieving differently or b. Having difficulties grieving is pretty shit IMO. Saying this has nothing to do with empathy then going off to say you efficiently dealt with your grief in one month is honestly bizarre and jarring.My aunt and cousins still put out flowers where my  year old cousin was stabbed randomly and left to die one year ago. They go to therapy but something about their sonbaby brother being brutally murdered..I guess they arent completely over it yet and who could blame them. They are not the exception either  most of these altars involve a pretty brutal tragedy and to look down on people who make them is honestly repugnant to me.

11809622,0,t1_dgynb2m,Im fine with that while obviously many disagree. They should live with the guilt. Thats how you learn through experience not to do something such as that and become a better person from it. Ive done awful things and Ive apologized but that doesnt mean what I did wasnt an awful thing. I still feel guilty as I should but its helped me become a better person who doesnt do those things. Apologizing doesnt change what happened to whomever youre apologizing to. ,UpliftingNews,dgyntw8,1,t5_2u3ta
