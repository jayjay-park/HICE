Be sure to back up those files first before you overwrite.      If youd like to change the masterserver manually you can check out  this thread.      ,WheelOfTimeGame,d44otca,2,t5_3d7d6

I did manage to find a copy online however but the cutscenes are in Russian.  Regardless here is a screen shot of the filenames     Those go in a folder called Movies in the WheelOfTime folder.  Hope that helps.      ,WheelOfTimeGame,d4csuz7,2,t5_3d7d6
