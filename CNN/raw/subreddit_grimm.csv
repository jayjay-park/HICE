44117,0,t3_1ucpn2,A surprisingly good episode. At least partly because it returned in format to the type of case from the first season but with better characterization. Ill miss Dima... I mean Boris. It took me until after the episode ended to realize I recognized him from Royal PainsrRoyalPains.I was a bit surprised that that was the cliffhanger they chose to end the episode on but Im intrigued to see where this subplot will go.EDIT For those who want to know more about the Russian fairytale about Koschei heres the Wikipedia page for The Death of Koschei the Deathless which is what the opening quote is from.,grimm,cejgcr4,3,t5_2ssvu

Thats going to be the topic of the next show in February. Trubel left at the end of the last show with Josh the son of the old grimm that died who wanted to see nick to give him the key before he died. Josh is not a grimm so she could help him because people were after him. We may not see her again for a while.

Doesnt quite make sense in context honestly...Anyway that was an intense episode. I thought it was pretty good even though it ended on a cliffhanger. That nightmare sequence scene was... worrying. I think most people had a feeling it was a dream but we werent quite sure until Rosalee woke her up and said it.Wus finally part of the gang! He still isnt quite comfortable with everything but its nice to have him know the truth now. Lets hope the writers dont torment him further.I can understand why Juliette didnt tell Nick about whats happening to her right after he says Monroes been kidnapped... She figures her problem can be dealt with afterwards. I just hope the writers dont drag it out.But man what a cliffhanger.

3858758,0,t1_cqvw79k,As for how they tell a Grimm from a human Idk. Thats a good question. But a Hundjger could easily woge so that the Royals could see that it is in fact a Hundjger. Humans can see certain woges mostly when the Wessen wants it to be seen or when theyre in the socalled full woge which everyone can see. Dianes royal blood is important presumably because a person of nonroyal blood shouldnt inherit the throne. Though typically a bastard cant either.

Which is why I was looking for their scythe symbol somewhere.I also agree that the best thing they could have done is have left no trace at all so Nick had no clue anything had happened at the house aside from it being scouted by a Hundjager. Leaving Kellys head in a box might send a message but if it took  Wesen ambushing an unsuspecting older woman trying to protect a child from harm to bring Kelly down pissing off Nick is probably not the best idea since hes taken down everyone theyve sent his way and they also have to know he doesnt handle his business alone. I agree its disrespectful but its up their with staring down the barrel of a gun when it appears it has misfired in terms of sensible things to do.

As such you have  months delay on some shows while they are finishing out the recording of the second half of the season.

Hell hank is about the only one left right? Who else is a human we care about? EVERYONE is wesen or superpowered until they are not.It is some of the sloppiest writing in terms of coherency Ive ever subjected myself to. And compromising integrity is not oh we wont show a boob or we will edit out that nip slip and tone down the curse words.

Eves logic was that the thing in the mirror was coming for her and probably Nick and she didnt want anyone else to get caught in the crossfire. So she decided to go face him on his turf and keep everyone else out of it. But even so the way this was setup and executed was pretty lame. Another example of poor decision making was Nick digging up the stick. They knew that it was something powerful and dangerous that Crusader Grimms had buried for a reason and it wasnt like they were racing against anyone to find it. Going treasure hunting just for the sake of it especially with the whole Black Claw thing going on made very little sense. ,grimm,dfjcnq3,4,t5_2ssvu

Since the initiation of the Royals arc the show has been all over place. I dont think they even knew what to do with that Arc so it just went away as best they could. The insistence on making Juliette a main character was the beginning of the end as far as coherence. I still enjoy the show visually and its fun for what it is but I cant help but feel deflated for what should have been a much much better show.

Nick from Universe goes to another portal to find Eve. Nick returns to Universe and everyone dies. Nick enters another portal and ends up in Universe right after Nick leaves and all is good. Nick then returns to Universe and when everyone dies in this one either he goes to Universe if he beats the demon or if he loses then it could be Nick going to Universe.So based on this in half the universes everyone remains dead while the other they are alive.

11436330,0,t1_dfs83h1,gt its about her relation to the lead character. It did hurt emotionally but it also felt like a plot device like she got killed so that Nick could angst over her death and drive the plot forward. Even Trubel was all like Nick its a trap theyre trying to bait you into going after them!!.Ok so...The relation thing plays out to the fact that his mom was a Grimm. It would be weirder if they didnt take her head since they took her head after the car crash. It also mirrors the episode where he sent two heads to the... Verrat? I cant really remember tmi over a short period.That being said the emotional impact was there but instead of being a typical villanous plot it was basically Juliette doing the ONLY thing she could never come back from and of course she came back from it because... urgh.

Samurai Jack was an animated show that aired for four seasons and was unceremoniously put on hiatus and then canceled.  This was despite it being one of the most highly reviewed and well received shows of the time.  Even now it is one of the best animated shows to be made in more than a decade.  I was one of the original fans who eagerly awaited for each new show to premier.  I was saddened when I learned of its fate.  Well after  long years Samurai Jack is back!  It has taken more than a decade but it is finally going to get an ending.  Keep the interest alive.
