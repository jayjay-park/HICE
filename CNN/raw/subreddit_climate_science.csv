9834783,0,t1_dapfzgo,I wish I could be as positive as you are after spending a few years in the climate debate.gt They dont want to be misled. They only use trusted sources.This does not follow. They trust the trusted sources to say what one has to say as a good group member. Notice how climate sceptics continually accuse others of tribalism? That is because that is the world they know.All things being equal people will prefer realitybased information but other considerations are more important for many people including their politics and the opinions of their peers. Trust is very important to hold a society together and the level of distrust that has been created in America is worrisome. Getting money out of politics may help some. Politicians having to lie for their donors and media picking up this lie as a legitimate opinion because a politician said it is the starting point for much misinformation partisan mud slinging loss of trust and friction. ,climate_science,daphtcx,1,t5_36ywi
