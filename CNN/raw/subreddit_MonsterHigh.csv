6214131,0,t1_cyvtmp4,OK I will say you might wanna get a spare dollarms because they dont have jointed arms they have static ones which is what I plan to do for my Raven. So far they have Apple Raven and Ashlynn.  Heres a link!! My plan for Raven is to smoke out her eyes give her a vampy lip and longer hair in her deep plums purples and such possibly a high ponytail possibly long layers still debating and a pair of faux leather leggings and a motorcycle jacket. I will sketch her up when I am not feeling run over by a truck but I really DO like the corset look on them? Just not the skirts and such. The Tiara I will repurpose.
