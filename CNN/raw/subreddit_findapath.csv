419534,0,t1_cfo6qrl,Alright so you shouldnt have an overwhelmingly difficult time getting into the colleges you listed for two reasons. First you are going to be an in state student so itll be easier for you to apply for in state colleges. Second you seem like someone who is trying to make themselves look better by taking AP classes. Its not important if you passed them or not its important that you put effort into something you otherwise wouldnt have. If you dont end up having the GPA or class rank that you wanted its still okay because the universities should let you make up for them through your SAT or ACT scores as well as written essays. By the way it sounds you are trying pretty hard to get into college and Im sure thatll show through your essays and even test scores. Remember you can retake SAT and ACT if you want to. Also after you get in remember that its not about how smart you are but your ability to edit if you feel like you need more information on something specific let me know. ,findapath,cfo90rd,2,t5_2wqq6

You should look at AVID roles or AYAD but I believe they are being absorbed into AVID basically volunteering overseas but with a decent expense allowance. They have all kinds of roles but Im sure someone with an IT degree and international volunteering experience would be suitable for some of them. Placements are anywhere from  months to a year or more. Also I know a guy in IT and I think the place he works for is a non profit? He helps out with one of the places I volunteer for. I can look it up but its probably only relevant if youre in Aus. That said theres definitely IT work in the non profit sector theres just not a huge amount of money in it compared to for profit companies.

495201,0,t3_1zqyn5,Make a plan and stick to it. Its great that you have enthusiasm now but its easy to lose if things dont pan out the way you want or you just enjoy doing nothing for a bit. For a bit is fine no longer than that. Here are some generic ideas you can personalize themVolunteer  This isnt always as easy as it sounds. It can be difficult to find a place. Most places have applications you need to fill out and it can make the process tedious. Just dont expect to pick one place show up and say hey let me do something. Even if it takes a while its better than doing nothing. Read  pick some books youve been meaning to read for a while classics you never got around to popular fiction youve been hearing a lot about just pick something and read. I would recommend a book a month. PM if you want to discuss or go to rbooks.Exercise  get into a an exercise routine and spend this year getting in the best shape of your life. Run a race K halfmarathon fullmarathon your choice.Get a job  in a perfect world a job related to the field youre interested in. That might be very difficult because of the job market right now. If you cant then just get a job. Make money and heres the important part SAVE money. Start a Roth IRA try to save enough to max out your contribution. Travel  I know this goes against what I just said but if you do it right it doesnt have to. Do your research find a deal someplace cheap it doesnt even have to be international but go somewhere see something new eat something different. Youd be surprised at how little time you will have later on in your life to do this. Regarding schoolIf you plan on going to environmental science start looking for jobs you can get in that field after you graduate. Learn what entrylevel positions there are what the salaries are like and where these jobs exist. Determine if going to grad school is the next logical step for furthering your career or securing the job you actually want. Start researching grad school programs NOW. Look at your current college as well. Are there labs you can join? Who is working on projects you might be interested in? Meet with them in the semester before you are starting back. Tell them about your interests and secure a place in their lab. This will help you gain experience to put on your resume as well as prepare you for graduate school should you choose to go.Best of luck.,findapath,cfwk3sd,1,t5_2wqq6

533914,0,t3_208kmc,I started in Computer Engineering because my adolescent brain wanted to earn the title engineer. My second semester I had a friend who was in a major that my university called Management Information Systems MIS. This is very similar to what other universities may call Computer Information Systems CIS. One difference is MIS was in the business college! I never thought I would be getting a business degree when I went off to college but after I switched I loved it.Any way that a computer can help a business or its bottom line there is a place for an MIS graduate. This includes databasing data storage data warehousing data processing reporting business intelligence backend web application development server infrastructure and computer networking along with any part of the systemsoftware development lifecycle SDLC for any application that a company use.MIS people are translators. They speak the language of the techdumb businesssavvy managers and the language of the techsavvy people such as engineers or computer scientists. MIS people put the project requirements from the execs into nerd speak for the people with less social skills no offense peoples! and they know how to put the capabilities and progress of the technical people into terms that are meaningful to the business managers.If you dont want to sit in a cubicle or be a closetmonkey all day pouring over lines of code computer science might not be for you. If you can see your love for debate translating to anything like participating in a business meeting MIS may be good for you.I will happily answer any questions.,findapath,cg0yo6n,2,t5_2wqq6
552378,0,t1_cg31mk2,How bad? TBH neither of them have really complicated math. It wouldnt even reach high school math. They have their own formulas to follow.In contrast I was really good at math but I am really bad at accounting and finance. Accounting and finance the most advanced math is multiplying really. You use your finance calculator most of the time regardless. From what I can judge from the required intro courses we had to take Accounting is a lot like the word problems in math class. Its more about how to do something test wise. Accounting itself is more about financial reporting. Its about the same for finance. As long as you know what to do you can eventually figure it out on you calculator. If you hateddidnt get word problems in high school I wouldnt recommend those two. Most business schools make you take both of their intro courses in accountings case two regardless so you can always switch around then hopefully your school allows itFor international business Im sorry but its about on par maybe even worse than a general business degree. The classes are mostly about foreign exchange policy sometimes trade. International business is even worse to try and find a job in. The position that would be streamed like if you get an HR degree you look for an HR job acct degree gt Accounting job etc. from an international business degree nonexistent. I was an International Business major in my first year and after I learned this I immediately switched.... If none of these seem good to you may I suggest OPMA Operations Management. Its kind of statistic like z formula and bell curve but theres not a lot of numberscalculating and its mostly about analyzing those numbers from adding project management and efficiency. Like if a project is due at X date how many and which part of the process can be given slack time. You usually use charts to figure those out rather than formulas and I actually found it really fun and interesting. It was my second choice after Marketing. ,findapath,cg328w3,2,t5_2wqq6

I know people here have talked about trade schools but before you pay for an education apply for apprenticeships with companies and unions. Earn money to learn instead of paying tuition.

College has NOTHING to do with your raw intellectual power but instead how much hard work youre willing to put in. Some people will be naturally more gifted than others but someone who is gifted and doesnt put in the work wont get half as far as someone who is less intelligent and is willing to put in as much time as they need in order to get what they want. Ive been outclassed by lots of people where willing to work much harder than I was and their dedication yielded the results they wanted. If you want any field stop thinking that you just arent capable of doing it. If you want something bad enough you will be able to work hard enough at it that you get what you want.gtI have issues with the medicine industry and its ethics Broad generalization considering a lot of people going into medicine are completely innocent and generally have a genuine interest in helping others.gtAngry Atheist science students irritated me in the past. I know not all science students are like that though. I am a Christian who is open to all ideas but I dont condone religion bashing .It should be RARE that you find someone like that. However if you go for something pure like a biology major youre going to find out eventually that their ideas do not fit alongside religion. Other than that religion shouldnt even come up at any point.gt I lacked the confidence that I could be as good in social sciencescience as I was in the humanitiesThats entirely on you and goes back to what I was stating originally if you want to succeed buckle down and get the work done. Its honestly that simple go to class do your homework study enough to get the grade you want on tests and boom you have done it. People overthink it and youll come across obstacles but in the end that is what all of college boils down to.gt Im not sure about an MPH since Im struggling in basic stats right now I doubt Id pass anything more advanced.MPH can open up a lot of great job prospects. You have to be the one to decide if you want it enough to do the work required. Theres a reason less than  of people over  have a masters degree its not easy. However they wouldnt offer it if it wasnt obtainable. You just have to be willing to go the distance.gtNow Im also considering switching into History and Philosophy of Science which sounds perfect for me but Im skeptical about job prospects.Youre exactly right. Youll have a much harder time trying to find a job related to that. If that is truly your path then buckle down as do the work to find a job like that instead but know youll be putting yourself at a disadvantage for job prospects. Weigh what is most important to you when making your career decision.I dont mean to be harsh but I want you to seriously consider what is important to you and make a decision based on that. You likely have the potential to get into whatever field you want that youve listed but you ultimately have to be the one to do the work to make it happen.,findapath,cll5kvg,2,t5_2wqq6

How long do you still have?This may not be what you wanted to hear but it may just be best to keep doing what youre doing. Build a life and demonstrate that youre a solid member of the community. Once you are eligible if this is still what you want to do then I think your extra maturity and your life experience will give you a big leg up on some snot nosed  year old. For example a friend of mine worked as an electrician for years and had a few kids already when he decided to apply for the police at the age of  or so.

A lot of firms will pay for your training to get the license provided you work for them for a set amount of time after completing the training. Perhaps the solitude and independence of trucking would be good for you the dudes I know who work in that industry feel a lot of pride about what they do theres always going to be work in trucking until we invent Star Trek style transporters and youd be making mad decent money.Also look into trade unions.  You can say you dont have any brains but it sounds like youre selling yourself short.  Youll have to work around people that suck and plenty of people who dont but my experience in the union was that you can always tell someone to fuck off whose being an asshole it just goes with the culture.  And as to whether youre smart enough? You are.  When I went to my apprenticeship interview for the IBEW there was a test and then a question of what is the first step you would take to solve   x  . Anyone can solve that right?This may sound silly but I mean it seriously... You have a lot of experience dish washing is there any business you could think of that incorporates that experience?  There are always people out there doing crappy jobs who realize oh nobody wants to deal with this crappy mess and then boom!  years later their garbage disposal scrap business random thing a person with a clean job would never dream of is a profitable enterprise.Last but not least look into janitor maintenance work in terms of better pay. My brother worked at a military installation mopping and emptying trash and such.  He worked by himself with his headphones on.  Because it was federal employment this dude made  an hour.  I damn near wanted to quit my job and go be a janitor with him... I just didnt want to live back in my home state.Youre not happy being a dishwasher but what you do is not who you are.  Dont sell yourself short and tell yourself that youre doomed or dumb because of where you are now.  Maybe you dont want I dont feel capable about going to college.  Thats okay it really is.  Do you need to spend your nights writing papers about the French Revolution or the Marshall Plan?  No you dont its really not everyones cup of tea.That doesnt make you dumb its probably an indicator that youre smart in a different way that doesnt involve book smarts.  You seem to want to improve yourself and your circumstances which indicates an ability to be reflective.  Its hard to make decent money with and without a college degree and you wont find yourself in a more comfortable position overnight but youre definitely free to be something else if you want to be.One more thing as somebody who washed dishes wear the gloves!

Of course take a some journalism classes when you can but dont make it your major because you wont have much to set yourself apart from all other aspiring journalists.Without revealing too much about myself I followed the same plan Im suggesting to you I have a degree and a postgraduate degree both in fields other than journalism kept reporting in my free time throughout school and that got me the qualifications to find job offers.

Also systems theory can also engage the other topics that you mentioned you had an interest in such as technology design and especially creating planning and executing plans. Check out Donella Meadowss Thinking in Systems book if you think that might interest you.Other than that theres nothing wrong with getting a double major and doing each as a separate pursuit.

4343172,0,t3_3ar1vx,Well to start off anyone telling you that youve ruined your life at  has an incredibly narrow view of life. As for dealing drugs... yeah that may not be the bestsmartest move and as youve had the pleasure of discovering has inherent risks.  I personally have supplemented my income with weed and while it had the benefit of letting me smoke for free it was also nothing that I would have focused on as my only money maker. Its simply too risky in my mind.Youve written that you were in school both times for careers that were oriented more for indoor officetype jobs. I can tell you that while that type of option is good for many people Im a bit of a free spirit and have found cubicle farms and corporate environments to be extremely stifling. If youre similarly minded you have lots of options still open to you from food service which can be a very satisfying endeavor if youve the mindset to retail to farm hand to starving artist. If you want my opinion you are at the perfect age to be a free floating entity. Youve got damn near a decade before society really expects any of you and you made no mention of significant other or children so your list of responsibilities sort of begins and ends with you which is a blessing at your age. Maybe what you should be doing is having as many different types of experiences that you can. Being a rolling Stone is not inherently flaky. Setting up a bank account is a good first step and if you scrimp and save for a month or two you can get in a financial position that while it cant be compared to being rich is at least comfortable for a young single man. Also going from job to job isnt necessarily a bad thing and if you show up on time and do your work and then make sure that you give proper notice as you move from job to job its not going to look bad on you.Just my two cents there.

4875085,0,t3_3hna27,Hello there. Hi! Hello. AhemOk so you are already a federal worker so is a masters worth it? Umm yeah pretty much yeah. Ive been working for years to try and get my foot in the door with any federal program. I ended up taking the MPA program at American Public University. It is a bit more expensive than Champlain College but not by much.The difference between APU and CC is that the majority of my professors were at some point federal employees. The program there seems to be aimed at federal employees especially military and those needing a Masters in order to advance in their career. I cannot know for sure but I have heard that they have a decent reputation in the federal government.One thing to understand is that so long as your masters program is regionally accredited a degree from one university will have the same weight as another. Of course it isnt always true but for the kinds of degrees you and I are interested in that is the case. I guess the most important factors area Do you hope to stay in the federal government?b What kind of position do you hope to have in the future?c What is your budget? What is the maximum you are willing to invest in a masters degree? This is asked not to take away from CC but to ensure that the answers from a and b are doable with your financial restrictions.For myself as I said I have an MPA now and it can be done in a year if youd like but I took about  months. It is considered to be a  year program. It was really a hitormiss on the professors and the courses but that is what ratemyprofessor is for. I would say at under  an MA in just about any relevant subject for a federal positionemployee is well worth it.,findapath,cu91k4f,1,t5_2wqq6

5037031,0,t3_3jvspx,Let me give you some advice. See you come across as a people person. And thats really hard to do as a younger person these days. Most of us are stuck in our phones and heres you... Thinking about how to better yourself and make money. Money is important but you are learning the most valuable tool that quiet frankly as someone whos only a few years older then you are learned too. Ask people for advice and ask people how you can better yourself for a better financial future but think of these life guides youll meet in life as people that can show you the truest meaning of life and thats finding a job that youll be passionate about. So you want to consult. Awesome. Consult people on a large purchase by taking the worst possible experience for most people and making it simple fun exciting and knowledgeable. Sell Automobiles. Not just any automobiles either. Sell a brand that is reliable trust worthy and more importantly make sure the dealership you consult for has a reputable and proven track record for being humble and community focused. Since I was your age someone was kind enough to guide me and I thought... Me sell cars? Those guys are assholes but I paid attention built a business partnered with really honest and amazing people in my small time in this industry and became and still am one of the top sales people in the country. You wouldnt ever know it by looking at me but Im surprised Ive gotten where Ive gotten. It was all because I paid attention to the right people and aligned myself with a positive and honest company that provided the greatest learning platform and social settings to make a positive impact on my community and provide a trustworthy and down to earth experience. Ive met some amazing people that would blow your mind. And Im not taking about people that throw baseballs for a living or sing into a microphone. Im talking about parents single people going off to college and you watching them fall in love get married have a kid and growing with peoples lives and the trust and human bond and stories you get to share with clients.  My clients are my friends there my doctors my lawyers...oops was going to fast.... You become part of a community and you grow up and grow up with people you work with and its not a job anymore... And you make money and you save it.... But thats how you find your passion. So consult do something big be remembered Im consulting you to think about a career and be yourself and leave a small mark on society and make the things in life that are magical like working at a pet store turn into growing up with people in a different way that will make you smile and sometimes even make you cry. Best of luck I was  years old when I was given this advice I am giving to you. ,findapath,cut5jma,2,t5_2wqq6

5440743,0,t1_cw73llq,If you want to be an engineer the math is definitely important. You can barely design a basic circuit without at least a minimal understanding of integrals. If you are going to go for the upgrading definitely determine which post secondary you are going to go for and determine what the prerequisites are. Make sure your upgrading courses are directly relevant so you dont waste any resources. Usually if you get all the courses you would have needed for a B.Eng you can also get in to a diploma. So if the B. Eng admission doesnt follow through you can easily switch out if you want to. There seem to also be more colleges in the states that will upgrade diplomas in to degrees so you definitely can still make it to being an engineer if you have to take the diploma route. Service and building will definitely help you out in the long run but you do have a ways to go if you want to be able to design things legally.

Most importantly I would take it easy like no stress no pressure about it. Finding the right thing to do is hard because society puts pressure on us. Do what you love whether paid or not paid. You like animals? There are tons of organisation looking for volunteer in that field. Often as soon as a job becomes available in those organisation you have a big advantage as you have already experience with them. You like reading and english? What about writing?

6560999,0,t3_44t7ew,I cant speak to the entrepreneurship question nor to the requirements for a CIO.That being said the vagueness you see in ads has a reason for existing. A lot of employers in the field arent hiring you for your education. Once you have the base prerequisite knowledge a lot of companies hire the person alone. Jobs that involve a lot of coding involve a lot of teamwork and cooperation. Smashing an interview out of the ballpark gives you a better shot at the job than a background in maths and stats. At least where I am from nearly all individuals in the Csuite are the ones who started from the bottom and worked their ass off and had a little bit of luck. Best advice is to get a resume together and a really solid template for your cover letter and make your voice heard to all these companies that are hiring. The worst you can get is no response at all you stand next to no chance of being hired without making yourself known to the employer. A side note a LOT of companies hiring programmers are very newage employers looking for extremely personable young workers for the face of their company. Open door policies and fun work places are becoming much more common and these companies are the type that often take fresh graduates and train them and build their skill sets to tailor their needs. While I have almost no prior experience in the entrepreneurship field I do know a few individuals who have tons. If you provided me with some questions I could see if they have any advice for you. You are likely aware of this by now but forging your own path has a lot of risk and takes a lot of capital investment and you wont be making any money for yourself for a while.

That being said the housing market in Denver and Seattle is insane. Its always insane in LA so I wont hit on it. I am in no way saying dont move to Seattle just be prepared. People are making offers on housing that are sometimes k to k over asking. Houses stay on the market for hours sometimes. That being said I love this area I live in Olympia but were in Seattle often and I work in real estate so Im familiar with it on that level. Its usually temperate the people are nice theres plenty of culture good food the mountains are close the ocean is close. Its fantastic. People bash LA and I get it but if you dont want to be friends with shallow people dont go looking for shallow people. I lived there almost two years and I loved all the people I met. Mostly writers and actors too. None of them were shallow. Everyone had realistic expectations. We all worked hard for our goals. I left because of money not because of people. If you want to work in LA you should. I worked in El Segundo by all the aerospace companies and its unlike the rest of LA.

9581042,0,t3_5c2ykv,I felt similar to you at   now and dealt with Panic Disorder. There are a few things you can do I agree that maybe it is best to find a stress coping mechanism and deal with it now rather than letting stress permeate your life so much that being stressed out becomes part of you. Different people have had and are sensitive to different levels of trauma that make successful coping mechanisms a sort of wildcard. For me I have successfully coped by exercising fairly intensely regularly stepping away from my desk or situation thats stressing me out playing video games venting to a trustworthy friend or mentor etc. During the really hard times I will seek out therapy andor medication. Then I try to cut down or out on nonessential things in my life that make me feel stressed out ex. going low contact with dramatic people not getting hung up in guilt etc.Dont let stress become a regular characteristic of yourself. Think of it as a phase. Like the stretch leading up to the pinnacle of a roller coaster. Coping is a huge part of stress but there are ways to find low stress environments or fields where you can still pursue graphic design and other things you want to do. I have found that working in nonprofit andor govt positions are more low stress. When Ive worked at other places the demands and expectations are different. For me being able to come in and leave without expectations to stay late it important to staying low stress. There are still days where I travel for work and have to put in extra hours but  of the time Im in at am and out at pm.Dont give up what you want to pursue because of stress. Stress passes and learning to master stress builds character and is an advantageous skill.

If you want to opt for something easy again maybe do a certification in HR.

10100146,0,t3_5khg7n,Hey there!  Im definitely not the most experienced person who could be replying but I found myself in your shoes about two years ago.  Coming into college two years ago I had a small checklist for my life.  Its not entirely different than yours. I wanted to travel I wanted to do science I wanted to work outdoors particularly in remote and rugged locationsFor most of my life I wanted to be an archaeologist a travel writer or a wildlife biologist.  Enough people convinced me I was going to be a failure so I lost confidence.  Instead I opted for a geology major.  If you like science and the outdoors this could be right up your alley.  Most of my professors had been all over the world studying paleoclimatology evolution discovering minerals.  Theyve walked deserts climbed into volcanoes and flown bush planes.  There was rigorous calculus physics and chemistry involved with my studies but it was very rewarding.  My problem was that I really became disillusioned with science and academia as a career.  Got fed up and jumped ship.I wouldnt change those years for anything.  Learned a lot about myself.  Since then I discovered a passion for People Languages SustainabilityWhich led me to dabble in degrees such as Anthropology  Education Environmental studies environmental science Animal ecologyI settled on forestry and Global Resource Systems.  Forestry allowed to work with people land management ecology and economics all at once.  Global Resource Systems allows me to travel learn languages and help build sustainable development.  It might not be the path you want to choose but I the best I can do is share my mess of a thought process.Most students I have met in your shoes and my shoes generally lean toward wildlife biologyecology.  They like me romanticize the idea of cavorting around the countryside watching mountain goats and writing in a notebook.  The important thing to remember is that these dream jobs DO exist and you CAN achieve them though they are not all sunshine and rainbows.  But there is something more important you have to ask yourself How much is it worth to me?I will never forget what my professor a mammologist whom I highly respect said about our universitys animal ecology degreeThe average animal ecology graduate sells binoculars at Cabelas.  Thats what I tell students if you want to work for the FWS or go on these adventures you cant be average.  Average doesnt cut it.Everyone wants these jobs.  They are extremely competitive.  But thats ahead of the point.  Your are just trying to figure out what to study and I have vastly overextended myself in this reply.  I cant speak for your interests in virology and astronomy but youre already hitting the nail on the head with conservation ecology and env. sci.  Depends on what type of outdoor work you want to be doing.  Research seems to be the catchall for you so my advice is to seek out as many professors and graduate students as possible from as many different fields as possible.  Talk their ears off.  Theyll give you the absolute highs and the shittiest lows of their work.  Theyll also give you a realists response.  Which is very important as many people especially me tend to view everything with rose tinted glasses.,findapath,dbo29lg,10,t5_2wqq6

This can include classes on any subject imaginable including high ropes and backpacking called challenge or adventure education. Often you live on site  This is the majority of what I do so my answers will skew this way.Favorite I get paid to run around in the woods and get kids excited about the same things that Im excited about. For a living I do the same things that I would be doing on my days off. I hike anywhere from  miles a week for work. I live in a place people vacation to. Ive shown kids their first waterfall been followed by a pod of porpoises in a canoe had stuffed animals named after me seen the most scaredtodeathofeventheslightestdirt students literally and excitedly roll around in the dirt three days later because of me. You know the phrase a bad day fishing is better than a good day working? You know whats even better? Teaching people to fish at workWorst Draining. Its a physically and mentally draining job. Im an extrovert hardcore. But its my job to be always ready always calm always interested always problem solving always in control. If someone gets a splinter I have to deal with it. If someone breaks their ankle and falls off a mountain I have to deal with it. In many jobs in this field youre given a place to live as part of your reimbursement which means youre living working and playing with the same people every single day. That can be draining. Its often not a normal  job. Today youve got a program in the morning and evening but nothing in the middle tomorrow an early morning the next day a late night... If you dont have a good selfawareness and a good mental release it can burn you out hardcore. You can get the same question a dozen times a day every day and you have to answer it as if its a really good original question. There are a good number of people who burn out of this field and who just decide its not for them which most people wont tell you. Im being real with you. Oh... and its physically draining too. As I said before  miles a week. Ive done more than that too.Desk Time Honestly I dont have enough desk time. Teaching is the base of my job and most of what I was hired for. But I still have to do normal office stuff like managing a budget working on outreach materials facility maintenance staff meetings curriculum development various trainings and the inevitable hundred emails that are probably waiting for me when I get back to the office. During the busy season March to November Im often lucky to get an hour in the office every week. During the slower season Im usually working  hours in the office a week.Personality Extroverts often do well which I bet you expect but Im one of two people on staff that identify as extroverts so thats not key. Sociable. Its a very social job and living situation. That means you need to at least be comfortable with people not necessarily the center of attention. In fact if you feel you need to run the Me Show all the time youll probably have fun but be a really shitty educator who people wont necessarily like or hire Ive been there done that got the attitude adjustment Flexible. Hey boringboringboing Janice called in sick so we need you to do a seven hour class with a group of kids youve never met before. Oh and its a good chance of thunderstorms and gale force winds today. Oh and one kid is in a walking boot three have life threatening allergies two threw up last night and seventeen of them are homesick. Be ready for everything and ready to change plans at a moments notice. Good with kids. I dont care what organization you work for youll meet and interact with a lot of kids. The majority of organizations focus on  grade because their academic standards make the outdoors logical. Ive worked with inner city kids whove never been more than two miles away from home and curse more than theyd allow on TV and Ive worked with country kids who say well shit. Ive caught a bigger Rattlesnake than that with my bare hands! Then ive had others who talk straight up Valley Girl style and dont quite understand that trees dont produce Wifi. Sense of Humor. Life is funny. Kids are funny. Nature is funny. Coworkers are funny. Youve got to be able to laugh at things that are funny because good lord i could tell you a story... SelfAware. This job can burn you out in a way youve never conceived of. Find a way to work with that. I cook I brew I dance I write I camp I aimlessly wander the internet and I dont do a damn thing some days. Have a release valve even if that means going to bed at PM some days. Also good advice for the rest of life.Big paragraphy bit I cant separate into sections In this field you meet a lot of people who like to go backpacking for eleven days straight and eat nothing but quinoa and organic grass fed free range kale. That aint me. I like burgers I like beer I like a day on the town followed by a night on the town and a nice warm bed. You often wont live really close or within a large city but youll often be able to get to one rather easily. I mean I like looking at Deer gracefully grazing along a babbling brook mere feet from my campground but I also like having a cup of tea at a nice local used bookstore. You can have both. And you should. In this field your path will vary. People in my field have had degrees including Biology Natural Resources Interpretation Education Wildlife Management Linguistics English Literature Performing Arts Dance English Literature History and psychology. And those are just off hand. Honestly something education related or biology related would be the most helpful but experience is more important. My main task is teaching. I do not usually if ever affect the spread of information to higher levels or other organizations or scientists. My spread of information is grassroots. I considered doing research and an organization more like you describe but thats not what I decided. I get my accomplishment from getting people a new appreciation of the outdoorsnature and their place in it. To me the question was of importance Getting research out into the ether of research that many never hear about or giving a group of people a reason to be interested? Putting that spark into their psyche showing people that this whole outdoors things is pretty damn cool and worthwhile and should be saved. Its funny that Ive gotten into the emotional side of environmentalism because Ive always been more fact based. But here we are. If you want to change the world do you start with academia or everyone else? Ill get off my soapbox now. There is overlap everywhere. Ive taught every scientific thing you can think of in one context or another. Bio chem eco and ag are relatively common. But yes I do physics regularly. Plus geology anthropology mycology entomology dendrology and hell I had a talk about particle physics about a month ago. Damn kid knew more than me it was AWESOME.I think Ive covered all youve asked.And dont worry about keeping it brief these are big decisions youre making and its always better to slightly overask some random dude on the internet if he can help.And if I can say one more thing.Imagine the last time you did something new. Maybe it was rock climbing sky diving cooking or even a new relationship. Think about the deepseeded thrill you have. Not butterflies but a swarm of bees. A buzzing rumbling roaring sensation that fills your entire mind and body. it has that underlying sweetness that holy shit I dont know what this is but oh my god i cant believe how fucking awesome this is. Picture it. Feel it. Feel your heart rate increasing until you think its going to explode and then the release where you just feel right. That.Thats what I do for a living.I create that.What do you want to do?,findapath,dbuab2l,10,t5_2wqq6

10623996,0,t1_ddbim3w,Thank you for your insightful reply I agree with you on most things but I need to clarify a couple points I dont think I should quit right now youre  right if I cant make real money now I probably wont be able to do it even with a free week so Im also waiting to bring in some more recurring revenue from my website before doing anything. My job is not bad Ive been here for  years now so I dont think its adjustment its a great job but I just think I dont like having a boss and set hours my brain is not wired to work  to  and its probably also because my first way of making money was to work as freelancer  entrepreneur. Also I agree with you that it would be ludicrous to work in the music industry in a role like the ones you described cause yes Im not qualified I was  thinking of something more  low level but in contact with people and in a music environment example in a vinyl shop. The only problem of course is money so I need to find a good compromise. Im not leaving out the option to do some IT work part time but I need to figure it out properly ,findapath,ddbs8so,1,t5_2wqq6

10729284,0,t1_ddmab7f,It will give you a way more realistic representation of the job world than high school does even if it does change. According to high school everyone becomes a teacher a doctor an artist a lawyer a writer or a mathematician. In reality most people who set out to become a doctor or a lawyer dont make it. And its really hard to get employed with just art or just math skills. And teaching is one of the least profitable collegeeducated jobs out there in the U.S.Indeed will give you a very good idea about the professions that are dying and which are booming.

10950611,0,t1_de9fqma,Yes and no.  Whenever I decided on my gap year because I was depressed and couldnt decide on what I wanted my parents made me get a job. I have been very blessed my entire life and I never had to work up until that moment. My only priority was school.My first job offer was as a dining aide at a nursing home. Im not going to lie at first I thought I was above it. Not so much that I was above the work but I just didnt think I would stay there long and I wouldnt learn anything from it. WRONG. I fell in love with it. I love working old people and I love my coworkers. Im very naturally a loving and caring person and I never saw myself in that light until I started working. Im also a people person even though Im shy and sort of awkward. This job has given me great work ethic and made me realize that I want to go into healthcare.I got a second job as well...my dream job working as a beauty advisor at Ulta. I love makeup and skincare and Im the go to person for skincare advice in my friend group. I hated working at Ulta and I only lasted a month. It was shallow work and I really struggled with making friends and dealing with my coworkers. My manager was an idiot and the store was a train wreck. Ironically enough I only enjoyed helping elderly people. I was a pretty damn good salesman I sold stuff to the regional heads daughter on the grand opening like a boss but I CANNOT sell things that I dont believe in which was something we had to do there. The management is what really did me in though. Im a stickler for professionalism and that job had next to none of it and it caused me daily stress. However I never knew that about myself until I got that job.So with that story out of the way apply broadly. You could apply to things you think may be interesting and end up hating them or loving them. You could apply to job you think you wouldnt like and learn a lot about yourself. Whatever job you apply to be mindful of yourself and your likes and dislikes. Both jobs I worked are minimum wage and Ive realized that money fucking matters. I dont want to be poor and even though I thought Id try and hack it as a starving artist I sure as hell will not be now after seeing just how my paycheck gets me while not even paying bills. This is an okay realization. I felt like a sellout but in actuality Im just discovering truths about myself and what I find important in life. You never know what you can learn from getting a job but I promise you you will learn something about yourself. Even little things. I had no idea that bad management could stress me out as much as it did I left Ulta in tears many times and even when I quit  seconds later my  manager was telling people over the radio and whispering. I NEVER want to work in an environment that unprofessional ever again and I will work as hard as I must to make sure I can have as much control over my work environment as possible.Lastly working will make you realize your true feelings about school. I hated it while I was there and thought it was bullshit. Now I would crave to be back in school. I miss learning and honestly my parents giving me the opportunity to go to college is one of the biggest blessing that I have ever been afforded. Im  blessed. Working made me realize that. ,findapath,de9h7ql,3,t5_2wqq6

11041003,0,t3_5xkdgk,I was bad at math and have made a great career in software development. If you enjoy it do it. Dont let math get in the way.The funny thing is I found two things. Theoretical math was something I was good at. This is the kind of math you need in CS. The other kind of math was something that programming naturally made me better at as well.I dont mesmerize formulas well but I can do proofs. If you show me a proof the kinds of math I was bad at suddenly get easy because I know why those rules exist. I can reason through it on a test if needed.I didnt start out great at proofs either. I just had more of an aptitude. I got better with practice.Maybe youre like me.Either way. If you enjoy coding do it. The rest will come and if you have to suffer through a few bad math classes its worth it.I hope you find your niche. Its OK to be patient.
