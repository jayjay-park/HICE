2690719,0,t1_cn9pugr,i loved the beginning of the show were farmtruck just smoked the vette.  then he called his buddy for double or nothin.  the guy was like oooo i got a ferrarri  italia i should smoke these foos and win my friends money back and then he lost to something that was bigger and heavier that the ferrarri.  but yea i emailed tuff enuff on his facebook and msg him that i would race him in my xterra and im waiting for a response.  also i heard they prepped their side for  hours and then it started raining and oil plus water dont mix which makes no contact.  but i wish chief won but he had no time to text the small tire on his ride.  but its tina i dont give her no worries but who knows she might make it ,StreetOutlaws,cn9son1,2,t5_32yg4

8027573,0,t1_d4id5q9,If he car was equal to what it was that night on the same road in the same conditions then yes the current upgraded Dung Beetle would beat it. I have no clue what he has done to his car currently so anything I say would just be pure speculation. But if you want a tv response Ill drag his ass! haha,StreetOutlaws,d4idho9,3,t5_32yg4

9989903,0,t1_db6ycha,Yea when you see him in other videos hes pretty normal. I find the whole thing really fake and offputting. Farmtrucks forced laugh is getting to be so bad that its about to come full circle and be funny due to the terribleness lol..,StreetOutlaws,db9pn33,2,t5_32yg4

11161086,0,t1_dex1t8s,He was the only part of the show I ever really connected with. I know anything he pursues will be highly regarded by all of us gearheads that enjoy his nobullshit approach and talent.,StreetOutlaws,dex3icc,3,t5_32yg4
11346702,0,t1_dfi49p9,I think Ive got it figured out after doing some web sleuthing. From what I gather there was official rules that they both signed off on that came from Discovery  the production company that is what Richard followed and Ive linked above. Chief on the other hand seems to think that what he said in his original challenge video are the rules and thus thats why he was angry with Richard. I dont think Richard was being a dick per se. He was following the rules printed out and handed to him so he was blindsided  flabbergasted by what Chief was talking about. He wasnt wrong in what he was saying but Chief was doing a terrible job of communicating his point. For example in his challenge video he didnt say you have to be behind the wheel he said get fitted for a fire suit so in his mind he directly said rules are you have to be the driver. but he didnt actually say that directly thus the confusion is coming from Chiefs own mind. With all of that said Im glad the underdog won or the little money won. Im not for or against anyone. Im just watch to see cars being built. ,StreetOutlaws,dfi4msr,8,t5_32yg4
