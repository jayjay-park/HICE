259117,0,t1_cf7ls82,Oh now thats a real question. I wasnt thinking Id be able to make requests so I was just wondering if they were making binaries for any of my distros for launch.But to answer your question I would like to be able to run the miner on CentOS . and Debian  Wheezy.I would not mind having to build it myself although I would very much prefer precompiled binaries.

271342,0,t1_cf8vqrg,Oh but it gets better! Theyve just figured out how to use cudiminer hahaha... These guys with GPU racks are now pulling out mhs hahahaThis whole coin is a flop. Its over and dead. I dont care if this dev learns his lesson or not I just dont want him ever back in this community. He had something that could have been big but was unbelievably incompetent. Like you have to intentionally try to screw this up. Its crazy how poorly done this was. ,maxcoinproject,cf8vvds,1,t5_300bq

271730,0,t1_cf8wc69,STILL not working. Ive now got the maxcoin.conf file in the Maxcoin folder in LibraryApplication Support AND Ive added all those extra add node things suggested earlier. But when I open the wallet app it still says No Block Source available. Is there something else I should be doing to set it up. Ive tried putting all the pool settings in but that doesnt help and if I try solo mining all the boxes are locked and wont let me enter anything. Im sure I must be CLOSE now but still no cigar.,maxcoinproject,cf8xbkk,1,t5_300bq
272896,0,t3_1x84pi,Run the command maxcoind getbalance.If you do indeed have anything to send you can usesendtoaddress the address to send to amount of MAX to sendIt will return the transaction ID if it went through.Good luck!,maxcoinproject,cf91oy1,1,t5_300bq
274696,0,t1_cf97hpn,When that paragraph was written it was true... GPU mining did not exist for their Keccak implementation. However within a few hours today of the source being realized some smart individuals were able to implement it.  Its not so much that its a scam... the maxcoin developers are just very inexperienced and inept.,maxcoinproject,cf98gj3,1,t5_300bq

299301,0,t3_1wzmme,Actually weve called off hosting a maxcoin pool. The information wasnt available in time nor accurate when we did get info. There is no longevity in this coin in our opinion and many of the promises made by the authors were broken on the release date. Putting the release off another month would have been better. Anyway yeah were moving on and so should you. Thank you for those who tried out our services.,maxcoinproject,cfbse57,1,t5_300bq
