The whole reason for this is so that the older stabler ecosystem supporting forrest doesnt need to be touched sadly this isnt always true depending on demand and planting rate but its better than nothing.Alot of progress has been made in forestry that means some countries are planting more than they are cutting and that the health of forests can be improved with careful management.But evil corporation is obviously evil because.,nature,cympk44,11,t5_2qh4c

9379939,0,t1_d94xosj,Warren Buffett a pretty smart guy said about  years ago that population control was the single solution to most of the worlds problems. If I remember his intention was to leave nearly all his wealth toward that one issue and therefore have the greatest impact on the world. Then he met Bill Gates who Buffett says is smarter than himat least in regards to philanthropy. Buffett is handing over nearly all his wealth to Gates which Im guessing will be close around  billion dollars. Gates from what I read has the complete exact opposite view on population control. He basically believes the more people the merrier. I read that he thinks the more people on earth the greater the chance that one of those people will find a solution to a given problem on earth. I think his example was along the lines of saving a little girl in Africa  today from dying of malaria and she grows up to solve some fantastic problem that otherwise would have never been solved.A third smart guy Elon Musk basically is over it all and thinks earth is screwed. His solution is to colonize other planets. Not a single  tiger so far has signed up to make the trip to his first outpost on mars.On the other hand this guy is always ready to go,nature,d94z2si,2,t5_2qh4c
