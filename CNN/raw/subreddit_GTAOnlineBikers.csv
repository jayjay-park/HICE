9183077,0,t3_55zfn5,The Gas Station Smack Dab in the middle of the map is arguably the best.  Why?  The central location makes it so that Club work isnt ever at extreme distances.  If you own a Club in the City it tends to send you to the stix.  If you own a Paleto Club it tends to send you to the city.It also helps that its cheap.,GTAOnlineBikers,d8g0tk1,2,t5_3g0cp

9440987,0,t3_59zumx,A Harley Fatbob with some Ape Hangers would get you pretty damn close. Of course all the fancy modifications in LSC will be expensive but possible to pull off IRL.      Analizing the Zombie Chopper The headlights and front clip are based off the Fat Bob but the frame looks closer to a Harley Softail design. The wheels in game are quite a bit fatter than anything youll find IRL unless you want to venture into the Very Custom realm. Again doable but expensive. Apes look like theyre about a  rise. ,GTAOnlineBikers,d9cpmvc,8,t5_3g0cp
