3968755,0,t3_33enxr,I was on isogenix for six weeks and it made me ill. When I did the cleanse it brought me out in cold sweats and severe stomach cramps  that kept me awake for two days with the pain.  I was told not to take any painkillers as it would be putting toxins into my body and it was all the toxins leaving my body that was causing me the pain. It was horrendous.Its overpriced milk powder with a few synthetic vitamins and heaps of crappy ingredients.  The cleanse for life contains Aloe vera which is a very strong natural laxative.  This cant be good for anyone!Of course people loose weight by cutting their calories. I signed up to it for emotional benefits not to lose weight and I didnt get any at all ,Isagenix,cr8o6z9,1,t5_2wzz9
