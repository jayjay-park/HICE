764963,0,t1_cgr0did,I agree with both your points which is why I would say it shouldnt be an enforced rule but maybe an added note to submission rule A. Something like thisgt Explain why you hold your view not just what that view is. This includes stating flaws you see with it if applicable.But Im not very good with words so someone else could probably rephrase that to make it more clear.,ideasforcmv,cgr8cuc,3,t5_3061g
765970,0,t3_22w9nm,I dont think that you require a seed of doubt for a good CMV. Say Im a racist and Ive evaluated the evidence and that racism is the logical viewpoint. Our society does not consider racism an acceptable viewpoint so I want my view to be changed. So even though I think that my view is logical I can create a CMV in case there are good arguments against my position I have not encountered. I do not doubt my position I just want it to change,ideasforcmv,cgrcgyc,1,t5_3061g
772421,0,t3_22zves,Perhaps you could reply to our sub founders request for exactly this feature hereAccording to the only reply so far the only way for CSS to replace !delta or delta in your case with a delta symbol is if the user makes it a hyperlink.,ideasforcmv,cgs2ue4,1,t5_3061g
808767,0,t1_cgvrki3,I have some questions.A view is changed. A delta is typed. A bot notifies the mod. The mod verifies and grants delta award. Is this how it works?If so I think I have a really easy solution to help sort you solved from unsolved posts. All posts would automatically get flair. When the mod grants delta the mod would also change the flair or post. Everyone would easily see that the view was changed. This would only need two flairs could be implemented easily fast. Would not solve all your issues.,ideasforcmv,cgw7m83,1,t5_3061g
809035,0,t1_cgw7m83,gt A view is changed. A delta is typed. A bot notifies the mod. The mod verifies and grants delta award. Is this how it works?No uDeltaBot has a subset of moderator permissions sufficient that it can edit the users flair itself. It does so directly.Having it go through the mods as a manual process would be very laborious and you can get an idea of just how much by clicking on uDeltaBot and seeing how much it does in a day.,ideasforcmv,cgw8prg,1,t5_3061g
1025600,0,t3_25g6on,This is actually a pretty good idea but not as a replacement. I think that the Internet is easily big enough to have multiple change my view websites. If you wrote a separate webapp that was much more friendly then I suspect that youd be able to get a much more mainstream audience. I suspect though that many people would still prefer to use the subReddit.,ideasforcmv,chkv86b,1,t5_3061g

2339097,0,t1_cm0r5cz,I debated posting this on CVM before I posted here but I thought it would sound a little too soapboxy. If this was on CMV though I would give you a delta.I do think the rule could be implemented a little better though. If you only remove the posts that dont provide a new argument that enforces the parent comments I think it would allow for more discussion and a more backandforth discussion between those who support or oppose the view while still preventing bandwagon posting that doesnt add new arguments to the discussion. Each thread could become a debate area where multiple people are changing their views to both sides.,ideasforcmv,cm0tpkm,1,t5_3061g

3345003,0,t3_2yhh48,A few questions...There are  mods.  If  suck why does that mean that there should be a complete overhaul?In the case of uiamaNbie why is their involvement with other subs relevant?  Can you provide examples of them not allowing ANY dissenting opinions on CMV?Similarly do you have any examples of ucwenham removing submissions that they dont agree with?In the case of uGrunt you dont even say why you find them suspicious.Its great to make allegations but its hard to discuss them productively without any sort of evidence.,ideasforcmv,cp9jzv5,5,t5_3061g

4011597,0,t1_crdih37,I think it can be done. I think a good way to approach bias is to have a separate page for both sides of the argument. That way both sides can address the perceived counterarguments from their point of view.,ideasforcmv,crdjx26,2,t5_3061g
4362328,0,t1_cshcu8p,You could do it manually pretty easily.Step  make an announcement of this policy.Step  For all the topics on the frequent posted list search the keyword in the reddit search. So keyword feminis for feministsfeminism or black for racism and then once there are  posts on about the same subject posts of that kind will no longer be allowed. Im not talking about the type of post that adds a variant to an old debate. For example on gay people there was a post saying that if a gay gene was discovered it should be removed from the gene pool. Thats different than the classic I dont support gay rights or I dont like gay people. The generic cookie cutter debates are the ones that would no longer be allowed.Alternatively this policy could be rebranded as a new argument type of thing where viewers can request a posts deletion if it adds no new arguments to the discussion based on past CMVs. ,ideasforcmv,cshda48,1,t5_3061g
