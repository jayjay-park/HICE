Geisha isnt good in pvp cuz her heal is reliant for it to be up. By the time its up the rest of your team might be dead. Dont you have any other alternatives for your rear? all  of them arent really that good for PvP. For PvE tho all girls are workable.Did you mean Lily not Lucy? Anyway nd team would be RosieGamblerCynthiaLilyWildgirl. I dont have a Celeste so I cant comment on her but no one uses her in my PvP at my rank.As for which is better I guess if I were to choose I think the st team is better. Rosie to tank and amplify your physical damage dealing girls Boxer as a secondary tank and your mid and rear girls as DPS.,GirlsXBattle,d2tjvoa,1,t5_3dcsv

Lily is your goto for champion pairs very well with Elvis and Wildtress eventually. Joan is niche useful and very helpful in late chapter...  I want so say where is a Guan Yin Boss so is Tennese she can delay her spin and let you get your team going to stun her out.  After that a Joan ult can help you lock out the fight. Scythe is niche useful for a number of things as well worth keeping near your top levels.

9412231,0,t3_59f1rc,Below is the post from the OP of the PSA on Scratch eventHey guys so with the release of the silvia recharge I recharged enough to get her  stars so I figured id do the scratch event for caitlin. Well it seems that the cards shuffling will always result in the same arrangement once revealed i.e caitlin will always be in the same spot this has been the case for  of my cards so far. However the card must match exactly this makes resetting predictable and controllable. If anyone sees otherwise please let me know but ive ended up with  caitlin pieces everytime so far.Edit this seems to only be the case when i reveal in a certain pattern always ending in x  caitlin. For those curiouse on the card with caitlin and x caitlin. I revealed with top left cornertop right cornerbottom left cornerbottom right cornerbottom middle leftbottom middle right after this top middle left with be the x card and top middle right will be x caitlin. The other cards are always revealed in order as wellEdit I now have a  star caitlin it took me  coins i skip every other card except for the first drawI have a few questions. Is there a way to determine which card is for pet pet gear BG BG gear etc?In the PSA thread the OP posted a link to pic of a card  that card shows several BGs and a X multiplier does that mean that he got scrolls for each BG a minimum of  for each BG and  for each BG with a  in the lower corner?If so if Im understanding this correctly he got  scrolls for Cait on that card.I really want to get Cait but want to improve my efforts to get her so I really want to focus on scratch cards for BGs mainly.  ,GirlsXBattle,d992e3a,1,t5_3dcsv

Two of them never showed Cait even after  refreshes. One of them kept showing pet gear and food. The other one kept showing pet essences. Only the last one showed Cait AND it showed Cait every other redraw and never showed the pet stuff  eight out of  refreshes had the x Cait with the x multiplier.

9474422,0,t3_5ahm66,I felt Bamboozled with the whole Cait recharge for  diamonds deal.I started the Halloween event with K diamonds dropped down to ish and then recharged back up to K.Playing the patience game seems like a good idea. For the same K diamond recharge I could have gotten Cait and Samurai but I had to jump on getting Samurai the first day which cost me.The scratch cards is what really did me in. So many diamonds were bleed from my total trying the next card to get the Cait scratch cards but I took the free scratch on each card.In the grand scheme of things I got Cait and  scrolls so with the  scroll I got from the recharge I got her to  stars. Im on a fairly new server and Ive been checking the top  on TF and I dont see many Cait at  stars and none so far at  stars so that may give me a slight advantage. I also got enough stam food to go from level  to . Enough Nurse scrolls to accelerate her to  stars significant amount of scrolls to accelerate Drac to  stars and enough to evolve Lisa if I wanted too. I got seven essence for the pet and between   K gold. Not to mention about  t  lucky coins.I felt the whole experience got worse on Saturday when then changed the scratch cards taking off Nurse and Drac and replacing them with Hanzo. I wanted to pick up Hanzo but by that time I was gun shy of scratch cards. If I recall correctly on Saturday I just took the free scratch and the first scratch which I used my free lucky coin on and that was it.Sunday is when I learned about Hanzo. On Sunday I decided that I would only switch cards based on the amount of  diamonds I got from work place which was  total.On the seconds card I uncovered a x multiplier and then using my free coin I got  lucky coins giving me a total of  lucky coins.The third card was had Hanzo as I recall two Hanzo Cait Lisa and a Lisa with x multiplier.I using the scratching the left half of the card I was able to  of the  boxes scratched leaving me  coins. After much debate I decided on purchasing  lucky coins which would allow me to complete the left half of the card and have enough lucky coins to go the  lucky coin scratch. Speculating that based on the   pattern for my final scratch I choose the th box. Having already uncovered Cait. but wanting Hanzo I was wishywashy about uncovering the x multiplier because it would cost me more diamonds to buy more lucky coins. The th box was Lisa and that ended my first scratch event.From the final recharge that I did I got enough scrolls to evolve Samurai to  start and enough essences to summon Casper and another  essence. I dont remember if that is enough to get Casper to  stars or not.In conclusion the next scratch card event will have to be extremely good and I will wait at least  if not  days before trying my luck if at all.I dont know if Carolgames overlaps recharge events but I think I will wait at least a day before recharging to get a BG.,GirlsXBattle,d9gxdqz,1,t5_3dcsv

10937305,0,t3_5w79of,So you know how there is usually more than one campaign mission to raid to get certain items? what you should do is pick a mission to raid that also gives other items you need. this is just an example this doesnt really exist but say you have to choice between two missions which are likely to drop the following items  campaign mission can give you shield maker riot shield and pad OR another campaign mission gives you the shield maker socks toy hammer and sisters boots. you would be better of raiding that first hypothetical mission because there are other valuable items to get while farming for shield maker. ,GirlsXBattle,de83u9x,1,t5_3dcsv

11178627,0,t1_dez30fc,gt  Mainly I wanna know about her instant kill of opposite attributes. I dont get that at all.whats not to get? if a girl doesnt match the attribute of the target girl they get executed so make a team with same attributes. ,GirlsXBattle,dez32d6,1,t5_3dcsv
11205221,0,t1_df22wd2,Thank you! Just did yours as well twice from my game and main fb ,GirlsXBattle,df23ivk,1,t5_3dcsv
11212043,0,t1_df2b18l,Well i did say use wildtress when i suggested the compit might take a few times for  due to WT failing to survive but with Nagia who deals dmgboost hotties dmg and ccs cupid with her freeze skillits easy clearing cupid.Regarding Elviss shield its not on front girl exclusivelyher shield actually shields the bg that is at the foremost of your lineup. Like when Jav flashes to the rearAlice blinking to the front. When Luna ultsshe teleports herself to the foremost becoming the main tank which is why Elviss shield will drop on her.,GirlsXBattle,df2ver3,1,t5_3dcsv
11216190,0,t1_df3bnym,Btw Im not really ahead of you actually I just hit  and I did p and fully skilled the fencer that I just got from the event so my opinion on her is exactly for this point of the game. I had only one chance to try her at TF while being on def and I won that single match but developments came and I jumped on a completely new team.  Anyway if you have a Caitlyn and the meta there doesnt include too many backline jumpers she could be ok really. My TF position is high so my team options are most strict,GirlsXBattle,df3cb23,1,t5_3dcsv
11282294,0,t3_60ynf8,Well I dont think SuccubaLeona are any good before awakening you might want to replace one of them with Schyte. She can work well in your third team  Lily attacks everyone and reduces their HP to half and then Schyte finishes them off.,GirlsXBattle,dfatxt2,1,t5_3dcsv

11710705,0,t3_672ept,Id go for Wildtress first. Tanks are a lot more important and Champion coins are plenty. By late game everyone from that store is easily at  unless you opt for gear instead. For TF eventually? Sisha over Wildtress. Though my goto tank is far and away AWK Leona for everything outside of Champion where WT still takes the cake. Sisha somewhat needs Nurses support to be fully effective.,GirlsXBattle,dgnfs2h,2,t5_3dcsv
