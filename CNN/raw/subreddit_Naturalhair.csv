2324651,0,t3_2lmdzm,Im a distance runner and triathlete. When Im doing dry sportspuff on top of my head. I dont sweat a lot in my scalp so usually a spritz of some water then some sprayon leavein will refresh my hair. I wash it once a week.When Im training for something that I have to swim I coat my hair with Pink conditioner before putting on my latex swim cap. My hair usually gets wet anyway after an hour swim but the conditioner protects it. Then I immediately cowash condition heavily and then put in styling products. Triathlon season is really expensive when it comes to going through hair products!,Naturalhair,clz1h44,2,t5_2t03a

If you like I could give you links to websites that recommend certain kind of foods that are beneficial for strong and healthy hair.The satin cap and scarf as protection is very good.One thing though I would recommend you to moisturize more often. The funny thing is I just send someone else the video but it is really good and was my starting point to a better moisturzing routine as wellI hope you find it useful. ,Naturalhair,codnrrk,1,t5_2t03a
3566278,0,t3_30jw9g,Just finished the survey and I believe it is a great one to do! Is it okay if I post your link in the hair care forums I participate in for more participants? Good work!,Naturalhair,cpys62z,1,t5_2t03a
3682466,0,t1_cpjlqg5,Same it helps me to know someones porosity level when looking for new products. I dont buy recommendations unless they have the same porosity as me.,Naturalhair,cqc0xf2,2,t5_2t03a
3995137,0,t1_crbkgfb,That sounds like a really great school and the perfect place to learn! I had no idea. ,Naturalhair,crbogcn,2,t5_2t03a
3995777,0,t1_crbqlzn,nope. That will just mess up your hair cuticles and cause them to lift assuming youre black. Black people shouldnt brush their hair but if you are a different race maybe your hair is smooth and fine enough.,Naturalhair,crbr2p5,1,t5_2t03a
4132050,0,t3_37ybur,My hairdresser has been certified in both the Ouidad and Deva cutting techniques and she sort of does a mix of them when doing my hair. I really like the end result which is why I happily pay  for my haircut. My hair looks round and full instead of being all weird and trianglelike it grows out so well that I often go a year between haircuts and it looks great both as defined curls or a frizzy afro. ,Naturalhair,crra04r,2,t5_2t03a
4143837,0,t3_37ybur,Yes! Ive been getting a devacut for about a year now. I love the shape my hair is short now and the fact that I dont have a poodle mushroom triangle fro and the shape holds up wash after wash. It also grows out well.,Naturalhair,crsm52e,2,t5_2t03a
4226318,0,t3_39bftj,I think the most enraging for me is when people imply its dirty since our hair has to be washed less often.  I got used to stares probing questions about upkeep asking to touch etc. and often not turned off by these if theyre done politely but Ill rarely let random people touch my hair.  I roll my eyes when nonblack people say they want the same style.  Like OK.,Naturalhair,cs1z70g,7,t5_2t03a
4226981,0,t3_39blyc,Oh gosh the ones I wear are mostly a satin blend or chiffon. The few others I have are probably a combination of cotton and polyester. I would have probably been one of the people that gave you an approvingadmiring look for wearing silk though. I am a bit cheap when it comes to the head scarfs I wear outside of bed.  ,Naturalhair,cs21w7s,1,t5_2t03a

4513712,0,t3_3ctiap,Conditioner loves you so you gotta love it back. Leave in is great but I condition after I shampoo and often once or twice during the week because the shampoo just takes so much even the good kinds. I love the Shea length retention shampoo and conditioner. When my hair was a little awkward I loved a quick scarf updo after a wash n go once dry of course. Play around with scarvesa brightly printed updo with a little pop of curls is the perfect summer hairstyle for my lazy natural self ,Naturalhair,cszllob,3,t5_2t03a
4534442,0,t1_ct26no1,Yes I agree about the edges! I think I lost some with this latest install. I think my edges fare much better when I leave my perimeter out. ,Naturalhair,ct276kq,2,t5_2t03a
4563637,0,t1_ct5uz9i,Why thank you  Days like that come far and few between. I definitely tried. Haha,Naturalhair,ct5v171,2,t5_2t03a
4566663,0,t1_ct68566,Interesting its in the lower back of my head and I sleep on my side so thats probably why. I cant really say whats wrong with the front of my hair its been this way for years it looks dry and brittle. Ive chopped all my hair off like  times because I go crazy every now and then and cant deal with having a huge afro but its always the same. I dont really do much to my hair besides washing it combing it. Im lucky its not doing any worse. I think only other people with hair like us really understands the struggle I mean just washing and combing my hair is like a workout lol,Naturalhair,ct68pnx,1,t5_2t03a
4650684,0,t1_ctgqy6a,I have two strand twists so I never have an issue. It would be time consuming  but maybe try twisting it before your work out.,Naturalhair,ctgs3so,2,t5_2t03a

7960654,0,t1_d49s7q8,I dont even use bands to tie the ends. My hair tapers toward the end and the texture causes the hair to sort of lock and stay together without unraveling. I only have trouble with the braidtwist coming undone if Im trying to braid with too much hair.I like it so far. I only use the shampoo and deep conditioner. It leaves my hair clean but still soft.,Naturalhair,d4aupi2,1,t5_2t03a

8359468,0,t3_4tjlq3,I didnt really care for it. Nopoo really didnt clean well and the conditioner was okay. It might have been the products I was using at the time they didnt make the nopoo clean well. Right now I use so very little hair products I could probably get away with it. ,Naturalhair,d5mhhtt,1,t5_2t03a
8458248,0,t1_d5y8b8m,This . When Im too lazy to braid tho Ill drape a t shirt over my head while my hair hangs down my back then use the length of the t shirt to gather the length of my hair pull it a little taut then twist the tshirt around my hair like you would if you flipped your hair to wrap a towel on top. Then Ill make a bun of the twist secure it with a hair tie and go about my day till Im ready to style it. Then its pretty stretched and about  dry my hair holds water like a mofo.,Naturalhair,d5ytdgq,3,t5_2t03a

10056554,0,t3_5jop1g,I dont know what that is but I would suggest seeing the person who styled your hair or a dermatologist. Ive had my hair bleached many times and it sounds like you may have gotten a burn or something.,Naturalhair,dbie699,1,t5_2t03a
10738491,0,t1_ddnb3yx,Thank you so much for these tips much needed! I just have one question do you have to twist your hair every night or can you just throw on a bonnet some nights? Seems like a lot of work twisting every night lol  ,Naturalhair,ddnlemo,1,t5_2t03a
