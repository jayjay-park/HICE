11422,0,t3_1tocun,Some of my uses might not come as mindblowingly creative to power users but here I go. I have to credit Jamie Todd Rubins Going Paperless series for almost half of these QR tag everything I took pictures of my house and annotated the dimensions with Skitch. If I ever go to a furniture store I dont need to go back home to know if something would fit. Also take pictures of the ID tag of appliances and vehicles. Now its easy to find model serial number or specifications. I have a digital filing cabinet share with my wife with personal information joint membership cards emergency information mortgage... I saved pictures of my bookcases. I can use ENs OCR to find a book. Scan or forward everything Christmas cards car repair bills confirmation emails software activation codes packing slips for packages I ship... Digital scrapbook from emagazines and ebooks. iPad screen capture FTW! Created a template in KustomNote to generate Work Orders to repair equipment at work. I then add comments and pictures as I complete the repair for reporting and future reference. My brother moved to the US five years after I did. I shared with a notebook with some useful information I had to learn from others mainly how bureaucracy works. A note with your and your familys medical history will come in handy next time you visit a new doctor. Keep a note with all my body measurements and clothing sizes. Now I dont need a tape measure every time I order something online. Plan trips and share the note with the itinerary. I have a note I send to whoever comes to pet sit while Im away. That way I dont have to explain where everything is every single time. It also has contact and emergency information the password to my wifi and instructions for the entertainment center. At meetings write down minutes and audio record it and take a picture of the whiteboard. Save style guides from rmalefashionadvice GIFs... Save submissions like this one in case someone asks how I use Evernote.,Evernote,cefqgyz,10,t5_2s9r5

941807,0,t3_24v3qt,I recommend both fewer notebooks and fewer tags PThe search function is awesome so dont use too much time organising. Organising notes takes effort. This works for a while but if at some point your unorganized notes heaps up and the effort to sort things becomes too great your system has failed. Having a reeeally simple structure e.g. Inbox  for unsortednew notes Archive  for notes you want to keep Todo  for notes involving actions you want to performworks most of the time and requires little effort. Skim through your inbox for todos reminders are great too if you use it on android at least add the rest to the archive. Try to keep the inbox empty. Use extra notebooks and tags where you feel the need. I sometimes have temporary notebooks when working on something specific for a period of time.Personally I use evernote for GTD.

3845003,0,t1_cquhkn8,Currently there are not any reviews  were working on itSaferoom doesnt check if notebook is local or synced. The only thing that matters is notebook name. For safety purposes all notebooks should be local.A quirk of Saferoom at the moment is that it doesnt correctly update at least from v.. to .. without fully uninstalling the previous version.  Also uninstalling the application will not remove the locally created notebooks or tags defined by the user used for encryption locally.  To remove a previously generated encrypted key one must do the following Go to cusersltusernamegtAppDataLocalSecom And delete the folder inside It is a hidden folder Then restart the applicationGo to cusersltusernamegtAppDataLocalSecomAlso note that Saferoom only supports a maximum password length of  characters.

This does not require a PlusPremium account.Ninja edit As for the immunization question you can tag each note that contains that information and searching will pull those up or even have the word immunization somewhere in the text of the note.

It can be parsed into just about other appropriate file format that you want. The API also allows you great flexibility for extracting any subset of the data that youd want.

8630075,0,t3_4y0x8x,After  years using Evernote with over k Notes organized using Notebooks and never trying to use Tags previously I reached a tipping point where Notebooks no longer worked for my needs. Too many Notes in too many nooks and crannies. Too much filing. The one to one relationship of Note in Notebook was also constraining and created cognitive dissonance when trying to decide where to file things.I decided to switch to Tags with only a few Notebooks based on research of information from several of the leading Evernote gurus out in the public space.For what its worth heres what is working for me. It has DRAMATICALLY improved my ability to find things using Search and more importantly it provides a simple framework for methodically labeling tagging important information so I dont spend a lot of time filing I hate filing  such a waste of timeI use this Notebook structureInBox collection point for all inbound content to be taggedSTACK gtgt My Collection   tmp scratchpad for temporary notes   Cabinet main warehouse   ReferenceSTACK gtgt Shared from othersSTACK gtgt Shared to othersThese are now my only Notebooks. Inbox is where all inbound stuff is sent temporarily  try to maintain inbox zero  before being tagged and sent mostly to Cabinet. Research is for things like Warranties User Guides Product Specs Manuals etc.My Tagging structure is still being tweaked but Im attempting to be very rigid in my application so I made rules for myself that I can always refer to. TAGGING RULESEvery important Note has at least one Tag.Not every note is important. You do not need to tag every bit of ephemera.Most Notes are probably important and worth the time to tag so that finding search them is easier.Using multiple Tags per Note provides functionality that cannot be reproduced with Notebooks.Manytoone Tagging enables very complex search options.Tags are plural when singularplural is in question. books not book.Tags hierarchy is lower case with a period . preceding the name. Hierarchy tags are camelCase when comprised of two words..hierarchy.hierarchyCamelCaseTags should contain no spaces. e.g. MultipleWordsTags include parent hierarchy separated by a period . and words are Capitalized and separated by a hyphen when comprised of multiple words in the form of hierarchy.GeneralSpecific  e.g. legal.AdoptionBabyCreate tags forGeneral Subject  e.g. .foodSpecific Subject  e.g. ingredients.EggsSource  inbound Notes created from noncore applications. e.g. source.IFTTT source.WebClipperChrome source.Expensify etc.People  people.DianePlaces  where.Paris Tags are organized by Nesting them.

10036307,0,t1_dbew1tl,Garoththorp the size of your notebook encrypted or not doesnt matter. You dont have to download or sync the entire GB notebook section. Just take out your iphone open the notebook browse to the appropriate password protected section and simply unlock it.So far like any modern mobile app in laymans terms the device is simply displaying the table of contents. Please allow me to try explaining this another way.Stop whatever youre doing right now and visit cnn.com. See all those various articles? Do you think your browser first had to download all the data from the dozens of articles on that cnn.com website youre seeing? Or do you think as is actual reality its just listing the titles of articles and if you click on the titles links it then and only then requests that specific web page and soon brings just that specific web page to you?In case youre wondering its the second part. Its why you can browse Netflix movies to stream and it only starts streaming the one movie you want. Its not going to try downloading petabytes of all Netflix movies just to bring up the streaming catalog. It doesnt take a  TB download to display all the movies that are available for you to watch. All it is doing is displaying a list of options for you to click on. Then it only downloads whatever option content you clicked on.Well same thing with any modern mobile app. Whether thats Evernote OneNote Apples Photos app etc.When you tell the OneNote app to open a notebook all it does is provide the names and organization of the sections within that notebook. Nothing more than the bare minimum such as titles and thumbnails show up. That only takes a very small fraction of data to download rather than all the data in that notebook.From there it only downloads what specific pages you click on. Its not going to bother trying to download the entire  GB notebook that specific page belongs to.Which is why when you click on a note it may pause for a second or more saying loading page. Thats what its doing. Downloading enough of that page for you to viewaccess it. Nothing else.So even with notebook sections thats not encrypted the app never has to download GBs of data just for you to browse contents. Youre only clicking on specific pages one at a time. Please understand this.Now for password protected notebook sections aka encrypted all it does is avoid displaying that table of contents  other than the name of that section. Thats why you cant search it. Those contents are not made available to your devices global search.However once unlocked that tells the mobile app that the contents of that once protected section can now be displayed and available for search. But again it doesnt have to actually download all the contents of that notebook section. It just makes the list representing that data its table of contents available to you and to search. From there it only has to download whatever specific pages you click on.Just the table of contents  in laymans terms. Your mobile device just needs to display the list of stuff you may request. Not actually download every single one of those things first which could take forever on a mobile device just to provide you with a list of those files.Does it make more sense now?,Evernote,dbfr9t0,1,t5_2s9r5
