It of course has the same woes as any other RP group drama drama egos and drama but its a big enough game that theres LOTS of different subcommunities to fit your style of play and RP. It ranges from the silly supercausal to the hardcore continuity RP that spans both ingame actions and forums. They just released the expansion so I think you might be able to get the core game for free which will at least get you into the world and various RP guilds!,Roleplay,cwdki9i,3,t5_2qrxs

9689278,0,t3_5dsed1,Theres a lot of things going on here despite the brief explanation. But you should never feel bad about staying true to character. The fact that youre describing your own character as snarky and rude generally a jerk means theyre not a Gary Stu. It sounds like the person youre roleplaying with has some trouble distinguishing IC drama from rl stuff and that can be a bummer when playing villaintypes my favorite! or just rude chars.Youre also recognizing that what happened IC would affect your characters outlook and perspective. Sometimes events can change characters in a direction us authors dont want  and thats okay to admit that theres some directions we dont want. Whats regrettable is that youve just realized this after its happened.Not sure if you mean how to get over the IC drama for your char or OOC drama. But some options include either scratching that thread from the character timeline accepting it and rping out the consequences or just abandoning the char to do something more in line with what you want.,Roleplay,da7eq27,2,t5_2qrxs
