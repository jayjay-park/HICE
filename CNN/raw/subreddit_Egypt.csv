Now you are talking just like real Zionists who justify occupying Palestine to protect their citizens. This isnt the first time Russia expands too ... ignoring the past as well as the present will repeat the same mistakes againEgypt moving from USA to Russia is retarded. If the USA played us under the table Russia flipped the entire table on us before. We are just going from bad to worseThis isnt about Bassem this is about people glorifying Russia just because they now consider the USA its enemy.

933705,0,t3_24t3qk,Having experienced a power outage number  midway through the interview I didnt get to see much. Despite that throughout most of the interview he gave me the impression of him being soft spoken perhaps a bit too soft spoken. There were of course a couple of times where he retaliated against Ibrahim Eissa for using the word Junta Askar and him vowing that the brotherhood will cease to exist should he be president.Also the fact that this interview as well as the interview with the other channels that was broadcasted yesterday are both prerecorded with plenty of editing done with them is kind of telling. With all the lovey dovey terms and mannerisms he has been using throughout the interview as well as the hearsay stories he has of when he was with MorsiKhairat el Shater and others Im not all that confident about his own confidence. They are certainly propping him up and putting him on the pedestal hard. And would someone please tell me what exactly is his presidential program besides reestablishing security?

4614561,0,t1_ctc75nd,Imothats the new trend for most of the private universities now. They contactget in touch with other universities outside of Egypt offering the degree outside of egypt in that university during the period of graduation example last year or semester of graduation. So theres not really much difference between private universities there its all in how the courses are taken and how much information they give you per course and how solid the course is. Personally i wouldnt go for other options for engineering private universities besides GUCGerman University in Cairo AASTMT and AUC. Very few people would recommend you otherwise aswell. Even the ones in lets say MIU or MSAMTI they tell you that if you want to grasp the whole idea of engineering and youre serious about it they will recommend you not to choose from outside of those  amongst private universities for engineering. On that note GUC has a credible degree great campus terrible management sadlythough. a very solid learning curve  abit steep for some people butagain not as hard as ASU. they also have lots of activitiescoursesprograms in germany  and in egypt. Youre really going to do work for your degree there as it gives you the whole grasp of engineering and more. AASTMT on the other hand has an extra smooth learning curve they kinda throw out unnecessary lectures or lectures not needed or delay it in another course. so they divide the average course of lets say a typical GUC course into . Still a very credible university aswell as it gives you enough to wrap up the main idea of engineering.,Egypt,ctc8u72,2,t5_2ql2m

I dont know whether you are white or Arab or what but if you are obviously foreign you will be harassed. A lot. People try to sell you things they lie to you to try and convince you to go with them and give them money. This is not the majority of Egyptians but you have to be prepared. Things are even worse at the pyramids  you must ignore everyone or tell them to leave dont be afraid to be aggressive in your rejections. Move quickly past the people until you get to the ticket booth. This is just to make sure you have a good time in Egypt and dont get scammed. You just have to be confident and assertive and trust no one who walks up to you on the street. That said if you ever need directions then feel free to ask someone especially if they look homeless or poorer  often they will speak English and you can give them a couple of Egyptian Pounds for their help. In general be prepared to tip everyone. Oh and take taxis everywhere but only use the white ones. The black ones will rip you off. White ones have to have a meter. If you get in and they tell you its broken but offer you a flat price say no thanks and get out again. They are trying to rip you off. Tip good taxi drivers. And have a blast. Its a magical country!Edit just thought to say as well  dont bother staying in Giza for a night. The pyramids are an easy day trip.

Her Father exofficer on the other hand was not as thrilled as the rest of the family  why do you want to marry the foreigner there are many nice Egyptian men?! Which kinda sucks but it doesnt phase me. Essentially I know that ultimately he wants to see his daughter happy. As a side note  Your partner possesses the capability to convince hisher parents on almost anything if heshe is not doing this then I would ask some questions...This aside our engagement was nothing more than a family meal a few pictures were taken with the rings but thats about it  its really not something to be worried about. Many Egyptians spend alot of money on engagement parties we came to the conclusion that its rather showey for something that may or may not work...

8170166,0,t1_d4yr75k,Youre pulling these figures completely out of your ass. No historian or anthropologist or geneticist has ever estimated k to k Arabs moving into Egypt. This is complete nonsense. In fact Kees Versteegh estimated that the tribal confederation of Hilal Sulaym and Maqil that left Arabia was  to  million people.The ancient Egyptians used semites from Arabia and the Levant as mercenaries in their armies and they brought back slaves from the Levant over thousands of years and there were large minorities of peninsular and Levantine people in Egypt at that time. This is how the worlds first script developed. Egyptian scribes taught the script to Semitic mercenaries who then took it back to the Levant where it evolved into the Phoenician script. Its impossible to tell from modern Egyptians whether their levantine DNA came with the Islamic conquest or from the ancient period.Secondly during the Arabization of the Maghreb the tribal confederations of Banu Sulaym Banu Maqil and Banu Hilal first moved to Egypt. The Fatimid ruler forced them into the Sahara because there were too many bedouins entering Egypt from the peninsula.gtthere is zero chance at the lol man. This paper Ychromosome DNA Haplotypes in North African Populations states that autocthonous north African haplotypes make up approximately  of the Egyptian population  was found to belong to a Semitic haplotype and  to Near Eastern haplotypes. This puts the figure of Egyptians with direct paternal ancestry from the Middle East at nearly . As I stated these could be very ancient immigrants or recent immigrants. This doesnt even test for admixture and in those tests Egyptians fall right next to other Arabs. The populations of Arabic countries are very intermixed with one another.,Egypt,d4ytj8a,6,t5_2ql2m

So looking at your Y haplotype and your MtDNA are terrible indications of who you are today. TLDR if I move to Nigeria and marry a Nigerian woman and my children marry Nigerians then in a few generations my grandchildren will have a  Middle Eastern Y haplotype and absolutely no other Middle Eastern genetics and they will look like any other Nigerian. Are they still Egyptians because of their Y haplotype? ,Egypt,d4ywggw,1,t5_2ql2m

I dont really want to. I dont want to convert anyone. If you hate my religion I still feel you have a right to that opinion. There are a lot of negative aspects to Islamic culture just as all cultures have some negative aspects. Heres the thing all I want is basic respect. When I was in America I got a lot of harassment about dirty towelhead and other negative comments. Do they really think Im going to be like omg youre so right! Im going to remove it right now.? Does this really help liberate anyone? No its rude. Not directly targeted to you but to all the haters just be polite. Just because you dont like me or my way of life is not a reason to harass me. And if you feel the problem is oppression of women why target the women? Go talk to the men.     I recently read a memoir by Deborah Feldman about her unhappy and oppressive life as an ultra orthodox jew. I came away with a very negative view of that culture. But that would never lead me to go on a crusade against ultra orthodox  Judaism and I would never insult or be mean to a person of that group. Because it wouldnt help.
