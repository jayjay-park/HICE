If they want to make it a bit darker I think thats fine but throwing in pointless sex scenes to me just feels like theyre screaming SEE?? ITS NOT FOR KIDS!! ITS MATURE!! SEE?? It just reeks of pointless edginess. ,EmeraldCity,dc6b0hn,3,t5_2si81

Selfpreservation has a strong pull too.But after watching Sylvie and Lucas choose notDorothy I cant blame her for feeling betrayed and riding off without them.Shell side with the Wizard because hes the one device she has to get home. Selfpreservation emotionally and physically since home is the only place she understands how to survive. She sure wouldnt have made it without the man who just flipped sides on her after all. Now shes alone again in freak world triggering fight or flight or both since she did those in the span of  minutes.,EmeraldCity,ddxe14x,8,t5_2si81
