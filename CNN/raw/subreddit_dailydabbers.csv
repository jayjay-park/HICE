10769881,0,t1_ddqtb26,Not all the vapor that gets cooled ends up condensing phases of matter arent that binary. The temperatures happen in a gradient. Some of the vapor that comes through the rig will be hotter than other vapor and the water brings the overall temperatures lower. The large bubbles of vapor cool more than you think its really about increasing the amount of time the vapor is in the rig when a percolator is filled with water the bubbles and eddies that come through force the vapor to swirl around a lot more and it takes a longer path through the rig and thats whats doing most of the cooling.Your hypothesis seems wrong to me because Ive taken small dry dabs that were harsher than a dab three times as large through water. Its definitely not just a smaller hit with water.,dailydabbers,ddqu0of,16,t5_3axkx
10782772,0,t1_dds5rtl,you have the HexNail which might not be out yet commercially though review units have been sent DNail and thats really it for big brand nonDHGate enails.

This topic was more relevant to new groups i havent posted in before relax and enjoy some education.

11137299,0,t3_5yt0hd,Cooking is irrelevant. You cook at the temp the recipe requires. Too much exposure to heat will vaporize thc and then it wont be in your edible.The reason you vape flower at lower temps is because you are trying to avoid combustion and reduce contaminants by only going slightly above the boiling point of the thc. That way the plant matter doesnt burn and things with higher boiling points dont come out as much in the vapor. When you dab youre starting with a concentrate which has the plant matter and contaminants removed. Since theres nothing to combust you can use a higher temp to get much more vapor much quicker.You also seem to be confused about units of measurement. Im pretty sure your cooking and vaping temps are in Celsius and your dabbing temps are in Fahrenheit. Nobody dabs at c and nobody vapes at f. ,dailydabbers,deuegy4,1,t5_3axkx

11170839,0,t3_5zhn5d,The issue Im seeing is a clear dissonance between what people want out of this subreddit. Some people just want to see pretty much whatever oilrelated pictures and some people want to see gram pictures and explanation.But the bottom line is that this sub doesnt get near enough content and doesnt have a tenth of the subs to start enforcingbanning people based on anything really. What I see every time I come to this sub is maybe four people contributing. Id post if I was in a legal state and Im sure many people have the same problem as me.,dailydabbers,dey7b0p,3,t5_3axkx

11557469,0,t1_dg5xl2k,Neither am I? this is just going off my fairly limited AP chemistry knowledge from high school two years ago. Who do you think I am? You seem rather invested in this guy I went back through your post history and theres a lot of mentioning him Im just trying to not get my actual account banned here like you do to everyone who opposes you and proves you wrong about something. so heregtWould an ethanol test come back with the same results and impurities?Yes it absolutely would. and with a higher water content too since its so hygroscopic. hell look at the evaporation residue amount its listed at less than the lowest they can test down for so realistically its a pure substance. as pure in chemistry means a substance that has the same chemical composition throughout.gtRegardless its not food safe and considered toxic while ethanol is sold in millions of stores specifically for human consumption.You do realize that the body is capable of processing Iso up to a specific amount and at that point instead of it entering the blood stream as an intoxicant like ethanol the body converts it to Acetone otherwise its really not toxic if you ingest less than the several liquid ounces needed to overload your body.gtCertain pesticides affect humans on the microgram scale why cant other impurities?because the impurities that are listed there are not dangerous to humans in the slightest and not at those levels which again are less than a microgram and nearly unquantifiable.,dailydabbers,dg61kce,0,t5_3axkx
