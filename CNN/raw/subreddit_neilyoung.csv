7895837,0,t3_4n2e5h,I seen him in Dublin on Wednesday night very enjoyable concert. I never thought id be luck enough to hear out on the weekend live considering im only  and only really started listening to his music over the past few years. Its amazing how much stage presence the man still has at  his voice is still fantastic too... the acoustic hits were emotional and the heavier stuff was mind blowing!  ,neilyoung,d43kd3p,3,t5_2s4qb
