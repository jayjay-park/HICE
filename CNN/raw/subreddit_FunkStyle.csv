6085988,0,t3_3yiz4k,Well first of all I would wonder if your technique is correct because popping shouldnt be hurting you. Ive never had arm or knee pain just from the act of hitting with my legs or arms.Second of all good job for letting your body recover thats very important. As to ho to transition back Id say figure out if you were doing something wrong first and then work to correct it. If not as its not something Ive encountered I dont want to give bad or incorrect advice but some mild regular stretching dont go too hard off the start perhaps some fish oil supplements are things that Ive been told to do to keep my joints healthy.,FunkStyle,cyhcorz,2,t5_2wfip

If he doesnt do it usually nothing happens. Finding people to dance with and wanting to dance funkstyles is just getting out there and dancing. Local dance studios clubs bars college classes meeting people and sharing contact information. Designate a time to session and just invite people. ,FunkStyle,d1ngkp3,1,t5_2wfip
