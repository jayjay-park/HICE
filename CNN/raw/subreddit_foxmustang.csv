3652538,0,t1_cq8lw9b,Cool man that should be a solid little . Let me know if you ever get it on the dyno or the track. I bet that thing pulls nice. You should be right under hp and that . should have helped a lot. Id think you could get into the low .s if you could cut about a . ft.Stroking it  wont really get you more power as you mention in your last post. It will give you some TQ but your heads wont flow the extra cubes. I would be surprised if you are at the  cube per hp yet. If you want it to pull at the bottom end more the stroker would be a great option but youll need more cam to make the power. Otherwise start looking into better heads or a cheap vortech. You can usually get a vortech kit for about  used them you could run a blow through carb. Eitherway may that is a bad ass car and props for running a capri I always liked that car. Is it a bubble back?Any thoughts to doing a W or  stroker?,foxmustang,cq8m6l1,1,t5_2un2e

If it is from an  Turbocoupe was it automatic?  That will matter a little bit as the LB came with a more aggressive timing curve to deal with the sluggishness of an automatic transmission.You will probably want to get pieces of the wiring harness.

4128792,0,t3_37xln6,.s. Theyre a good streetable compromise and the shortest that you can correct the speedometer with the tooth speedo drive gear. Be aware that you will also want to purchase an aluminum driveshaft as the factory one shakes like a mofo at higher speeds with the shorter gears. Plan for the expense. Source .s in my AOD  .s in my  Cobra FMS aluminum driveshafts in both. Having the car feel like it is going to shake itself apart at the top end of the track is NOT fun.Also the tooth speedo gear is a bit of a mismatch with the transmission and will chew itself up over time buy a couple of them. Youll know its trashed when the speedo rises and falls erratically at slower speeds.,foxmustang,crqwn7u,1,t5_2un2e
