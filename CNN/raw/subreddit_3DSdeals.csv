6790143,0,t3_48pxez,I will just throw out that I tried to price match GameStop at Best Buy this past weekend for a New DS XL. They would not accept the online price I had pulled up on my phone and instead called the nearest GameStop store to ask the price. The store gave BB the wrong price . so I left empty handed.They stated the price match policy is for local competitors.

U unfortunately feels about as stiff as the older PSPSP Monster Hunter games but U completely revamped the gameplay and Id say its the first game in the seriously to truly feel fresh and inviting to players of all skill levels.If you like action games amp are willing to put the time in and learn how to master a couple weapons then you should do just fine.
