4610741,0,t1_ct6dv04,Im sorry this is such a late reply but I actually do not have a file called wolfconfig.cfg and Default.clg only pertains to key bindings.,gamesupport,ctbrloa,1,t5_2t9kj

4782096,0,t1_ctxa6b5,Its a beta... Really should be alpha. It doesnt even have redstone yet. From my understanding its supposed to be optimised and finally ditching Java. Its a long way off being finished though.,gamesupport,ctxbnna,2,t5_2t9kj
6033964,0,t3_3x5v1a,Apparently there were problems if you launched it with Fraps or something? Do you have Fraps or Bandicam or anything like that?,gamesupport,cyakgwc,1,t5_2t9kj

6402126,0,t1_czhbytb,They are definitely better but not insanely so. Like I said it takes DOUBLE the power to run games at the new laptops screen resolution. My suggestion as framerate is generally a bit more important than looks lower the resolution of the game a bit. Should get you some frames back. But to be honest the performance you are getting is too be expected for the power that computer has. Even with dedicated graphics that is still not a gaming laptop by any means.,gamesupport,czhcv6r,1,t5_2t9kj

6787028,0,t1_d0lcvog,thats not necessarily a bad thing. that card is older so it would make sense that the game is maxing it out as it is using all of the resources it possibly can to give the best possible performance. c is not that bad for a stock air cooler either.,gamesupport,d0llifm,2,t5_2t9kj
