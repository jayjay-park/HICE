160554,0,t3_1vxhmd,There was this one time I had a cigar.  Party in my mouth.  Specifically was a Perdomo yr Champagne.  As soon as I lit it up beautiful purple smoke billowed from the cigar.  It smelled like cocaine and sugar.  I put on a  wolves shirt drove to walmart before the first third even burned up.  I was instantly met by several hot women.Im going to smoke these things all day.  They taste like unicorn blood and fucking cedar.,MisterBastahrd,cewpxqa,1,t5_2ztzz
