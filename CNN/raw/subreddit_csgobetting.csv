659607,0,t1_cgf4whq,Definitely agree. It must have been Leg Workouts because the Biceps wernt in action for the first set of games against Dig. However I think its Bicep time now. I dont see VP losing two Bos in one day after an amazing performance in the past few matches.Plus although I have to give HUGE props to Titan for their amazing comeback on T side of Nuke then again they had to COME BACK against LDLC to get the victory. It goes both waysable to clutch under pressure but also the fact is that they got into that position. VP have stated that theyre a snowballmomentum team. If you let VP have a  round lead over you the game is basically as good as over they just have too much momentum. Think back to the awesome plays on Inferno vs Titan and taking it to OT then winning the game . They stormed back down a TON of rounds and then wiped the floor after they picked it up into OT with  straight rounds. Its no joke I think people are undervaluing VP because they lost  to Dig but as much as I think Dig is a version of CM we ARE talking about the Katowice Winners here. If VP get the ball rolling on any of the maps and build up momentum I just dont see Titan able to replicate their performance against LDLCyou just cant get  rounds in a row against VP in a clutch situation. Good time to double up Ive bet on VP and Im hella excited for this match and the Grand Finals tomorrow ?. Best of luck to both teams I hope this match will be amazing and hope that VP will come out on top for a rematch with Dig in the finals. ,csgobetting,cgf8wj3,1,t5_2zume

The problem is once a bet is made you cant cancel it but CSGO lounge also give no benefit to the better to watch games and allow to change their team that is actively playing in a later scheduled matchIf these leagues on going to flash CSGOlounge all over their streams and websites I think their should be more legitmate and closer locked bets to when the match actually starts.  CSGL uses the info from casters about when the games are over and who won to start drafting items why cant they use that info for when the game actually is starting and bets will close?Ive won my fair share of bets and Ive lost bets.

915768,0,t1_ch8dghy,The big thing is that VP have had a lot of problems with closing their matches even if they were in a good position to win them. NiP are the better team on train but last time they met VP won on train but threw next  maps resulting in NiP winning the CPHG. I think that one of the reasons why VP won katowice was because they werent under such pressure with the polish fans all over the place so they had no problems closing the matches. Like TaZ is old and experienced enought to tell them something like  we should stop throwin yo  and if he does that they could win this tournament and Dreamhack summer. They deffinietly have the aim and strategies to be the best but the only problem is closing the matches and you cant really know wheter they throw untill they actually do and you lose all your skins that is what makes them so unpredictable.

First of all they have only one loss with that loss being  to  as close as possible without overtime and the rest are wins albeit some are defwins. Also quite a few wins of Team Refuse are crushing victories with scores like  to  etc. The wins of CD are a lot closer. something like  etc. And anytime that CD has played decache they have lost. In fact they already lost to Team Refuse once on the same exact map. Should be easy for Team Refuse.Edit Apparently Team Refuse is also home team and therefore get to chose sides. This will give them another advantage as they can choose the side they prefer. And decache is not particularly sided so if they dont do too well in the first half they can just as easily catch up in the second half.Edit  On the match of Team Refuse versus CD Team Refuse won  to .

I doubtlessly could have read more carefully.I dont think you needed to be so condescending though I mean jesus you were DRIPPING with attitude. Sorry if my apparently irrelevant comment upset you that badly.Re TLDR Yeah that was kind of my point. My entire post was written under the incorrect assumption of a betting viewpoint. I try to look at bets in a rational way which is tough when its something as streaky as sportsesports.If youre trying to make an even somewhat educated bet you need to have your own idea of what chance a particular team has of winning that game. Because its basically impossible to know who will be on fire that day hence the coin flip you mentioned all you have to fall back on is history and consistency and sometimes other outside knowledge such as injuries substitutions events going on that may affect individual playersthe team in a positive or negative way etc. but you dont always have this information.. There is a fairly strong emphasis on a teams recent history due to the nature of esports. Decide what you think their chances are compare it to the odds bet on the team that seems undervalued in the odds.Unless youre telling me thats wrong I dont think we have any further argument.P.S. Ive seen some stupid shit and horrible predictions on this subreddit so I didnt feel like I could assume this. I agree its the only logical way.P.P.S.

1122580,0,t1_chvvbww,Dignitas  Virtus ProDiggy has been on a roll lately and crushed titan whereas VP looked a little bit shaky against LDLC but both of these teams are top and if VP plays like they normally canmore consistentbetter aim then it is a tossup pretty .  is definitely unjustified in this matchup.,csgobetting,chvwc81,0,t5_2zume
1122622,0,t3_26yz9a,Betting is always difficult. In this game especially. Its hard to predict a winner here even it is a best of  game. Also i want to mention befor my analyse that i take no stock in this analyses about the last  games or sth. I read all comments here and i think Dignitas and VP played really good today. Dignitas fight against Titan wasnt as easy as some people think Dignitas was just on fire and they studied Titan. Dignitas have a really good teamplay and can change their gameplay every round with new features. Titans players are monsters aimmonsters like NBK and Scream who always can be match winner but their tactics are mostly about picking the first so they have room to play with. Dignitas just didnt give them much chance to do this.LDLC vs VP was closer indeed. VP had still some probs on Inferno to get the rounds they need. Apex and Happy are really aggressive players and they can change the whole game if they start getting crazy but VP was too experienced to get overrolled by them. Dignitas will have a adventage at the following mapsInferno Nuke  mapsseason chacheVP will have the adventage at the following mapsdust mirage trainthe maps i think will be played IF THEY VETO LIKE I THINK THEY WILLInferno dust season . Dignitas will veto Mirage. VP will veto Nuke. Dignitas will veto train. Vp will veto chacheto concludeDignitas and VP are strong teams and both are on fire because they want to win. It is a  gamePredict winner VPWho i will bet on Just relax and enjoy the game without betting on this,csgobetting,chvwif7,4,t5_2zume

Even ignoring strategies both teams have the raw skill to put up a great fight against each other.Every single factor points towards a small bet on Titan or not risking money on NIP.And last of all we got a fucking great game from that map.

1627980,0,t3_2cy9jk,If theres such as a momentum based team then Titan is a great example of it. When they are winning they are on fire and play great make good calls think carefully hold bombsites solidly and overall their performance is up to their full potential. But when they start to lose rounds it almost seems they start to panic a little make rushed decisions force buys in an attempt to break the losing streak but due to these decisions they spiral downwards even more and I reckon this is the reason why people call Titan inconsistent. I believe that they have a harder time mentally overcoming losing rounds than most of the professional teams out there for some reason.In yesterdays game versus Virtus.pro we could pretty much see the Titan that I described above. It seems only kennyS was able to break that mental barrier I was talking about and he could play like he does he managed to get into his comfort zone where he felt confortable playing the way he does able to unleash his full talent and potential and at least keep Titan in this game so that they can have a fighting chance against Virtus.Pro almost dropping an incredible bomb despite Titan losing. On the other side pasha was the one stepping it up but Virtus.Pro seemed more calm overall and this gave them the edge I believe in this game.On the other hand Natus Vincere is a team who has a really specific playing style. They carefully and throughly scope out the other teams defenses their setup try to find their weak points and make their decisions strats based on that. GuardiaN is also a really strong resource in Natus Vincere that they depend on. They often rely on him getting picks setting up the numbers advantage and execute after that. Having a playstyle this specific can help you but can also hurt you as well big time. If the other team can force their playstyle on Natus Vincere then they will be in deep trouble. We could see a great example of this in yesterdays game versus TeamLDLC.com. After a  CT half from  Natus Vincere it almost seemed that there was no hope at all for TeamLDLC.com but they changed up their playstyle and played quite an agressive CT half pushing Natus Vincere quite often getting the early picks therefore rendering Natus Vinceres strategy and playstyle pretty much useless. Adding up to this TeamLDLC.com managed to keep their opponents economy really low forcing GuardiaN to pick up a rifle instead of an AWP. Furthermore by the end of the game they also seemed to panic a little and force buys instead of saving one round and having a full buy the next with proper grenade sets and such which probably also committed to Natus Vinceres defeat of .Given these I believe that the best option is to skip the first game as it is and just watch the teams performance and see which Titan and which Natus Vincere shows up tonight and then make your decision if you want to bet on the second game. Both Titan and Natus Vincere are more than capable of beating the other team. Keep in mind that this is ESEA and there is a home team and an away team. The home team picks the side that they start on which can give a team an edge as well. Also the map they play on will be crucial of course. After the first game the odds are going to shift a little most likely towards the winner of the previous match. Just some things to consider I guess.Im not sure if Im going to bet myself seeing the two teams that are going to be facing each other are considered to be pretty inconsistent. Ive won quite some lately and dont want to rush myself into a match which could go either way. Unless the odds go ridiculously in favor of one team then maybe a small underdog bet is applicable on the first game.,csgobetting,cjkde7r,7,t5_2zume

1647712,0,t3_2d743d,Like a lot of people have pointed out HR are known for being inconsistent. On the other hand Mousesports are coming off a nice run at Gfinity G in London where they beat Virtus Pro in a group stage Bo and later took Fnatic to overtime on the third! map of a Bo. That progress was buoyed by the dominant performance of allu who was one of the tournaments top players. Such a performance later today could surely turn the tides of a match against an inconsistent HR squad even with kzy subbing in for nooky. If ChrisJ finally flashes his skill alongside allu then this match will be even closer. All in all Id put this match at  for HR with some upset potential. Im holding off on a calling the upset certain only because Mouz has a sub and theres also no telling if ChrisJ will return to form and pick up some slack for the sub while taking pressure off allu. ,csgobetting,cjmuvx5,1,t5_2zume

1664410,0,t3_2dfcfy,Ill add my bets just for more info even though I suck at betting. Thanks for this though  very usefulHR  Epsilon  HR fanboy here  high on HR. Also  HR has been bootcamping like CRAZY whereas epsilon has been shaky recently. All of HRs players have gt CSGO hours in the past  weeks. Assuming they sleep  hours a night thats almost  of all their waking hours spent practicing. Not to mention thats just the past  weeks  theyve actually been bootcamping since DHV. LC  LDLC  Unfortunately I dont know a lot about either team. I bet on LDLC at  but if LC goes back around  odds Ill bet on them. No info of my own here just going off what was said in the match thread. Medium on LDLC for now.Navi  CW  Again I dont know a lot about CW. Navi looked pretty shaky in their SLTV matches a few days ago but Im confident theyll pull it together for LAN. Theyve said they care most about the big events duh so Im confident that theyll come out on a tear. However this is another match where if odds go to CW  Ill switch. Mediun on NaVi.dAT  VP  VP seems pretty easy here. Again I know little about dAT except theyre russian and I never trust russian teams. VP is just so consistent taking st at G st at Katowice beating an onfire Dig and a strong titan team in london. Im sure theyve been bootcamping but I dont have any actual info. Low on VP wouldve gone medium but I didnt have enough skins PDig  Vox  Ive heard a lot of great things about Vox and looking at their HLTV scores and stats they look pretty strong TBH. I put like  cents on Vox for that potential value.C  Titan  Really hard match to bet on. You have C the LAN gods but then Titan with ScreaMKennyS aka  combined frags or . Recently Titan has been very strong nd and G is no joke. However the odds on this match are flickering like crazy  they went from  titan to  C and back now to . I went medium on Titan when it was . Ill basically bet on whoever is the underdog when match time rolls around.NiP  Wolf  Odds on NiP are so shit that I just put  cents on wolf. Not much else to say here. Wolf looks really weak after watching their india qualifiers match and NiP could problably win this even if frest were in jail. I just dont have the inventory to bet enough on NiP to get a return.TBDa LCLDLC  TBDb NaViCW  I think NaVi beats CW and I really like the chances of whoever loses LCLDLC. My only fear is that LC loses hard and then loses their confidence but I think that they got enough experience from Gfinity to stay calm. Medium on TBDa.TBDa DigVox  TBDb CTitan  I went medium on digvox. Literally no analysis here I had more items to bet and this was the match I liked the most. I guess my thought process was that if dig loses they will likely beat CTitan and if Vox loses then again I like the  underdog chances. Fnatic  IBP  Another match where I feel like its totally . Im keeping my skins on the underdog. Fnatic was on an absolute TEAR at Gfinity but IBP has been bootcamping for  weeks and steel said theyre very very confident. So thats my crappy analysis!

1685491,0,t3_2d1ptm,My initial roster consisted of kennyS Titan Snax Virtus Pro Fifflaren NiP aizy dignitas and Guardian Natus Vincere. I picked kennyS Snax and Guardian because they are consistent players and even for a hefty price I know what Ill be getting from them. Fifflaren and aizy were my wildcards with Fifflaren playing against Wolf on the first day and aizy being a player full of potential on a very strong team.On the second day I kept aizy and Snax and picked up Edward semphis and olofm to round out my team. I saw that olofm and Edward were both producing very well for their price and liked the matchups they were playing on the day so I decided to go with them. For semphis he was basically my replacement for Fifflaren because of the potential to play  maps on the day.For the third day my roster will be Snax aizy olofm flusha and FeTiSh.

However the map is mirage which is SKDCs best map They defeated Lunatik   . And looking at Lunatiks previous scrims we can see that Lunatiks had been practicing Mirage so this means that theyre more prepared than ever. The odds right now are currently SKDC  Lunatik    but I think its more of a    to   . Again very close match so Ill bet medium on SKDC considering theyve been practicing Mirage and have more experiences that Lunatik,csgobetting,cjw1fsn,0,t5_2zume

1721863,0,t1_cjw6zhf,Looks sketchy at the first view but at a second look its not. He throws the smoke and looks around the corner and aims exactly there he probably thought maybe there is a little opening and I could look through it but there wasnt. He knew there were players there which he stopped from going through. By throwing the smoke he blocked his own view and made the guys think they could safely pass. My guess is that this was predicted by him and thats why he threw the smoke in the first place and why he is aiming at the smoke close to the edge to see if a player tries to come through. One comes through and he gets him. The other one made a jump noise etc. and he could hear him also there was still smoke which probably lightly blocked the terrors view.Also as a side note you should never decide if someones cheats based on one sketchy scene. Everytime there is the chance of just coincidence if it happens  times you have a pattern and you can consider it really sketchy and look more into it.,csgobetting,cjw7dtz,2,t5_2zume

Its meant to be a line that helps you reinforce your original decision for those who get very finnicky with their bets usually after a loss.In the same vein I didnt mean that second guessing yourself is absolutely wrong. But doubting yourself is pointless unless you have some kind of revelation like oh shit this team was actually only formed  days ago or Fnatics actually stupid good on Inferno!. Most of the time when people are scared to the point where they change their bets its because they see a bunch of people on rcsgobetting throwing  bets on the opposing team or saying little things like Ohh Shox tweeted that he didnt have a good dinner so he probably wont be feeling good or Getrights been posting on Facebook all day so he probably isnt practising!.,csgobetting,ck85kbn,1,t5_2zume

1820192,0,t3_2feljf,Alright so I caught some of Titans game today on Inferno vs. Fnatic so Ill share that. The game started out with a nice v clutch in the pistol round by a former LDLC playerforget which one. Overall it was a strong T half finishing  for Fnatic with Titans more succesful rounds being won on picks and playing rotations while most of their  man rushes ended poorly.  If you look at all of Titans stats for today they were pretty poor especially considering they had a good enough T side to at least get a few rounds in on CT. You wouldnt think from kennyS  that he had a huge ace and besides that I would say he wasnt in his usual form.  As much as I think Titan performed poorly though I do believe that Fnatic played equally as good and more importantly smart. At least two rounds they saved  guns from consecutive rounds that let them buy up thus maintaining an economy and stopped massive critical damage. If it wasnt for this Titan may have ran away with the game.  Conclusion I dont for see frest ddos being a problem so Im not really going to consider that. Ill probably not be the only going somewhat low on Titan considering I just got some inventory to work with which I will be doing. NiP could definetly take this but Im not willing to bet my house in order to make a nickel....back    edit I mean to add that I think AWP is important on Nuke and I think kennyS can provide just that. I really dont know how the odds will play out but Ill probably go low on Titan or just skip it if someone raises more valid points.,csgobetting,ck8ip0f,5,t5_2zume

Also Pita isnt all that amazing of a fragger and he almost never plays. His shot could be very off point.The one thing Im really worried about is how the ping advantage will play out.

1928812,0,t1_cklloty,I dont have an Expert tag yet at least and Ive made some bad bets or thoughtless bets that cost me but I think the thing with this subreddit is that people dont analyze. Most of the top comments are essentially glorified Ez for Team A theyre a good team and I like them better than Team B. They dont look at recent results or map choice sometimes or even Home Team Advantage or fall into hype too much sure NiP got  by LDLC but are you really giving NiP that low odds against Fnatic? Get out of here! Wakeup call for NiP to put on the tryhard pants and this is still the same team as before no changes since forever.I share your frustration though I even left this subreddit for a few months due to a ton of drama and...subpar moderation. I even sent an essay to the Mods with some ideas and tips to clean uphavent heard from them I assume they just brushed it off. They dont really care theyre content to let it just be what it is which really both saddens and angers me. This subreddit does need cleaning up and its the mods job to do so.

2040117,0,t3_2i482z,Dunno why so many bashing VP VP always do well at the beginning of a LAN no matter where theyre starting but they prolly wont win this LAN tbh. I think they have a pretty good chance of getting NaVi though.  Yeh they have had some rough online matches but they still have their core strats and honestly should suffice. Plus they come up with stuff on the spot all the time on LANs i.e. snax crazy cache b main ninja and various other rounds by sir snax. NaVi has just as strong caliber players as well and I expect both teams to be fully awake its right in the morning its going to be when they should be playing at their prime especially for LAN. I expect it to be a really close match Im skipping it myself. NaVi and VP is a pretty good toss up at this point especially for a LAN match.I only bet LAN matches usually and I kinda dont wanna miss this but I just dont know really. I say  and I may throw a small bet for VP if odds stay this way maybe....EDIT I feel silly as fuck. I told myself over and over to never bet on teams with even slight roster changes. I ended up going small on VP only to realize they lost mainly because pasha isnt there???? Whats up with him where is he at? Pasha  Snax literally the combo that wins VP championships.,csgobetting,ckz5751,4,t5_2zume

So all in all I think it will be bo on inferno pretty much. Ibp is great at counterstratting and if they have one day to counterstrat only one map they should be pretty thorough as well as navi likely being pretty easy to counterstrat because of there style which already plays into ibps unique CT side.

Skadoodles awp is far better than Shahzams and swag and azk are both probably the top riflers in NA that are equally as good as many top european teams. Since its a BO even with their ingame leaders dropped previous experiences from european lans will help AZK Skadoodle and swag beat Denial. I think  would be fair odds.I feel that people put too much emphasis on in game leaders. With GetRight Friberg JW Krimz Kennys so many rounds can be won just by their frags alone.

2433056,0,t3_2nbisu,Alright I think Ill do an analysis since what is on this thread is really pretty trash at the moment. Havent done one of these in a while... Torqued vs mouseSpaz  BO  Torqued put up some solid games and performances in the CEVO games that they played in the last couple of weeks. They have a great deal of individual skill and ability  and certainly have enough confidence in themselves as a team. However I would be taking their CEVO games with a pinch of salt as these teams were of a much lower skill level than that of Torqued  and particularly steel moE and DaZeD. Also this game will likely be much closer than those and moE and DaZeD certainly arent known for their kindness or teamwork and chemistry in these situations. Coming off the back of their CEVO results? Eh these guys will be confident however that might not be the best thing with the egos of some of the team members on here.mouseSpaz. Im not sure how many people realise  but these guys are actually NetCodeGuides.com minus jdm. Do I think NetCodeGuides arewere a better team then Torqued? Yes. Of course MS have lost jdm however it seems very likely at this point that adreN will fill in with DaZeD saying that on his stream and adreN scrimming with the MS team today and over the last couple days. Although adreN isnt known for his credibility of informationactions cough  saying Anger wasnt playing  cough. adreN is a great player however  and is just as good as if not a better replacement then jdm in most areas other than chemistry. Whilst most people dont believe in what Im about to say I think MS will be looking for a win here if any game is important for them it is this one. This game is a BO which I feel is also in MSs favour as it is more likely that they can get an upset  as I feel that they will start stronger than Torqued if they are playing in any similar way to how they did as NCG. Of course being a BO anything can happen and there is no safety net around it so this is the part of this game that determines whether this is worth your skins.    I wont actually post a prediction as I feel thats where I went wrong with some older ones of mine  I dont want to influence you just give you some information.However based on this information I will say that I do not think that the CSGL odds are near correct for MS the old NCG team  adreN.Good luck.,csgobetting,cmcfkb1,8,t5_2zume
2433944,0,t3_2nbisu,Hitbox Arena  Mousepaz vs Torqued bo. Recommended Bet If odds remain sub  Max on Torqued. Risk Medium.I dont really see Torqued having an issue winning this bo. Theyve been playing pretty well together during the CEVO placement tournament handing multiple teams brutal losses showing good team chemistry. As for MouseSpaz it looks like they are trying out a new five and dont look to be as strong as they were during the tail end of last season. adreN could provide a different dynamic being able to aggressively awp for them but I still give Torqued the advantage. Personal odds  Torqued mainly because its a bo and anything can happen. ,csgobetting,cmcji8p,-1,t5_2zume

Fnatic completely outguns and out strats this eLevate squad. Unless they purposefully try to get to the lower bracket were going to see a  Fnatic with score lines around   imo.

RhyThm vs VeXX        Notes  Please know I am not a high better like most of the analyst. My highest bet is usually around . My lowest bet is usually around  cent. My average bet is usually around . I am growing my inventory slowly but steadily continually rising for  months. The more money I win the higher my average bet will become. I do this for fun more than anything. Currently I have a  inventory.  Map  denuke    CSGLounge Odds   RhyThm   VeXX     My Odds   RhyThm   VeXX    Conclusion  If the reports of RhyThm not practicing Nuke is true that is a big deal.  Yes VeXX only managed  rounds on CT side against Lunatik the other night but Lunatik was expected to take the map considering VeXX are not strong on it.  To me any practice is better than no practice.  Also considering we are talking about Nuke here whoever starts CT will likely take the match.  That being said with odds being so tilted I suggest a lowICB on VeXX if you must bet.  I feel a bet on RhyThm is a bad bet but that doesnt mean they wont win.      Prediction  VeXX win .     Risk Level  High.   My Bet  ICB on VeXX.,csgobetting,cmrbqjz,0,t5_2zume

2580711,0,t1_cmvfcxd,or a notsomoderate topkek?On a more serious note Am I the only one who thinks that CSGL Odds are stupid right now? Anything going in favor of Sweden seems ridiculous to me. Why? Because Poland has  Players of a Top team one of their regular standins and innocent who has proven to be a valuable addition playing strong within the polish lineup aswell as with ESC. On Overpass Poland looked pretty poor to be honest considering it was their pick. But on Cobble  which France picked and probably thought to win easy peasy due to them having the worlds best AWP  very good AWPs on Happy apeX  they really surprised. I honestly think France thought that they just outawp Poland on Cobble. On top of that France looked like they had some shit prepared for Cobbelstone. And Poland adjusted more or less perfectly. In the end it was a very close match which Neo could have ended...if he doesnt get noscoped by kennyS. People also seem to put too much weight on the fact that Sweden played  vs France while Poland got ed. While this is obviously true Sweden only had to play D amp Inferno where every player is able to run around blindfolded and still find their way. Imo its a huuuuge difference if you have to face France on DInferno or OverpassCobblestone.Sweden while also having decent players is not as worldclass as the polish lineup. Pronax is known for being a true mastermind. The rest while having astonishingly good moments is decent at best.

2628753,0,t3_2q0fru,This should end up being iBP vs Torqued unless an upset happenswhich probably wont.IMO iBP should take this easily unless someone dies from fatigue or some shit mid match. Torqued can land their shots as well as iBP but their chemistry is so.... off. Yeah they have been playing together for a while but if youve watched Steels streams everyone talks over his calls.cough Torqued vs mSpaz yesterday. iBP is a better team overall IMO as seen by the close series yesterday vs mSpaz which lost . They got much better since the mSpaz game with Hiko and Dazed getting more accustomed to the strats. If the odds stay under  for iBP just bet med on them I made the mistake of putting  on iBP already. If the odds stabilise right now Id suggest an ICB on Torqued as I cant discount them for being a good team and they can definitely take iBP if me and steel shows up and not rages for the first time in forever. TLDR iBP should take this but Torqued can upset. ICBLow on Torqued if lt medium on iBP if lt. Personal odds  in favour of iBP.Take my opinionanalysis with a grain of salt as Im sleep deprived. Anyways good luck with your bets DEdit  Welp Lunatik is showing up. iBP has some really predictable T side strats on Cache and they are getting shut down dayum. We may be seeing Lunatik vs Mythic and Im not sure how thats gonna end up.WHY THE HELL DID I PUT  WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME,csgobetting,cn1poik,1,t5_2zume

Despite that I really dont think that this match will be... suspicious like some of Torqued games.Due to recent events with myRev throwing incidents  in my humble opinion  should disappear for a moment  maybe for a few days maybe for a few weeks  due to heat and cslounge experimental policy.If I had a chance to earn some money by having a... temporary loss of all my CS skills  aka  thrw  Id really reconsider this moment as a suitable for this kind of thing. Im not judging Torqued saying that they are thrwing or not but I know one thing  they certainly are not stupid and that is why any thrw accidents should not occur this time.Regarding my bet  Ill be betting on Torqued a small ammount  ICB  and I really suggest doing so  of course if you NEED to bet . This is either a SKIP or ICB Im quite curious about this game to be honest and I should watch if carefully.Best regardsA.,csgobetting,cngqykr,-1,t5_2zume

2757383,0,t3_2rmzfv,My first time  AdaptBloominator HandleDdb inVert draWsouL nsmWinoutMIBZ decipLe jacoBson stENoOo planksSo this matchup is interesting and in my opinion the odds are very very juicy.  days ago these  teams faced and while I didnt watch it the scoreline was  for adapt show that something was wrong on winouts side. They did have a sub Exnowmythic agM which Im not sure how much that affected their play or team cohesion. Planks and Jacobson in my eyes have always been the star players of winout though they are extremely inconsistent which could have been a factor in their past matchup. Not to count adapt out though their team is a very strong group that have been playing for some time and with bloominators IGLing and Inverteds awping I think they are quite a good team a lot of fragging power with mason and drawsoul. They always seem to be consistent fraggers but never go off like the boys on winout do they jut find the frags to get the round and close it out.Current odds  adapt vs  winoutPersonal odds  adapt vs  winoutItll be fun too see how these teams do with their current full rosters lel NA shuffle.My bets ,csgobetting,cnhi4nx,-1,t5_2zume

2768549,0,t3_2ro5yr,Main reasons for my bet on SKDC varrsity not playing on desecrate OMNIFLY playing instead SKDC are esea invite vs. desecrate who are open SKDC scrim match history is convincingly good desecrate scrim history is ok  based on scrims SKDC have better overall map results which is crucial in a boSome things to keep in mind the tier difference between SKDC and desecrate isnt that big as opposed to something such as ldlc vs winout hypothetical example only  members on SKDC are original members they have  new players not much information known on desecrateWill update with more points if I have the time. Very risky bet imo but judging on the maps looks like desecrate arent so good on overpass whereas SKDC hardly practice mirage so if desecrate get mirage in they could take  map off SKDC. Overall SKDC should win but anything can happen. The better team should win in a bo but who knows. Safest thing to do is skip. Too bad I love taking risks even if its a stupid one.

If you are going to compare Aimfaces perfromance with ATN then you shouldnt pick a game that was from . iNationAimface as a team might have improved over the past year when they were playing. Its like if I compared a Fnatic vs NiP game from Jan  March  and then a NiP vs ESC game from two weeks ago in order to bet on this Fnatic vs ESC game. Even if the players were the exact same the skill level of both teams changed dramatically over a year. My point is that if you are going to compare two teams against one another you should probably not pull up games longer than  months thats my personal opinion. ,csgobetting,cnmma87,1,t5_2zume

The temptation of easy money for doing literally nothing is what people lose their shit over. Pun not intended it will be always be a consideration for any team. Oh this team could easily get bajillion dollars if they throw but only  dollars if they win the tournament. Most teams most likely wont throw but it will always have to be put into consideration when betting. Some of my point will make sense and probably some wont. Its late but theres an obvious theme.

And by that I mean it would literally cause the site to shut down forever because users would be SO pissed.... This whole betting scene is prone to corruption and dysfunction. Ive learned to expect it and to just accept it when it happens. I dont blame Lounge because they arent the ones who are perpetrating any of the shady stuff.

3076341,0,t1_cogu184,Well. You mustve misunderstood my explanation as I didnt mean to say that just because they play against T teams makes them a T team. What I was trying to say that eventho they are considered a T team they have a number of upsets against T teams and eventho they lose to them its not a total stomp like you would normally expect from T vs T games. This For me considers them as a mid TT team. This is just like the same case as CLG when they were NCG. but ESC for me is better than that. But idk man as I said Its my opinion not yours.

They put up numerous amount of rounds against Cloud once more in Clutchcon playoffs losing  on Cache and losing once more  on Nuke. They have been playing to their potential and I believe soon enough theyll be another tier  team in North America.                                                          LunatiK has been losing all their games and their last win was against Area winning . They look like they are struggling a lot lately and double OT on Overpass against Area and Area are quite terrible on this map and they have admitted it as well.

3149912,0,t3_2w858g,I missed the Fnatic vs NiP game. Was it close at all? Thinking about a  underdog bet but am not sure how their previous match went. If NiP got destroyed I dont want to take my chances with Fnatic already up one map. However if VP takes this series I might try my money with VP heating up and giving Fnatic a good game. Decisions.Edit After checking back on the last match NiP vs Fnatic I am confident in NiP as it was a close last game. Lets see how this VP NiP game goes but I could see both teams having a decent chance. If VP vs Fnatic maybe a small  bet but if NiP and Fnatic meet again I might go a little bit higher seeing how close the last match was.Edit Ended up going  on VP. Sweet payout of  so lets go VP! I am confident that they will heat up and give Fnatic a good game. Edit Well RIP to my skins. Started off well but it looks like Im back to the drawing board after this  losing streak hope its just a dry streak and Ill be back at it soon. I feel like most of my recent bets have been a little random. The  on VP was a high risk I understand but the SKDC and ASC I feel like I could have skipped.

For example you said you lost on Fxfire vs FlyingV sure you could look at the team on paper and be thinking yeah Fxfire is gonna win this but if youre really trying to profit youd realize its a  game between some weak NA teams and then bet small on FlyingV since the odds on CSGL were .

The map is overpass which Fnatic was good on before the changes and theyve beat  nV on it since then which is a good sign for today. VP played ok vs NiP yesterday but frest and GTR both underperformed massively on nuke which caused the loss.

You cant just say DWG beat  teams on nuke and Aftershock lost to  teams on nuke therefore DWG is better at nuke... What Im saying is that the teams DWG played on nuke are WAYYYYYYYYY worse than the teams aftershock played and not taking that into account is pretty stupid. Cant tell if youre just trying to sway or have no idea what youre talking about but either way good luck with your bets.Personally I think DWG will win this but its a skip for me and a very risky game to bet on.

I have no clue why they forfeit who knows? Im not them. And if you couldnt comprehend my analogy Im saying you believe the bets to go to Ignite because in the league an FFL counts as a loss now imagine this as a football game you bet real money on just like skins are real money and an FFL goes through do you win your bet? fuck no.

One of the teams is basically shit on nuke and vetoes it as often as they can. The other team is one of the top  teams in the world on Nuke and picks it against most teams if they get the chance. How is that not important?When you see a matchup between two teams that are near equally skilled your main concern should be the maps that they are going to play. If this game was played on Inferno I would agree with your analysis. If this was played on D Id say Titan were  favorites. Now its played on Nuke and VP are easily  favorites here.,csgobetting,cp1qyvb,2,t5_2zume

3309802,0,t3_2y1ctp,EDIT My score prediction  Denial eSports  Luminosity GamingDenial eSports looking supersupersupersuper strong this invite season. They have won their past  games with one loss against eLevate .LG havent impressed me at all yet sure theyve taken some wins off of higher end teams but theyve yet to do anything amazing. Currently  in Invite. Anger is usually the deciding factor If he goes crazy they should win if he slows down it will be so much harder.As much as I think denial is favored morale wise and looking so much stronger I would say this is a solid    for Denial. Might be placing small on denial if odds stay  but if odds go under  i will be placing small on LG. Betting small on denial just so I dont lose everything i won from them yesterday Screenshot ,csgobetting,cp5jmhj,0,t5_2zume

3385533,0,t3_2yyf8n,Fnatic havent been challenged in this tournament yet. Theyve had an easy run so far only Navi being a semichallenging opponent but played on a map Navi seem to not know well. That makes it hard to really gauge where theyre at. Yeah theyre smashing teams left and right but those teams would lose to them more often than not regardless of whether Fnatic were at peak form or not.Virtus Pros run also wasnt that difficult with DMax being easily beaten and C making it close but eventually losing out. The game against Keyd today was what Id expect from VP their T sides have left much to be desired recently with their success coming from strong CT sides rather than by taking control in the T half so winning the two games they started CT easily and being pushed to an eventual loss on the map where they started T doesnt surprise me.I think thats where Fnatics advantage lies. Crowd or not Fnatic are capable on either side of a match whereas VP are not. Ive got VP to come  in the overall bet thing but I dont see them beating Fnatic with how theyve played the last few days. Fnatic are a capable T side team as well as a very solid CT side team which was what their initial success was based upon but has since expanded to also being learned about T side stuff.With that said Neo has been playing at his absolute best while Taz has been playing below standard and Byali isnt playing as good as everyone knows he can. So if they pipe up they could really push Fnatic. Like I said earlier its a bit hard to judge Fnatic based on their games since they havent been challenged yet but they all seem to be doing fairly well which is good for them considering how flushajw looked weak in the months leading up to this event.I think Fnatic have a veto advantage in that I think theyre just as good as VP if not better on every single map besides Nuke so Im not sure what theyll veto besides Nuke maybe Mirage too. VP have a map pool that is just as large as Fnatics in that they can play  of the  maps well and are kind of eh on one or two  Dust for them but I think Fnatic are stronger on the maps they know compared to VP. I wouldnt be surprised to see a Cobble pick I know VP are confident on it but Im not sure where Fnatic sit given how lost navi was on the map it doesnt really indicate how they will go on it against strong competition. Im expecting something like InfernoCacheCobble Mirage instead of Cache if Fnatic let VP get that. It definitely favours Fnatic winning  or  depending on where Cobble turns up.So yeah in conclusion I favour Fnatic  or so CSGL odds are about where Id place it  as of posting its  but Ill probably end up betting a bit on VP anyway because Id rather see them win even if it is somewhat unlikely.,csgobetting,cpe6e7d,5,t5_2zume

3552980,0,t1_cpx9gx3,ampampamp Gamblers fallacy sfw gtThe gamblers fallacy also known as the Monte Carlo fallacy or the fallacy of the maturity of chances is the mistaken belief that if something happens more frequently than normal during some period it will happen less frequently in the future or that if something happens less frequently than normal during some period it will happen more frequently in the future presumably as a means of balancing nature. In situations where what is being observed is truly random i.e. independent trials of a random process this belief though appealing to the human mind is false. This fallacy can arise in many practical situations although it is most strongly associated with gambling where such mistakes are common among players.gtInteresting Inverse gamblers fallacy | Gamblers conceit | Law of averages | Statistical regularity Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcpxhl oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecpxhl.

3603387,1,t3_31lrxy,My Thoughts fnatic have definitely been in an online slump. Losing  to NiP is not characteristic of them. I think the update has negatively impacted them but theyll adapt soon enough. VP have been pretty hit or miss on Mirage in recent games. Theyve gotten absolutely destroyed by NiP and took a pretty weird loss against TSM. Theyre known for having a particularly strong Tside on this map but it seems to be somewhat out of sync lately. My Odds amp My Bet    in favor of Fnatic. Ill be going mediumlow on fnatic if the odds stay around   . The current odds are very subject to change based on VPs performance against FSid and TSM so Id wait awhile before betting. EDIT I will be skipping this if fnatics odds go over .,csgobetting,cq30frl,0,t5_2zume

3612254,0,t1_cq4077k,Regardless VP played their style. They were hitting their shots. Flipside were just taking them by surprise and had solid positioning. VP werent playing shitty they were just playing VPs style which F seemed to be able to counter. There were countless times where VPs style worked especially on Nuke but F picked up on that aggression and made VP pay for it. Once VP started playing more defensively they were winning rounds  but thats not VPs style.Edit Having said that NaVi isnt going to be playing VPs aggressive style on CT. Guardian was a beast yesterday and if he maintains that form this should be NaVis series. I have more faith in that then I do in Smple and Worldedit hitting their shots like yesterday.,csgobetting,cq40ubu,2,t5_2zume

Theyve gone head to head with some good EU teams on cache such as VP and beat Orbit twice. The loss that they just had may have an impact on them as well. If Shazam shows up it could be close.Liquid Liquid is a strong team on cache and have beaten the top NA teams on this map I could be wrong and tell me if I am notably absolutely destroying CLG at MLG Xgames on cache. With this being faceit as well Liquid is looking to show up and qualify for the lan as they are looking well in the league.

After getting trounced on Season they both left the server to go to bed not even wanting to play map .They caught a second wind but then went back to playing like shit T side. Was it a throw?

3718845,0,t3_32zgd0,The odds are quite correct as both teams have not done well although Piters losses to USSR and Swag is less acceptable for them than Aces losing to GGWP who is at least slightly better than the other  even thought they lost their best fraggers.Last time Aces upset Piter at a  odds but thats ridiculous odds for a Russian team and betting on Piter then was pure suicidal. Then Aces lost at like  to Piter even with a  map advantage.This conveys the fact that Aces map pool strength may be weaker as they well couldve lost to Weplay on Inferno today. However on Mirage one of Piters better maps they sort of got embarrassed by Swag. I would not want to suggest going big unless you can afford to since both teams look lacklusterish.. but I believe this LAN is better for Aces they kept it close to Flipsid on cobble took advantage of weplays bot playstyles and lost on the puggiest map but at least did not look completely outclassed like Piter was today.,csgobetting,cqg6au8,5,t5_2zume

3723906,1,t3_331x2q,Since no one else has put anything here Ill try my hand at it.USSR has been looking alright as of late. They beat Piter on Inferno  but Aces got crushed by Piter with a score of  USSR did not do very well against FlipSid letting FlipSid steal  rounds on TSide Nuke from them and eventually getting shut down . Aces faced FlipSid on Cobblestone and got  rounds before FlipSid closed it out. These have been the two latest matches for both teams. The last time these teams faced was nearly a year ago when USSR and Aces had a completely separate set of players including flamie on USSR. I would call this match pretty even because of these teams past performances. I would think  for Aces. I will not be betting on this match. If you still want to bet maybe a low to med bet on the underdog.Let me know how I did.Edit Switched around Aces loss against Piter.,csgobetting,cqgr1rl,2,t5_2zume

3747359,0,t3_33awl2,Err ultimate  of the day. I think both teams are roughly around the same skill level. Both teams havent exactly been playing well either so its really hard to predict which team will win. Personally i think although the Ducks lost like the last  games in a row they were against significantly harder opponents  Orbit Dignitas xtence etc. They also have the experience advantage as their players have been playing competitively longer than any of the myXMG members. IDK I might just put a small bet on Ducks and pray. If the odds stretch beyond  then i might swap to myXMG.,csgobetting,cqjfa6z,2,t5_2zume

3749800,0,t3_33anyr,Im slightly biased because my brother plays in exceL but Xenex had a much much harder game yesterday. I would expect both XENEX and exceL to qualify from this group.XENEX As has been pointed out by most people XENEX is made up of betterknown players Rattlesnk was one of the best Source players in the world JT and Sheekey have been playing at a high level for UK not talking EU t here for a long time. Puls used to play with reease who I rate as the best Source player I ever saw. Mole Im not sure. Might be the same MOLE I used to play against. If so he was a good player but not on the same level as the other guys.MALIK are not well known players. This doesnt mean they arent good though. I only caught a few rounds of their game yesterday but the aim seemed strong. However I cannot see them outaiming and outmanoeuvring XENEX. In order to beat them they would have to have laid down some good strats and set smokesflashes. It was not evident from what I saw yesterday that this was the case.MAPSCONCLUSIONS Its impossible to do any kind of map analysis here as there just isnt the information available. What I will say is this FM Esports are currently the best side in the UK on results. Behind FM is XENEX. I honestly cant see MALIK taking this. They will be outaimed outstratted and they do not half the experience that XENEX have.MY ODDS Perhaps I will be proved wrong but I cannot believe these odds. I would with the limited information available make this closer to  in favour of XENEX.,csgobetting,cqjpb5z,4,t5_2zume

Also we dont know how teams will play today will they care? Odds are also skewed. This is TvsT odds atleast should be  for Fnatic. In last matches Fnatic is looking a bit shaky vs T teams. They can win Vs NIp and lose vs TSM. In online matches they look even worse. Sometimes it looks like they dont care or maybe they got day off. Both teams looked good on Lan. Normally VP is better on Lan but they can also win Online matches as they did many times.This match will be very close odds should be closer too. Maps will be a big factor here.

3902037,0,t3_354q7e,While they had some very noticeable issues earlier on CSGL is actually running just fine lately. Probably some major upgrading done to their infrastructure too because theyve been running without hiccup through major LANs for quite the stretch of time now.While some of their previous even somewhat recent rulings can be questioned for anyone in it for the long run and betting wisely the randomness factor of the occasional disputed ruling is simply lost in a wall of green.Whenever I benefit or lose to a CSGL ruling I basically saw it as a ddoge winloss. Something outside of my control and outside of the control of the tournamentevent organizers and even the players affected the outcome of the bet and I happened to be affected for better or worse.Ultimately CSGL is definitely worth sticking to if you bet regularly and are apt at it. The only way CSGL could be of no use to someone is if the person in question doesnt really assessanalyze games well or the riskreward well for particular games besides this perhaps sporadicspontaneous bettors will also stand to suffer as the occasional disputed draftreturn has a much higher likelihood of ruining them as opposed to someone who bets consistently and frequently.,csgobetting,cr12eu7,0,t5_2zume

3936509,0,t1_cr4zkrw,Rule  In some cases if your potential reward value is very low generally below . there is a chance you may not win something besides get your initial items back.    In addition to this rule in some cases where the odds are highly in favour of one team and you bet on the favoured team you may end up without any winnings at all. Reason being more people bet on the winning team than the total amount of items lost. In these cases potential reward values become irrelevant. It all depends on the total amount of items placed on the match. ,csgobetting,cr4zw84,1,t5_2zume

Something like swayers and trolls should not punish normal bettors in my opinion. I understand that csgolounge odds can make a difference in what kind of bet you make E.g Fnatic vs NiP  odds it would be smart betting on NiP because of those type of odds. Thats where the argument of set odds being set by csgolounge admins come into play. Also comes into play how many low lifes will try and fuck everybody over by maxbetting with multiple accounts?

If you take a look at the match history between the two teams on CSGONuts youll see that Rock is very capable of winning a BO. My odds for this match  in favor of GPlay since they have the better fraggers and are stronger for the most part against opponents of lower skill level. To put it kindly GPlay gt TrickedRock.

Liquid BO Maps Train Inferno Lineups CLG hazed reltuC Tarik jdm FNS Liquid adreN flowsicK ELiGE fugly nitr Analysis So this is actually  BOs listed as a BO on CSGOL...why admins do dis to us. Liquid more recently have been picking their game up ever since signing flowsicK to their roster really. FlowsicK is another key fragger on this team and the experience and skill is definitely there. However adreN is still under performing and needs to start stepping his game up. Inferno is generally seen as a good map for Liquid but judging on their recent performances they may not be as strong as they once were. Liquid have played well recently beating Keyd crushing Ace Gaming etc. But they definitely arent a consistent team. CLG have pretty much added jdm to their roster now. IMO its quite a step down from ptr their last AWPer. But only time will tell. These guys have been practicing hard recently and scrimmed against Keyd arguably one of the strongest teams in NA  times. I feel CLG want to win this match and with beating Keyd in scrims on Train I know it isnt much to go off but it shows theyve been practicing it they definitely seem prepared. Overall JDM has performed in the games with CLG but this will be the game to watch to see whether he is a good replacement. CLG have been practicing train in scrims quite a bit and I feel like they should definitely manage to win Train. However Liquid if they play well could definitely upset. I think that this match is likely to end . My Odds  CLG Risk  Most Likely Outcome  Tie Lounge Odds At time of writing  CLG My Bet Low CLG  If this analysis helped you and you want to see more feel free to join my Analysis Group here  New analysis every day!,csgobetting,crqbowo,0,t5_2zume

Another thing to note is that theyre wanting me to IGL as a standin and we dont have practically any practice on maps so its basically a pug.

MapsCobblestone    in favor of Fnatic  Fnatic have a  win rate here and are a extremely strong team here. Fully expect them to take this .Train    in favor of EnvyUs EnvyUs destroyed fnatic on train in late May  with Envy getting  trounds. But this was when Fnatic had centryz and Schneider. Still EnvyUs have beaten HR on it twice xtence VP once and lost to vp once. So they clearly have a halfdecent repertoire going on this map. Inferno  in favor of Fnatic  Fnatic is definitely the overall better Inferno team but this is going to be a very even map IMO.Overpass  Fnatic are a very strong overpass team while Envy have struggled on it with losses to Navi G LGB HR got  rounds loss to VP Navi and so on. They havent been able to win on it in months except for their  over hr and  over lgb. Mirage  in favor of Fnatic  Fnatics most played map with an amazing record on it and the ability to go toetotoe with it against the best Mirage team ATM in TSM. ,csgobetting,cs0papy,1,t5_2zume

Titan won cobble with their full lineup but had to play with Iorek on mirage and still put up quite a fight despite a seemingly dominant scoreline.  Anyway this is a Bo on Cache the map I would consider Titans best along with D and in VPs top .  Its gonna be a good one and if Titan play up to their potential on it and Kenny gets in form unlike yesterday Titan can easily take it.Spreadsheet,csgobetting,cs1oaxl,-1,t5_2zume
4224189,0,t3_39808x,Titan is what could be considered poor form right now as they have lost  out of their last  series as well as tying against TSM and Virtus Pro. Now these losses could be excused as they were all against T however Titan has to be able to win more of these games against other T teams to be able to keep their T status. They are able to beat T teams quite handily but just seem to be falling short against T teams right now. They did beat Flipside and Penta twice which recorded their only  wins in their past  series.Hellraisers have been in similar to Titan winning  of their past  series yet  of them were the most recent of the  matches which could be showing a sign of their form getting better. Previous to these games they lost against teams such as TSM nV Navi which are all high Tier  teams currently. Hellraisers have been in contention to join the T teams as they have shown they can beat them with dominance but just do not do it on a consistent amount. The map picked for this game is Inferno which Titan have a much higher win rate at  than HRs . They have met  times on this map with Titan taking the advantage at  the most recent match going  in favor of Titan. My Suggestion Low  Titan or Skip. These teams have faced off in  series against each other with an almost  win rate on both sides showing how even they are against each other. The only reason Im giving the extremely slight edge to Titan is due to their better performances on Inferno. Hellraisers could easily take this map against Titan and its an almost complete .My Bet Low on TitanRisk Level Very HighPM if you are interested in joining a betting group.,csgobetting,cs1qi35,1,t5_2zume

And I fail to see how my flair has anything to do with this match.

Method is inconsistent just like every other NA team but they either get stomped  or lose Win. I can see them taking one map but I cant see them taking two. Just because of their BO history. Where they have one the first map they just got stomped the second. If SKDC looks good against Tempo Storm I will surely be going high on SKDC.,csgobetting,cs6l8im,1,t5_2zume

4329043,0,t3_3aklz6,Imma go for Contributor Of The Month so lets go for first  second  I dont even know how many times Ive analyzed before in the past but lets start againSo from what Ive understood in the last few months is that everyone liked Keyd Stars a lot back when they were known as Kabum but their popularity died a lot over the last few months probably because Keyd Stars sounds nowhere as cool as Kabum gaming and because theyve been getting upset a shitload by weak ass teams. MAP BANS In no specific orderSeason  Keyd has little games played on it Keyd stars banOverpass  Favours Luminosity too much Keyd stars banNuke  Does anyone even play this shit anymore? Luminosity banMirage  Luminositys weaker map Keyds stronger map. Luminosity banPICKSThis leaves Cache Inferno and Dust . Dust s probably going to Luminosity since its their map. The reason why I dont see Keyd banning this is because they have a lot of experience on it which gives them some breathing space to plan their moves and it sure beats being slaughtered like headless chickens on  maps you rarely play. Since Keyd have a fairly good record on Inferno I could see them picking it since theyll know what they are doing on it. Luminosity also have good games on Inferno but I could see them picking Dust  over Inferno since they know what to do on it and Keyd do not not as much atleast Cache once again is just a matter of experience. Though both teams are weak on it atleast theyll know that theyre on the same level and theyll both have the same resources to work with on the spot which makes this map more of a  the way I see it. I just realised I wasted halfanhour analyzing their maps and this doesnt help in terms of betting at all. Eitherway take it the way you will.,csgobetting,csdm29a,-7,t5_2zume

4389026,0,t3_3b9hot,Lets seeMouz Doing great as lots of lowtier teams I really love watching them but that doesnt change the fact that theyre facing T teams there do in the beginning of a tournament. Besides they faced the easiest team in my opinion to start VP was really bad as they always are when they start a tournament. Envy After DH they seemed really shocked after kioshimas fathers death RIP. After some while kio started playing really good and Envy already started to recover. Still I have some doubts especially about shoxie and happy their godtier gameplay came to an end. Right now theyre trying their best to play like they played before and I really hope theyd manage to do that. VP Get ready to get surprised if VP is in the tournament. Also known as Virtus Throw or Virtus Plow they have really good players and a reeeeaaallllyy really bad one I dont want to spoil it but you can guess. G is over guys and you should change your squad like you did before. I really loved watching you but you need something new. Cloud Lol how did they manage to come here? They made the biggest mistake they could ever make by kicking Hiko out of the team. The best player in the team oh no sorry the best player in the freaking NA scene is kicked from the team while the useless  including seangares and semphis were really happy in their seats. And right now the noobest of all freakazoid is in the team and like shahzam hes playing bad and going to be kicked out. Youre just not good enough dude sorry. And Im really sorry for shroud and nothing for being in a totally worthless team while theyre playing like gods. Dignitas I always had something bad about pimp I dont know what. And kjaerbye played the worst yesterday. Still they have a god nico whos carrying them. Like mouz their first day magic was worth watching but its gonna be over soon. NiP Allu Akbar or Allu Bot? Lets say hes playing ok. How about friberg and forest? Why suddenly they started to play the worst the  titans of NiP? There are lots of questions to ask but only  matters right now Will they comeback as they always do? Id say yes just sit and watch.Titan Worthless French players. I was a big fan of Titan before their squad and play style was awesome. But after kqly got banned they sucked a lot. Especially apex. I dont want to say anything bad about using hx but there are lots of articles you can find about him using it too. I dont believe in Titan cuz kennyS plays like a silver. SK Like C I dont know how they got here. They played well against NiP still it was the starting magic and theyre going down soon.The final standings should be something like this NiP nV dig VP mouz Titan C SK,csgobetting,cskdo9y,-5,t5_2zume

4440206,0,t1_csqbve7,While each match varied in different ways that I dont feel the need to do some crazy research project on just to analyze the CLG Fnatic match stands out as a unique upset.CLG as a team really deserved better odds and they dont need to provide statistical evidence to support the fact that they won by winning successive maps off Fnatic. Why its just a best of  any shit team could potentially win that right? Well while its true we dont have a vast sample size of games to view but we do have one match on Mirage which very clearly shows Fnatic being a team capable of succumbing to CLG in a manner that is not altogether comedic the proof lies in the match itself. Before anything else the fact that the match wasnt a ridiculously close  or close OT affair lends considerable weight to the argument for CLG. A reasonably clean win kickstarted by a good T side on Mirage is what we have to look at to figure out why one can reason CLG truly deserved better odds.In that brutal Bo map all one needs to do is look closer at the game which was played the rounds which were won and how these rounds played out. Fnatic looked genuinely lost when they were unable to openly outskill CLG and had to play rounds with the mandisadvantage. Even in rounds with an advantage Fnatic uncharacteristically let things slip away from them at times in ways that people would have expected CLG to such as that v Olof clutched. Fnatic being the team that is normally seen casually and effortlessly running over Tier  competitors like theyve ascended CS godhood this is very bad for their record of consistency which for the most part is almost untarnished by losses to teams which are significantly inferior on paper and based on past performances.In order to really justify  odds the match would have had to be a nobrainer to analyze where Fnatic did nearly everything correctly and CLG just happened to BS them in a hundred different ways over the course of the match. A  odds match is supposed to indicate a match where barring all unpredictable and absurd anomalies like someone getting a jumping oneshot kill collat with a deag as the enemy team walks up ramp the favoured team should convincingly win the match. Anything less than a  at most if the favoured team started on the unfavoured side and I would really question how someone could justify anything over  for a team. While CS is a very dynamic game and sometimes shit happens odds tend to fall in a grey area with a margin of error that extends either way due to unpredictable things like jumping shots bombphysics bugs grenade glitches etc. The moment you really believe that a team has a greater than  chance at winning a match and a Bo no less youre basically stating that the other team doesnt have a chance in hell unless some of the biggest plays come from them coupled with some of the most ridiculously detrimental instances of RNG coming about to set back the favoured team. Nothing of the sort came up in abundance to lend CLG a significant helping hand. In fact they committed some rather significant mistakes such as losing that previously mentioned v clutch vs Olof. To win despite a lack of favourable RNG and some elementary mistakes to gift your opponent rounds just doesnt speak to the  odds CSGL had based on bets made.While theyre not always the best place to look for odds esportsbets odds or whatever HLTV has posted along with their community vote are a good starting point for trying to discern odds. This is practically indisputable fact as the bookies behind those odds make the odds so as to be as enticing as possible for the prospective bettor while being as close to realistically plausible odds that the house comes out with profit regardless of the outcome due to the rake and appropriate amount of bets made on one or both sides. With poorly assessed matches giving unrealistic odds for a gambling site like esportsbets people making EV bets on the teams they have incorrectly assessed will gradually turn the numbers against the house as these gambling sites unlike CSGL do not pay their users exclusively from the losses of other users.EDIT Just for further context and info behind my reasoning a good example of a match which if I recall didnt have a CSGL bet added for good reason was a match on Nuke between formerDignitas now TSM playing against a Japanese team attending ESWC. Dignitas started T side and managed to lose  rounds to their opponents Cipangu. A  score losing the half on Nuke is generally seen as a fine T side in competitive play but for the underdog team even  rounds on the favoured side of Nuke should be seen as somewhat a feat given Dignitas previous reputation on the map. What truly sealed the deal for that match however and makes me think its a solid example of a true  or worse match where realistic odds were really  or worse against the underdogs was the fact that once Dignitas hit CT side while their opponents understood enough about CSGOs basics and had good enough aim to lock down a subpar  round CT side they had simply nothing to show on their T side that would begin to evoke the slightest worry out of Dignitas. End result was a  where Cipangu didnt really so much as even test Dignitas come halftime something they would absolutely have to do to warrant having a reasonable chance at winning the map given their already less than perfect CT side. I truly believe had that match been played repeatedly upwards of  times the only wins Cipangu would have had were ones where some extraordinarily unlikely and random stuff happened in order to give them key rounds on both halves as well as both pistols. Even then scoring a big  out of  rounds played on T side its a stretch to imagine any such team winning Nuke purely on randomness giving them rounds against a topcalibre team such as the nowTSM lineup of Dignitas for ESWC last year.,csgobetting,csqdf4l,3,t5_2zume

4487316,0,t3_3chlvu,The map is Dust  and VP is known to veto this map a lot. The thing is they DEFINITELY have been practicing this map. A couple months ago everyone always bet against VP when the map was D but then randomly they came out of nowhere and destroyed this same team on this map. Ever since then VP have actually been pretty dominant on D. People always say oh its D bet against VP cause they suck on it but if you look at csgonuts they have won a majority of their D games after the TSM vs VP incident. I recommend watching how TSM plays against HR and then base your bet on that. If TSM performs poorly I recommend a bet on VP. If TSM is dominant against HR watch how VP plays against Fnatic. You as betters have the opportunity to watch how each team performs today before betting on this match. Im not saying just because they win you should bet on that team because sometimes thats not the case. Im just saying itll help. If the odds favor TSM heavily I think going low on VP is still a good idea.   My Odds  favoring TSM   Risk High   My Spreadsheet  ,csgobetting,cswaepv,1,t5_2zume

4557116,0,t3_3dgxan,Here is the giveaway in question Results from Giveaway Results from Giveaway Screenshots from a conversation between Dot and DMGGEDIT So there were   BS AWP Asiimovs given to udotwjm. He gave away  of them which leave the discrepancy that uDeliciousMilkGG is talking about. I dont have any proof as to whether or not DMGG actually traded Dot the Asiimovs but seeing that he gave away  of them it is almost certain that they were in Dots possession. That then leaves the question What happened to the other  ? DMGG claims to have had  of them taken but I count ... Either way if what he says is true then its obviously a very serious situation. Now we wait for Dot to respond to the matter.The skins were given to moderator udotwjm anonymously to be distributed to winners in the sub reddit.

The same Titan that thought it was a good idea to not veto Cobblestone against SK the one map that SK plays exceptionally well on.VP usually pick their vetos and maps pretty well so Im guessing they have a plan against NaVi on Overpass.

4597886,0,t3_3dzr61,Copied from my Facebook Analysis page Newish to analysis! Feel free to PM me for linkeLevate vs Quintic BO eLevate This is going to be the second time that this roster is going to be playing in an official match with the only other match being against CLG and they actually did pretty well for a brand new team. The team is full of extremely talented players who all know how to aim pretty well but they lack that communication which was evident through their game against CLG. Taking a game pretty convincingly shows that the team does have a great amount of potential and over time we could see eLevate taking games against many of the Top  NA teams.Quintic The lesser known of the two teams Quintic actually is not a bad team and was able to do considerably well in their NA CSGO Main league at a record of . Keep into consideration though that these are lower tier teams and a team like eLevate even with the new roster should be able to achieve a similar if not better record. In many of their recent matches Quintic has been showing a lot more control whenever they are on T side and are able to pick up rounds relatively easily. Quintic does appear to have many more scrims than eLevate does and they appear to be focusing on inferno the most. While many of the scrims do appear to be tieslosses it shouldnt be taken too much into consideration as they could be trying out new strategies. Overall Just out of pure skill I would have to give a advantage to eLevate at  because of the sheer amount of talent that is available in this roster. However Quintic shouldnt be taken out of the situation completely as they have been a team for much longer which implies better communication and they arent a bad team in terms of their tier. Adding onto the fact that this is a BO we arent  sure what either team could bring to the game and because of the current odds I would suggest a smallICB on Quintic.tldr I really recommend you read the postCHOICE QuinticRISK HighBet SmallICB,csgobetting,cta5jwu,8,t5_2zume

4639801,0,t3_3eirxr,CLG vs LiquidThis matchup is a pretty classic North American showdown between the  contenders for second place in NA. I can only assume the odds are in favour of CLG because they brought C to overtime and nearly caught them on tilt. If you read my C vs. Mouz analysis you will realize the only reason CLG came close to taking Cache off C is through their unpredictability without FNS. Cs counterstrat style of play showed weakness today but CLG will NOT fair the same against Liquid. Adren will have planned executions in mind for tomorrow and will probably run basic setups on the CT side to catch all possible attacks from CLG. Without FNS to guide the team I dont see CLG making it much farther as picking and rolling will only get them so far.ConclusionPersonal odds My bet  on Liquid depending on where the odds landRecommended play the odds here and bet low on the underdogRisk factor   BO between  of the top NA teamsMy July spreadsheet w link to free steam group,csgobetting,ctfex6n,1,t5_2zume

I didnt confirm via mail though. After a short discussion with a friend I agreed that I should simply trade all of it for an ugly Gut Knife Vanilla and be over with it. I went to csgolounge found a guy sent him a trade offer with all Ive got and also added him on steam. He did not respond he was not there.And so I decided to rage deposit on one of those jackpot sites.I place literally everything again I was left with just my year coin. I placed it on a relatively small pot where Id have a chance. But it got filled up and I missed it. It placed my deposit for the next pot where a guy then sniped all of us with .I fucking won .. I couldnt believe it I felt like I was disillusioning but I did win a  pot. It has many shit skins but a couple nice knives etc. so  yeah. Saying this was the last thing I would have expected losing the bet yesterday was probably the best thing that I could have asked for. Otherwise I wouldnt have placed that rage deposit obviously.

4736921,0,t1_ctr1xgj,Renegades and Immunity have both played at the international level so we at least have two PIm not entirely sure what you mean by making it past qualifiers. For Cologne  they allocated two spots to the entire AsianOceanic region. Australian teams took stnd in the qualifiers and took both spots. Australia successfully took all qualification opportunities provided. NA I believe is offered more opportunities and you have a vastly larger scene overall.As for Kinguin they did  VP but thats can easily be argued that it was VP performing poorly. The only match of theirs vs an NA team was a  loss to Cloud so its hard to say how theyd stack up overall.,csgobetting,ctrmrqv,1,t5_2zume

Going into this in a previous interview their IGL said that this was important to them and that they would be taking this seriously which is a good start i guess?. CLGAfter settling back home from the CEVO season  finals in which they sadly did under perform quite a bit. They have been looking fairly shakey to say the least although i really dont think SK should be favored over them here they have Tarik who can carry and probably will.My odds  CLG or  CLGMy bet Depends on Odds but most likely Low on SK for that upset potential.,csgobetting,cts6tvf,2,t5_2zume

Lunatik has been able to beat most teams under invite except for SKDC and put up a decent fight against the better invite teams.Woosah are an okay low level premier team. They lost  to Tempo ed MostlyHarmless and lost  to flyingv. Woosah is occasionally able to beat some decent teams but other times play terrible.Overall Lunatik are the better team because they are a low level invite team and have been playing better against other teams. Woosah sometimes has good games though but I put the odds for this game at  for Lunatik and going low on Lunatik should be safe especially since this is a BO.

Reason is able to beat most tier three teams they face even though they struggle to beat tier two teams Evolution has been playing a bit inconsistently as a high level tier three team losing   and  to DampG ed CAZ convincingly ed Ux lost  to Neophyte and ed Infused and Exanimo. Evolution seems to rely on Smple to carry them and if he plays badly it will be really hard for them to win this match.Head to head Reason ed Evolution  and . That was Evolutions first match though when they had less team chemistry. Overall Reason is slightly the better team as they have been better head to head with Evolution. Other than that both these teams are in the same tier and have been playing similarly against other teams. I give Reason  odds but you should honestly skip as these odds are not too good and will most likely end in a tie.The Spreadsheet  You can PM me if you would like a direct invite to the steam group by either me linking the steam group or you linking your steam profile.

I followed idzuo all throughout the balkan tourney and Ik how well they usually play even though they dont have much current cs history ik of they started in .. Also the prize pool for that tourney was incredibly low so sure why not? There was also alot of pleasantry and complimentsfamiliarity with the girls. Also this game appeared on lounge right after an account with no previous posts made a thread about why cant we bet on girls matches so yeah I think there is plenty of evidence to claim a throw. Especially after they came back from the loser bracket of the tourney to play well for the rest of it. Like magic eh joelz?

Although nexus is the overdog here it will be close because swarm beat nexus  in a cs select only a week or so ago. This prize pool like cs select isnt very large and once again they could easily not try. In conclusion Nexus has the upper hand here. If they try they will win. So I would go small on them  because this is a medhigh rick game. You can check out my spreadsheet on my journey from  to   or my YouTube Channel ,csgobetting,cui4hb7,-3,t5_2zume

4958333,0,t1_cujj1fg,I havent had a chance to watch too much navi but definitely VP. Neos awp isnt as big a liability any more but at least judging from the past few matches for VP it was mainly guys like snax and Pasha who had the crucial frags. Not necessarily top fragging or carrying all the time but the trades were made lurks were done and important stops were made. Compared to that neo just tends to miss one or two important shots and tends to fade away when rest of team isnt on fire at the same time or is up against a clearly better awper. Yesterday I was shocked to even see Pasha taking awp for a round or two.I might be underestimating Edward but Im just suggesting low for VP due to the momentum they have and the odds. For navi if they can consistently give guardian the awp they will be able to land their executes. Im just concerned that it may not happen.,csgobetting,cujjdf0,1,t5_2zume

5000793,1,t3_3jeu7n,This is a best of  between NaVi and Dignitas. This is part of PGL Season  and is the EU Last Chance upper semifinal. This means that this is their final opportunity to go to the PGL offline finals. This match should be pretty important for both teams as if they lose this bracket theyre outIm not exactly sure how these last chance matches work didnt really say on PGL website. If someone can clarify thatd be nice. These  teams have played each other before. The last they played each other was in the end of July. In those matches however NaVi was able to beat Dignitas in every match they faced against them besides once in April. Due to the date in which these matches were played I will not be posting them. If you would like to look at them click hereFrom those previous matches you can see that NaVi was able to handle Dignitas quite easily. There werent many close games then again these games were a while ago. Natus VincereNatus Vincere more commonly known as NaVi is a Tier  team globally and arguably a pretty good team. The team is filled with good players who can get things done. Players like flamie or GuardiaN can really impact the game. GuardiaN is just a great AWPer in general and can get some pretty nice shots. NaVi has looked a little on and off recently. They were able to defeat both Virtus Pro and TSM a couple days ago in a reasonable fashion but failed to take  map of them when they played again. Even though they lost those TSM and Virtus Pro are looking extremely solid right now so Im not that surprised. But that doesnt mean NaVi cant take  map off of them. NaVi has a pretty large map pool. Theyre able to play pretty much all the maps besides for Cache which theyve played  times and have a win rate of about . I would say their best map is probably Overpass as its a map their consistently able to win.  Counter Pit League  Dust TSM  NaVi | Overpass TSM  NaVi PGL Season S  Inferno VP  NaVi | Train VP  | Overpass VP  NaVi PGL Season   Mirage TSM  NaVi | Dust NaVi  TSM | Overpass NaVi  TSMThe results above show that NaVi has been doing eh recently. They werent able to take a single map off of NaVi or VP when they were previously able to do so. It couldve been one of NaVis off days. VP and TSM have been looking solid recently so that could contribute. NaVi does seem to not like Cache at all as they pretty much veto it all the time.              DignitasDignitas is a pretty high tier  team. They can be extremely deadly when on form. They have some really nice players like Nico or Pimp. Dignitas is the team who also has a pretty great CT side. They played against CPH Wolves a few days ago and were down  and managed to come back and won in overtime . Dignitas has the capability of being pretty much any tier  team and probably some lower tier  teams. Dignitas has a pretty big map pool but their best maps are Mirage or Cobblestone they just seem to do really well on those maps. Dignitas did do a pretty nice comeback against CPH Wolves when they were down . That doesnt mean that Dignitas isnt good at other maps. All their other maps have a similar win rate.   CEVO Pro League S  Train Titan  Dignitas | Cobble Titan  Dignitas GameAgents League  Overpass Property  Dignitas | Train Dignitas  Property PGL Season   Mirage mouz  Dignitas | Train Dignitas  mouz | Dust mouz  Dignitas | Overpass mouz  DignitasFrom the results above you can see that they arent looking too hot. They did lose against Titan and got a map taken off by Property but Dignitas didnt have Nico and Property did has twist. The match we should really be looking at is the mouz game. They were only able to get  map off of mouz and they werent really close games. I wouldve expected a  score with a lot of  scores which we didnt see.ConclusionThe current odds of this game as Im posting this are  NaVi. I personally think Dignitas deserves more than . The recent results may not show it but I think Dignitas has potential to beat NaVi. NaVi hasnt been looking super hot in these past  matches but so hasnt Dignitas. Its also a best of  which also helps the underdog. Even with those factors Im still going to have to go with NaVi.  My odds   NaVi My bet Low NaVi Risk HighYou can check out my spreadsheet hereI have recently created a betting group! If you would like to join message me for information or click on the spreadsheet!

5044226,0,t3_3k0tqx,When these teams play each other it tends to be very  sided either way w HR taking  matches.  We are seeing scorelines like  twice  and .  This is showing some huge inconsistency in when these teams play. Recently HR has seemed to break their inconsistent nature. Theyve won all  of their most recent games even beating Navi  who allthough struggling are still a notable team.  The other opponents are teams I would say HR should have beat.  Weaker lowertier teams who SHOULD have lost.Thats what I would call DampG a team HR SHOULD beat. They have put up sad results lately losing to SK Gaming a team HR recently beat twice.  Their only notable recent win is against Epsilon .Overall this game should probably be skipped.  The teams have gone almost  against each other and every game has been very  sided.  In my opinion anything can happen.  HR IS the better and team and SHOULD win but itll depend on how they show up which I cannot predict.  This seems like an obvious stupid thing to say but if you know anything about HR youll understand.Depending on how the odds get  right now this looks fairly good for a small underdog bet if you have the bank for it.  My odds for the match are  simply because HR has been doing well recently and DampG has been mediocre at best. Im keeping it to  since their games have gone  to HR and DampG definitely has the potential to upset here.  PLEASE let me know what you think of this analysis. Ive begun doing them in hopes that writing out my betting plans will improve them by letting me see flaws and here criticism to my points.

The only Tier  NA team.Theyre amazing at CS you cant deny it. Especially for their situation. Is it a let down to see them lose? Of course it is. But its not like theyre going . Theyre putting up a fight against amazing teams like EnvyUs who were in the finals of the previous major.They shouldve won that NiP game though.

5109638,0,t3_3kyjer,EnVyUs vs NiP AnalysisSo this is also another game with some high tier games. FACEIT is such a great tournament for these P. This is pretty much one of the highest tournaments youll get out here. We have EnVyUs a team which is a powerhouse. Though they havent showned it recently. You also have NiP a team that is coming back from theyre slump. This is going to be an interesting match to watch for sure. Alright so this is Stage  of the FACEIT League of . Teams can qualify from this stage to head on to the LAN Finals of FACEIT where both teams will definitely want to go. This match is part of the EU Division so teams technically have a better chance of getting to the LAN as more teams are being drafted from this division to go to the LAN. Teams should definitely be trying to their full capacities here.These teams played quite recently during Dubai. EnVy really seemed like they were underperforming. They had a really close game against an offform C then almost getting ed by VP. They later played NiP who did extremely well against nV. nV was able to beat them on Dust and Inferno and win the series . It mustve been a pretty massive confidence boost for NiP as they havent won one of those matches for a long while. Inferno is one of nVs best maps so it was a pretty accomplishing victory. They had a pretty close game on D though. NiP seemed to do pretty well on that map all throughout the tournament so it wasnt too surprising. I honestly expected nV to get at least  map off of NiP. EnVyUsEnVyUs is probably the best french team out there. Theyre a powerhouse and managed to make a massive appearance during IEM Gamescon. They literally came in and won the tournament. They then entered Cologne and managed to reach the finals. It was their first ever major and they reached the finals only to be shut down by fnatic. Overall theyre lineup is really solid with the addition of kennyS and apEX theyve been doing quite well with the team.nVs team consists of kennyS apEX NBK Happy and kioshima. They recently got a roster change which has been extremely beneficial. It took them out of their slump and they did incredibly well with it. They have some really nice players like kennyS and apEX the  additions from Titan. NBK can also be quite good. Especially with the scout. KennyS also can be insane with the AWP. Though he hasnt been doing the absolute best in the games.nV has been kinda offform. They just didnt seem to play well during Dubai. They entered the tournament playing Cloud and managed to take the map. It was  on Cobble so it was decent. Then they played VP later that day and got demolished. The first half was  and they managed to get  rounds before VP finally closed it out. VP was playing really well that tournament but they shouldve been able to get at least  round during the first half. They then lost the tournament after facing NiP in which NiP pretty much beat them really convincingly. That mustve gave them a confidence boost. This wasnt really nV like behavior.NiPNiP is a team that has recently been in a slump. They look like theyre coming out of it though. Their performance during Dubai mustve really been a nice confidence boost for them. The team used to be one of the best but just really started to fall. Im glad to see them coming back though.NiPs roster consists of GeTRiGhT allu xist frest and friberg. This roster can be really deadly when on form. I think they just needed a confidence boost to start to get out of their slump. If you look at their twitters theyre really proud of their performance during Dubai. They all did quite well during Dubai especially GR and frest. They were getting the shots they needed and were just winning. The team is filled with a bunch of CS veterans like frest. Theyve been playing for a while so they definitely have experience.NiP did better during Dubai than they did for a while. They didnt have the best Cologne performance in which they had shaky results against CLG and ultimately feel to TSM with a score of . I feel like all they needed was a confidence boost which they got during Dubai. Speaking of Dubai they did pretty well there. They were able to have pretty good results though GR was doing some major damage. Frest was also doing really well during the tournament. NiP was able to first beat C in OT which was a nice win for them though they lost to VP before that. They then proceeded to beat nV which was a really nice win for them. They were able to beat them on D and Infernoargueably nVs best map. They managed to even take a map off of TSM before finally dropping out of the tournament. They definitely are getting out. Well see if this match reassures that.MapSo the map has already been decided. The map is Train. This is a best of  so it makes it a whole lot more risky. Train is a pretty CT sided map so the team that gets the knife round can really get an advantage in this game if they play it correctly. NiP is also a team that has a nice win percentage on pistol rounds. This can definitely come into play due to the impact of the pistol round on this map. The winner of the pistol round should be able to take  rounds initially which is quite helpful as this map is CT sided. They can easily gain a lead from the pistol round if they win it. NiP has a  winrate on Train while nV has a  win rate after only playing  matches on it. NiP was almost able to beat VP on it  one of VPs best maps while nV was also able to beat VP  on the map. The other time nV played it was against mouz which they lost .ConclusionOverall I think NiP will be able to take this. Especially with the experience on this map as well as the results to help back them up. They seem to be getting back on track which is good. This match can really help reassure that they are getting back. EnVy hasnt been looking super hot recently so this could come into factor here. This is just a really risky match that could go either way. I think the initial pistol round and knife round will come into a big factor here. I think if players like GR and frest are able to play like they did at Dubai they could very well win this. My Odds  NiP My Prediction NiP  My Advice Play the odds if NiP goes above  low nV.

5123319,0,t1_cv3jsq4,Well seeing as they just got  rounds in a row looks like I was right.Youre talking out of your ass and because the team you bet on got out played and off to a bad start that automatically makes them throwing.Get over it and yourself.Its a fcking  BO for gods sake. It was even pointed out that this game was vitally important for both teams so both would be putting their best players forward. Portugal opted for only  G.Kinguin player. The smart bet wouldve been to play the odds even if you lose.Honestly as much as Id hate to see people who bet on Portugal to lose their skins I hope Romania takes it so you learn a lesson.Just because you bet on the better team and the better team lost doesnt mean that they threw the match.Even Fnatic can and has lost lose games.The fact that you went straight to a  after a bad start tells me that you didnt bet low like you claim.

As the match draws closer and closer I switched between KeyD and LG like a million times before I finally just went with my gut and stuck with LG when they had  against .  The score was  tied up and the last map was Cobblestone. I remember LG was in an ECO against LG KeyD final round I forgot if it was OT or not  all I remember was this match was the one that won the game for me.

5227489,0,t1_cvfr080,The reason gambling is  is because someone under ish couldnt possibly comprehend the value of money and where it comes from and even then it takes at least a year or two of working your ass off to realize how much time you have to waste away at work just to buy that  karambit you bet on VP last night.Theres also the fact that children are easier to influence and corrupt. Lets say you bet your  karambit you spent your moms money on VP and they won! Wow! You won another  karambit!That just taught you that you can make  as simple as throwing money into a gamble and winning. Youll never learn the true importance of time or the true value of money with things like gambling brain washing you.Thats why we care. I dont mind gambling against a  year old because it means Ive got the tactical advantage of wisdom and experience over them therefore Im more likely to win their money but I do mind that  year olds future being fucked up over a video game and some poor parenting.Ask your parents why you shouldnt gamble explain what you do in your free time.

Games where Kenny didnt go off typically didnt have good scorelines for Titan. Scream is a good player but hes not a single hand hypercarry. However it seems that they are more into a team oriented style so they arent going to be beat as hard as often if one player does poorly or if one doesnt go off hard enough.Not a downgrade.

5268895,1,t3_3n3k69,Liquid vs VPBOCSGO Lounge Link VP have been looking fairly solid. They always beat tier two teams convincingly and have been able to compete with some of the best teams in the world. Although they lost a map in a BO to Orbit they have not lost a BO to a tier two team in a long time. Liquid have been playing well in NA as Hiko has been able to set the roles of the team. Their games against Renegades were impressive but their  loss against Mous proves they still dont have what it takes to compete with tier one teams in BOs. Although Liquid took maps off Navi and Fnatic in BOs before they have never been able to beat one in a BO. I give VP  odds and going medium on them should be safe. The Spreadsheet  You can PM me if you would like a direct invite to the steam group by either me linking the steam group or you linking your steam profile. If there is more than one stand in on a team that is announced after I analyse always skip the bet. Before upvote or downvote please write in a reply why you are doing so so I can improve my analysis for the benefit of everyone.

5377936,0,t1_cvz2x41,My concern with that is what was the point of trying him out if you didnt have the intention of replacing someone? If he did turn out to be a good player and lets be honest.... he WAS going to be the best player on that team then they would have moved to find a spot for him on the team. And at that point who do they replace? Obviously not Dumore Stanislaw or Scrunk..... so that leaves Drawsoul and invert. And at that point if they were to remove Drawsoul then that would allow them to have complete control of the roster due to ESEAs  rule. Its basically making a cunning power play to gain control of ths of the team so they could take it over completely. I know it doesnt sound like people would do this and maybe in the end dumore wouldnt have. But from the perspective of the team leader and its longest member draek it would seem like an attempt to take over his team. ,csgobetting,cvz3bii,1,t5_2zume

Its betting you will never have  winrate. And with underdog betting losing is a big part of the strategy. Its natural.After you fully understand that you will lose very often you should get the idea that you must minimize your losses. And thats why you skip when not sure and bet low on risky matches. Never bet skins that you are afraid to lose. Even assume you will lose. Think how would you feel if you lost those skins. If you would feel angry or sad because you lost a lot it means you should bet smaller.I have  winrate. So what if I lose low and win high. I got x my inventory in the last month from  to .

5535554,0,t3_3qu3vs,Fnatic vs nVform of both teamsFnatic were very shaky vs C almost every gun rounds where C didnt save was so close but fnatic won them all the time. Look at the kills its like score was  or so and not  that how much closer that was. And Overpass C pretty much throwed away. They got pretty good ct and then start to lose round by round on nd half and most of their mistakes. Then finally after pause they got themselves together and got the lead just lo make even more mistakes in all the next rounds.So i cant see it as good Fnatic win. And C previous form with shroud almost afk in this bo makes it even more of a puny win.nV on the other hand beasted on mirage vs NaVi which i didnt expect that much tho taking both pistols obviously helped navi got like zero economy through the whole of the map. And win over dignitas isnt something to talk about coz i think it isnt hardcore porn subreddit. map vetooverpass for nV even tho fnatic shaky on it there isnt any reason for nV to change their standard ban they dont play this map and penta winning vs them there as well as mouz getting close to that some days ago in esea online is a living proof.cache for fnatic i think its a weakest map for them at the moment and one of the better for nV no reason to leave it in pool.Pick for nV should be mirage fnatic sure still a world class team on mirage but Frenches way way better here and only on cache theyd get even better odds to win.  to nV on mirage.For fnatic pick have to be Train even tho nV shit all over them on train twice in recent bo onlines i dont think that fnatic have any other choice but to pick train. This is an only map where fnatic should be favorites... on paper. So its  to fnatic but with their recent perfomance they can be stomped as hard as it was in online matches.So decider is either inferno nV for my money cobble nV id say or dustmore ish one just coz its dust.And i hope it goes to inferno because its a classic matchup and well see if fnatic fallen all the way down or it was just a fluke vs Luminosity.Overall my odds here is  nV.BetIt depends i dont think that odds will shift any more than to  for nV. So its a tough choice its really hard for me to see how fnatic will win even  but odds for nV kinda bad even tho my odds just  less than lounge ones i wouldnt bet on  either since there isnt any profitable difference between my odds and those which on lounge.So its a choice either bet on fnatic and hope for miracleand with current fnatics form it have to be one or bet on nV despite bad odds. Loselose choice as for me and i think thats why im gonna skip this one but my sticker in pickem goes on nV obviously. And if you decide to bet i think its a low fantic or med nV but still my advice will be Skip.If you want you may check my spreadsheet There is a link to my group as well free to join where i post lot more than on reddit and doing frequent giveaways as well.

My mistake was relying on couple valuable skins which I tried to use to gain an actual betting inventory so those two upsets rekt me. Im also super into the European CS scene and with betting the matches get all that much more intense to watch..

5559131,0,t3_3r64ze,Hello I will make it brief and smple .    My inventory is more or like my ak stattrack elite build and some  ct skins one cartel in returns so it is not over .    Why would i want to get into betting? I started to follow the scene like a year ago just been following my teams. In my case i got lucky when i startedd betting with low quality skins i rose my inventory from cents to   i was glad i had some nice skins but then i last them all gave some to friends since i was lucky and lost some on bets that was like  months ago that is my experience. Why would i like to start now well i am more mature smarter i can make better bets but i dont have the aportunity to kck start . I want another chance and i wanna know how far can i go now. Maybe i can start something big with my winnings. Just some thoughts. So pick me. ,csgobetting,cwm5t73,1,t5_2zume

And yes this subreddit is for betting and for predictions and stuff but we do know that this sub is still a community of people who are interested in the CSGO Scene. Now yes I do think this thread should be posted on the CSGO Subreddit but not everything gets discussed from down there. I also think that many people here ARE WILLING to have  threads that are just discussing the teams itself WITH A PROPER MANNER AND NO ABUSIVE BASHING in it. If this thread couldve been done better with the formatting and such I think this couldve been a discussion flair. First of all hes not spamming second hes not begging for skins third hes not crying about his lost skins fourth hes not advertising so I dont really know whats wrong with the post excluding the fact that it IS poorly made.No ones bashing anyone at allwell me because I bashed youkinda The dude simply wanted to discuss Cs form all in all.,csgobetting,cwnx01v,1,t5_2zume

5580984,1,t3_3rk575,Penta vs EnvyusBOCSGO Lounge Link Envyus After their major win Envyus are probably the best team in the world. At the major Envyus were able to beat Navi G and Fnatic who are all good teams. Online Envyus had a convincing win against HR but their  loss against NIP on cobble really shows that they can lose a BO like any other team. Envyus man for man are also the best team in the world as Apex is one of the nuttiest entry fraggers in the world Happy is one of the best IGLs rifler and lurker in the world and Kenny is the second best awper in the world. Penta Penta are one of the most inconsistent tier two teams. They have dominated VP Navi and Envyus in BOs went  with Fnatic and ed HR but often gets slammed by tier one teams and get less than  rounds. A fun fact is that Penta has performed much better than Mous in majors even though Mous individually is better than the old Penta.Head To Head Envyus is the best team in the world while Penta is a mediocre tier two team. Envyus historically has been domolishing Penta but they somehow lost  to them. Although Overpass is certainly not the best map for the french men a losss is still a loss. Map Format There would be no way that Penta would win a BO against Envyus but Pentas inconsistencies are really scaring me away from betting on Envyus. Final Thoughts Envyus on paper should not be losing more than  rounds against Penta especially as they are one of the best mirage teams in the world. Penta has just been upsetting too many tier one teams for me to place a med bet on Envyus though so I will be skipping this. I give Envyus  odds and you can put  of your inventory on them or skip.

5594111,0,t3_3rje4w,LG are known as a LAN team and have shown that last week at Cluj surprising everyone with their results. They have shown what they are capable of and how good they can be. Cold is a beast Fallen is a beast they have a lot of talent and firepower but the question is if they can carry that good form they were showing at Cluj here? Their recent online results say no but again LG usually show up at LANs even these smaller ones and try pretty hard to have a good showing. But they have also shown a bit of fatigue after all their travelling problems. Their online results this past week havent been the best and its only been a few days since they got back home for them to be packing their bags and travelling again. LG seem to do their best when they have a solid amount of prep time i.e. bootcamps and such before going into LANs but having just come from one I feel they have a good idea of what they want to do and what their opponent will want to do.Titan has had some struggles after the roster swaps. They were hyped a bit and had some decent matches early on but slowly they started to fall apart. They had a decent start at Cluj but royally choked in the best of  against NIP and once again fell out of the group stage. Despite all that you cannot deny that Titan have a lot of fragging ability on their team they just seem to have trouble making use of it.Based on their performances last week at Cluj and the venue they will be playing at NA Im rating this match at around  in favor of Titan but will be placing a LOW bet on LG. I feel they are pumped from their performance at Cluj and will want to show it wasnt just a fluke.GL and HF everyone!Restarting my betting career at  and trying to reach .

5641546,0,t3_3sbmnt,VP vs GVETOBANSG bans Train G might be decent on train but theyd have to have some serious balls to leave VPs best map in the poolVP bans Dust VP have never been good on Dust as they tend to rely more on reading their opponents and reacting to their strategies something which is impossible on DustG bans Overpass They rarely play it and havent won on it in forever.VP bans Cache G has looked insane on Cache recently and while VP has looked okay on it I dont think theyd like to risk leaving it in the pool.PICKSG picks Inferno When G was Kinguin they upset a lot of T teams on Inferno behind an incredibly strong T side. Theyve fallen off a bit since then but their fight against EnVyUs at Cluj points to them still being able to play well on it.VP picks Mirage VP has always been one of the worlds best Mirage teams. They control mid very well both as Ts and CTs which makes playing the map much much easier. Decider map is CobblestoneMapsInferno This is a must win for G. I dont see them having a chance to beat VP on Mirage so giving up the first map is almost certainly a death sentence. If they can get back to the Kinguin of old the the team that would regularly pull of  T halves they should have this in the bag. VP seems a little out of place on Inferno save for Pasha and SNax who look alright.Mirage Mirage has always been VPs stomping ground. They hold A site very well against smoke takes as CTs and are able to execute onto sites very well as Ts. G has looked halfdecent on  Mirage recently but nowhere near the level of VP.Cobblestone Neither team is fantastic on Cobblestone but I think that VP will have a better chance at taking this. VP tend to have some problems with Cobble when its a Bo or the first game in a series. If its going to be the decider map I see no problem with VP taking this one.Overall ThoughtsThis is actually a pretty important game for VP. This is part of a qualifier starladder LAN a league that they tend to take pretty seriously not to mention the  prize pool. They are by far the strongest team in their group EFrag and exOrbit are the other  teams VP has already lost to exOrbit and actually really needs to win out from here to get out of groups. They should have their big boy pants on looking to win this series and get in the win column.Heres a link to our spreadsheet for those who are interested Calling all Fanobettors!

5646705,0,t3_3sgfca,Ace vs MethodCSGO Lounge Link Ace Ace have been beating the majority of premier teams they have been facing but they are premier. I remember when they were in invite and they got crushed like A used to. Ace are and always have been a team that are full of pug gods and the majority of their players have  RWS. The players on Ace dont play full time and so they will never be a decent invite team. Even though Ace has always struggles against invite teams they have taken maps off them in the past so they deserve some respect. Method Method have always been a mediocre low level invite team. Even though they hardly ever beat good invite teams Method consistently beats premier teams and Method have some good fraggers and teamplay. Head To Head The last time these two teams played each other was five months ago and Method won a close . Map Format A BO certainly benefits Method but if Ace can  GA they will probably be taking a map.Final Thoughts Method are rightly favoured here but Ace has taken maps off teams that are better than Method in the past and they have some nutty fraggers. I give Method  odds and I wouldnt bet on them unless they get at least  odds. The Spreadsheet  You can PM me if you would like a direct invite to the steam group by either me linking the steam group or you linking your steam profile. I used to always have this disclaimer before but people complained and flamed me for having this saying it is not needed but now it is apparent they were wrong because now people have been complaining when I acted on this. I have been doing this for months if there is a standin for the game this analysis is INVALID and you have to SKIP the match.,csgobetting,cwx119q,1,t5_2zume

Im just glad that a lot of the pro teams have agreed not to use it. I was worried given that I had placed a huge bet before the update had arrived and early on the revolver played a pivotal role in helping the Chiefs get a lead. I went to sleep after Legacy won the first map so I dont know if they continued to use the revolver for Dust II.

6117679,0,t3_3zb7lb,ESC vs nEophyte ThoughtsI would consider these  teams pretty close in skill level. They both have their inconsistencies which is why I would consider this match risky to bet on. The thing about ESC is that they dont really care about D!ngIT and probably could make more money betting on nEophyte than winning the cup. Theres a trend going on where exESC usually wins when theyre underdogs or lose when theyre overdogs which is something you should keep in mind. Ill probably be betting on the underdog in this match as I think its the best option when you look at how these teams play. I know this isnt really an analysis but these are just my thoughts for this match. This is an extremely risky match considering how these teams are so be cautious when betting.

6271829,0,t3_41f661,I know the past results favor F but I feel like EFrag has been playing alot better lately. Plus you have to keep in mind those HHs were from  months ago. EFrag recently won the IEM Katowice  EU Qualifier  didnt drop a map and looked just dominating.  Now they get to use Dreamer instead of PNshr upgrade and their original squad.  Another reason im favoring EFrag in this is because of the league.  EFrag will be trying their hardest to win one of their last  games to solidify their spot for the LAN. Also F are  with their win being a default win from EZskins forfeiting the league. And their loss was to Vexed last week and tbh it was a blowout.  F need to win all  of their remaining games just to tie for the chance of the LAN.  Also my personal opinion this is one of the lans that allows EFrag to compete with their full squad due to Dreamers VAC and they were at last years LAN that just makes me feel that they try extra hard to qualify so Dreamer can go to a lan with them.All that being said this is a bo so EFrag only needs to win  map to tie and keep our skins safe My Odds  EFragI will be betting accordingly if EFrag goes above  I will most likely skip. Otherwise  on EFragBtw heres the link to the group bracket ,csgobetting,cz2jbti,3,t5_2zume

6294355,0,t3_41tycc,Hey yall CamT here with another bet prediction!ampnbspNostalgieampNBSPThere is not too much information that can be provided about this lineup as it is a constantlychanging lineup consisting of highup EuropeanCIS players. The only match that these players have player together as a team recently is against Flipsid Tactics in which they lost  but held their own with a strong performance losing maps Overpass and Train  and  consecutively. Glave is a very talented IGL and with pimp ex. Dignitas and Cadian they should be a force to be reckoned with in the matchupampnbspampnbspEpsilonampnbspEpsilon a team consisting of a relatively solid group of spanish onliners havent been too active in official matches lately. Theyve been a lineup for several months but throughout their journey as a team they have not impressed. They failed to make a significant venture into the ESL Barcelona LAN event falling to a a spanish mix team and more recently in other official matches losing to Team YP  and London Conspiracy . These results show that they arent a strong competitor in comparison to the opposing lineup.ampnbspConclusionThe Nostalgie lineup in comparison to Epsilon has much stronger individual talent and the result of this match will be dependent on the chemistry between the players of Nostalgie. The only way I see them losing this match to Pepsi is if there is a breakdown of communication and individuals dont perform. A medium bet on Nostalgie should be safe.ampnbspCSGL odds  NostalgieMy odds  NostalgieRecommended bet Med NostalgieMy bet  Med NostalgieampnbspHere is a link to my Spreadsheet which is open to the public for  more days as a free trial.

It has a similar backstory to yours but instead of my first case open it was my first market purchase. i had just discovered that trading cards can be sold and i excitedly sold ALL OF MINE for about . which i spent only on CSGO skins as i had none expect some sand dunes that i got as drops from my first  hours of play. At that point i knew how to use one guy the UMP. So i bought what i thought was a super nice skin for it a stattrak labyrinth for about .. After that i got an Mas boreal forest and AWP safari mesh and an AK predator and called my inventory awesome for about  weeks. The other three i upgraded as soon as i played with a friend who had and still has about a  inventory and realized how nice it got but the labyrinth is still there from before i was even ranked with its untouched  kill total i never farmed or even DMed with it ever kill is from comp. I would never ditch that skin.there are two skins i regret losing a ST MA asiimov with a VP sticker and a ST AK redline with stickers from my top  teams both BS both traded for other skins and because of the bad memories there i refuse to ditch that UMP.,csgobetting,czbrvwn,1,t5_2zume

6407441,0,t3_43ef7o,Renegades play so inconsistently beating teams like LG one day and then losing to teams they shouldnt on other days. All their upset losses have been in BO games though so this BO style will favor them as they tend to take awhile to warm up in games. CZen winning first map then RNG winning the next two would be the most likely scenario I think.,csgobetting,czhylwa,5,t5_2zume
6409041,0,t3_43h0pt,INITIAL THOUGHTSInitially after seeing these two play I think that Flipsid is favored by a decent margin. With that being said this is a game that honestly could and should end up going . Unless one team chokes or the other plays out of their mind this should be a pretty close game.These are two teams that play very similarly to each other and have pretty close skill levels. Both have extremely close player skill levels and I think that this might be one of the better matches this weekend.Initially I favor Flipsid RECENT PERFORMANCESFlipsidThis team has been performing pretty damn well lately. They recently beat YP and PENTA  each but fell  against Copenhagen Wolves exUnu.AiN. Theyve had some really good results recently like their  against G  although G was really not trying to win there and their pretty long streak of wins went on for a while before finally ending. SKSK has recently fallen off just a bit but are still a pretty strong team. Their last  results were  against LDLC.Blue they fell  against LG and lost  against NaVi. Like I said SK is not a bad team by any means but theyve failed to show us their top potential time and time again here. Its frustrating to see them do extremely well for a couple weeks just to fall back into their usual poor form so we will have to see what this game has in store from them.Recent performances favor Flipsid about LAST MATCHUPLast time these guys played each other SK won in an extremely close  score. They went to overtime on two maps and it was extremely close. Before that they had a really close  that went to Flipsid but that was back when they had DavCost and I think that his absence definitely hurt the team overall. Were not going to talk about that game any longer because it was in November and had a different F lineup so well just focus on the last one.SK took Overpass in an insane  scoreline and was off to a fantastic start. However Flipsid then came back on the second map Mirage and was able to win even though they had started on T side. Something interesting to note is that they both won on the opposing teams map picks which shows just how much their performances can fluctuate. The third map was Train where SK won in overtime. Overall I think that SK was the dominant team  here with Flipsids only map win being extremely close and SK dominating on Overpass. However after going to OT twice and losing on their own map pick this result does show off how close these two teams are in skill.Last matchup favors SK MAPSCacheNot analyzing this map fully because SK always remove it but I would like to note that neither team is very good here. While Flipsid is favored in the offchance that it is played either team could potentially win.Cache probably wont be played but favors Flipsid CobblestoneThis was a map that Flipsid vetod second but they may opt to ban a different one this time around. Cobblestone could very easily go to either team but overall Flipsid do have slightly better results at first glance. The problem with their last games is that some of them have Shara their current th some have Smple and some are back when they have Worldedit. Please keep this in mind as I may miss a game here and there where a team had a sub.Flipsid have a better record on Cobblestone but with that being said their last  games were horrible on it. They recently lost  against Rebels and  against Space Soldiers. They also fell  against CSGO.One. Like I said before these results they played really well but it is safe to say that they have fallen apart on it recently.On the other hand SK used to be awful on Cobblestone but have recently picked up steam. Their last  games were  against Vexed  against DenDD and  against Dignitas. If you look farther back they have really poor stuff against lower tier teams but recently their results have been pretty good here.Cobblestone favors SK  but is very closeDust This map wont be analyzed fully because it should be banned first. Both teams are HORRIBLE on Dust  and Im honestly a bit surprised that Flipsid keep banning it against SK. They are both awful and SK has equally poor scores here. If this map is played expect it to be a slugfest that could easily go to either side.Dust  is a total mess.  but it shouldnt be playedInfernoIm really surprised to see that SK won here on their last game. SK is extremely poor on Inferno and has a  record compared to Fs . Similarly to Cobblestone neither team is exceptional on this map but Flipsid definitely have the edge even with their last loss. Fs last  games on Inferno were  against ENCE  against Vexed and  against HS.GG. They are definitely nowhere near good on Inferno but SK just has terrible scores on it across the board. However SKs games were pretty much always against Tier  or higher teams while Flipsid has a lot of easy wins against lower teams that has padded their stats a bit. Against stronger teams we see them fall apart and play really poorly.I think SK know that their win was a bit of a fluke here as they actually banned this map second when they played on it earlier this month. Their last  scores on Inferno were  against Fnatic  against Flipsid and  against Vexed. I think that they will veto this one again if they can but if not I can easily see it going to either team.Inferno favors Flipsid at about  in my opinion.MirageI havent seen anything exceptional out of SK here so Im honestly pretty surprised to see that they actually picked this map in their last matchup. SK are  compared to Flipids  on Mirage and I think that Flipsid is honestly the better team here. Their last match on it ended up with Flipsid winning  but it was a really close one. SK did manage to drop LG on here in their last tournament but as we all saw LG was playing like complete garbage during that day. SK proved that it was just a fluke by falling  against NaVi on the same day. SKs last  games were these two results plus the  against Flipsid. Flipsid is pretty solid on Mirage and I think they can take it. Their last  matches on it were  against SK  against ENCE and  against HellRaisers. They honestly are just a stronger team overall here and I think that they should win on this map.Mirage favors Flipsid OverpassI can see why Flipsid wanted to play on this map. They were on a hot streak and they had recently beaten HellRaisers  they dropped Rebels  and destroyed YP . They had also beaten SK  in their last game. What they failed to take into account is that not only did they have an extremely close game on Overpass last time but they also had DavCost. Without him they are not quite the same team on this map. Also SK are extremely talented on this map and have taken down massive titans on it. Because of these mistakes from Flipsid when analyzing the team SK was able to destroy them in a very easy .SK is very good on Overpass and they play pretty professionally on it. Their last  matches on Overpass were  against LG  against Flipsid and  against Vexed. Theyve improved immensely on this map and even have two separate wins against Fnatic on it. I think that if Overpass is played again it will be much closer than  but SK still have to be favored.Overpass favors SK TrainTrain is pretty much a coinflip in my opinion. These two teams are very close in skill and records for Train and their last match ended up with a very close  victory for SK. While Flipsid has a slightly better record here it should be noted that similarly to Inferno they have most of their wins against low tier teams. SK didnt get this luxury and has a poor record due to only playing against teams like TQM LG and Dignitas.SKs last  matches were  against LG  against Flipsid and  against Vexed. The loss against Vexed looks bad but we must remember that Train is probably Vexeds best map and that overall SK is still decent here.While SK look shaky Flipsid look even more so on this map. Fs last  games were  against SK  against ENCE and a very close  against Deathtrap some Turkish team. This doesnt give their full story though as even with this current lineup the team has recent wins against Arcade and Rebels.Train is very close but favors SK SK is favored on  mapsFlipsid is favored on  mapsI can see  maps going to either teamMaps are basically FINAL THOUGHTSThis is an insanely close match and I think that the CSGL odds are way off currently  favoring F. Either team could easily win this based on which maps are played. The important thing to note is that while Flipsid have a very slight edge in that they seem to be slightly more dominant on two maps whereas SK only has one map that they should be able to tuck away safely. This means that in a BO format if they are able to get one of their top maps played they should be able to secure it.However SK is a good team and has a slightly deeper map pool in my opinion. I would honestly say that in a BO I would favor them to win but in this BO format I cant really pick a winner. If the teams get their top vetos I think that it should end in a  score but if one team is playing exceptionally well or the map veto goes the wrong way thats when the  possibility comes into play.MY ODDS  favoring FlipsidRISK Good luck and happy betting!Full list of my predictions,csgobetting,czi563a,3,t5_2zume

6446566,0,t3_43z6ea,the odds are changing quite a bit right now for this match so its hard to give much advice but let me say this.  Enigma has little to no history to look at.  They are basically a new team if this is not true can someone link me to some info on them and I am having difficulty finding any information on them.  That being said an obvious advantage lies to RCTIC who have been in the Pro scene for quite some time.  Without a doubt they have more experience and consequently most likely have a larger map pool and more teamworkstrats.  Furthermore RTICs players average around  hrs in the past  weeks which is pretty good.  Now this is a BO which probably works well for RCTIC since it gives them a chance to take advantage of their experience and hopefully map pool.  Despite all these things leaning towards RTICs side be wary of your bet since Enigma can be a wild card with the start of their career.  Ultimately due to the lack of Enigmas history and my knowledge of their team I dont feel safe in making any big bets on either side.  But if RCTIC drops below  They are at  at time of writing then I will drop a lowish bet on them.  Anything I might have missed or left out please tell me,csgobetting,czm45ge,3,t5_2zume

I believe if you inspect the element too you can find the source video to stream in on a program like VLC Media Player where youll get significantly less lagstuttering.Honestly though DingSh!t works just as good as Twitch and Azubu for me.

6671188,0,t1_d09cmrp,Looking at the current odds at CSGOLounge  to OpTic is ridiculous in any circumstances. They are heavy favourites to win this but honestly I dont believe this would be a worthy bet. Judging the current form and the skill of the players OpTic are clear favourites. While they are  in their last  matches ACE being  theyve played much more challenging opponents with SPLYCE and Torment being their opponents. ACE having played RONIN and WinOut.net. ACE also lost to Noble  which is somewhat ridiculous.In my opinion the odds are  to OpTic or If you really wanted to bet Id wait for odds to drop to around the ish mark and go medhigh on OpTic.If odds stay this high in the lowmid s you could do an ICB on ACE and you might get hilariously lucky.I personally am skipping this game dont think its worth risking many skins for a small reward especially because NA CSGO is unpredictable this year.,csgobetting,d09cwt7,-5,t5_2zume

Renegades however lost vs C in overtime even though Cloud  isnt that much of a trainteam.Odds should be around  I think.It could be possible that Splyce practiced train since no one in their group at MLG looks particularly strong on train as some kind of secret weapon but that is pure speculation.,csgobetting,d19t8el,-2,t5_2zume

7011743,0,t3_4bo5y4,Selfless have been winning too much.That is a problem with all teams.If you start winning a lot of matches the team members think they can easily win it.Basiclly if selfless start loosing about  rounds in a row they will go for many YOLO rounds and loose them eventually getting tac pauses and have mental breakdowns.Mental breakdown  Players suddenly become Psychos.Anyway on the other hand NRGHave lost and won a few matches.Its a good thing since they know how to control themselves in hard situations and dont want to repeat mistakes in past matches.But if NRG dont win the pistol roundsIt will be  easy rounds for Selfless and well who knows how aggressive selfless will become.If NRG dont make mistakes in the start of each map I think NRG have a chance at this.My odds  NRG  SelflessIts a risky match but I only have . dollars worth of skins lol.YOLO,csgobetting,d1b4mfa,1,t5_2zume

7104259,0,t3_4crmxe,Astralis v Fnatic analysis by fatalexepandacmhIm a relatively new predictoranalyst to the scene and would appreciate more support from people. I am partnering with a friend Lessthanr uQingno which does amazing Dota  analysis and predictions as well. We have a high win rate and currently making profit for our  challenge but we only have  inactive members in our group and just  viewers for our spreadsheet. Check out our spreadsheet here!Note I appreciate comments and feedback please do tell me anything I did wrongly and I will correct it instead of downvoting and burying my post into oblivion for no reason. Thanks!FnaticUndisputably the best team in CSGO right now. The amount of talent in their team is insane with players like flusha JW Olofmeister.. all five of them are capable of crazy individual plays WHILE having good teamwork. In CSGO such a good roster is hard to come by. Looking at their past records they isnt much to analyze since they have won so many games compared to losses. YES they did lose a BO to Liquid just days ago and to be honest that is quite expected from me Fnatic always drops  game in major tournaments for some reason. Couple with the fact that Liquid is coming in strong as underdogs Fnatic might have relaxed too much against them. Instead we will analyze this differently talking about issues to be considered later on.AstralisexTSM exTQM. This team always has alot of potential to upset yet they choke everytime in semi finals. Well when players like device are on point let me say that they can really steamroll teams. From what I observe Astralis always lack the confidence required to face top teams always losing that mental game and choke and tilt in semisfinals. The last time they met in IEM Katowice LAN Astralis did get a win against Fnatic in Cache so that is something to be considered. Astralis is coming in strong they look much more confident in their games and pretty much is acting like a top team in this major. If they keep the composure I feel like they could edge out a slight chance of winning and at least  map to grab.MapsBan Mirage. It is no secret that Fnatic doesnt play on Mirage often so we can skip this analysis.Ban Cobble. When was the last time u saw Astralis play Cobble? Cache Well this would be a close game. As mentioned earlier Astralis did win against Fnatic on this particular map and they look quite strong even outside of major tournaments. Fnatic is also good at this map but to be honest both are almost equal.  for both teams.Dust As mentioned in my other analysis this map is a balanced map to me. For Astralis they are very good on this map at one point managing to defeat Mouz who is arguably one of the strongest team in dust. Fnatic are no joke either beating Astralis  in a very close game. However looking at the Liquid v Fnatic upset Im not sure if it will affect their mentality going in. Because of that I will give Astralis a slight edge of .TrainThis map I will favour Fnatic by some margin over Astralis. Astralis is not a particularly good team on Train looking back at CounterPit tournament they dropped many rounds against NRG. This alone makes me feel that they do not know this map well enough as compared to Fnatic who is able to beat top teams on this map. for FnaticInfernoInferno is a famous map for Fnatic they managed to beat several top teams I feel like repeating this statement alot. Astralis lost to Fnatic  previously and did not look too good against other teams either albeit beating Navi recently.  for FnaticOverpassWell Fnatic are really good on Overpass looking at how they managed to win against LG when they were down . Astralis on the other hand didnt look too good seeing at how they lost to Fnatic Navi LG G. Overpass is a map olofmeister and JW shines in and I expect them to have the advantage. for Fnatic.Issues to consider. Olofmeisters hand injury. Now for those out of the loop recently olof has hurt his hand and this might affect his ability to frag which we saw during their game against Liquid bottom fragging!. I lost count of the times where teams like LG or NaVi seemingly had the round only for Olof to come up with insane clutches with his aim and game sense. This will be a huge factor to consider about.. Quarterfinal match. We all know the famous Astralis Semifinal choke but how about now? Choking in semi finals are talked about everywhere on reddit and is well know for sure that is a mental block for Astralis. This time however things are different. Astralis is well prepared and I hope their mental game is on point.. Fnatic lost against Liquid. Remember flusha tweeting after the crazy  overtime game between Fsid and Mouz? Flusha literally said even with their stomping ability they cannot save the schedule from being ruined. What happened next? they lost to Liquid. Im not sure how that game affects their mental strength.. Astralis motive to win. Astralis as we know is a new organization formed by exTSMexTQM. Until now they still havent won a major LAN tournament and if they want to achieve that what other event is more suitable than the first  million Major?ConclusionOverall I would still have to give Fnatic the edge to get the series however depending on the maps I think that Astralis can get  map.CSGL Odds  favoring FnaticFanobet odds .. favoring FnaticMy odds  favoring FnaticMy bet High on Fnatic if lt Low on Astralis if lt. Low on maps gt..As mentioned earlier Im relatively new and doing this for free with my partner and would like to expand our audience with the detailed analysis that we provide.

7104566,0,t1_d1lnz5k,... thank you so much. I am stupid as fuck and wouldve never noticed. There was a typo the system doing to scores is supposed to give scores if the entry exactly matches the winner we enter. While the system was checking for Virtus.Pro the form had Virtus Pro without the dot which doesnt match and no points were awarded because of that.

7223274,0,t3_4edqzo,tldr Ive already dealt with IRS shit grossing over k on the Steam market. By law they are obligated to notify the IRS and send a K form. Which is essentially a form sent to businesses that deal with online and CC transactions. I was informed when I brought in the items history of sales and purchases throughout the year that since I have no direct link to withdraw my Steam wallet funds from the client and transfer them to my bank that I did not need to file taxes for it. tldr version of mine skins have no real world monetary value thats why sites like CSGL are able to operate. I just wish Fanobet would realize this or instead apply for the proper licenses so certain states at least would be allowed to bet on their site. Since they offer sports gambling now which has certain restrictions from statetostate.Also if youre cashing shit out on OPSkins then be aware not to make over k transactions selling and purchasing while at the same time try to avoid making over  in the fiscal year. Otherwise YOU WILL need to file these forms due to transferring REAL money to PayPal.,csgobetting,d1z8d49,1,t5_2zume

7273217,0,t3_4etp0x,Previous ResultsDignitas Dignitas have been in an upswing even before DreamHack and DH is no different. Dig got the playoff bye in group C by defeating NiP  on Overpass  rounds on their Tside  on CT  and defeating Astralis  on Cache  rounds on their CTside and  in a row after losing the first  rounds on the second half. It must be noted that their win against NiP seemed to be a combination of Digs performance and NiPs underperformance but Digs win against Astralis was a very convincing one. knfig has definitely been Digs mvp top fragging in both of these matches.EnVyUs EnVy have gone through a much rougher path than Dig so far losing their first match by  rounds against Tempo Storm  on Cobble and catching a stride in the final rounds to eliminate FaZe from the tournament . Their most recent series against Tempo Storm was a story of apEX and NBK stepping up with Happy trailing close behind to stop Tempo cold in their tracks. They pulled off an impressive  on Dust Tempos map pick and closed the series  by taking a  on Inferno. ampnbspWhat We Know Dignitas have won  out of their last  maps and have an impressive . average ROI in their last  CSGL games EnVyUs have won  out of their last  maps  out of their  of their most recent maps and have a . average ROI in their last  CSGL games Dig are  against EnVy in their current rosters the maps were Mirage and Inferno EnVys Tside at an average of . has been Digs kryptonite in their headtohead but Dig reduced that average to . in their last two matchesampnbspLingering ThoughtsQuestions  EnVy need to find a way to deal with knfig before he runs away with the the series. Dignitas is arguably EnVys toughest opponent up to this point in DH Malmo. apEX and NBK showing up again will need to happen considering Digs form so far.  DEVIL has been at the bottom of EnVys score lines in all of their games. Can EnVy continue to win with DEVILs lack of presence in their games?ampnbspMap PickBan ScenarioThe map pickban phase for the rest of the tournament will proceed as follows Team A removes a map gt Team B removes a map gt Team A picks a map gt Team B picks a map gt Team A removes a map gt Team B removes a map gt Remaining map will be played if needed. Team A and Team B are decided by a coin toss. I will assume Dignitas is Team A for a potential mappick ban scenario. This one was a tough one to predict but I think it should go like thisampnbspDignitas removes Train gt EnVyUs removes Overpass gt Dignitas picks Inferno gt EnVyUs picks Cobblestone gt Dignitas removes Dust   gt EnVyUs removes Cache gt Mirage remainsampnbspInferno This is the map where Dignitas took a strong lead on CT  against EnVy last week. Funny enough knfig was nd top fragger and apEX and NBK were on the bottom of the table. With the current trend this will most likely not be the case and it will be a test to see who has studied the most on their last matchup. I imagine that the results of this match who wins and by how much as well as who shows up will determine how the rest of the series will go. Dignitas will also have the advantage of being able to analyze EnVys match against Tempo on this map as well. Cobblestone EnVyUs havent been doing well as a whole so they have lost on Cobble quite often however their last match against Dig two months ago on this map was a  blowout and they have been taking wins or keeping their losses close on it. Dignitas have won on Cobble in the  out of their  most recent matches wins against VP Mousesports AGG and loss against Hellraisers but they werent clean victories. Mirage Mirage hasnt been one of Envys maps since the roster swap and their performance on it has been questionable. Dignitas have won the last  times they have played on Mirage but  out of  of those were VERY close. Despite this I still think Mirage will favor Dignitas by a small margin. ampnbspConclusionI thought that this series would favor Dignitas a lot more before I worked my way through this analysis but the maps tell a much closer tale. I stand by statement that I made for Inferno and I think that Dignitas has to fire on full cylinders on this map to win the series otherwise I can see EnVys resurgence in this tournament upsetting the Dignitas  lineup that looks to be in their top form. My verdict  in favor of Dignitas  if Dig starts strong.  ampnbspRisk HighOdds Dignitas  EnVyUsI hope you find this information useful and let me know what moreless you would like to see! You can find more information here I will be asleep in about an hour so if you have any questions before the match please let me know ASAP! ,csgobetting,d24wzm1,0,t5_2zume

7311823,0,t3_4feehh,Quick analysis for the betting addicted ones that are broke from dreamhack malmoAstralis is probably one of the best Dust  teams. Didnt play any big games since dreamhack so theyre not tired or something.AstralisAstralis is a very strong team. I always say that they totally have the potential to be a major champion but they dont show up their Agame if they have to. Astralis is a team that completely destroy lower tier teams. If you like max n relax Astralis is the team you wanna place your bets on. Theyre trustworthier than most gambling sites.Astralis has  player that constantly show up in some way with incredible shots to destroy their opponents Cajun Device Dupreeh Xypx Karrigan is in my opinion one of the best ingame leaders in the world after Fallen. FaZeFaZe is currently in a slump if you wanna call it a slump. They recently lost Maikelele and picked up Ko. Kio said in an interview that he didnt took a break of cs for  years. After that break he played dreamhack malmo and actually looked pretty good if you remember they practiced together for  day. The other player from FaZe can show up but cant really carry their entire team alone.Dust Dust  is a pug map. In pug maps you prefer raw aim over strategies cuz youre playing with people you havent done any practice with. Having a few set strats heavily helps a team. The more important thing however is the communication between the players when to rotate and when a MidtoB split is coming or something.Zonic Astraliscoach said that Astralis does have a communication problem. However Astralis is still a team that have a high chemistry and fit together very well. FaZe recently picked up kio to replace maikelele. If you have a new player you need some time to get the communication rolling and giving him the perfect spots on a map.Astralis however probably shares the spot for the worlds greatest Dust  with a few other teams. Xypx is great at holding the BSide alone. Being able to hold the BSide alone is a really great advantage to have. Also device just goes full godmode on Dust . He can go with the AWP wherever he wants as a CT or T and just do incredible plays.ConclusionAstralis shouldnt drop this map at all since theyre better on Dust  in general and skillwise. If one of the star player from Astralis show up it will be very hard for FaZe to have a shot. However if  player from FaZe really show up and Astralis somehow choke they can take this map.My odds Remember this is a BO and anything can happenThis is my first analysis Ive written on reddit so please excuse my poor.Spreadsheet Error  link not found,csgobetting,d29az3v,0,t5_2zume

7342302,0,t3_4fwipb,Quick Analysis on this gameI think everyone will agree that NIP have been on an absolute rampage lately. They just came out of a convincing LAN win and have been unstoppable lately. It really looks like they have started to fire on all cylinders as pyth has become a more integral part of the team. I think they will definitely win this B. THAT BEING SAID  these lounge odds are ridiculous.  currently on lounge on  a B between two top teams? Right after a major LAN? I wouldnt feel confident betting on NiP at those odds and I wouldnt advise anyone else to either. Especially because NiP and VP share similar map pools. I would say the odds are closer to  NiP and a small VP bet would be smart here. Again I dont expect VP to win here but at these odds I cant resist betting. Golden Rule boys. TLDR Lounge has  odds skip or  VPThis is a new thing I am trying as a fun hobby let me know what you think of the analysis so I can improve!

7529650,0,t3_4igpkf,So for the past month NIP has been on their Agame with their current roster.The last game I saw with NIP against Astralis they were on a tear  completely dominating their Tside on cache GetRights solo B control was phenomenal.Although I do not keep deep track of every single team NIP has been doing very well lately    their losses going only to VP in triple overtime and NaVi who is currently considered in ranking as the number one team globally NIP is looking very strong right now and personally I can see NIP taking this series as long as they keep their roster. Im going to put a medium bet on NIP as the odds very good and Astralis must have their best game yet against NIP in order to take this.Most likely bans will be overpass by NIP and cobblestone by Astralis however any picks after that can go any way since Astralis might not want a repeat of the last time they played against each other.If you really arent sure about this bet watch NIP against Dignitas and see they are completely dominant as they should be. Most importantly go ahead and follow your gut as the most trustworthy predictions come from your own knowledge.Good luck and happy betting!,csgobetting,d2y3201,1,t5_2zume

Their mappool and pick will end up in team A being heavily favored on their pick team B being heavily favored on their map but the third map could really go either way. So basically the match would be a real  lounge odds are also  but you want to make profit of this game. Isnt it suggestive to go for the Team AB will win at least one map bet on fanobet?

7647944,0,t1_d3biini,Its actually easy. Theres  important factors you gotta think of Prize moneyMotivation For fnatic they play like gods in majors and after that they just chill out in their games Current place If you can win the series and you dont have the required points for the next stage youre going to play better to get those points. If you cant advance because you lost too many matches already youre not going to play serious Enemy This is probably the most important part i think. Some teams just play way better or worse against a specific team. Take astralis for example. Very good team no question about it. But they always lose to NiP its their cryptonite so to speak. Sometimes this rivalry is even more worth than a teams form. A great example to look at was G at the minor LAN where they beat fnatic and almost LG in the finals,csgobetting,d3bj2d9,1,t5_2zume

7678323,0,t3_4kh4sm,You should really analyze how the teams have been lately playing and not just look at the odds. I looked at the bets you lost and Ive bet on all of those games and won.For example Flipside vs godsentYou should know and have read up that godsent have been turning up the past few weeks and at their last tournament. Sure Flipside is going to be more experienced and a higher tier but when you also look at flipsides past few games you can see that they werent doing very good.That comes back down to the low tier playing good vs high tier playing bad situation. And you honestly should sit out those best as someone said above or do as I do and bet on the low tier team thats doing better recently. Mainly cause their morale is just high and confidence is strong. BUTTTT there can always be a chance where the more experienced team starts winning again which happens quite often.

7886830,0,t1_d41w7sv,I can tell youll be a very successful better. Betting your way would make you broke in the long run bc upsets do happen all the time in cs. Sure G will be the overdog in this game but youll be risking alot to get back little return and if the odds are not correct then that increases the chance of an upset. While betting on Tyloo you risk almost nothing for a big return. Even if you lose this bet you lose little and in the long run youll win more bc upsets happen. The correct way of betting is to play the odds not about picking the winner.,csgobetting,d42jwlz,2,t5_2zume

Hope this helpsJust telling you guys that my bet will be LOW on SK to winThe reason why is explained belowEven though SK dosent have pimp anymore and magisk is not playing in this one they have valde and glave. These two players are really good and you may have seen them before on CPH Wolves. Immortals is favoured I agree but  is too high for a team that performed like dog crap in ELEAGUE. SK are underrated against better teams but they have shown that they are able to compete and sometimes best teams like Astralis and NRG.However REMEMBER that Immortals are still a very good Brazilian team.

CSGL will lose all their traffic and if Valve ever works something out then other competitors will likely fill that space before CSGL can get any traction.

If either team gets good maps and gets the momentum rolling I can see this going either way tbh.Based on the odds Id say the smartest bet is to go low on Nok to win  . or Nok to win at least  map .I will probably go with  map since it is a lot safer.

After i saw longue uptade i gave up for skin betting.Im  percent sure viewership will be effected by this uptadeif i dont bet on t or t games i wont watch their games.Ill watch just t teams matches.We will see how it will be effected.Finnaly i hope we will see good news from lounge cause they said they have been working on new uptades.,csgobetting,d67um2j,6,t5_2zume

8961035,0,t3_530thu,Virtus.Pro vs GambitGambit is getting underrated again and I love it. The pure fact that a . bet gives you . odds is ridiculous. Please keep in mind that Gambit back at Cologne beat Astralis with glave but still . Gambits the best CIS team besides NaVi especially on LAN.  But what makes Gambit so good? Well first off AdreN has stepped up real big lately. Hes been an absolute beast with him on a site youre certain to get atleast a trade kill and most of the times he gets ks in positions where he shouldnt. This goes along with his clutch potential and his pistol skill. Enough about AdreN Gambit is also great because its a mix of good fraggers and a good IGL. Hooch is a respected IGL Dosia is a pretty good lurker and mou is an inconsistent awper but when hes fired up he can get you match wins.VP has not been looking all that great lately they just seem out of form and I know they havent pracced that much lately but still you have to atleast come close to beating Envy whos using a standin. What made VP win Eleague? Snax and byali were in god mode while lately theyve been nothing like that. When comparing hrs its quite obvious that Gambit have been bootcamping lately for this tournament while VP well... they might have practiced a bit but still nothing impressive.The thing VP has going for them is the headhead. Although most of those games were at Eleague where they were in absolute plow mode its still a thing that is Map veto VP bans Dust Gambit bans Overpass VP bans Nuke Gambit bans Mirage VP bans Cobblestone Gambit bans Cache Map will be Train Train Both teams love this map and theyre really comfortable on it. They have good Tsides but also good CTholds.

First round...North gt GambitFnatic gt GSK gt HRVP gt OpticNaVi gt MouzLiquid lt NVAstralis gt GodsentFaZe gt FBased on my wild predictions it means that the... GroupNorth Fnatic SK VP NaVi NV Astralis FaZe I think that within this group SK VP NaVi and Astralis have the greatest chance to beat each other or FazeNVNorthFnatic. Since you cant predict the matches Id pick one of SK VP NaVi and Astralis as the team to go  and after that its pretty random because its almost guaranteed that they wont all play the teams that should lose meaning this entire analysis will be fucked from the beginning  Group Gambit G HR Optic Mouz Liquid Godsent F Id assume Liquid and F have the greatest chance of losing and will probably go out without winning a map.

10520367,0,t3_5qj78f,This will be the biggest test of Karrigans leadership so far. FaZe have had some impressive results and Ive seen a linear progression from this team since he joined. All this team needed was leadership to direct the insane firepower of this team. Even though FaZe is consistently improving I still dont feel as though they are at the level SK are at even with a standin. You have to keep in mind that SK have won the last  majors and have the current rank  AND  players in the world. On top of this FalleN is undisputedly the best IGL in the world and any player under his leadership improves immensely once they learn the system he has in place. Two things will need to happen in order for FaZe to beat SK tonight. FalleN or coldzera need to have a bad game and FaZe need to come out super strong early on and shut them down because if they let SK get rolling at all then it is game over for FaZe I simply cannot see them being able to stop SK once they get warmed up.SK Form The biggest surprise to me so far is that FalleN is the second lowest out of the team at . rating with an ADR of  which is pretty poor considering what he is capable of this is due to the fact that he is obviously catering for fox and helping him feel comfortable by giving him the AWP and for those who dont know FalleN is one of the most talented AWPers in the world and has massive impact whenever he gets one so that is a big hit to the firepower of SK. It will be interesting to see if they revert back to FalleN on the main AWP or not because I feel as though fox isnt able to have anywhere near the impact which could hurt them if allu is on point. Coldzera is playing well with a rating of . and ADR of . Fer is the second highest with a rating of . and ADR of . TACO was never the star of the team but he is currently the lowest on the team with a rating of . and ADR of . If he shows up during the finals though along with at least  of the others out of FalleN Coldzera or fer then this match will be over quick.FaZe Form All of FaZe have been performing equally as well during the group stage. Every player is within  ADR of each other which is good to see but we will need to see at least  or  players really firing up tonight to go against the heavy hitters of SK which wont be easy. The main question mark going into this game is will karrigan rise to the occasion or crack under pressure because he seems to have taken the choking with him from Astralis into FaZe from some games I have seen not being able to close out games like the SK game in groups where they conceded  match points. VETO SK VETO  NukeFaZe VETO  CobblestoneSK PICK  TrainFaZe PICK  MirageFaZe VETO  DustSK PICK  Overpass Maps played  Train  Mirage  OverpassOverall Train   to SKSK wont lose this map unless something goes horribly wrong they are  WINS and  LOSSES on this map and most of these wins were against top train teams such as Virtus.Pro Optic NaVi Astralis and NiP. They will win this and it will be up to FaZe not to be phased by this and go into their map with a fresh mind.Mirage  Although FaZe almost beat SK on mirage and its one of their best maps dont expect this to be a shoein for FaZe despite SKs poor results on this map over the last  months. SK will have studied the demo in depth because thats the type of person FalleN is and they will have fixed their mistakes for sure if anything this will work against FaZe because SK have such amazing natural team chemistry much like fnatic at their prime. If FaZe come out strong and maintain pressure they could win it for sure but its going to be a tough ask.Overpass   to SKSK used to be amazing on this map they had random plays of aggression and were really unpredictable to play against which threw off a lot of teams. Their recent results show a different story but I saw them prior to this and know what theyre capable of. FaZe also played the map a bunch of times recently which will have given FalleN information about how they play CT and T side so you can expect some antistratting from SK. Overall   to SK. My pick is SK to win  unless train is close then .PM me for an invite to our private group,csgobetting,dd0lig3,3,t5_2zume

They are also a extremely streaky team. So I need further look at some vods since i dont watch kinguin as much as spirit,csgobetting,dfmi20u,2,t5_2zume

CLG may have a small chance on Train so id go very low on them if that is the map however if the map is any other than Nuke I would go low or medium on Gambit to take this.,csgobetting,dfy21h3,1,t5_2zume
