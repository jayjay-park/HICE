10937194,0,t3_5w37y6,Welp off the top of my head...with the help of my Latin dictionary from back in high school Latin years ago...dont report me to my teacher for cheating.  My inspirations are the stray kittens that I found a few months ago and have been feeding for god knows why ever since and the Tuf Voyaging series by George R R Martin.Interlopers BloomThis is a flower with beautiful purple petals that grows in Dunkelwald.  Its black stem has many thorns the tips of which are venomous to the touch and can lead to serious medical problems if it gets into the blood.  Because of the potency of this flower and the uniqueness of its venom it was named Interlopers Bloom in honor of Dunkelwalds deities.  There are only two known types of creatures that are fine with getting a bit of it into their bloodstream from a thorncut The Habicht royal family of East Dunkelwald one of the four royal families of Dunkelwald and the Motuschen.  While even a Habicht person would not try to eat one of these flowers Motuschen seem to love them.MotuschenThese creatures are about the size of real world cats and could be mistaken for normal cats.  They are extremely rare to find both because of their low numbers and because of their natural defenses theyre small theyre quick and they mess with your head.  Their abilities are not fully understand but they seem to be able to give your mind a little push when youre within range of them.  If theyre hiding in a tree that tree just doesnt seem like an interesting place to check out you might call them psychic.   They frequently eat Interlopers Blooms but other than that seem to only eat meat.  They do not eat any other type of plant interestingly.  These can be either pure white or mostly white.  They are considered the day version of their most effective predators the Valichen.ValichenThey are very similar to their prey the Motuschen.  Valichen are the about the size of real world cats and could easily be mistaken for cats.  Unlike the Motuschen the Valichen do not have their psychic abilities of persuading your mind in a certain direction but instead have a different talent.  Valichen are capable of causing a Motuschen to be braindead if it gets close enough and is capable of causing seizures in humans and other animals if it is within range.  They are considered the night version of the Motuschen.  Valichen are either pure black or mostly black.,WorldChallenges,de83fg1,3,t5_3j78c

Yeah the ones who killed their spouses are usually abandoned and ignored.  And the ones that kill their children after their spouse dies.  Those people are generally not helped at all. Yeah a lot.

Alternatively you could eat more souls to kind of dilute the one you dont like but.... Yes most other cultures bury or burn their dead and see eating a part of them as disrespectuous.

11233376,0,t1_df4zyz6, I think wed all be better off without the Excaeli. Very funny.  While Ive learned my share of history the real historians follow Procyon.  After all his library houses the most complete history of the entire world.  What I would give to be his follower...  but Im a Luminare.  My life is for Polaris and Mother Lumis alone. The patrons are by far more powerful.  Their children are only human.  Its only that their children were more polarizing and less universally accepted.  This made them much more influential in the history the world. Its usually white or silver. Nothing...  I dont think of him any differently from any other Excaeli.... not at all.  He may just happen to defy Lumis but unlike the others hes trustworthy...  dont ask why.  Why are you asking me this? My fellow Luminare and I are not crazy.  We do good work we are diplomats explorers peacekeepers soldiers and scholars.And Mother Lumis exists.  I have no doubts... she is selfless and she is coming and I wont have to kill them all by myself because she will be there...  and when she does youll die.

11555902,0,t1_dg5u1mn, The few records from that period of the Varian Kingdom that were not destroyed in the fire of the Regillus which destroyed most of the Royal Records seem to agree that Septim was a foremost scholar of his time. He had studied in the Dekatia in Thetis and sought to create an institution that could rival it. The Royal Academy flourished in its first years and was later incorporated into the Arcanarium relinquishing parts of its universality for a stronger focus in the art and science of the Arcane. The Enchanted Isles is a place awash with legend and it is a scholars most usual pastime to speculate on what may be found in their fabled shores from parts of Archon constructs to new magics to legendary creatures long since gone from the rest of the world. The only thing holding said scholars back from exploring the Enchanted Isles is the fact that noone has come back alive from them. I suppose it was the incentive of knowledge beyond what could be attained anywhere else that drove Septim to explore them thus making him and his companions they only ones to have succeeded. Unfortunately the war didnt leave much time for writing or Septims writings were lost to the fire as there is no existing account of his voyage to date. Any true Varian would immediately reply that it was the Tritons. However to a student of History the world works in various shades of gray. The tritonic zeal about anything concerning the isles was surely the cause of full blown war but in the years leading to it both parties were to blame. Varian fishing fleets ventured further and further into Triton territory while Triton warbands exacted retribution on fishing villages by decimating them. The Varians answered that by razing coastal settlements and capturing tritons for slaves. It all culminated to a point were all out war was inevitable as both sides pushed each other to the extreme. The Diadems theft was simply a good enough cause for the Tritons to rally behind and finally push their rivals out of the Siren Sea for good.The diadem is believed lost with the man that wore it. Septim died within a year of using it and his tombs location where it must have been interred with him unless it was stolen is lost.,WorldChallenges,dg5v5ws,2,t5_3j78c

11628810,0,t1_dgbqrup,Sorry for the delay!gt How hard is it to obtain STRSS?Pretty hard because once again it seems Mavericks the only one who actually knows how to properly make it. There are likely some other blackmarketers who have heard of it and are trying to replicate it but usually its pretty improper and rare anyway since yknow black market and all.gt  Is STRSS actually chemically addictive or does the Maverick just feel a constant addictive need to get rid of sobriety in any way?It is and concerns of addiction were partially responsible for leading to it being outlawed in the first place. Its both a stimulant but also an emotional damper and so without it all the horrific memories and emotions can come at you at once if you dont get proper treatment and therapy.Unfortunately in Mavericks case he did not.gt  What are the other side effects of STRSS?The main longterm sideeffect of taking STRSS observed with Maverick appears to be lung damage and he has quite a few issues with breathing and a lot of dizziness while breathing fresh air.Aside from that another big issue is born out of its entire purpose in that while it increases focus and dampens emotion it doesnt eradicate baggage and stress just restrains it. So without it hes going to have some serious withdrawal problems since that would mean confronting all the trauma of whatever happened to him during the war and his severalyear disappearance all at once that STRSS was supposed to block out and considering hes kinda violent getting him off the stuff is going to be problematic.,WorldChallenges,dge4zd9,2,t5_3j78c

Thats why the candle is the same color as them right? the cult is basically the opposite of what Lambrecht wanted to do when did it started to go that way? Quickly after his death or slowly over centuries? is there still people following the path in its original form? relations between the eventual different branches? public perception of the cult? Is it a secret sect because being public would be dangerous? Or people just think its weird so its best to avoid disclosing it? if I understand rather the second how important are Lambrecht paraboles? How ritualizedcodified is the cult?
