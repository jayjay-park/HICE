5562089,0,t3_3rb6gl,I completed the Honors Colloquia.  of those  classes were some of the best classes with one of the best professors Dr. Pitcock I took at TCU. For that reason alone Id recommend it. Also theres still the early sign up for the rest of your classes which was clutch one of the most underrated perks as an Honors student in my opinion. Plus the extra hooding ceremony at the end of it all is a really awesome experience. But in terms of resume  the opinion of potential employers it really wont make a significant difference although the classes Nature of Giving especially did give me some good answers and talking points during interviews. Hope that helps!,TCU,cwmj0d9,4,t5_2rg8z

5569915,0,t3_3rb6gl,I got lucky and ended up having all the time in the world to complete lower and upper division honors. I finished the colloquia last year and got to take two incredible classes one was a recurring project I enrolled in thrice and am planning on taking another if possible when I get back from studying abroad. Is it all that important? No no one will give a fuck if youre using it for jobs. If you apply for more school or a job in academia it could help but especially the collogquia program really has few tangible merits. If you buyin to the idea of liberal arts and learning for the sake of learning then it can actually be a great experience. .,TCU,cwnhz7a,2,t5_2rg8z
