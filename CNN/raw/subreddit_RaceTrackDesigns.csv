839065,0,t3_23gky1,I like the circuit design although the front stretch is really short outside of the endurance track. Id suggest following someoneinsanes advice too.,RaceTrackDesigns,cgznkkj,1,t5_2u3tp
841439,0,t1_cgzuux9,Please do! I considered recreating a real track before starting on this project but the sheer size and difficulty of getting the exact angles right kinda turned me off from it.,RaceTrackDesigns,cgzxa65,1,t5_2u3tp
1102363,0,t1_chq1oah,I actual dont think so. only a small portion would actually have to be closed. and Im pretty sure if those residents can survive  hours of engines and tires being murdered than they can survive another weekend.,RaceTrackDesigns,chtlf71,1,t5_2u3tp

1961175,0,t3_2h3w0m,So I took the last two off because other than reprofiling a few chicanes  Ididnt have many good ideas. But Ive had a right go at Singapore.My track design has three elements to it To make the overly long track shorter. This track is . miles which is a quartermile shorter than the current track. To increase the driving challenge. Ive done this in several instances. Turn  is a Parabolicastyle left hander Turn  the right hander behind the pits has been scraped to make it quicker as theres plenty of room on the inside for adequate run off Turn  now follows a much longer run off Raffles Boulevard. Turns  and  are a flat out S leading to Turn  and then a flat out left hander onto Connaught Road  probably the only part where Im a little concerned that adequate run off might not exist. Ive improved the overtaking at Turn  by turning it into a second gear hairpin and then a flat out little kink onto Raffles Avenue leading to a second gear chicane onto the permanent circuit  Im proud to say the only chicane on the whole track.  To make it different to Cyclones design who posted almost everything I planned to do to the circuit!  ,RaceTrackDesigns,ckpiups,2,t5_2u3tp
2060910,0,t1_cl1mzvn,patience is key i guess... I think those of us who go hand drawn do the same thing as you I just take a picture of it as my scanner broke... and then I use paint to rotate it to the correct layout.,RaceTrackDesigns,cl1sbl5,1,t5_2u3tp
2063440,0,t1_cl21zj3,It is not so much Routebuilder itself its more that a couple users were absolutely spamming the front page with  corner circuits in tiny villages.

2200704,0,t3_2kantb,both circuits look fun and interesting to drive on!Ive used an almost replica of your last section in mine entry but have tried using the shorter runways as well as it presented a good overtaking opportunity at the end.,RaceTrackDesigns,cljkaro,2,t5_2u3tp

4378994,0,t1_csj8143,Definitely looks problematic to me. A car going wide or aquaplaning into turn  like Interlagos in the wet would be travelling headon into the pit exit.Extending the pitlane past turn  would fix the problem,RaceTrackDesigns,csj8xp8,1,t5_2u3tp

4701277,0,t1_ctn4m21,The road layout in London would actually allow you to do that very easily. It would be easier than the way Ive laid it out as my way needs a temporary structure on one point to take you from the embankment up to the strand . The only issue is it would turn the embankment in to an about . mile straight. EDIT for correct road name,RaceTrackDesigns,ctn4upn,2,t5_2u3tp

4981425,0,t3_3iyni0,Thankyou uxiiiDex and uGullibleGoose for the comments. I hadnt thought about Moss being so close to the water with its elevation but thats a good point. I replaced it with T Dunlop from Nurburgring and replaced the kink with a longer corner. Updated DesignWhat do you think?,RaceTrackDesigns,cumg2j7,2,t5_2u3tp

6878197,0,t1_d0vtkk5,I love St. Louis and San Jose.  Cleveland is great too you may want to reconsider the pit exit or flip the circuit direction because if a car misses its braking zone in Turn  it could take out a car exiting the pits.,RaceTrackDesigns,d0vyh1m,1,t5_2u3tp

8270676,0,t3_4sp5ak,New to the subreddit so take everything I say with a grain of salt please. I really like what youve done here. The circuit has a feel thats somewhere between Brands Hatch and Monaco so I like that. One criticism I have is that the Washington BoulevardCivic Center Drive section feels a bit boxy though you are contained by reasonable geography. I like what youve done with the Camel Corner it has a certain Circuit de MagnyCours feel to it. Overall a really good job. ,RaceTrackDesigns,d5be5yw,1,t5_2u3tp
