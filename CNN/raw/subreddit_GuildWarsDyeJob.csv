TheDero In order to get a mixture of the orders armors you have to have  character in each of the orders. Then you have to buy the armor you want with those characters and use a transmutation stone on it and a white item Simply to lower the cost which then makes them account bound and you can then transfer them to the character you want and transmute them again to the armor you want.,GuildWarsDyeJob,ces9n2m,1,t5_2v54r

I cant tell eye colour from the pictures I Chili Red seems to fit but in one picture the eyes look yellow which I cannot replicate.As far as I can tell the screenshots were not taken using the vanilla game so you might not be able to recreate it exactly.
