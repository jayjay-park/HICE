7702810,0,t3_4jn8ip,As a female who as been in this situation a few times I feel the person who initiates needs to make it clear whether its a date or just hanging out. She may just think you are only friends and doesnt even know she went on a date with you. You need to be on the same page with her. I hung out with a guy friend last year and he told my other mutual friends we went on a date. I had no idea we were on a date and that left me feeling tricked and naive. When I was in college there was a guy who I got along with quite well and right after class one day he just walked up to me and said Would you like to go on a date with me tomorrow night?. I was in a relationship already so I declined but his forwardness and confidence were refreshing. He was smooth and upfront with his motives. Ill never forget it it was the best way anyone ever asked me out. If you want to go on a date with her the best thing to do is ask her on a date. Make your motives clear and then you will find out how she feels. If she doesnt feel the same thats good too. Dont waste your time. This will free you up to move on to someone else who will appreciate you. ,Emotions,d3hrayj,3,t5_2qjx0
