2745548,0,t3_2g3j3m,The last paragraph rings most true today with many younger adults and teenagers not understanding the nuances of the finer art.

The former days of trolling on IRC are thankfully behind us where it was much harder to latch on to marks and make them emotional with a few sentences. Thankfully with the number of people online vastly improved and their forever connected status thanks to mobile technology emotional wreckage has never been easier. People still wish to believe theyre better than yourself and its so easy to play to that and make them so angry and hasty in proving so. The sweet laugh when reading hastily coupled together insults is only getting easier to achieve. Certainly as people cant fathom staying anonymous on the internet anymore. Its so easy to create a false image of who you are here by posting to subreddits not equal to your character certainly with research into the subject taking a matter of minutes thanks to the very tool of delivery we use. ,beautifultrolls,cng5nvx,1,t5_33ago
