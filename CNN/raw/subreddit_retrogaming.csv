2117522,0,t3_2j0fnf,For the BEST value...you need to have the instruction booklets AND the original box undamaged. When I owned my NES and had to sell it...since I had everything I was able to sell all the games for at least  more than I bought them for.Example  My version of Final Fantasy like the one you have was still in nearnew condition on the surface and the battery still operated after  years. My mom bought the game new for I think .. I sold it years later for a bit over . of course back then there was no internet trading. One of my friends recently sold his Final Fantasy NES cart with book and box in nearnew condition he played that one he sold just for a month before buying another one to be his actual play cartridge PLUS the original Nintendo Power strategy guide in what could be called fairtogood condition frayed covers and the spine was getting a little loose. But he managed to get  from a collector.Some of the others are quite common or easily manufacted now so might not get so much. That ZELDA cart is very shiny and might get good money just because of that. The ADVENTURE OF LINK you have is the secondgeneration cartridge and is worth less than half of the firstgeneration because it was made to have a matching gold cartridge although you could get lucky with it. Best thing to do is check Ebay nd other sources and compare prices. Some of the other comments have very good suggestions on how to do that.You could be sitting on several hundred dollars or more of quality games people will be willing to buy especially if the ones with the batteries still save and havent had to be opened you can tell if the seal on a cart was broken to do that.,retrogaming,cl8zeer,1,t5_2qk6v

3696821,0,t1_cqdklr1,I hate to defend Gamestop but its not a thing its how reselling works. Secondhand stores offer a service in the form of quick and easy selling not full cash value and the margins are a lot lower than people think. I never worked in a game store specifically but when people brought merchandise I would usually offer  of what I was going to mark something at and that was for the decent stuff. Rare exceptions would be higher. But just because Store X makes Y amount of gross dollars doesnt mean its pure gravy and that also assumes that every item sells for what the clerk assumes it will. I assume Gamestop has a corporate list of values employees have to follow since theyre a shitty company but its not because their trade in values are some kind of grossly unfair thing. People choose to sell there even if I sell elsewhere.Also I have no idea how this came across in text form so I just want to be clear Im not trying to start a fight or be douchey and I hope I didnt come off that way its just a personal issue for me when the internet talks about storespeople being unfair when two people agree on a sale.,retrogaming,cqdnun6,4,t5_2qk6v

We either played two player games or went back and forth trading turns. We played a lot of games on those nights but some standout memories are Ikari Warriors one and two and Mega Man. Of course some weekends our parents would take us to the local video store to rent a game. Then it was all weekend nonstop gaming until we either beat the game we rented or got sick of it! This past year my brother came to visit me for my birthday and we ended up spending the evening playing Ikari Warriors on my NES clone. It was cool just like old times.

I cant take anyone seriously when they say a used item should be worth more than its original cost. These are used games and yes I agree that more in demand titles could arguably be worth a higher price but the overall inflation is pricing the average collector out making retro gaming a rich mans hobby. Its outright obnoxious with that comment about hands being outstretched... Get over yourself dude. Retro shops will eventually start to tank when interest wanes collectors have more children and need money and people simply want to clear some space in their houses.Most NES games arent rare but some are wrongfully being kicked as such. Let time be the great equalizer and one day even the playing field. I feel sorry for the poor saps that own retro shops and look at retro games as investments. Have fun dudes another economic downturn is right around the corner with Greece taking an EU exit and other countries soon following suit.

4661212,0,t1_cti3i4q,Well Sega of America didnt know what Sega of Japan was doing. SOA wanted to and thought that SOJ agreed to support the Genesis for another year and make more powerful hardware. The X wouldve had two phases. First is the addon that we got to upgrade existing Genesis models. The second phase wouldve been the Neptune which wouldve been released as the Model  Genesis which wouldve natively supported X games. That way Sega could keep making a ton of money off of Genesis and better compete in the fifth generation. However SOJ rushed Saturn and shot down all of SOAs alternatives and forced SOA to launch Saturn early. I think X couldve worked out under that plan. I also think had Saturn not been launched early that it couldve had better sales. However Saturn shouldnt have been released. SOJ shouldve listened to SOA. ,retrogaming,cti3omu,6,t5_2qk6v

Today its all about greed and the lowattention span of modern gamers.I honestly dont feel this argument holds merit. The NES wasnt the last console to have a decadelong lifespan and wasnt even the longest running barring a Japan only run where it was technically discontinued but still had market availability up until . In the US it spanned  to .  The Playstation  ran from   .  The PS was released in  and has yet to be discontinued.  Even the Wii for its short term novelty had a seven year run as did the N and the Gamecube.  The XBox  has had a decade run and is still on the market.  The original Playstation ran for twelve years from   .The only consoles I can think of that were particularly shortlived were the Gamecube the original XBox and the Dreamcast.There was just as much churn back in the day as there is today. The only difference is that we only remember and particularly care about the good games of the past whereas we are confronted today with bad games simply because theyre still on the market. I think you may be looking at this issue with some rosetinted nostalgia goggles.,retrogaming,cty9acf,3,t5_2qk6v

I ended up going onto the Mimcomsofts japanese website using google translate and sending a message in english through an automated contact form provided. I was surprised to find a response shortly after explaining that there is no warranty on XRGB Minis sold outside of Japan but gentleman in question promised to help. He offered to either send me replacement parts at no cost or to repair the unit if I sent it in. I chose to receive the replacement parts and offered to pay at least the shiping. He declined and I recieved the parts within the week.  I made the repairs and my XRGB mini works as good as new. All in all I was impressed by Mimcomsoft and the way they handled an issue they could have ignored.

5595950,0,t1_cwqoij8,Its meant to simulate the hardware of an original NES as precisely as possible. Its using an FPGA which is basically a chip that can be rewired electronically to turn itself into a different chip letting them reimplement the original NES hardware without needing inaccurate clone chips or needing to rip the chips out of original Nintendo hardware like Analogue NT does.They do have some extra features that theyve added like being able to tweak the video output scanlines for example or use GameGenie codes and the USB port can be used to upload high scores online but I dont see anything about save states or patches. Some flash carts might be able to do something like that and could be used in the AVS they could certainly run patched ROMs.The word seems to be that itll sell for under  without a controller they will have a wireless controller for extra and that they hope to have it released not long after Christmas.Im not a fan of the industrial design I think the console looks ugly but it looks to be a quality product that will end up being the easiestcheapest way to get accurate NES gaming on a modern display.

I want the most direct route from console to switch and switch to XRGBMini.    I will also be using a BNC to Din so that i can plug the switch directly to the XRGB without using scart.I have ordered my console wires to be with stripped audio cable and i ordered a batch of extron audio plug so i can plug the audio of the console cable directly to the extron .

The most I found was a Spanish speaking website most likely Mexican that sold a ton of CRT TVs. I would have never thought it but I think most of those old televisions made their ways to landfills once flat screens hit. It wasnt unheard of to inherit an older siblings TV and it be  years old. When flat screens hit everyone and his mother threw out their old CRT TVs.Good luck on finding one. I would try every thrift store you can or maybe even someone who deals in junk.

6801481,0,t3_48wp0t,I love my Sega CD but I dont think Id still own it if I couldnt burn games for it. When I got the console I wanted to buy some games but none of the local stores had any. I looked online and quickly discovered I could burn games. I burned a few random ones that sounded fun and loved most of them. I then looked up game prices online and went holy shit! I have a handful of real games but Ive come to accept that Ill never own some of my favorites. If I knew how expensive the best Sega CD or Saturn... games were I may never have bought the systems. Im glad I had no idea because Ive had a ton of fun with them anyway.I understand the argument that having the original game feels different on some level than using a CDR or flash cart. I agree and thats why some people still collect after they buy a flash cart. But as long as prices stay high some games are just inaccessible without them. Being able to play will always be more important than playing the right way.I dont have any flash carts. Id like to buy some but theyre a bit outside of my budget right now. Once I start wanting to play expensive NES or SNES games on real hardware I might change my mind.I frequently use emulation to try before I buy especially on more expensive games.

The only other thing you could do would be to rewire the setup to work with a controller board that can send the signal to USB. There are some pretty detailed instructions from others who have done it but it is really involved. If you have an old machine that you would want to dedicate to this you could run XP and most of the old stuff will work. Just be aware that it has massive security holes that are not ever going to be patched.

6982221,0,t3_4bbwrm,While I agree with most of his points I dont see anything wrong with the DuckTales Remastered release that came out a few years ago. I own it and enjoy it a lot. The added voice acting and visuals make it feel like another interpretation of the same material and Im okay with that. Sure Id love it if the disc came with the original NES version as well but I have that on cartridge form already.gt Every other industry repackages its content. Games should too. I totally agree with this. Im not saying that every game should be in print and heck some are public domain at this point anyway but I find it strange that Nintendo doesnt just dump all its first party games onto the VC or Sony with all its PS games. Little Samson is pirated to the hilt these days but Taito which owned by Square Enix doesnt seem to have any interest in putting an emulated version on a modern console to get a piece of that pie. I suspect that its because they dont want older games to compete with newer games since they are much cheaper.

7019436,0,t3_4bs3s3,uCheezitsAreMyLife gave a good answer regarding the legality of what youre asking. Honestly its a pretty gray area of law. Anyway a pretty common setup for retro gaming is to set up a computer with a variety of emulators and install a frontend program. The computer can boot right into the frontend which is basically a menu where you can pick which system and which game to play and the frontend launches the correct emulator. There are usbBluetooth  controllers available that are reproductions of the retro controllers. Hook up some of those and its just like youre playing on an old console.Edit also I recommend against the raspberry pi if youre going to use it strictly for gaming. Its a great little computer but struggles with some snes games and wont run most n games anything earlier is good. Its ideal if size is a concern since its tiny.,retrogaming,d1c044i,1,t5_2qk6v

7119867,0,t3_4d1m1d,I find it refreshing to see more and more posts like this. Of course its unfortunate to see people who want to play these games are priced out of owning them. Video games are not baseball cards. Right now far too many games are being bought up by people who have no intention or care to ever play them. Emulation is fantastic. Flash carts are great but expensive. I use a mixture of everything. Ive got a genesis and an everdrive. Its great. I also have a famiclone with the in multicart. That has been cheap and awesome. I also have an old laptop that can emulate pretty well almost everything up through the th generation. Occosionally I also buy PS games on PSN.

7649531,0,t1_d3aurfa, When I worked there they let me take a couple of promotional items. I have some promo sheets for Doom for MK. The game boxes were unused still folded into their flat positions as they were shipped the promotional stuff I have I think was for a releases for stores distributors. I wish I hadnt toss the promotional stand up for Doom but it wasnt in great shape after a few moves over the years. Lol I dont know why Doom does that we didnt test the game past what you would see on the console and its earlier incarnations. I wasnt really happy with the translation from PC to console and when there were no codes released I told them it wouldnt be a good sale. I want to say I read a few years ago there are codes.Besides playing games we answered phones from gamers wanting codes strategies or occasional hour long conversations of gamers trying to push their made up characters for MK. Like we had any sway. Some people would call and just talk. Oh our phone number was NOT an  number. We had one kid who called just about every day then one day he told us he couldnt call anymore because his dad got the phone bill. That conversation was like three hours. lol,retrogaming,d3bpjpe,2,t5_2qk6v

7915744,0,t1_d42sg3k,As someone whos recently done a bit of a personal Castlevania marathon including beating several of the classic titles for the first time heres a little more food for thought.The classic linearbased entries and the PS Symphony of the Night titles on up are essentially different games. They share the same trappings but operate completely differently. Any of the postSymphony of the Night titles are fun actionRPG romps and you may as well start with the PS title  but  theyre easy. Really easy. The fun is in the presentation and taking pleasure in how much you can beef up your character. If youre into that check them out.The older titles which I prefer might be your introduction into difficult games and theyd be a good one. Timing and trialanderror strategizing are key but between unlimited continues and the sheer fun of their mechanics it all makes for a satisfying experience with steady progress. The original Castlevania NES or Rondo of Blood JPN only most easily available on Wiis Virtual Console are both excellent places to start with achievable learning curves and only a few bottleneck points enough to give you the satisfaction of beating a hard game if you decide to see them through. Castlevania III my personal favorite is also among the hardest games Ive ever played so save it for once youve gotten the core mechanics down.Super Castlevania IV is a fun game in its own right and easier than other entries but it breaks away from the thoughtful mechanics that make the other classic titles so devious and rewarding. Im sure you can find more detailed discussions about this but essentially you have a longer reach with your whip and can attack in any direction trivializing a lot of situations that would have presented challenges in other titles. In addition the level design and bosses are just generally easier. Some love it Im not among them.,retrogaming,d45sz9s,2,t5_2qk6v

DKC had saves and you will want it! DKC is not super hard but it can be a tad hard if youve never played it. DKC is harder DKC is hard in its own way too. Personally when i get pissed off at a SNES game I go play a good bemup like Power Rangers or Super Double Dragon. Then at least I can take my frustration out. ,retrogaming,d4ja8bb,1,t5_2qk6v

8281553,0,t3_4swnfy,Taking this more seriously . . .Maybe articulate why you dont like these games as most are some of the best in their category.Mario RPG is more of a beginners introduction to RPGs maybe not quite as good as what fallowed Paper Mario  is fantastic but I enjoyed the different take on Mario and was a better beginners RPG than FF Mystic Quest.I have not played much of the Oracles but I liked them so far. Its a strange bridge between LttP and OoT Makes sense it was released between the I just played through Super Metorid recently and Loved it with maybe the Moon Jump being the only pain later on in the game.What games DO you like? Maybe retro gaming or at least these genres are not for you.Zelda OOT on the N is a bit of a rough experience I did not like it much during my playthrough Its a great historical peice as its one of the first of its kind but I prefer Majoras Mask.Maybe to join in on knocking down popular games . . .I do not like the Donkey Kong Country trilogy much to me they are a lot of pizzazz without much substance. Level design just feels a bit bland to me and the controls are not the most tight when it comes to attacking. Its ok but I rather play other platformers.And I guess Zelda OoT has not aged well its ok but I feel like the hype around it killed it for me when I was playing it as the problems seemed to stick out more. Majoras Mask fixes some issues And I like it better but it brings new problems. I feel there is a great game between them but nether are perfect.I realy want to love Zelda  NES but the stiff controls kill it a bit. I still enjoy it but I would love a modern remake like Metroid got.Its hard to go back to Super Mario Kart after starting with Mario Kart  and Double Dash!!.I dont like most fighting games except Smash and I think Dead or Alive I played it over a friends house and had fun Im just not a competitive gamer.,retrogaming,d5cr4nb,2,t5_2qk6v
8281789,0,t1_d5cqzj8,I prefer Perfect Dark over GoldenEye there is a ROM hack though that brings GoldenEye to the Perfect Dark engine which is quite nice not sure when it will be completed however. Banjo Kazooie is nice but I prefer Banjo Tooie much more I would play Tooie over Kazooie. Never played Donkey Kong  but I heard that game does not have any walls in it.Not really into fighting games at all the only one I have ever really had an interest in would be Killer Instinct for the SNES.Also happy cake day!,retrogaming,d5cs6yo,1,t5_2qk6v

But the mini isnt going to be any better.On the second point your ideal option would be component video which many CRTs support. If your CRT supports that just grab the HD Retrovision SNES component cables when they go back on sale in the very near future. Theyre the simplest possible option you just plug them into your SNES and your TV. Theyre converting from RGB to component with a little board embedded in the cable so they dont require any power or other connection and they dont require any tweaking they just work. They originally said the second batch would arrive in late August but it seems like they might be behind schedule.Another option for component is to get a standalone converter box. The CSY clones go for around  and youll need a SNES RGB SCART cable to connect to it. You may need to open up the converter and play with the potentiometers on the board to tweak the colours as the clones are often not quite right out of the box. This option overall will cost you a bunch more than the HDR cables since youll need both the SCART cable and the converter and a component cable and its a bit messier since it requires external power but it will work.If your TV doesnt support component video or even the HD Retrovision cables are too expensive for you they were  USD plus shipping when the first batch was sold then a CRT will still look quite good with svideo. Its still a big improvement over composite. Getting the right svideo cable is important the rule of thumb is avoid any cable that also has composite video you want an svideo cable that ONLY has svideo and audio obviously.I bought this cable which is pretty cheap . USD free shipping to Canada . shipping to US and it works wellwww.ebay.comitmThebestSvideocableforNintendoSNESNGameCubeSvideoSVHSmftIts not a super heavy duty ultra shielded cable so its not immune to external interference but if you place it properly it will work perfectly its a great value.,retrogaming,d6yefnm,1,t5_2qk6v

I believe they are the DSeries models.  It did have perfect geometry and very nice colors but the one I checked out had really bad black crush and I didnt know how to fix it so I passed on the set.  Sometimes older sets have this issue.  I had a Trinitron model that had this problem.  However I have recently owned two different model JVC IArt CRTs and they both had perfect geometry.

If I can tell theyve got the wrong platform labeled from the thumbnail they should be able to identify it in person. I think the bigger issue is that a lot of the people selling arent even aware that other platforms exist and just assume that anything that comes on floppies must be a DOS title.I do also occasionally come across people who cant tell the difference between . and . floppies so just looking different doesnt guarantee that theyll get it right.More forgivable but still funny I recently saw a listing that described the CDs for Wing Commander  as DVDs which would be impressive considering the game is from .,retrogaming,dab9564,1,t5_2qk6v

Check out Anyhow heres a photo of my setup Hardware RGB Modded N  Japanese RGB Modded AV Famicom NES   Japanese. Installed the NESRGB board. RGB Modded Super Famicom Jr  Japanese. Installed RGB mod and installed a digital audio circuit and optical sound output. Mega Drive   Japanese  Outputs RGB natively but I have modded it to add a region switch at the back which allows me to play all games from any region at hz full screen no borders Sega Saturn  Japanese  Ive installed a modchip and a region free bios. PSOne  PAL  Outputs RGB natively. Installed a modchip to allow backups and games from all regions to be played. XBOX Original  PAL  GB HDD installed custom firmware console set to output at p on the main dashboard and the maximum resolution for each game. Connected via component to the OSSC and linedoubling turned on for it ie. games like Wolfenstein play in p.Every single one of the above mods was done by myself. They range from simple Super Famicom Jr RGB mod Mega Drive region mod to the ridiculously difficult NESRGB  I had to desolder the original PPU chip fit numerous boards together solder  points install a palette switch. The benefit was aside from honing my soldering and electronic skills was saving money. That NES cost me just over  console two pads nesrgb installation. If I had bought it on ebay premodded itd cost  easily.  I use two SCART switches of the HAMA brand hooked up together. They work fine. Audio is taken from a phono breakout to my . amp which works fine with surround sound on the games that support it SNES titles like Tales of Phantasia and Star Ocean many N games etc. Optical audio is taken from the Super Famicoms new digital output I installed.Everything is run through the OSSC scaler to my  HDTV in linetriple p mode or higher if using the xbox.

10064887,0,t1_dbjgghj,Im going to jump in and say that the AVS is awesome. Every NES game is upscaled to p p X  so still pixel perfect. There is no additional lag so it is all dependent on the input lag of your TV. It accepts any hardware that was designed for the NES or Famicom with the exception of the zapper due to how it was designed to interact with CRT televisions so you can use your powerpad NES advantage the Vaus controller for Arkanoid the Uforce Famicom Disk System etc.On top of that the coolest feature of all is the scoreboard. Most games that have a high score also have the ability to sync to a server hosted by Nintendoage to compete with other AVS users. Each cartridge is verified by the system to not have any hacks or cheats so that everyone that is uploading a high score is using the exact same game.Speaking of cheats the AVS has a built in GameGenie with popular codes for each game built in. If you have a game genie book you can also use any of those codes as well.I considered modding my NES but the AVS is absolutely everything I want. The only negative I saw was the price of  USD...But honestly this was independently designed developed manufactured and is getting updates that increase functionality regularly. There is love and care in this system and that combined with being a quality product it was a no brainer for me to support it.Although currently sold out the second run is being produced and can be preordered for  at retrousb.com,retrogaming,dbjh839,4,t5_2qk6v

10310672,0,t3_5njx9e,You mention N games looking particularly awful on cheap scalers and I have to echo that.  An upscaler which doesnt handle p correctly which is essentially  of scalers youll see offered by major retailers really tends to screw up the transparency effects which were by that era commonplace.  So you get transparencies which permanently display every other line of the sprite or do not display at all or that sort of thing.  And fairly bad lag of course.  As is said here time and time again the only  solution really is a Framemeister or OSSC the latter being unavailable for immediate order and quite rare on the resale market.  A couple other less well known Micomsoft upscalers XPC XRGB also do the trick but are less intuitive and suited to this particular application than the Framemeister.    Though the UltraHDMI mod is now a systemspecific solution for N itself.  ,retrogaming,dccrr8t,3,t5_2qk6v

10368740,0,t3_5odx5n,I love discussing repros.Heres my take. You have to ask yourself some more questions before you can get a direct answer to your original question. Did you repro an unmodified ROM of a game that was commercially available either here in the USA or otherwise? Yep thats basically piracy and is illegal. Its illegal whether you make the cart look legit or not but obviously gamers amp collectors frown upon repro labels. Personally I dont have a problem with repro labels but then again I treat my games as entertainment and not as an investment unlike most modern collectors. Thats another huge separate argument. P Did you repro a fan translationROM hack? The patch itself isnt illegal and if you own the game its based on I suppose you could make the argument that you modified your own personal backup copy to make the ROM hack. But youd still need the source ROM and you could also argue that this too is piracy unless you own a physical copy of the game. Did you repro a prototypeunreleased ROM? A lot of people are OK with this morallyethically since the company isnt making any money off it now and they probably never did but youre still essentially stealing another companys intellectual property that they did not intend the public to see. I could even see them making the argument that releasing an unfinished potentially bad unreleased game tarnishes the reputation of the programmers publishers and the IP.TLDR Yeah theyre probably all illegal but the big companies just turn a blind eye because its not worth the legal hassle.EDIT I should have prefaced my post with this Selling repros for a profit regardless of source is WAY illegal. Theyre just gambling on the companies who own the IPs not giving a shit.,retrogaming,dcjcx9w,5,t5_2qk6v

10372958,0,t3_5ojki2,Its one of those cases where there isnt really much of a market because there isnt really a financial justification.  A loose Mega Drive Model  is worth around  dollars.  Basically paying someone anything to repair it doesnt make sense unless it has a mod which contributes to its value.  Repairing ones own system can be its own reward.  But its hard to see the financial sense in paying a professional to undertake basic repair on an unmodded or unsuccessfully modded system.  Even a loose NonTMSS HD Graphics Model  Genesis is only worth maybe .  So basically I just wouldnt bother with an unsuccessfully modded Mega Drive Model  or a defective Model .  Because starting from square one is going to be less trouble than getting someone to investigate a failed mod.

Had to go on a scavenger hunt finding the console in a box underneath the house with the power supply. Had to scavenge half my PSPs power cord to make it work. My composite cable was in my closet in a box of random unsorted wires. The tv unfortunately had no remote but required it to change input. Finally found a modern universal remote and spent an hour or two trying different codes. Finally one worked! After all that time and tearing the entire house apart on my quixotic quest it all worked like a charm! Next to fix my NES...So heres the best question is this RCA Truflat tv a good one or a bad one?

11265434,0,t3_60rzv6,Im assuming by RGB you mean Component and not SCART. Despite the connectors being colored red green and blue Component is actually YPbPr and not RGB.Some TVs have a component connection that serves double duty as Composite. Check to see if one of the video jacks probably the green one is labeled video circled or otherwise called out separately from the rest.A handful of new TVs actually have a miniplug composite jack for some reason. Cheaper I suppose. If your TV has one of those you just need the right cable.If your TV absolutely does not have Composite video there are adapters on the market.That said it should be noted that even if you get it to read the signal a lot of modern TVs have issues with signals from older game consoles. Modern TVs generally either cant handle the video signal at all or mangle it a bit due to most older games using a purposefully malformed i signal referred to as p.

This physically bends the pins so over time they stop working.With rd party ones since they already knew about this design flaw they shape the pins so that they connect with the leads without needing to be pushed down. That way they should work for the rest of time because the push down action is removed.This is also where the idea of blowing in your carts to make them work comes from.

Nintendo wanted absolute control over those they licensed to make games for their console. This is partially understandable given the glut of awful games that contributed to the earlier crash but other aspects like their censorship of material and moral code were more controversial. This led to some important and interesting challenges to Nintendo such as Tengen cartridges.
