190824,0,t3_1wa9v3,I would definitely try compound movements such as squats bench press deadlifts and rows. All can be done with the barbell. Make sure whatever gym you sign up to has a power rack or at least a squat rack. Do not use a smiths machine as this does more damage than good as it only allows you to move in one straight line and therefore you dont work any of your balance muscles. I would go three times a week mon wed Fri and rest in the days in between. Start with an empty bar and do five sets of five reps. Check out stronglifts x workout on youtube. Its the one i use at the moment. no affiliation its just the one that works for me its a great work out and will make you nice and strong. Make sure you get your diet in check. Plenty of protein vegetables and healthy fats. Stay away from white carbs as they will mess you up. look up paleo diet or Tim ferrisss slow carb diet. Also at the beginning you want to focus more on building the habit of going to the gym and not go full out and get demotivated. In the beginning always leave wanting to do more. Like even if you go for  minutes  times a week for  weeks then up it to  minutes for the next  weeks ect. The point being that once you work it up to a full exercise session the habit will have been formed so strong that you wont be able to not go to the gym. Hope this helps!,workout,cf06ar0,1,t5_2rir8

7294511,0,t3_4f7fo7,You need to focus on your diet if your goal is to lose fat. in terms of working out you can start with power walking first if running is too exhausting. Sometimes if you mix running with walking it can eventually improve your endurance. Weight training will do wonders for toning up and losing fat. ,workout,d27c4gy,1,t5_2rir8

10172127,0,t3_5lntfp,After spending lots of time working out in hot and cold I would say I prefer working in the cold. While working in heat I find I cannot drink enough water to be properly hydrated and so my body tends to hold more water weight  just my experience anyway ,workout,dbx2eqa,1,t5_2rir8
11254321,0,t3_60kaf9,I have been constantly training for more than  years for now. Over the years I have tried many different supplements and nutritional complexes so further approval is based on a purely personal experience. Absolutely all sports supplements can be useful only for experienced athletes and only during periods of limiting the total calorie content of your diet. The turnover of sports supplements has long exceeded a billion dollars and most of the studies that prove the use of the protein shake after training are actually farfetched. In fact the socalled proteincarbohydrate window is open at least a full day after your workout. Therefore Do not hurry to eat after your workout. Give your preference to freshly prepared homemade foods and I guarantee you an excellent increase in strength and muscle mass.IMHO,workout,df7ns67,1,t5_2rir8
