3031883,0,t1_coc8fht,Previously mls teams played mid April to late June. They are now scheduled to play in JuneJuly for the next  seasons. There are  a number of reasons why they did itWWC was just one  another was to give lower division teams like Edmonton and Ottawa more time to preparegiven that they were basically starting their season with these games as well as making space for regional league champions who would otherwise would have to play in match to compete. I cant seem to find an article from last year that explained it all but walking the red has this is their post todaygtThat shift was made to allow for the Voyageurs Cup competition to make a shift in to the summer months and eventually expand the competition field.gtThe changes to the scheduling will certainly be a welcome move for the MLS clubs as they will now have less fixture congestion to deal with early in the summer. For TFC even a return to claiming the title would only mean adding two addition games in May and two more in August which is certainly manageable.,CanadaSoccer,coc93ru,3,t5_2sf14
3200430,0,t1_cotpuyr,the quality of play would be so poor compared to what MLS can offer I think our division two needs to be around  teams if were not tied into the NASL. There is plenty of room for growth but to get the investment we need success and the only way to get that at a decent rate is MLS,CanadaSoccer,cotq2qo,3,t5_2sf14
3358242,0,t3_2ykit3,Im wondering if well see more players from the NASL cap for the MNT than MLS this year since Canucks play more often at that level.,CanadaSoccer,cpb2bw6,2,t5_2sf14
