1362745,0,t1_cin3cle,Let me add that the USS Nathan James in this episode has a hull number of DDG which means it is part of the last ones to be ordered as the new Flight III of Arleigh Burke class destroyers. This is good news as this flight has much better mine ballistic missile and NBC nuclear biological chemical protection. However does anyone think that the nuclear prep the crew did was anywhere close to realistic?While one of the ASW helos has been lost to make room for the lab I guess we have to suck it up. Anyone else expect to see the Phalanx CIWS do the following to those Russian helicopters?,TheLastShip,cin3yd4,2,t5_304la
1392667,0,t1_ciqudnu,Actually all of the uniforms portrayed in this show at least with the US Navy are completely accurate. Most are a lot cleaner than youd see after a deployment but hey gotta look good for TV. The only thing made up has been the ships name.,TheLastShip,ciquoct,2,t5_304la

5037092,0,t1_cut56ec,Yes they could probably find plenty for her to do if they decide to keep her around.  However it seems to me the focus of the show is shifting away from just fighting a disease toward rebuilding civilization as a whole.  Dr. Scotts role in that wouldnt be as central so if theyre ever going to kill her off now would be the time.  ,TheLastShip,cut5t66,2,t5_304la
5040626,0,t3_3jx5ak,Sigh is there really need for a third season? It looks like theyre just milking a dead horse while beating it. This show could easily have been completed with one season and while I can sorta get behind the second season pushing a conflict in the last  seconds of the last episode just to make a new season is absurd. I mean they have a contagious cure they sank the Ramseys pretty much beat the immunes... theres really no need for another season.,TheLastShip,cutl4gy,-4,t5_304la

7961790,0,t3_4o8o3b,If anything it was more realistic than the huge fireballs they get from using gas bombs.  Grenades dont explode into huge balls of fire they bang like a pipe bomb and throw out shrapnel that cuts through the body.  ,TheLastShip,d4azbgu,2,t5_304la

8708420,0,t3_4z3u84,I have to respectfully disagree with your Chandler as President hope. To me that would take the show too far.  Incharacter Chandler is a great leader but hes a tactical one. Hes no politician.  From a show mechanics perspective it is also too convenient. Like they establish this character from he beginning so he has to be the choice for POTUS?  Also technically we havent seen anything that would make me think the current President couldnt be decent. He wasnt involved in the coup and has been issuing orders under duress.  ,TheLastShip,d6u6sam,4,t5_304la

8770469,0,t1_d70on3a,I didnt like how that was in there.  It added nothing and made no sense.  They cant kill her this early because the regional leaders wouldnt be able to coup properly without her as their gobetween why have her in the scene at all?  Ditto them breaking cover BEFORE destroying the rest of the chinese guards.  Behind the jeeps it makes sense that they lose no one but at point blank range in a wide open area there was no way they wouldnt lose anyone.,TheLastShip,d71z26x,8,t5_304la

8912822,0,t1_d7j4qwr,Im glad Im not the only one.I understand she was a major character but they gave us so much resolution on all the major plot points that it didnt feel very cliffhangery to me. Maybe it speaks to the more action and story driven nature of the series which isnt to say the character development is lacking especially for what the show is or maybe Im just a bit of a sociopath but I felt like Rachels story was largely finished at that point and it didnt bother me to not know whether she retired and lived happily ever after or died or went on to have new adventures.,TheLastShip,d7j6vq6,3,t5_304la
