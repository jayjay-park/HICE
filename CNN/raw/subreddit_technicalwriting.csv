Depending on the topic I might have one person review my work but in some cases I might have to pick and choose sections that I will send around to different Subject Matter Experts SME to be sure of an accurate and userfriendly document. If I email it I often hear nothing. Again depending on the situation I might chase an SME down and stand over them while they make their changes. By then Ive usually read the document  times and cant see my own typos. So what I try to do in the last edit is output a draft as PDF and transfer it to my smart phone. If I read it on there before bed I usually find my typos. I take screenshots of the pages and make my corrections in the morning.Its a sloppy process but it gets results. I am a tech writer but I also sometimes get asked to do deep edits to existing docs.,technicalwriting,cjbrpzn,1,t5_2vm20

6720095,0,t1_d0eb2x3,Yeah I guess thats all Im saying lol. I think its mostly that I ended up interviewing before I had much to show for myself. I dont think I came on too strong in the interview. I will make a point in future interviews to talk about how I think I will learn and grow in the position though.,technicalwriting,d0eezhw,1,t5_2vm20

7335915,0,t1_d2b49pk,Ahhh yes! Thank you! I totally agree! Since Ive put aside my ignorance about Word and started actually learning how to use it Im positively ADDICTED! It can do so much cool stuff if only you just work with it a bit and learn what it can do. I am definitely interested in studying for that cert I cant wait what other neat stuff I can learn,technicalwriting,d2c1k85,2,t5_2vm20

8629170,0,t3_4xygne,STC membership in general has gone down the tubes. I signed up this summer after being laid off and am astounded at the dearth of information. I paid extra for two SIGs both of which have ZERO content. Sadly theres a no refunds policy. I was a member when I was a student at ASU  years ago. There was a ton of information at that time and the salary survey which is all but inaccessible now was amazing and detailed. There were real jobs in the job listings. There were real events at the local chapter. Now all the phoenix chapter does is things on meetup.com like hiking. I dont want to go hiking with other tech writers sorry! I want to network with them and pick their brains. I wont be renewing thats for sure. I can spend the same money on a class at the local CC to learn something new that can benefit me in my career or a new hobby. ,technicalwriting,d6k91ol,4,t5_2vm20
8984923,0,t3_51zyre,Unless youre an extreme introvert i.e. has trouble talking to cashiers at stores to make basic purchases I think youll do just fine. Technical writing does involve alot of communication  one of the main functions of the job is asking people questions about their work so you can document it. But because theres a pretty clear topic of conversation so long as youre comfortable enough to be able to ask those questions the social interaction takes care of itself. Its not as if youre trying to make small talk with your SMEs. Quite the opposite in fact  lots of people will appreciate if you dont waste their time in your interviewsmeetings and cut to the chase ,technicalwriting,d7rulpq,1,t5_2vm20

9584468,0,t3_5c84yt,I did this at my last employer. A few things . Dont reinvent the wheel. I used two things to help me get started the Microsoft Manual of Style and the OReilly Stylesheet and Word List These should get you  of the way there because these are tried and true resources. . Pay attention to the words and phrases common in your industry and stick with those. I created a word list with common words and acronyms that were in use both inside the company and by our main vendors. If you are in a regulated industry such as banking or healthcare there may be very strict usage guidelines as to what something actually means so make sure you are aware of that. At one point I worked for a healthcare subsidiary of a large multinational and they had a five page guide with very strict rules about how and when to capitalize or not capitalize various product names and services. In the end I created a Style Guide with typography and font conventions and a Word List. The Style Guide specified things like file names always being italic and Linux commands always being monospaced bold because those were the conventions that everyone was already used to from years of looking at OReilly books. The Word List had entries for things like Tomcat n and tomcat service because those were the conventions specified by the vendor. If you keep those kinds of things in mind this wont be too daunting a task. Oh and just go ahead and accept the fact that no one but you will ever use the style guide. ,technicalwriting,d9uhc0q,7,t5_2vm20
