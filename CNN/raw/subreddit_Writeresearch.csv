3165140,0,t3_2r8fg5,As a criminal justice graduate who currently works with minors i can say that she would probably enter some kind of residential treatment program if only to help her process the fact that she had committed such an act at such a young age. In this circumstance which isnt entirely specific they would most likely not charge her as as adult. They would however err on the side of caution on terms of her sentencing for basically damage control. This type of event is hugely traumatic for a young child to experience and to not properly address it would be negligible. I deal with plenty of kids in the same age area on a daily basis who have been convicted of attempted murder in situations much like youre describing. The most important element in that equation is to make sure they know the wrongs and rights of the situation. Its also very important to make sure they properly process the emotions surrounding the event. A decent example of this type of scenario is the case of Mary Bell who was deemed a serial killer at age . She was convicted and sentenced to a residential treatment program wherein they helped to rationalize the idea of life and its importance. She was released at age  and became a productive member of society. Children are a protected commodity within the legal system most times due to their perceived lack of understanding and foresight. Even in the most horrific scenarios a child will receive at worst juvenile life which means they will remain in some form of in patient treatment program until  in some cases  but there are quite a few variables involved with that. In summation with the circumstances youve described the child would probably receive a sentence of anywhere from  years of residential treatment with the stipulation that her clinicians deem her suitable to reenter society.,Writeresearch,coq2dg4,2,t5_34i7v

10130109,0,t3_5kzh56,I was working as a nonLEO Park Ranger in conjunction with LEO Rangers and responded to a few threats attempts and suicides. Here is what I know. Someone calls in that someone acting suspicious crying angry may have verbally threatened suicide etc.. We would respond taking great care when approaching the suspect. At this point we have no idea what is going on. We dont know if the person is armed suicidal homicidal etc. So we approach with caution making verbal connection as soon as possible and trying to immediately deescalate the situation. If the person is hostile it can end badly. Guns will be drawn and suicide by cop can occur quickly and easily. If the person has a knife razor poison etc. the response can also be aggressive if that is the quickest way to end the situation.. If the person is not openly threatening themselves or others we would talk. Try to gauge the situation. Figure out a little bit about the person. Calm them. Deescalate the situation until they are calm enough to reason. I have seen someone who was seconds away from lighting himself on fire in his gasoline covered truck kind snap out of it after just a little talking.. After the person has been calmed they will be transported willingly or unwillingly to the nearby hospital where they are put on observation and a doctor will decide wether they should be admitted or not. Thats where my experience ends.. There is a lot of paperwork and the officer is holding someone against their will without an actual arrest or charge. Not sure the specifics as I only had to fill out my observational reports. But they can be held against their will for up to I think  hours until the doctor makes the decision to hold them.My involvement in most of these type scenarios was secondary secure the scene get anyone not involved away from the scene direct traffic radio dispatch etc. I was only directly involved in a few.,Writeresearch,dbryisv,1,t5_34i7v

11106346,0,t3_5yjo34,As for the British Navy any crimes committed on shore COULD be tried as if they we on ship as outlined in Articles  amp  of the Articles of War.Realistically it mattered where the crime occurred and the severity of the crime. Most misdemeanor type crimes would have most likely been handed over to the ship for punishment especially if they occurred in a provincial port. By misdemeanor type crimes I mean drunkenness brawls military crimes such as dereliction of duty desertion etc. Major crimes especially against civilians would likely be tried in an English court of law for example The soldiers of the Boston massacre were tried by an English court in Boston. This could also mean the sailor would be imprisoned in their ship for the remainder of the tour and tried when the vessel reached a port with a English court.So it varied greatly. I am not really sure of how other navies handled it. My knowledge mostly comes from an amateur obsession with the Patrick OBrien and C.S. Forrester books which lead me to reading a variety of nonfiction on the subject.The Royal Navy Articles of War You should readbrowse them all but  amp  pertain to crimes committed on shore. Punishments in the Royal Navy during American Revolution follows three ships and the punishments over a period of several years. Not quite what you need but gives an idea. ,Writeresearch,deqw80f,2,t5_34i7v
