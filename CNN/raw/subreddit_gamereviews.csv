2770048,0,t3_2rswit,So today I found out that Duke Nukem had a brother a brother that dressed far more metrostylish than Duke ever did. His name is Dynamite Duke and hes here to kick gum and chew ass!waitis that how he says it?Anyway its a old Sega Genesis game that by all means should have been a light gun game though I do have to comend them for trying something different even if its barely used.The only major issues I have with the game are the controls which are hard to get used to and the lack of enemy varietySomething common in early Genesis games. I also find the lack of different guns to be a bit of a downer but given the mechanics behind the dodging ducking and melee systems might have been difficult to implement.Sound effects are a little weak as well the gun just sounds like a fast typewriter and some of the explosions sound like someone punching and empty plastic toteAll that said the games still kind of fun in short bursts. I just wouldnt pay a lot for it.,gamereviews,cniy01a,1,t5_2qo03
3698496,0,t1_cqdrpzr,I just finished watching your Sunshine analysis and I can say that that video was more in line with the kind of video I would like to produce. I see what you mean about the story summary aspect and in the future videos I wont be summarizing the story like that anymore. Rather Ill focus on how the story is told because its a problem throughout the series imo and how it holds up because it becomes a clusterfuck late in the series.As far as distancing myself from matthewmatosis Im going to try to let future videos develop a unique style but its hard. Ill probably spend more time with the script writing process in the future because the script I wrote for this video went through almost no major revisions and that may not have been the best way to do it.Thanks so much for the detailed feedback and I hope you will be able to give me some feedback on the next video in the series. Also I see you havent made a video in  months which is sad. Id love to see a continuation of your D Mario series. Even though matthewmatosis already covered the series and theres a bit of overlap Id like to see what you can bring to the table as well.,gamereviews,cqduq7c,1,t5_2qo03
