9496682,0,t1_d9jm6bs,When you pay a lot for a license its in your best interest to use it as much as possible. Besides none of the posters currently sitting in their shop are from any franchise theyve already thoroughly covered so somebody is buying them up.  My guess is that will stay true tomorrow.,Mondo,d9jo2ee,5,t5_2t87f

11554399,0,t1_dg4tzkq,Custom framing is the way to go. UV glass is essential and you want everything to be archival. A big issue with off the shelf frames is that the wood is high in acid content and will turn the edges of the print yellow. ,Mondo,dg5p0zd,1,t5_2t87f
