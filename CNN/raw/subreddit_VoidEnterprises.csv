He shows his boss this. For the first time in his life Mr. Delirium feels pity. He does a mercy kill on Mr. The Void but not without a oneliner because hes still an ass.,VoidEnterprises,dcojwps,5,t5_3ilws

Post it on Reddit and maybe itll get way more popular than you expected and youll end up running an askblog.  PI mean thats basically how Void Enterprises came to be. My brain came up with Mr. Delirium then Mr. The Void and then my brain went Wait these characters dont make any sense. So I said Then lets MAKE them make sense!,VoidEnterprises,dcth3qo,3,t5_3ilws
