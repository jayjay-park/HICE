642476,0,t1_cgd6gn1,I tried this today I had to do my run today because Im going away this weekend and wouldnt be able to fit in three in the week if I didnt my overall pace was slightly slower but I did run a lot more of the free run then I had previously. I really wanted to manage the first three mins of the free run without stopping I tried and I think I might have been able to but I got a stitch just before the ten min free run started and so it kind of made it a bit harder! Managed  mins though and because I ran slower I could made my walking intervals shorter. Think I ran about  mins of the free run which is my best yet! Thanks for the advice. Also I wore my mums Nike Air Trainers instead of my like tennis shoes and wow it was so much nicer! Definitely going to buy some proper shoes soon!,runner5k,cgdat8s,2,t5_2x6x0

1152402,0,t3_26yljj,A bit late on this one though it seems to match up with when I usually post training wise. Just ran the first of week  today after getting off track by a bit. Thought I could throw in an easy fun run to listen to a podcast but that kind of upset my rhythm and it took me a bit to get back into the pattern.,runner5k,chz9d4o,2,t5_2x6x0
1247799,0,t1_ci9ra9z,Yes I did! I think Ill be finishing the app without music.I do notice that I seem to be drawn in more to the app and story but it hasnt been too creepy in the k app. When I go for walks with the zombie chases on radio Abel its awesomely creepy though. ,runner5k,ci9zr81,2,t5_2x6x0
1390778,0,t1_cipuho9,Aw thats rubbish about your insole.  Glad your runs are going well apart from that.,runner5k,ciqm5ln,1,t5_2x6x0
1398157,0,t1_cirhubm,Thanks thanks! I guess youre right and I shouldnt push myself just yet. ,runner5k,cirjfu7,1,t5_2x6x0
1570903,0,t1_cjac3pa,Youre not supposed to run straight through the freeforms! Thats why theyre freeformsto let you improve at your own pace.I wasnt getting through the freeforms until week . I wouldnt worry about repeating a week unless you cant make it through the drills.Listen to the Doc run when you can walk when you have to and run again when you can.The final mission is actually easier than the stuff leading up to it because youre not tiring yourself out with all the other exercises!,runner5k,cjd6pun,2,t5_2x6x0
1786365,0,t1_ck2fiws,I might have!!  Just did   another crash. I caught it this time though,runner5k,ck4bohk,1,t5_2x6x0

1947835,0,t3_2gyoik,I was going to finish Week  today but I am SICK.  criesBut yesterday a friend and I were trying to meet up and got confused about where.  I ran after him for about  seconds in work clothes.  No problem no sweat.  Doin it right!,runner5k,cknx0t7,3,t5_2x6x0
2062002,0,t3_2ib2q1,Did WD which was really strange because I achieved the fabulous achievement of running more than walking standard and freeform runs  seconds walking  minute running.,runner5k,cl1xbx0,3,t5_2x6x0
2182039,0,t1_clggwfk,Yeah! Youve got this!,runner5k,clh6urj,3,t5_2x6x0
2210287,0,t1_clkqxxn,Totally thought it was deliberate! But yes a really good way to show that we can run longer than we thought!,runner5k,clks51b,3,t5_2x6x0
2234434,0,t1_clntxl4,No problem. After you download the app it should be easy to see what is involved with each weeks workouts or theres a link to the full workout plan in the subs sidebar. Some weeks involve extra stretching or activities like skipping which will probably help your recovery too. Oh FYI the first mission is pretty much a repeat of the first mission in the main ZR app so either skip it or just listen to it while youre doing something else or walking it has no runwalk prompts. ,runner5k,clnumbl,3,t5_2x6x0

3425382,0,t3_2zgo7g,Hard won knowledge those heel lifts knee lifts squats and skipping drills make an amazing difference in your running form amp in preventing injury. I remember getting up extra early for my runs with the skipping drills so that I would have less of an audience doing drills that I figured looked pretty silly. Ive since had military folk tell me that skipping forward amp backwards is a regular part of their training drills and recently ran across this video featuring skipping drills by Olympian amp marathon man Meb Keflezighi Dont feel silly and dont skip those drills!,runner5k,cpipvtu,4,t5_2x6x0
3677765,0,t3_32idui,I dont think you necessarily need to go back and do it.  Its mostly just an introduction to the story and a freeform run.  Its the same story in the beginning of the regular Zombies Run app so if you plan to continue on to that once you graduate from the k I would just wait till then. ,runner5k,cqbhmbk,2,t5_2x6x0

3937725,0,t3_351z1q,Hey there! Im  running in NYC. Im signed up for my first k in September so I knew I needed to start training. Last year I tried the official CK and made it to day  before dropping it. Im now on Week  W and loving it! I get so immersed into the story. I ran  mins straight today could have gone longer but I was with a friend who forgot his headphones and kept making me laugh . W W had me winded after the  seconds. I cant wait to keep going and reach k!!,runner5k,cr54vho,2,t5_2x6x0
3966637,0,t1_cr83q6a,If youre like me youre probably running those faster because hey its only a minute.,runner5k,cr8fide,2,t5_2x6x0
4129187,0,t1_crq9ba8,In addition to what others have said make sure you have decent shoes that are not worn out.  I found that I started getting leg pain when my shoes wore out but that it went away when I got new shoes.  ,runner5k,crqy9e3,1,t5_2x6x0
4955536,0,t1_cuj37d6,Thanks! That was my thought too but I wanted other opinions. ,runner5k,cuj6ozr,2,t5_2x6x0
5022594,0,t3_3jhay5,Congrats!!!! I do the shoulders in my ears nonsense too and constantly have to remind myself not to. lol But its amazing the difference good form can make on a run!,runner5k,curewwb,1,t5_2x6x0
5820694,0,t3_3uw8g1,My best advice is this If you run run slowly. Even if you know you can run faster maintain a slow run. Its better to develop the stamina to run for ten minutes straight than to tire yourself out after two minutes of sprinting. Running is a long commitment  you will have plenty of time to trim minutes off your K pace and youll have achievable goals to look forward to in the first few months after your CK training is complete.,runner5k,cxim96k,3,t5_2x6x0

6072867,0,t1_cyfgkwq,Dont forget to stretch and hydrate.  My wife bought me a belt that holds two small  oz. water bottles and my music player.  Whenever you slow to a walk its a good opportunity to take a sip or two.Edit I accidentally a word.,runner5k,cyfn1rp,1,t5_2x6x0
6252818,0,t3_4140i7,My experience was really awesome. Met up with another runner in Philly and we started our races at the Art Museum steps. It was fun opening the envelope afterwards and seeing our medals. No gold for us unfortunately.Im glad they are doing it again. ,runner5k,cz0dlze,2,t5_2x6x0

8053474,0,t3_4ph48d,I have to admit though I like that this bug fits with the plot.  Ive had a couple problems in later weeks where the sound goes in the middle of exposition those suck...,runner5k,d4labg7,5,t5_2x6x0
8399804,0,t1_d5o2egg,The full app will be a better experience for you as its still being actively supported by the developer. Im having similar issues with the Android version of ZRK and it hasnt been updated in  years Your best bet as others have suggested is to run another tracking app in the background. It wont solve your issues but at least it will track your complete run.,runner5k,d5risul,2,t5_2x6x0
9029948,0,t1_d7prj6a,Thats a great soundtrack. I should definitely look into that.,runner5k,d7x99qb,1,t5_2x6x0
9706271,0,t1_da9gn6r,Yes exactly.  I think its just based on your fitness level.  If you can run then run it.  But if youre unable to run for the whole free form run remember this is a beginner program then I would walk as quickly as possible.  Some people on here do intervals i.e. walk for one min runjog for one minrepeat.,runner5k,da9i85v,2,t5_2x6x0
10527146,0,t1_dd13xx5,Sometimes I really just want to GO! Youll see why in week .  In those cases I do my best to run at last half the time and be able to run the entire time before moving forward to the next week repeating days as needed. I repeat a lot of days.,runner5k,dd1d7gt,3,t5_2x6x0
11001881,0,t1_def0q25,gt Cant believe that its almost over!Me neither!  Im actually a bit anxious that in a week time Im expected to run K nonstop whats that  minutes or so?. Not sure how I feel about that ...,runner5k,def14l0,2,t5_2x6x0
11002098,0,t1_def14l0,We can do it!! Yah Im nervous for the full run but im hoping the good doctor and Sam will distract me enough! I think WD will be a good test with the  minute free form I found that if I obsess too much about the time or distance it becomes infinitely harder! ,runner5k,def20i3,2,t5_2x6x0
