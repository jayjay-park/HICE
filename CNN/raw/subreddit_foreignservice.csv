5051009,0,t3_3jitdx,I know several FSOs who have done internships andor worked at foreign consulates in the United States prior to becoming FSOs.  In most cases its not a problem at all.  The only case where I heard of issues was a person who worked for a Mexican consulate providing services to Mexican citizens many of whom were in the United States without legal permission.  In that case the person was also married to a person who was in the United States without legal permission so there was a bit more to it than just the employment.  That case resulted in a Final Suitability denial for the candidate because they determined that the candidate might not be able to adequately apply U.S. immigration law the candidate was consular tracked given the circumstances.,foreignservice,cuuu6i0,1,t5_2ud2t
5079562,0,t1_cuy189z,Ok got it.  So Id say broadly that it might depend a bit on whether you think youd rather go for the U.S. or Canadian foreign service.  I would think that if the Canadian one appealed to you more sticking with DFATD would make more sense and if you were more interested in U.S. foreign service then one of the U.S. DOS internships would probably make more sense.  I dont know anything about the DFATD hiring process and what might or might not be helpful for that but I have to think that experience within DFATD is more likely to be helpful in their hiring processes help you make connections etc. On the internship in Malawi some of the advantages are that youll get to experience working overseas in an embassy and see if thats a good fit for you.  The foreign service isnt a good fit for everyone and trying it out can be useful.  To your parents point there will be an ambassador and diplomats there too.  Since its a relatively small post you may get to work with them more directly than you would at FSI which is a much larger place.  To FSI your duties and what you might get out of it would probably depend on which office.  Your parents are correct that there are a lot of diplomats and some ambassadors at FSI but you may or may not really work with any of them.  There are also a lot of civil service and contractors working at FSI and you may spend the vast majority of your time working with them with quite limited interaction with FSOs.  That said those contracting companies often make new hires from interns with active security clearances.  So that one might be more likely to lead to a job offer but not necessarily to becoming a diplomat.  ,foreignservice,cuya2jk,1,t5_2ud2t

8402975,0,t1_d5qwcv5,I think you may be putting the cart before the horse here. How much time do you have left before youre finished with grad school? If you pass the PNs youll take the OA between November and February. If you pass that it will take about  months and possibly longer to complete your security clearance investigation. When thats all finished assuming you pass all of that most people do then youre added to the register in order of your OA score. If your score is really high you could get called for the next A that will start after you are added to the register. If not you could get called any time within the  months before you drop off of the register... And during all this time you keep living your life. You continue going to school you work you do whatever you would do if you were not pursuing the FS.What Im getting at is that the earliest you might end up in A would be in mid and sometime in  may be more likely. So you may well have time to finish that degree before you enter the FS should you make it to that point. Side note your starting pay will be higher with the degree than without so if you CAN finish before you start A youll want to do that to get the higher pay.As far as a minimum commitment time I cant speak to that but I believe if you decide to leave within a certain period of time you will be responsible for repaying the cost of your training and if youve already been posted overseas the cost of moving you and your stuff to the overseas post. How long that period of time is though I am not sure. And there might be other ways to get your degree done if you get into the FS before you finish as well.,foreignservice,d5rx24e,3,t5_2ud2t

If your spouse is coming to the country on a diplomatic visa which they would in most cases its more likely theyll not be able to work on the local economy.  Some spouses give up their diplomatic visa and instead get a standard work visa to get around this but you lose protections associated with diplomatic status when you do that which is almost never worth it.Most importantly. you will not have to silently stomach harassment.  There is not a post anywhere in the world that would pressure you to not make a big deal about harassment.  The United States is an open and ardent supporter of gay rights overseas and that support starts with our staff.  If you or your spouse is subject to harassment of any sort but especially harassment related to sexual orientation let your RSO and Front Office know about it.  Im confident theyll respond appropriately but if they dont there are yet more resources for you further up the chain.The former Consul General in Muslimmajority Istanbul was an openly gay man and while serving in that position he met and married a Turkish man.
