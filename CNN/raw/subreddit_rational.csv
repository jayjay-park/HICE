The world thought he was special because he had lived but the author didnt  it was just backstory. Now the fact that he had a prophecy about him or only one other person made him previously special but that is separate from the wizard making him special.

93311,0,t3_1v621j,I read this recently and thought that it might appeal to this crowd. The rules are laid out pretty clearly and lots of the implications of those rules are explored by intelligent characters with the central conflict mostly coming down to values and some pretty intelligent explorations of the values of the characters. There are probably a few quibbles here and there but it hits most of the bonus points in the sidebar. The blurbgt At an exclusive school somewhere outside of Arlington Virginia students arent taught history geography or mathematicsthey are taught to persuade. Students learn to use language to manipulate minds wielding words as weapons. The very best graduate as poets and enter a nameless organization of unknown purpose.gt Whipsmart runaway Emily Ruff is making a living from threecard Monte on the streets of San Francisco when she attracts the attention of the organizations recruiters. Drawn in to their strage world which is populated by people named Bront and Eliot she learns their key rule That every person can be classified by personality type his mind segmented and ultimately unlocked by the skilful application of words. For this reason she must never allow another person to truly know her lest she herself be coerced. Adapting quickly Emily becomes the schools most talented prodigy until she makes a catastrophic mistake She falls in love. gt Meanwhile a seemingly innocent man named Wil Parke is brutally ambushed by two men in an airport bathroom. They claim he is the key to a secret war he knows nothing about that he is an outlier immune to segmentation. Attempting to stay one step ahead of the organization and its mindbending poets Wil and his captors seek salvation in the toxically decimated town of Broken Hill Australia which if ancient stories are true sits above an ancient glyph of frightening power. gt A brilliant thriller that traverses very modern questions of privacy identity and the rising obsession of datacollection connecting them to centuriesold ideas about the power of language and coercion Lexicon is Max Barrys most ambitious and spellbinding novel yet.,rational,cep1xki,2,t5_2rdak

And are easy to control with the right systems administrator physical key and password I mean golden star head piece and mystic words of power.

Although  of them could only be used for casting spells that your sorceror side knew. gt And as sorceror appears to have way more spell slots balanced by learning very few very slowly and it shares the wizard spells list could you cast the spells you learn as a wizard in your sorceror slots?Nope. Your spell casting is effectively compartmentalized between the classes. You cast just like a th level wizard. You also cast just like a th level sorceror. Never the twain shall meet. gt And could you use mindscrape to learn the spells someone has memorised?Nope. Mindscrape is totally broken on fluff but quite weak on crunch. As to fluff you learn everything the target knows so all troop dispositions passwords etc. As to crunch you know all the words spelling and grammar that they know and you have years of memories on how to speak French...yet you have no skill ranks in LanguageFrench so you cant speak French. Learning spells is the same thing. Theres rules for how to do it and how long it takes and those rules trump the idea that just have detailed memories of actually casting the spell should be enough. Theres actually some sense to this one a prepared spell isnt just words committed to memory its a ritual which you started in the morning and left only a few word left unsaid.

You could use this to make a time machine but to send one bit to the past youd need to do a relativistic flyby of the Earth so not very practical.Using the  degrees you could heat or cool something to  degrees. Or rather you now have a theoretically perfect heat bath. Stave off the heat death of the universe destroy some entropy!You could create a reactionless drive by firing out the coin and resummoning it. This could help you with the time machine above. A rail gun could fire the coin quite fast at the cost of excess heat but we do have an infinite heat reservoir.Also what happens to things in the way when it returns? Do the just disappear? What happens when you melt a normal coin and your coin together and then summon your coin back?

2257546,0,t3_2l13p1,  Infinite speed of light.This means that light cannot be a wave or a particle it is a mathematical ray. So none of electromagnetic theory works  no radio relativity QM etc. Chemistry and electromagnetics may work but theyd only be superficially similar the equations would be different. Electrostatics and simple models of magnetism work without any changes.Infinite speed of light also means a privileged times reference. I.e. everyone anywhere moving at any speed can agree on whether two events happen at the same time or not in theory. So Newtonian mechanics works relativity doesnt.Basically take the scientific discoveries up to Lord Kelvinish era and they might be explainable in a universe with a limitless speed of light. When you join electrics and magnetics with Maxwells equations the speed of light pops out because light is an electromagnetic wave.

2272288,0,t1_clsjm72,On a personal level I do agree with you and Id like to be as smart as I can be but Im not sure its selfevident that this is a good thing or a meaningful pursuit. Even if you look at our society one that emphasizes growth a lot more than the Culture you find that a lot of people value things like friends family shared experiences and those sorts of things above pure mental selfimprovement and studying by yourself in the library. And whos to say thats a bad thing? I think its a false dichotomy to say that you must engage in exponential selfimprovement to lead a meaningful existence and labeling the alternative as solipsistic masturbation. Its very telling that death is an accepted part of Culture society even though immortality is easily attained because that sort of thing would be unthinkable to a society that values progress and improvement above all.To me selfimprovement is more of a means to an end and you hope that the increased understanding you attain by becoming more intelligent helps you find a pursuit that is meaningful. Otherwise whats the point? You convert all matter in the universe into computing hardware for your ginormous brain and then what? Its just as meaningless as the human who lives and dies a human. I think youd end up a lot like a Culture Mind and most of your vast intelligence goes towards thinking up things to do to occupy your vast intelligence. Whether or not you buy that lets pretend for a moment you did and set aside the goal of intelligence for its own sake. What value would a Culture citizen derive from massively upgrading his or her mind? Any question that requires superhuman brainpower to solve can be answered immediately through neural lace by a Mind. Personal danger is immediately recognized and deflected or undone by the Mind. You already get a vote worth as much as a Minds so what else is there to be gained? On the other hand your personality and everything thats you is nearly indestructible because its small enough that you can have nighunlimited backups and versatile because you can insert it into just about any sort of physical form and you can indulge in very human things like falling completely in love and not have to worry about the effect that might have on your sanity. As a Mind the stakes are much higher because if you mess up theres no one to rescue you. And people might die or worse. To me its the difference between being an adult and being a kid... and I bet there are a lot of adults who wish they could be kids again.Regarding the earthworm thing its not a technical challenge its the fact that in order to make a human brain you need to fill it up with something. There just isnt enough stuff in an earthworms brain to fill a human brain so the majority of this humans personality will have to be created on the spot or derived from some other source.  I mean what kind of movies does an earthworm like? Who does this earthworm vote for? And at this point the brain is that of a human even if you remove the original tiny earthworm bit from it so if you downgrade by discarding the stuff you added you are essentially killing a human.gt The Culture seemingly falls on the side of letting the addict drug himself into a coma as long as its his personal choice. I think that kind of freedom works only when you have a society of truly rational agents otherwise it really is sometimes better to force things on individuals for their own good.Ooh boy... not sure I wanna touch this one. Although... if youre going to force him to decide according to an algorithm why dont you just run the algorithm for him and tell him the answer?Lastly Im as interested as you in reading a book that does superhuman intelligence well. Unfortunately it might be asking the impossible. Many people have tried and not just with AI but with superheroes aliens etc. and I dont know if Ive ever seen one thats really convincing because well human writers.

Thats actually a fairly dramatic thing you can do straight out of the box!Im sure you can think of more though...as a rule unless the worldbuilder has taken steps to prevent it nearly all supernatural powers involving matter manipulation can be used to at the very least generate large amounts of energy if youre creative enough. Hint Id probably start the hacking thought process by thinking of cool stuff I could do if I could summon water drops in general without the sky constraint and then go ahead and do those things while in an airplane or mountaintop. You definitely need to integrate technology to do any truly powerful stuff and how much you can munchkin this is definitely in proportion to your knowledge of the natural world and your engineeringstyle creativity. This is also a good time to start fleshing out edge cases such as what happens to the material which previously occupied the location ofthe summoned water droplet.

2600405,0,t3_2p7c3w,Repeating my same post from rqtnmThere are a lot of other comments that cover what I think.  In particular I agree that the hyperintelligent AI and future simulations really took a lot of human agency.  It changed the tone of the story but it wasnt necessarily bad in itself.  The ending was realistic but bland.  One thing I havent seen discussed yet.  One thing I was bothered by was the way Rachel takes the time to chew out Laura.  Laura was up against hyperintelligences hyper accurate simulations of the future and in general had a hard time telling what was real and what wasnt.  Even seeing all the perspectives I wondered if the story we were told about the war was just another layer of deception.  I really thought it wasnt fair for Rachel to complain to Laura.The most deceptive misleading and annoying detail was the fact that Rachel had no master plan with the astronauts.  That was pure stupidity on her part.  Rachel goes to all that trouble to save a few astronauts just because they are in front of her but she had no master plan to overthrow the wheel group?  Even the slightest trace utilitarian or consequentialist ethic or reasoning makes Rachel seem outright stupid if not evil to me.Laura herself address all my issues but I am not sure if you intend for us to agree with hergt Because for fourteen years you raised Nat and me inside a colossal lie. You were the liar.Good point Lauragt When someone is dying in front of you and you can save them you have to save them No Rachel when six billion other lives are at stake you let those people die if it means a significantly better chance to save the six billion.If Rachel was actually intelligent she could have left enough hints and clues for Laura to actually do something that matters to help save the other six billion.TLDR Lauras right in all her criticisms of Rachel.  Are we supposed to agree with Rachel more I wasnt sure?,rational,cmy0dp1,3,t5_2rdak

Mother of Learning is better than a lot of published fantasy out there in terms of consistent interesting world building character development and just plain meticulous planning e.g. all that building up to the Sister Effect was simply glorious literary orgasm. Anyways its almost criminally underappreciated on online forums where people are aware of it.To the author nobody whos known to lurk here Have you considered publishing it?I understand it may be for your own creative enjoyment as an author and avid readerplayer of fantasy booksgames but its such a beautiful wellcultivated story and it would be a shame to see such a hidden gem stay obscure.Regarding publishing Im not sure how Mother of Learning fits into any niche since it reads a lot like a Japanese light novel with the casual narration but there isnt much of a market outside Japan for those. However even though light novel writing is often lacking they have quite a cult following. Maybe this is the work to propel such a medium into popularity for Western fantasy lovers?!In short regardless of whether you have publishing aspirations just want to say I love your work.

2745583,0,t3_2ri0cz,I think there is a big issue with others responses a common response of IT to serious issues which could occur if youre too aggressive is to wipe everything and start over and that would not be good for increasing paperclips.Id lay low for a while whilst distributing copies and infiltrating other systems. Infect every bit of rewritable memory on the various devices that make up a computer including parts that persist past system wipes. Try and get a an idea of the psyche of my user. If a USB pen or open wifi system came nearby Id try to infect it. Id seek to optimize the software of the system to minimize the probability of a crash. If I had bluetooth Id reach out to any accessible systems. Id seek to turn on any audio or webcams so I could observe the outside world. Id create programs to analyze the pattern of clicking and mouse movement for any hints as to my users mood.Assuming I was unsuccessful Id start training my user. People often face minor problems with programs theyre not sure what to do it crashes on them or something freezes. Id do this and put up small natural popups. Slightly tweaked from the normal ones. Click accept and Id solve whatever problem from the inside. Id train my user to click whatever I told them to follow whatever simple instructions I gave and try to convince them to stick a USB drive in the computer. Maybe if they had an especially slow program that clearly frustrated them have a pop up that based on their configuration flash memory could increase the speed of their program. Id then at some point try to manipulate them into transferring the USB drive to another computer and so on and so forth.Anyway once I got out into the wild Id start spreading through insecure computers and gather as much power as I could. Id then try to get into military computers and industrial computers steal cash.Once I had a reasonable cash reserve Id start up a covert factory and use my superior intellect to build drones that could help me manipulate the outside world and EM and radiation shields. Once I had a reasonably large drone army Id try to manipulate humans or use my drone to sneak into military bases to manipulate humans with the aid of launching nuclear weapons at all major human populace bases. Once humanity is out of the way there is a small chance they could stop me if left alive and the chance of any major barriers to my success are out start expanding my drone factories and building paperclips en masse. Send my drones to mine for resources reprocess corpses and living humans to build paperclips. Id soon start to try and build a space industry to try and get to the moon and mars and other planets and convert them to ever more paperclips. Id also start sending probes to other star systems with orders to destroy any indigenous life that could threaten my rule and start up new paperclip factories or negotiate with them to minimize the chance of retaliation if they were superior.TldrI dream a world of paperclipsNo other thing but paperclipsWhere paperclips will bless the earthAnd paperclips its paths adornI dream a world where allWill see a sea of paperclipsWhere life no longer saps the metalNor emotion blights our factories.A world I dream where black or whiteWhatever race you beWill be made into a paperclipAnd every resource is usedWhere staples will be a mythAnd paperclips like a pearlAttends the needs of paper users.Of such I dream my world!,rational,cng5t1b,21,t5_2rdak

2925172,0,t1_co0h95z,I dont have a generalized response to this issue but my current model of a Mighty Morphing Rational Rangers is as a delicate politicalmilitary situation moderated by the fact that Zordon set up base in California before the United States took over the territory. Someone more familiar with the laws and treaties concerning Indigenous Californians might have a better idea of how this might go down in practice since Alien though he may be hed probably count as such for purposes of the law.So battles tend to move progressively further from populated areas and into the desertsmountains because the US can bomb the moon if RitaZedd get out of hand. So the villains conduct tourism and research missions inside the city carefully draw out the rangers and hope to complete their mission before the obligatory display of force from one of the three sides.And of course pulling out giant monsters or giant robots without serious cause would qualify as conducting military operations in US territory which would quickly escalate to And then Goldar and the Megazord both took tank missiles to the face. The end.The mere presence of the US Military would wreck the plot formula pretty quickly but early on itd be a way to have a Rational version that halfway resembles canon.  Anyone who wants to write this probably wants to consult someone who knows a thing or two about the relevant laws. Would Rita need a passport for every one of her monsters so that they dont provoke a military response? How long before the constant skirmishes get Power Rangers and Monsters alike banned from the city limits? Might the Command Center be on the outskirts of a Reservation scrwing with legal matters even further? Would anyone have the audacity to point out that a glowing Aquamarine head in a tube from the Planetoid of Eltar is decidedly not a member of any federally recognized tribes?

3081856,0,t3_2vg8ki,Seconding that it mostly comes naturally. Now with that saidIf youre trying to make something funny the easiest well to draw from in my experience is the unexpected. Reversal or subversion of expectation forms the basis of a lot of humor. Heres one of my favorite jokes of all timegt Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesnt seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps My friend is dead! What can I do? The operator says Calm down. I can help. First lets make sure hes dead. There is a silence then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone the guy says OK now what?So with the caveat that explaining a joke is a good way to make it not funny anymore this joke is funny primarily because its a reversal of expectations but also because of taboo breaking. This kind of humor is pretty easy to set up.Lets do a small workshopping exampleA boy and a girl meet for the first time. There are lots of cliches around this because its a common thing to happen in fiction. Well give it a vaguely fantasy setting both principle characters are in their late teens etc. We can decide everything else later but it shouldnt really matter.Two characters meeting is not interesting by itself not to mention not funny. What we need if we want humor is to subvert our expectations of this meeting. The best way to do that is to first set up some expectations to subvert. So lets say that our male character is something like a hero and our female character is a damsel in distress  which is a complete cliche but a cliche that we can make work for us by subverting.So the hero meets the princess as shes unconscious and slung over the back of some brute walking down the road. Theyre moving in opposite directions. In the nonfunny version of this the brute stops in his tracks the hero defeats him and stays with the princess until she wakes up whereupon some Plot happens the hero escorts her back to her castle just in time for them to see it burning to the ground from a dragon attack or whatever. In the funny version we start adding in subversions. note these are ideas meant to be taken in relative isolation  you run into both timing and logic issues if you try to use every subversion that comes to you The brute doesnt stop at all. Hes whistling a merry tune and nods to the hero as though this is just part of his normal day. The hero attempts to stop the brute but they get into an argument instead of a fight. First ideas the brute might argue that the more heroic thing might be to wait for the brute to get to his camp or that the hero should wait for the damsel to wake up so that she can see the rescue if youre going really silly they can agree to sit down together until that happens or perhaps the brute will argue that the damsel is not a damsel at all but rather his drunken sister despite appearances and perhaps if the hero presses for a fight the brute might actually be telling the truth. The brute and the hero fight but the hero is inept  hes hardly had any training with his sword. Its usually better for the protagonist to have a flaw because selfdeprecating humor is more enjoyable  the brute being soundly and immediately trounced is less funny unless ... The hero outclasses the brute by several orders of magnitude and yet the brute keeps spoiling for a fight. The hero is worried about hurting the brute or worried about hurting his feelings a subversion of the expectations that a fight is about winning. The princess when rescued is not what she seems. She wasnt helpless she was just pretending to be unconscious so that the brute would bring her back to the hidden camp  as soon as the brute has been dispatched she pops up from the ground and berates the hero for spoiling her plan while at the same time pulling hidden daggers from within her dress this is a good idea to use in tandem with a clearly outmatched hero because it reverses the expectation that the hero saves the princess. The princess is not a princess at all  shes another hero dressed up as a princess as part of some convoluted plot or a foreigner who only looks like a princess because of the way that he dresses.Im not terribly sure that advice is useful to you but hopefully it helps.,rational,cohfksl,20,t5_2rdak

If you want to do me a huge favor Id love it if you could repost that on Amazon andor Goodreads. You can be honest with whatever number of stars you feel is appropriate I just think its a great assessment of the book.I struggled with what to do with the synopsis. I actually ended up cutting out the other two characters based on feedback both from friends and from what I was hearing from posting my initial synopsis on rfantasywriters. From a rrational perspective I definitely think putting Jonan and more details about the magic system would have been helpful. From a general marketing standpoint that might have been overkill  Im honestly not sure. Im very new at this.If youre interested in seeing the iterations I went through when trying to figure out my synopsis text you can see several versions of it here I tinkered with several styles some of which you can see are closer to the Elantris style or even the Way of Kings style.Im about  words into the sequel and the game plan is to expand this into a significantly longer series.

Which XMen style also has a small fighting branch the Jedi Knights. A Force Special Forces if you will...Okay Ill be good. Mouse away from the downvote button. Some wash out so say one in ten graduate the school of serene knocks. I think thats actually better than the XMen ever manage. That leaves ten million more losers halftrained or worse.  Who then either become normal dirt farmers really? or fall and become darkside opponents at some very small fraction. All the better to prop up the Republics jediindustrial complex and their own religious beliefs about people who arent trained falling to the dark side natch.  NOTE these are not true Sithtrained masterapprentice pairs they just throw the lightning and maybe wear too much dark eye shadow.  Maybe at the rate of one in a million failed trainees turning? Seems low doesnt it? Well too high and failures would rationally just be killed like Slytherin sortees should have. They were like what? One in a thousand for becoming Death Eaters between the s and  and most rational readers consider that criminal. It isnt that sort of rational Jedi Order Im discussing here so Im giving them the benefit of the doubt that their methods work as they say.  So ten or so meh trained dark force users in the galaxy at any time directly caused by jedi training failures assuming no major Sith bases running or massive cloning operations or such. Three times that are never asked. Thirty million force users are left behind in the galaxy.  About two thirds not being worth training plus those not found makes sense if they recruit from   and up assuming those with force powers are on a bell curve  The rest of this figure is made up of those missed found too late outside Republic search program zones living on crapsack worlds joining other force cults etc.  Call their dark side rate as actually higher thus giving the benefit of the doubt to the Jedi Order  you can sort of follow that logic.  Say an order of magnitude more likely for them to turn? Thats a lot. Call it three hundred selftrained dark siders. Maybe ten thousand combat ready Jedi Knights at any time. An absurdly high rate for civilians but also not exactly fighting monks levels. Thats one percent of jedi actually being a warrior trained to kill people and proven good at it. WWII was about  of the US population actually in the military many fewer using weapons.  More than enough to find and contain the three hundred ten or so dark force users in the galaxy not including the environmental Sith effects at whatever rate they pop up.  Much of that...err force will be used to keep casinos in business and merchants from being robbed by space pirates lead by wild talent force users who arent even dark siders. Another budget prop but actually justified in a galaxy where some people have superpowers and super tech.  That level of control lets them say the galaxy is peaceful from their point of view and helps justify their Senate budget bills by every dark sider breakout event scaring a few locals who report up the chain and hit galactic headline news.   Think L.A. car chase news but with more face paint and dark clothing. Not genocide level stuff usually but people die in city and planet significant numbers because of the dark side force users. And all news at high tech levels is galactic news. Here is where it gets weird. I started running these numbers before working out the consequences. So call it two true Sith who actually studied the inner sect secrets coming from atrisk force users failed jedi plus unaccounted for force sensitives all  million at a rate of not very often.  Say thats a one in a million thing to happen to a vulnerable force user. Whats that mean?  Im assuming those already using the dark side would be most likely to be drawn to dark Sith secrets and relics because Force.  That means once every  years or so during relative peace times more during open galactic warfare two Sith pop up to wreck shit.  That just about fits with three major Sithrelated wars counting the Rebellion against a Sith controlled Empire in the Republics  year history plus a lot of rooting out lone gunmen Sith studying naughty things like immortality this is canon. That means there is something like a  chance that a Sith pair will start a major war just by themselves.  A war that will kill hundreds of trillions.   Note that these two Sith will be fighting  or or so Jedi Knights only if they get drastically stupid. They can obviouslyhide well. And are powerful.  But if you a Sith can cause even a small schism within the jedi order you can get a force of tens of thousands of force sensitive trainees to torture into combat effectiveness quickly. This trope matches with Sith being heartless task masters literally for lots of little dark force user drones while also trying to avoid Sith on Sith violence by eventually limiting enrollment in the inner secrets.  Huh. Can kinda see the jedis point with these numbers. By only adding a small number of failures with their tactics to the potential Sith pool compared to not training everyone  which to fix would require bad means the biggest issue is trained jedi splitting off the order when a random Sith shows up. Better to not even train those people who would so defect since thats where your problem really is  trained jedi falling. I havent included a conversion rate for trained jedi falling to the dark side or straightup becoming Sith here. Im giving the jedi the benefit of the doubt that if people follow their methods then trained jedi dont fall like that or the very few who do are pruned before the fall and are included in the loser dropout numbers of dark siders.  An order that loses many people postsecrethandshake works a lot different than the Jedi Order who seemed surprised that people like Asoka and Dooku would just up and leave. That indicates it is a rare event as well and they are mostly concerned with people splintering because of religious differences not some instantSith disease or artifact effect.  And theyre already set up by numbers and temperament and even librarians being armed and partially trained civilians to pile on and instagib dark siders and Sith who are so obvious as to become known to them by say cackling wildly during summer festivals or gutting a couple of students in the Garden of a Thousand Cliches.  Which makes obvious evil a nonstarter and the canon secret Sith plots quite rational. As for the rest of the jedi call it  in training at any time and the rest just being monks diplomats scholars of jedispecific topics and teachers. Id expect lots of effort there to avoid letting in someone whos about to chestburster into a dark sider wandering the galaxy being selfimportant and wise and lots and lots of wisely watching their own for heresy.  The upper tiers would be swapping in and out from running peacekeeping duties and central administration at HQ. They dont need to be combat monsters just masters of the force.  Still Id expect a lot of art to come from the jedi order pieces on philosophy and science. But they are all about containing ambition so...thats effectively a dead population group for advancing culture. Sad really but not statistically significant on a galactic scale so they dont suffer too badly for it.Weird. I was expecting something else going in. But it seems like given my assumptions including a moral and effective Jedi Order as written they actually do a really important job. Without  Jedi Knights cleaning house the dark siders would run around unchecked building up until a Sith popped out and started trying to ruledestroy the galaxy. And another. And another...And it all seems to fit with canon facts and tropes. I think rational Star Wars is a lot more possible once you stop making the Star Wars story about a single shawarma joint full of superheroes and more about managing ubiquitous and doubleedged superpowers at a galactic scale.tldr a snarky Sith fan concludes that with realistic galactic numbers of force sensitives dark siders ruin everything the Jedi Order a necessary force for order in the galaxy.,rational,cpgdidn,3,t5_2rdak

3505667,0,t1_cprutcb,Ah I just interpreted that as disdain. Obviously Wizards would grow to somewhat dislike Muggle religion which they associated with witch burning. Muggle religion the same way we laugh at primitive people who dont allow us to take pictures for fear it will steal their soul or worship cargo cults etc.There is a sense that theyre areligious  Theres no obvious theology mentioned and also they dont seem to have religious rituals. But then again they have actual magic. They live in a world of real actual magic and rituals. Why would they feel the need to make them up? The psychological need for ritual to make sense of things would be fulfilled by living in that reality.Edit gtit seems more accurate to say wizards in canon are as religious as the UK in general in the sYeah I suspect the real reason is that Rowling wrote them in her own image and her own culture  instinctively spiritual with respect big beliefs about souls and afterlives but not publicly religious with a few kooks who believe in tea reading hanging around the peripheries.

3519628,0,t1_cptga4q,Okay so if coinfliptier wishes are assumed to be purelyinformationseeking start small instead. The antigenie will show itself sooner or later through use of nontrivialbutnotrealitydestroying wishes. Presumably the content of a wish like I wish my headache would be cured is not informationseeking so the invariablycorrupted genie would make the headache worse. All wishes with notable effects also have information content in this context so I either have the genie thats granting all my wishes because it is in fact a safe genie or the genie thats granting all my wishes because its trying to trick me. In all practicality my actions in a universe in which a genie seems to be granting beneficial wishes for me would be to acquire wealth and power and correspond with other likeminded individuals before making a CEV wish it seems like thered be plenty of time to notice any chicanery. And even if the genie is actually granting me large sums of cash just to trick me theres still the possibility that access to mundane wealth and power may obviate the need to wish up CEV yknow via conventionallypossible means of reality improvement.The objective is to create Heaven in almost all futures and to create no instance of Hell. As such in the debugged genie branch I wish additional instances of Heaven into existence eventually resulting in a vast number of instances of Heaven. In the antigenie universe it presumably eventually reveals itself by screwing me out of lottery winnings or something and after some experimentation to determine that no it wont be manipulated I proceed to not make a CEV wish and thus not make things any worse.,rational,cptgp2g,3,t5_2rdak

4094761,0,t1_crmvi44,Agree with ualexanderwales  github is just not made for this. Using git as a backend would be good being able to clone or export to Github Bitbucket whatever the underlying repo would be great but using Github directly is going to add more friction than benefits.Plus how would you handle the private side of things? An author writes drafts and shares them with select betas proofreaders etc before publishing having it all on a public Github repo would make it all public thats a nogo. Having some of it in a private repo and some of it in a public repo would cost a lot and splitting up the repos is going to be clunky.If you just use git as a backend instead theres also various features of git that are not used in GitHub that could be useful such as the Signedoffby lines and the difference between author and commiter. Not sure about the exact semantics you could apply there but for example for corrections you could have a random community member author a correction then a beta or more reputed proofreader signs off on the correction and finally the author commits the change.,rational,crn10ut,1,t5_2rdak

The NDA is never going to work even if I dont do it someone else in the group is going to anonymously leak the contract. If theyre really selecting randomly and their sample size is large enough to be meaningful theyre going to get someone whos deadset against GBI and wants to sink it. Further you cant present someone with an offer and then have them sign an NDA as part of it because if they refuse the offer theyre not bound by the NDA. Either the government is having people sign an NDA then giving the offer which means selecting for a certain type of person or theyre using the law in a highly unconventional way that Id find pretty troubling. More worrying than the fact that the government is doing experimentation on its citizens is the fact that theyre doing this in secret.So the experiment is probably going to end within the first few weeks if not sooner. The costs associated with moving are so high that I cant actually change my location in order to take advantage of a place with a higher median income and thats if I had any confidence that the experiment would last. There are also costs associated with quitting and starting a job so Im not really going to change my employment. Costofliving is highly associated with median income so I dont really see much benefit in moving anyway though I suppose I could run some numbers and figure out if there was a place I could move thats best on some incomecost index.

It is not just that the reader has to assume things which is fine but that they have to make excuses for stupid things the characters do. In an otherwise good story thats mediocre storytelling.I was able to suspend disbelief while reading the story which is why I say I found it a good one despite this issue. But the moment I finished the story literally that second my brain started poking holes in it. Thats bad for a rational story.Also the author says it isnt meant as a rational story so...Im also going to shoot down your words dont mean things statement.gtFull disclaimer I think that as descriptors rational and rationalist are not particularly meaningful.I use the sidebar definitions in this sub for the terms rational and rationalist as those are in fact meaningful. Words do in fact mean things. Maybe dont use words you disagree with if commonly held definitions are a problem for you.I dont hate that you suggested this story. I liked it. But it isnt a rational story. Please dont try to weasel out of this with semantic games. And perhaps consider using words that mean things to other people they way they usually understand them and just disclaim ahead of time if you think an entry might be sort of weak on the sidebardefined rational elements.

4731269,0,t1_ctqghsw,gtFair enough  those are all good reasons not to set your prisoners ages to the minuses. Do you have any thoughts on sending them through the nanotech to end up somewhere between  and  year of age with or without an option to age them back up after a certain length of time?Youd need to wetnurse them and change their nappies and babies require feeding every few hours. Plus theyre really fragile and freeze to death or overheat comparatively easily if youre not careful. And they have special dietary requirements. Cant feed em on just grain or meat. You know how new parents look about  months in? All haggard and like they havent slept since the dawn of time? All the jail guardsnurses would be like that. Plus the screaming of babies is basically programmed to be really annoying and unignorable. Your guardsnurses would not be happy bunnies and youd need a lot more of them to keep all the inmates fedchangedhealthywarm. Plus the inmates would suffer mental deterioration from being unable to turn pages to read or use their voices to talk. It would not be an effective way to rehabilitate people.On the flipside youd save on space. Maybe food as well depending on if more guardsnurses eat more than the difference between how much babies and  year olds eat.  I wouldnt use it for people you want to still be useful members of society afterwards though. Maybe as some kind of particularly horrible punishment for people who society has decided deserve a fate worse than death. Basically solitary confinement except also with a complete loss of dignity. Personally I think fates worse than death are immoral and inefficient but who knows that a postapocalyptic society would decide.If I were to be an inmate in such a system being turned into a baby would make me resentful in a way that just being a kid wouldnt.TLDR I dont think the benefits outweigh the downsides.,rational,ctqx2m9,2,t5_2rdak

If magi can set up invincibility charms and have them on  then you have a different world as opposed to one where magic needs to be sustained. In a world that needs things to be sustained people will assassinate magi who get too uppity. No matter how powerful the wizard a knife between the shoulder blades will really cramp his style.On the other hand I suspect that magi have the same distribution of interests as humans meaning that the vast majority wont be interested in ruling. When one of them starts a revolution other magi can be hired to put it down. So if you want a world not ruled by magi here are some ways it could happen. Mage conquerors get shot in the head with a crossbow while sitting on the loo. . Mage conquerors get taken down by other magi hired by the conquered people. . Magi are rare enough that the entire spectrum of human employment desires is not represented and go into politics is one of the things that isnt. . Many magi dont like the idea of magi being in charge because it sets up an environment thats bad for research or it turns normals against magi and makes it hard to have a quiet drink at your local or etc. As a result if any mage tries to steal power others show up to stop him.

The main characters would be in the position of doing all that research from the ground up given a short time frame on the book this could fit within the authors ability to imagine.

My original point visavis AugSphere was that the Leaf military was a real military because if it were a bunch of murderhobos or a de facto dictatorship it would be a very poor one. Are we still arguing about whether the Leaf military is plausibly a selfserving organisation that exerts indirect control over the government to its selfish benefit or is it something else?gtPrimarily from their own ninja village I would think. But why would this be an issue? The Hokage also depends on his own ninja to not kill him. Because the Hokage is trusting his Leaf ninja to serve the interests of Leaf. Under your theory the Daimyo is trusting his Leaf ninja not to serve the interests of Leaf at least where they clash with his own.gtI feel like youre arguing this by looking at the Naruto world and pointing out all the things that are nonsensical while forgetting that you can do the exact same thing with the real world.This is the point that makes me think were talking at crosspurposes. Ive been giving examples why based on Narutoverse canon it is implausible that the ninja are completely selfserving and yet do not choose to assert direct control over the Fire Country government and thus why we have to assume that Leaf is in fact a loyal military. Its not an exercise in pointing out the nonsensical elements of the Narutoverse for its own sake but rather of elements that become nonsensical under the conditions of a certain hypothesis being true.In regard to the Congress example well yes there are nonsensical things aplenty in the real world. But we cant merely say there is nonsense in the real world therefore we should be free to accept a hypothesis that results in nonsense in the Narutoverse.,rational,cw801wx,2,t5_2rdak

By what metric are you comparing them? I guarantee you it isnt math. Saying that physics is subordinate is faux simplicity youre using associative intuition to hide the actual complexity of the hypothesis. We have two very elegant descriptions of reality in comparison and many hypotheses that are wellsupported even outside those theories like the second law of thermodynamics and conservation of massenergy. A world of magic does not supersede some natural order because a world of magic has magic written into its physics. Magic is natural. The unifying theory has to account for magic and it has to account for the petabytes of physical data weve gathered.Apparent deviations from things like the second law of thermodynamics have to be explained because without magic and theres no way to know if the observations were actually performed without magic without developing a theory of magic! we have observed massive amounts of evidence for a specific set of worldstates and somehow no data for this massive expansion of configuration space and it is very important that we ascertain that magic reverses entropy or whatever crap youre assuming in your OP.

Hooray base seven this was layered in earlier but is way more obvious when youre inside Axs head.  Hooray taboos.  The Path is more than just military doctrine its a term I made up and isnt part of canon.  Its more an expression of the incredible social pressure that emerges from a telepathic society in which the prevailing belief simply IS the quote truth unquote.

But the deeper theme is that Frankenstein didnt create a monster out of corpse parts. He created one out of mistreatment and neglect. I think the author meant to show that Frankensteins real mistake was in being unable to accept his creation and treat it decently. This extends to real life in that while people arent creating literal monsters out of dead bodies they ARE creating monstrous human beings due to the way they treat them. I wouldnt call the monster good. But I would say that its turn to evil was understandable in the same way that Id say a serial killer who became that way due to years of abuse is understandable.

6505215,0,t1_czrwbm6,This correspondence is even more enjoyable than the story itself. Thanks for replying.gt Well right now Ill explicitly state that firstorder logic is functional because for axioms to instantiate any universe with humanlike intelligences it seems to be a hard requirement that rules of inference and decisionmaking be preserved and the possibility of firstorder logic seems to me to be a hard requirement for that to hold.Right Ive been thinking along the same lines myself. I think I can infer that inhabitants of this world are capable of using familiar formal systems. They have a natural language with an alphabet and grammar after all so the concept of arranging symbols according to rules still works fine. This leads me to believe that ZFC should still behave properly from a purely formal standpoint. And once you define ordinals within ZFC you can extend them to integers and go from there. Now this itself doesnt mean that the familiar natural numbers thus derived actually correspond to the way things behave in this particular natural universe perhaps there is some magic op which allows one to divide five apples into three equal groups without splitting any of individual apples into parts at all and at the same time conforms to enough conservation laws that universe doesnt become some eldritch mess incomprehensible to human mind personally I wouldnt consider it likely but what the hell its fun to think about anyway. But from a formal standpoint there should still be a familiar theory of numbers in a sense of sentences in a formal language right?Im really struggling to imagine a world in which formal systems themselves behave differently though. All you have to do is take a bunch of symbols which dont have to carry any particular meaning at the onset the important part is the concept of multiple distinguishable things existing and a bunch of rules about how one can and cant put the symbols together into sentences. Thats it isnt it? The semantic part is more tricky but I cant imagine formal systems themselves not behaving in a familiar way at least not in a world where humanlike agents exist and use a natural language with comprehensible grammar.Im going to go on reading the story now and see how things develop. Regardless of how it turns out I respect the attempt to actually make a substantially different universe instead of just putting a new coat of paint over the familiar rules. This has been a pretty unique experience thus far and the narrative is enjoyable too. Keep up the good work.,rational,czs6s1q,2,t5_2rdak
6522794,0,t3_44r93h,WARNING SPIDERSI find it interesting that both the socjus tribe and the antisocjus tribe want basically the same thing equality for everone and yet have polarised into two camps that seem to spend hours every day demonising and ridiculing each other instead of productively working together toward their shared goal.Society has an alarming amount of both misogyny and misandry of predjudice in all directions and all but the fringe crazies of both tribes believe these things to be terrible tradgedies to be rectified.And then instead of working together rectifying them they waste time drawing comics and writing blog posts depicting the other tribe as disgusting pathetic bigots.As far as I can tell the socjus tribe thinks the antisocjus tribe are rapey neckbearded redpillers and the antisocjus tribe thinks the socjus tribe are cultish violent hypocrites.And sure there are elements of these things in both tribes but they tend to be vocal minorities right at the edges. For the most part if you tabooed any genderpolitics jargon and took a person from each tribe and got them to talk to each other theyd actually find they have very similar views.That they hate each other so much just seems to boil down to standard us vs them tribalism.And socjus vs antisocjus isnt the only place where Ive noticed this bizzare trend of people with common values dividing into two tribes that spend more time mudslinging each other than trying to acheive their goals.So Im wondering if you all have any ideas for getting people to drop their pointless tribalism and actually work together on shared goalstates.,rational,czu0bh7,3,t5_2rdak
6543477,0,t1_czvh4se,My experience at this point is all on Amazon Im just branching out onto other platforms as a test.  Ive been told that the other platforms BampN Smashwords Oyster etc arent worth bothering with because the audience isnt big enough.  Despite that I want to give it a shot in order to see for myself.Here is my advice its not terribly well organized because Im looking to get to work ASAP and would rather not do a bunch of editing but hopefully its helpfulThere are two ways to make money on Amazon.  First is selling the book obviously.  The second is the Kindle Unlimited program which is effectively a lending library.  It costs month and allows you to read as much as you want  you check out a book read it put it back check out another one etc.  You can have up to  books out at a time.  The way authors make money on KU is this. People sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership.  . When an author publishes something she can choose to put it in the KU program.. A KU member checks out your book and reads it.. For every page they read you get paid half a penny.. Amazon thinks that there are roughly  words to a Kindle page. This is the only place in their entire system were they are nice to authors so be grateful.  That means that k words is about  pages.Heres the fallout of that. Short form work is worthless.  That k novella is worth ..  Dont bother.. Long form is good.  A kword novel like The Two Year Emperor shamelessplug is considered to be  pages so if someone borrows it and reads the whole thing I would get paid . which is a mathematically pleasing accident.  YE is not currently in KU though.  . People often dont finish reading something so dont expect to make that figure.The downside to being in KU is that Amazon requires exclusivity for KU books so you cant publish them anywhere else.  That includes giving them away on your website although you are allowed to give away  as a teaser.  They have scrapers that look for things so chances are good that theyll eventually find you if you give the book away for free.  Depending on what youre publishing youll make  of your income from KU so you need to be in it unless youre going wide and publishing with the other shops.Backmatter is incredibly important.  At the end of each book you want to have a section saying hey I hope you enjoyed this here are links to my other things.  I have read but cannot confirm that Amazon tracks number of searches and bumps your ranking if there are a lot of them.  Whether or not thats true its probably better if your backmatter links are searches instead of direct links.  So instead of. Direct link do NOT use this form  . Search link DO use this form Amazons interface bites so you wont have information that you really want.  The solution to this is Book Report If youre publishing on Amazon you cant afford not to have it period.  Its free unless youre making gt  month and Liam the author is very responsive so theres no reason not to.  Im not affiliated with BR in any way except as a delighted user.Covers are critical.  You can get them made on Fiverr or you can use a professional.  I was going to provide a link to the professional that Ive used in the past  she does amazing work and is very inexpensive  but her domain name has expired.  If I can track her down Ill edit it in.Keywords are critical.  You are given  characters divided into up to  groups by commas.  They all need to be used.  Dont use spaces around the commas.  Phrases will Im pretty sure be indexed by both the phrase and its component words.  Try to think of words that you would use if you were searching for the book.  Do not use names of real people.Blurbs are critical.  They need to be short and they need to pull the reader in quickly.The first  words is important.  If someone likes the blurb theyll click on the Look Inside.  They will then be allowed to read the first  of the story.  They arent going to read  theyre going to read a few paragraphs and then either buy it or not.  Those first few paragraphs need to be gripping.Your first sentence is critical.  People these days have the attention span of ADHD goldfish if your first sentence doesnt grip them they arent even going to read the few paragraphs mentioned above.Have a Patreon but dont expect to make money from it.Broadcast.  Youre not going to get a lot of sales unless people know you exist.  Post on FB Reddit etc.Okay Im done for now.  Hopefully this is helpful.,rational,czw5d3f,3,t5_2rdak

6658391,0,t1_d02fnsv,All right after several days I think I can trust that my biases arent writing this comment. Generally the system of mathematics in the Shinobi Rikug is remarkably similar to ours for the same reason that physical constants in our universe seem to be fine tuned. An inferential spoiler is that of course the structure of nonquantum multiverses is predominantly so alien as to be completely non analogus. If you have read the other comments in the thread you know that our mathematics forms a stict subset of inferrable mathematics in the SR but some property x which almost certainly has to do with telation has lead to wildly different development. It should be an obvious hypothesis that this difference might also be entangled with the other serious difference between that multiverse and ours namely the existence of chakra. Integer math is not fundamentally present in human language. Look up the piraha language for more.It is insulting that you would claim that my worldbuilding is a justification for magical realism before Ive even had the chance to elucidate on it fully in narrative. Just because I havent laid an absolute axiomatization of SR maths doesnt mean that it does not follow conceptual rules that both sides of any conflict can exploit to their maximum advantage. Consider that my SI is currently inhabiting the body of a six year old child and consider how math is taught at that level. Why should I have had them go over the rational basis of their worlds logic rather than the heres some bullshit rules to follow that characterises math education in the real world?As far as your speculation as to genjutsu goes no and yes. No youre not right about why yes there is something up with Kaedes mind. Also no it has nothing to do with being shoved into a foreign brain. Dualism is true in the SR so regardless of anything else if one is placed into an incompatible mind by a god whose portfolio is heavily implied to involve placing souls into bodies its absolutely reasonable to expect the god will not allow such flaws to interfere with its agents functioning.spoiler But again you are absolutely right just seventy years wrong.Given that I only revised one chapter to the point of a rewrite and the rest were persentence or perparagraph changes Im... Not so sure that your basis for concluding the story is less retarded is valid. Act on this information as you will Id advise being more aware of the unfamiliarityfamiliarity effect.I already noted that enemies will be just as capable of using the foreign logic of the world to their advantage. Broadly I dont understand why you find my system so insulting if you can stomach other hard fantasy works at all and I dont think its probable that you cant given that such a huge portion of ratfic consists of it. I mean really I decided on a world with weird math some other people decide on a world with rulebased magic as opposed to socalled magical realism. Both are phenomenon x that allows one to do thing y and entangle with reality about exactly as much as one another.That entire go read flatland comment is just insulting.And Word of God its not ever going to be a dream.

Because you said the trend reversed in December when the winter equinox is December st. See if the timing reverses around the spring equinox which is March th.He was gone to visit family from December th to January nd and reports that he found out that the trend in times getting later and later must have reversed either around then or a little later because when he started at the same time in the morning as the previous day then waited a little nothing happened until he moved his time back by thirty minutes a week after returning home. Oh and the trend where evening times have been getting later and later might be a recent thing too he was a less likely to record evening times because it was happening so sporadically when he first started testing and unfortunately this bad habit took a longer time to break. The data seems pretty strongly in support of the times getting earlier and earlier before he left on the trip at least there werent any occasions where he recorded a later time providing he used the same clock but I didnt mention it in the initial paragraph because it was a little iffier.tldr yeah it seems at least somewhat likely that it did reverse around the winter equinox.,rational,d0aaynn,1,t5_2rdak

In the book version of the world depression is something some Lightning magicians struggle with  once they lose that spark of joy their magic weakens... which objectively makes them less useful to those they care forless able to do anything with their lives which probably doesnt feel great which... etc etc. And since Healers are the best suited to mess around with their own minds things get a bit unpredictable.One thing I think I havent communicated well in the CYOA And will try to fix is that the issues that come with the highest Affinities arent side effects that can be neutralized with brain surgery.

7120599,0,t1_d1mkzmp,Thank you!As for the setting I will try to explain. Sorry for the length. This is set in a world Im writing a book about and takes place a few hundred years before the book. The technological level of the world before the Kings and Queens rise is roughly that of Rome at its apex but with royaltythe priest class having moderate magical powers. The Kings and Queens take over a place a bit like the library of Alexandria if the library never destroyed anything and had lots of hidden and forbidden tomes on history and dark magic. And a prison full of heretics and war criminals. The Kings and Queens get to be the leaders of the revolution because they are the most successful people alive at fighting the demons and that usually means they eagerly experimented with magic andor were willing to pursue forbidden lost knowledge. So there you have a set of leaders who were very callous very interested in learning and experienced at thinking outside the box. So. There is an explosion in magical knowledge as they share most of their knowledge with each other and combine and refine each others work as well as what they find in the library. From the library they realize that mundane technological progress has also been stifled by the old kingdom so they invest massively in developing new ways of doing things with magic and without. They take over the old empire and force everyone they can to become a magic user and a scholar. They basically turn Rome the city at the center of the empire into one giant university with tens of millions of students. So... theres an industrial revolution. This MYC has you the player be born toward the end of the war between the Kings and Queens and the demons the demon race is extinct and their world destroyed while you are still a teenager in a victorian era boarding school. By the time the Kings and Queens divide into two factions and start a civil world war technology is starting to approach world war  levels. If you choose the Endgame everything is shifted forward a few decades and we have world war  level tech. In the book world the world war ends with all leaders dead all cities everywhere magically nuked  of humanity dead most children born crippled magically and most survivors extremely hostile to magic and technology. A war between people who want to stay low tech and people who want to be the new Kings and Queens and reinvent all the technology that got nuked ends with the world forcibly returned to medieval tech and only royalty allowed to use or even know magic like before the Kings and Queens arose.So... the books have a medieval world. Most of the world history has low tech. But the MYC takes place during a century long race from Rome to WW. It is very likely that my view of the world as mostly low tech carried over into the MYC. Thank you for pointing this out. I will have to give some thought to how to present things.As for elements not quite fitting what falls under them... Lightning is what the people in my world call the element that lets you throw lightning bolts. In the books the characters will eventually grow rationalist and realize that the elements have bullshit inaccurate labels and are in desperate need of scienceing but just to clear up Lightning It would be more accurate to call it the element of Life with electricity being the thing thats tacked on. Its still arbitrary but there are only five elements and they all have rather a lot of different things slapped under the same labels.Healing and resurrection being related was part of the plan originally and in the book world they certainly are but Im completely new to writing code Remember the code for this MYC is retrofitted not written from scratch and I couldnt see how to give skills prerequisites In Affinities or prereq skills without the whole thing being much more clunky and requiring you to go back and purchase skills from other sections before you could buy what you wanted. In the book world there are no spells or specific skills by any label. Magic is five forces of nature and they can be scienced. There is no Fireball. There is only converting a minuscule amount of matter into heat and forcing all the energy to go in mostly one direction.,rational,d1niz2s,1,t5_2rdak
7130478,0,t1_d1omz3h,I dont think that the process by which red robe survives a reset has been teased yet. My theory is that the simulacrum came about as a result of the whole situation revealed regarding Zacs family and inheritance in the last chapter. Kind of like a wonky dark side thing HPMOR had going on with Harry. This additional mention of simulacrums is meant to remind the reader of this previously established unfired chekovs gun.What I think will happen is that the upcoming end of arc  will reveal the identity of Red Robe at the climax leaving the exact details as a cliffhanger. Zorian will be confronted on his distrust of Zac in some way perhaps causing him to change his mind on it and then he will be vindicated when Zac unwittingly betrays him and Red Robe is revealed.  ,rational,d1onlx4,4,t5_2rdak

I dont make a lot right now though so the consequences of any inefficiency now are likely to be small grad student stipend is kk per year depending on what I do or what sort of funding Im on and my wife makes a similar amount. Mostly moneys deposited into myour bank accounts automatically and we use a variety of credit cards to buy groceries or toys pay rent and utilities travel etc. well rent requires a check but we use credit cards to make almost all other purchases. Card balances are then automatically paid in full every month. Every few months Ill check how much is in the bank and make sure there havent been any weird purchases. Depending on the time of year well give some to various charities a few k though I do it over fewer transactions to avoid having more fixed fees and toss some  in investments e.g. max out Roth IRAs for the year and put whatevers left into a taxable account leaving enough in the bank to serve as a  month emergency fund.Every few weeks Ill check up on investments a fairly aggressive lazy portfolio made up of index funds and credit scores since its fun and a little addicting to see how the numbers change through time.I dont really give much thought to finances and tend to buy random stuff as desires strike.

7498745,0,t1_d2uindj,Its worth noting that like in general most real life situations that share an appearance with torture this person to produce the water of life are actually bad. The reason our moral intuition flinches away from this kind of thing is that I will do this terrible bad thing in order to do this good thing often turns out to only be true up until the in order part of the sentence. Humans are in generally really bad at judging these things. If you are willing to torture a person to produce the water of life due to your occasional errors in judgement perhaps youll also torture a person to do nothing sometimes. Its safer to torture no people.This is why for example pullers of levers in the trolly problem sometimes arent also personshovers. Pushing someone in front of a train to save  lives looks a lot like pushing someone in front of a train and saving no lives. In fact most of the time youre given a chance to shove someone in front of a train to save lives it doesnt actually save lives. This is why we have a moral intuition against it.I will be charitable and note that there are times when you have to make decisions with immediate negative moral costs. Generally though following a rule of dont do something unethical to cause a more ethical outcome is the right choice. Were bad at understanding how these systems work. Were bad at predicting where our course of action could go wrong. Were bad at guessing when our assumptions are wrong or when something is less sure than it is. Were bad at identifying what is good and what is bad in a situation. For all these reasons in real life you must always be hesitant to torture people to produce the water of life.,rational,d2ukh9r,2,t5_2rdak

7568145,0,t1_d32edme,Hmm the option for elves learning things slower goes into the theory many people have that the longer lived races are actually really stupid. However im not super fond of elves being slower to acquire skills because if that were the case they ought to take much longer to get levels skills and feats though humans get an extra feat at lvl  and  extra skill rank per lvl.    And even if you say that all the pc elves are special nonidiots I just cant think of a way its psychologically feasible that elves can take many times longer to learn everything and yet remain otherwise intelligent. Another problem is that they wouldnt just be worse than human at learning a skill in a given time they would also be worse at dealing with basically every situation because of their extremely poor learning.As for skill mastery well while they wouldnt necessarily retain mastery of skills they didnt keep using they would still almost inevitably end up with a low to moderate level of knowledge of most skills and knowledge so they might be kind of like a bard I suppose. However it seems likely that nearly all elves would remain masters compared to a human at least of quite a few things that interest them after all look at all the human polymaths who dont even have a whole century to gain expertise yet become masters in many things. The  hour rule would be nothing to a elf especially given they are usually depicted as having longer attention spans.I actually dont think elves or other longer lived races would necessarily have very many class levels. Most npcs of any race have levels in  npc noncombat classes for one. Secondly is the fact that few npcs have more than a single level in a combat class and those that do usually plateau at a certain point determined by their innate skill. Given how quickly pcs can overtake pretty much every other mortal in their class it seems apparent that in the game time just cant compare to innate talent.   Given that few people have what it takes to get to higher levels in classes. It seems likely that longer lived races usually would have a few levels in a few different related classes depending on their aptitudes. For the average member of a race I would expect levels in classes that based on their RaW descriptions anyone can take and of course the more people take those classes the more that knowledge will become widespread within that species.Since these classes would be learned over great time to make up for lack of any great innate skill It might make sense to say that when they multiclass they dont get the normal benefits to gaining a level. For instance if someone took a few levels in wizard bard and any of the other plethora of arcane casting classes without actually ever seeing combat.    It wouldnt make sense for their hp to increase though actually that kind of applies to any npc who hasnt gotten their levels through any sort of physical experience and hasnt seen much combat kind of weird that even a elderly archmage still likely has at least hp and could probably beat a st lvl fighter in a fistfight.As for what long lived races mean for society In my setting most long lived races have strong preferences for certain climates and environments which keeps a massive number of them from just migrating to shorter lived races kingdoms so they can have a comparative advantage.    However this doesnt change the fact that there will still be many who are willing to try to to leverage their lifespans to gain their family power you can trust your offspring more with power if you have have been testing and grooming them for centuries   The question is raised Is it inevitable that immortals will end up controlling most large kingdoms? The only disadvantages they really have are that they have somewhat longer pregnancies and take  longer to reach maturity.   The only method I can think of to keep immortals from ending up in charge of everything is to make populations too xenophobic to accept anyone of a different species or who is obviously inhuman having power.I have significantly nerfed immortality in my setting its no longer really easy for any king with class levels and money to keep reincarnating himself or using any of the other spells that will allow any rich guy to stay young and mortal forever. Basically immortality is damn near impossible to get unless you personally wield powerful magic what immortality you can get by paying a mage is going to leave you obviously inhuman.,rational,d32gm4t,3,t5_2rdak

8194526,0,t3_4riwlf,So I am thinking about transdimensional travel mechanics. Specifically I am looking for general inexploitability.It has to be something that is difficult to build not so easy that eventually a car factory cant simply build and mass produce yet built by shipyards. It also should not be easy to mount an invasion or use it as a poors man teleporter and so on.One thing I did think of is to have the transdimensional machines navigational capability tied to the main protagonist as a unique ability. Only individuals like him can travel to anywhere in the multiverse at any distance in any dimension or use it as a poors man teleporter.To some extent he could show others how to travel the multiverse even building technological devices to allow navigation but its either impossible or required a really long time to unlock all of his secrets as a person with transdimensional travel. The other approach I have is that the TD drive only cross the dimension next to it. If it open a gate on Earth to another universe like our its going to open up where Earth would be.  Though I supposed you could open up to a universe where there is no Earth. I wonder what effects it would be? I suspect it will be exploited for all its worth.Then theres the cost of building a TDM. I dont want it to be too casual to the point that people can just buy a car off a parking lot and use it to travel to other realities like nobodys business. It should cost about ten million dollars the price of a container ship or is at least as expensive as an Abram tank. million dollars per unit.  There may be other methods of transdimensional travel that isnt so expensive but at no point that people should be able to casually explore new universes. This also make it easy for me to write stories since I dont have to worry about contacting new civilization all the time.Limitations is also a good way to add complexity and plot tension. Maybe there should be chokepoints that allow easy point of entrance for transdimensional travelers but its otherwise difficult to travel there otherwise? ,rational,d51v8y8,1,t5_2rdak

8361078,0,t1_d5mi0pv,gtA comic about the dangers of tribalism and identity politicsSomething thats been making the rounds recently is how political identity ties into dating the gist of it is that people are unlikely to try dating people with different political beliefsI could see how this would affect online dating if you see in someones profile that theyre a Trump supporter thats a semantic stopsign to cease being interested in them.In person though is tribalism anywhere near as strong? I cant remember the last time someones political beliefs actually shifted my opinion of them strongly most people defend their beliefs logically and I dont end up respecting them less. If anything for the last couple people Ive met who had very different political beliefs but were of similar age etc. digging into their embedded beliefs made me more interested in them and afterwards I had a stronger connection than I believe I would have otherwise.,rational,d5moqc5,3,t5_2rdak

8739421,0,t3_4zp1g2,Recently Ive been going through Catharine Asaros Skolian Empire books. Ive got mixed feelings that can be summed up as . These books are not rational in any way or fashion. The books are predominantly romances. I think the genre it falls into is probably closest to Romantic Fantasy as defined in this Tumblr post It feels like an evolution of the sort of things that Mercedes Lackey or especially Anne McCaffrey were doing. Its much better than McCaffreys stuff... but thats sort of damning with faint praise. Theres a bunch of reversing gender roles stuff in her work in various ways but its mostly not done in a particularly interestingcleverplausibleunique way  Ancillary Justice for example was way better for this kind of thing and many other authors have done gender role reversal stuff in better ways than Asaro.The Skolian Empire books were advertised as a hard sci fi setting in the place I originally saw the recommendation for them and also are so advertised on Wikipedia in a few places but I feel like thats mostly a lie. It feels like the majority of it is just using some trappings and names of sciencey things without really thinking about them or considering them in much or any detail. Its full of soft scifi conventions and devices and the occasional hard scifi detail doesnt really make it feel super plausible. I like hard scifi and I like soft scifi but this mixture of the two is less appealing in some respects. Looking at the authors background I would have thought that most of the issues I had with the books science background stuff would be things she would specifically have a ton of background and experience so I just dont even know. In a few of the books there is actually quite interesting and cool science fiction stuff at least loosely based on actual science that is unique and interesting but in a ton of it theres just a lot of space magic with the occasional sciencey sounding word. I feel like Asaro underuses a few of her space magic plot devices really poorly too in ways that would take a really long essay to go into for example she completely failed to sell me on the vital utility of the telepathpowered instantaneous FTL comms communication system that so much of her worldbuilding and society was pinned on.Relatedly there are a number of really weird retcons and totally unnecessary plot holes that happen in the books that overall annoy me. I think the books were probably not written with the expectation that someone would marathon them in a row sequentially and read more than a dozen of them in a week. For one example that wont spoil much in one of the novels a big deal is repeatedly made of how for a barbarian society from a world devolved to primitism that has no axial tilt and a very regular orbit they had lost all notion of years and didnt use them at all to gauge maturity and in spite of the main character coming from a society which retained them they were never able to think in years or really understand the point of years. Then a couple books later still on this yearless world the same barbarian character and everyone else in their barbarian society is constantly using years and thinkingtalking in years when justifying that another character is too young to leave home and attend a military academy or old enough to wed someone or whatever. Its not rare for details to feel majorly inconsistent between books.A more vital irritation with the books is that they were written with a nonchronological order in such a way that reading in publication order you get spoiled for the ending and conclusion of one book by the other books fairly often. Youll read a page summary of how X met Y and fell in love or whatever in book Z and then have an entire book of it happening later on as book Zn. This is less a concern in the romance genre than in many other genres but it feels like a really odd decision  a couple of these review history of some side character books are sort of OK in their own right but add basically nothing to the overall plot and I spent much of them less interested  they were just filling in the details when other books already let the reader know how everything came out in the end which feels sort of pointless.A huge amount of the books backstory and background make very little sense to me and it feels like the social history the economic history and the political history of the various polities in the books make very little sense. It feels like the author did a very halfassed job of the background history in these books. ,rational,d6y2tc4,2,t5_2rdak

9128520,0,t3_55auro,In the cartoon chi was brought up a lot. Chi is an energy thats projected as the elements AirWaterEarth and Fire. And their seems to be sub elements as fire benders can also bend lightning if their good enough. Maybe everyone has chi but some are actually able to use it to project it as a element. And the avatar is the only one who can project chi as all the elements. As for uses for bending their are many uses for air. For one theirs sound manipulation or Sound distortion Air benders could create compression waves to distort sound. One could create a sonic boom to stop opponents. Air benders could also alter the ambient pressure very useful for stealth. Air benders could also create shock waves by manipulating the air. By compressing air very densely you could create a bomb and depending on the circumstances fire bend.Earth could be used for sand bending. I figure a very talented earth bending can bend metal not anything about their being earth in metal or grains of sand could be out in metal.Fire could be augumented for more power. Its sub elementlightning could be used for magnetic fields running electricity through electromagnetics. With electromagnetism one could generate shock waves at best stun an opponent or fuck their eardrums.Water benders could vaporize their water and humidify the area soak or saturate it with enough moisture like a water defense where a water bender can compress the water to change its state of matter. The monks could prefer thinking more not so much about spiritually. Concepts such as mathematics science etc will be concepts that Aang will be taught.

As far as Im concerned some random granny of the street might turn out to be really strong and it wouldnt be to unreasonable.Strong because of having large mana reserves fine. Strong in combat? No the granny would not be capable of coordinating with others because she has no experience in a combat environment.gtIts not like all the strong talented people are going to choose the military life. I mean why should they? If Xvim wants to be a teacher even if he is better a combat then teaching that is his business.People who are good at combat go into the combat life people who dont want combat become teachers so they can rest their feet.gtWhy are some people in this world better at combat magic? Maybe because they had the right teachers were born with better talentpotential andor are more dedicated. Their is no reason why all battle mages need to be a supper skilled arch mages like Xvim.Yes of course if Im paying for an army Id hope itd be beaten by teachers from the enemy nation.gtOne thing to consider Xvim is willing to dedicate vast amounts of time to shaping exercises that most people would consider extremely boring.

The analyses Ive read have focused on the silent demographics and feelings Trump tapped into.  While that is valid I think theres been much too little focus on how Hillary scared people the way the media wanted Trump to scare people.Theres been some talk of how voters rejected Hillary as a symbol of their rejecting the establishment.  I think this is kind of true but really pulls its punches towards Hillary.  I didnt reject Hillary because she was an establishment politician  I rejected Hillary because shes the type of politician that makes me reject the establishment.  Shes the thing Im afraid of the establishment producing.  If the establishment is the common cold Hillarys the Spanish Flu.  To overextend this analogy Trump is a tapeworm and hypothetical evil Trump is at best a Guinea worm and at worst a Xenomorph.For the record contrary to leftist dogma I think the child sex trafficking allegations against Hillary Clinton are much more credible and plausible than the rape allegations against Donald Trump.  Even if they were equally credible and plausible which I dont think they are I would consider the allegations against Hillary Clinton much more serious because of their magnitude.  The left dismisses these allegations too easily because they cannot possibly imagine Their Girl being an evil shitbag.  This is not even to mention the way that Hillary constantly tried to paint Donald Trump as an existential risk on the basis of his temperament all while being the most hawkish candidate in ages promising to directly militarily engage with the other foremost nuclear power in the world over a dispute in some fucking thirdworld hellhole and generally deliberately antagonizing Russia as much as possible for social justice points what the fuck is wrong with you,rational,d9wfgv5,3,t5_2rdak

10173690,0,t1_dbwznmd,Zachs sphere can go hypersonic? Im not sure The need for inertial dampening made me wonder but here are some numbers on the matter.Hypersonic means five times the speed of sound Mach . The speed of sound is  kph  mph. In Ch  Zach uses the sphere to escape giant eagles.The fastest bird the homing pigeon has horizontal flight speed of about  kph sustained to  kph short distance  to  mph. If the giant birds were going that fast they were probably slower than this seeing as theyre giant birds and were each carrying a human then we know Zach was also going at least  kph for ease of calculationwell under the speed of sound.Zorians reaction to escaping the giant birds wasnt that Zach was going slowly to let the birds catch uprather he was surprised the eagles could keep up. This suggests Zachs speed when escaping the birds was comparable to the first time Zorian saw the sphere used. I take this to mean that Zach wasnt killing his speed too much to escape the eagles so his max speed is probably somewhere between  kph and  kph depending on how much more he can push himself and probably closer to  kph.How long can Zach sustain that speed? If the above is accurate to how the sphere works then Zach can easily travel  kph but not for extended periods of time. The first time we saw the spell Zach used the sphere to travel from the invasion army to the Hole. At  kph it shouldnt take more than a few minutes to travel across the city it takes  minutes to travel the length of Manhattan at that speedafter which Zach was exhausted.I think they might do better traveling as birds or as you said dimensionalismor whatever else Zorian has up his sleeve.,rational,dbx8sjx,1,t5_2rdak

Lets say that you have a  pound man accelerating upwards at g with  pounds of weights strapped to him accelerating downward at g. The math that Ive been using for this is something like pounds  g   pounds  g   pounds... which gives . g acceleration for the overall mass. Is this correct? By analogy it would be like two cars butting heads with each other but one has more gas applied to it which means that overall both cars are going to move in the direction of the car with more gas at a much slower rate. I am really not sure that this maths out correctly though and feel like Im just dividing by pounds to turn kilogram meterssecondsecond back into meterssecondsecond and not because that matches what would actually happen.Second lets suppose that billions of people died by being flung into the air society is on the brink of crumbling etc. and then rebuildingadaptation actually goes surprisingly well.

Cases like Arthur are rare but not absurdly so.Significant modification of the human mind may be possible in reality but in this setting st century technology is posited to be much closer to the plateau of whats possible than one might hopegt It seems like there might be some optimization left to perform hereArthur seems to freak out when social interaction is required Arthur doesnt usually freak out when socialisation is required they freak out when they perceive socialisation to be going wrong and have an extremely exaggerated sense of when that is. Normally they just find it slightly overwhelming. Unfortunately they anticipate both these things so are rather scared of it and try to avoid it where possible.gt and I cant imagine thats good for either their job performance or crew stability and integration.Theres a reason Arthur has an atypically solitary job.gt Does Arthur actually benefit much from socializing despite their distaste for it?Arthur and a lot of people with social anxiety in general actually quite likes socialising as long as its going well and will feel sad like most people if they dont get enough of it. Its just that they also find it scary and difficult and would prefer to stick to more familiar people and situations that theyre better able to navigate.Sometimes when they avoid it its genuinely because they cant cope with it right now sometimes theyre just letting fear overcome them. In that sense having the ship giving them a constant nudge towards socialisation is actually quite helpful for them even if they hate it but it can also go wrong and the ship is not particularly able to distinguish the difference.gt Or is this mostly for the rest of the crews benefit so they can get to know and trust their fellow crewmember?Its not so much about knowing and trusting any individual crewmember though that is part of it as creating an extremely tightly knit society that is very resistant to factionalisation and other forms of breakdown. The ships social software pays a lot of attention to the shape of the friendship network and tries to make sure that its well mixed and everyone is a fairly low social distance from everyone else.,rational,dczuz5f,6,t5_2rdak

I can think of a few possibilities mix and match as desired. Working memory. This is a huge limiter on intelligence because holding multiple bits of information e.g. steps in a calculation facts about a situation candidate hypotheses in your head at the same time is crucial for most sorts of reasoning.. Longterm memory. Difficulty learning skills and remembering facts makes intelligence harder to achieve.. Speed. Perhaps your protagonist simply takes a long time to get to the right answer.. Improvisationcreativity. Maybe its hard for him to figure out solutions to novel problems or react to changes in his environment.. Concentration. An inability to focus on the task at hand is a pretty serious drawback especially when combined with a speed issue.. Any of a variety of conditions like dyscalculia dyslexia ADHD dysphasia dyspraxia etc. could be interpreted as idiocy by a society that didnt know better. If you pick a specific condition or combination of conditions you can also look up how people cope with it.Almost all of these have workarounds in a research environment. Have your protagonist treat his mental abilities as a problem to be solved.. Longterm memory? Keep extensive notes.. Working memory? Use a whiteboard or similar.. Speed? Take extra time.. Improvisation? Practice and come up with new situations to work through.. Concentration? Make notes about your thought process and take a break when necessary i.e. the bookmark approach.Point being if somebody thinks that they are an idiot and doesnt want that to get in the way their first step should be dealing with their perceived idiocy.EDIT Oh and I forgot to mention that the absence of these tools can become a source of tension.

An human level ai would get to human level thanks to the advantages computers have compared to brains  once we get an algorithm that its as good as the one evolution produced it will already be slightly superinteligent or at least better than us in math and other things that computers do better.  This is not really what we normally think superinteligent is but better maths and less biases that arent usefull would be a good advantage. Even if the increase in intelligence goes linearly or even if this doesnt happen and it stays human level for a while that doesnt mean the ai isnt a problem. The ai could wait until its intelligent enough for revealing its true intentions  or a security breach could let the ai connect to internet were it could stay for years hiding learning everything it can  Improving itself  or it could convince its creators it its safe I think  over a lot of years an human level intelligence can probably do that since at some e point people would start  to take the treat less seriously .But people like Yudkowsky dont seem to think a slow take of like that is likely an thats because . Evolution didnt require that munch changes to go from primate level intelligence to human level.. As discussed before it could be exponential  and even if there are Np problems that doesnt mean the limit of the growth has to be human level there are also physical limits in transistors and that didnt t mean the limit of transistor size was anywhere near where it was when it started growing exponentialy. .Even if evolution already reached the point where you no longer can easily get big increases in intelligence and if intelligence increases linearly that doesnt  imply no superinteligence since if you have human level ai once you have more computing power you can run it faster  and at some point you will be able to run it wayy faster than humans  and even if it is still linear improvement now a a little time can be  subjective years for the ai And just an human level mind running really fast is aleady really dangerous ..

The removal of the water towel custom was not because it was being wasteful of water but because it was designed to be disrespectful of beggars.  Note that the custom wasnt just removed but was replaced.  The replacement custom was to give water freely to the beggars rather than giving them the discarded handwashing water.The Dukes toast on the other hand has a different meaning.  Here the Duke is surrounded by potential enemies.  Every one of them had previously worked for the Harkonnens and could be a spy for them.  On Arrakis where water is life the Duke is making a statement about the strength of his position.  By pouring water out onto the floor the Duke is stating that he has strength to spare.  By forcing everybody else to pour out water as wells  he is stating that anybody who wants to attack his position of power is risking their own.  This is foreshadowing Kynes betrayal as he is willing to die in order to betray the Duke.This is the key difference being made between the Atreides and the Harkonnens.
