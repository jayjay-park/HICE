8932550,0,t3_52i20s,My bookmark didnt work I had to update it.Ashas position is a bit understandable. In an universe where magicians and fighters seem to be the only ones to hold any position of note not having any possibility of rising to their ranks at all must be very frustrating. Of course that doesnt excuse killing people... But Visnu goaded her and he knew she would accept. Maybe she realized this was a selffulfilling prophecy?I wonder what Visnu made her see.,Kubera,d7lk6u8,3,t5_2whun
