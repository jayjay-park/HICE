266365,0,t3_1x5ruo,I remember when i was a kid to tune everyday pokemon and i loved the series more and more but i never knew there were videogames. On christmas my dad brought me a GBA which he said he found a man and told him it was for me It was on christmas so i was shitting myself so once my dad gives it to me he tells me that the man hided the game because he thought it shouldnt be so easy to me so i found it after  hours of nonstop searching and i found the game My first pokemon game pokemon FireRed and i couldnt believe it my favorite series had a videogame! So i started with a Charmander like any other kid but i was very dissapointed of not having it say Char! but i decided to advance in the game every place was a deja vu i didnt saw the dungeon of lt surge but the ground stage of the series and i was incredibly amazed i think i didnt slept that day XD. However when i arrived to the elite four it became more difficult but i defeated them! And then... BLUE or as i called him gary. It was a difficult fight and my charizard defeated  of his pokemon but finally my pikachu defeated blastoise and i was amazed i WAS THE POKEMON CHAMPION! So when the game credits arrived i was sad because i finished the game so i closed my GBAand i left it until  months later my brother finds it and says to me that professor oak told him there were more things to do...And this was my infancy sorry for the long story P but i got really excited of remembering it  I think its obvious my favorite game is pokemon firered version and even though it had happen  years since i got my firered version i still have it in my drawer right next to me as i write it my ony surviving toy of my infancy and what an infancy it was.,Pokemongiveaway,cf8da2m,1,t5_2ub11

393920,0,t3_1ylgad,Oh man.. hoo. Hard choice to make here. Id have to say Jintan Yadomi from Anohana. Im gonna assume you havent watched it to avoid spoilers.I like Jintan as a character a whole lot. He goes from that outgoing rowdy kid leader to an introverted shutin who doesnt even attend high school. Looking at his kid self youd think hed grow up to be one of those popular kids.. but he doesnt. Hes become a shell of his former self and its interesting to watch him slowly grow back into himself as Anohana progresses. Maybe hell never be that same fieryhearted kid again but at least he gains back the support of his friends.I identified with him a lot for personal reasons even though our circumstances were different. I mean hes anime and Im a d girl lol. Also Anohana is a fantastic anime in general.Thanks for hosting this giveaway! ,Pokemongiveaway,cfllgn5,1,t5_2ub11

519652,0,t3_202sb3,Rotom. His many forms will be useful during many situations. Too warm eg. volcano gt fridge. Too cold gt oven. Dirty cloths thirsty gt washing machine.Tropius infinite bananas for keeping my strength up. Also I can ride him around the island he can learn cut to chop down nasty trees and wutnut.Steelix. Hes not affected by hurricanes because of his weight and dual resistance to flying. He can also provide a nice shelter during the night. ,Pokemongiveaway,cfzc72a,1,t5_2ub11
519937,0,t3_202sb3,RotomW the ultimate sweeper hes superbly over powered he has an extremely high special attack he can clean up most of the elite four with his electric and water moves. But if that doesnt get you this will. Three words miniwashingmachine. Yup you heard it. Mini Washing machine. The cutest killing machine youve ever seen. Plus it scares the shit out of the elite four they came here to battle and you suddenly throw out a home appliance. AAAAAnd if that doesnt get you he has a little door where he shoots water out of awwwwwwwwwwww.

537867,0,t1_cg1b1ul,I guess you didnt see my reply to Happiny.Banning outright has more weight in true trading subs.  But here trades are oneway.  The giving party has no expectations.People who are doing giveaways and are giving out the pokemon that arent what say they are yes they are scammers and should be banned.  Because the receivers were expecting something.  And giveaways that were legitimate mistakes should be able to appeal.  In your example they may be new users that dont quite understand how IVs work.What about uUlquiorraSchiffers country analogy doesnt make sense?  Each country has their own laws.  You arent punished in a country that you didnt commit the offense.  Youre punished in the country you did commit it in.  Each sub has their own rules.That being said for those on other banlists that request here and receive from giveaways rather than being banned outright perhaps there should be a bot that just comments that they are on a banlist.  The mods are making sure that people are informed and can then choose to ignore or helpgiveaway.People can specify requirements like linking to a giveaway they held so I dont see a problem with you specifying no people who are on a banlist.,Pokemongiveaway,cg1eutp,1,t5_2ub11

702001,0,t3_227gak,gt I dont want anything in return but Im definitely gonna prioritize people who attach a Heart Scale or Rare Candy.Hey stating that youre going to prioritize people if they have an item is pretty much hinting at people to attach an item if they want their Pokemon. I understand that you stated that you dont want anything in return but that is practically forcing people to give you an item for a guaranteed Pokemon. Thats not what we do here.  Rule  Giveaways are ONLY Giveaways no asking for anything in return that defeats the purpose. This includes everything from pokemon to karma to favors. All giveaways must also take place within this sub. Trying to advertise by getting people to visit another site or take part in some task is not allowed. All contests should be done here.Also Illumise are rare encounters on Route . It doesnt have to be unique if youre looking through the GTS. You can spot them if they give you their IGN and upload something like a Bidoof or Fletchling. It doesnt have to be incredibly unique to be honest the more unique it is the more chance of it getting sniped. ,Pokemongiveaway,cgk2j7r,4,t5_2ub11

966558,0,t3_2567o1,. Thanks to all of you wonderful people. The fact that this community exists has really inspired me to get really into bank ball breeding and competitive and EM and all the details that I didnt care about until a few months ago. I dont think I would ever have gone to the trouble of breeding a heavy ball version of my favorite Gyarados without you.. When a new game comes out I play for the story. And then the other  I play to breed and enjoy the postgame and do cool trades with people that make us both happy.. The colors. The wings. The wizards eyestalk. The POWER. But seriously my second favourite Gen  after Darmanitan. He is a musthave on any Unova team.Thanks for running the contest. That goat is a looker.,Pokemongiveaway,che5o2j,1,t5_2ub11

996802,0,t1_chhjzpn,Just a heads up you cant ask for specific IVs hereRule  Be reasonable. We shouldnt see any requests for shinies foreign dittos events legendaries Battle MaisonShop items or mega stones here. Pokemon cannot be requested to have any specific IVs perfect or otherwise hidden powers egg moves etc. Natures and Abilities can be suggested but not demanded.You might get lucky and someone will offer you one with some perfect IVs they have left from breeding but if not try heading over to rpokemontrades you can trade a variety of things like BP items and shinies for decent IVd pokemon there and of course competitive pokemon for competitive pokemon so even if you dont have spare pokemon to trade there might be something else you can offer for a competitive honedge. Keep an eye out for honedge giveaways here too since the pokemon youll find there most often have decent IVs. Good luck! ,Pokemongiveaway,chhldvg,-1,t5_2ub11

1045938,0,t1_chn1h06,I always use my Thundurus as a lead or antilead on my competitive teams! Along with priority taunt being able to stop other leads that set up hazards and boosts Ive built a second strategy around this guy to counter other boosters and outright sweep other teams. Right before Thundurus faints use priority thunder wave to slow a boosted threat such as mega scizor. Switch in an imposter ditto and unleash havoc as you turn the opponents boosted sweeper against them! I love how many dcs this causes as ditto wrecks through opposing teams with their own trump card. Plus thundurus special attack and speed make him one of the strongest electric attackers out their along with being one of the fastest pranksters. Finally  I love Thunduruss new battle animation! If you wait long enough you can watch as Thundurus rolls back his arms getting ready to dish out tons of pain on your opponent.Thundurus is also very versatile in being able to set up rain again to make sure you dont lose the weather warI live in PST too My StrategyThundurus Prankster  Life Orb Timid  Speed amp Sp.

1116562,0,t3_26wqkt,Did you know there once was a lonely electivire up in the mountains of sinnoh? He lived there all by himself after his trainer left him because he didnt have the perfect IV spread. This electivire trained so hard that the other pokemon began to worship him as a godlike creature. Through hard work and a lot of sweat and tears he managed to build a small community of pokemon and together they decided they wanted to take on the pokemon league. They kidnapped a young child from nearby and put him in the back of the party. Then a zoroark went ahead and magicly transformed in the young boy. He bought some pokeballs and all of electivires friends got a comfy ball. They traveled around the region earning badges and after some time they were ready to challenge the league. When they went through victory road they got lost and after a while the child starved and died. rumor has it electivire and co are still roaming in victory road waiting for another trainer to snatch up and continue their quest. Its just a rumor though..,Pokemongiveaway,chv7o86,1,t5_2ub11

1220514,0,t3_282fm1,. Looking forward to all the new megas and seeing Hoenn in D but Im mostly hyped for the memories. Hoenn is where my journey or career or adventure as a Pokemon player started. To this day its my favorite region. I love the landmarks the gym leaders the teams and now Aqua is an allblack team so turn up and riding around on the mach and acro bikes. Seeing it in D will bring a completely new dimension heh to the game and I just cant wait. Oh and Battle Frontier gotta love it!. Shiftry I even thought out a detailed new movepool and stat spread for a Mega Shiftry here. Apparently we might even be getting Shiftryite in ORAS so fingers crossed.. I really liked using Relicanth back in rd gen. Its shiny is sick and it seems kind of important since you need it for finding the Regi trio. Still using it in X and Y today bc banded Rock Head Head Smashes are too bae. ,Pokemongiveaway,ci6xclf,1,t5_2ub11

1296366,0,t3_28xly2, My most memorable moment was in fact not an achievement but a failure. I was young and stupid then and replaying Pokemon Diamond. I was just exploring and I passed through some tall grass and unluckily ran into a wild Pokemon. It was a Ralts and it made a weird sparkle and was blue. It was late at night I was super tired in a rush and I was pretty much a Pokeretard at that time SO I RAN AWAY FROM THAT SHINY RALTS. I still cringe at the thought. It was only after consulting my far more experienced friend when I learned what a shiny Pokemon was. I have always wished for a spinoff or integrated aspect of Pokemon where I get to play the game from the antagonist point of view i.e. on Team XXXs side. How totally badass would it be if you get to actually say Yes to the leader of the Team when he inevitably asks you if you would like to join him? But I understand that programming this into a main series Pokemon game would be hell and probably technologically impossible so I propose a spinoff where you start the game as a Team XXX grunt. That would be wicked cool it will not only give depth to the villainous team it will really allow you to see Pokemon from a whole new perspective.. Freaking Raichu. Pikachu is already the mascot of Pokemon. Yet it sucks. Even its evolution sucks. Raichu is an extremely subpar Pokemon outshined by the likes of Jolteon and other better Pokemon. Raichu needs a stat buff and then a Mega. Come on Gamefreak you made Pikachu your mascot why not let its evolved form shine competitively to live up to his legacy? Playing competitive in a metagame that disincludes Pikachu just seems wrong. Pokemon doesnt feel like Pokemon without Pikachu or its evolutions. At least make it Eviolite usable.  ,Pokemongiveaway,cifgi0q,1,t5_2ub11

1297161,0,t3_28xly2,. What is your most memorable Pokemon moment i.e. catching your first shiny beating the Elite Four for the first time and why?Back in the original Redblue games there was an NPC who would trade you a Jynx for a Slowbro. I caught a pretty low level Slowpoke and spent maybe two straight hours or something raising it so itd evolve. When it finally did I went to that NPC and made the trade... but I remember distinctly that I felt very sad that my Slowbro was gone forever after Id spent so long raising it. I guess I was surprised how quickly I had bonded with it.. If you can add one new feature to Pokemon to make it more interesting what addition would you make?Ever since Pokemon Stadium  Ive desperately wished that when a Pokemon evades an attack itd show that Pokemon actually hopping out of the way instead of just nothing happening. Just that little bit of suspense would be pretty cool in battles I think.. Which Pokemon in your opinion should have its stats increased to make it usable in battles and why?Even though Wonder Guard is amazing and all Shedinja is... well awfully slow. I understand its the ghost of a bug but it couldve at least been a bit faster than it is. Then again though I dont battle competitively so maybe its just fine the way it is.. Im thinking of a number between   .Id offer feedback but I have none to be honest... but thanks for holding this giveaway!,Pokemongiveaway,cifjpwo,1,t5_2ub11

1424538,0,t3_2afmvt,Im a terrible artist. And I do have no paper in the house to draw on. So I did it in MS Paint! With a mouse! Behold!Diancie,Pokemongiveaway,ciuud81,1,t5_2ub11
1424623,0,t3_2afmvt,Ok I have a bit of back story for this one. I know that I am not the best at drawing I cant colour very well or use Photoshop but I know that I am ok at sketching so I gave it my all.Also was thinking what can I do to make my drawing unique? When it hit me I could draw Diancie and another Pokmon in a double battle which would be cool. So when I finished Diancie I was thinking what Pokmon should I draw? In the end after about half an hour of thinking I decided on a HP Grass RotomHeat as it has moves that would counter Diancies weaknesses and coincidentally its own. Enjoy Double Battle by uIndigo.,Pokemongiveaway,ciuur03,2,t5_2ub11

1504857,0,t1_cj4w06n,gtI think everything in life has a price even if it is labeled as free. To want it be simple and fair for an already simple and fair giveaway is a bit much. That is a beautiful clich have you considered a career in politics?gt I recently became moderator of another subreddit.Oh you have. AlsogtThis way not everyone is rushing at the same time.Uhm first  comments in the Diancie thread appeared in the first  minutes and that is only counting by the reddit counter which might be rounding up. If thats not rushing at the same time you wanted to prevent then Im not named Andrew.The thing is we are kinda a hivemind. We instinctively try to find an optimal solution. I have a sneaking suspicion and I honestly want to test it  for science  how every single person in the giveaway thread ended up there. My best guess is this every single one was either sitting on your profile or on the new subpage hitting F having a message in their clipboards so once you show up they can just hit CTRLV enter and then pray for their internet providers. There is no way to shorten that time and to eliminate other random variables or at least I cannot think of one. My point is that I do appreciate your noble behaviour but you are dealing with flood of people here. And your solution is not optimal because you still end up with the same problems. The only better one I can think right now would actually be using some rd party random number generator and I have seen this happening on this site but I cannot tell you how does it work in the end. ,Pokemongiveaway,cj4wnzc,1,t5_2ub11

If you think someone deserves this kind of post and titles such as untrustworthysomeone who has a history like rainbowgreybut one time couldnt finish a giveaway because of real life problems...you need to check yourselfbecause that is a very immature way of thinking. It is a video game. Be fucking happy and lucky that someone took so many hours of their life to neatly set up a tournament for people to enjoyand provided ANY sort of prize at all. Tough tittes that some people werent good enough to get higher ranked up and therfore didnt get a prizebut you guys look foolish for hating on this guy so much.

Ive been in at least  giveaways which I was promised a shiny Rayquaza and an Arceus and  shinies of my choice before they reneged and said nope never mind but that doesnt mean I make a witchhunting post about them. Just move on and silently REStag them as do not join if you feel particularly incensed at them.This is the kind of stuff you dont post but instead contact the mods if you feel so so so incredibly hurt by this. Just remember they never owed you anything in the first place and it was their own prerogative to make the giveaway so they kind of reserve the right to change rules if they want or close it if they would like. You dont know their complete situation. Just move on to the next one. Plus mods arent witchhunting posts against the rules? More specifically Rule ?,Pokemongiveaway,cjlfnml,3,t5_2ub11

1692090,0,t1_cjsg2dc,A mosquito isnt technically a parasite a parasite lives in or on a host and uses the nutrients from their body to grow and reproduce. Only female mosquitoes suck blood and they only do so for the protein required to have their babies which means that mosquitoes as a whole arent parasites because if that made them parasites then we would be considered parasites as well for drinking milk from animals its basically the same thing.,Pokemongiveaway,cjsg9sz,1,t5_2ub11

Or us old timers who have been with it from the very beginning. If you dont have a way to go play it because youre too young? Theres a show for you. If thats a little too young for you? Theres a manga. Want to be serious about it? Theres the TCG or competitive play. Anyone and everyone is welcome. ,Pokemongiveaway,clxx90e,0,t5_2ub11

My favorite part was the battle to get Mewtwo in cerulean cave. Longest battle ever!!! I think it took  tries and on the rd try it took  ultra balls and I still didnt get Mewtwo. So I threw out a poke ball it shook three times and of course he comes out!! So I throw my last one and I finally catch Mewtwo!!

2915337,0,t3_2ti3et,If anything this will just increase the volume of traffic trading will see albeit more hacked trades but still more trades and in the end will just be a booster for the community.Understand me when I say I dont endorse things like this because hacked pokemon ruin the depth for lack of a better term of the market for trading and ruin the fun for a lot of people who get their kicks out of having the coolest or the strongest or trading for the best pokemon out there. People enjoy the thrill of the hunt the length of the breed etc when they get rare pokemon.Then again I guess there are people who just enjoy having the pokemon too  and those people will GET their pokemon. Regardless of what most of us have to say about it so I say  the less damage they do overall for the market the better and this shouldnt be a huge damper on our fun so whatever I say.I wont let things like this ruin my enjoyment anymore  I agree with the sentiment being expressed across most every pokemon sub and that is Who cares? I will still have my fun with the game.  ,Pokemongiveaway,cnzhcdr,3,t5_2ub11

Tuttavia  un BELLISSIMO gioco e dovresti decisamente provarlo specie i primi tre. Ti sconsiglio abbastanza Ace Attorney Investigations e Dual Destinies.

But one with awesome Ivs. I would probably be traded a lot people would hate on me just because I only know a single move fighting other Pokemon would be a constant struggle.... But someday I would find a trainer with enough brains to check my IVs before trading me and he would probably adopt me and turn me into an awesome Gyarados.  Getting stronger would be hard but Itd be worth it. We would travel and compete together a lot Id love to have him win lots of contest. We would face everysingletrainer and beat the Elite  together. As a Pokemon having someone who  believes in me would be my most important goal I would no longer be ashamed of the fact that once I was a useless Magikarp cause said Magikarp helped his trainer to become a champion DThere.

3057212,0,t3_2v6dhe,Im actually new to this subreddit and the Breedject giveaways have been the best. Theyre not as limited as some of the clonedshiny giveaways and its easier for me to be around long enough for them. I understand that the clonedhacked shinies are super popular but the bred pokemon have helped me so much with my pokedex and just having good movesabilities. Im sorry that its been frustrating as of lately to get attention for your giveaways but there are people around who appreciate it. Anyway I hope things start looking up for you OP.

3112263,0,t3_2vseuh,My FC is in my flair my IGN is Zero and I would like a douse drive meloetta if I win please.  When I was a little boy I had a Rottweiler named Zeus who was basically my best friend in the whole world. I was maybe two or three years old I think and I remember how I would lay down to take a nap and this giant dog would curl up around me and put its paw over me growling at anyone who passed by like I was his own little puppy to protect. I was so small I even remember how I tried to climb on his back and ride him around like some majestic stallion but I was even too little to reach. We were pretty close I have to say but there was one winter unlike the others that we shared together. It was an especially cold day and all the roads were frozen in the early morning before any rock salt had been put down. Zeus got out. That morning he slipped on the ice cracked his spine and died. I was just a kid so it was hard to explain that I was never going to see my best friend ever again and that hurt. What I remember though the time we had that was what was important to me and thats why any reason to remember my friend makes me happy. Thanks for the giveaway. ,Pokemongiveaway,cokl2io,1,t5_2ub11

I will reply to your questions belowQ Are you interested in doing giveaways like this again? If so what about them makes them interesting or could be done to make them more entertaining.A Yes I am very interested in participating in such giveaways. These giveaways are different from others in that one must earn the right to get a rarelegendary pokemon and I believe in working for achieving goals. Every person competing in these type of giveaways puts hisher heart and thoughts on the process and its a great activity and feeling when one wins. Q Do you enjoy having more than one topic or would prefer to have a single topic only? A Diversity is key to keep things exciting and promote growth for any situation. Therefore I would like to write about different thingstopics if that was up to me. Note also I won a meloetta on another giveaway so i was hoping if i can get a keldeo instead. if not thats fine. i was just curious.thanks again for the opportunity!!!,Pokemongiveaway,consehk,1,t5_2ub11

Arceus Meloetta Mew Genesect cannot ever be GTSed There may be a few others. Shiny Arceus and Shiny Meloetta cannot even be FC traded. Nor can Shiny Xerneas Shiny Yvelta or Shiny Zygarde. They are shiny locked  they are not supposed to exist. Shiny Darkrai can most definitely make it through the GTS but only if he has his Ribbons removed. Ive also gotten a Keldeo nonshiny through the GTS. I believe Celebi Jirachi and Victini are also FC only regardless of Ribbons but Im not sure.The important thing with events is to make sure they are legitimate before even trying. Its generally best Ive found to borrow a real event clone it and edit it rather than creating one from scratch. ,Pokemongiveaway,couvl8n,1,t5_2ub11

3564314,0,t1_cpyjysk,What you need to do is make sure the item in the ball pouch of your bag is at the same number as the Pokemon you want. Not sure if this works on mons like MewMeloettaManaphyGenesectHoopaVolcanion but you can Wonder Card hack for some of those. Then once you set the number of items to the same number as the mon you want to be in Box  Slot  save your game and insert to PowerSaves. There should be a cheat file somewhere to alter the Pokemon in BS or add that Pokemon to BS. Im not exactly sure all the specifics because Ive never done it this way. I use the Wonder Egg cheat and hatch my own. The process is the same except you will need to be in a Poke Center so you can talk to the lady to receive your Mystery Gift which will be an egg containing the Pokemon whose number matches the number of items in slot one of the Ball pouch. This process does not work for Arceus Mew Meloetta Manaphy Genesect Hoopa Volcanion but does for all others I believe. You can alter IVs this way and there is even a way to put the egg in to BS and remove the Fateful Encounter tag on the Summary of the Pokemon. Hope this helps. ,Pokemongiveaway,cpyk3vw,2,t5_2ub11

3675087,0,t3_32fy01,Hi uUdinaassoletaken! I think its great you decided to hold a giveaway. Here are a few tips to get more attention for your giveaways.    . Give more information about your Pokemon. Most giveaways say the nature ability and egg moves of the Pokemon. Heres one of my older giveaways as an example.  . You can also use one of my formatting templates if you need help formatting your giveaway.  . Use the GTS method to give out these Pokemon because GTS is much easier than trading each individual person. The requestor deposits a trashy Pokemon like Taillow Wingull Surskit NOT Wurmple or Zigzagoon because of GTS glitches and requests one of the giveaway Pokemon. Then as the giveaway host you go on the GTS and look for the Pokemon they said they deposited and trade it.    Good luck for your future giveaways!,Pokemongiveaway,cqb6mt0,3,t5_2ub11

6247930,0,t1_cyzskfw,Thats a little complicated.Some are obviously illegal like Amaura in a moon ball.But others get more complicated. The Pidgey is in a level ball which is legal. But HA pokemon cant legally be in any apricorn ball so thats an illegal comboSome are even more complicated. Pumpkaboo for example is in a nest ball. You can catch HA ones in the friend safari in any ball usable in XY which includes nest ball. So HA Pumpkaboo in a nest ball is legal. But only medium size Pumpkaboo can be found in the friend safari and this one is XL size. So technically its an illegal combo too.Those are just some of the ones I know off the top of my head though its a pretty long list and I dont really feel like looking them all up since I dont care about legality of ball combos. And theres also the fact that a lot of these are males so they wont pass on the ball anyway and their offspring will be  legal.If it helps theyre all legally bred pokemon. None of them have been hacked. Just some of their parents were lol.,Pokemongiveaway,cyztlye,1,t5_2ub11

6915082,0,t1_d104b9q,This list is the most useful once you get used to reading it. For instance with Bulbasaur the apricorn balls are blank so theres no way to get Bulbasaur in those legally and for the Dream ball the hover text does not say breed female... in this ball so the event was males only and a female Dream ball Bulbasaur is an illegal combo.For general rule of thumb Any HA with an apricornsportsafari ball is illegal Any starter in an apricornsportsafari is illegal Any gen  or  Pokemon in an apricornsportsafari is illegal Any gen  Pokemon in a Dream ball is illegalThere are some gen  Pokemon that arent legal in Dream balls and some gen  or older Pokemon that arent available in HGSS and thus not legal in apricornsportsafari balls so you can check individual Pokemon as you get them but thats the basics.Generally what I do when Im not sure is go to bulbapedia and check the locations available in the different generations. If it doesnt say Safari Zone for gen  or  its not legal in a safari ball if it only says Safari Zone for HGSS its not legal in apricorns etc.Sorry for the longwinded reply hope that helps!

7679041,0,t1_d3f0js7,Sorry seems to have been sniped as for IV breeding youll need a few things. . Destiny Knot and Everstone a Destiny Knot will make it so  of the parents IVs transfer to the child instead of  an Everstone guarantees that the child will have the nature of whatever parent holds it for example if you wanted a Jolly Gallade youd have a Jolly Ditto hold the Everstone. . A breeding Ditto a IV Ditto can breed with anything that isnt in the Ditto or undiscovered egg group and is the best way of passing on IVs. These are almost always hacked and you can get one at rBreedingDittos . Patience this takes timeAfter youve got all three items go to the Battle Resort put the Ditto and whatever you want in the box and start hatching babies go to the IV checker in the Pokcenter and keep all that have  or more IVs then take the original Ralts out and put in one of the  IV Pokmon continue this until you get a IV Pokmon then repeat until you have a IV child with the genetics you want for example a Gallade would want x while a Gardevoir would want x,Pokemongiveaway,d3f27kj,1,t5_2ub11

7828681,0,t3_4mj22q,Blue stood daunting as the final hyper potion was put onto my Raichu and only my Raichu. This run of leaf green I held only a Raichu on my team the journey daunting but successful none the less. Pidgeot was sent out and as quickly as such a thunderbolt swiftly took it out. Rhydon next as Raichu went in swiftly for the brick break easily defeating its weakness and as such securing it an easy win. Then arcanine came out with an effortless speed struck the Raichu. Leaving it injured he was undaunted as Raichu dug under the ground. The turn passed as anticipation hit the air as blue and arcanine waited. Just as swiftly Raichu sprang from the ground and gave the arcanine a blow of which seemingly knocked it back into its poke ball. Trainer and Raichu alike felt synchronized and connected and as such they were ready for the impending alakazam. He sprang out and with an effortless gaze dropped emotions of fear and effort into my psyche. This was as such the Bane of my existence and I wouldnt let it be such. Raichu went through another cycle dig then attack. As such the alakazam went down gaining me a win or at least I thought. The final venasaur had often been known to beat many before but i had not the fear. A single dig took it out the Brutish beast lay defeated and so did Blue. A victory for Raichu and I solidifies in the hall of fame save files forever more trainer and Pokemon. Then seemingly forgotten the trainer forgot and left the victorious Raichu alone.  years later the lights turned on and he was in a new region. From kanto to kalos the Raichu stood grateful as he became ready to take on the daunting task of the kalos elite . Trust lasts through generations forever and unbreakable.,Pokemongiveaway,d3w0e2v,2,t5_2ub11

7997048,0,t1_d4ew305,Just a tip to giveaways remember to give Egg Moves before breeding for giveaways                  Pawniard needs EM Sucker Punch.          Beldum has no Egg Moves. You can consider HA because it is rare did one  months ago and is very successful.         Staryu has no Egg Moves. Rarely saw one request here.         Sneasel needs EM Icicle Crash and Fake Out.        Poliwag can consider EM Encore.                 I have done giveaways on all these pokemons excluding Staryu. Based on results Egg Moves makes a lot of difference. Among all of these pokemons HA Poliwag is the most highly requested here even higher requested than HA Starters. Did one HA Poliwag about a year ago. I have given out all  in less than  minutes. For HA Starters I have bred  HA Totodile  months ago and took me about  hours to give out .,Pokemongiveaway,d4ey0d1,1,t5_2ub11

8463588,0,t3_4vlegj,I am going to be Yoshida Kazumi this week again I should use Kazumi as my Pokemon Sun IGN after I received it.                     To anybody posting request threads please remember to close the threads when I reached home tonight some threads were left open it is very tedious to go to every request thread and ask Do you still need one?.                  And I also realised many people broke rule  because they requested for BP items or move tutor. I have spent  hours writing on         Battle Maison                   And guys remember that requesting for BRs are not allowed here you should not have the mindset that someone will hack or clone one for you there are people who gave pokemon that failed legality checker in PKHex.                And to dear donors dont ask for anything in return. Being a donor myself I realised many people posting request threads always attempt to give me something in return which I usually declined because I already have a ton of selfbred BRs so I think that there are many people here always asking for something in return when fulfilling request threads which defeats the purpose of this subreddit.                    And to people doing HackedCloned giveaways remember to use legality checker to check if it is legal unless the pokemon is not released for example Meloetta Genesect etc. A sample of pokemon which fail legality checker  Shiny Deoxys impossible                   Top requested pokemon last week         Ditto         HA Dratini          HA Tyrunt           HA Torchic          HA Snivy          HA Totodile           HA Poliwag          For those who want Ditto go rbreedingdittos. Do you guys need me to post the top requested pokemon here every week?                  Should I play Pokemon Moon in Chinese? If I play Pokemon Moon in Chinese all my future pokemon I give away will be in Chinese the IGN will be  Chinese version of Yoshida Kazumi. I can read both English and Chinese because I played gen  with fantranslated Chinese version. Dont worry I will still play Sun in English.                 For anybody who dont know who is Yoshida Kazumi she is another fictional character different fiction from Shakti. The difference between Kazumi and Shakti is preaching and things get worse Kazumi is repeating the same things again and again....                   I sincerely apologise for being as annoying as Yoshida Kazumi. ,Pokemongiveaway,d5zhgvp,3,t5_2ub11

8643072,0,t3_4eq6rp,Status OnlinesIts been a while since Ive done a giveaway so lets make this one special! This is going to be a totally original guessing game contest featuring facts about myself and pokemon. If you guess correctly you win a custom pokemon genned by yours truly!We will start with six  questions and six potential winners. Though if this goes quickly I may add a bonus round.Contest Rules Please answer questions in this format  Question   your guess Only one guess per post. You can only win once! If you make one correct guess you may not try for another win. After making one guess wait at least  minutes before posting again. I will know if you got impatient.  I will send the winners a link to a Google Form where they can fill out their pokemon requests. Only one per person! If people seem to be having trouble guessing I will start hinting at the answer. To make sure youve read the rules tell me your favorite pokemon in your replies. Otherwise youll be skipped regardless if your guess was correct. Custom Mon Guidelines Please fill out as much of the form as possible. This will help speed up the genning process. If you choose to give your pokemon a nickname use accurate spelling. I will put what I see even if its spelled wrong. I can gen most legendaries by cloning legit ones I already have. This includes Arceus! If Im unable to gen the pokemon you want I may ask you to pick a new one. Make sure the pokemon you want isnt shiny locked before you request a shiny!Anyway let the guessing game begin . Whats my favorite pokemon?. One of my least favorite pokemon?. What was the first shiny I ever caught ingame?. Of all the gym leaders which is my favorite?. My favorite evil team...?. My very first starter. aka which one I chose from my very first game,Pokemongiveaway,d6lzt04,1,t5_2ub11

8915107,0,t3_52dsmk,Dragonite is my favourite pokemon and has been for many years. I loved Dragonair at first purely because of its design but after playing through my first copy of gold and finally obtaining a Dratini from Claire I was extremely disappointed with Dragonairs lack of power. By then it was postth gym and I wanted to train Dragonair up to help me beat the Elite . Training it up was an absolute chore but completely worth it when I finally obtained my first Dragonite and completely demolished the Elite  and champion. Its been my absolute favourite ever since  no pokemon has come close to the love I have for this one.My number is  thanks for doing this!,Pokemongiveaway,d7jgraf,1,t5_2ub11

10064320,0,t3_5jvsqr,Hello uManbearpig. You dont need to and should not be offering a Pokemon for trade when making a request. This is to prevent people from demanding payment for fulfilling requests as we want to maintain the giveaway spirit of the subreddit. Please keep this in mind when making any request posts in the future and report any people who ask for any valuable Pokemon in exchange for the one theyre giving you.    You may tip your responders if you like but advertising Pokemon for trade or any rewards isnt allowed. Your post has been removed from view you may resubmit a new post with the suggested corrections.,Pokemongiveaway,dbjekn2,1,t5_2ub11
