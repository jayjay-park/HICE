11274923,0,t3_60wk3f,There are some other threads which lightly touch on this including one I started. Following my own research I would say that no LuLaRoe will likely not support or have the backs of consultants. It is a run of the mill MLM  Pyramid scheme. There are numerous cases of these having to shut down when fined or sued. I guess a slight positive if that happens is LuLaRoe may become cheaper to buy? Lower demand  lower prices in basic terms.I have some friends who are consultants but they have only very recently like within  days seen LLR for what its for  they did mention that LLR brought this issue up on a training call and that there is nothing to worry about. But they would say that though right? Or they wont buy anymore inventory. Eventually it seems like most MLMs run a course of sweeping popularity LLR  months ago decline and issues now? and then close. There is literally nothing stopping the owners firing everyone and closing... Consultants probably wont talk about it as they are not permitted to question or show concern about anything. They have to believe in the system. God Im so stupid to think i was going to sign up for this. As a buyer myself ex buyer I guess I would be concerned too. What are your thoughts?,lularoe,df9zves,9,t5_369dk
11346349,0,t3_61srau,So your issues seem to be a bit confusing what do you mean by selling  of what she buys? Is she really dumping an extra  into inventory every month? That seems a bit excessive especially since her customer base doesnt seem tobe that demanding. We have been doing it for  months now for the first  months we grew our inventory around  a month. After that its around  a month. Inventory is up to k now with an endgame goal of around  eventually. Maybe she is making incorrect purchasing decisions. One thing weve seen and been told is a big mistake is going wide instead of deep basically getting all the styles but only have a few  from each style rather than many options from fewer styles. Maybe thats the issue? As far as making money gross sales per month continually increasing each month as inventory grows is up to k from our launch month which was k. We made our initial startup costs back in .months. Mathematically we average around  margin on sales. We made .k profit last month. .k from gross will go to replace inventory we will toss  into new stock    set aside for taxes take home is around . For the first few months we busted our butts to grow a good online and in home pop up community working together at least full time hoursish. Now that we have a solid base she probably spends around  hrs a week on it. We do in homes on Saturdays and the occasional Thursday night and online sales sundaytuesday. It seems to me maybe your wife is getting bad business advice or possibly growing too quickly. These clothes have a  profit margin and if she has a nice customer base making money is inevitable. Having people under you is a nice bonus but only if you have alot and only if they are successful. Leaving people out to dry aka not making any money you give minimal returns. Look to people who are successful and find out what she is doing wrong. Ask her sponsor or even higher up and other team members utilize the training material and get advice on how to proceed. At  profit margin there are very few business opportunities with that much return so figure out whats going wrong and go from there. ,lularoe,dfi371l,4,t5_369dk
