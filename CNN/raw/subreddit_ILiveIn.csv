Some words and simple sentences are understandable really similar or same as in estonian but if you watch finnish tv its really hard to understand everything because of all the difficult words. I guess if you watch it enough you can learn it pretty quickly we have lots of finnish channels on cable and the language structure is similar.. Russian is taught at school and is compulsory. Some choose not to put any effort into it though and many think its stupid and unnecessary. I personally understand it well and speak it at a decent level  its even required by some employers to get a job with them. Older people tend to be more fluent in russian especially on the northern coast.. Im studying medicine rd year and live off grantsstipendiums at the moment. After th year Ill probably work as an apprentice nurse or something similar. . The estonians general stance is that it was an oppressive time forced upon us.

Emmigration is on the rise. Tourists are fine. They bring the life to a somewhat sleepy summer in Ljubljana. Immigrants come mostly from exYugoslav states and Albania and although there are some people who openly oppose it I think most of us dont mind. We havent had any ethnic tension between the locals and immigrants. There is however a Roma problem in some parts of Slovenia.  I really wouldnt know. Depends on the field.

But briefly in the cities we all speak almost standard french just a few different words and a slightly different way of constructing sentences we put a lot more y in them p we have also a little almost imperceptible accent of our mountains. But if you go deeper into the mountains it will be more and more audible especially among older generations. You can find a sweet exemple of this charming singing accent in this interview of Jean Roulet a bouilleur de cru a distiller in a small town in the mountains of Savoy   .

We live right by the New River Gorge Bridge and on top of gorgeous waterfalls theres a ton of raftingcanoeing adventure companies as wellI dont think Ive been to the wheeling area specifically but we drive to Columbus OH every year for Rock on the Range. Are there any touristy things around your area?

There is a WWera British bunker you will find in here a lot of WW British military infrastructure. near my house and there is a Byzantine church on top of a hill very close to the city.,ILiveIn,d2fo6ho,2,t5_2r4v8
7639636,0,t1_d3a6u9q,Ive never personally seen a Tornado myself. Ive had one get about  minutes from my house and thats about as close as it got. It seems south OKCE.G. Moore Norman seems to get more of the brunt than where i live.OKC will definitely beat the Golden State Warriors weve done it before well do it again.Ive lived in OKC for about  years im  now. But before that i grew up in Florida. Im a florida native so i grew up around the ocean. My impression of the ocean is thus The sand is hot as coal the ocean is too salty. prefer swimming in fresh water. But then again i didnt go to some of the better beaches with clear waters and baby powder sand just a regular old Florida beach.My favourite resturaunt in OKC is probably five guys the blaze pizza or the Garage. There are just so many great resturaunts here. If you want a more local experience twelve oaks in Edmond VastOKC in Devon Tower the dinner detective was fun too.My last vivid dream If i recall correctly i was in a shootout with some bad guys for some reason i dont recall. I dont have many vivid dreams or at least i dont remember them.the OKC bombing? yeah occassionally. the guy who taught me to drive was actually a maintenance guy back then. He was supposed to work on the side of the federal building that blew up he was supposed to wash all the windows. But he was late to show up because he had issues at the previous job he was working at that day. If hed been on time hed have been there when it blew up.Theres also a marathon here in OKC memoralizing the bombing and so we talk about that quite a bit. I mean its in the back of our minds but not a constant thought.Does OKC feel more liberal than the rest of Oklahoma? Yes absolutely. Ive never been to Tulsa sadly but OKC is definitely more liberal than the other parts of the state. It is where all the ethnic minorities are concentrated and we have more diverse set of peope here. Its still a very very conservative place dont get me wrong. But driving into a smaller Oklahoma town even just  minutes outside OKC is an entirely different atmosphere. You can feel it. I went into this one town not that long ago East of OKC. It was a small town and i dont even remember the name. I walked into the gas station there and they had restraunt like tables all around. I felt like i was walking into a saloon in a western because everyone turned to look at me. I was a foreigner to these folks. Theyve got a different way of talking and a whole different way of thinking. People in Oklahoma just assume you agree with them especially on conservative issues. People will ask what church you go to when you meet them ask what kind of guns you carry theyll talk shit on Obama and assume you agree. especially if youre white. Honestly if i was a minority a liberal or a agnosticatheist i would not feel comfortable in the smaller parts of Oklahoma. just because the people there are so conservative and Christian. but dont get me wrong theyre good people. Just dont expect to win any political arguments that range from the Left.and if youre a homosexual or alternative lifestyle type definitely avoid that subject unless you know the person is cool with it. ,ILiveIn,d3al1lr,2,t5_2r4v8

8302948,0,t1_d5ehz4o,I think the worst part of Tel Aviv is the humidity and weather in the summer. Its just too moist and hot. Its like walking in a bowl of soup.One thing that no other city is that every time you walk in Tel Aviv you meet at least one person you know if not more than that. Its a really small city in that way and everybody knows each other. ,ILiveIn,d5ffcp4,1,t5_2r4v8

8452402,0,t1_d5xqn5e,Driving along the west coast. Most probably come here and stick to large areas and fly between them. Driving however is a special thing it takes longer but there is a lot of scenery to see and im sort of biased towards a driving vacation so that probably plays into it.School started at  i think. My extended vocabulary though comes from games programs and moviesshows. I think not dubbing helps a lot to keep English fresh in peoples mind and to speak it properly. They start with english at  now but you find more and more stuff in Norwegian now so im curious how that will pan out considering vocabulary.The immigration policy i think is a big one atm. Some want it even stricter some think the current is already too strict. Its no longer a major issue as the number of refugees is much lower than it was.We are a tiny boring country so there arent that many issues. A previous one was arming of the police. We dont really argue over too many things and if we do not for long enough for me to remember it seems. Wish i could give a better answer than that hehe.,ILiveIn,d5y34d1,2,t5_2r4v8
