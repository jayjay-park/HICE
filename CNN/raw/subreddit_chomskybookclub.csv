Check out the catalogs of Haymarket Books and AK Press and maybe even Alternative Radio and we can try to read some of that stuff. AK Press has really good sociological books from the perspectives of activistsindigenous peopleoppressed people etc. I dont know what to tell you. I went to school in the West Coast of the US and it was pretty vacuous politically at least for me. Definitely in secondary school less so in university. I didnt really become active until after I graduated university. I wish I had gone to the East Coast to study. Im in Berlin at the moment and everyone here reads I see people reading on the train all the time and I can throw a stone and probably hit an anarchocommunist P Politically its good for now although I feel guilty for not being in the US and active in activism when its needed.,chomskybookclub,dgsk1p4,4,t5_3ex6a
