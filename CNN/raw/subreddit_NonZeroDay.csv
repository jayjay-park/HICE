1438158,0,t3_2al0qy,Havent been around here for a bit been focusing on my goals plus fitting in a vacation.    So first I published my fantasy novella eBook The Shadowheart Legend on Kindle last week. Been working on it for about two months writing rewriting or reorganizing most days including a big push last week. It is quite literally the longest thing I have ever written but it was a lot of fun. The Shadowheart Legend is free until July th for anyone who may be into epic fantasy shorts. Shameless plug as last time I was encouraged to do so. If people are bothered let me know and Ill remove it though.  My workouts and eating have suffered due to my focus on my writing goals. I only worked out once in the past week so I need to start paying more attention to that and I need to start cooking for myself instead of getting so much takeout and prepackaged stuff. So thats something I plan to focus on more this week. That said I have still managed to bring my waist size down so I must have been ok but I know I can do better if I workout more reliably.Going into this week Im aiming to workout more reliably apply for a promotion which I intend to earn over the next couple weeks and spread the word about my eBook to as many people as possible.,NonZeroDay,ciwjsqi,6,t5_2z1yj

That might be a long walk outside with my dog if Ive been a hermit for too long signing up for volunteer work running calling a friend to go out ha! I dont have many whatever gets me outside of my head. I do recommend seeing a therapist if your day to day life is being significantly hindered by your mental health. I went to see one several months ago and she helped me process some old trauma which helped my depression. I still get depressed but it is not as bad. I only wish I had gone sooner. ,NonZeroDay,csrnvgv,2,t5_2z1yj

6941005,0,t3_4aq9bo,See if there are any interest groups that meet up in your town on eveningsweekends like geology or film or a political group volunteering DnD art bird watching hiking etc.  Its a good way to meet people if thats what youre interested in .  I joined a few groups when we moved to a new town and although I didnt keep up with all of them in the end I made lots of new friends in the process. You dont always gel with an interest group even if you really like the hobby like Ive hardly ever found an art group I liked but I can just draw at home.  I help a friend with his film stuff on the side even though I didnt like the group but we still have a DnD night a night or two a month and I volunteer with database work for our local CAB.  ,NonZeroDay,d133bvs,1,t5_2z1yj

7950192,0,t1_d49ml43,I believe all coursera courses offer a free and a certificatepaid version. I do not think the content differs at all. The only thing you get when you  pay for the course I believe is a certificate you could theoretically reference on your resume. This class specifically is pretty nice. It goes over techniques and methodologies on how to learn and how humans learn. The course is not intimidating and I think anyone can take it regardless of your background.,NonZeroDay,d49odlv,4,t5_2z1yj

8264513,0,t1_d5agke4,How was your experience with quitting gaming? For me it was kinda shit. When I quit playing my days would feel significantlly more boring less fun and just a drag. I went cold turkey for a couple of months and simply found myself shifting into timewasting and procrastinating through differet activities Surfing web videos instead of playing. I think Ill find a way to enter escapsim through whatever medium. That is quitting gaming sounds amazing. It would give me back so much time... But then I heard people like Elon Musk who still managed to play Fallout  while conquering the world and that gave me the mental justification to continue playing.,NonZeroDay,d5ame04,1,t5_2z1yj

Im going to download habitica and give that a shot.  Makes sense that I should try to do something for each goal every day.  I might take out music because its not as important and add in meditation instead.  Ill wind up doing music somewhat anyways.  Ill give that  minute thing a shot.  I like what you said about writing stuff down do you do that when you wake up in the morning?
