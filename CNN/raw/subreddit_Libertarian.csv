14139,0,t3_1u999q,If you always feel empty inside no matter how much more and more and more you keep raking in... Youre not greedy. Youre psychologically disturbed. While you can alleviate one psychological compulsion by afflicting yourself with an even more severe psychological compulsion its an unhealthy way to go about your business. Thats the problem with the definitions and the argument in the linked article.The entire premise for the argument boils down to some very bad advice. What exactly is the purpose of that money? To get more of itself? What need is it supposed to fill? Why is enough never enough? If its never enough does it even serve a need? More likely the need is not being met. If the need was being met then eventually the person would have enough money for their ambitions or their wants provided the growth of assets and income kept growing at a sufficient rate to reach critical mass and fulfill itself within the persons lifetime. The true need lies elsewhere.How about as ending racism? There are some rather interesting examples thrown in there about hiring minorities in order to pay a lower wage for the same level of skill and productivity. Ill give this idea a bite. Lets say thats completely true as it appears to be in the limited scope presented. Lets say that money is speech as its considered in American politics and the hateful irrational bigots greed overrides their hatred of anyone different from them...At least in terms of employment. If we are to accept the argument we must accept that the entire purpose of hiring hated minorities is in order to exploit cheap labor for the express purpose of turning a greater profit. What is to keep that greedy person from using a portion of their increased profit to hold down the minorities theyve hired targeting oppressing and systematically enslaving that demographic in order to depress wages further? It would increase profits and protect earnings in the long term. It would even fulfill the mandate of irrational hatred in a way that person could accept as being rational.Perhaps the racism behind such a policy would be mitigated by targeting every group in turn in order to exploit them all. Play the different arbitrary groups against one another using the conflict confusion and desperation in order to obfuscate the true purpose of the entire affair. Making money by creating a race to the bottom. Why reward hard work when you can just throw someone away like garbage and pay someone else half as much to do the same job?

79578,0,t3_1v0bm5,There are a great deal of assumptions in this post I want to try and hit and hopefully this will help show the libertarian perspective better. You discuss some good things some good etc.  Just understand that what you are saying here is that you hold to a worldview set of morals etc that you believe needs to be forced onto people via cages jail and guns.   I dont imagine you think that is how the progressive ideals should be put forward.  And whether you disagree with someone or not they have the right to disagree with you your lifestyle and your person as long as they dont violate your life liberty or property. The above reason is probably why libertarians come off angry.  We often understand government as an oppressive force.  You are telling people that they ought to be under force guns and cages to follow a specific worldviewidea. you say good weve done which suggests somehow government had a role in the way culture has changed.   I would argue the opposite.  Philosophy and cultural trends have a natural flow and government is at the bottom of that stream.   Government doesnt change any law until it is usually a belief that is already strongly present in the culture thus making it an unneeded law by the time it becomes enacted anyways. As someone who actually works a job that involves hiring people on a regular basis I can promise you that antidiscrimination laws are a horrible horrible idea and you should never want to be considered a protectedclass.  Why?  Well no one HAS to hire you and most jobs can fire you for pretty much anything besides discrimination so the prejudiced hiring managers arent going to hire you to begin with.  BUT if you are a protected class you have instantly become a possible lawsuit or issue for potential employers.  An employer is going to be worried about hiring anyone who might bring or have the possibility of bringing litigation against his company.   The law accomplishes the exact opposite of what it hopes to achieve.   Employers now have LESS incentive to hire protected classes.    Concerning the mob mentality.  Most libertarians are going to argue that a mob is much less threatening than an entire government that has the power of the gun.  I think your statement is a huge oversimplification but that would require much more typing to dive into.  Libertarians dont desire to force ideas on anyone that is the exact opposite of what libertarianism is about.  In libertarianism anyone is allowed to voluntarily enter into any contract or belief they like there is no forcing and there is plenty of room for voluntary systems.  They just argue that current systems should not be forced on them or anyone else.I dont think you give enough credence to the idea of the people culture etc. and put too much emphasis that change has some how come from the elite in Washington.  I think this hits the major points and I hope it is helpful.  ,Libertarian,cenhlne,6,t5_2qh63

But it would not be inconceivable that in the absence of such a government project there would be a private sector equivalent. Even now the majority of the worlds communications satellite operators are private entities. If you can claim GPS wouldnt exist without the government then I can claim that it would. Neither claim can really be proved.gt One of the most free societies was medieval London. With no public firebrigade and no building standards both which require a central authority London frequently went up in smoke.gt Following a multitude of adhoc firefighting arrangements and the Great Fire of London various insurance companies established firefighting units to fight fires that occurred in buildings that their respective companies insured. As demands grew on the primitive firefighting units they began to cooperate with each other until on  January  the London Fire Engine Establishment was formed under the leadership of James Braidwood. With  firefighters and  fire stations the unit was still a private enterprise funded by the insurance companies and as such was responsible mainly for saving material goods from fire.Several large fires most notably at the Palace of Westminster in  and warehouses on Tooley Street in  spurred the insurance companies to lobby the British government to provide the brigade at public expense and management.The free market fixed it? Until of course the operators decided they could collude with the government so they wouldnt have to pay for the expenses.gt There was no sewerage system which meant that many ingenious ideas such as piping muck into your neighbours basements or just throwing in front of their house.This is nearly the same thing as the GPS. Would the sewage system not have been built without the government? Would the people have continued to wallow around in their own filth without the light of the state to save them from themselves? You have to consider that the city was governmentadministrated land. The people would not have been able to change anything anyway without going through the government. If the area were privately held and privatelyadministrated it wouldnt be unimaginable that the people who own it and live in it would band together anyway and hire someone to fix the mess. The government doesnt actually build roads sewage system and communications infrastructure anyway. They contract out private companies to do it for them. Even the moon landing was planned funded and operated by the state but built by Boeing North American Aviation and Grumman. So why wouldnt private citizens cut the middleman out and hire companies themselves? gt No central standards means no standards for electrical work likely leading to far more deaths and far less reliable technology.Source?

You assume that black people are equal in aptitude but unequal in opportunity.I pick explanation .

115731,0,t1_cerl232,gtWhy would you assume that he is implying this rather than simply what he has suggested? He is suggesting that the rich have gotten richer at a much faster rate than the poor. Take note of his use of the word growth. It would be absurd to describe getting poorer as growth. It is because the statement The rich are getting richer at a faster rate than everyone else Isnt talking about people rather it is talking about a statistical categorey in stead of real life flesh and blood human beings. If you watched that first video i posted he mentions i think first How there is a great degree of movement of individual people and households among these categories so that over time those who compose it change i.e those at the bottom dont typically stay there their entire lives nor do the rich stay rich. These statistics are misleading on the whole but especially so for the top . People with unsually high incomes dont have these on a sustained basis. They are talked about as thought they are an enduring class of citizens when in reality they are outlier on average gaining massive spikes in income from fluke occurances such as selling their house receiving an inheritance cashing in stock options typically for CEOs but also for people who have invested in certain types of retirement accounts. These income spikes are for only one annum usually. Furthermore it is wholly a different version of affairs being insinuated or otherwise promoted by Krugman and others who are likeminded. Inequality and class structure are to mended veiwed as somehow inherently at odds with the way things ought to be when in reality there is no example in history whatsoever where people have been equal economically speaking here. It is because there is far to much diversity of intereststalentsgeographyluckconscientiousness ambition culture etc  among people and even among groups for there to be equality.gtHow can both of these statements be true unless you are suggesting that the top quintile have households twice the size of those in the bottom quintile? Measuring households while certainly not perfect would seem to render your previous complaint twice as many people in the top quintile compared to the bottom quintile invalid.Im not sure if I already mentioned this here Im running around commenting on the same thing in a couple of threads so i apologize if i already have. Household incomes are complete baloney when used for the purposes of describing inequality. Household incomes vary between groups in size and over time. It is true that household income has decreased. It is also true that per capita per person income has INCREASED over the same time period. How can these two seemingly contradictary statements be true? it is because households vary drasticalaly and often enough to provide these seeming discrepencies. take for example that african american per capita gdp is HIGHER than that of hispanic americans yet hispanic americans have a HIGHER HOUSEHOLD income. It is for the simple fact that Hispanic americans have a larger number of household memebers on average than african americans. If you use the household stat you would INCORRECTLY assume that african americans are worse off on average than hispanics. It is NOT the case. Hence be dismissing krugman for using the household income stat he should know better than to use this as a supposedly important point. Hes clearly trying to mislead you. gtSuppose you have two societies where the size of the pie is the exact same same level of total income wealth debt growth potential etc. however the two societies have drastically different level of inequality. One society is relatively equal while the other society has extreme inequality. Which one of these societies would you want to live in without knowing your place or position in society?I would assume that virtually everyone would prefer to live in the society with relative equality. Doesnt this suggest that inequality matters and all other things being equal is very desirable? Nonono. That only makes sense if you assume all people should be equal in economic terms. If you assume as I do that there is an immense diversity of choices interests talents cultural influence inherent abilities among diverse people then it is only natural rather inherent for human beings to be unequal in an economic sense. If you ask me the society where there is perfect equality is morally bankrupt and is actively pursing an imposibility to make equal what cannot and never will be equal.  ,Libertarian,cerlxq7,2,t5_2qh63

181517,0,t1_ceyxtv0,gt the voluntary marriage contractThis is an incoherent use of the phrase marriage contract.A marriage contract is historically when one family agrees to have their daughter marry another familys son. When the contract was made official... they werent married. That happened later. It was the agreement to eventually marry.gt I should easily be able to form a contract with someone You can. Its just that you wont be married to this person. A marriage isnt a contract nor is any contract a marriage.Its like contract is the only tool in your little libertarian toolbox and every social problem looks like a contract nail.

181520,0,t1_cez1r1k,gtthat the targets deserve trials.Deserve is a loaded word and its irrelevant. We dont have trials because the accused deserve it but so that we can justify our own actions toward them. Thats just as true with those targeted in drone strikes as it is for someone arrested for planning a mass murder in the United States. Bombing campaigns in the war on terror using whatever technology make the U.S. look bad for the same reason that any punishment administered without trial makes the authorities look bad.gtWhat I dont agree with is that somehow drones strikes are illegal and a denial of due process.Illegal is a straw man. For example it doesnt appear anywhere in the article linked above this discussion. On the other hand drone strikes obviously deny due process even if they are properly for legal purposes within the context of a war. The question at hand is whether thats a good idea in the context of this ongoing war against terror. This is how I understand your viewpoint if you have a war against Germany you try to kill German leaders via bombing among other methods if you have a war against terrorism you try to kill terrorist leaders in drone strikes. Thats an understandable way of looking at things but if you think that its bad to have a war against a crime bombing people for planning to commit that crime is going to look like one of the worst aspects of fighting such a war. When you declare war against a crime so that you can kill people accused of that crime without having a trial you are circumventing due process for criminal proceedings. Is that illegal? Of course not this authority under presidential direction of the military is properly granted by congressional authorization of the program. Theres a big difference in international public perception between our present bombing campaigns and bombing the leaders of a specific narrowly defined organization against which weve declared war. If we kill German military leaders in a bombing during WWII no ones going to say they deserve a trial. The action for which were implicitly accusing them  waging war against the United States  is public knowledge and theyve admitted to it themselves. The same does not apply to terrorism. There are legitimate questions about the guilt of planning attempted mass murder I wont call it waging war for those killed in drone strikes. Correspondingly people do call for traditional criminal proceedings to replace this bombing campaign.This is not just typical wartime aggression against the enemy. We arent merely being blamed for collateral civilian deaths but for mistakenly killing even the people were targeting. Are the people weve targeted even our enemies? This is not a question during older wars for the reason outlined above. Avoiding such mistakes is the reason to have a trial against someone accused of a crime.,Libertarian,cez4179,1,t5_2qh63

But it is not just that it forces people to work in a Protestantworkethic sort of way but it forces people to work jobs that they may be overqualified for. It forced people to negotiate their livelihood from a position of desperation. It is a form of coercion.The real problem is the cost of healthcare.  Even if it was as cheap as it was  years ago it would not be anywhere near the crisis that it is today.  It should be cheap enough that even the poorest who are receiving welfare for medical care are able to have access to high quality healthcare.  That would eliminate the coercion factor that you are referring to.gtSome of the best financial advice I ever received was to have an Iquitfund. That is have enough savings to be able to walk away from any job so that your employer cant hold you over the barrel.  This is a luxury that not all can afford particularly early in their career.  This luxury was taken from me when I found out I had cancer at . It didnt matter how much money I had in savings I couldnt quit my job because I needed my healthcare in order to continue my treatment with my oncologist. As soon as I needed my job I lost any leverage I had to negotiate my worth to my employer they had me over the barrel and sadly I counted my blessings that I was fortunate enough to not have to declare bankruptcy.gtFinally you can say that people ought to be free to choose no healthcare. I said this too. I thought it was dumb to have to have healthcare benefits when I was young and healthy. Then I almost died. I changed my mind and I suspect you would too if you had to honestly confront your own morality. I would agree.

327846,0,t1_cfepcw7,gt HOAs unions insurance participants and business employees are bound up in contracts that are  ultimately  enforced through government violence. You cant legally leave your HOA without selling your house. You cant legally leave your union or disobey your boss simply by saying I dont volunteer to do this anymore and then walking off with unpaid dues or trade secrets. There are a string of repercussions  up to and including civil or even criminal liability  for disobeying. Such disputes are weighted to favor of one party by the force of a third party ie the government.gt In a broader sense the concept of real estate ownership is established by that militant third party as well. If you attempt to cross through a neighbors yard and he shoots at you and kills you the local police wont arrest the guy they acknowledge as the land owner if he pleads selfdefense. By contrast if you cross a neighbors yard he shoots at you and misses and you return fire and kill him the police WILL arrest you. The knowledge of this asymmetry is what discourages people even wellarmed people from passing through governmentallyrecognized private property without seeking permission from the land owner first.gt Again this isnt voluntary. Its the result of implied coercive threats.HOAs Unions etc... are ultimately bound up in contracts enforced by state violence because they have little other choicerecourse. This isnt an argument against the ability to create less coercivevoluntary governance its just an example of the state using its monopolistic control over violence. Plus its relatively rare for these disputes to actually be settled by the state although threats of going that far are common albeit empty. Most disputes within HOAs insurance participants employees etc... are handled inhouse or through arbitration which is then followed by the involved parties. gt Im familiar with Friedmans work. Hes someone naive on this count. Arbiters typically work because there is a fallback system that both parties recognize as less appealing than private arbitration. The catchall system prevents people from simply evading arbitration entirely by stubbornly refusing to respect a private system.If you were familiar youd remember that in the system he promotes there is a fallback system which is far less appealing than arbitration  violence. Its an extraordinarily costly option particularly in free markets where consumer can choose their arbitersenforcers. gt Once again both parties having representatives who have arbiters merely divorces the problem by a degree. If you dont like the arbiter your representative selects for you then are you not allowed to disassociate from the representative? If people feel compulsed to contract with a representative or abide by an arbitration system they dont like... well... that sounds exactly like what we have in the status quo nonvoluntary government system.gt Once again both parties having representatives who have arbiters merely divorces the problem by a degree.A degree of separation can make a big difference. Its the difference between contracting a persongroup to defend you legally and find an arbiter who is also under market forces or having to use some state appointed bureaucrat in a robe. gt If you dont like the arbiter your representative selects for you then are you not allowed to disassociate from the representative?If you dont like a good or service being rendered to you should you not be allowed to find another provider of that goodservice?  gt  If people feel compulsed to contract with a representative or abide by an arbitration system they dont like... well... that sounds exactly like what we have in the status quo nonvoluntary government system.Of course in regards to writings on polycentric legal systems this is generally addressed as something which youd have outlined in your contract before signing up for service. gt True. But its the simple disputes that cause the most trouble. Consider two adjacent land owners cant decide on the property line both of whom have what they believe to be compelling evidence that they are right. Which land owner will support the ruling of an arbiter that decides against him? Suppose theres a dispute over a theft or a debt owed or a child custody dispute. If each party is convinced she is right the selection of arbiter becomes a proxy for selecting the outcome of the dispute.Consider two adjacent landowners parents lovers business partners whatever have a dispute. They both have compelling evidence. They either agree upon an arbiter or most likely their representatives do or rely on violence. Its almost certain their representatives wont allow violence since like I said before its extraordinarily expensive and something theyd probably want to avoid. gt If each party is convinced she is right the selection of arbiter becomes a proxy for selecting the outcome of the dispute.This is how arbitration works. gt Since the goal is to minimize violence to exacerbate it we havent seemed to advance the ball anywhere.  If the only purpose of an arbiter is to justify violence then lets skip to the chase and settle everything with pistols at twenty paces.If thats the case I think a market system where people choose their representationgovernance is far better than a monopolistic system which centralizes violence then passes it off as OK and legal because these people in magical costumes perpetrate it. gt Were just throwing up a bunch of legalese as a smoke screen to justify violence later on.Sounds like the current monopolistic legal system. gt If the only purpose of an arbiter is to justify violence then lets skip to the chase and settle everything with pistols at twenty paces.Actually the purpose of an arbiter is to settle disputes.

An ISP cannot throttle your speed on Tor because they cant tell what you are doing Unless they throttle or block Tor itself. The Bitcoin protocol can be used and currently is to manage decentralised internet in different ways. See Ethereum and Namecoin for different kinds of examples.ISPs care about politics quite a bit. This is why they recently spent millions of dollars and years in a court battle to defeat the net neutrality rules imposed by the FCC.FWIW I agree with the concerns about this being enforced through regulation which is why most development in this area focusses on trustless and decentralised methods to acheive net neutrality.,Libertarian,cfh2q2i,2,t5_2qh63

And even when you factor in their deductibles they probably waste that much money on gas movies internet and fast food. Oh but fuck me. Im one of those wealthy people. I made a whopping k dollars this year the most I have ever made in my life at age . And you know how much I spent out of pocket on health care costs?  dollars. And despite that I was still able to afford to save  dollars a month on top of over k dollars in bills a month. How did I dod that? Budgeting! I did the same damn thing when I was making k dollars a year. What the hell was I thinking? Why didnt have get some girl pregnant then I could raise a kid I couldnt afford. And you know what I understand that shit happens and people end suffering.

Human rights are thus conceived as universal applicable everywhere and egalitarian the same for everyone. The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law global and regional institutions in the policies of states and in the activities of nongovernmental organizations and has become a cornerstone of public policy around the world. The idea of human rights  suggests that if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language it is that of human rights. The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable skepticism and debates about the content nature and justifications of human rights to this day.

Im not denying that a projectile passenger is possible...  Im questioning whether the risk is so high that we need legislation that punishes those that dont strap themselves down because the possibility exists that they might maybe  chance hurt someone else.  Clearly  is a made up number... but Ive seen no other statistic that suggests how likely it really is.  And thats the point Im trying to make.  Im also not questioning the efficacy of seat belts or the efficacy of laws demanding seat belts be worn.gt Please show me the amount of monetary damage caused from projectile books in car accidents.  At least I can show you how much many deaths likely could have been saved if the passengers have worn safety belts.So I think you misread some of the links you provided.  One said how much monetary damage was caused be people not wearing seat belts.  Another said how much more likely someone in a front seat would be fatally injured if a person in the backseat was not wearing a seat belt.  None of them said how much money was lost due to unbuckled passengers hitting others while being a projectile.  You know why none of them said that?  Because theres no evidence describing how oftenlikely that event occursis.  So lets take a step back.  Breathe.  Pretend youre speaking to another human being.You made a claim in support of seat belt laws claiming that seat belts prevent passengers from becoming projectiles and injuring others in the same car.  I asked for evidence describing how often that event happens.  My intent for that request was to determine whether the event was statistically likely enough to warrant preventative legislation.  Arguably if a dangerous event is extremely unlikely to happen we need not legislate against it.  Statistics will keep it from happening for us.  You seem to understand that thought process as you asked for similar evidence regarding my quip about projectile books.  We both seem to agree that unlikely events or at least events that have little enough damage attributed to them need not be legislated against.From there I believe you misconstrued my request as one or more of the following an attack on the validity of your original claim an attack on scienceNewton an attack on the need for seat belts at all an attack on the efficacy of seat belts an attack on the efficacy of seat belt laws.  So let me restate a few things.  I dont doubt that people can become projectiles in an accident if not properly restrained.  I dont doubt the laws of motion.  I dont doubt that seat belts increase the likelihood of surviving a car accident.  I dont doubt that seat belt laws are effective at getting people to wear seat belts.Now that you have a better understanding of the intent behind my original request for information are you willing to entertain the idea that if evidence describing how likelydamaging projectile passengers are does not exist it might stand to reason that giving that claim as a support for the law isnt wise?  Wouldnt it be wiser to stick with claims that are supported with evidence?gt See? Libertarians arent too bright.

584747,0,t3_20tuw4,Why is a disparate impact always blamed on racismbigotry? Im not completely dismissing the point of the article Im just stating that there are many other things to consider here. For example police especially in big cities obviously are going to be concentrated in highcrime areas. Sensible? I think so. Its no secret that these areas are a lot of times the poorest of the poor and most violent amongst black neighborhoods. So naturally although the rate of usage is no higher here it would be logical that youd end up with more black mainly men getting into trouble for this type of thing due to the increased police presence in these areas due to high rates of violent crime. Now is that racism? I guess you could claim so but youd also have to believe that the entire war on drugs was conjured up specifically to target black men. Thats quite a stretch IMO. I think if little white Johnny and Susie out in the burbs were shooting each other over weed as regularly as young men in the hood are youd see the same kind of arrest numbers for weed there as you do in violent black neighborhoods IMO.There are plenty of reasons to decriminalizelegalize weed andor all drugs. But using this as one of them seems to be intellectually dishonest. Ive never cared for this argument. EDIT It would be interesting to compare the arrest rate amongst blackwhite not overall as this article has done but amongst blacks that are residents in mostlyoverwhelmingly white neighborhoods. Ill bet those numbers would be much much closer to the same. That alone blows the idea that weed arrests are racist out of the water. Just a thought.... ,Libertarian,cg6qndi,1,t5_2qh63

Im a European Im Swedish I live in a socialistic country where we have rather restrictive gun laws There is still a lot guns in our country not as high as the US or our neighbour Finland but still. We do not have the death penalty as a punishment we have very few citizens that get shot by policemen roughly  per year and  million inhabitants in our country. We do have however have a somewhat similar mediasystem with sensationalistic news reports and decision making on what to report on but not in the extreme fashion as the US but we are getting there. We also have very few people who arent socialists in one way or another they might not consider themselves to be just that but most are... and almost all support statism who find it justified to impose their views on others. The media is in leftwing oriented even if the owners of a lot of it could be considered to be somewhat more oriented to the right... we also have government controlled leftwing media.Its a country with a very strong hivemind groupthink if youd like... You are not supposed to be different you are not supposed to stand out you are not supposed to be special. And this is something that is imprinted in every citizen and how people are raised in this darn country...Could I really justify killing the most of these people just for my views even if they justify using their monopoly of violence to force me to pay and contribute wherever I want it or not? No not really. Could I justify killing a few in an ancap society to protect myself family and property? Yes I do believe so. Could I justify letting a lot of people die because I dont do anything to help them in one way or another? Probably. Do I believe killing something is something very final and should be used restrictedly? Definitely there simply is no coming back once you are dead nothing afterwards no fancy religious thing or whatever... Its final. Violence is such a dirty and primal thing it really should be used restrictedly and with thought really it would be best if people didnt use it at all... But then again I also consider a lot of people to be somewhat stupid so I guess I can understand why.But back to your proposal and post. Do I understand that it could be considered selfdefence to defend your property? Yes definitely. Could I personally justify a genocide as selfdefence? No not in any way. Could there be any issue with my views? Well...

762135,0,t1_cgqswvi,Sometimes environmental sensitivity is justified. Dont take this as a political ideology its just a statement of facts.If the word ecology is throwing anyone off here just replace it with economy its kind of the same thing and a bit more friendly to the Libertarian ideology. Ecology is the Free Market Economic System of Nature. Including us humans Thus if you are inclined to agree that if a healthy economy is valuable you should also agree that a healthy ecology is valuable.Desert ecology is extremely fragile. It might just look like a wasteland but there is actually quite a bit of life there which is codependent for a healthy ecosystem.Consider that most of the soil isnt actually soil its clay. Almost any overuse will turn what little fertile land there is into brick. Also most plant species take much longer to mature and most animal species are adapted to eat specific plants. Rabbits dont care if a plant takes years to grow. They will eat and breed and eat and bread and eat and bread. Normally the ecology can sustain this but overuse by ranchers tips a scale which is already on the tipping point.So we have overuse gt Bad soil gt Disruption of slow growing plants gt Disruption of animals which need those plants gt Unsustainable use for apex species.Why are we concerned about apex species? Because the tend to take more from the ecology than they give back. They usually dont have many if any predators. These are animals like Coyotes Cougars Humans even turtles. They are great for balancing the ecology when it is healthy but when it is weak they cause a great deal more damage.Apex species also tend to be long lived and dont breed as fast as prey species. So eventually the weakened ecosystem combined with over predication will cause a loss in the food chain making apex species starve. For instance Hawks keep the rabbit population in check but when the food chain collapses and rabbits die off the hawks die off too. Consider the rabbit population rebounds more quickly than the hawk population and you now have a large amount of rabbits and few hawks to keep them in check. Thus the rabbit population is unchecked to further decimate an already fragile plant system. The ecology becomes unbalanced and it takes decades to recover.So while the turtle issue isnt really related to the Bundy issue it kind of is. The weak ecology cant sustain a full turtle population. Turtles have a large range and live a long time. Being an apex species there is nothing to keep their population in check. Even if the Feds did release the entire population they would still die because their support from a strong ecology is not available. Its kind of like saying Lets release  hawks into an ecology with  rabbits Thats not going to be practical if each hawk needs  rabbits to survive. Same with the turtles.But most people dont understand this because they look at the desert and just see a wasteland. Its hard to understand the damage which has been done because the opinion is How can a wasteland be damaged?TLDR The ecological value of the land has already been destroyed by the ranchers long ago. We just dont understand it because the area always looked like a wasteland to us.,Libertarian,cgqwss4,2,t5_2qh63

Ill give you a head start Maybe you have a game you can set up thatll put you back on track?Are you saying you meant each of these statements literally and politely and not with an intention of sarcasm? Admittedly my name is not Huckleberry but nor is that an insulting name... so maybe you are a polite person who just has peculiar patterns of communication that come off as biting?Sarcasm is a sharp bitter or cutting expression or remark a bitter gibe or taunt.

Im not sure that you will care and Im not expecting an apology or change of personality or anything Im just wondering how selfaware you are about how you come across online. Look at the other posts in this topic even ones where people are disagreeing and see how different the tone is. Look at other posts that Ive made and see how different my tone is when Im not dealing with someone like you.gt i called its complicated handwaving you said it was nuanced political discourseNo you are calling nuanced political discourse handwaving and strawmanning it as its complicated. That is Im not saying handwaving is nuanced political discourse Im saying arguments for state intervention and legal systems are in fact complicated and are in fact nuanced political discourse and you are handwaving them away as handwaving in your meticulously constructed straw man.You further stereotyped when statists wave away reasoning with its complicated what that really means is I dont know and implied that if someone doesnt have absolute knowledge about a topic then their opinion is just as invalid as anyone else whether they have  knowledge or  but that is yet another side topic. Id wager most statists that say Its complicated to you believe you are just too ignorant or biased toward anarchy or grumpy to be worth their time to try to explain things to. That is it may be that they dont know any more details as you press them or it may be that your abrasive attitude assuming you speak every where like you do here and Im starting to see patterns looking at posts you have made elsewhere causes them to feel it is not worth their time and sanity to interact with you.gt then i replied with its complicated on a different matter and you said my usage was handwaving.Right. You implied that anyone arguing for something that is not a complete anarchy must eventually handwave in their argument ignoring the millennia of legitimate arguments for having a state to maintain law and order or protect from other invading states or to prevent a tyranny from forming inside the power vacuum would eventually handwave with Its complicated. Which is a straw man unless any position that cant answer infinite questions with a finite mind and must eventually give up because they need to work sleep and eat is doomed to handwave. Then you went on ahead and prematurely handwaved in your second post to illustrate how annoying it is when people handwave when no one else was hand waving except your straw man.Let me ask you this real quick Can you lay out a political stance that does not eventually contain an admittance to a limitation of knowledge  or what you call handwaving and seeing as its complicated could be seen as an admittance of intellectual limitation Im not  convinced that is always handwaving  or the action of displaying the appearance of doing something when actually doing little or nothing wikipedia again. Care to tell me what saying Its complicated dishonestly appears to accomplish??Let me ask you this again Is all handwaving equally bad? Is handwaving the first time a question is asked of you like you did as bad as eventually having to handwave when someone probes your political view for hours and you need to go piss?Keep in mind that this whole god damned backandforth arose from a straw man fiction you just had to post instead of asking a question and letting the OP actually answer it to see if you were right.gtyou followed it up with Everything is simple and can be explained in a few sentences online which i in no way ever so much as implied.You absolutely implied it. You set up a catchall labyrinth in your original post such that anyone who isnt willing to argue indefinitely about a complicated topic is demonized as handwaving. If you are aware that some topics are too complicated to conveniently go into by the way the Its complicated prediction you put forth is an inevitability after who knows how long arguing In the end youll tell me that its really complicated not the first thing the statist says even in your imagined scenario then why demonize such an inevitability?

Its really that simple.The problem is environmentalists are trying to get all crony with the BLM and force the costs of the tortoise onto Bundy legislatively.This is a perfect example of cronyism. Bundy gets a market the environmentalists get to end run around it and pull favors with what should be a neutral arbiter. Thus he pays everything and they pay zilch.If this land were managed by a private entity theyd be out of business because the bosss dipshit son said I like turtles and convinced his father to ban  of the paying customers off the property to make him happy.So the board didnt maximize the value of the land.

Ohio  U.S.   in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that police may briefly detain a person whom they reasonably suspect is involved in criminal activity the Court also held that police may do a limited search of the suspects outer garments for weapons if they have a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the person detained may be armed and dangerous. When a search for weapons is authorized the procedure is known as a stop and frisk.gt To have reasonable suspicion that would justify a stop police must be able to point to specific and articulable facts that would indicate to a reasonable person that a crime has been is being or is about to be committed. Reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances and can result from a combination of facts each of which is by itself innocuous.gt The search of the suspects outer garments also known as a patdown must be limited to what is necessary to discover weapons however pursuant to the plain feel doctrine police may seize contraband discovered in the course of a frisk but only if the contrabands identity is immediately apparent.,Libertarian,cgx3svh,7,t5_2qh63

This is an unnecessary conclusion.A government a central planning agency is made up of human beings just like you and I. There is nothing fundamentally special or omnipotent about it. And there is no reason why it should have a monopoly on charity or health care. In fact there are forces in a truly free market that would make charity and public services both of a higher quality and efficiency.For example instead of heavy taxation and forced payment into a social program  while the state heavily restricts alternate social programs creating a statecorporate monopoly  why not allow individuals to pay into private plans. And those industries from any profits they make will be able to contribute to those who cannot afford card. Further the families that save on taxation will have more resources to provide for their own local groups. And without artificial scarcity such as the patent regulations that make certain medications insanely expensive such as HAART drugs for HIV care can be extended to individuals at a fair cost who otherwise would be unable to afford it.Most people are quick to reject corporate monopolies  we realize that these are almost always harmful.

906638,0,t1_ch75hg4,yeah its not just water vapor. the liquid itself in its purest form is just three parts nicotine glycerin and flavoring. now when the glycerin is heated it produces a vapor that has nicotine suspended in it. this is the same way a fog machine works now the nicotine is readily and quickly absorbed by the lungs and the mucus membranes in the mouth. so yes what comes out probably does have a little bit of nicotine in it.However the nicotine in a vape and the nicotine in a cigarette are actually quite different. Nicotine in itself isnt to terribly addicting its on the same level as caffeine but when it is combined with the chemical that are in in cigarettes is where it gets its insane risk for addiction. As a former smoker my vape is allowing me to satisfy the cravings i used to have from cigarettes while not continuing to feed my addiction. In doing so i have been able to taper off from the nicotine and quit completely. While i cant say with  percent conviction that vapes are safe i can say that i made my own liquid so i knew what exactly is going into it.

910955,0,t1_ch7s76v,First off all pump the breaks I never said any of what you mentioned in your first paragraph.Now Im not one to assume a great deal but I would say that the majority of people who care about this issue are in three groups. People  and under.. People  and under who have gotten into trouble themselves.. People  and under who have had someone close to them get into trouble.I myself at one point was in category . I have had friends go to jail I have had friends assault officers I have had friends get DUIs and lose their licenses. I have never literally never had anyone of those friends be denied a job opportunity except those that went to jail or had an assault on a police officer charge and even then he was able to get construction jobs and now runs his own business. Now I explicitly mention those scenarios for two reasons. The first they were under  when they did those things. Second they did those things several times which is why a few went to jail. These are personal choices that they made which were mistakes that they didnt learn from and made them repeatedly. It wasnt a youre drunk and underage lets besmirch your record for the rest of your living life scenario. That is a made up bullshit story from what I have personally experienced. The friend I mentioned who went to jail was put in lock up  times for DUI before he had his license revoked. Then he drove anyway and got sent to jail. There were plenty of opportunities to correct the action and it didnt happen. Why? He was young and stupid his words not mine. I look at this issue this way. Most  year olds I know dont own their own house. Correct? Lets say that this is true. I also dont know of many bars that allow  year olds to drink. I dont think this would really change a whole lot either even if a age limit was revoked. People dont want to be around high school kids period. So what does this mean? It means that where people  and under drink are going to be at other peoples homes i.e. house parties and properties. The vast majority of the attendees do not stay overnight. So where do they go? The road. If this happens they are just as susceptible to police action as anyone of any age and they are just as dangerous as anyone of any age although I would say more soagain based on my personal experiences. To your last statement you might be at home watching a movie drinking in which case if you dont leave fine. But the likelihood of the cops getting called on you for doing that is null in that scenario. So do I care about this issue? No. Not really. It doesnt impact me directly any longer and I think there are far bigger issues to be concerned about. Kids are offered a shit load of leniency to fix their mistakes in my experience and I guarantee you that the ones that do will be fine.

But when you acquire a copyrighted work that was produced through a real investment in time and money and labor and pay nothing for it you are stealing just as much as if you stole a tangible good.

982361,0,t3_25cw4j,Im an anarchist. I dont have time to watch this right this second but Im commenting for two reasons. One I want to see what has to be said by this guy later and want the link and two to point out a quick thing or two about other anarchists especially anarchocapitalists that are quick to default to the NAP for solutions to their problemsAll logical arguments beg the question. The most basic argument modus ponens by itself cannot be understood in a vacuum. There is no way to justify using this logical device without first assuming it so to defend it i.e modus ponens is a valid argument therefore xxx other argument is valid. This means that when you put forward any wholly rational proposition in some sense the point is moot. Your attempt at avoiding fallacies by being rigorous has a foundational flaw and one that is likely to be larger that whatever problems that were being dodged rationally as there is no bigger philosophical crime than begging the question. This argumentation is not exactly new and dates all the way back to a few radical skeptics of the ancient Greeks. Im thinking of Pyronnius and Sextus Empiricus in particular.When we apply this kind of extreme skepticism to ethics we end up with an awkward situation. On one hand there is powerful ethical intuition. On the other hand there is no way to rationally justify it. By the very nature of a first principle it is either so and thus has no justification making it not so or has some further principle under it but then it is no longer a first principle. We apply this same reasoning to the new first principle. There is a clear problem here.The anarchist who begins with the NAP and tries to conclude all of the usual anarchists arguments regarding the State rights biopolitics and even ethics has to answer this one very important question about the bare ideas of the NAP Why? This manifests itself in other forms in different circles. You frequently hear things like morality is just subjective yadda yadda although the notion of a subjective morality is just patently false once you admit that a morality exists since there is there no way to explain it using arguments quite similar to the above. The problem is deeper than whether or not there is objective or subjective morality. The problem is that there is no way to argue successfully for any morality at all since subjectivism is crippled by the lack of ability to understand it as a whole and objectivism faces large logical gaps. Granting basic assumptions about ethical intuitions are either selfdefeating in the form of subjective applications that say nothing about what ethical intuition actually is or utterly useless when tried to be prescribed by and large to everyone.In my mind the only sense anarchism can make is from the other standpoint. The economic perspective of which thousands of pages of literature exist to demonstrate that if it can be assumed that humans act in the way that they perceive to be to their benefit with actions purely for pleasure or preference being defined as an individual benefit then we can demonstrate that free markets work successfully and work best. There are mathematical arguments for this with deep calculus topology and even from the theory of chaotic systems. There are rational arguments like those of Von Mises or Hayek and the like. There are historical arguments like those put forth by Rothbard. Im sure there are a hundred more authors out there that I havent read yet but the point is that there are a plentitude of ways to argue for anarchism that are coherent under basic assumptions  morality isnt one of them.,Libertarian,chfyaul,3,t5_2qh63

Thats not really an interesting observation however.  The problem in a recession is that you have too few dollars chasing too many goods.  This causes prices to fall and corresponding production rates to fall as well.Since production declines are bad and currency is relatively cheap and easy to increase the production of its better to increase the supply of currency to chase the abundant supply of goods than it is to cut production of goods and services until they match the supply of currency.Production decline is generally considered bad for the economy overall.gt Yeah it represents future production.It represents past production converted to fungible debt.  Most people get paid after they perform a job or deliver a good.  When there is a cash shortage it inhibits the ability of two individuals to exchange their services over time.  No cash means I cant get paid for my labor and I cant pay someone else in turn.gt More like tell farmer Joe that he isnt going to get the money he wants for his cornIf the percent yield increases faster than the perunit cost declines farmer Joe still comes out ahead.gt We would quickly find out how this would end in disaster if you multiplied this foolish decision and did it with millions more farmers.A corn surplus is good.  Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.  In that line we create a price floor for food to encourage production even when prices decline.

Youre making all this much more complicated than it needs to be.gt The point is monopolies can set prices. This disappears when there is more than one firm in the market.gtyoure committing a logical fallacy wherein you presuppose the conclusion to make the argument. I dispute your assertion that its possible in a truly free market place for no other firm could enter because of constraints. Von Mises is pointing out that these socalled natural monopolies are in reality governmentsponsored monopolies that only monopolize in virtue of the government creating a preferential environment.Its a thought experiment but clearly you didnt grasp that. The point was a monopoly can set prices if they are the only player in a market hence my consider a monopoly in which nobody else can enter so you didnt say well someone else would just enter. This is incredibly basic economics. The fact that someone can undercut that monopoly is what leads other entrants into the market.gtAgain this is not in a situation where there is a free market. This is in an empirical observation of a REGULATED market not a free market. Show me a SINGLE example of a free market natural monopoly and Ill show you how youre mistaken. There are none.

They are both dependent upon a largely rational voterconsumer when such a thing is most a myth on a large scale.Rare individuals at times might be able to fit that description but theyre not enough of a factor to defend either concept.gtIn voting it is winner take all. In the free market there is room for businesses to cater to the minority so that all voices are heard.It makes a difference when the majority are hurting the rest of the planet for future generations as well as hurting billions of people along the way to lifting millions of people out of poverty which is grossly inaccurate a shred of truth but little more than a shred. You see youre operating under this idea that reputation has a stronger influence than it really does. While it is definitely a factor it is a minor one when compared to costquality. Most people when asked if they support or oppose sweatshop labor will quickly oppose and yet those same people will not think twice about buying products made via sweatshop labor. While still the minority that have no problem with sweatshop labor have never actually been to a sweatshop or anywhere near one. You see...

Feel free to ask follow up questions Q Can Labor Certificates solve the ECP?gtA Marx offers the same basic idea in a series of essays entitled Critique of the Gotha Programme. In short he speculates that Labor Certificates can be issued to account for distribution of goodsservices on the basis of work contributed.gtSince Marx many Socialists inside and outside the Marxist tradition have debated exactly how to utilize such a method of accountcalculation that would work to advance socialism and communism. Marx himself saw this method as historically distinct to Socialism as it directly emerges from the transition away from Capitalism gtMises criticism of this method of accounting is to say that theres no rational basis in utilizing Labor Time as a method of account because he sees LT as a subjective value. That is to say choosing LT over anything else is entirely arbitrary and no method of Price signals or alternative method of distribution can account for Price Signals. If I need to get into this more I will but for now Im just glossing over thatgtSince then many have drawn up various alternative methods of calculation including but not limited to Parecon Market Socialism various computer modelling techniques each designed to handle economic calculation in one way or another. gtA very popular modern version of this is Cockshott and Cottrells book Towards a New Socialism which utilizes the computer modeling method to show how rational accounting can be performed within a planned economy. It shouldnt be taken as the final word on the issue but their methodmodel seems very promising. You can also read criticisms from the Austrian school and responses by Cockshott within the academic literature. gtIt should be noted that the ECP when taken at its most damning interpretation is merely saying that Socialism wont be as efficient as Capitalism under Marginalist measures of efficiency not that Socialism is materially impossible or necessarily unsustainable. Q Can a Planned Economy utilize competition in any way? gtAnother user says no a planned economy can not utilize competitive marketsgtThis is correct but it should be noted that some popular models for a planned economy such as Cockshott and Cottrells model in Towards a New Socialism maintain certain features which operate similarly to what can be called a competitive market. There are important differences between capitalists markets and their model for the distribution of consumer goods but the similarities have led some of the more serious members of the Mises crew to accuse CampCs model of using a pseudomarket to get around the ECP. gtEither way the approach is interesting.

1154376,0,t1_chzefue,I agree with you the rise is in taxes is due to a rise in the estimated value of the home. The argument comes in at what the value of the home is. Here its the county tax assessor who decides that. Not sure how they do it out there. The issue is that the annual reevaluation is decided by the tax assessor the government decides the value not the market. Your house is worth what the assessor says its worth. You have to appeal the assessment not an easy task to prove market value. Need to raise revenue? Everybodys property is now worth more. Boom a tax increase. Then every taxing entity has a handy tax increase to play with. Thats the same complaint every homeowner in Texas has. Austins problem is compounded by the fact that they spend freely to make the city attractive and a nice place to live but they dont want to raise local sales taxes to pay for it. There are some bonds we can vote for that get added to property taxes but most county and cities will raise discretionary spending say water improvements a high school stadium etc. through sales taxes. Our state constitution limits how much they can play with sales taxes most referendums are for fractions of pennies in increases.  I should say I live in small town Texas but Im close enough to Dallas that Im familiar with their political shenanigans. I still prefer it to a state income tax. I feel for you guys out there as high as your property taxes are you get hit by the state on your income also. Thats got to hurt.   I agree with you on the problems of using property as a way of taxation especially when its the tax man who decides what the property is worth. I prefer a consumption tax would settle for a flat tax. I accept that some taxation is needed paying for what you use seems to be the fairest way to me. A flat tax can be manipulated by accountants and lawyers much like the income tax. For example we need to raise money to repair roads and bridges. We are asked to add a  cent to our gasoline tax. Everybody who buys gasoline pays that tax. We raised a tax on liquor to pay for an upgrade to state Drivers Ed courses focusing on drunk driving. All the tourists bringing all that tequila back from Mexico pays for the whole program. It added like a nickel or something to the cost of a bottle of liquor. That makes sense. You recall the Dont Mess With Texas litter campaign? A few pennies from every hotel room rented in the state paid for that. Tourists litter they pay for us to remind them not to.

1158495,0,t1_chzxs3o,Thats interesting stuff but I dont think either of those are particularly credible sources when it comes to this type of legal analysis. Especially given the fundamental and almost inexcusable error made by ThinkProgress most if not all jurisdictions dont actually require the victim to have said no. They require the victim to prove that they did not consent. Most jurisdictions dont even require that this lack of consent be expressed at all! Obviously evidence that you expressed a lack of consent is good evidence that you did not consent. But ThinkProgress is mistaken that a verbal or written no is required of victims. Which is why I believe theyre mistaken in thinking that a law such as the one proposed here would require a verbal or written yes.If nonverbal and unwritten behavior constitutes evidence of a lack of consent then I see no reason to think that such behavior would not also constitute evidence of consent.,Libertarian,chzy5am,0,t5_2qh63

I agree there are certain tax advantages to employerprovided insurance but that doesnt change my views on this issue.gt First Employees dont earn their health insurance. Employees earn their wages that they use to purchase their health insurance at a reduced rate through their employers benefits programs.Which is part of the total compensation package offered by the employer to employee.  You earn that compensation package by working.  Chances are if your employer was not providing health insurance he would have extra money to pay you a higher wage.  gt Second The employee doesnt get to choose how the coverage works. You buy a specific plan through your employer and you have things that are covered and things that arent. In this case now their coverage doesnt include a particular subset of contraceptives.Sure and in a completely unregulated free market employers would be free to set whatever type of plans they wanted however they probably wouldnt do so because there wouldnt be all the tax advantages.I can absolutely see the argument that the government cant or shouldnt dictate what sort of benefits are offered in health insurance plans.  However the Supreme Court has said otherwise and in the status quo the feds do have the right to dictate minimum coverage levels for health insurance.In that context the question becomes do religious people who incorporate forprofit businesses have to provide the same mandated benefits as nonreligious people who incorporate forprofit businesses?  My answer to that question is hell yes.  Your religion does not excuse you from laws of general applicability and more than a religiouslymotivated pacifist doesnt have to pay taxes because they could fund a war.gt If they dont like the benefits that are provided to them as part of their program then they are allowed to use their other money to go and get more benefits. The idea here is that Hobby Lobby has decided to opt out of providing that coverage.In violation of a dulyenacted law.  Again if we were in a system where employers had unlimited discretion to choose what benefit plans are offered then this wouldnt have even been an issue.  But we are not in such a system and religious people should have to follow the same rules as the rest of us.gt Now without getting into passing laws and such that complicate the matter further lets say your employer decides they dont want to offer investment opportunities that revolve around something they are morally opposed to. SO they remove it. Now you have fewer investment opportunities but you still have the option to use the program. You also have the option to not use the program and take you rmoney to the open marketplace and invest it in whatever you want.Sure I dont think that a voluntary employer decision to not offer certain benefits is the problem here.  The problem is there is a law on the books that removes that discretion from employers and the Supreme Court has held that only certain employers get to ignore that law.  gt You arent being prevented from doing anything with your money. You are using the money you earn to buy a product from a company at a reduced rate. That company has decided to change their offerings to you. Thats their right as a private entity.I wouldnt have an issue if that was the rule across the boardi.e. all businesses get the right to decide whatever benefits they want.  But this decision does not extend that right to private employers who arent religious.  That is where I see a big problemthe idea that religious people can just opt out of generally applicable laws.,Libertarian,cimngcx,1,t5_2qh63

Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army another had two sons captured.Nine of the  fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.They signed and they pledged their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor.What kind of men were they?Twentyfour were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants nine were farmers and large plantation owners men of means well educated but they signed the Declaration of Independenceknowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.Carter Braxton of Virginia a wealthy planter and trader saw his ships swept from the seas by theBritish Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts and died in rags.Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him and poverty was his reward.Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery Hall Clymer Walton Gwinnett Heyward Ruttledge and Middleton.At the battle of Yorktown  Thomas Nelson Jr. noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters. He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed and Nelson died bankrupt.Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife and she died within a few months.John Hart was driven from his wifes bedside as she was dying. Their  children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished.So take a few minutes and silently thank these patriots. Its not much to ask for the price they paid.Remember freedom is never free!Let us hope our weapons are never needed but do not forget what the common people knew when they demanded the Bill of Rights An armed citizenry is the first defense the best defense and the final defense against tyranny. If guns are outlawed only the government will have guns. Only the police the secret police the military the hired servants of our rulers. Only the government  and a few outlaws.

1463354,0,t1_cizoylq,I am not sure to be honest. For drugs I know a large part of the cost is to cover the immense RampD costs associated with them. Since they are also usually patented for many years the company that created the medication are the only ones that can producesell it. That stops the competition from generics for many years. This is also why many drugs get repurposed for other treatments after the patent wears out so you can repatent it. That would be my best guess in terms of prescription medications at least. For the end patient i think it goes along with what i mentioned earlier about reimbursements. For the provider I would assume its a everyone else is doing it type thing though economically Id agree that doesnt make sense. Again for that case I am speculating and honestly dont know.,Libertarian,cizph25,1,t5_2qh63

1465298,0,t1_cizs8ws,You do realize that I can think for myself correct?  It is a weak argument to claim that I have been programmed or brainwashed when you dont know anything about me or my life experiences.  Yet you jump to this conclusion simply because I disagree with your view on government.  I do believe that justice is better administered via the governments power because the source of the governments power is the people who create that same government and the interests of justice are better served under the rule of law rather than the whims of mob justice.  You have this childish and perhaps paranoid view of government as some monolithic oppressor hell bent on taking away all of your freedoms when in reality the government IS defined in our founding documents as being of the people.  Again though that doesnt mean we shouldnt have a reasonable healthy skepticism of government and its role. I do believe that men are inherently capable of evil and so do you and I can prove it simply by noting the fact that you lock your doors at night.  Why do you do this if you trust your fellow man so much?I also know very well the definition of essential which is absolutely necessary extremely important.  Note This definition begs the question necessary for what?  Mere survival as you claim food water shelter or perhaps something broader security the pursuit of happiness justice equality etc.  All of these things that government provides which you so readily dismiss as things that we have been programmed to think we need from the government when in reality these are things people in this country have deemed necessary want and have fought for.  You also state that Im telling you that men are no less capable of living as free beings than any other animal is. and that I cant even conceive of this idea.  Sure I can.  But I dismiss it as being nonpractical because we are a civilized people who have come out of the cave and advanced as human beings who seek to interact with one another.  Again this goes back to my point of interaction.  As soon as humans decided to interact with one another they needed rules be it in tribal form or a formal government for more complex societies such as ours. You are correct that the idea of absolute freedom is a thought experiment and nothing that will be implemented in reality but not because people have been programmed to think that way.  Political theorists from Locke to Hobbs to Rousseau have all discussed your questions at length and they all conclude that the the state of nature or natures law was not enough to ensure tranquility within societies and so they strongly advocated civil societies with governments involved in settling disputes and maintaining order.  You might serve yourself well to read up on these theorists.  Lastly I find it interesting that you think living in the state of nature would be so much better when you obviously have not.      ,Libertarian,cizy8g7,1,t5_2qh63

1470135,0,t1_cj0jp4n,.  No I am not new here  infact rLibertarian is my primary subreddit to read and comment in..  and has been for the entire  years of my membership here  about  of my comments are in rLibertarian . I clearly explained the difference in my original post  go back and read it this time attempt to actually understand things. In an effort to educate I will give you a hint.  When government talks about and enforces rules about public safety it does so in an abstract manner  meaning the government will pass a rule deeming an activity unsafe even if there is no actual victim or no one actually in danger  for example a cop can give me a ticket for crossing the yellow line while driving even if I am on a deserted road with no other moving cars.  This is done for public safety however my position holds there must be someone ACTUALLY IN DANGER IN THAT MOMENT for any punishmentliability to occur.  So in your shooting into the air hypothetical  the government can and has ruled that activity dangerous and would arrest you even if your standing in the middle of a field and shooting in the direction where you are  sure there is no single person and no one is actually in danger.  The activity itself has be ruled unsafe...  therefore punishable even when no one is in any actual danger at that time.  That is the difference abstract vs literal it is far far from semantics .

You have to identify if violence is a good indicator of possible homicide this requires knowing what percent of battered women ended up killed or defended themselves from a likely homicide.Effectively this conclusion says major ways to decrease intimate partner homicide is to identify women at risk and help them not be at risk. Umm yeah...This study is worst than useless.

Medicaid exists.  Medicare exists.  If they didnt then perhaps we could talk about PPACA as strictly costnegative.  But an individual that goes on unemployment because hes rendered unemployable thanks to a chronic back injury isnt zerocost for our federal system.  Hes going to land in Medicaid given time and then were saddled with his costs.What Goodman doesnt advocate in this article is the abolishment of all federal health care spending.

Not what I said  youre missing my point. It goes to the nature of the robbery. Someone who robs to feed their starving child is far more respectable than someone who robs to feed their pot habit.

1703670,0,t3_2dwvp4,gt Mike Brown was engaged in a strong arm robbery Lets be clear about what strong arm robbery means in this case.  If you watch the video these kids a stole a box of cigars and b pushed the store owner when he tried to stand in their way while they were leaving.  That hardly establishes that he was some kind of hardened copkilling criminal.  I would wager a lot of welltodo suburban white kids have also engaged in petty theft.gt People have dismissed this because Officer Wilson didnt know about the robbery. It is still relevant because it shows that Brown was behaving violently within minutes of the shooting.Again lets be clear the violence youre talking about is a shove to get a guy out of his way.  Its a huge leap from shove store owner to charge at cop with murderrage.gt The cop said he was assaulted and pushed into the car. This is corroborated by the fact the cop was taken to the hospital for facial injuries.We havent seen the cops official account or anything about the nature of these facial injuries.  Even if we assume for the sake of argument that Brown was tussling with the cop that does not mean that the cop is justified in using lethal force.gt A video release with an eyewitness claiming Brown had doublebacked and was charging the cop. This is corroborated by the autopsy which shows he was  times in the front and had one shot in the top of the head lunging forward.Which may or may not be true.  We dont know who this eyewitness was we dont know if he has some bias against the victim or towards the police etc.  gt I dont know if a close to lb man was charging me I would shoot him. Im not going to bet on me being able to kick his ass even if I had a club and taser.But youre not a cop with training in handtohand combat and you arent expected and trained to keep your cool in a situation like this.  This cop should be held to a higher standard than a random guy off the street.Personally I think theyve got more than enough to charge him with at least manslaughter on the theory that he used excessive force.  I fail to see why you need to shoot an unarmed kid  times even if he was charging at you.  ,Libertarian,cjtwr8n,-8,t5_2qh63

Should the state allow the child to die for their parents religion?A step further what about parents who believe in the use of an alternative medicine that is known by mainstream medical science to be poisonous like the socalled Miracle Mineral Supplement which is pretty much just highconcentration industrial bleach.  Should the state allow the parents to poison their kids out of the heartfelt belief that theyre helping?If adults want to do these things to themselves I have no objection but I do think its reasonable that given the existence of tens of millions of citizens who arent competent to care for themselves and are entirely at the mercy of caregivers with no particular qualifications the state does have a responsibility to intercede on behalf of those citizens in extreme cases like child abuse.

Your removed comment was im going to guess some money was involved. This kind of comment does not add to the conversation debate or understanding of the subject. A well thought out critique of the methods analysis or conclusions would be a great contribution. Evidence that the researchers were funded by a biased source would be useful for weighing the evidence. Citing previous research that found different results and discussing this would have been wonderful. Instead you gave an opinion with no evidence discussion or punctuation. rscience is not rconspiracy. If you want to discuss bias you actually have to show that there is some. That of course didnt get you banned. We already had notes on your account because you were hostile to other users in our sub. Youve had multiple comments removed that were racist and which used inappropriate language. So this wasnt your first offense. Not by a long shot. But the straw that broke the camels back was how you behaved towards us in modmail. We consider modmail private but if you give me permission Im happy to quote you including the very rude term you used. If you have nothing to hide it shouldnt be an issue. However if you prefer to keep that private other users can easily look at your history to see the kinds of things you say publicly on other subs. Those kinds of comments and that attitude aimed at us in modmail is why you were banned. Users are always welcome to provide sourced and thoughtful critiques of research posted in the sub. Also please review our comment rules as the fact that it was a top level comment is irrelevant. ,Libertarian,ckb6n76,7,t5_2qh63

The South seceded because they had lost control of the federal government and feared that without this control slavery and thus the political and economic power of the South would fade naturally. Compare the Civil War with the Nullification Crisis of  when South Carolina actually tried to secede over states rights i.e. the right not to be subject to federal tariffs. This secession sputtered and failed utterly. There was simply no support in the South for secession and the armed conflict that would result from such a secession over mere states rights. Slavery on the other hand was the foundation of the South and something very much worth fighting and dying for if necessary.Also Id suggest you read up more on the history of slavery in the US and the US Constitution because statements like thisgt Interestingly enough the south actually did have a fairly well laid out plan to get rid of slavery starting by banning slave trading and importation of slaves. Not perfect but a good enough start.Are false. The importation of slaves had been banned across the entire US by the Federal government in  and the reason it happened then and not sooner is because the Constitution promises to continue to allow slave imports for  years. ,Libertarian,ckofzhe,0,t5_2qh63

Adams style libertarians. Ones that would choose isolation over military action with no other justification falling within libertarian ideals apart from just not wanting to take lives.

How little liberty existed in places like Warsaw France and throughout the mousellini empirethird reich.

You dismiss the argument for intervention from the libertarian perspective before even listening to it you ignorant fucking twit. I dont want people like you in my party. Wheres the reasonable party? The party that adapts to current events rather than claim a set of concrete truths and policy? Im telling you those ways are bullshit. Its time to move beyond that.

An individual cant close off a roadway even if he does own the land because hed be interfering with general commerce.That said theres a huge difference between allowing an easement and allowing destruction of a persons property through reckless operation of a vehicle.  If youre going to plow through someones front yard going a hundred miles an hour in a Hummer youre doing something significantly different than wandering past said front yard on your legs.And even past all that the idea of an easement is built into the concept of property as defined by the municipal government.  The government is the institution by which laws are established and enforced.  Easements dont exist absent a governing authority that designates rules for property ownership.If you simply have two private individuals making land claims on contest with one another there is no defined concept of property or easements.  All you have is two individuals in an unresolved dispute.,Libertarian,clbqqm0,1,t5_2qh63

Most people dont call speeders illegal drivers or drug users illegal crack addicts because the crime is what is illegal not the person.  Illegal immigrant carries the connotation that person is illegal.  Or in the case of illegal alien the connotation that the individual is not in fact a person.  The term illegal alien also carries the connotation that you support immigration laws.  And its silly to say you support immigration laws and also support natural rights.If you believe in immigration laws you believe that the government should be able to prohibit the freedom to travel the freedom to associate and the freedom to voluntarily exchange goods and services.  If you believe the government can strip people of those rights then you dont believe these rights are inalienable.  Rights that arent inalienable are not natural but legal rights instead.

The Constitution was intended to shape and more importantly restrict the federal government to allow the already extant states to carry on as they saw fit.Now remember the Bill of Rights only came about because the AntiFederalists were cynical and didnt trust the federal government to refrain from grabbing power.

The federal government has been granted an explicitly narrow list of powers  ensuring the individual rights of every citizen in every state is not one of them and this is by design.

We dont need that many doctorsnot to mention robots could do most procedures eventually. Should everyone try and be an actor? well we dont need that many actorsCGI might get so goodcheap we dont need any. Ok Ok every one can design automation equipment. Wait we dont need that many people doing that. Well surely we need people repairing the robotsautomation equipment. Perhaps not if we get robotics and automation sophisticated enough that we can create repair bots and  guy can set  repair bots about their tasks. See where I am going? All that is really left is the service sector and we cant support a large part of the population working in the service sector. Backing away from the absurd I assume at some point the absurd will become reality. It may be  years from now it may be  years from now it may be  years from now. What solutions do you see out there for maintaining a functioning society where there is only paying jobs for  of the population? Perhaps we could create a system where every one is educated until  and only works for  years making enough to sustain them for the rest of their very likely extended lifetime.  The free rider problem is only a problem if you see people doing nothing but keeping money flowingUBI will never cover enough to save. They have to spend all of their money to survive and they are buying things made by the producers. With out people able to buy a product the producer cant sell the product. Ideally free riders would spend their time bettering themselves creating art volunteering just thinking. UBI would give Joe tinkerer a safety net to tinker in his garage and come up with the next PC. If self sufficiency is something you hold in high regard it would be impossible sell you on UBI. UBI requires a society that wants to work together to lift every one up. Societal sufficiency so to speak. If you can see that there might become a time when there are very few paying jobs what would your solution be and would you wait until it happens or is there a good enough chance that it will happen that we should start down the path of solving the problem?I know this is a hard sell around these parts and I dont fully agree with UBI but I do see it as a potential solution.

Beyond the basics however government is a tool used by the more powerful to grossly violate the less powerfuls consent and that is a situation that needs to be ended.Liberalism seems to think that consent only applies in a few limited sexual situations and is willing to trash it at all other times libertarianism thinks that there are no exceptions to consent. ,Libertarian,clvv9u5,1,t5_2qh63

The receivables written off by the hospital would be whatever was billed to the patient.

2322617,0,t1_clyinqo,Not necessarily temporal spending is self defeating. As soon as it works and others go out of business then when prices are raised the supply will want to pick up. Then the higher they jack up the prices the more the people will desire to enter the market. Now this is not to say that Im defending the practice or referring to it as all part of the game. I do think that this is one off the few examples of justified use of anti trust. However anti trust is I believe over used as making the case between temporal losses and natural efficiency can be gray until later down the road. Ie seeing if they end up keeping the price low or jack it up. This is I believe one of the only sure ways to make that conclusion.The only way that a monopoly happens and lasts is when either supply is forcibly restricted as with diamonds or theres greater efficiency as was the case with Rockefeller or when theres innovation and the market hasnt caught up as with the iPhone though for now we will but discuss patents.However the clear distinction to be made is between natural monopolies and predatory monopolies. Im sure we can all agree that natural ones are fine as they dont prevent others from either entering the market or from doing it better. Its the predatory or unnatural ones I think we all worry about as they are the ones that leave us truly worse off. Though it is worth mentioning again that it is very difficult to prove the difference and often that decision is influenced by politics and the respective companies competition just as we now see with patent wars. ,Libertarian,clysf8e,1,t5_2qh63

Socialization skills are learned with organized homeschooling group meetups at playgrounds parks peoples homes and through participation in school sports many schools allow homeschooled kids to play sports.

But if society decides everyone has to pay  because of some crisis for instance that could cause way more hardship than taxes then it certainly is justified.

2672449,0,t3_2qmdfj,There are two problems when it comes to defining and identifying genuine libertarians. Innately individualists reject blanket labels and collective associations. Instead of everyone agreeing on the term libertarianism you have a plethora of terms for proponents of individual liberty including but not limited to voluntarism market anarchy market liberalism libertarianism classic liberalism right libertarianism right liberalism and anarchocapitalism. Of course there are very real differences between many of these terms  however the central focus on individual rights is common.. There is an intentional push to distort common political terms that people tend to associate around. On the left you have liberals claiming to be progressive. These terms have been swapped before. On the right you have conservatives claiming to be libertarians. The notion that say Hillary Clinton or Obama are progressive in any meaningful sense is absurd. Similarly the notion that any Bush family member or Glenn Beck are libertarian is absurd. I recall a Democratic strategist on Hardball a few years ago claiming to be a conservative because he believed in environmental conservation. These misappropriations of terms are intentional.When Elizabeth Warren denounces certain Republicans for being anarchists shes playing into that same sort of game intentionally blurring the line separating the meaning of one term from another. The problem is both political and linguistic we trap ourselves into denouncing one another based upon the words we use and the politicians are at least smart enough to realize this. The solution is simple on paper but likely impossible to ever be adopted globally or even nationally.Consider what J.R.R. Tolkien had to say on the matterMy political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy philosophically understood meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs  or to unconstitutional Monarchy. I would arrest anybody who uses the word State in any sense other than the inanimate realm of England and its inhabitants a thing that has neither power rights nor mind and after a chance of recantation execute them if they remained obstinate! If we could get back to personal names it would do a lot of good.Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so as to refer to people. If people were in the habit of referring to King Georges council Winston and his gang it would go a long way to clearing thought and reducing the frightful landslide into Theyocracy.Anyway the proper study of Man is anything but Man and the most improper job of any man even saints who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it and least of all those who seek the opportunity. And at least it is done only to a small group of men who know who their master is. The medivals were only too right in taking nolo efiscopari as the best reason a man could give to others for making him a bishop.With the exception of nolo efiscopari being italicized all points of emphasis are mine.,Libertarian,cn7eu0v,8,t5_2qh63

It is a niche yuppie market.  That means the bulk of the market will still demand the cheapest possible eggs which means a race to the bottom for animal rights and food safety.  Sometimes as in the case of animals that cant vote or use market forces to bring about change in a free market people need to mandate minimum standards.  I think if more people actually saw how most commercial chicken farms raised their chickens there would be overwhelming support for measures like this.  The trick is to balance the fight against animal cruelty with the need to maintain cheap staple food items.  That isnt easy to do I admit.  This measure just requires cages big enough for chickens to stand up and turn around in.  I dont think thats asking too much.,Libertarian,cnbgxod,2,t5_2qh63
2705911,0,t1_cnbk1el,I noticed you decided to pass on the first two rebuttals. I was hoping to see a response to those. Pity.Valid response. I stipulated no cops in short as theyre lowhanging fruit. Many people tend to point to them as paragons of safe handling and operation of firearms This would be a mistake in my opinion.If one does not operate or supervise the operation of others responsibly when a firearm is involved people can and have died. This can also happen with motor vehicles. Since no one of whom I have knowledge of is calling for the banning of motor vehicles at this time let us assume that assuming Ceteris Paribus most of us in the United States are prepared to live with the potential for mayhem and death possible to suffer and inflict either deliberately or negligentlyassociated with the possession storage and operation of motor vehicles. As operation of motor vehicles are said at least by my state to be a privilege one might think that they would be the focus of more attempts to ascertain the legal and mental state of motor vehicle operators.However as the right to keep and bear arms are a right and not a privilege there would need to be more of a case made to more heavily regulate firearms. In my state I have to submit a form to to the state ever time I go to my local FFL dealer and submit a Form  for the NICS check as well as a form to the state.What more would you have someone of the age of majority do in order to purchase a firearm?Just in case you wonder why Im engaging you I hope to eventually get you to to the point that you come to a place of tolerance and understanding about those of us who carry firearms whether in our homes or in public. Just a thought One is three times more likely to be murdered by police than by a CCWCPL holder.Also a firearms aficionado gun nut is pejorative tends to stay more in practice than police as a whole since it is an avocational pursuit.Im not a fan of offbody and I dont practice it. If one lives in a home with children one should start with educating the children that firearms are tools neither good nor bad.

2775779,0,t1_cnjkh0p,The college definitely built the human capital up even in cases where they foolishly get a degree in something like social work. The thing is that if its unmarketable then that means there is no demand for it. Its a bit like having a factory that is not needed by the market. The building and equipment essentially go to waste but if conditions in the economy change so that there is demand for what it produces the factory would add to prosperity. The fact of the matter is that if you look at BLS data on unemployment by education level there is a clear trend....the more education you have the better the unemployment rate. People without college have higher unemployment rates than people with college who in turn have higher unemployment rates than people with associates degrees and so on wages are higher as we go up the education ladder as well. So I guess I have a couple of points here. Highly visible things like college graduates having a hard time finding jobs or being underemployed may be a popular thing in media these days...but if you look at the actual data on the matter that compares unemployment and income level by education there is no comparison...education is verifiable a benefit at an individual level and in turn for the economy. My own anecdotal experience is that as soon as I got my associates and was able to add that to job applications i started receiving far more call backs. Even though they were shit jobs it certainly helped to have that advantage because ostensibly Id have had a much harder time getting a job period. Second point is that some economists would describe the problem that faces the economy as a lack of demand. So like the factory example I gave where it can do tons of work but is not needed college educated people are essentially in a similar position although to make the point again you are in a worse position if you dont have any education. Its unevenly spread as well for example there is no comparison between the job prospects for PhDs in English and PhDs in Engineering. This would be like the difference between two factories and one is producing something the economy demands and the other not so much. I hope that answered a question or two. On a side note I want to add that Im an undergrad econ majormath minor and I still have a year to completion so take me with a grain of salt. Im sure there is far far more to this than even I am aware. ,Libertarian,cnjlgvh,2,t5_2qh63

These are incredibly complex issues and its the equivalent of your neighborhood voting on how you should get heart surgery. Its an awful idea because they know next to nothing about heart surgery and even if they are well meaning you could end up with a shaman chanting over you on the operating table rather than a trained surgeon.Economic issues are like that. There is at best  of the population that can intelligently comment and argue about economic issues. They easily get drowned out in a vote by the  of people voting based on the attractiveness of the candidate.And ya know what its totally ok that most people do not know about economics or heart surgery. We shouldnt expect them to know it because these are difficult or confusing topics. But we sure as hell shouldnt let them vote on it if they are going to be so ignorant.gtIf they show up yes. If not no.There also has to be enough of them in the first place that if all of them showed up it would actually be a swing vote and the idiot population needs to be unbiased. Neither of those conditions hold true. So its a theoretical solution but not a real world one.gtWell we dont have direct democracy. We have representative democracy. So theres that.It helps a little. Politicians will get punished for tanking the economy even if they enact the exact policies voters asked for.gtBut yeah theres a lot of problems with our system. If you have ideas on how make it better Id love to hear them. But I dont see how not voting helps anything.My idea is quite simple and not voting works great.

2969734,0,t3_2u5d1a,Even Keynes new that inflation is theft.Lenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the capitalist system was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation governments can confiscate secretly and unobserved an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate but they confiscate arbitrarily and while the process impoverishes many it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires become profiteers who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month all permanent relations between debtors and creditors which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless and the process of wealthgetting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.

3037703,0,t1_cock4jp,Dismissing a perfectly valid safety concern just because its not terribly likely isnt a great idea. Risk management is about severity as well as likelihood and there are plenty of lowlikelihood but highseverity accidents waiting in the wings. There are all sorts of chemicals vehicles and machinery that are hard to get ahold of for good reason.     Cars are getting safer absolutely! And one of the key drivers of safety aside from customer satisfaction naturally is government regulation. No matter how poor and desperate for a car I am I cant buy and drive something thats likely to be unsafe. I cant build and sell a car thats not safe. And when I do build a car there are governmentregulated tests to uniformly describe how safe it is making comparison easier and fairer. The state doesnt have to directly administer every step but having a minimum baseline is very important.    Your comment about westerneastern values is both pretty wrong and pretty crass. Japan for instance has reliable road regulation and thus a low rate of accidents and death despite a culture that does not value human life as highly. It is African countries again with a lack of enforced regulation that suffer some of the highest fatality rates. The stats arent quite led by culture.   Casting that aside as you wish looking only at Western cultures does not refute my position. Road rules and human psychology are intimately involved people do breach rules with impunity sometimes simply because they are there. In smaller communities and areas away from large byways especially removing immediate road regulations results in a safer immediate environment. People are more aware of the responsibility they bear and act accordingly. In other areas this doesnt work quite as well. Regardless there are still plenty of rules at work in these areas. Regulations about the quality of road of vehicle and lighting most prominently.  Dont strawman or according to you please. Im not saying that we should always have more regulation on everything.

3040151,0,t1_cocz22y,Libertarianism is an umbrella under which a whole host of philosophical traditions can be found some complementary some contradictory.  They include minarchists and anarchists primitivists and transhumanists objectivists austrians mutualists and collectivists. Anarchocapitalists and anticapitalists.  Rightwingers and lefties.  Heres a fairly wellreasoned synthesis of Austrian economics and Marxist theory  The only requirement to being a libertarian is an emphasis on the value of liberty and the disvalue of coercion.If you need evidence of the size of the libertarian umbrella I present the list of subs to the right of this thread.If I were to imagine a sketch of OP Id guess that hes a moderatetoright leaning libertarian who liked Dr. Ron Paul but has some trepidation over his son.  The article posted shows Dr. Rand Paul explaining that most vaccines should be a matter of choice but some should not.  We can debate his libertarian ethic but not his familiarity with where libertarianism was philosophically derived or his medical knowledge.  He was intimately familiar to Mises Murry Rothbard Lew Rockwell so on.  As uWKorsakow pointed out Rothbard didnt see children as the property of their parents but instead individual agents whos rights need protecting.  When parents had the best interests of the child in mind theyre best suited to make those decisions.  When thats not the case children need to have an avenue of recourse.

There are so many inconvenient truths to libertarianism and nobody seems to want to address them  I get the same kind of nonanswerssocialist! responses when I ask about libertarianism and the environment.What usually happens as you run the full argument is that the libertarian position essentially turns into a form of utilitarianism where we have to recognize that all currently owned land is essentially stolen property but that we just need to pretend like all current claims are valid because not doing so is impractical and wed all just be better off if we wiped the slate clean now and just moved on using libertarian principles from now on.Of course once you surrender to utilitarianism youve essentially granted the entire liberalprogressive philosophy and you end up just having to argue the merits of each policy i.e. is the benefit of the program better than the cost of the program.And Im happy to do that. Im a liberal. Life is messy and decisions have to be made like this. But libertarianism I feel like and conservatism too to a large extent doesnt like that posture. Those philosophies tend to see themselves as crusading for some bedrock principle some fight for justice and virtue in a fallen world.

If we recognize that anarchy simply means a lack of government then through plain etymology anarchism is simply a belief in or advocation of anarchy.From wikipediagtAnarchism is a political philosophy that advocates stateless societies often defined as selfgoverned voluntary institutions but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on nonhierarchical free associations. Anarchism holds the state to be undesirable unnecessary or harmful. While antistatism is central anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations including but not limited to the state system.gtAs an antidogmatic philosophy anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism not all of which are mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is usually considered a radical leftwing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics.,Libertarian,covably,1,t5_2qh63

3241941,0,t3_2x9all,This is not BREAKING... This has been the case all along...Government and government intervention is pervasive in the entire telecommunications industry. Government and government intervention has distorted and even shaped markets for telecommunications and internet access as well as the entire paradigm of ownership surrounding the telecommunications infrastructure related to internet access. Telecommunications and more specifically internet service providers ISPs are currently regulated by the FCC. ISPs do not operate in a free market. Many ISPs are directly subsidized by the government the vast majority of ISPs have been granted government benefits and privileges and many ISPs operate in captured regulatory environments. Competition among ISPs is almost nonexistent in many places. The recent discussion has revolved around whether this regulation will exist as the current Title I classifications the likely expansion of this current classification often described as ancillary authority or be reclassified as Title II. I dont know that Title II classification is necessarily worse than the current Title I classification or the likely expansion of this classificationThe FCC and Net Neutrality A Way ForwardgtSome have said that reclassification would give the FCC too much power to regulate the Internet.  That very concern is why forbearance is so important.  Nor is it the case that the FCC has very limited power nowthe D.C. Circuit affirmed that the FCC has broad powers to promote competition which could be just as vulnerable to misuse by a future FCC as any regulatory authority granted via a common carrier reclassification. More important than the potential breadth of power however is the fact that the powers that the FCC has now dont match the real goal protecting the neutral Internet we expect and need to flourish. Reclassification combined as it must be with a commitment to forbear from imposing aspects of Title II that were originally drafted for th century telephone services and that dont make sense for the Internet can give the FCC the right tool for the job without giving it regulatory tools it doesnt need and may dangerously misapply.Net Neutrality FCC Trojan Horse ReduxgtWhatever your views on net neutrality this Title I expansion is a terrible idea. If you oppose the proposed FCC net neutrality regulations because you are worried about expansive federal regulation of the Internet then you should oppose an expansive reading of Title I ancillary authority because that reading would be an invitation for even more federal regulations down the road.,Libertarian,coy1977,6,t5_2qh63

They will witness the same wealth inequality the same corruption and the same police riding in pickup trucks all perpetrated by politicians that espouse the same socalled liberal values that alternet loves so much. Do they want taxes so high they cant afford consumer goods? Do they want a nationalized oil industry with high gas taxes yet bad roads? Do they want the government to be so corrupt that family of the Missing  refused to let the government investigate and forced them to bring in a foreign trusted team of investigators?  Do they want rural police force and local politicians working for organized crime? Do they want central planning and a stagnant economy? Theyre sitting in America acting like they shit gold when their way of thinking sucks in Latin America too. But I dont go around disparaging liberals and democratic socialists.

First it is not a contractual term for any temp organization to be the sole provider of work for a company.  They are allowed to hire other persons as they see fit.  What likely the horribly uninformed person should have said is that the company is unwilling to hire you as a temporary worker as the cost of doing so is astronomically higher hence why temp agencies exist in the first place.gtThen there is also contracts for exclusive rights to a product or service.Exclusivity agreements for products are far different than labor unions.

And when EA wouldnt agree to the NFLs proposed terms they then proceeded to claim that the negotiations werent being conducted in good faith and had the government intervene and impose EAs proposal on the NFL.

Its just the new system of racial control. The level of enforcement is vastly vastly vastly higher against blacks even though rates of offending for drug crimes are roughly equal between blacks and whites.  The drug war is used to confiscate peoples property and give it to the government and essentially all due process has been removed to prevent this. The ax falls most heavily not on those with the most property but on minorities.  The drug war is used to give people felony convictions which then prevents them from voting in some places ever again. This then works to de facto disenfranchise blacks. The drug war has enabled stopandfrisk and other unconstitutional policies and those policies are massively and overwhelmingly aimed at minorities particularly blacks.

3461490,0,t3_2zu7u8,gtTheres only one problem its a fairy tale. Such mischief has been legal for decades and ISPs have almost never behaved this way. Any ISP that created slow lanes or blocked content to consumers would be hurting its own bottom line.ISPs have most definitely been behaving this way for the better part of the last decade. Last years Netflix debacle was an example. Comcast and Verizon have been caught throttling torrent downloads and sued by the FCC.gt In one sense ISPs do have fast and slow lanes because customers can pay for higher speeds. So youre conflating two different things. Tiered pricing for end users is not what net neutrality is about and the open internet rules even said as much. Net neutrality aims to prevent the ISPs from using paid prioritization and throttling between networks to limit traffic.gtISPs have invested heavily in new infrastructure and Internet speeds have increased by leaps and bounds.. If this were the case then ISPs like Comcast Time Warner Verizon ATampT and others wouldnt be implementing data caps for customers.. If this were the case then why are ISPs protesting the FCCs recent decision to increase the definition of broadband Internet access from  Mbps down to  Mbps down? . Why when their customers want to use data from other networks like Netflix through Cogent are the ISPs trying to double dip and force content providers to pay extra for their customers usage if the ISPs have been investing so heavily in infrastructure? If they are improving their infrastructure and advertising how fast their infrastructure is then this should be no problem. They cant have it both ways. gt Contrary to the myth about ISPs being localized monopolies  percent of Americans live in markets with access to multiple highspeed ISPs.In most places the competition is a bad substitute. You mention DISH internet in your article. Thats a shitty alternative to cable because. Its nearly double the average cable ISP price.. Satellite Internet is data capped around  gb of normal daytime usage per month. Sometimes they have unlimited usage at night between  am and  am but thats not usable for most people. . Satellite is okay for delivering TV but its horrible for data applications because data needs to go from your house to space back to earth to the satellite data center to the remote data center and then make its way back through the same path.

3482606,0,t1_cpokaik,man i love it when socialists like myself and libertarians such as yourself express the same goals. im not being sarcastic in the slightest bit. it gives me hope for the future. we both want to see an end to the Federal Reserve as it exists today the only difference is the closest party to my political point of view Socialist Party USA explicitly mention the national bank in their platform. to be clear i dont have a problem with a central bank im not convinced  that it would be a good thing to remove. weve had competing central banks before and no central banks and it was pretty unstable. the SP USA platform is to replace the private federal reserve with a  transparent  democratically operated public central bank among other things.gtFirstly the income tax was only necessary to secure the interests of the Fed because they needed a direct tax on the People. Take this away and the power of the Fed becomes diminished. It was pushed through Congress based on lies just a few months before the Federal Reserve Act of .well we both know thats not exactly true. we had both taxes and a central bank together and separately several times since the founding of the country and the establishment of the federal reserve.gtWhile I myself dont subscribe to the LP it seems clear to me judging by their platform it is against the Fed  once we understand what the Fed actually is and the logical conclusions drawn from the LPs platform.Ron Paul and Gary Johnson two of the most recent libertarian candidates I can think of both have expressed support for ending the Fed. Selfish and unscrupulous people have ceded power from the people to an unelected unaccountable wealthy class at the top. They know that libertarians and other antifed activists are a threat to their survival. Thats why they pump money into politicians who support it thats why they control the media to marginalize libertarians and anyone else that is against this plutocratic behemoth including socialists.They know libertarianism is about seizing power from the plutocratic class and empowering the individual. They will never support something that is a direct threat to their existence. If youre going to sit here and tell me that libertarianism is favorable for those whom thrive on the system that extracts wealth from the people and gives it to the wealthy ruling class Im gonna just have to politely disagree.im very glad that you feel this way seriously. but ive had this conversation repeatedly in this sub and most of the FED conversations ive had tend to disagree with you. personally it sounds like you more closely represent libertarianism in the modern sense of the word than most of the people here who think they are libertarian. but you certainly dont represent the term in its entirety.but sadly i must admit i remain unconvinced by the vagueness of the LPs platform on this issue. without explicitly mentioning the federal reserve as they so conveniently leave out we could argue that their only talking about local banks or commercial banks or whatever. while the SP more concretely mentions not only a central bank but also competing cooperatives and credit unions for replacing the financial system in its entirety. im not convinced that the LP is advocating for anything that drastically different than what we already have. different yes but not by much.back to my original point there are simply too many policies that big corporations and libertarians advocate together. including deregulation of almost every industry especially the financial industry as well as deregulating the lobbying market. and others of course but these  issues alone are insanely huge to me. youve got to ask yourself some serious questions when the half of the institutions you supposedly oppose government and corporations advocate a lot of the same policies that you support.if you want bring an end to corporate welfare and our megalithic banks great im right there with you. but i highly doubt libertarianism is the right way for you to go.other than that im glad we are on the same page when it comes to our failed financial system.,Libertarian,cpp8qns,1,t5_2qh63

But lets say  this antiLGBT business manages to stumble around with a few of its customers. So what then?

Is it to make available the very obvious choice of the LGBT community to use said business?

3583905,0,t1_cq0mprd,gt My point is that under libertarian thinking you have no right to participate in the marketplaceYou are continuing to equivocate. The right to participate in a market doesnt entail the right to make exchanges that are involuntary. If someone wants to engage in trade with you but you have moral misgivings about what the trade is for then refusing to trade is not equivalent to denying them from participating in the market. As I explained a free market especially in the libertarian tradition can only exist where exchange is cooperative. Whether you accept the use of the word free here is inconsequential and as far as Im concerned you havent provided a sufficiently well defined alternative.gt If you can prohibit people from participating in the market for noneconomic reasons then you are saying people have no right to participate in a marketI have answered why this is not a prohibition. Further economics is a  nonnormative science. All decisions and actions that are part of an exchange process are economic and the judgments and behavior of humans is economic in so far as it is purposeful and willed about to achieve some end.gt You dont believe in a freemarket you believe in a voluntary marketThese are inexorable terms. I will reiterate that all youve done so far is equivocate on the meaning of free.gt  Ultimately it is property owners who dictate how the market moves not the consumers in libertarian philosophy.This is the case for all social economy. In the market economy property interests drive production which dictates the market process a la Says Law. In the socialist commonwealth production tsars dictate the activity of property interests and the resulting production. It is inaccurate to say that consumption shapes the economic landscape.

3587189,0,t3_31fcgj,The linked article does not have much content but the article linked within it is very interesting gtOne of the first experiments to test the debasement hypothesis is one conducted by Marwell and Ames . In this study the social scientists designed a prisoners dilemmatype game where participants were given an allotment of tokens to divide between a returngenerating private account and a public fund. If every player invested all of their tokens in the public fund they would all end up with a greater return than if they had all put their money into their respective private accounts. However if a player defected and invested in the private account while the other players invested in the public fund she would gain an even larger return. In this way the game was designed to promote freeriding the socially optimal behavior would be to contribute to the public fund but with respect to economic theory the dominant strategy would be to defect.gt Marwell and Ames found that most subjects divided their tokens nearly equally between the public and private accounts. Economics students by contrast invested only  of their tokens in the public fund on average.gtOther studies supported these key findings. Frey Pommerehne and Gygi  report that economics students are less likely to consider a vendor who increases the price of bottled water on a hot day to be acting unfairly. Cadsby and Maynes  find that economics and business students are more prone to defect even in games that have been tweaked to create an efficient equilibrium that can be reached by cooperating. Selten and Ockenfels  find that economics students who played a lottery game were willing to commit less of their potential winnings to fund a consolation prize for losers than were their peers. Frank and Schulze  find that economics students were significantly more corruptible in that they were more likely to accept bribes than other students. A survey conducted by Gandal Roccas Sagiv and Wrzesniewski  find that economics students valued personal achievement and power more than their peers while attributing less importance to social justice and equality. Rubinstein  reports that economics students were much more likely to favor profit maximization over promoting the welfare of workers when faced with a business dilemma. Faravelli  finds that economics students were significantly less likely to favor egalitarian solutions to problems than their peers outside of economics. Haucap and Just  find that a survey of economists revealed they were more likely than their peers to consider the allocation of scarce resources in accordance with who can afford to pay the price set by supply and demand to be a fair method of rationing and distributing resources.

Just because I disagree with the political opinion does not give me a right to release massive amounts of information to the public.  There is a reason that information is classified.  Now our enemies have intimate knowledge of our offensive and defensive cyber capabilities.  A lot of people did not like the whiskey tax but George Washington still quelled that rebellion.  They had representation.  There are so many ways to whistle blow and report ethics violations within the D.O.D. it is ridiculous.  He only tried a couple didnt follow up and they were the wrong ones in the first place.  Part of the issue is that contractors are not treated as employees in government and instead like second class citizens.  They dont have access to the same reporting information as government civilians but they can still utilize them.  Ive seen a lot of ethical violations in person and taken care of quite a few of them myself.  The higher up ones can be disheartening but they get taken care of all the time within military courts and other appropriate methods.A lot of the problem with this issue is also that people dont understand it fully.  They think that one and one equals two when it is far faaaaar more complex like any other real world issue.  People look at what one arm of the nsa has the capability to do and apply it with the jurisdiction of another arm of it.  Example One arm of the offensive end of the NSA has supposedly broken   They must be using this preemptively and against their own networks!!  Zero day exploits are a part of cyber offense.  Thats how cyber wars are fought.  You cant give away all your capabilities until your enemies have also broken it.Tldr  Not blind patriotism people are blinded by trying to simplify an extremely complex problem.  This is especially true of Snowden himself and it doesnt excuse his actions.You may disagree with my opinion but I hope you can at least see that it isnt blind patriotism.

They care about order and maintaining the system. The point and again you dont have to agree with it is that policing in a place like Baltimore is from the perspective of the author who was black and grew up there just a constant state of violence coming from a gang. This gang was called the police but from the perspective of the black community that didnt mean much. Law is just the name of the thing which let this gang run rampant.And so why do the cries for peace and all the outrage at the violence only come into play when the violence is done by looters? Why werent we getting lectures about peace and nonviolence when Freddie Grey was killed? Well the answer is that peace and nonviolence isnt the real issue. Order and obedience is the issue.

So yes I have a problem with it.You mean like giving gay people the personal liberty to buy cakes from any bakery they wish to buy them?Forcing someone to do something for you is not liberty no matter which way you spin it.  It doesnt matter how butt hurt you are about the fact that someone has to walk an extra  minutes to buy a cupcake.Claiming to support the NAP while being opposed to anarchy is being a hypocrite.You most certainly can support NAP and be opposed to anarchy.  The libertarian view defines an act of aggression as an encroachment on another persons life liberty or justly acquired property.  Your convoluted example makes no sense.  The government does not own private property.  The fact that you dont understand this basic tenant of law makes me wonder about your education level.Why is it okay for business owners to set rules but not okay for government to set rules?Because the business owners arent telling people what to do and the government is.  The business owner is saying I will not serve a gay person.  Theyre not saying I will prevent anyone from serving a gay person.  This argument is very simple.  You are wrong.  I am right.  The end.For the record I think its stupid not to serve a gay person and I think that Christian values actually encourage people to serve all people regardless of race gender or sexual orientation.  However if you believe in liberty you have to tolerate the liberty of bigots because if you dont your liberty is not protected either.

Any CPS case has somewhat special standing for investigation meaning that for better or for worse when a CPS complaint is lodged and is deemed necessary to investigate the children must be questioned alone without the parents. Can this be horrendously abused by people with a vendetta against your family yes. But it also means that you will have a reasonable chance of removing kids from truly awful situations by getting the real story from them. Now the legalityrights issues of things aside if you physically try to prevent your kids from being interviewed it appears that is what happened its pretty much instant grounds for temporary removal while things are sorted. Im attempting to be nonjudgmental of the system but it appears that in manymost states that it has been decided that the rights of children to be free from abuse defined in various ways is greater than an immediate right to parents to have children with them at all times. It seems if you wanted to fight this system or the distaste some people have for the various forms of freerange parenting that you would comply temporarily prove that it was a baseless investigation and protestpetitionseek recourse based on that rather than try to resist some unfortunate social worker who is underpaid overworked and trying not to burn out from seeing real abuse go on.Source Wife has done SWTherapy for years good friend used to be a field SW caseworker in KY and living in KY with some familiarity of the system.,Libertarian,cr4ggdf,22,t5_2qh63

A person that is a libertarian because they think that the government weakens the ability for individuals to live their own lives as they want to would be more likely to take benefits because they paid into the system so they theyd be stupid not to.

No one answers. They look at you and they smile but they dont say its free. You take a cookie and eat it.When you leave you notice police and the security guard pointing at you conferring with officers. You are arrested for shoplifting because you didnt get consent and they decided to accuse you or theft. OR under this law this could happen they DO say its free so you eat one.

Of course Im sure he did not get to everyone but he got to many.My issue with Bernie Sanders if I am understanding your post correctly is that his answer to everything is solved by more taxes fees etc.  I also find this with his supporters. On his FB posts I have tried to bring up responses with his followers and engage in debate but it seems pointless bc fundamentally there is a difference in perspective of what property is. In order for me to engage with Bernie Sander supporters I would first have to engage in the property aka money and labor debate with them. I find that most liberals dont really discuss this idea and their logic is always either  I think X should be free for everyone therefore let us tax people so we can provide it or  I want X and X is too expensive for me to buy on my own therefore lets tax everyone so the cost is shared.  Because of these fundamentalprincipled differences it is just takes too much effort for me to engage.  Just my opinion.  I personally dont really see Bernie Sanders as the same as Obama but I do see that the political pendulum tends to swing back and forth and people get tired of  party for too long. ,Libertarian,crgp2j7,1,t5_2qh63

It appears to me that hese arguments arent necessarily mutually exclusive.If we start with the total value of the labour created a percentage of that is paid as a wage to the labourer and then a percentage of that wage is taxed by the government. If you view the total value of the labour as the real wage the labourer should get then both business and government are taxing the labourer.No matter which company the labourer goes to he will never be paid the full value of his labour. Thus the similarity with tax in that it is unavoidable even if ostensibly voluntary.The difference is that the company cannot as of yet coerce the labourer.

4111707,0,t1_croq07x,Well for starters I didnt say anything about all libertarians. Just you.Why do so many libertarians like to preach poverty as a morality tale?So whats your point about poverty?  Do you have an actual point?  Youre the one thats accusing me on my position.  If you want to simultaneously solve the educational problems AND poverty knock yourself out.  But understand that youre moving into another area that I wasnt addressing but that you dragged into the conversation.If you would like me to solve it for you via Libertarianism just say so but understand youre opening up a HUGE can of worms that impacts everything.  Otherwise Ill just say since its unlikely a private system would be completely private or that there would be much money in educating the dullards that must be forced to go to school you might keep one state school for those students.  The school that students would be threatened with in the private school should they get out of line.  And no good students would immediately be picked out by the private ones since theyd want good students.  But you could have the state offer tax breaks to take poorer students to encourage that.The proof is in how competition works in a free market.  The proof is when you walk into one of the many different drug stores and see the difference in prices in the various brands for sale.  Multiple choices in products means that the makers compete for your dollar.  Have you ever been to a store?How does a private system automatically encourage parent involvement?When most people purchase a product theyd like to get use out of that product.  They dont just throw it away.Why is getting rid of all public schooling inherently cheaper?Public schools and for that matter all government programs have no profit motive.  Therefore they dont care about how much money they spend.  The people that work for the state know that if they dont use their budget in a year it gets lowered.  That could mean more work less raises or getting your department merged with another which could mean a move less power or even a demotion.  What bureaucrat would do that?  Therefore and you can ask just about anyone in school administration schools spend money they dont really need if they have any leftover.  Its not that they have a lot of money to piss away but theres no incentive to save money unless your school is desperate to begin with or youre able to shift the excess of budgets to various departments.  Assuming youre an administration that even bothers to do that.I know several people that have worked in the state school system and they have told me this.  While some teachers had to sell stuff on Ebay just to get pencils and notebooks administrators would blow any budget money they had left at the end of the year just to get rid of it.  Additionally the school system is topheavy with administrators who are paid more and quite frankly do less than the teachers.So without the profit motive this is what you get.  With the profit motive all employees are encouraged to run things as efficiently as possible.  For profit businesses are constantly looking for ways to get rid of employees and cut costs.  And yes they may cut too much hurting the product but thats why customers have more choices.Is that enough proof for you or is there some kind of flaw in this logic?I dont know why.You dont know why rich politicians send their kids to private school?  Really?  You dont know why President Obama sends his children to a private school instead of a public one in D.C.?  You think its a security issue?  Really?  Cmon.  Youre being incredibly disingenuous here.  I think the last president to send his kid to public school was Jimmy Carter.  Amy Carter went to public school probably because Carter was the last president to give a shit.  They had Secret Service agents watch her.  So its possible.  At least Carter was smart enough to do this to at least pretend he cared about education.So lets try and be honest here.,Libertarian,croykoc,1,t5_2qh63

These people pool their resources to hire management staff who then proceed to procure every resource needed for running the business  raw materials parts a physical infrastructure labor  from willing sellers. This translates into then supplying goods and services in the marketplace potentially reaching billions of customers.Every single step along this way is done through voluntary contracts.Contracts can easily provide agreedto means for their enforcement and termination. The only thing that stands in the way of voluntarilyenforced contracts is the state. Those bajillions of contracts which result in consumerpleasing goods and services are widely open in scope except that the state prevents people from certain mutually beneficial transactions working for less than the minimum wage for example.In short as long as people are able to opt out of the states laws courts and police they can provide that for themselves privately.

4244144,0,t1_cs3ldrg,So in any system under which people have the right to something that requires scarce resources materials capital or labour implies that somewhere else within that system an obligation to provide. If I want the right to healthcare somebody out there must provide it to me  and its not must provide it to me if they feel like it because then if nobody felt like it I wouldnt get healthcare. Its must provide it to me regardless of whether or not they feel like it. And when you say somebody must do something regardless of whether or not they feel like it youre implying the use of force or the threat of force to make them do it. In this instance it could be the doctor rarely or the taxpayer who pays the doctor to make it worth her while very common. But in either case there is the threat of force  if I dont pay my taxes they will remove me from my home and put me in a cage. So then it comes down to what things are worth threatening violence to ensure everyone gets it. It causes quite some drama because the thing had better be pretty damn important because violence is a bit rubbish. Some would argue universal healthcare is that important which doesnt sound too unreasonable. I would probably argue that Id be more keen that its limited to effective lifesavingaltering healthcare. Couple that with the ideas that governments are pretty inefficient at doing almost anything on a large scale and that government getting involved in something crowds out private investment and development of that something you get to a situation where youre not choosing between free awesome perfect universal healthcare vs leaving everyone to die  youre choosing between pretty inefficient healthcare provided free to everyone and much more efficient healthcare provided free to a much smaller extent and paid to a much larger extent.

4309754,0,t1_csb545w,A flat tax appears to be flat because it taxes everyone at the same rate.  However income isnt flat.  That is as you earn more income your expenses do not increase unless you choose to spend more of course. A loaf of bread costs two bucks whether you make yr or yr. In other words your disposable income becomes a greater percentage of your total income  but your taxes remain the same.The underlying premise behind a progressive tax is that your taxes increase as your ability to pay them increases.  Again to put it another way a perfect progressive tax is one that hurts everyone the same.  So a flat tax is actually regressive in the sense that it burdens you less the more you make.In short regressive taxes are bad because they burden the middle class and the middle class drives the economy  not the rich.,Libertarian,csbfony,-2,t5_2qh63

A specific flag and we all know which one I am talking about. To try the tactic of deflection on the official name of the flag is a bit disingenuous. IE you know what I am talking about. I am not calling for the Feds to do anything here. I simply believe that we white southerners should stop placing so much false passion over this flag and should read this as voluntarily seek to remove it from official life. Your assumption that I meant federal intervention is wrong. I am simply using persuasion. It is just a flag. I couldnt agree more. It is a flag that has powerful imagery. Literally millions have died in history under flags of one sort or another. This flag is no different. It is a mere piece of cloth that has powerful politics behind it.

Congress STILL needs to revote on the TAA which hopefully wont pass. The president has stated he will not sign TPA without TAA. Either way despite the moral objections there is nothing unconstitutional about Congress authorizing TPA. I understand that we are all extremely skeptical of the TPP but that doesnt make it wrong for Congress to establish there own rules of procedure. All congress is doing is giving up its power to add amendments to treatiestrade agreements which would essentially kill them in their path. It has done it six times in the past.

4505658,0,t3_3cs1b2,Im going to talk about Rands plan.   There are less progressive ways to implement it but i thinkhefounda good balance.   First and foremost it alleviates employment tax. Employment tax is the most regressive tax imaginable. It starts at over  on the first penny earned and you only have to pay it on the first k or so you earn.  So literally a poor tax. You know it as social security and Medicare. Rands flat tax will not tax anything earned below kyearhousehold so people who live in poverty will go from  taxes to none. At all.   Id certainly advocate that we stop taking money from the poor as a first step before we even talk about minimum wage or food stamps. On the other end of the spectrum is the rich. Peak tax rates appear to be paid by the upper middle in the k income ranges. They still pay a lot of employment taxes their income makes it into the higher brackets but isnt high enough to play games to make the income tough to tax. The rich in the other hand only pay  due to numerous loopholes. Thats a lower percentage than many Americans. And every time democrats raise taxes on the rich they tend to just move the income brackets around and hit the upper middleleaving their big wig sponsors unmolested. The simplicity of a flat tax makes it much harder to avoid. Sure as you went far past the k tax free exemption you would see that the ultra rich are barely taxed more than the rich. But it is simple. Its hard to avoid. Its simplicity will neuter the IRS ability to use audits as political punishment. For what its worth Gary Johnson has a flat sales tax plan that is even more favorable to the poor. Each household is sent a prebate each month as a sort of very reduced basic income which covers the sales tax on poverty level spending not enough to live off mind you that means if you spend below poverty you receive money from the Government each month at poverty you break even and you start paying taxes as your spending surpasses poverty spending. Otherwise the advantages are similar.ANYONE who says these tax plans hurt the poor has clearly not read them and analyzed what would actually happen to people living in poverty. They are probably just giving knee jerk reaction to libertarians hate poor or something. ,Libertarian,csyl7be,2,t5_2qh63

4627410,0,t1_ctdt1sn,gtAll I was really trying to get at is basically that it makes sense for libertarians who oppose abortion to be extra annoyed at government funding of planned parenthood. I dont think that you can discredit MuzakNinja for caring about this particular issue. I agree with him that people who find abortion objectionable should not be forced to fund it. And people who find military expenditures objectionabkle shouldnt be forced to fund that either. One of the evils of the state is that it steals from people to fund controversial and objectionable services.I dont think I understand what you mean by discredit in this context but I agree with these things that you said.gt Whether this is true or not is almost irrelevant. Of course religiousconservative libertarians will fight against government funding of planned parenthood with perhaps more vigor than other government expenditures. This makes sense though. We all have our own beliefs and focuses is it wrong for me to be extra opposed to government military funding because of my antiwar beliefs?gtAs libertarians we all want to defund most programs. People will have priorities or preferences. We all find it objectionable that the state practices so much theft against the populace and most libertarians agree that taxpayers should have the liberty to withhold their money from morally controversial state expendituresI agree that people have priorities but conservative libertarians priorities typically dont include actual liberty they mostly include pushing a conservative agenda by parroting libertarian lines without actually believing in them. You do have rare exceptions Ron Paul and maybe his son jury is out on how much Rand will sacrifice to become president is the most notable modern exception but hes not entirely unique. But most conservative libertarians dont just have a couple of odd little hiccoughs of cognitive dissonance they are just using libertarian language to push an agenda which only looks libertarian if you ignore all the ways it isnt. It is difficult for me to understand how the abortion issue can be a priority for any libertarian opposed to on moral grounds. Even if youre opposed to it on moral grounds the question of how to stop it cant possibly involve the state if youre actually a libertarian. And even if somehow you construct a way in which the government should be involving itself in decisions made between a doctor and his patient it is still utterly unthinkable that this is a bigger priority than foreign policy or the war on drugs both of which are directly responsible for daily real suffering of human beings that everyone agrees are human beings. How can your need to interfere with the lives of human beings be more important than the need to end government atrocities?The answer is simple it cant be. The only way it can be is if you dont really see those other things as atrocities. And thats what most of the libertarian wing of the GOP is all about they dont really want to get government out of our lives they want to get government acting as an efficient state for promoting business and family values. The only priority of theirs which is even remotely legitimate is entitlement reform and that issue which is a priority of the libertarian wing of the GOP is the one that allows them to pretend to be libertarians successfully enough to convince a lot of people that there is a real libertarian wing within the GOP. But in reality they dont want a libertarian solution they want once again an instrument of mercantilism to make the state a facilitator of economic growth. Social security would be replaced by mandatory investment and management of such accounts would certainly not even be selfdriven. In any case Ive gone off on a tangent I see so Im going to wrap this up theres nothing wrong with priorities but sometimes there are patterns which emerge that make it abundantly clear that most people who have certain priorities are largely not people who actually believe in freedom.,Libertarian,ctduum6,2,t5_2qh63

4695392,0,t1_ctmdecr,Until the s the Great Society in particular poverty was declining about  per year in the black community and about  of families could be labeled as singleparent broken homes. Since then there has been a slight increase in poverty squandering decades of potential progress and trillions of dollars and over  of families are broken homes. Crime rates got worse as well and the welfare rolls amongst blacks have exploded since the s. The leftist outpouring of other peoples money into innercity schools public housing initiatives and the labor laws are the brick and mortar of the bleak ghettos many blacks must endure today.What Im saying is the way forward is not hold individuals blameless for their crimes against others simply because you imagine they have been generally oppressed for their skin color. Thats what I mean by granting them the same moral agency you would anyone else. I am also saying that a culture whose value system has largely been eroded by moral busybodies trying to help them has turned violent due to the inevitable poverty that such help has afforded them. Do you understand that? Before the Left decided to be so magnanimous there were far fewer symptoms of cultural decay and things were getting better. ,Libertarian,ctme83s,1,t5_2qh63
4695597,0,t3_3f81x7,I think there is a great deal of common ground on many social issues between liberals and libertarians. I also think it would be a disservice to those issues and those most significantly impacted by those issues to prevent coalitions due to other differences we may have on other issues.That being said there are clearly some areas on which we may simply have to agree to disagree. Not because of a lack of concern for the poor or any procorporate mentality but because for most libertarians the useinitiation of violence is the paramount characteristic to be aware of. So welfare programs that use the threat of forceviolence to tax some to give money to others directly conflicts with that characteristic. There are also problems with the incentives created by welfare programs as well as the inefficiency waste fraud and abuse. But since you wanted to avoid economic aspects well avoid going into that.Some libertarians are more comfortable with bending on that. Some thick libertarians or bleeding heart libertarians can justify support for some welfare programs. From a pragmatic perspective there are many libertarians who have voiced a willingness to consider a negative income tax or a universal basic income as an approach to fix our current welfare state  that is if such a safety net were to replace all other welfare programs in place. Either way most libertarians Ive heard view welfare programs as one of the last things theyd look to fix should libertarians ever gain power. It would be a topic libertarians would likely only attempt to address well after more immediate issues like militaristic foreign policy the war on drugs police militarization immigration as well as things like various corporatist policies like subsidies exclusive use rights intellectual property tax creditsloopholes etc. Once all of the big business advantages were removed and govt was no longer taking  of even the average middle class individuals income then wed look at how we can slowly attempt to reform welfare programs. Basically those people who condemn libertarian politicians because we hate poor people and would destroy welfare programs are usually just fearmongering to scare voters away.Again I think theres a lot of room for cooperation against some nearly universally reviled behavior on the part of modern govts. It would be a shame to see that cooperation fail to happen because we disagree on other things.,Libertarian,ctmf5kn,1,t5_2qh63

All the data shows is that they frisked those minorities more than their general percentage of the population.  Just like drug arrests and cop killings it is relevant how many of those minorities the police interact with.  Specifically for long accept reason police walk the beat of neighborhoods with higher crime rates more than those those with low rates.  As such police encounter those minorities more often than their percentage of the total population.  It thus follows that an unbiased implementation of stop and frisk would stop more of those minorities.  A biased one would make race relevant to who they stop so that they can artificially increase the number of whites they stop by seeking them out in other neighborhoods.gt Then arrested them for having marijuana visible in public.Your leftist saint Bloomberg made some foolish zero tolerance push.

Weve had wider temperature fluctuations than this historically and itd be foolish to note the world is the same. Im not disputing that humans are influencing the climate its just a question of how much and to what ends.gtCapitalism seems based off an ever increasing consumption. With a consumption based economic system and growing population it seems like the free market is an infinite demand on finite resources.Youre confusing growth in economic value with growth in quantity of consumption. One thing capitalism encourages is to do more with less and to eliminate waste. The company that is able to produce the same good while consuming half of the resources is going to be economically superior and grow in value comparatively to competitors assuming they are doing so at a cost effective measure. gtSimply saying the free market will take care of it doesnt suffice in regards to the Environment. Most libertarians believe that you dont have a right to pollute the environment as it is a form of force against another. If you can show and measure the harm done to someone I dont think its out of line to restrict the actions of someone or to place a finetax for that harm. However I think it is a better option to pursue positive influences for change rather than coercion. We could place carbon out limits or tax people for the amount of pollution the commit. However there are so many government handouts to insulate current oil and coal companies and artificial barriers in place to prevent the development of things like superior nuclear technology that it should be the priority to remove those first. Once you stop subsidizing the current system and let the market work then you can determine if force to rectify damages is necessary. Right now its like people that want to tax soda to discourage soda usage while we subsidize corn so much that soda is so cheap to begin with. If wed just cut the corn subsidies soda would rise on its own. So would the price of oil if we stopped subsidizing it and then people would look more to alternatives.,Libertarian,cu1vj6k,7,t5_2qh63

Yes that is a form of state force however I would argue that it is one of the most legitimate uses of state force.  Legally binding and enforceable contracts are one of the very basic building blocks of any modern economy. gt A homeowner could demand you agree to never sell to or allow a minority to live in a residence. If that homeowner finds out youre engaged to a member of that minority prior to the final sales agreement they can withdraw from the sale. If they find out seconds after it is complete they cannot unwind or cancel the sale. In that particular case the seller would at least have an argument to set aside the sale due to fraud.   gt This covers all HOA powers from not letting you paint houses yellow to not letting you have a tree house.So are you saying that if someone were to sell their house on terms not subject to the HOA then the buyer wouldnt be subject to the HOA? I suppose that situation would be possible however the HOA would have a strong claim against the seller for breach of contract.But Im not sure why exactly this is relevant.  I concede that it is possible to breach a contract.  However legally speaking once you enter into a contract you are bound by its terms.gt Barring State force there is no penalty your employer may engage in other than not working with you.Sure contracts are enforced in court.  Do you have a problem with that?  Im not sure when this turned into a discussion about anarchism...gt There is no right to jury. Thats a State provided privilege and yes you most certainly can waive your privileges.Woah so how exactly are you drawing this rightprivilege distinction?  Is free speech also a privilege?  Protections against selfincrimination? Freedom from unreasonable searches?gt Again an exchange of value. But just because you purchased my inaction does not mean that the person I sold to is also required not to actSure they wouldnt be absent an agreement with the next buyer.  However if A sells to B with the express term that B will only sell the property under x y and z conditions then B is bound by the contract he signed.  That means that B would be in breach of contract if he sells to C without x y and z conditions.  You seem to be suggesting that an agreement to only sell under x y and z conditions is somehow legally impermissible or unenforceable.  But thats flatly incorrect.  You can buy property subject to conditions just like you can buy anything subject to conditions.  gt Absolute unrecoverable wrong.No actually Im  correct on this point.  Contracts can contain terms for their own modification and those terms can require something less than unanimous consent of the parties.  gt Youre probably confusing a change of terms of service as a contract change. Those are actually entirely new contracts which you agree to by continuing to use a service. Reserve the right to change these terms of service at any time is nothing more than holding the right to terminate the existing contract and offer a new one.No I think youre the one thats confused here.  Now its true that the vast majority of contracts contain a provision that says something like modifications may only be made by mutual consent of all parties.However that is not legally required.  You could enter into a  party contract that says changes may be made with consent of  out of  parties.  You could enter into a contract that says changes may be made at the sole discretion of my friend Bob or whatever other terms you see fit.  I believe that people have freedom to contract under the terms they see fit even if I happen to believe those terms are unwise or unfair.

They arent identical beings that react the same way and not all people act rationally using the conventional definition not the Misesian definition all the time. Misesian praxeology most definitely assumes that all people are homogeneous examples of homo economicus. gtYou mean that they make wild assumptions perfect competition for one example that have no base in reality I dont know of anyone outside of an intro microeconomics course who actually uses perfect competition in the way that Austrians allege other economists to use it so thats a strawman. Strawmen arent really too foreign of a concept to the praxeological Austrians anyway. gtthen use measure statistics that have well over one million variables to confirm their bias?What most economists do is take measurements and then create a model to describe the world based on what theyve found. Not all models are perfect.Edit Also its really not even necessary to look at all variables for a model. Some dont make a difference in the model others arent being tested. Including Really Big Numbers to be scary is just reactionary and a symptom of antiintellectualism.Which isnt so much different than what Austrians do but instead of using inductive reasoning to model the world around them Austrians use deductive reasoning.Models arent actually alien to Austrian economics even classical Austrian economics Mises etc. The economic calculation problem is a model. Mises evenly rotating economy is a model. Etc.The only difference in the area of economic models is that mainstream economists dont pretend they arent using models when they are using models.In fact its really ironic that Austrians point to increasing money supply and then decide that there will be hyperinflation or really comment on any contemporary economic phenomena while at the same time saying that inductive reasoning cannot prove or disprove a theory because they are contradicting their deductive approach reasoning from axiom by including real world data the money supply unemployment etc. You either use deductive reasoning to prove your case as unfalsifiable or you use data to make your case but you cant do both.,Libertarian,cu5wvmb,1,t5_2qh63

4989347,0,t1_cuncjyc,I think the core of our disagreement is how we are defining letting them keep the money. Living isnt cheap and the rich tend to live even more lavishly and a lucky rich person without a source of income will lose a fortune without the government doing anything through spending. And the fortune will be split between the people who cook his food design and construct his cars and house and what not. Hard workers who I think people of all political persuasions agree should get it. A rich person who stays rich still needs a source of income. That means they have to contribute to society in a way that people continue voluntarily giving them money. Are there rich Americans who had rich slave owning ancestors or wealth stemming from European nobility? Without a doubt. But there are countless more poor Americans who can also trace a portion of their family to rich folks who squandered it. So to answer your question  aside from property rights why do the rich deserve to keep their money? Because the two options given to them are  gradually give their money to the hard workers allowing them to maintain their life style.  find a way to contribute to the economy that helps everyone in the USA.My question to you is why do you think you and the government have the rights to take money from someone based on how much they aquired?

Counties are mostly organized and receive funding from the state to create health departments transportation departments etc. Cities on the other hand are basically free to do whatever they want with limited mandates from the state. The state mostly lays guidelines and gets involved if the cities stray from those guidelines such as not having balanced budgets corruption etc. This is a demonstration of that. Since she is a county clerk she is mandated by state law to issue marriage license. The law says that the county clerk shall issue when people who write laws want something to be optional they use may issue marriage license. Those licenses are regulated and controlled by Kentucky and administered by he county. As opposed to something like a building permit that might be issued at the city level where the state may have laws in place that only outline guidelines for the cities in regards to building permits.

5281294,0,t1_cvmkhz7,gt By all means dont bother to explain the position.Im not about to into a  page explanation on the outset. If youre confused about something youre welcome to inquire. It appears you focussed on The NAP. Its simple The NAP is anything but the NonAggression Principle. It is the arbitrary justification of establishment aggression. Its moving the line of what counts as aggression its not the NonAggression Principle. Lets put it a bit more into perspective Referring to The NAP by its colloquially acceptable terminology would be like accepting that a vegan can eat meat but only meat that was caught in the wild. Well okay I guess I can see how you could reach that conclusion but it kind of misses the point entirely and you should not be calling yourself a vegan if youre eating meat. Call yourself something else. Further inside The NAP is the backwards because it is reliant upon selfownership being the establishment for proper ownership. You own yourself and your labor therefore what you labor to produce you rightfully own. It makes sense just so long as you do not think about it. This is using two completely different standards of ownership which individually have nothing in common with each other yet implying that one begets the other. This is logically inconsistent. If we are to accept ownership as applies our selves then our selves truly is the only thing we could possible own. If we accept proper ownership then our selves no longer apply from the outset. None of the aspects of ownership apply to our selvesgtTo acquire property one can purchase it with money trade it for other property win it in a bet receive it as a gift inherit it find it receive it as damages earn it by doing work or performing services make it or homestead it. One can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money exchanging it for other property giving it as a gift misplacing it or having it stripped from ones ownership through legal means such as eviction foreclosure seizure or taking.You cannot sell your self even if you did into slavery or prostitution under the concept of selfownership you still own your self therefore you never really sold your self you cannot trade your self cannot be given as a gift you cannot exchange your self nor can you be misplaced you cannot have your self be stripped of ownership from yourself you cannot be foreclosed you cannot be seized from ownership of your self... So on and so forth. Therefore any concept that relies on selfownership in that context is internally inconsistent from the outset. It no longer matters what conclusions one may reach after that point as they will equally be flawed. I tried to slim this down as much as I could and this was just focussing on The NAP.

5302976,0,t3_3ni0mz,Hong Kongs economic policy has often been cited by economists such as Milton Friedman and the Cato Institute as an example of laissezfaire capitalism attributing the citys success to the policy. However others have argued that the economic strategy is not adequately characterised by the term laissezfaire. They point out that there are still many ways in which the government is involved in the economy some of which exceed the degree of involvement in other capitalist countries. For example the government has intervened to create economic institutions such as the Hong Kong Stock Market and is involved in public works projects healthcare education and social welfare spending. Further although rates of taxation on personal and corporate income are low by international standards unlike most other countries Hong Kongs government raises a significant portion of its revenues from land leases and land taxation. All land in Hong Kong is owned by the government and is leased to private developers and users on fixed terms for fees which are paid to the state treasury. By restricting the sale of land leases the Hong Kong government keeps the price of land at what some consider as artificially high prices and this allows the government to support relatively high public spending with a low tax rate on income and profit.Hong Kong the libertarian paradise.,Libertarian,cvpimla,2,t5_2qh63

Thats the idea of libertarianism reduction of the size and scope of government authority. Creating a department to track local PDs doesnt fit in the U.S. Constitution and really barely fits inside the idea of libertarianism except at a very local level.

I cant imagine a US where the states have more power than the FED. simply because of issues like this. How does a small federal government deal with states that say no this is how we are meant to be screw off? What ability is there to enforce the law?  it is not the same as it is now. My license from state X gives me the right to drive in the united states. I require no more fines or payments to other states to use their roads even though my taxes fund some other states road repairs.

Its logically inconsistent to pick and choose how you apply your rights as arbitrary as they are. gtFree speechOpen speech is just as important to the listener as it is to the person saying the words.That ignores the point.The right to free speech does not mean you get to say whatever you want without social repercussions. Social repercussions are not part of free speech at all. I should have the right to say that the fat girl at work is fat because shes a slob and takes no care of her health. However that does not mean that I will get to escape the affect that will have on my relationship with the rest of my coworkers creating a hostile work environment in which I am the lone outsider.The other half of free speech is that when you are spouting all kinds of racist sexist homophobic bullshit I get to call you out on your bullshit I get to kick you the fuck out of my house I get to tell you that youre no longer welcome in my social circle. That is also free speech. What I do not get to do is call the police and have them arrest you for being a racist sexist or homophobic asshole.Theres a huge difference. If youre so worried about your viewpoints being constantly censored in private no matter where you go then thats evidence that its you. Thats your problem. Take some responsibility for yourself and your own actions.It amazes me how heavy the double standards are on this subject with you people. When it comes to this mythical subject of Free Speech all of the sudden you no longer believe in  Private Property Rights  Sovereignty of the individual  Personal responsibility personal accountability  The actual Right to Free Speech  Ideals of the Free Market  Hypocrites. ,Libertarian,cwcwvyp,-2,t5_2qh63

And yet fortyfive years later with five recessions a grassroots rebellion against government intrusion and corporate largess  of the population identifying as socially liberal fiscally conservative and over  people casting votes for Ron Paul and Gary Johnson for some reason theres still no voting base to get so much as one  just one  Libertarian elected to something more glamorous than Municipal Dog Catcher? You cant seriously believe that.Yes naturally building an informed coalition is what all strong successful political parties do. Without voter education winning is nigh impossible at any level. But dont conflate electoral accomplishment with a lack of voter education. Successful political parties understand that growing ones base through outreach efforts represents only half of the equation the Libertarian Party and the Greens Constitutionalists Socialists et. al does not. The other half of getting elected is statistical analysis resource allocation and logistics. Its branding its advertising its strategy. Tell me what you think is it good strategy to run a national campaign that deliberately aligns your party with the far right more than the far left which only weakens your prospects in a firstpastthepost electoral system? Is it good strategy to waste millions of dollars mounting a presidential campaign for a candidate who likely has zero name recognition rather than funneling that money into five or six smaller statewide elections that give you the best chances of winning?No sane person I know would say so. And yet this has been exactly the Libertarian modus operandi since its inception. Why? Have they not yet realized the problem isnt one of education but one of coordination?Well actually they have. In  the Libertarian Reform Caucus was formed to address this issue. I knew several members of the LRC and despite not being a delegate to the Portland Convention myself supported their cause. Sadly what changes they were able to make eventually got overturned in  and  and they eventually disbanded driven out by party radicals who saw their changes to the party platform and national committee as sacrilege. Predictably for a party that likes to throw shade on the idea of politics as usual as well as the messy complications of you know governing implying that voter education wasnt the beall endall that the radicals thought it was or that the Libertarian Party needed to adopt a mainstream approach didnt go over well.The radicals  the Raimondos the Konkins the Keatons  would love it if you accepted the myth that the LP simply needs more and more voter education. That is how they have always prevented the Libertarian Party from achieving any notable success. But in fairness theyre not the only minor political party that thinks this way. All of them do.

There is debate now on whether they are still actively targeting children or if it is just a byproduct of a crossover between what adults like and what children like.Here is a long research article that talks all about the direct marketing to youth as well as these cross over marketing with evidence that though some of it is intended for adults it has a greater affect on youth.  It also has links to cases where courts have ruled the companies targeted kids andor knew their advertisements were targeting more teens.  Also links to the passed laws making it illegal to target teens and when the companies have gotten in trouble for violating the law.  linkI do agree that cross over shouldnt mean you cannot advertise.

5565777,0,t1_cwmy9or,I agree labor volume will never exceed all useful employment.  But that isnt what broken window illustrates.  The whole point of the example is to illustrate how labor time and resources can be wasted.  There is no net add the economy despite real work being done.  If anything there is a net decrease despite what the metrics may show.  The example may prop up employment figures velocity of money GDP etc but there was really no good or service produced that leads to a different outcome from simply doing nothing.  We may have just as well left the window unbroken.  Those tanks if they are truly never used which I dont think they will be. maybe Im wrong will just end up being scrapped for metal.  When that happens it will instantly complete the broken window cycle.  Other examples would include giving Toyota trucks to Isis members.  We are literally spending labor to help our enemy.  Im sure there are hundreds of such examples.  The fast and furious program is the next immediate example that comes to mind.  It happens on both sides.  Im sure the phrase a bridge to nowhere rings a bell with you.If you can corral all that wasted labor into producing needed goods such as oil food energy etc you would increase accessibility to those goods in proportion to how the supply increases.  That would be beneficial to all especially the poor.  Taxing more just to spend more with no real aim on what were producing is just busy work.

Fraud is a violation of the NAP in that telling me that your product does X but in reality it does Y and refusing to provide me with X after Ive purchased your product is theft. There is no libertarian basis for permitting theft and thus no basis for condoning fraud.If Exxon is responsible for carbon emissions and Exxon knew a long time ago that their products were damaging to the environment and then Exxon paid scientists to claim the opposite then the scientists and Exxon are engaged in fraud which is theft which is aggression.Liability for damages including environmental damages is essential to libertarianism.

Business fraud protects the individual who is being lied to from spending capital in a way that would result in an unequal transaction unequal by the reckoning that it was not really a consensual transaction as both parties were not fully informed or had no way to be fully informed of what they were purchasing. However I am not very well educated as to the specifics of antifraud laws and with your assent i would like to shy away from that. However your example of billionaire vs politician I think is very important. You call the libertarian distinctions between the two to not actually amount to anything when I cannot disagree more. A politician in a democratic republic such as ours assuming of course you are a United States resident is a reflection of their constituency and a politician straying from the wishes of their electing constituency is a dangerous precedent. A billionaire however is a private citizen acting in his own interests and values and he merely possesses a much larger amount of capital than the average person. He is well within his rights to to what you described and he may or may not suffer for that business practice whether economically or socially. The billionaire also has no power to pass legislation to prevent people from acting of their own interests like the politician can he cannot do it directly I am not arguing against the existence of cronyism. ,Libertarian,cxiomln,1,t5_2qh63

5880004,0,t1_cxopkap,gtdeep rooted cultural problems.Yes youre exactly right.  There are deep rooted cultural problems but youre missing the forest for the trees.  Nearly all violent crime in the nation is perpetrated by individuals in just a few counties.  Places like Compton Harlem Flint Furgeson Detroit and Atlanta are the problem.  There isnt a gun problem in America as traditional white american families have incredibly low levels of violence comparatively.  There are more than  million whites in America but FBI table  indicates that they commit a disproportionally low amount of violent crime.  You tout other countrys lack of violence but in my state where there is an abundance of gun culture a disproportionate amount of violence occurs in only a tiny handful of places.  Ill leave it to you to guess the socioeconomic and racial makeup of those places compared to the rest of the state.  You dont see violence in North Dakota Utah and Montana for the same reason though Id hazard to guess that they are the places where firearms are most ubiquitous and nearly everyone has access to weaponry.  Violent crime follows clear and established trends and until we start to recognise and act on those trends our country will remain the laughing stock of the developed world.

Demand is up and since its less subsidized than other industries it has gone up in costs less. It is literally the opposite of cherry picking. If you look at the chart I provided you can clearly see that industries that went up in cost are subsidized industries that arent went down in cost. Also if you look at specific funding increasing you can see a direct correlation with price increases. Devry ITT etc. exist because of crony capitalism. They dont exist because the market demands them they exist because people can get student loans and subsidized tuition for them. Lastly consumers are stupid.

6083684,1,t1_cyh10fk,gt Interesting that the NSA while spying on these citizens hasnt brought a trial against any of them ever.Thats because the NSA isnt a law enforcement agency. Only the FBI is stupid enough to believe it can both conduct domestic surveillance and refer charges to prosecutors in keeping with constitutional protections.gt Almost like they know that a FISA warrant would get thrown out in A Court of Law faster than  week old sushi.Because FISA courts arent for convicting or trying or even indicting. Theyre for issuing warrants. Every jurisdiction in the US has a judge or magistrate that issues warrants but doesnt actually preside over a court.gt Additionally a list of FISA city warrant was leaked recently. I noticed a distinct lack of Congressmen on that list.Do you actually think the entire history of FISA warrants was leaked? Even for a single municipality? gt Furthermore given the NSAs propensity to lie to the US and Congress specifically it no longer gets the benefit of a doubt.Who needs the benefit of the doubt? The NSA isnt attempting to put people in prison. It isnt attempting to kick down doors. It isnt attempting to raid homes. Its there to observe and report.The real issue at hand is whether or not you think parallel construction is a viable legal strategy. To illustrate exactly what Im talking about heres a scenario The NSA doesnt have the authority to arrest indict or prosecute...but it DOES have the ability to conduct surveillance. It finds out that Mark is laundering money to John through Joan for the purchase of weapons to be used against the US. Mark and John are foreign nationals but Joan is an American.  The NSA knows that Joan is complicit but cannot release evidence against her because that evidence is inadmissible in court. Even if the evidence were admissible in court the NSA would have to submit its collection procedures to the discovery process potentially compromising their future use. The NSA has no interest in ever releasing this information because it would result in the exoneration of someone they now know is committing a crime and it would potentially compromise their methods. So the NSA calls the FBI. It refuses to give details about how but tips off the FBI that they should look into Joan for moneylaundering between Mark and John. The NSA is adamant about not giving the FBI enough information to solve the crime and that the FBI should pursue this case but theyll have to do the detective work themselves. The FBI continues to monitor Joan and gathers evidence based on the tip they received. The tip was enough to warrant reasonable suspicion but not enough for probable cause to indict. The evidence crosses the threshold into probable cause and the FBI now has access to warrants to gather more detailed evidence for a court. Without any material evidence from the NSA the FBI manages to build its own case inside constitutional parameters against Joan and can convict. It got this evidence by catching Joan in the act or by using publicly available information it wouldnt have otherwise searched for.This is parallel construction. If you see the NSAs tip as not much different from an anonymous concerned citizen tip then you have no legal basis to object. If you believe the NSA is using its authority to continue collecting evidence to share with the FBI after a warrant was issued then this is objectionable as it is now taking advantage of holes in the th Amendment to use in court. If you think the FBIs case is wholly derived from NSA evidence then you see even graver problems. More than anything this illustrates why intelligence collection and the legal system must be prevented from sharing information in investigations.,Libertarian,cyh1vr8,0,t5_2qh63

Just reading the Wikipedia entry on the NAP is informative  Aggression for the purposes of NAP is defined as initiating or threatening the use of violence against a person or legitimately owned property of another.  Pollution is both a trespass and a nuisance.  In modern law the word trespass is used most commonly to describe the intentional and wrongful invasion of anothers real property. The action can be maintained against anyone who interferes with the right of ownership or possession whether the invasion is by a person or by something that a person has set in motion e.g. pollution.  Dumping a pollutant into water or air which flows onto anothers property is an actionable trespass and a nuisance except where the government has become involved in a regulatory capacity and displaced individual property rights with some other potentially less stringent standard.

He was compared to Huey Long and to Joseph Stalin and to Che Guevara.Plenty of Americans viewed MLKs march to Selma as having terrible negative consequences even leaders within the NAACP.

The affidavit of Aguilera for the search warrant claimed that there were over  weapons in the compound. The paperwork on the AR components cited in the affidavit showed that they were in fact legal semiautomatics however Aguilera told the judge I have been involved in many cases where defendants following a relatively simple process convert AR semiautomatic rifles to fully automatic rifles of the nature of the M. Aguilera stated in the affidavit and later testified at trial that a neighbor had heard machine gun fire however Aguilera failed to tell the magistrate that the same neighbor had previously reported the noise to the local Waco sheriff who investigated the neighbors complaint. Paul Fatta who was also involved in the failed takeover of the group in  told The New York Times that Koresh and he had visited the sheriff after the surveillance had been spotted and claimed that the sheriffs office told them their guns were legal.Notice that the judge signed the search warrant because the Davidians were buying legal guns that like most objects in the world can be modified from their original form and one person with an axe to grind said he heard automatic fire from the compound.I dont care what other illegalimmoral things the group did thats not what the warrant was for and thats not what caught the ATFs attention.

Because those are two completely different things under a gold standard.Under a gold standard your money goes up in value simply by doing nothing.

Marxists were the ones to have adopted the term Socialism almost exclusively for themselves as they believed to be the One True Scientifically Proven Socialist ideology.Read for example Bastiats The Law and youll get a taste of what socialists were back then. Also Social Democrat ideals have drifted over times and now incorporate quite a bit of Fascist  State Syndicalist ideas.So if he still believes in private ownership he probably is more like a classic Socialist Democrat and if he wants more Union control with heavy State regulation of that hes more Corporatist leaning probably hes somewhere in between those as most Social Democrats are these days in places like Europe.Edit autocorrect be damned lol,Libertarian,czg5qjy,1,t5_2qh63

Hell did you know that SF pays the homeless to live in Alameda? they pay the rent. And Alameda pays for homeless to live out near pleasnat hill. Each city houses the homeless in a cheaper area slightly farther away from the city.

That means we end up with a worthless currency and no jobs.

If you dont understand that the WASPs who are in positions of political and economic power are only there because their ancestors happened to be in the place where some other WASP with even more political and economic power could give them unfair access to natural resources.

For instance anyone could hire another person for security around their business. Govt says We can do that but we will protect all buildings. Never mind the effectiveness of one or the other.  Matters of efficiency are rarely brought up and are honestly besides to point when creating govt.  Its just a dales pitch.  Well take your tax dollars and provide security for all. Unlike a business youre now no longer allowed to discontinue the service should it be performed badly or not at all.  But you still pay for the ideaconcept of the police.  I hope at this point you realize sometimes govt police works and sometimes it doesnt.  Its simply social convention to praise the idea and talk about good policing or bad policing.

It would also be trivial to take those batchassembled burgers and quickly sort them into individual orders based on what the customer actually ordered.  Hell if the throughput was required you could build a system that could simultaneously cook  or  for that matter burger patties then transfer those patties all at once or in batches to a massive burger assembly system and rapidly apply or not apply every one of Znumber of condimentsgarnishes in parallel.  I once licensed a system that could process hundreds of tons of broken glass per hour into its constituent colors clear green brown  whizzing each piece of broken glass past a camera on a conveyor flinging each piece into the air and using timed puffs of compressed air to blow the shard left right or let it continue to enable it to be deposited into the correct bin.In another project I licensed a automated system that observed a living rat in a clear cage   hrs a day  and detected scored and recorded every single one of  different rat behaviors.

Either an employee can bind an employer with a contract or he cant.gt You are saying that a group of present employees and their employer should be allowed to make a contract which prevents the employer from hiring anyone else except on the same terms given to the union.Indeed.  Such exclusive contracts occur between parties with regularity throughout the business world.gt This theory is usually predicated on the notion that such contracts are anticompetitive and impede the smooth workings of a free labor market.Dictating how other people contract would also be a violation of free labor markets.  If youre proposing regulation of contracts between parties then youre endorsing a centrally managed economy through the state not an anticompetitive free market.gt But no a future hire in violation of the contract doesnt necessarily dissolve the contract.Why would anyone participate in a contract if each participant assumed the other could violate the terms without repercussion?  What is the purpose of a contract in this case?gt  Assuming a court upholds the future hire the contract wont be declared totally null and voidSo the employees would still be bound to uphold their end of the contract but the employer would be released from upholding his end of the contract?

7242828,0,t3_4empa2,Purely an offthecuff thought here  Im suspicious of antitrust regulations but theoretically could see a use for them.I believe that free markets are more powerful then most people believe.  We think that Rockefeller owned the world with Standard Oil but we forget two parts of the story  the first is that his technology made fuel quality more consistent and safer thus the branding Standard.  The second is that the monopolydriven higher prices for fuel basically made electricity a standard for lighting and other uses in the home.  The free market found the opportunity provided by the exploitation of the monopoly automatically limiting its power.Another example was the internet browser wars.  Looking back it might have been needless to prosecute Microsoft over the issue of Internet Explorer.  Although Microsoft killed off Netscape Navigator I doubt it would have kept an overwhelming market share over free alternatives like Chrome or open source alternatives like Firefox.  Left to its own devices there was a high likelihood that the free market would have created alternatives to take advantage of any exploitation by the monopoly.And this doesnt count monopolies are those created by the government.  For example high regulatory requirements that create barriers to entry which prevent smaller businesses from competing with larger ones.  Health care is another example where laws preventing the outofstate purchase of health insurance artificially lower competition while required coverage amounts drive up the profit margins.,Libertarian,d21ggmc,3,t5_2qh63

7373012,0,t3_4ga6do,Heres the way I see it. The difference between left and right libertarianism turns on the issue of private property and how far it extends. A leftist anarchist would say you dont own anything but basically the clothes on your back. This is tantamount to saying we should go back to huntergatherers. You cant have industry let alone agriculture without some form of property. I consider various forms of mutualismsyndicalismvoluntarism to either be veiled forms of state socialism or naive pipe dreams. Either theres once again no concept of property or collective property to the exclusion of private property which is socialism. A Georgist or a geolibertarian would say you own anything you put effort into creating but resources that you didnt create are a public good and should be treated as such. This I find is an elegant solution between successfully utilizing private property and curbing rentseeking behavior. You still own your crops and you still retain right of use of your land so long as you pay your renttax on the land itself. A normal right libertarian would argue that almost all forms of private property are kosher including land and natural resources including unextracted resources. And an extreme right example would be the slave owning planters of the South who viewed owning people as a natural property right and didnt believe the government had the right to interfere with said property. TLDR leftlibertarianism is either halfbaked a contradiction in terms or Georgism which is made of win.,Libertarian,d2g9dyr,3,t5_2qh63

Depending on where you define the starting point it may be long overdue.gt To even compare that to some shitty bakery not wanting to customize a cake but still willing to sell one is so absurd its offensive.I was referring to a bakery that refuses to do any business with homosexuals whatsoever not just one that restricts the services they provide. But more broadly its relevant to any type of business  could be a bar a grocery store something less trivial than a bakery. My point is if youre going to have nondiscrimination law any type of discrimination that would be prohibited on the basis of race should also be prohibited on the basis of sexual orientation.

I welcome all Republicans to vote for our eventual nominee but they should not get to pick our nominee for us. We will never grow into a major party with only angry Republicans. We need the angry Democrats as well. A JohnsonPetersen ticket isnt a bad idea. Johnson at the top of the ticket touting his experience and more moderate views that is likely to attract independents and a few liberals and Petersen along for the ride picking up Republicans.

7617142,1,t1_d37yd6k,So the current legal basis for RvW is viability.  ProLifers typically want to stop abortions at the moment of conception. Therein lies the rub.   In a fully individualist libertarian sense  a fetus would have rights only insofar as they are selfcontained.  You have no right to my body and I none to yours.  It is a womans right to provide or notprovide womb services. So long as the fetus is not prevented from leaving the womb and not damaged in and of itself its rights are not violated.  It does not have rights to the womans nutrients to the blood or the very space of the womb without imposing on the womans selfdetermination.  Personal rights by their very intrinsic nature DO NOT demand that I care for my neighbor fetus or otherwise.  It is ultimately my free choice to help or not help.Which means... if youre going to look at the hyperrational libertarian personalrights view of abortion you end up in a scenario where a woman can remove the fetus in anyway she deems fit provided that the fetus is not damaged or hurt and allowed to attempt viability on its own.  So abortions are legal... but suddenly the become much more protracted and gruesome for both entities.  Ultimately a ltweeks fetus will likely die until we have some awesome futuristic artificial wombs.  But hey their rights have not been violated.  The mother and child separated on fair terms.  Each was allowed to survive by its own account.TLDR Sorry...

7696678,0,t3_4kppqv,gt What is a libretarians opinion on the poor? Is it a problem or not?Do you guys care about reversing this predicament even if not through government or do you think that it is something inevitable.It is more or less inevitable but when the government tries to help they only make it worse. Take minimum wage laws for example. Companies cant pull money out of thin air so when faced with minimum wage laws they have to lay off enough employees to afford paying others while still meeting demand. Everyone who was laid off now has a legal barrier keeping them from employment unless they have skills more valuable than the minimum wage.gtwhat do you guys believe about healthcare? Do you think its bad if the government steps in to make HC non profit EU style considering how important this is?Absolutely. The government has no right to use force unless it is to stop an act of force.And if by nonprofit you mean that in the EU healthcare firms are actually required to sell healthcare at cost so they dont pocket any money thats mental. Making money is what motivates them to offer a better product for a better price. If they make no money either way why protect the business and avoid decisions like using its money to buy  million cat costumes? What motivates them to do research into better equipment and improve their services?gt How do you believe we can combat the reality that some corporations become so big that they amass enough political power to bend the laws to their favor effectively damaging the freedom of the market if not through regulation?They still do that regardless of regulation. I personally think the solution should be that we just dont have a government but thats not every libertarian just ancaps.gt Dont you believe that affordable education will help the free market?Stealing peoples money to fund a public school is not affordable education. Public schools are terrible because they do not draw from the strength of the free market so no matter how much they fail they still get a pay check. Right now the only private schools around are extremely expensive and only the wealthy go there but thats not how it would be if public schools were abolished. Just like anything else there will be cheaper alternatives that want to make money by selling to those who cant afford higher prices. Those private schools simply dont exist now because even if a private school is cheaper than tax money that goes to public schools youre paying those taxes regardless.Thank you for coming here always welcome a chance to preach and explain our philosophy.,Libertarian,d3h28yk,1,t5_2qh63

Basically the Rothbardian position probably the most popular position is that the government has no right to regulate goods like carbon oil coal etc as that stuff is considered private property. However when you pollute the air and send harmful particles onto other peoples property according to Rothbard this can be considered a form of trespassing on others property. So thus people can sue for damages in a court of law. This would make this method of pollution heavily decenitivized so the market will find a way to either make cleaner fuel out of oilcoal or just shift to other energy alternatives. ,Libertarian,d426gss,8,t5_2qh63

Its not unreasonable to think that some like minded bigots would get together and have a club which excludes people they feel are inferior.  The real question is do you have a moral authority to threaten them with violence to change their behavior?  Libertarians say no simply excluding someone is not an act of aggression so its not acceptable to respond with violence.

Earth would tend to return to equilibrium if we just left it alone for a while. We just need to reduce the total cost well pay for it to the point where the economic benefit we gain from global warming inducing actions matches the economic negatives. Currently were warming too quickly for that to be true and were going to pay more than we gained.We just need to stall the increase of global warming as technology gets cheaper and better. For example if we could delay global warming for even five years Biochar would be cheap and plentiful and we could sequester large amounts of carbon with it. But currently its expensive to make.gt Is it an external cost on this person? Yes but this is the free market where you have the freedom to choose how you live.That violates the primary tenet of libertarianism your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. Without their consent the fireworks user would have taken a cost from their neighbor for their personal benefit. Thats effectively identical to stealing.Perhaps it would still end up being Pareto efficient as the neighbor could pay the owner of the fireworks to not use them but thats still effectively extortion.gtWhen the government interferes with a business operation in any way it is no longer free market.And this isnt in and of itself a bad thing. Gangs are a business but you wouldnt want them to go unchecked. The free market is good. It is not perfect.gtBut with some of the lowest profit margins of any industry its still cheaper and therefore more profitable for them to leave the country. For every gallon of gas sold Exxon makes . and the government makes .. This is the kinda thing im talking about if they already lose  of their profits to the US government then lose more because of additional taxes and regulations put on the company what possible reason do they have to stay?Exxon pays zero in income taxes. Not one cent. Large corporations can get away completely scot free from them. That money is all sales taxes. And Exxon would continue to pay them because they cant exactly not sell in one of the biggest markets on the planet. Europe has much stricter climate laws and they still do business there.Incidentally thats an opinion article by a partisan source the CEO of a politically motivated organization that doesnt include any sources. Im not going to claim the .. figure is wrong but Id doubt his other conclusions.gtMy choices might have an impact on another person but it is not a rd parties right nor responsibility to prevent me from crashing my car So then the other person should have no way to get recompense for being harmed? What if that person decided to permanently cripple you in retaliation for scratching their paint?The government has not just the right but the responsibility to prevent third parties from being negatively affected by the actions of another. Trading freedom for security is the entire point of the government. Otherwise we might as well just save ourselves the trouble and become an anarchy.gtI am of the belief as a libertarian that each person should be responsible for their own actions and that the government should stay out of it Thats nice in theory but so is communism. Even if  of people are good that  is still going to ruin it for everyone. If the government doesnt step in how can you make sure that  takes responsibility for their own actions? And if your recommendation is any variant of force them then youre right back to where you started a group of people imposing their will on the majority. AKA a government.Every time someone tries out pure libertarianism we end up with feudalism instead. Our species wideequilibrium is some smaller group having control of a larger group. Thats so far outcompeted every other form of government. You can certainly believe pure libertarianism would be the best outcome on a personal scale but its unwise as a policy decision.gtAnd unless you are saying these people are warred with each other because of climate change causing famine my point holds true.Climate change causes famine causes war all the time. Anthropogenic climate change is recent but would you really disagree about whether people have gone to war because of bad growing conditions leading to widespread death?gtWhile I might agree with you that lack of food surely inhibits a culture from becoming peaceful in no way would I list climate change as the most inhibiting force on the middle east and its future with peace.Lack of food alone? No. But the biggest things nations fight over are resources and as long as resources have to be fought over therell be war.gtHow can you justify restrictions on a gas company because they might cause droughts which might cause hunger which might cause disease but not restrictions on Islam which just last night killed  people and injured  more because of their sexuality?They have caused droughts which have caused hunger. And the reason I dont support restrictions on Islam are simple the number of deaths caused by islam and the proportion of Muslims that are terrorists are so small the overall benefit economic and otherwise of restricting Islam would be far far outweighted by the overall cost. It would cost billions to do effectively erode protections on freedom of speech and freedom of religion negatively affect the lives of millions of innocent Americans and tank Americas reputation abroad. All that to save a statistically insignificant number of american lives. people dead in a day is sad on a personal level its easy to see them and empathize for their families. But on a national level far more people die to bathroom accidents every year and barely anyone cares despite it being a bigger deal in the aggregate.Its the same as guns compared to other causes of death guns are effectively harmless. But theyre scary weapons and the solution to them seems obvious so people get emotionally attached to fighting for gun control. I think guns should be regulated more if only to prevent suicides but compared to my other issues I dont give a shit.Its the utilitarian calculus thats important not what my feelings tell me but the cold hard numbers on a spreadsheet.gtHow would a government imposing restrictions on companies be more valuable than alternatives?Have you heard of the prisoners dilemna?Lets say you have two options snitch or dont snitch. Similarly your partner in crime has the same options. Should one person snitch while the other doesnt they get out of jail while the other person gets  months. Should both snitch both get  months  months minus some for cooperating. Should neither snitch both get  three months in jail. So your best option is of course to Defect or snitch while your partner in crime doesnt. But your partner has the exact same information you do they want to snitch while you dont.Now regardless of which action partner takes you get the least time in jail if you snitch. In game theory lingo snitching strongly dominates not snitching because its always your best option.Its the same thing for your partner hell always snitch over not snitch.Which of course leads to both of you snitching on each other.So given freedom of choice both of you make a suboptimal outcome  months in jail each.But lets put a government into the equation. Your boss calls you up and uses Threat Of Force. That is to say he tells both of you that if you snitch youll end up wearing concrete underwear as youre thrown off a bridge. So instead you Cooperate and receive three months in jail. Thats less jail time for you and less jail time in total.The intrusion of a third agent by removing your freedom to choose improves outcomes for everyone.Its the same thing for climate regulations. Its in the best monetary interest of every single company to not cut down pollution and to hide that theyre doing so. Their CEOs might like the idea of not polluting but if they dont do so they get knocked out of the running. So polluting strongly dominates not polluting and we get a race to the bottom.But instead the government steps in and regulates pollution. Companies still make profits albeit less than they probably would have and the air stays relatively clean.tldr The government messing in the free market is better than the alternatives because the free market is ruthless and cutthroat and thats not always a good thing.,Libertarian,d46q9wi,1,t5_2qh63

8247241,0,t1_d58gaey, Immunization is so well studied that there is an entire field of medical science built around it Immunology the same cannot be said for cutting up the sexual organs of healthy children.    Similarly there is no discernible difference between a child who has been immunized and a child who has not been immunized except that the immunized child has an objectively superior immune system the same cannot be said for circumcision which leaves the victim with scarring and objectively diminished functionality. In the context of libertarianism outside of the fact that its common for governments including many in the United States to use taxpayer money to subsidize this surgery on completely healthy children there is indeed a question of authoritarianism.     A child becomes an independent adult youd better have a damn good reason to explain why it was not a violation of his rights to excise a sizable chunk of his cock.        I suspect that explaining your choice to have a child immunized is a lot easier than explaining your choice to have a child circumcised.     Either you can defend some phenomenon as your property or you cannot justification is your ability to convince others to condone if not aid your defense.        In a libertarian society your behavior must also be justifiable to other members of society otherwise you risk reprisal from someone who finds your behavior unjustifiable.        Choosing to cut up your own penis will almost always be justifiable to others but that becomes a much murkier topic when speaking of cutting up someone elses penis regardless of the familial relationship.,Libertarian,d58glhp,1,t5_2qh63

My guess is it is simply a tactic to sucker people into paying more. What they should do is send a letter saying this is what you owe sign to agree or feel free to have a professional check our math instead of defaulting to the screw you here is a bill for a few million bucks. But I think we all know the IRS is not there to serve the people it is simply a collections agency on steroids with unconstitutional power and zero accountability.

In the  general election campaign  states had no campaign events and minuscule or no spending for TV ads.More than  of presidential campaign attention ad spending and visits was invested on voters in just the only ten competitive states.. Twothirds  of  of the generalelection campaign events and a similar fraction of campaign expenditures were in just four states Ohio Florida Virginia and Iowa. Issues of importance to nonbattleground states are of so little interest to presidential candidates that they dont even bother to poll them individually. Over  of both Romney and Obama campaign offices were in just the then  swing states. The few campaign offices in the  remaining states were for fundraising volunteer phone calls and arranging travel to battleground states.The political reality is that campaign strategies in ordinary elections are based on trying to change a reasonably achievable small percentage of the votes  or . The only  states that received any attention in the  general election campaign for President were states where the outcome was between  and  Republican  that is within  percentage points of Romneys eventual nationwide percentage of . .Since World War II a shift of a few thousand votes in one or two states would have elected the secondplace candidate in  of the  presidential elections Policies important to the citizens of nonbattleground states are not as highly prioritized as policies important to battleground states when it comes to governing.Battleground states receive  more federal grants than spectator states twice as many presidential disaster declarations more Superfund enforcement exemptions and more No Child Left Behind law exemptions.Compare the response to hurricane Katrina in Louisiana a safe state to the federal response to hurricanes in Florida a swing state under Presidents of both parties.

I do believe deep down that taxation is theft. But if we decide that asking a citizen to give up literally anything so that a government can exist is morally wrong and we shouldnt do it then the only logical conclusion you can come to is that anarchy is the only morally correct solution and that making rules for a society is always wrong  of the time.I choose to believe that a group of people coming together to protect each others rights is worth each of them giving up something to do it.Edit Look I dont think were going to agree. To me theres a catch. The problem were trying to solve is that people should have certain rights but theres no good way to guarantee those rights without government. Sadly government requires taxation which in turn infringes on the rights of the people its trying to protect. So you can either look at it and say the noncoercion principle says its better to have no government than any government or you can say its better to collectively give up some rights as a society to protect those who cant protect themselves. Because without government its survival of the fittest and our rejection of that principle is one of the very things that separates us from nonsentient species. The idea that you shouldnt have to be better than the person next to you just to survive. In my opinion thats one of the greatest evils in existence.,Libertarian,d64f6m8,1,t5_2qh63

We are all stuck on the same space ship.But with government and central planning comes a huge opening for misuse of power. A new world order. From a practical standpoint a US only emission tax would result in a crescendo of add on regulations to level the playing field between US and nonUS entities. Regulation begets more regulation. So no I dont agree with a US only tax on US produced emissions. The China example is perfect. The Chinese smog you see is a result of the products manufactured in China and consumed by the US. obviously Im generalizing. I dont know a solution.

There is a highest price that consumers will pay for any item set by those consumers. The cost of the labor to make a product or deliver a service has to be less than i.e. a subset of the price. The price must also encompass all of the other costs of bringing that good or service to market. The price that a good business man sets for a product is one that will maximize sales in a market. The wage for labor that the same businessman pays is the lowest wage that the market for labor will bear and still retain the worker. The owner hires workers whose skill and value match the needs of the product. There is not a lot of wiggle room in the math.If you pay McDonalds workers  an hour and they hire the same number of people the prices will be higher than eating at Applebees or Chilis.

8948424,0,t3_52u92q,. The tax plan he is advocating is revenue neutral but would substantially lower the cost of compliance for individudals and businesses lower the cost of administration for government and ensure everyone is paying taxes including those with no traditional documented sources of income. He has promised to submit a balanced budget within  day and would use zero based budgetting to look at the value each individudal program provides to justify its continued inclusion in the budget.. He still supports the EPA but would be recommending the elimination of existing subsidies for fossil fuel exploration and production. I also expect him to recommend the elimination of subsidies for feedstock crops such as corn which will reduce methane emissions from livestock fed corn heavy diets and mass agriculture. If the FairTax is passed by Congress it would most likely also apply equally to energy purchases such as gasoline. Libertarians also support looking into ways to pay for roads with user fees rather than general taxes so that the primary cost of road maintenance would come from large semi trucks causing road wear. Over subsidization of roads by governments via taxes have lead to decreased private investment in rail and mass transit suburban sprawl longer commutes and greater pollution.

And quickly aggressively shifts the goalposts to just name any foreign leader while Johnson tries to think of Vicente Foxs name. Gary Im sure was eager to talk about the former Mexican president who championed free markets and helped facilitate the creation of millions of jobs in mexico and more recently told Donald Trump quote We will not pay for no fucking wall.Johnson is still trying to answer the original question with his honest preferred answer. Weld suggests fox zedillo and Johnson says Fox Vicente Fox. So clearly he does know the names of foreign leaders since Weld only supplied Fox. He also talks about foreign leaders regularly in his QAs and speeches but he would be unlikely to mention those he talks about most like trudeau Putin Assad Merkel Calderon or Jinping as people he admires as a classical liberal.So this is a nonstory. Clearly Gary Johnson can name foreign leaders. The conservative and liberal media both are putting this clip of Gary staying focused on the issue at hand on blast because they know if they put up the clips of him saying things like we need to treat drugs as a mental health issue not a criminal issue or We cant keep doubling the national debt every  years thats insane or correctly analyzing foriegn policy situations instead of deflecting and asking for more power to spy on American citizens... a whole lot of people would vote for him.Hillary and Trump want more war more debt more surveillance of Americans and fewer constitutional protections for the common person they just differ in a few details. Trumps foriegn policy is absolutely insane Hillarys policies have directly armed and empowered ISIS and other jihadi groups in Syria and greatly contributed to a million person and counting refugee crisis. Hillary supports continued shelling of ethnic Russian civilians in Crimea to protect them from Russia. Hillary is going pass the TPP she might wait a bit and pass it under a new bill with a different name or piecemeal. I actually think a free trade agreement with south east Asia that excludes China is vital to American interests but she is just saying she wont sign it for Berner votes. She will.A lot of people would vote for Johnson if they heard him and bill weld talk about gay rights and individual liberty in the nineties while Clinton was saying I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Or if they heard Johnson talking about mass incarceration and ending the drug war while Clinton was pushing minimum sentencing laws and calling black children superpredators. Or if they heard about how he founded a  employee construction company in college while Trump was dodging the draft taxes and lawsuits begging for corporate welfare declaring bankruptcy getting  dollar loans from his parents etc.The concerns about his Aleppo comments are also quite ironic. Gary Johnson has been advocating working with Russia in Syria for years while Clinton and Obama stomped their feet and carried on with the absurd Assad Must Go rhetoric and handed american weapons to terrorists and directly contributed to the  person and counting refugee crisis. Now they agree with Governor Johnson... only  years too late!The whole thing is a partisan misconstruction by the mainstream partys media lapdogs.

But we also tend to agree that they have at least some rights.

In our world I think that would lead to some pretty horrific treatment of minority groups. I look at the issue as not being black or white at all. The cake baker example is poorly described as either having to bake all cakes or not having to make any cakes. There are multiple layers to consider.  Should a baker be required to make a cake for a customer she knows to be gay?  Should the baker be required to bake a cake for a gay person knowing that the cake is to be served at a gay wedding?  Should a baker be required to deliver the cake to the wedding venue if she customarily does so for hetero weddings?  Should the bake be required to serve the cake at the wedding if she customarily does so for hetero weddings? In each case theres an escalation in the amount of support for the wedding that the baker is required to show. I tend to draw the line in between  and . A baker should make cakes for gay people. That doesnt require them to show any support for homosexuality. Rather it simply requires them to respect for another human being.  do require the baker to take some level of participation in a gay wedding so thats too far for me. ,Libertarian,d94zpm3,10,t5_2qh63

9472669,0,t3_5aifml,There is a lot of goodfaith disagreement among libertarians about how or even whether the NAP should be followed in extreme examples like this. Youll also find some libertarians arguing that because of extreme hypotheticals of the NAP that it shouldnt be followed at all. So its important to differentiate the moral philosophy of the NAP vs the political philosophy of libertarianism. There are many who are libertarian because they follow the NAP and there are many still who want more liberty for reasons other than the NAP. Libertarianism is one of the very very few political philosophies that doesnt ascribe moral or social philosophy to its followers. The result is that individuals within it are often really diverse in an actual sense of the word. I have literally seen a libertine and social conservative baptist preacher agree on most every political point because of this. To most other political philosophies not having a top down social and moral organization looks chaotic but its actually completely consistent.Anyway my round about point is that you dont have to follow the NAP to want more liberty and as such technically qualify as a libertarian. Those who do follow the NAP as a moral philosophy will like most all moral philosophies follow it as a general guideline and carve out exceptions in extreme scenarios and most people at least generally tend to follow a similar version of the NAP in agreeing the statement you shouldnt hurt other people.In your example a follower of the NAP could argue that the general consistent purpose of it is to eschrew violence in every case except self defense. Because life liberty and property are seen by many as synonymous and you cant possess one without the others violence is only permissible to the extent that you defend your property and remove the trespasser and anything above that is a violation of the NAP.Virtually everyone I know who does follow the NAP argues something similar in the lines of reasonable response. I dont know of any of them who would argue that if you scuff someones shoes they have a right to kill you for example. TLDR libertarians dont have to follow the NAP but those who do rarely if ever justify excessive force.                ,Libertarian,d9gpm2n,7,t5_2qh63

It is an evolutionary concept that those who have low survivability will reproduce more. This is to make up for the fact that the environment is not advantageous to their growth. The races that are better  arent better for the values that you state. Selfsustainability comes from having control of your environment education is a privilege of those who have excess time to contemplate saving is again a privelege of those who dont live paychecktopaycheck and family support is something that would exist if given the right environmental support even animals are capable of this if the situations are favorable. Good genetics and an abundance in environmental resources is a huge factor in the success of a species. This is not something that is questioned at this point. Give people help with both of these and you will see any group of people thrive. We are all born randomly into different regions of the globe and those things that shape us give us advantages with certain things while making us disadvantageous for others. Societies were created to make up for those individual differences since groups thrive in the wild more than individuals. This is exactly what we should continue to consider if we are to go further. To live like we are in the wild i.e. caring only for ourselves is what animals do right now and wont let us grow beyond that.No one individual is to be credited for the success of mankind because we are incapable of achieving such marvelous feats on our own. We work together and thats what made it all possible. When you remove the assumptions of how some human beings are inefficient and incapable but instead come to understand the complexities that influence how a person reacts and develops then you will come to understand why it is that we need to at the very least give equal opportunities to make that possible. We cannot easily undo generations of poor upbringing easily but at the very least we should not assume that everyone should be equally capable of bringing up their family as those who were set off to a better start.

Many many many many people are currently in federal prision right now for crimes that were legal under the state law.

9704362,0,t1_da97h8j,I read about  of it and then just got tired of the author saying Trump is bad but racism is the least of our worries.... My point is which you can see in my original comment I have tried to like Trump because he is our Presidentelect and yet I find that he is consistently a disappointment and embarrassment.  Furthermore we cannot ignore the fact that he is racist.  He is.  End of story.  My thoughts on the article  Is Trump as racist as the Left says?  I agree with the author probably not. Regardless I cannot get on board with the Well Trump is kinda racist but its because he is old and white but other old white people say racist shit too so its OK.  It is clear that on some level he is racist....and I am not ok with that from the leader of our country by the way the argument that other presidents have been racist so its ok doesnt fly either.This shit is getting too old.  Racism should not continue to be a thing yet it is! The author at the end states that we need to stop fearmongering.  I completely agree fearmongering is terrible.... but saying that Trump isnt racist or that his racism doesnt matter or that racism doesnt exist is crazy.  This isnt fear mongering its a reality that minorities deal with all the time in their every day lives and white people cant just explain that away any longer I am a white upper class male by the way Just a little bit of an anecdote to explain why I feel the way I do about this and why I care so much.  I was recently living in a california city that is known to be lower income and a majority nonwhite.  While there I worked with kids who had difficult home lives mostly black and latino because of the part of town we were located in.  We found the money because amazing people donated it to take these kids to a summer camp which we thought would be an amazing experience... It was the worst experience.  The whole week was shrouded in racism hate and fear.  From the moment we got there everyone else looked at my group different and I say this as a leader who is white and had never experienced anything like that before....it was unmistakable.  The first night everyone went to a big bonfire and I had to round up my guys because guess what...the camp decided that our cabin was the one they were going to randomly inspect they found nothing by the way....  For the first time I realized that the medias BS about racism and bigotry wasnt so made up.  For the first time I felt my white privileged in a new way. And it didnt stop there.  My kids got called the nword one was told he was a pretty good swimmer for a black kid and other kids refused to play against us in paintball because they have probably actually shot people before so it isnt fair if we have to play against them.  And I know some people are ok with a little bit of racism in the president but I am not....  I had  year old boys cry in my arms and tell me they would rather be back at home in abusive houses with the devil they know instead of up in the woods being treated like third rate citizens.... and I agreed with them.  I felt for them.  Their fear and hurt was real....not made up by the media. So why are we not doing something about this?  Why is a little bit of racism ok?

9878789,0,t1_dav6ofw,Logic is harsh and reality is pretty damn miserable. The fact of the matter is that healthcare will always have an inevitable cutoff point. Whats particularly troubling is the more that medicine advances the worse this problem becomes. As our life extension techniques get better people will live longer but worse. At best theyll be popping dozens of pills per day and struggling to maintain independence at worst theyll be be tethered to machines as a more stretched out and overworked healthcare labor force is unable to keep up with demand.The original and most natural way this problem sorted itself out was the financial strain caused by prolonging the inevitable. Socialized medicine does not eliminate the root problem at all. The cutoff decider becomes the waiting list and individuals ability to hold out for weeksmonths. This can ironically boil back down to moneypower as the system can be gamedbribed.Also calling libertarians sociopaths is cliche...and a bit ironic since shifting the burden of the inherent limits of healthcare from the individual to a faceless entity IS sociopathic. Its individuals responsibility to invest in healthcare if they want healthcare and its their right to be able to scale their healthcare.

If taxes were decreased past the minimum level needed to supply courts and justice services and there were not private justice firms able to increase output at a rate of efficiency greater than that of central government then people would be worse off and have a hard time making ends meets before taxes than after.,Libertarian,dax3g1g,1,t5_2qh63

9944544,0,t1_db3rrcc,By Christopher MimsDec.    p.m. ETSince the s when automated teller machines arrived the number of bank tellers in America has more than doubled. James Bessen an economist who teaches at Boston University School of Law points to that seeming paradox amid new concerns that automation is stealing human jobs. To the contrary he says jobs and automation often grow hand in hand.Sometimes of course machines really do replace humans as in agriculture and manufacturing says Massachusetts Institute of Technology labor economist David Autor in a succinct and illuminating TED talk which could have served as the headline for this column. Across an entire economy however Dr. Autor says thats never happened.The threat that machines pose to workers is in the news again after an election that turned on the frustration of workingclass voters. Last week Amazon.com Inc. introduced Amazon Go a store without cashiers.Three days later Presidentelect Donald Trump nominated Andy Puzder chief executive of CKE Restaurants Holdings Inc. the parent company of Hardees and Carls Jr. chains to be secretary of labor. Mr. Puzder has said that selfserve ordering kiosks like those recently unveiled by McDonalds Corp.  will help his company eliminate workers.Such developments are worrying. But a long trail of empirical evidence shows that the increased productivity brought about by automation and invention ultimately leads to more wealth cheaper goods increased consumer spending power and ultimately more jobs.In the case of bank tellers the spread of ATMs meant bank branches could be smaller and therefore cheaper. Banks opened more branches and in total employed more tellers Mr. Bessen says.Some individuals are uprooted and suffer. In   of U.S. workers toiled in agriculture today that figure is less than . Manufacturing employment in industrialized countries has declined in recent decades as fewer people make more goods. But society on the whole has come out ahead.Its true that technology alters the quality as well as the quantity of jobs. Ian Stewart chief U.K. economist at Deloitte LLP in the U.K. cowrote a paper last year that used census data as far back as the late s to examine the changing nature of jobs in the U.K. cradle of the industrial revolution.The authors found big increases in both lowpaying and highpaying jobs. There are more barbers and barkeepers. But there also are more accountants and nurses reflecting the rising complexity of the modern economy.Paradoxically says Mr. Stewart many of the fields most transformed by technology have produced the biggest increases in employment from medicine to management consulting. What we saw was that machines and people were highly complementary he says.Such bifurcated labor markets have ill effects. Disappearing factory jobs have largely been replaced by jobs in the service sector where highly skilled workers like doctors and computer programmers are paid more while many others see to the comfort and health of the affluent. In the middle wages have stagnated helping spawn our current age of populism.The era of mass manufacturing employment in the s and s was a good thing says Dr. Autor. It created a lot of good jobs it needed a lot of hands and eyes and required some skills but not an enormous skill set. The work was relatively high value added. But he adds that era is for the most part behind us.Thats helped fuel arguments from pundits technologists and armchair economists that this time is different that the emerging combination of robotics and artificial intelligencealready spawning robot security guards and selfdriving truckswill render many people permanently unemployable.Im more optimistic. For all the recent advances in artificial intelligence such techniques are largely applied to narrow areas such as recognizing images and processing speech. Humans can do all these things and more which allows us to transition to new kinds of work.Some of my fellow optimists worry about the people being left behind. The exact same thing is happening that has always happenedwere evolving and the jobs are changing says Rob Nail CEO of Singularity University in Silicon Valley. The one major difference however is that the time of change is compressing because the pace of technology is moving exponentially.Mr. Bessen the Boston University economist says the problem is not mass unemployment its transitioning people from one job to another.Other countries devote more resources than the U.S. to cushioning and retraining displaced workers. As a share of gross domestic product Denmark spends  times as much says Dr. Autor.He offers another historical example. Near the end of the th century Americas agricultural states faced the prospect of mass unemployment as farms automated.In response they created the high school movement which required everyone to stay in school until age . It was hugely expensive both because of the new schools and teachers but also because these young people could no longer work on the farm. But it better prepared workers for th century factory jobs and fueled the explosion in college attendance after World War II.As a country Were very wealthy says Dr. Autor. If anyone can do anything about this transition its us.,Libertarian,db3srdj,6,t5_2qh63

Everyone decried Hillary for changing views over the course of decades but Trump changed views over the course of interviews.

Racism will never die truly and one such reason is racism breeds itself. My father grew up a poor white boy in the ghetto of brooklyn in new york. He was mugged almost every day of his life getting told hey white boy empty them pockets. The school he went to let kids out early on martin luther king day because local black gangs were known to target and jump white kids as revenge. According to the left this is rare and they dont even want to put it in the same league as the other things they bitch about so they made up a phrase for it reverse racism. here is the president belittling the issue and actually breathing life in the joke that racism against white people is nothing of note..  people fucking laugh when he mentions it and tries to say that blacks are not be employed because race? really.... and then gender gap bullshit. this is my biggest issue with the left. blinding ignorant in a narrative and if it doesnt fit your narrative it is racist. not all of them are like that and i have a lot of left views but race and gender is probably far from that shit. ,Libertarian,dbeso6z,1,t5_2qh63

However there can still be a lot of confounds when describing changes in the numbers of crimes particularly with threats like hate crimes. Threats often contain some ambiguity so counting threats will depend on the mental state of the target  both whether they interpreted it as a threat and whether they felt it was serious enough to report.Regardless of the currently available statistics hate crimes do occur and there are enough warning signs of a worsening environment that we should prepare ourselves to respond.

They may sell the land to the government or just give it up. Either way the land becomes protected space. You cant even put up farms on this land unless they give permission to someone else to do just that.This also affects businesses as you cant build new industrial or office buildings on those plots of land. Which definitely affects competition as people are having to compete with what officeindustrial space is available for use.Thomas Sowell goes over this in his books Economic Facts and Falacies Basic Economics and The Housing Boom and Bust. The Housing Boom and Bust uses the green space issue to illustrate why homes of the same inherit value in Texas and in California are at different prices.By inherit value Im talking about the labour and materials required to build the house.

My first job about a decade ago was at an animal grooming and boarding shop. It paid hour. That would be illegal today since minimum wage laws prevent that job from existing. But the experience I gained at that job was invaluable to me. I learned how to deposit a check into a bank account save money work a schedule communicate with the public get bit by dogs and shovel poop etc. haha Without entry level jobs for low skilled workers where would those workers obtain the skills to move up in their careers?People tend to be paid what theyre worth.

So the kids who do want to succeed who have parents who do care dont get the education they need because teachers are too busy focusing on a bunch of miscreants.If you are able to put these kids instead into a school that is selective in its enrollment then like minded kids can be an environment of learning and success. Regular public schools cant be selective in this way.Most people dont want to face this reality.

The issue is that it doesnt address what disturbs people who are paying to fund an organization that they believe are contradicting their view of rights of individuals who are unborn.PP provides in the majority of their work services that reduce the costs of public health. Birth control STD screenings etc. have demonstrably shown a net positive effect on womens health which results in reduced healthcare costs. For those efforts public funding is a good deal. It should continue.The objectionable activity should be handled separately. The beef the evangelists have is that the organization is aloof to their concerns. Thats an issue. You can say these babies will be unwanted and they will be criminals etc. but to the ear of the evangelist you are saying theyre forsaken while still at the age of innocence and this is incongruous to that philosophy.

It is also the only political ideology that does not seek to impose itself on others it just asks that you dont force your ideology on others voluntary socialism and collectivism is completely compatible with libertarianism and if you look we had a strong social support network before the government stepped in and gave us a less collectivist society where you can more easily isolate yourself from community by relying on a distant monopoly of force.

Then that store is open to everyone in the state. And in fact the minority groups would be forced to patronize the store essentially creating a guaranteed clientele.The discriminating owner would also risk people not patronizing his business because he discriminates.Overall the risk for the discriminating business is probably pretty high particularly in larger areas with a higher density of minorities. So unless your clientele is pretty much exclusively the group you prefer your business would likely take quite a hit.Now in Wisconsin where I live there are areas in excess of  white.

10750955,0,t1_ddoq69u,Yes all types of taxes are bad. They disrupt the free market and force additional financial burden on people. However sales tax is by far preferable to income taxes for libertarians.The first issue is complexity. Our current system is so complex that companies now advertise the use of supercomputers to file them. This complexity causes massive compliance costs beyond the tax rate for the entire country that stifles economic growth. A sales tax has almost no complexity and can be written to cover compliance within the collected taxes.Another issue is transparency. A huge portion  of taxes are hidden within the price of goods and services making it impossible to know how much tax each individual actually pays. A simple sales tax prevents this by levying taxes once during the final transaction.A sales tax is also much more fair in the sense that it doesnt give preference to anyone. Is a sales tax libertarian? Of course not. However its the best way to levy taxes from a libertarian perspective in todays world.,Libertarian,ddovn1k,3,t5_2qh63

Heres the thing. Automation is going to steadily replace human jobs no matter what to the point where it will be impossible for a decent portion of the country to find work. There will be more efficiency but all the profits generated by this automated efficiency will go to company profits.

Well you can tax company profits higher and establish a universal basic income. This may not be a bad idea but Im willing to bet there will be plenty of loopholes. Or you can do what Bill Gates said. Tax robots that replace human jobs. This way companies will be forced to keep hiring human employees until their machines are efficient enough that they not only are able to increase company profits but are able to increase profits to the point where they can support the human whos job they took and still have money left over that goes to company profits.I know some of you may disagree with this but express your disagreement through well thoughtout comments as opposed to downvotes.,Libertarian,ddw06re,2,t5_2qh63

10913674,0,t3_5vu8g8,Its cute. But you are missing the point. The republicans arent a single political party. They havent been since before FDR. In reality its an alliance of differing sub parties that tend to vote together against the leftist issues they agree upon. Its difficult to find proper funding without the name brand. Rand and Ron Paul are the two feature examples that should come to mind. Ron more than Ayns namesake but they both lean toward liberty versus left and right. Even Reagan admitted to believing that libertarianism was the true heart of conservatism while he had to compromise with a statist congress and spend massively to defeat the dialectic and aggression of the Soviets. The point is that the right as it is known in the USA is more often than not for smaller government. The problem is that picking the battles they can win requires favors with other parts of the political alliance that sometimes requires voting along lines or slightly against ones ideology. Healthcare is a great example. I am completely against all government subsidized healthcare programs. I mathematically understand that the market can do it cheaper and better. However were I elected to represent my district and the majority of my constituents wanted healthcare management from the government I would be required by my ideals to entertain  discussion on how to do that most cheaply with as little interference with the market as possible.

We value fashion stupidity celebrity thuggery and slacker disinterest.The reason that our culture does not value education is that it is free and everyone has one.

Im not against the anarchy approach. As much as it does take something close to perfect information for everyone to really make anarchy work as a form of governance. Given thered be people who act shortsighted for whatever reason so without perfect information accountability is out of the window in such a setup. People can just tell you bullshit stories to justify their use of things and their actions where they are seen.gt Lockes proviso if taken to its ultimate consequences would lead to the impossibility of any property whatsoeverIt would debunk that mechanism of appropriation if anything. I think thats something to appreciate about the Lockean Proviso in a way. Its a reminder about how reality as we come to accept it today is not always fair and about justice being slighted there.gt I believe that homesteading as a legitimate form of appropriating unowned land is a logical consequence from the selfownership principleHomesteading usually does rely on the Lockean Proviso being fulfilled and so does selfownership. So for one you are perfectly free to own your identity your sense of self. And when it comes to your body this is something you might want to ponder on for yourself!gt Moreover I dont see how the first comer being the appropriator is unjust the homesteader committed no aggression against anyone neither worsened anyones current situation. What makes you think that just because you didnt worsen anyones current situation you didnt worsen anyones future situation? If we have no accountability towards the future if only the current situation is relevant why would we be concerned about climate change for one? Why not dump nuclear waste into rivers where nobody is going to drink from in the current moment? How far into the future are we accountable how far are we not?gt A second comer demanding that the first pay him taxes however is indeed committing an aggression against the homesteader and making his situation worst.I would speculate that looking at todays changing world of work it might actually make the homesteaders situation better to pay taxes if it means more people can do creative chance based work and if aggregate demand is improved.But yeah this isnt so much about homesteading at that point but about all the other resources that are arguably kept away from the masses by some principle of someone having come first. In a world where we solve the issue of reproduction and delivery of known itemsservices habitual customer awareness and network effect based monopolization are much more a concern. Where disruption is increasingly hard to come by for your average entrepreneur. Since most people would not work in those fields anymore where they deliver or reproduce something that is known. Very different situation.Maybe wed want to consider customer awareness a kind of thing for people to leave as much and as good behind for others or an agreeable compensation if we want for people to still be able to voluntarily contribute to each others experiences and for additional income. Since to me the world of work would look like one where people increasingly work on conceiving things that customers dont exactly know about yet that dont have huge networks of users yet. Think of a world of work where everyones doing something that might overtake coca cola as the go to brand of beverages or of course disrupting more interesting markets.gt If you think about it its much easier to move to an already settled and developed city than to move to the middle of nowhere and have to start a city from scratch.Maybe if property relations are not used to force domination of people by people into the equation. Sadly this seems to be whats happening today. Again not really predominantly by the means of land ownership but idea customer awareness and financial capital ownership paired with those QE bailouts.Its those who can not opt out from doing low pay work that make low pay work pay low. This further messes up everyone elses opportunities to make a decent living cleaning toilets while its not automated yet. Even slowing down automation as market capitalization is lower in those industries then due to artifically depressed wages depressed aggregate demand. While were increasingly on the way to a world of creative chance based work either way. In my view anyhow. Pretty basic but readable article on the opportunities and challenges if things indeed are heading that way.gt So the second comer is also having some advantages that the first comer didnt have.Certainly he has some advantage and some disadvantage. This doesnt quantify the advantage and the disadvantage and the advantage and disadvantage are of fundamentally different substance. So I see more problems than anything when justice is not considered when freedom of the second comer is not considered. The second comer could probably at least subsist if he had what the person who came first had. Its also doubtful that much of the advantage was provided by the original appropriator of any specific thing nor by whoever ended up having the thing today. Its a kind of legacy of our forefathers and we just dont know who did what if investigating just a little into the topic of who were the hard workers and who were the winners of previous industrial revolutions and labor relations in general.

If it costs k per year to properly raise a family of five and the heads of household bring in k pretax and pay an effective  rate that leaves them with about the k per year they need to properly raise their family and put a couple thousand in a Roth to supplement our dwindling social security program.  A five person household with a total k income could obviously afford to pay k in taxes without seeing a huge hit to their ability to properly care for themselves and their dependents not that I would personally recommend such a high marginal rate  especially on the first half million in income. Perhaps the ideal marginal tax rates for a modern society is somewhere in the middle?

If they resist these punitive efforts then this will eventually morph into violence. This is true of all possible policy arrangements.

11396580,0,t1_dfnqami,You assume competition can exist in a society where property rights supersede all. Lets break this down for you.I own my home and  others that I rent out. Under libertarian beliefs after the government is shrunk either to nothing or in an ideal limited fashion I still own  houses and can rent them. There will still be a demand for rental property and loans would likely get harder to get for people no government subsidies. I could use my assets to buy more assets more easily than those renting from me we see this a lot today even and buy up housing that is lower on the ladder. Without taxation my profits rise so I can buy more property and own more land faster. The demand for rentals increases as I am limiting the number of available homes by buying them up and nobody else can really compete unless I am not actively buying in their area. In a good outcome I would have over  homes by the time I die.No inheritance tax I want to pass everything to my children. I teach them the same way to make money and while none might be as good or as lucky as me each would still have  homes as rentals in their name. Income for no work and an incentive to grow. Each doubles their number in their lifetimes and some even marry others of their status so doubling it again. My grandchildren now have over  homes to their names. Lets say I have  so  a piece again and each get a  increase plus marry into rich families.  homes are now in the possession of my family with  families renting from them.Oh but the market will build more homes! yes and the landlords will be the ones buying the cheap ones while the builders will chase the greatest profit luxury homes for the wealthy. My families rental families wont be able to escape the rent trap. again seeing this today already. Worse yet eventually houses will become too expensive and land will become the big ticket item. My family starts buying land and renting it to businesses or builders. The cycle continues till all the land is owned too. What is left?You are either born into a family that owns property or a family that rents. If you are born into a rental family you will never be able to buy a home because cheap homes are all owned by landlords who pay in cash and have no incentive to reduce their home load and all land is owned by the same families. You can only try to save up to buy something...except you would be competing with one of a thousand people who can literally pay any price for the landhouse you want without working.There is no need to make a business when you can own the land and rent it to others. There is no need to work when you can make contracts with people who are born at a disadvantage. There can be no liberty with inherited wealth.,Libertarian,dfnscls,0,t5_2qh63

11437399,0,t3_635579,gt I can post dissenting ideas hereHere is the thing. I dont think people are natural libertarians. It is human nature to have an Us and Them outlook. It is easy to be for things that you like where it becomes difficult is to be ok with the things you or your group do not like. Developing that trait is somewhat unnatural. One has to be able to challenge their world view against other ideas constantly and see if they still hold up. If the dont then it is time to examine that particular viewpoint and see where it might be flawed. The only way this can happen is through open and honest communication between people with different world views. You have to dispense with canned rhetoric and you have to be able to walk away from things you might not have an answer for so you can examine it thoughtfully.,Libertarian,dfsf2bn,2,t5_2qh63

11438994,0,t3_639ybh,Heres Rand Pauls ACA Replacement PlanHighlights.  You control your HC.  Not your employer.  This takes care of I lose my job I lose my health care.  It also provides for tax deductions for health insurance so you can afford more coverage if you want..  You can also use HSAs to deduct more health care expenses.  Makes it easier to pay for things like blood pressure meds and other regular medical costs that really shouldnt be covered by insurance..  Allows physicians to get an additional taxdeduction for donating their timecare..  Insurance reform  You no longer have to buy insurance instate.  You no longer have to put up with paying for coverage you dont need dont want.  You can pool together as individuals or small businesses to purchase group health insurance plans. .  Insurance will have more flexibility to charge depending on risk but it will be cheaper to buy when you are young so like life insurance the principle will be to buy when you are still young and healthy.  The plan also provides a twoyear openenrollment for anyone.  I would extend this idea by establishing a tax credit for any donations to health care foundations or organization like your local hospital foundation.  Instead of one tax dollar flowing through the myriad of steps to provide health care it goes straight into a hospitals budget to provide health care  huge cut of many middlemen.gt And what about those who cant afford health care that would most definitely be privatized which I agree with?If you look at other costpooling and similar arrangements that religious groups are using to avoid ACA for st Amendment reasons they are paying less than  per month.  If you give people the cash you give them choices.  Youve already lowered doctors costs by lowering the administrative burden.  They will also have competitive forces too.   We are also forgetting that for minor health care issues you usually dont need an actual yearsofpostbaccalaureatetrained M.D.  But that is required by health insurance regulations nice way to upcharge!Basically by streamlining the system you are making healthcare more affordable without needing to taxgive people money.  Then we can actually get another look at the kinds of people who still cant afford basic healthcare and do what we have always done  provide it through charity a system which is very good at providing the best possible needed services with minimal waste.,Libertarian,dfslkxx,9,t5_2qh63

I scrolled down until I saw how they calculated it pay gap  median womens income  median mens income. Im already going to discard this study because its clearly trying to push a narrative. The reasons as to why the mens median income is higher is because they choose more dangerous and high paying careers i.e. coal mining and chemical engineering vs. feminist dance therapy.So his first source is bullshit... not a good start. lets move on to the second shall we? So this source is from the government my my look at how authoritative my sources are says john green the numale faggot. But again they calculate the pay gap based on comparing total mens yearly earnings and womens total yearly earnings. this is accounted for by choices men and women make and the dangers of the different jobs.

11525046,0,t1_dg1o0g0,No.  Even you dont call them socialist their political system is a natural consequence of socialism.  it was predicted from first principles not long after Marx came up with his political philosophy.The nation must be transformed into a vast bureaucracy and every individual into a State official. Everything must be done on the cost principle the people having no motive to make a profit out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to own capital no one can employ another or even himself. Every man will be a wagereceiver and the State the only wagepayer. He who will not work for the State must starve or more likely go to prison.Whatever then the State Socialists may claim or disclaim their system if adopted is doomed to end in a State religion to the expense of which all must contribute and at the altar of which all must kneel a State school of medicine by whose practitioners the sick must invariably be treated a State system of hygiene prescribing what all must and must not eat drink wear and do a State code of morals which will not content itself with punishing crime but will prohibit what the majority decide to be vice a State system of instruction which will do away with all private schools academies and colleges a State nursery in which all children must be brought up in common at the public expense and finally a State family with an attempt at stirpiculture or scientific breeding in which no man and woman will be allowed to have children if the State prohibits them and no man and woman can refuse to have children if the State orders them.Say with a straight face this isnt what happened to the USSR China North Korea and is what is happening in Venezeuela.

Edit To everyone downvoting me and then telling me that the root of the opioid problem is prohibition need to spend  minutes and look up what opioid addiction is how it works and how it progresses.  Because the notion that making opioids easier to get would help and not hurt the addicts is absolutely ridiculous.  Im pretty liberal when it comes to drugs but I put opioids heroin oxy percs whatever in its own category.  Once an opioid gets its claws in someone its not longer a recreational drug.  Its a hard physical addiction that is nearly impossible to kick on your own and get progressively worse until the user dies.   That being said Im all for getting the addicts the help that they need and not just tossing them in jail but the people who sell to addicts deserve no such leniency.  These people use predatory tactics to market and sell their product to helpless addicts for a profit.

11535907,0,t1_dg3i7nw,gt Firstly were making a pretty big assumption by saying that hierarchies are better at making decisions one I would dispute.That is a big assumption but one I think is validated by history. However I cant be sure Im not cherrypicking examples and I dont have any kind of systematic review that I can show you. Well disagree on this one.gtA We are dealing with a cooperative and not a communeYoure making a distinction that flew over my head. Whats the difference between a cooperative and a commune?gtB Capitalism is the default mode instead of a more fair scenario with no default modeIm not going to argue that capitalism is naturalistic but what does a more fair default mode look like?gtC There is a state taxing everyone.Im somewhat confused because I thought your previous answers implied the presence of a state. e.g. so I dont think TyrannyCorp should be permitted to employ people implies that there is someone who can decide whether workers are making an uncompelled choice and implies that there is someone who can compel TyrannyCorp to stop employing people when that finding is made. Both of those people need to be paid so doesnt that imply the existence of taxes? gtRegardless you are missing the point. Communes do not aim to compete they aim to provide for the needs of the community they are in and to share excess resources with those who need it. A company is based on acquiring resources for more acquisition and it achieves this end by appeasing those with either the deepest pockets or a large number of people with small pockets and ignoring those with no pockets I might addPoint taken. I would argue that communes do compete for workers and I dont think theyre winning that battle lately.gtIts also worth noting that in a commune jobs are not permanent you could be a janitor one day and deliveryman the next.Small companies have this too. As a system administrator I once cleaned vomit off of the floor of the mens bathroom. I see this as a legibility tradeoff. As the organization gets bigger legibility is more important because the people making decisions are further away from ground truth. In response they hire a janitorial company rather than asking the newest employee to mop up vomit even if its less efficient because thats easier to keep track of.gtIf you would rather work at a company assuming you had a fair choice between the two go ahead. I dont care. In my opinion its your loss.Im concerned that the fair choice you describe wouldnt happen most of the time. For example if youre a chemical engineer there are no employeerun oil refineries. ,Libertarian,dg3lih4,1,t5_2qh63

11770216,0,t3_67yey8,Contra Thomas Piketty Its Impossible To Benefit The Worker By Taxing CapitalThe reviews discussions and critiques of Thomas Pikettys book Capital in the  st Century are still flooding out and theres a new reason to doubt the proposed solution that Piketty proffers in the review for Reason by Garett Jones. Which is that its actually impossible to make the worker or the workers better off by taxing capital. This will surprise many I know but it is one of these things that is actually trueThe Boston University economist Christophe Chamley and the Stanford economist Kenneth Judd came up independently with what we might call the ChamleyJudd Redistribution Impossibility Theorem Any tax on capital is a bad idea in the long run and that the overwhelming effect of a capital tax is to lower wages. A capital tax is such a bad idea that even if workers and capitalists really were two entirely separate groups of peopleif workers could only eat their wages and capitalists just lived off of their interest like a bunch of trustfundersit would still be impossible to permanently tax capitalists hand the tax revenues to workers and make the workers better off.There are more detailed discussions of this by Jones here and by Steven Landsburg here.And the thing about this is that its a rather well known finding too. Which is why optimal taxation theory insists that the correct rate of taxation of returns to capital is zero. And yes there has indeed been a Nobel awarded for this Sir James Mirrlees and thats why the Mirrlees Review of the UK taxation system argues for zero taxation of the returns to capital. Its also why a progressive consumption tax is considered by such luminaries as Bill Gates as to be the desirable direction in which to move the overall system. For that is the effect of such a system to remove taxation from the returns to capital and only impose it upon that capital that people liquidate in order to consume.The underlying reason for this finding can be derived from one of the truly great Paul Krugman essays Ricardos Difficult Idea although I have a distinct feeling that Krugman would prefer not to sign on to the idea of zero capital taxation. Average wages in an economy are determined by the average productivity of labour in that economy. Applying capital to labour is along with technological advancement and the two most certainly interact as well what drives up productivity in an economy. Thus we would like there to be more capital applied to labour as that raises the average income in said economy.And we also know that with the one exception of land the more you tax something the less you get of it. So the effect of taxing either capital or the returns to capital will be to lower the amount of capital applied to labour leave said labour less productive than it would otherwise be and thus leave wages lower than they would otherwise be. Sure the workers who receive the booty stripped from the capitalist will be better off for a while but over time the workers in the future will be poorer than they would have been.Thus our conclusion that we cannot over time make the workers better off by taxing capital. And yet that is the great policy suggestion from Piketty that we must tax capital. Which rather leaves us with the question of why he wants to make the workers worse off?My understanding here is that Piketty considers the perils of wealth inequality to be greater than the perils of a lower than possible standard of living for the average worker. I am not sure I agree with that but this is of course a matter of opinion and opinions can justly differ. However to be slightly uncharitable for a moment I think that some of the supporters of this argument are doing so precisely because they well know that outcome of optimal taxation theory that you shouldnt tax capital. It simply grates too much to be told on efficiency grounds that we shouldnt be taxing the plutocrats in their gilded castles. Thus some other almost any other argument must be found to justify such taxation.

11789322,0,t3_684na3,Eh I think thats just the politically safe position at this point. Not that Biden only holds that position for political reasons its definitely possible that he genuinely believes that but its a pretty easy position to have. I dont think it says much in relation to libertarianism since libertarians are fairly split on abortion.,Libertarian,dgwcy1x,1,t5_2qh63

11797103,0,t1_dgvfinw,I respect the property of others for several reasons none of which involve taxes  I want them to respect my property rights.  When property rights are not clear I do my own research to clarify them and that often involves merely observing.  My respect for the property of others causes them to use that property which is ultimately beneficial to me.  Many people are highly capable of defending their property without any reliance on any taxation Im one of them.In fact those who use taxation in order to defend their own property rights have weakened rights in my view.  After all they are relying on a system which has taken from me what I earned without my consent.  The system puts them in danger of suffering the disrespect that I and many others may show them as a result of their reliance on taxes.I do not lack faith in human beings.  Government indoctrination camps put a lot of effort into teaching people that man is a wolf to man.  Life experience has shown me otherwise.  Im .  There are a few people who lack compassion and any sense of cooperation but they are rare.  As a result I believe that most people agree with what I have written above if and when they introspect enough.,Libertarian,dgx8pvx,3,t5_2qh63

11809881,0,t1_dgyblm1,Well yeah I believe that taxes are theft but necessary? Kind of.  I believe that a government will always be inevitable and coalesce into the form of rule that we have today.  Therefore since government is inevitable then taxes must also be inevitable but that still means taxation is a form of coercion by the government and should be recognized as such.,Libertarian,dgyovwu,1,t5_2qh63
11810387,0,t1_dgypdag,This is a well laid out argument but I believe there are many flaws to it especially in modern times.gt Most of the great innovators in history operated without benefit of copyright lawsCopyright laws have not always been needed.  Back when ancient philosophers and writers created their texts most people didnt even know how to read let alone plagiarise text for profit.  However there are modern corporations today that almost definitely would steal intellectual property of it meant a nice profit.gt Masterpieces are all adaptations and improvements of stories written by othersIntellectual property does not cover stories and fables and so of course you are allowed for example to publish a book about a historical King.  Trying to restrict this would be unenforceable.  Intellectual property laws stop people stealing published works wordforword.gt Consider the hundreds of thousands of articles uploaded onto the Internet by their authors everyday available to anyone in the world for freeOnline articles and books are not the same thing.  If you want to write an article to be accessed for free with the knowledge that someone might steal it you are free to do so.  As you are giving it away for free you are exchanging your labor for nothing which is perfectly acceptable.  However books are sold for profit by the author and so stealing its contents is effectively taking the rewards from another persons labor which was never given out for free.  The two are not comparable.gt Nearly all works written before  are in the public domain yet pre works are still published and still sellI fail to see the relevancy of a point like this maybe someone will be able to help me out.  Obviously if a book is not bound by copyright people can publish it the author is dead.  If itsin the public domain do what you want with it no one is disputing that.  However this doesnt mean that more books should be put into the public domain.  I think the worry with public domain books currently isnt that of publisher rivalry but rather that customers wont want to buy a book thats hundreds of years old.gt British authors had no copyright protection under American law yet they received royalties from American publishers nonetheless.Im glad that publishers were like this it makes for a very honest deal.  It is beneficial both to the author because of the money but also the publisher because if they scam all of their authors authors will stop coming to them and they will run out of new books.  However in the modern age where all books are already online we cannot be sure whether people would simply steal texts if given the option.  This is why copyright law is most important now more than ever.,Libertarian,dgyqyb9,2,t5_2qh63
