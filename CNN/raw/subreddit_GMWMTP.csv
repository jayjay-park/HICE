1679600,0,t1_cjqksf9,DUDE! omg! I just had a CRAZY! idea.. ok so Jace is cursed blah blah blah right? ok so he had heard about an old crazy hermit living in dominaria who used to be killer with time magicben kenobi style. he meets up with Teferi and together they work the magic of the time bubble. the rest of my story happens as such only this.. as the shadow of Jace begins to win against our beloved time mage his body heats up and suddenly he feels that rush of mana.. his now malformed spark reignites! leading into the new planeswalker version of him BAM! he blasts the shadow into a different time and plane. ,GMWMTP,cjqvjqz,1,t5_32pxb
