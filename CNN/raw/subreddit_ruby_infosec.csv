4341684,0,t3_36k9gk,Hello Im the maintainer of Ronin. Work has really cut into my Open Source time. In addition there isnt really much interest in Ronin or willingness to contribute to it. I had a bunch of different ideas but no one seems interested and I dont have the time to pursue them. However the gem should still work.Although Im happy to see this subreddit exists. Back when I was developing Ronin there wasnt a Ruby amp InfoSec scene and everyone was heavily pushing Python as the one true InfoSec language its an ok language but the idea of a standardized language is silly in the age of PolyGlot.,ruby_infosec,csf1e33,3,t5_36wcy
