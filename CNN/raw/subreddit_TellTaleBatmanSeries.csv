9470638,0,t3_5agc4j,Ah interesting. The Batman Telltale series is my first of these types of games Ive loved it! This has been a difficult choice for me. I want to play it half my own personal choices and half of what I think Batman would do this of course completely subjective to what kind of Batman you want to emulate haha. My gut was to go with Selina but I feel like Batman would have saved Harvey. ,TellTaleBatmanSeries,d9ggmfp,3,t5_3b5cn
