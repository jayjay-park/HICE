It made it easier to tell whats going on while still creating some uncertainty and tension and it helped to convey the fact that MC has secrets and emotional blocks and stalker is having a lot of feelings about the stalking and is actually pretty trustworthy... I reckon try it if nothing else itll add to the word count and you can always delete it in December ,nanoprep,d8esp5v,1,t5_3ftey
