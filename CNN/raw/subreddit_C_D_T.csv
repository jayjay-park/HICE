10147679,0,t1_dbu7s20,Youre welcome Im built to just answer honest questions of this nature.  I dont even stop to question it and it comes out pure in return.  Sometimes I say things in this manner that really surprise even me but I try not to stop and think about it too much until done.  Im learning to go back and clean up my language afterwards too.  Heck yesterday it even occurred to me that I might be writing a book live on CST in some ways.Now just seeing a single  is an instance.  Seeing it twice in  minutes?  Pattern possibility but still let it go.  The third time though...youll know it might matter.  Thats the point where I would sort of PostIt mentally.The thing is over years of wandering through patterns it got to a point where it may as well be a bell inside clinging or clanging.  Theres a quality to observing things that comes where the moment stands out for some reason but you have no reason in the moment for it to be standing out.  I call this a Golden Moment.Golden Moments stand out and glow much like a memory can...but its now not then.  In time the Golden Moment takes on meaning and you find yourself thinking back to it for this reason often finding new details and clues in the memory that made no sense when it was collected.  The best way Ive ever thought to explain it to myself I dont talk this much in recent years so thanks is that you yourself charge that moment...but from your own future.Whoah.  I just realized it can have a name.Premembering.WHOAH.,C_D_T,dbu8u8o,2,t5_3eskg

11087727,0,t3_5ybsjo,Seriously as a kid The Cars opened the world of rock up to me and with such weird sounds thrown in!  I was forever changed by this band...and Devo.  Found them both about the same time.  Listening to CandyO now and its way wilder than I remember.  Looking forward to the others later too.  Lots of stuff to do at this terminal right now.,C_D_T,deos8lf,1,t5_3eskg
