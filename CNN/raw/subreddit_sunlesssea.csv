Do you think that means the Mountain was birthed in the Neath that it was sent there after its birth or that it came along with the Bazaar? If the Mountain was birthed in the Neath wouldnt that have more or less hidden her existence from the Judgements who cant enter the Neath?

3584454,0,t1_cq0uqb8,When an enemy got close to you it triggered a battle and a box appeared with a picture of your ship to the left and a picture of the foe on the right. Then you had several options according to your equipment but the basic ones where flare and scout which made the illumination meter of the foe go up and yours a tiny bit if you used flare you needed certain illumination level to use skills for example I think it was  maybe? to shoot  salvo which made damage to their life meter. There was also a flee skill which had a chance to fail I think it also depended on illumination as less illumination on you  more chance to flee. Enemies did the same to you. All this was accompanied by effects a la Hearthstone when the cards use skills on the others. It was a bit annoying specially when I was transporting TombColonists to make my starting few echoes and the goddamn zeebats wouldnt let me zail in peace I prefer our current battle system Yeah I saw the thing and it moved slowly thought I could diverge my course a bit apparently it wasnt enough and the thing noticed me turned and charged at me so fast I couldnt almost react.

3758202,0,t3_33ex3d,On a very basic level prioritise spending on fuel and supplies  and pick up a port report from each island you visit you can turn these in at the Admiralty for fuel and echoes. Reports alone can cover your expenses if you dont do anything crazy just visit a decent number of unique ports each time you head out. Start to do quests where you can the Salt Lions are a nice place to start if you can find them.Combat is generally best avoided unless you know you wont take significant damage  switch off your lights if you want to go unnoticed and boost away if necessary.To avoid excess resource consumption dont trade to a highpowered engine until you can afford the higher fuel consumption and dont fill your crew above .There are comprehensive guides around and the wiki is nice  but they can detract from the exploration aspect of the game.

6199815,0,t3_40hjqc,I think you are missing the point on a very high level. Sunless Sea is about the journey not necessarily the destination. Its also old school in that the game doesnt hold your hand through everything. There are wrong choices that will drastically impact the game with little to no warning.Youre going to be really upset once you realize many of the quests can be failed some very early on so you can literally miss out on hours of quests by making incorrect choices.,sunlesssea,cyucpcs,6,t5_2yok9
6208904,0,t3_40hjqc,gt First of all I am seriously missing a fastforward button... Am I missing something?First and most importantly Sunless Sea is a mood piece.  Its not entirely or even primarily about game mechanics so much as its about the stories and the atmosphere of the game.That may translate into boring as fuck or so compelling you have dreams about it according to your personal inclinations but its a very important thing to realise about the game.Everything is designed to craft an atmosphere of unease mystery and tension  from the graphics and music to the slow speed of your ship as you inch from port to port praying you wont run out of fuel or supplies that you wont get jumped by a powerful enemy etc etc.  The absence of events or the potential for events to happen is as important to the experience as the actual events themselves.If youre missing a fast forward button then Id suggest youre approaching the game with the wrong frame of mind  its akin to asking why an action movies has all these boring explosions in it that stop the plot moving forward or why a mystery novel doesnt just straightup tell you whodunnit after the first few pages  its a cliche but its about the journey not the destination.You can try tackling it from that perspective or maybe the game just isnt for you  theres no right or wrong answer there just personal preference. gt Furthermore clarity.Again this is intentional.  It can be frustrating and unnerving at first but thats the point  its trying to quote Futurama to make you feel ways about stuff.Youre supposed to be setting sail on an unknown sea full of unknown dangers and only vaguely aware of what youre doing and how everything works.Sometimes the game takes it too far its wilfully obtuse about game mechanics and that combined with permadeath is a pretty harsh lesson for beginners but to be fair they do warn new players that your first few captains are supposed to die.  In fact there are even aspects of the game that are only possible to find and play through if youve previously lost at least one captain before your current one.Game mechanics are picked up fairly quickly over the first few hours playing.  Situationalplot awareness what is X forwhere can I get X requires either you experiment and risk dying if youre a hardcore player or cheat and consult the wikiAlternatively someone posted a mod a while ago that adds an ingame item designed to give you hints and prompts without overtly spoiling the game or making it too easy  might be worth a look.gt A logbookInteresting idea  it would definitely help you to learn the game faster.  Equally some things about the world and plot... change from one captain to the next so it would have to be done carefully to ensure it didnt end up containing misleading or incorrect information on second and subsequent playthroughs.gt learning curve. Why start every game in iron man mode?Thats a valid point.  I suspect its another thing thats supposed to discourage you from savescumming and coerce you into iron man  permadeath  constant uneasy tense paranoia without which the game loses some of its flavour but its definitely a personal taste thing and I can see how you might feel judged by the game if you gave away your Invictus token.gt P.S. Why no more mod support wtf.The devs told everyone how the game used JSON files and how they were eager to see what people did with them then provided exactly no way to package up or distribute them let alone install multiple mods at the same time.Then after a few months when theyd rather missed the boat the released an update that made it easier to mod some aspects of the game but also missed a whole bunch of stuff out eg custom graphics and some badlyfactored JSON that made it impossible to modify existing shops without entirely replacing them... and when they were approached with suggestions and enquiries about the chances of fixing those things they basically said they were busy with the expansion back and had no plans to work on SS modding any time soon.Honestly I suspect either just didnt care much about modding they did care but managed to rather miss the boat hah! and only rolled out lacklustre modtools long after most people had given up or SS didnt do quite as well as theyd hoped and they had to cut their losses and focus on the expansion pack to try to stimulate more interest in the game.

6318305,0,t1_cz7rhh0,I have seen LornFlukes before but I havent engaged them so far as Ive been quite early in my game and was scared shitless when I saw that  HP OId rather avoid using the wiki as this is pretty much the only game I play these days and Id get bored if I dont spend time discovering stuff on my own The thing about stats is that I havent even come close to . Im trying to save my secrets because Ive had situations where I really needed them for something Irem for example the Soothe longbox thing or some officers questlines.The best ship Ive ever had was the merchant one. I used it for quite a while until I decided I no longer need that much cargo hauled from place to place and downgraded to the corvette. I had a ton of fun with the Memento Mori it was fast and deadly and allowed me to engage monsters  pirates easily and get some loot The problem is I can see no way to get the ship after the merchant one at the moment. This is what Im currently using with my new captain.I stumbled upon a very lucrative route of coffee selling at that surface place but after several times it wasnt possible anymore and I was left with like  coffee thingies in my cargo . Most echoes Ive had was around k was missing about k more for the better ship not including some echoes for supplies  fuel.Now on each port I arrive at I take note and write down the prices of everything and try and find maybe I could just trade stuff around and earn a bit of money,sunlesssea,cz7tk9q,1,t5_2yok9
6469931,0,t1_cznycjw,After emptying the Salt Lions its worthwhile to enter the sunlight trade. It requires a bit of money to start because you have to buy empty mirrocatch boxes for e apiece in Khans Shadow.  Then carry them to the surface via the Cumaean Canal fill up all the boxes and sell the light to the blind bruiser for e. This returns an empty box to you ready for another trade run. It costs a lot of fuel to go up to the surface and back but if you carry a few mirrorcatch boxes with you it becomes very profitable. The downside is that like the Salt Lions this is also a temporary trade route. Eventually youll go mad with desire for the light and start opening the boxes in your hold. This causes a wound each time you open a box in addition to wasting the cargo so its no longer safe to carry sunlight after that point. Fortunately you can make many runs to the surface and earn a tidy fortune before sunlight desire becomes a problem.,sunlesssea,czojc34,3,t5_2yok9

8171016,0,t3_4r7aqm,In reverse order.  If you read this sort of thing you are likely to encounter spoilers obviously. The game has changed substantially several times since its first release.  A lot of info online is wrong.  It is rather like Pillars of Eternity in this respect.  Suggested courses of action ways to make money etc. mentioned in old online posts are often completely incorrect now or wont make any sense.. The thread you linked is a year old not sure what that means on Reddit so its hard to say about updates since that thread.  There was an update in July . Not sure about since other than a very minor one in October . I think the Rose Market was added in January  it does not appear in that list of content and patches for some reason.. As to the main point  SS is a very unusual game.  Its closest relatives are Han Solo type space games like Escape Velocity where you have a ship a cargo hold upgrades of various kinds and you explore go on missions and buy and sell stuff and sometimes get into fights with other ships or monsters in this case.  But it has pretty critical resource management of several resourcesexpenses fuel supplies Terror crew money needed to keep the ship running.  It has no difficulty setting.  The more you know about the mechanics and the world the easier it gets by far.  You cant turn down the difficulty at the start nor can you turn it up later. The result is that the game is incredibly difficult at the beginning of your play experience with it which puts a lot of people off.  If you know what you are doing on the other hand the game is fairly easy and it becomes about exploring all the storieswinning Ambitions.  Once you have some money to your name you only die if you were taking a chance and you knew it.  Money solves almost all problems in the game.  You start with almost none which is the major hurdle to survival. The initial hump is bypassed by some people because they got very lucky in their initial map setup or their random and unknowing choices which let them stumble upon some money early on which takes most of the pressure off.  So you will see wildly varying reports from people about their first five hours of the game. Editing the save file to give yourself extra money is an easy way to crank the difficulty way down. Many people including me consider SS to be a wiki game.  Trying to just play it straight with no outside sources of information is likely to be a frustrating experience and you will miss a lot of content besides. Some people do play it straight.  Naturally they literally do not know what they are missing.  If you try to play it straight you will probably need to take detailed notes as you go along regarding quest requirements what is bought and sold and for how much at various ports etc. because there is no ingame way to check on this kind of info. Your Journal might say bring item X to location Y but when you get to Y you will discover you also need item Z and you will have to go all the way back or to some third location to get one.  The games excellent wiki can head off a lot of this kind of aggravation which just feels like a trick to extend gameplay. Unlike most RPGs an extra trip to get item Z is not just a waste of ten minutes it can eat a lot of precious fuel and supplies so it is more than an inconvenience.   The games default mode is Merciless Mode aka Iron Man in most games where there is just one autosave and if you die thats it. For some strange reason a lot of people buy into this and play the game this way get frustrated and quit the game without ever just using the usual save and reload technique that most people use in most RPG type games. Maybe it is the psychological warfare the game uses to discourage this you start off with an Invictus Token named after the poem of the same name with a mouseover text about being the master of your fate and the captain of your soul and you lose this token not just for this captain but for all future captains in the same lineage if you create a manual save.  The token has no gameplay effect it is there purely to make you feel like a wimp for using manual saves.  Also creating a manual save switches the game to Merciful Mode which is not exactly a heroic description of you and your captains  oh please game be merciful to me!  Not flattering.  So people get bamboozled into playing in Iron Man mode which they probably would not do in any other RPG game that they were trying for the first time and get fed up as they die over and over trying to learn the game which means repeating a lot of early game content over and over.  The simple solution is to ignore the Invictus and Merciful stuff and just make manual saves at various ports and reload when you feel like it like you would any other long RPG game.  A lot of the gaming wounds you read out there are selfinflicted by people thinking they are playing a roguelike.  This is not a roguelike.  I play in Merciless Mode now for more of a challenge but I also know the game really well and certainly did not do that with my first captains. There is a mod available on Steam called the Easy Mode Mod which slows down the rate of supply and fuel consumption speeds up your ship and lowers the time required before you can do certain things at ports. Docking without a Something Awaits You is a typical new player blunder which can be costly.  I used this mod for quite a while and it definitely takes some of the relentless pressure off the early game when you are struggling to get enough money to keep buying fuel and supplies.    The game is also unusual in that a lot of mechanics concern passing things on to future captains.  Death or retirement or winning does not end the game it ends that captains career but you then immediately start a new captain who can inherit a lot of stuff including personal attributes and can start better off than the last one.  This can take the sting out of dying.  In fact certain content is only available if you have had at least one captain die in your current lineage.  Also there is a lot of cool content that only occurs if things are going badly  the go insane eat your crew type stuff is something you will never see if you play conservatively cheat or otherwise make things too easy on yourself. So there is an upside to getting pummeled by the game a bit  you will get to see some amusing stories you otherwise would not.  Getting pummeled early on when you havent invested much time in that captain is probably less painful than losing a captain who has a really nice ship crew and equipment.  In the latter case you could just you know reload. So as long as you arent the rage quitter type its probably worth getting killed a few times early on so you can see the amusing choices and flavor text from things going down the toilet.The games strengths are well known.  The setting is unique and there is a lot of background lore from the browser game Fallen London which you can either learn from playing that or reading it on lore sites.  The art is really cool.  The writing is top notch and the stories are unforgettable.  The pacing of the game with the tiny ship crawling its way through a huge hostile dark sea supplies dwindling Terror rising everyone glancing nervously at the fuel gauge tends to be polarizing you either love it or hate it.  If you are an impatient action gamer you will likely hate it.  Personally I find it a very cool world to sail around in and explore and the atmosphere is very appealing. It is very satisfying and nerve wracking to avoidescape sea monsters that are bigger than your ship and later on when you have a bigger ship hunt them instead for the treasures of the sea.Also if you are a fan of the authors Patrick OBrian Jack Vance or H.P. Lovecraft this game is for you.   In sum it is not a perfect game but it is refreshing unique and something innovative and new.  How often does that come along in todays gaming world?  There is nothing else like it and for that reason alone I am willing to overlook its problems and enjoy all it has to offer. Ive spent about  hours playing it.  Well worth the purchase.  ,sunlesssea,d4yxd1d,29,t5_2yok9

9290729,0,t3_57oqgq,Well SMEN is the SMEN of Sunless Sea because you can pursue it at least to some extent through Unaccountably Peckish and the lessons of the Chapel of Lights. You can even get your head lopped off if you complete St Gawains lesson although you wont obtain any candles so youre not truly Seeking.There are parallels between Salt and Eaten particularly in the Salt path of the SMEN storyline proper which are difficult to fully understand without more information and yes it seems unlikely that both of them having sevenlettered names and losing their identity in some way Salt by building Frostfound out of his memories and going east Eaten by being sacrificed by the GodKings and becoming some kind of horrifying unthing that only truly exists in Parabola is a coincidence.You also have to give up your chiefest possessions in both Winking Isle for SMEN and Irem for Salts Song.,sunlesssea,d8to078,5,t5_2yok9

9831596,0,t3_5fxa53,from utreadwheel  found here gtDahut  Dahut is actually pretty complex in how the two counters interact and it took me a pretty long time to get anything done. Basically youll do various things that will raise Clarity which helps you see the true nature of Dahut and Enthrallment which envelops you in the illusion and lets you interact more and more with the drownies. The big mechanic here will be collecting songs from Dahut and one from Wrack as well as trading Scintillack to the Fathomking for White Mollyflower. The Wrack song and Mollyflower have some very profound effects on your Clarity and Enthralled which you can use to confound the drownies. Basically to start work on finding ways to boost your Enthralled higher and higher in order to get invited to various festivals and events. Once there youll need to pass checks usually Clarity ones in order to collect information about whats really going on there and importantly to collect the Drownie songs which youll use on subsequent visits to boost Enthralled and Clarity even further. Once youve figured out that much its a lot less confusing. Think of it as sort of a puzzle. Also hint The Drownie Song in Counterpoint is going to be key in another port. You can get it more than once so make sure you get it and carry it with you.,sunlesssea,dap2u4c,1,t5_2yok9
