6422839,0,t3_43kwgp,If you can provide them Ill gladly plug the stats in.  I was using Ariyalas stat weights which are basically zero so I just threw them in the same pile as PLDWAR.  A stupid assumption but its all I could find even after googling.This is how its setup I can split DRK off into its own stat weight array.  If I didnt include a Defense stat weight lates PLDs would have Linen Trousers  def weighted over Boarskin Breeches  def.Alternatively If you can provide a X is showing up but Y is really better kind of thing I could tweak it that way too,ffxivcrafting,czjnp5x,1,t5_32p0a
