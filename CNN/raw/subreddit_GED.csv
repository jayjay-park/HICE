8940433,0,t1_d7mhjgy,I dont think the essay is that important really. You have to remember the passing score is relatively low you only need to get about  of the questions right. The answers are in the articles a few of them are simple questions and  of them were strangely enough simple math questions like mean and median. If I can do it Im pretty sure anyone can do it. Dont bother tripping yourself up studying for a test you can probably pass considering in a couple states like NC theyll give  free retakes anyways. Better to fail and get a general idea of where you are than to study for  months and pass lol. ,GED,d7miawq,1,t5_2qqvb
10257614,0,t3_5mq1gq,There was no questions is which date memorization was required. It was  reading comprehension and charts data analysis. It was the my highest score of all the sections  and one of two sections I didnt do a lick of studying for. It was the easiest section IMO.I cant stress enough though that the practice tests on GED.com give you a very good idea of how you will score on the actual exam.  I either scored just above or well above my practice test scores on the actual GED. If you can pass those youre ready for the real thing.,GED,dc6r9ao,3,t5_2qqvb
