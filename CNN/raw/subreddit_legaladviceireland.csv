9250453,0,t1_d85j733,Apologies for the delay in getting back to you only seeing your reply now. There should be a single address specified for the company address. The form should have seperate space for the company address and the addresslocation where activity will be carried out and it should ask you to verify these separately. If in doubt give the cro a call and ask them to check with the New Companies Unit that everything is ok. It sounds like the address may be specified incorrectly on the form but they are usually fairly good at spotting obvious mistakes and contacting filers for clarificationrectification.,legaladviceireland,d8ok8zk,1,t5_3ccax
10599684,0,t1_dd99jnj,Hi thanks for your response.I did get a physical receipt on purchase of the phone but Im a total eegit and I cannot find it. I have reached out to the seller to try get proof of purchase from them like a screenshot of their bank statement from then but they havent responded.As far as them not giving a technical breakdown I was on the phone to the chap who was looking after it and he told me flat out that they turned the phone on and once they saw in the top left that the Knox counter was tripped they stuck it back in the box and said the warranty was void. No further work was done on it according to him.Its a Galaxy Note  autofocus issue.,legaladviceireland,dd99y65,1,t5_3ccax
