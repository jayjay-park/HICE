10172075,0,t1_dbtl01y,they are from Scenegruppen another group like Kosegruppen which basically has the job of building and setting up the stage before the performance. They are singing about the different stuff they do hammering screwing building and painting. In norwegian the word for painting is the same as the word for purring the cat noise so thats what the cat stuff is about. ,skam,dbx2735,3,t5_3ckh3
10173021,0,t1_dbx5qhj,Season  was binge worthy. Season  was half binge worthy and season  isnt binge worthy for one reason.Isak.,skam,dbx624p,1,t5_3ckh3

10252806,0,t3_5mrcn2,Perhaps Jonas would be understandably mad but I think it would be irrelevant from a story perspective to bring it up now. What makes Skam so good is how certain events are such a big deal to certain characters but not a blip on other characters radar. For example Evas world ends when Jonas founds out she cheated on him but its old news by the time we get to Noora and Isak seasons because it doesnt mean as much to them. ,skam,dc67mwj,2,t5_3ckh3
10270324,0,t1_dc84ts4,Well Thomas Hayes who played William quit the show so there really cant be a relationship to follow. And the whole purpose of Skam is to really focus on one character and we as viewers get to follow their lives around see their text messages see them struggle behind closed doors and its these individual season of focusing on one character that makes Skam so unique and different from any other show. I think the purpose of not seeing the other relationships of the other characters once the focus is shifted onto another character when the season changes is to show that everyones lives move on without everyone noticing and thats why we dont see Nooras relationship because she moved on with her life and now it was time to focus on someone elses.,skam,dc874cm,6,t5_3ckh3

10495414,0,t1_dcmf62k,Right? It didnt use to and now its becoming quite common. I think its great.Also I thought no one else in Portugal knew Skam even existed,skam,dcxrkhe,1,t5_3ckh3
10605050,0,t1_dd8wles,. I think Vilde is more common than Noora as a Noora is designed to be more of a hipsterish girl I guess. But yhea style is more important than practicality here which is silly since it gets absolutely ice cold during the winter haha.. Spanish French and German is the normal languages you can start to learn from middle school and up English starts as soon as we begin school. In High School depending on the school you can learn Japanese Arabic Latin and a few other major ones.. One . L glass of beer costs about  dollars in a bar and a shot is usually around  dollars so yhea its way expensive but tbh personally I just find it funner with home parties than going out clubbing.. Kebab is insanely popular here in my little city of  people we even have our own kebab shop in my neighboring town which is a bit bigger there are literally always atleast one kebab shop in your line of sight its probably more popular than MacDonalds here. What can I say kebab is really fucking good.,skam,dd9tw3m,5,t5_3ckh3

11223095,0,t1_df3unea,Yes. The geoblocking is due to music industry copyright issues.However EU is working on a proposal to outlaw all geoblocking and that would include Norway. How that would work out for viewers outside EUEEA I dont know.,skam,df44h1g,3,t5_3ckh3
11495000,0,t1_dfx8abw,Why did you get pissed off? She was hiding it I thought it was clever of her to do because no teacher would ask her to take it off and yes it WAS funny to me. Why did it make you angry?,skam,dfyyh63,4,t5_3ckh3
11560520,0,t1_dg60icy,I too wanted at least a Vilde season in addition to Sanas who Ive always wanted for S but I think the worldwide pressure on Julie Andem and the cast is overwhelming. Its a case of being victim of its own success.,skam,dg6e11c,4,t5_3ckh3
11568970,0,t1_dg78dkh,Idk probably if you fall in love with someone who is a firm believer? But yeah conversionbecoming religious is really hard to grasp for somebody like me whos alternating between agnosticism and atheism. I just dont get the concept. I wouldnt ask as bland as Isak does but yeah Im more or less asking myself the same.,skam,dg7cjsi,10,t5_3ckh3

11763527,0,t1_dgspa1z,I agree with some of these things but Im not sure about others.I think Sana and Even are both keeping it a secret because they dont want to upset IsakGiven the look Sana gives Even when he and Isak leave I dont think shes happy to be hiding Evens secret. And I think Even is hiding it out of shame not because he doesnt want to upset Isak.She also knows Even needed a fresh start so she is trying her best to stay away from their drama.I do think shes trying to stay away from their drama but Im not sure she thinks whatever happened at Elvebakken really merits a fresh start. She had to think a bit about what Even was afraid she and Isak had discussed its not at the forefront of her mind when shes in Evens presence. I think whatever happened she doesnt see it as a huge a deal as Even does. ,skam,dgtfbaq,3,t5_3ckh3
11776608,0,t3_67xmb7,Came across the show on some kind of a Torrent site after reading the introduction decided to give it a try. I watched season first.,skam,dguwza4,2,t5_3ckh3
11803453,0,t1_dgxy98d,What she went through was traumatic. When people talk about others sometimes they are talking about themselves. She dealt with Nico in spectacular badass fashion in the moment but now its  months later and shes moved to a new country. She has moved on and when she says it brought all of the Nico stuff back up for William shes also saying that this brought all of the Nico stuff back up for her. And I dont think her storyline which involved rape for a chunk of her episodes before being ruled out is just white people problems x.Im really not on board with all of the Noora hate Im seeing this season.,skam,dgxynmg,22,t5_3ckh3
