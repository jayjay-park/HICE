1549557,0,t1_cjagwhk,I dont think doing a  miler or a k is a big deal at all. I never understood why everyone had such a boner for progressing through the ranks. Youll do fine. Like uChurchofMadness says if shit hits the fan just keep moving. Just dont stop and sit down and rest at an aid station because youre not gonna feel better! Just keep moving. Guys will often literally walk   of a  miler and still finish well under the cutoff.,Ultramarathon,cjaidwq,3,t5_2rpg3
1877407,0,t1_ckff2dy,No no I saw it over in rrunning and figured that the ultra sub might be interested. Full credit goes to uuberlegit for posting it originally. I guess my original title should have stated that it was a xpost as well. Mistakes were made.,Ultramarathon,ckff5mg,2,t5_2rpg3
2228221,0,t3_2km4oy,Trail Runner Nation podcast and community is amazing. I listened to probably  episodes before my first ultra and I felt like a pro. Don and Scott the hosts get amazing guests and you really start to get to know them. Im especially a fan during my long commute and on long runs when I want to focus on something other than my running. Highly highly recommend. Pick a few episodes that sound good based on the title and then dive in I found it because I was looking for Scott Jurek interviews for example,Ultramarathon,cln264k,2,t5_2rpg3

Having your account and the account you used to create this thread sign up within an hour of each other and only post in this one thread makes it obvious.  Next time you do this youll want to make the fake account a week or two ahead of time and throw in some dummy posts so it looks like the account is real.,Ultramarathon,cnljvjk,10,t5_2rpg3

3266537,0,t1_cp0eu78,Cheers ujeckles Thats rad youre looking into this Maffetone running approach more. I dont know any specific coaches who follow this method other than Mark Allen and Dr. Phil Maffetone. Have you asked Mark Allen and his team if hes able to work with you only on the running part worth a try?Maffetone didnt include any training plans in his books because he wants you to listen to your body and based on your own progress or lack off you adjust your training. For example if you only run aerobic for several months and continue to see good progress with your monthly MAF tests you can keep doing what youre doing. If you stop progressing or go backwards you should analyze if there are factors like stress lack of sleep upcoming sickness etc that hold you back. If thats not the case then adding intervals    x a week    minutes max    weeks total is what he recommends. Then every now and then a shorter weekend race is totally fine. This is how I currently train for Boston and it works well for me. Maybe its an idea for you to reread his Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing and create your own training schedule and adjust when needed. Cheers! ,Ultramarathon,cp0m1cd,3,t5_2rpg3
3310807,0,t1_cp5lavw,Definitely possible! I raced a hard  miler sick last November and have run with a woman who could barely speak because of a sore throat in a  mile race...she ran hard too!,Ultramarathon,cp5nr8i,1,t5_2rpg3
3425408,0,t1_cpiaew0,It was definitely easier this year.  We got to slowly build up to the Coosa peak where as in  runners go from  feet to  in less than  miles. I ran it last year so I remembered the trails we skipped in the beginning this year and really wished we were on those instead of the muddy Forrest roads for the first  miles. The second have was nice. The DRT was a bear. I was luck enough to finish is th place so the downhills on the DRT were still manageable but I heard from those that finished earlier it became very slick. ,Ultramarathon,cpipzo0,1,t5_2rpg3

8146085,0,t1_d4vpawo,I feel like its standard operating procedure to know what to not do and then do it anyways in an ultra because it seemed logical at the time. I wont give him any shit for it because I make the mistake nearly every race in one way or another. Sometimes it just works...but other times...not so much. ,Ultramarathon,d4vt2eo,5,t5_2rpg3
8254882,0,t1_d58myal,I need to try these out! Other people have recommended them to me before. I have been using applesauce packets to break up the monotony of the gels but I think Id like to try out the baby food. Can you recommend a brand and some favorite flavors? I have a huge issue eating solid food during an ultra I just have a huge problem chewing itswallowing it even before any nausea sets in. I often limit myself to aid station fruits potatoes and soups. Anything with a high water content. I think the baby food would be perfect for me to get in more calories.,Ultramarathon,d59f0k5,1,t5_2rpg3

8799454,0,t1_d75d1e0,Well I think thats definitely part of it. The other reason why I tend to not notice a difference is really because of how I approach both races. When I run a  miler Im pushing pace a lot harder than a . Similarly as to why marathons tend to be harder on my body than a  because of the tempo of which Im racing them. The time on youre feet definitely adds a cumulative element however by the next day in both a  and a  mile races Im not even sore and the biggest difference that Ive noticed is just my overall energy level and how hungry I am. The first couple days after a  it seems like no matter how much I eat I cant curb my hunger which I never really got that in a  mile race. That being said If you race a  just like you race a  miler and cut the pace down a ton Im sure you could come out of the  not as banged up as a  miler. Also it has a lot to do with terrain obviously a mountain  could put you in a lot more discomfort than a easy rolling . ,Ultramarathon,d75kovn,1,t5_2rpg3

10345604,0,t3_5nt8hn,My biggest thing was finding something i could stomach and enjoyed. Its amazing how difficult it can become when the food you try to eat is really dry or takes a long time to chew. Or if its overly sweet etc. but  to  calories per hour is quite easy to do. I went through lots of gels finding some that i liked i take a few as emergency food because they still mostly taste like crap to me. I much prefer the chews they sell now. I think each pack is like  calories or so and they go down really easy for me. I got a lot of good information from the hammer website. If you dont use their products its still worth a read. It has figures for how many calories for your weight and how much sodium etc per hour too. Its a great starting point. I think they say that you can get away with just purely liquid diet. But i personally look forward to some kind of energy bar at some point during a long workout. But anyway to get to your question. I read that you had to take some calories in to help you burn the stored fats in your body. I always try to train the same as i intend to race. Its amazing how much different you will feel if you eat a little less or more. Keep some sort of diary take energy food with you and try run long without it. If you feel like crap then just take a gel or whatever and walk a mile until your good to go again. I guess training can be used to test yourself too. I wouldnt go out without food though just incase you bonk bad. Edit added some bits and tried to make more sense. ,Ultramarathon,dcgqeoa,2,t5_2rpg3
10379678,0,t3_5ok702,I guess Im what youd call a large volume drinker throughout a normal day.  I usually go to the sink and just fill a drinking glass with water and down it in one fell swoop  oz.  I probably drink   oz servings of water daily no I dont have the beetus.  I will also just drink straight from a two liter of diet soda and finish it in one sitting.However theres no way I would ever want to train at that consumption level.  Ill chug  glasses before I head out.  On a hot summer day I can budget a .L bladder for the duration of a  hour run.  It does cut it close at the end but after awhile you can tell about how much is left as you go.I feel like it would be much easier to train yourself to sustain with less vs. trying to carry all that extra weightbulk.  Dehydration wont be an issue as long as you drink plenty surrounding the training.With a bottle vest you could do the .L bladder plus two ish oz bottles and it wouldnt be too bad.
