272155,0,t3_1x7g96,Do what you want. I lost a mayorship once because the thief would upload Instagram pics that they had taken at location day or weeks prior. They were checking in once a day at weird times via the app. As such they stole the mayorship. I think this practice Ive shared is a little more sketchy than playing catchup. ,Foursquare,cf8ywsv,3,t5_2ro98
