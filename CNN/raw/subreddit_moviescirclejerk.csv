People would have looked at a film like that and said Sorry you want me to believe that that CGI animal can talk and has problems that resemble human problems? Im sorry no that is just too much for me to take I cannot suspend my disbelief long enough to enjoy such a wacky idea.And a talking tree?! Before this film any movie with a talking tree in it would have been laughed out of the theatre! Boy if you were going to put a talking tree into your movie you might as well have gone the whole hog and put in wizards and dwarves and elves because nobody was going to go and see it anyway!And its in space! Think about that! A movie set in motherfucking SPACE! Boy that would never have played in the past a crew of misfits flying around in a spaceship fighting evildoers? Boy how corny that would have seemed huh? People shooting lasers and talking to aliens? Crazy!

1999545,0,t1_ckrwmjt,Prometheus added a shitload to the series and was definitely a step up. The additional background information website timeline bonus footage and all that extra shit fleshed out much of the franchise. I had always wanted more from the franchise about the timeline species and universe in general and Prometheus brought that in drovers. There was still plenty of ambiguity rather than spelling shit out but when you look at the additional level of theories it helped usher in and all of the other information that we were given to fill in the gaps between the existing movies Alien became much more cohesive and epic than it had ever been before. It wasnt a perfect transition and obviously many people do not actually enjoy having to logically work out what they are seeing with what we have not seen. I personally loved the experience.Ive never been a huge fan of Finchers edition to the franchise but I really dont get all the hate on Resurrection. Maybe I am just overly gay for Whedons writing but I found it thoroughly enjoyable especially in contrast to Alien . It was a little over the top and obviously didnt sit well with a lot of people but I think the haterade is just a little too strong on this one.

3293074,0,t1_cp3li64,gt Barely. And when theyre ranked against other teenagery films it feels like teenagers vs. classic film fans. The IMDb  had this but at least classic films were more recognized. If the subreddit is based off films people will be discussing and upvoting their favorite films all the time so you can predict what will be on the list.I dont really get the versus argument doesnt it just mean the list is eclectic and includes a variety of cinema like any allencompassing list should? Of my personal top ten I have three films pre and four post that doesnt mean I have some internal conflict between liking classics and liking modern films it just means I like them both. Similarly the rmovies userbase likes both teenagery films and classics. Any list that essentially boils down to peoples favourite movies should include classics and modern films. No argument about being able to predict basically the entire list beforehand but I dont think that makes it any less worthwhile its essentially an easily accessible list to work off for someone new to rmovies or someone wanting a more comprehensive knowledge of the oftendiscussed films there. But Im speaking as a huge iCheckMovies fanboy so any list is good news for me.gt The IMDb  does a better job at this though. It has more variety and is commonly used by rmovies. Put it in the sidebar. As well its updated constantly instead of every year. Id even argue its more popular.Just because something does a better job doesnt mean that anything else similar is redundant. And I almost prefer the Reddit list to the IMDb  in terms of achieving what they seek out to do anyway but thats more personal preference I watched all of last years Reddit list although I was only missing like  films when it came out and I found it a very enjoyable experience particularly the second half of the list. I dont think being constantly updated is a good thing in this case as it results in any popular new release making the Top  almost immediately. I mean the bloody Imitation Game was on there for a while.gt The  million userbase will just lead to the worst of popularity contests. With a more controlled environment and a smaller film choice I personally find more films will get their opportunity and if discussions with the  are common obscure films can get their due as well. It may still be popularitybased but not nearly as much and can lead to a lot more variety and ranges of popularity. It probably is elitist but Id find rmovies mods deciding what their favorite French New Wave or Modern Action films are much more interesting than  million random people deciding on something thats been done to death.The point of the list is to be populist. Maybe there would be less controversy if it was called The  Most Popular Films On Reddit. Im fine with that as well part of the reason I like watching movies is that I like being able to discuss movies with other people and for better or worse the majority of people I discuss film with dont really give a shit about obscure French New Wave films. And if you think the IMDb list makes Reddits list redundant then doesnt the same logic apply to the countless lists of certain genres of classic films and the type of list youre proposing?gt Finally this might just come off as me talking out of my ass so correct me if Im wrong but I believe most rmovies users care more about getting validation for liking certain films than caring about every film on the list. And those who do care about every film on the list theyve probably already discovered another list that accomplishes that need for them. Again the much superior though still incredibly flawed IMDb Everyone likes having their opinion validated but again the same could be said of any list that is voted on by a lot of people. Its weird because a criticism often levelled at rmovies is that people are contrarian for the sake of being contrarian that seems to be the verdict on the recent dislike of Boyhood and Birdman for example so it feels strange to complain about people just wanting others to like films that they like. I think to the extent that this phenomenon is apparent in the list its just human nature and doesnt really influence the order of films.,moviescirclejerk,cp3my18,3,t5_2tfdo

3481835,0,t1_cpp0a9z,uj I want to go through each of your points one by one.Holloway took off his helmet due to his inner conviction in believing in scientific rationality over religiousness. He tells Shaw not to be a skeptic as he checked his equipment which specifically said the structure had a breathable atmosphere and was the result of the Engineers terraforming. It was also in part a matter of hubris with his whole One small step for Man thing in that he literally believes he is making history by being the first people to discover the origins of humanity so every small thing counts to make it unique and foolhardy with an act of bravado.They tried to revive the Engineers head via electrical stimulation because thats what Holloway wanted to talk to their creators and get their answers from them. The problem was it was already infected by the mutagen at the time and thus reactivating the head prompted the mutation to continue after it was halted through his decapitation. It only operates on a biological level with living beings hence why David was unaffected. It also serves as a parallel to Mary Shelleys Frankenstein with the monster being createdrevived through dead human body parts and having electricity course through its body or galvanism. Also they did manage to run a test and it was very revealing.The DNA of the Engineer wasnt a perfect match for humans all the computer says after the readout is DNA Match. There is never any mention of it being perfect or an  similarity just that their genes are biologically similar due to the fact the Engineers created humanity from their own DNA. Again Holloway wanted more than proof the Engineers existed he wanted a direct conversation with them asking what they hoped to achieve in creating humanity. He needed verbal confirmation of the why a talk with God essentially. What he got wasnt what he expected so he naturally was depressed that potentially the only link to uncovering humanitys purpose in the cosmos was lost. Weyland hid on his own ship because he wanted to obscure his agenda from Shaw and Holloway who would likely have tried to stop him from achieving his goal which is why outside of them the rest of the crew were merely hired to assume the facade of legitimacy for the board with the altruistic goal of finding humanitys creators when all he wanted was to extend his own lifespan and prevent his own death. The reason the med pod was only calibrated to male patients was because its Weylands ship and the device was for a surgical procedure to be performed on Weyland in case he was injured. Weyland didnt care about the rest of the crew or his daughter.Fifield was probably one of the shitty scientists Weyland hired to assume the facade of professionalism needed to convince his board to give him a trillion dollars to embark on his quest to extend his own life. If he had recruited actual scientists and not internet diploma morons the crew would have likely questioned the total lack of information they were given beforehand and pulled out from the mission. Fifield was motivated purely for monetary gain which tells us a lot about his priorities. Of course he would act like a dick hes not a real geologist.Also he didnt get lost per se its mentioned that the mapping pups are only used to coordinate the giant D composite in the pilot chamber aboard Prometheus which is then synced back to his internal device but due to the silica storm it disrupts the communication between the pups and Prometheus which is why their motion signals on the pyramid map tracked by the pups and the signal of the lone Engineer in hibernation are in flux and appear sporadically for Janek. As for Millburn I believe its due to his personal beliefs regarding the conflict between science and religion. Early on he is critical of Shaws faith in the Engineers creating humanity as going in the face of  centuries of Darwinism. And so when Shaws thesis is ostensibly confirmed by the presence of Engineer skeletons lying around its a matter of him not wanting to stand around and be proven wrong so he and Fifield leave and try to get back to the ship. But when they get lost in the labyrinthine tunnels of the pyramid which they have no way of actually finding their way through and Millburn finds the creature its like hes in his comfort zone and tries to take his mind off it. The reveal of Vickers as Weylands daughter is very significant on a thematic level as it refers to the creatorcreation dynamic present throughout the film. The film makes a point of saying that humanity was abandoned by the Engineers and left to its own devices due to a significant event  years ago and the fact Weyland considers himself a creator or a god makes this notable in that Vickers represents humanity being ostracised and abandoned by Weyland because he wanted a son. So he created and confided in an artificial entity named David as his true offspring. Which begs the question What did the Engineers confide in after abandoning humanity and wishing for its destruction? Probably Xenomorphs which makes the evolutionary trinity between the Engineers humans and Xenomorphs all linked with the Engineers as their common ancestor.David was given free reign across the ship because when everyone else was in hibernation David was essentially the ships caretaker and butler and so he was responsible for the ships maintenance during the two year trip to LV. He obviously knew every inch of the ship from top to bottom. As for why he fucked shit up that was the directive given by him from Weyland. To try harder. What his intentions were were finding out a means of prolonging Weylands life by any means necessary so the lives of the crew were intentionally forfeit for him to experiment on and jeopardise. This is why he spikes Holloways drink to uncover the properties of the Engineers biological mutagen when exposed to a human host and why he attempts to put Shaw into cryostasis to preserve the creature inside her for study based on its properties. I hope this provides some insight to the nature of your queries. uj,moviescirclejerk,cpp5kot,2,t5_2tfdo

3944496,0,t1_cr5sp9f,Yknow after reading all these Mad Max Fury Road reviews where nonfans complained about how feminist actiony and linear the film was its starting to seem like the deeper we go into these films the more exclusionary they are going to become to normal fans.The inclusion of deep cut Mad Max characters like Immortan Joe Toecutter or The Humungus just confuses these people. To them these characters seem really undeveloped or shallow but to fans the characters have already been very very meticulously developed so we dont really need any exposition to make sense of it. Almost as if the films were made specifically for us.When the film says Immortan Joe is going to Fury Road to get The Wives back from Imperator Furiosa. The normie says to himself What? Who? I have no idea who any of them are or why Immortan has a mask. While the fan says Yeah if Immortan wants to create fucked up children by impregnating his Wives and Furiosa is a wall in his plan he may want to hit up the War Boys since he needs an army to take down Max. Makes sense.Eventually were going to get to the point where the normies just dont care anymore because theyre too confused and dont want to do the homework Thats going to result in a drop off in the amount of money these films make. Theres still plenty of people out there who will go see these films and Im sure that will always justify spending twohundred million dollars on them so theyre always going to be around but theyre going to become a lot more like actual kinographies. Impenetrable for people who arent deeply immersed in this universe.You know what I say to that?GOOD.I dont care if normies are into this shit. I dont really want these characters to be massive ubiquitous SJW pulp culture phenomenons if that means we have to spend an entire film expositing to people who dont know whats going on.These kinographies should be made for the fans. People who arent hostile to the notion of an extended interconnected film universe that requires a familiarity with what has come before. Let the normies go back to watching sports or the Bachelor or whatever the fuck the were into before this stuff came along.If theyre tired of playing with the guzzoline and Mad Max figurines Ive been playing with since I was  then Ill take them back.

4085883,0,t3_37eddf,I have a very personal relationship with my lord and savior Christopher Nolan. Very personal. I met him three years ago at a bar in downtown Reno. I was hanging out with a few of my friends they were all getting shitfaced but unfortunately I was the designated driver.So I was just sitting there sipping on a glass of ice water. Then this Middle Eastern guy takes a seat next to me. Do you wanna see a really cool trick? he asked. I wasnt sure if he was hitting on me or not but I was bored off my ass so I said sure.Then he snapped his fingers and my water turned into wine. Christopher Nolan! I said. He grinned and said Yup thats my name. And if you play your cards right youll be screaming it all night long. You want to get into heaven you sexy little thing? Well let me put it this way...the only way to The Father is through me.Im not gay so I was feeling pretty awkward. But after a few shots of some holy spirits I started to loosen up. And it dawned on me that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I would become the first person in human history to bone Jesus who could pass that up? So I abandoned my friends and went back to his place.He lit some candles and put on some Christmas carols to set the mood. After a few glasses of sacramental wine I was ready to go. I tore his robes off and thrust my manhood inside him. The feeling was incredible it was like fucking three people at the same time. OH ME! he screamed in ecstasy. I HAVENT BEEN NAILED THIS HARD SINCE THE CRUCIFIXION! I blew my load pretty quickly but he wasnt done with me. He bent me over and whispered Are you ready to accept the body of Christ? He didnt even wait for answer he jammed his divine rod in my asshole and went to town. I was surprised at how fast he camebut then again he hadnt gotten laid in  years so I could see why. Well I thought he was finished. He rolled me over on my back and said Are you ready for the Second Coming? and sprayed his holy seed all over my face.I never got his number he just told me to pray to the heavens if I was ever in the mood for a booty call. Still havent heard back from him though.,moviescirclejerk,crm0l46,10,t5_2tfdo

4551464,0,t1_ct4biuq,You sound a little defensive as if youre trying say you want to do it but youre rationalizing it and saying it would be weird.Like three months ago I would have said yes but now I would still say yes but in a different way. I still would want to have sex with a pony but not really a character maybe Fluttershy Octavia Luna Lyra you know? But I really dont like mlp anymore so this answer is based on purely a sexual standpoint.Ponies are probably the sexiest things Ive ever seen in my life not exactly the characters just what they are their legs their eyes their manes their mouths everything is perfect. I would totally have sex with them but I wouldnt want to live in Equestria or any of that bullshit. I would like to keep one but she probably wouldnt like it because she would have to hide and just hang out in my house.A one night thing? Totally anyone really. I dont like all of them but even if Rainbow Dash was my only option I would say yes. I dont know how they would translate in real life but there are plenty fan art pictures that show a good example.I dont think I would be to comfortable with one around me because I wouldnt know what to do? Do I feed it? Do I pay attention to it? I dont care what I do around my dog because hes a fucking dog do I treat her like a human and talk to her? Back to my dog what if he flips shit because there is a god damn flying pony in my house. I couldnt leave her alone because thats not fair at all and she might fuck something up or answer the door and screw our deal up. I cant take her in public. I would totally keep her forever but I dont think it would be a paradise for her especially. Regardless of how I treat her she is basically a sex slave and that all well and good for a roleplay situation but it would be her life and she cant get away from it. At least I would have some information on her and know what to do a little bit. If she got into the hands of some hick across the street she is fucked.Bottom line I think I would be too selfish to pass it up but my life would be stressful as hell trying to figure out what to do with her afterwards. So many things would have to be accounted for and in the end she wouldnt like it and neither would you after awhile. I dont know if you would be taking her from Equestria of whatever or if she is just appearing and doesnt know how to talk or eat or fly or whatever in that case no I wouldnt do it Im not raising a god damn pony just so I can fuck it. Otherwise yes like I said I would be too selfish and I couldnt pass it up.Now to how it would work I dont know. I guess the act of sex would be pretty normal shes basically a horse just a lot cuter. If she spoke english and had a basic understanding of the situation and was reasonable to let me talk to her and explain how this is going to work then it would be pretty fine. Although other things like going outside telling people etc. would be hard to work out.I would need a Celesta to check up on her and tell me what she eats and if she is sick she is pretty shit out of luck unless I can buy some OTC medication for her. I wouldnt have to worry about her being pregnant right? I dont think she can get pregnant by a human. Anyway sure. But she would have to live up to the exceptions of a canon pony like knowing basics like English eating walking etc.,moviescirclejerk,ct4c2mv,1,t5_2tfdo

6152452,0,t3_3zrtsj,I was obsessed with Avatar from the days in  when it was a James Cameron project called Project . I followed the whole production. He promised insane CGI D and so much more. I was thinking This will for sure give me that same feeling of grand epicness I had when seeing Return of the King.But I knew the first time I saw the film that this was no Return of the King though it did deliver CGI and D. It did feel good those months when it came out that everyone was going nuts since all my friends knew I had been talking about that film for years. It was like being the first guy to discover a band that made it huge. But so many things bothered me about Avatar. I remember what stuck out most was the complete lack of pure awesome in the film. It is fair to call the film dull.The Thanator chase at the start is like an entire example of the films shortcomings. It should be awesome. But I always hated that the Thanator is supposed to be so scary and dangerous but we never see it rip some redshirt to shreds. It just isnt scary if we never see it burst through the bushes and rip some dudes head off in a PG way of course. Also why did he give it shiny plastic skin? Its like the least cool thing to make in CGI. Bad CGI looks shiny and plastic by default so it just isnt very cool looking as a CGI creature. Also why isnt the sound design scarier in this scene? During the slow motion shot of the Thanator throwing Jake around there is no interesting sound design. The sound effects just almost stop and the score just keeps doing its own thing as if there is no slow motion. I felt using King Kong  and Jurassic Park as an example that the sound effects should be way jump scarier if that makes any sense. Like not full on cheesy jump scares but just more low loud low loud to keep the audience on edge.I also dont get why it lacks other stuff like good quotes and defining scenes. Other James Cameron films are full of memorable stuff. Like the strip tease or fighter jet scenes from True Lies. The kiss on the bow in Titanic. The T from T. All the quotes and characters from The Terminator. With all the budget in the world how did Cameron forget to figure out some crowning moments of awesome? Jake returning on the big dragon is no bow kiss. The only things that come close is the destruction of home tree some people also love the first flight though I thought the test drive scene from How to Train Your Dragon put the first flight scene in Avatar to shame when it came to action cinematography score and awesomeness and that slow motion burning horse that they parodied in The Lego Movie.J.J. Abrams Star Trek that came out that same year was full of awesome scenes and moments. Everyone remembers that killer opening scene. The moment when the redshirt was sucked into the silence of space. The space jump. The scene where Bruce Greenwood talks Kirk into joining starfleet. Not to mention the reveal of the new Enterprise.Its really weird to me that Cameron in his eagerness to make the biggest film ever forgot to add big moments.,moviescirclejerk,cyoyxc7,2,t5_2tfdo

If every single character in the movie is going oh you gun get fukd now son then theres no tension whatsoever aside from Keanu honestly not being a very good actor its possible to use him in a nonemotive role but he really doesnt come across as badass it means were waiting the entire movie for Keanu to do something hes obviously incredibly capable of doing.

7481946,0,t1_d2sl6bq,Probably because Civil War is a terrible comic and being accurate to that specific storyline wouldve made for a Dawn of Justice level disaster. I honestly love the direction theyre going with the MCU Spidey. They skip over the teenage years pretty quickly in both previous versions and Garfield was like  by the time TASM  rolled around. Plus Ultimate SpiderMan is one of my favourite comics and Peter was a teenager all throughout that entire run. I do agree with uJamesB though although I think that applies more to fans of Garfields SpiderMan than anything else. He was an insufferable hipster that barely resembled Peter Parker. ,moviescirclejerk,d2snlnf,6,t5_2tfdo

8142567,0,t1_d4vaf9i,uj Theres nothing at stake for me to care. The actual Batman v Superman fight eventually gets boiled down to each of them being tricked by Lex in to doing it rather than just letting the characters own morals justify it they have reasons to dislike each other but they arent pushed over the edge until Lex which is my problem with it the film sets up why they dont like each other and kind of just ignores it. Theres all this day vs night black vs blue coming from Lex and I just dont see it. Theyre almost the exact same character they both kill they both act outside the law they both cause damage outside their original actions and the only real difference is that Superman is more powerful than Batman. It just made me feel emotionally detached from the fight. I dont like Batman or Superman in this film and so nothing really had any impact. Its the same problem I had with the Star Wars prequels. Its flashy and things are happening but I dont care about anyone involved or their reasons for fighting. At least something like Civil War felt like they tried to have reasons for their fights. The airport one was a little bit too contrived but at least most of the characters had reasons to be on teams and there was a clear objective get Bucky out of there. Doomsday I literally dont care about because hes just a big monster they fight. You could replace Doomsday with any other monster from any other movie and it wouldve been the same fight. Hes not interesting and he exists solely because if it wasnt a monster Superman would punch him once and it would be over. Honestly my favourite part of the fight was when Batman lumbers over to a sink rips it out of the ground and smashes it over Supermans head because it was so over the top it made me laugh. After that I was expecting a suplex from Batman.,moviescirclejerk,d4vd76y,13,t5_2tfdo

8349042,0,t3_4txu37,Minions are probably the greatist thing to happen in recent human history. It just shows how far D animation and computer technology has come and how we spent all these years developing algorithms and processors to fully render a lil chicken nugget guys huge lardy lumps complete with a photorealistic brownishyellow asshole inbetween those luscious cheeks. D technology has allowed humans to realistically jiggle big fat yellow fartknockers right in the theater with the D glasses. I saw this film in the theater and I just couldnt help but cry at the hyperrealistic buttholes which clenched and pulsate right in your face. Ive been buying minion toys nonstop since that changing moment of my life. I am now a Minionist with over  reposted minion pictures across each of my social media accounts and  minion toys under my literal belt. I just cant get enough at those fat muffintops bulging out those tight overalls before ballooning out as the minions pants drop while they say Bottom! violently rumbling as they unleash torrents of rapidfire fart flashes coated so much with shitparticles it actually colors the otherwise invisible gas clouds. And my favorite is when they spread their cheeks wide open and you can see all the hairs sticking out their anus look at their heads for an idea.

He also has character moments like when he asks HAL to sing Daisy to calm his nervesfeel less bad about brutally killing his only companion and I genuinely felt for him when HAL killed the dormant astronauts.

I said I know some idiots are whining like theres some organised attack even though there wasnt. You seem to think Im saying leave those subs alone.No Im saying this is a shitty post because I dont think the subject of the humour Marvel fans saying reviews are good for Dr Strange is funny enough to be on this sub. Theres plenty more material on that sub people constantly thanking Lord Feige or calling Age of Ultron a Underrated Masterpiece shit like that should be here. gt Its. The. Same. ThingSome posts may not be as jerky as others but thats OKWhile I understand where you are coming from I just dont think that was jerky enough to be on here. Maybe some circle jerky stuff happened on that post after I last saw it but from when I last saw it it was just some dudes letting people know the film had good reviews. Thats not jerky at all.gt Nolan fans during Interstellar Ghostbusters sub and DC Cinematic never cried about it like thisLike I said Theres plenty of idiots who are acting like there is some organised attack on rmarvelstudios not realising that there is a lot of circle jerky stuff going on there. So in that regard they have nothing to whine about its a fucking joke get over it. But in this case theres nothing funny here just a couple of guys saying Hey that movie has good reviews nothing jerky there.If im crying at all im not crying because of rmarvelstudios. Im whining because shit like this passes for content on this sub when theres plenty more stuff on that sub that could be used.,moviescirclejerk,d98cdfr,1,t5_2tfdo

By all accounts he seems like a genuinely nice and good person. Also unlike some other internet critics Chris is self aware enough to know when hes fanboyingbeing nostalgic vs delivering criticism which I do respect.That being said his reviews are shallow as hell. Despite his explosion intro and his hilariocity reviews he still often presents himself as someone whos more intellectual about film than the Jeremy Jahnses of YouTube. But his reviews dont reflect that and are all The directingwritingcinematographyactingeffectspacingchemistry was badgood. A. His book although I only read a few pages of it was even more of the same. A lot of repeating of the same basic points over and over without going into any sort of depth.When Chris makes claims like general audiences will hate it only big film fans like me will love it he just sounds snobby without demonstrating a talent for criticism to back it up.

Hes basing a version of Batman on his own misinterpretation of a classic story and wondering why people are annoyed at this. The Dark Knight Returns is perhaps one of the most popular Batman stories. The director of a Batman film inspired by it showing he doesnt even understandhe hasnt read it is not a good sign and further adds fuel to the fire that Snyder just doesnt get the characters hes adapting.  is going to go down as the year that two of the most iconic Batman stories The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke got movies based on or inspired by them made by people who just didnt even understand the story or characters they were adapting. ,moviescirclejerk,dd77v0t,9,t5_2tfdo
