445563,0,t1_cfqxxyy,No that makes perfect sense! I guess I can create a spreadsheet in excel convert it to PDF and then insert the links and make a portfolio like you said. This is great! Thanks for the info! I will do more research on this. ,landman,cfqy4na,2,t5_2vbvh
3604624,0,t1_cq3573o,Yes getting a lawyer I think is my next step.  I was just trying to determine weather I had any standing.  And speaking with the current Landman yes they have the same document.  With the same wording free gas  dwelling.  The exception being the circled items with the signature in the margin.  The one my friend has is the original with the signature in blue ink.  The understanding was that this could be parceled off and sold with that allotment  The previous Lanman agrees that this was the agreement.The old Landman gave us a name at the company of someone in particular to contact.  A landman that I have not spoke to yet Landwoman? actually.  He seemed to indicate that she would have the documentation for this well.,landman,cq35in3,1,t5_2vbvh

11269933,0,t3_5x7crk,Went to sign a ROW agreement with a couple and the wife had died from an overdose the week prior.Another time I went to track down a very nice landowner that I had signed a ROW agreement with.  I hadnt heard from him in a couple weeks and he hadnt returned my phone calls or emails.  Turns out he drown while fishing on a boat with his girlfriend.  Rumor has it the girl had something to do with the death...Way back in the day while leasing some guy told me I dont know you from a bag of assholes!.  Ive used that expression ever since.,landman,df9fhz3,2,t5_2vbvh
11432279,0,t1_dfrqu2x,I mean for the right price it can be ok. I am getting between  for the broker Ive done some parcels for. Its Ohio title that is easy for the most part but the title packet they want put together basically makes it too much of a hassle to continue doing it. It probably comes out to hr which is not that bad but not enough for me to do really be motivated to do title work. ,landman,dfru58u,2,t5_2vbvh
