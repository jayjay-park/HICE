3340295,0,t3_2yc6wo,Incredibly detailed and a keeper for sure but way complicated and over thought as most of these things are.  You do Bitcoin by feel after experience like sex for the most part and I think that the point was missed in this paper.  I just want to mine and use my SHA hardware into the future.  A lot of that paper seems to cover scams that generally cross many borders and while related to some degree are easily avoidable.,coindev,cp90nye,1,t5_2zlur
