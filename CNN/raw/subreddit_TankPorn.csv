1107623,0,t1_chu6k9v,Thank you for your answers. I have actually been subscribed to your youtube channel for quite some time so I have seen the progress you have made. I actually work on original vehicles for a museum in New England and your work has really been inspiring for me. gtTo answer your other question the tank weighs about  pounds  which is around half the weight of an original. The difference in weight is due to original tank being armored whereas our tank merely has the illusion of being armored.I figured this would be the case but I really appreciate the answer. I assume that your tank is actually a bit faster than an actual Panzer III would be? I have a few more questions if you dont mind. Is the engine an original?. What did this project cost?. In some of your videos you use a chain hoist on a movable rack to lift heavy equipment how much weight is yours rated for and how much did it cost? the rack that is The museum I work at could desperately use something similar though we would probably need a larger one the turret of the Pershing is quite heavy!. Where exactly did you get the plans to build your tank? I ask because I would be interested in getting some original technical drawings for an M Sherman.

1270059,0,t3_28lqyl,Cool magazine but I dont like the article about WoT. WoT is an arcade game it doesnt pretend to be anything else. It says right on their website that historicity is sacrificed for gameplay. And of course this sort of game would divorce tanks from their proper context but then so does every other game that isnt totally focused on realism and accuracy COD for instance. WoT is an arcade game and if you try to peg it into another category of game you are going to have a bad time and be laughed at.The on paper only tanks annoyed me too until I realized that WoT more than anything else in recent memory has revitalized interest in tanks and tank museums. There is a huge amount of content some of it even pretty damn good about tanks online now and that is thanks in large part to the spark that WoT provided. WoT can give people the wrong impression of how these machines actually operated but I have found that most people realize that WoT is not an accurate representation of tank warfare. ,TankPorn,cichye4,5,t5_2skj2

1888517,0,t1_ckfmgmr,i think the perception that the sherman was a disaster comes from the view that german and to a lesser extend soviet and also late war british tank designs were intended to be superior to the enemy the americans on the other hand look like they were intended to just get the job done. but to just get the job done you need to meet your adversary with roughly equal measures and consequently each time that the germans brought new superior tanks tiger  panther  tiger   the americans were caught on the short end. they always needed time to bring a superior or at least equal vehicle sherman with mm gun m m in the meantime the u.s. army had to beat the germans with inferior technology in superior numbers.its quite interesting that the u.s. airforce never had this just get the job done attitude but planned to use superior material.,TankPorn,ckgrauv,1,t5_2skj2

2156542,0,t1_cl9pmq0,Indeed it is. The decision to use the turbine version was a political  one. This is not a tank that was optimal as a tank it was a tank that was optimal for the policians in charge because the right companies build it.Look The fucking turbines use TWICE as much fuel. This means that if you want to supply them you need twice as many fuel trucks which means that they too need twice as much fuel to make the distance. This is in so far a political decision as that the US government is not interested in lowering defense spending see permanent war economy. The ratio compared to diesel is even worse when the tanks are in standby which happens a lot in tactical movement. In tactical movement you also do not depend on the slightly better acceleration at all. They are quieter how nice but even if they are just in standby they produce a very significant heat signature. While other MBTs have measurements to reduce theirs the Abrams does not even try since it would be futile to begin with.There is a reason why Russia went back to diesel and why no nation that ever held real trials chose the Abrams. The only foreign nations that chose Abrams did so for political reasons  nations such as Egypt and Iraq which recieve high subsidies for picking US products and Australia who also made an unarguably political choice. Even close allies like SaudiArabia are more interested in Leopard  India held real trials and decided for T.,TankPorn,cldy2b4,0,t5_2skj2

It was intended to fire both conventional HEATKE rounds as well as the Shillelagh missile out of the main gun. The larger caliber gun was required to fire the missile. The hull definitely shares some similarity with the Leo which makes sense given Germanys input on the MBT project. But the MBT program was designed to be a modern tank from the ground up. The MBT was specifically designed around maximum ballistic and radiological protection as well as the mm gun. That created a unique turrethull combo. If anything both the hull and turret are the primordial form of the LeoIIM. Both vehicles were heavily influenced by the MBT program.

3019217,0,t1_coam4q8,The MBT did actually put all of its crewmembers into the turret. The Commander Gunner and Loader all sat above the driver on level with the gun and rotated with the turret. The driver OTOH sat lower near the front of the turret. His station was specially designed to counter rotate to allow him to point forward no matter where the rest of the turret pointed. This solution was actually pretty effective as it made the tanks hull more compact and reduced the ultimate silhouette of the tank. Unfortunately it was a more expensive solution which was bad for a tank project that was way over budget and a tank which cost x per unit what it was supposed to. The Germans actually sought to redesign the tank late in the project with a driver in a traditional hull mount. But that idea wasnt accepted by the Americans for other reasons. I think that the later Keller tank was built around this design though. ,TankPorn,coaxtoh,3,t5_2skj2

8113740,0,t3_4qc8yh,I mean to be fair to the M it was kind of an evolution from the M and then into the M. It lived on through the M the M and even the M benefited from some of the lessons learned in these tanks. Its legacy is in the great US tanks we have today.Im sure some of you here know the US Army armor branchs insignia is an M Pershing imposed over crossed sabers. We all know the M is the direct predecessor to the M and its one of my favorite tanks. Sometimes I like to look at the Pershing and see how it kind of evolved and changed all the way up to the M and M through the M and M. And while the M itself is a totally new design it is easy to see when you look inside and out of the two of them and the tanks in between how American tanks evolved from that one. The Sherman and the tank destroyers of WWII were great tanks but it was the Pershing that truly set the standard. In my opinion of course.Its just a really cool evolution just the same as how the Soviet T influenced the T. Then the T to the T the T which evolved into the T so on and so forth.I know that some of the tanks Ive mentioned were proprietary designs but its interesting to look at them and see how the previous tanks influenced them.

Well no. If you fire both at the same time they will hit in pretty much the same spot while doubling the recoil the mount and turret ring have to deal with so congratulations if they penetrate they will kill the tank just like if one shell from one gun penetrated... And if you wanted a quick follow up shot you would have already reloaded the gun that was fired before the dust settles the gunners sight is clear and he got back to aiming at the target so having a second gun would be no faster.In short twin tank guns have literally no redeeming qualities.,TankPorn,d6qp9f9,5,t5_2skj2

8880214,0,t1_d7f71e9, The Maus was to be used when the Germans had air superiority if this was achievedit would of been impossible to pen. Literally. And it used battleship armor. I forget the process but it was high quality steel. Tests show that nothing could penetrate it. The mm was originally a artillery piece turned antitank cannonof course its going to be superior to a smaller caliber gun when it comes to HE characteristics. And I dont know what the doctrine was for Panther ammunition load outbut I know that Tiger ls were to have  ammunition ratio AP shells and  HE shells. I cant recall the HE filler amount for the Lbut HE is HEif it lands near a soldierthe soldier is either killed or hes losing a limb.its more fair to compare AT characteristics rather than antiinfantry characteristics. That was ONE Tiger llH the Russians tested out of  built. I will not deny the fact that by mid German steel quality was going down severely. But to conclude that ALL Tiger llHs were of poor quality because of ONE tank is entirely unfair. If I recall correctlythat Tiger llH the Soviets tested had a fire that burned out the tankwhich could weaken the armor greatly. And of course theres multiple photos proving that not all Tiger llHs suffered from poor armor quality. And I love the weak side armor excuse. If you have a M mma Kwk L mm Kwk L mma Kwk L mm etc pointed at a piece of steel thats mms thick its going to go through. Side armor is not supposed to deflect enemy shells like the FRONTAL armor is supposed to. Hence why there was no nation that made a tank with mms if front armorand mms of side armor.  The side armor is there to.provide structural rigidity protect the crew from small arms fire If youre depending on side armor to save youyoure tanking wrong.

If all of them contributed to the kill its not as abstract to attribute the kill to a single man although its usually to the commander.

10277957,0,t1_dc90e3u,Water does offer a certain amount of protection but probably not as much as youd expect against APFSDS. It is less dense than hardpacked dirt this is why hardpacked dirt doesnt float. There are a few concerns other than the direct protection offered though.Rivers and lakes tend to be lower than the surrounding terrain which reduces sight lines considerably. Generally you want to be engaging at ranges of hundreds of metres  hard to do when youre parked at the bottom of a river bed. If the enemy is close enough to shoot at theyre probably going to be close enough that minimizing your profile isnt really going to help. Its also pretty hard to camouflage a tank sitting in the middle of a river.Also it would make reaching the vehicle difficult as well as making it impossible to repair in place. The tank could also sink into the river bed and become stuck. Finally prolonged exposure to water is not great for any vehicle thats not a boat  it leads to corrosion and fouling and if youre in deep enough to be properly hull down the vehicle probably needs to be rigged for fording which is awkward and makes it difficult to rapidly reposition. Youll notice that it is possible to put a tanks engine deck below ground level in a hole without covering the exhausts and ventilation with dirt the same is not true of water.So you could use a relatively shallow ditch for protection but youd basically be using it as an impromptu hole rather than relying on the water. Going into deep water is asking for trouble and not really worth it.,TankPorn,dc9299q,9,t5_2skj2

You guys copy pasta the name of a tank commander who even if assume the worst knocked out  tanks before getting destroyed in return. Even ignoring the Eastern Front. Well its your hobby I was just curios.gtPanthers sure did wonders at Arracourt though. Its almost like they explode like every other tank when hit by anti tank fire.Yeah no. Again you are wrong. Not every tank got penetrated after the first hit. You seem to ignore what I explaine to you about the postko survival rate.
