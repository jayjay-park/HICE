I agree without having experienced hypersexuality it must be nearly impossible to understand. And I know what you mean about learning to keep your mouth shut I struggle with that as well particularly when manic and hypersexual! Well you can always come here to vent! I may not have any answers but I definitely understand!,hypersexuality,coz1706,1,t5_36ycm
9427867,0,t3_59p9df,Firstly I just want to say that no matter what YOU are not the issue. Sex addict or not never feel like you arent enough for someone.The thing with sex addicts is that nothing really truly feels like enough. You tend to cross more and more boundaries to keep getting your high. Or impulsively seek sexmasturbation to keep feeling high. It never has to do with their partner or anyone else... Its just them.I cant speak for him on if hes a sex addict or not but I know after a certain point you can notice a pattern. If you catch him again doing these things that youve asked him not to then I think it might be probable but not definite. Check to see if your area has any SAnon type groups. It may benefit you and give you an insight.I also think you should try uRambleRant suggestion.,hypersexuality,d9b1pe2,2,t5_36ycm
