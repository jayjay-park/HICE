8980936,0,t3_53a2ut,I can auto up to b and im having a similar issue with b.  So the thing here is it seems the most important stat in the game right now for dungeons is defense.  If your monsters are underleveled     is underleveled for giants b you are going to be drastically low on defense which will cause you to take insane damage from the golem and also the minion waves if they decide to all in one of your guys multiple turns without you having ulti charge.  Hp is fine for pvp but in pve where youre going to take  turns to kill the golem boss you need to have sustain if your  monsters have high defense and the healer has high heals that means you are getting much more EHP per heal that your healer puts out and are much more able to survive.,MSLGame,d7rddon,2,t5_3fop7

Ive spent x that amount in Summoners war and directly from those dollars Ive gotten literally  dupe low tier  stars and zero  stars.  nat s and  nat  are good rolls. There arent even a large number of nat s in the game yet? What did you expect did you think you deserved multiple nat s and the best nat s for your measly  dollars and  month of play? Id recommend avoiding gatcha games in general if that was your intention. Its usually pretty much impossible to get a handful of nat s as in a few without spending THOUSANDS in games like these. These games are designed for pretty much everyone to lose most of the time while making it look like everyone else is getting good rolls via chat interface. If you instead posted that you played for  months and have only gotten  nat s and spent hundreds then maybe Id shed a tear or  for you. ,MSLGame,d8lqrfl,1,t5_3fop7

9277007,0,t3_57f458,Another useful tip is DO NOT spend a lot of gold on  to  star gems. Upgrading is expensive and there is no reason to burn that much gold on getting a  star or  star gem to  star unless its a quest then its the cheapest method to do so then on a  star gem.  Star would be good for a while. Dont be greedy Avoid doing more then   summons and save the rest for energy. Seriously my light Nike that i farmed from a dungeon was possible because i had energy to keep farming it since i spent in energy refills. Your better off spending it on refills anyways because it allows you to continue you farm as much as possible and if eggs are really what you want you can farm the eggs in starstone dungeon or element dungeon and get two things done at once.

Most of the ones that are really good are the lightdark versions of four star monsters anyway. The three star monsters are complete trash.Im not saying that there are no good LD monsters. Im saying that to treat them as the end allbe all of MSL is silly. Three high eggs is pretty much guaranteed to be more valuable than one LightDark high.

Use other birdie to evolve him.Fire birdie rank according to tier list.PVES.Probably because hes a defenderhas a tauntuseful in some stage and sapgolemboss and also his hp leader is highly advisable in stages.More hp means less dying.PVPA because taunt is useful when you need to cover somebody in your team.Sap might get resist or it deals low damage but still it burns the hp of the enemy.DragonB because Dragon is immune to sap and taunt but the minion wave can be sap and taunt.He might get C if minions has the same immunity as dragon.About sap it deals   of max hp per tick so if you have  sap ticks then its minus  hp per turn as long as sap debuffs is around.,MSLGame,dcht6da,2,t5_3fop7

10781013,0,t3_5u4m1b,Getting over it makes this sound like a minor problem which it isnt if people are leaving.  I remember back during the Jack event there was a player with picture proof of over  runs with no dark Jack encounter.  Although I was also annoyed at that point caught a couple legendaries and not a single dark Jack encounter imagine how it felt to be him? Get over those  runs and accept rng?    If you put in hours and get no results of course you are going to feel disheartened. Some leave some carry on.  I dont play too many mobile games know much at all about them but I do play a game called Puzzles and Dragons.  Its similar to MSL in that you do rolls rebirth eggs for a chance at getting rares. One of the strongest monsters from that game right now though is a guaranteed drop for completing a very hard dungeon.  Skill ups ascension isnt guaranteed.  However thats just a single rng barrier.  In this current event as another poster below stated there are multiple rng barriers.  Rebirthing a dark truffle catching enough fire truffles obtaining bons in the future and the hope if getting a variant Venus if she has a good leader skill?.     Id like to think I have a fairly high tolerance level  I play tanks in games I like trickroom teams I dont mind grinding as much as some people but the RL friends that started this game with me have all quit.

Sealing every  turns could be amazing. I used to run this squad with fire asura instead of vamp  and it has  success.  Problem is  it took much longer maybe coz asuras hits are single target.  When I swapped him for vamp  it reduced the clear time significantly from mins  mins to mins to mins. And Elpis was not healing more constantly coz vamps hp is self sustained.

11066651,0,t1_demb87m,Firstly. Even the greatest of mistakes does not make the materials you are using suddenly vanish and you have to get new one. In addition to a mistake made by the artisan is paid for by the artisan. Not their customer. The customer pays for the resources and to get said resources for point A to B. If the Artisan in question makes a mistake they pay to fix the issue. Their client doesnt give them additional resources.Secondly while yes there is magical things involved. Tina herself is not doing it. She a blacksmith. Not an arcane enchanter. Any magic happening exist with the gems  themselves and the resonance that occurs when in close proximity to each other. The fact that they somehow become stronger because Tina cleans them and sets them in a fancy setting makes no logical sense. Even taking magic into consideration... and again even if she was somehow enhancing their powers which as a blacksmith she wouldnt be doing. Her hand slipping wouldnt suddenly make said process instantly stopin fact her lines even make it sounds as if she failed in crafting the setting for the gem. In fact if such a slight mistake would cause something like that to occur. With the amount of times she damn welly does it your entire ship should explode from her mistakes. Magic itself is always a volatile thing. Messing something up never ends well. Especially messing up millions of times. Hell Id be more inclined to believe the gem in question would go inert to any and all magical benefits it could give by her messing upif her mistake would not end up in a violent explosion. They would sure make whatever she is working on in a magic sense useless. Though the gem would still be there as a fancy trinket.,MSLGame,deme7kb,1,t5_3fop7

11179184,0,t1_dez2wfe,I think the root of the dark truffle complaint is the poor planning of the event though. To be fair I got what I needed in order to finish an L. Venus. But half the time theyre not giving us any sort of information or any sort of encapsulation of the entire event. For example it seems really strange to halfplan an event and not release the kit from the beginning. Instead they hyped it up and it worked against them because of the expectation. They could have just as easily set the expectation appropriately by stating the mons abilities how many different types of Venuses there would be make a very clear plan from the getgo about what the user should expect to do over the course of the event. Instead we got half of the event had excessive speculation even egged on by the hype of the developer and then a second half that doesnt match the intensity of the first half.Thats not to say theyre not doing good things.

11458719,0,t3_63faah,The game hasnt been out for a year not even  of a year. Also you should have a free nat  from the contract and if you have been doing Titans then you should have a Siegfried from those eggs so thats two nat s you should have.From your incorrect information it leads me to believe you dont really play this game that diligently so that might be the reason you dont have one because you should have at least two by now.

11631612,0,t3_65zkvm,I pulled him recently aswell unfortunately i didnt like his RGB counterparts so i threw them all into the thor rebirth including a variant. Im happy with thor so no regrets.  His stats seem fairly balanced so he shouldnt be too hard to build being an attack type it would be almost impossible to use him in b though. Dark Mandragoras just too hit too hard on crits for any non tank character to survive reliably without some sort of HP Siphon.  That being said he looks like a good candidate for PvP ToC and Dragons.  When I get around to building mine it will probably be typical valourruinintution atkcrhp or def build. Hes a nuke with Predator other then elemental advantageneutrality thats the reason youd choose him over other CCers.,MSLGame,dgegf0m,2,t5_3fop7

11636933,0,t3_65saqy,Hi there this is my first comment after a large time of stalking.My question is... Has the water titan changed from last week to this week?Last week i started using green pinos in a decent way and got great results for me m without having problems with the altered status seal.What i have read is that in the first wave u had to deal with these status effectsbut the second wave was full damage and no stats... And somehow it worked for me.The thing is... This week despite i have upgraded my mons and thet have now from  to  RES... Seal is making them useless...and my results are halved...Do you have any answer to my doubts or any piece of advise? Should i forget about ratecritatk and start aiming for  res? Are you experiencing the same difficulties? Or i just was extremely lucky last week? Thank you in advance and excuse me for my English.,MSLGame,dgf258e,1,t5_3fop7
11649063,0,t1_dgf38cg,gt go for the one that will help you out the most right nowthis. if you need tank go for fire odin. shes THE best fire tank ive ever seen. but in my situation in needed a fire attacker so i riased fire indra instead of her. fire shiva isnt suited for b imo. no dmg and no need for cc in there. water shellie?good for every content of the game. water arthur? meh. the only use ive got for him is blue orb generation when i need it. like in fire starstone dungeons ill take him along with wet yuki and they take down the boss like a fly. also hes att down for  turn is op if you need debufs. also if gemmed well hes a real annoyance in pvp so if you want to focus pvp he is really helpful. dont even bother with wood hana. out of fire leo wood anu and dark mona i say go for mona. shes a beast and you can take her almost everywhere. whereas fire leo will be food for wood one nd wood anu will be food for light anu. and again see what your situation is. like if you in need of wood attacker ignore all above and raise wood anu,MSLGame,dggfomx,1,t5_3fop7

That means they arenT confident in what they do and chances are soon the facebook playerbase will decide about everything and mess things up...Getting screwed over... idk seems very harsh for having to change up your team but maybe Im just one of the weird people that dislikes stale stuff.
