4499496,0,t3_3cmx6c,Just curious what do you mean by wading pockets? Never heard of them guessing they are just some sort of waterproof pocket? If thats the case I dont care what the brand is I wouldnt bet my phoneshellsetc. on whether the waterproofing would work by wearing the jacket outside my waders and putting the pocket under water. Its nice having those bigfleece lined pockets at the bottom of a jacket but if I know Im going to potentially be in water up past my waist I always tuck my jacket in my waders and use the chest pockets for anything I need. Im in no way a Drake fan boy but I have one of those quarter zip jackets with the fleece bottom that has the strings to tighten around your waist and chest to stay put when putting waders on and I love that thing. Plenty warm and the pockets up top are really deep for plenty of shellscallsphoneetc. Mine doesnt have a hood but I cant hunt with a hood on anyways just limits my field of view. Plus I always either have a hat or toboggan on anyways.,Waterfowl,csxtdsi,1,t5_2v0gs

7208786,0,t3_4de0ru,If you can find a left handed version I would recommend buying a SBE II American. I just bought one in the fall and got a right hand version in MODB for . Its the same exact gun as a regular SBE II except it doesnt have the fancy stock just a regular stock. Ive shot mine and a regular one and I cant even tell the difference on recoil reduction. Also look around at local gun shops I got my gun at a local shop and at gander mountain they wanted if I remember right  for the same model. ,Waterfowl,d1xkywt,1,t5_2v0gs
7874107,0,t3_4mtk0u,I got one last season and the main reason I got the sbe is because it had all the options I wanted. Left handed with max  camo. I love it. It just points naturally for me with how light it is. I hunt in flooded timber and anywhere else I can. The gun has never let me down. When it comes down to it get the one that feels the best to you.,Waterfowl,d414eqb,1,t5_2v0gs

8500754,0,t3_4w4v37,Goose hunting on the river we use a rough line of geese right in front of the blind. With room for geese to land in the center. For field geese we do a large W again wth room for them to land in front of the blind. For flooded corn ducks we do large groups to left and to the right of the blind. Sometimes the big W or J but usually just a large spread out grouping. This year we are adding a mojo to the mix. For every group we set up according to the wind. Decoys always facing into the wind and the Landing zone or x is set right for the ducks to land how they want with the wind. ,Waterfowl,d645any,1,t5_2v0gs

9054062,0,t3_546v4g,I ordered the wheels off amazon. They are for a push mower. They are on  inch shaft that I u bolted to the sled. I sealed the holes with silicon gasket maker. Holding the wheels on are  inch locking collars on the inside and washers and  lynch pins so I can take them off if its not floating well. If u was to do it again I would either use a longer shaft of put in on the bottom so that I didnt have to trim the lip to fit the wheels. ,Waterfowl,d805jmy,1,t5_2v0gs

10997623,0,t3_5wzyz2,If you can make a few trips I would go the first day and photograph. While photographing listen to the birds talk to each other. Listen to content birds on the ground. What does a happy goose or duck sound like? Listen to them calling to other birds in the air. Try to learn the language. Once you get a good idea what the natural birds sound like try to mimic them. I practice in my truck. My calls hang from my rear view mirror. On the second day call to the birds. Try to get the birds on the ground. ,Waterfowl,deejp5p,5,t5_2v0gs
