4759294,0,t1_ctts19u,hes actually incorrect on the second question. A sword and a buckler will allow you to reroll one failed parry not two parry attacks.,mordheim,ctugd9h,2,t5_2t8jg
5481861,0,t3_3q2ddd,gtMordheim heavily rewards the use to dual weapons somewhat rewards the use two handed weapons MCOD heavily penalizes this alternative accouterments.Just a point on this. I think the way they have done weapons in MCOD is good. To maximize damage you go for a hander when the character is low rank and thus can make few attacks and when you reach high enough rank to do  attacks per turn with a hander or with dual wielding you change to dual wielding. hander  shield is the best for defensive units going for armor and parry skill. While hander and empty hand is best for cloth units which go high agility and boost dodge. usually archers who dont have to spend points on strength I agree with most of the rest of your points though. ,mordheim,cwccxtt,4,t5_2t8jg
5501426,0,t1_cweunt9,Yeah the Mutation RNG is something that the other warbands dont have. I mention it in my lets play at least once that they should implement mutations for all warbands apart from the sisters of course.  I find the Magister a bit weak though whats your impression?

5532298,0,t1_cwisi46,So buy a highlevel archer and just pump int and BS and Agi at level  send him to reserve to train lads got talent. Easy enough. Im gonna try that.,mordheim,cwissfk,1,t5_2t8jg
5754827,0,t3_3tz3z2,Theyve said they want to add more but time and money are a factor. This game is from a very small dev and publisher. The dev team is only  people.Xcom has all those options because firaxis and k have way more money time and people they are able to invest.,mordheim,cxafw2b,6,t5_2t8jg

6021989,0,t1_cy8zq7o,Thanks for checking it out.I fixed both errors. The mutations thing should have been in anyways and the jumping was just a small fix and a good one thanks there. If there is a skill with a missing effect let me know which and i add it.,mordheim,cy90874,1,t5_2t8jg
6155983,0,t3_3ztdqr,The later ones give you good reward that makes it worth to play through those rather long missions. You will get a blue armor of every type. And you will get  Grimoires allowing you to raise your current and max  times for each of the advancements Physical Mental Martial. And that is Act  only.,mordheim,cypdcwm,1,t5_2t8jg
6156838,0,t3_3ztdqr,Seemed a little silly in one of the campaign missions when my Captain was standing at what seemed to be a combination spawn pointbottleneck and ended up getting over  xp you get xp per enemy taken out of action by slowly web of steelcounter attacking his way through an endless tide of skaven v until the rest of my warband finished the mission.,mordheim,cypgv0k,1,t5_2t8jg

6229253,0,t1_cywohb1,Ah ja das sieht besser aus. Ich wrde die ganze Class zerlegen books.js Injurie.js skill.js equipment.js stat.js usw.. Ist recht schwer da was zu finden. Auerdem habe ich mir angewhnt alle Strings die in die Ausgabe gehen zentral ab zu legen. Das erleichtert es spter ungemein eine bersetzung oder Rechtschreibprfung durch zu fhren.Die hashSaveBuild function gefllt mir. Hier knnte man z.B. ansetzen und in einer spteren Version denn hash Serverseitig speichern. So kann man eine krzeren deeplink generieren. Auerdem wre es wohl mglich ein parr interessante Statistiken zusammen zu bauen.edit mir fehlt irgendwie schon die ganze Zeit eine mglichkeit das . waffenset mit zu verwalten zwinker zwinker ,mordheim,cyxp5j4,2,t5_2t8jg
6401010,0,t1_czh51vy,Interesting. I have started trying to focus a little more on looting instead of immediately engaging first pick up a piece of loot then charge. Making noticeably more money but Im starting to feel the sting when one of my guys with a full inventory of wyrdstone dies and the enemy team routs before I can recollect it. I suppose it depends heavily on the situation but would you say its worth letting an enemy live an extra turn or two to ensure you collect enough nearby loot before they rout?,mordheim,czh8a8u,1,t5_2t8jg

8993832,0,t1_d7nkjrx,Wow it has been a long delay. Sorry real life is kicking my butt Im only off of work bc of kidney stones right now so it is safe to say I have mixed feelings about my new free time. Thank God for prescription narcotics in any case. So take my newest set of answers with a grain of salt as I am loaded up with Oxycontin right now! XDOkay I left off on the Ogre. I can understand your mixed feelings about this guy hes big ugly and kinda middle of the road. I use mine a lot though and heres why. Remember how well the RatOgre does with a little push? Well his cousin here needs no push no stupidity no babysitter all the DPS potential. Use the same basic build that worked for the RatOgre but none of the Dodge stuff. I used Defensive Stance myself but I think Guard Stance might have been better just emphasize his ability to take a hit. I used Hardy as well but looking back Im not sure that was the right move.It is true that he has no special ability but Fear but he also brings something to the table that no other Merc does hes immune to Psychology himself. Hes the only Merc who doesnt have a chance of crying like a little girl when a Daemon RatOgre Possessed etc charges him. Sure his attacks can be parried but so can all the other Mercs and he hits an awful lot harder.Also stop fatshaming him about his size  youll give the poor guy a negative body image!As for the Champion he can be built a lot like the Sister Superior  youre right in saying the Mercs need less cooperation that the Sisters do. The only buffs my Mercs usually have is War Cry on the Captain and Captains Order on the Smuggler. I actually built my Champion with Defensive stance as well to help with nonParryable attacks. With his Adaptable Defense passive and a purple Shield he can have over  Melee Resistance which isnt a perfect solution but certainly better than nothing. As far as the sheer number of Heroes I look at that as an opportunity rather than a problem. Means I can run my Mercs many diffrent ways Go rangedheavy with the Smuggler Warlock and a Hero Marksman or have a melee team with the Champion Youngblood and WolfPriest. I like that the Mercs can adjust their battle plan by choosing different heroes. BTW the WolfPriest isnt bad definitely a Melee Spellcaster has some interesting buffs and isnt bad with an axe either. Still working on this guy though. Yeah the problem with leaving healing units behind is soon youve got a rank  Boss skewing the encounter level up multiple Boss units is a good answer though. As for the Witch Hunters... I havent really played them yet! Or at least beaten anything with them yet. Your basic plan seems solid and I dont know enough about their Impressive to weight in on his utility the one Witch Hunter band I started hasnt gotten to rank  yet. The Heroes in general look awesome the KnightTemplars Stoic and Unwavering are awesome The WarriorPriests spells are amazing and the Captain himself is an amazing DodgeCounterattack machine. As for ranged I hate to always push her but the Smuggler might work here. Captain as dodgetank KnightTemplar as heavy armor tank Warrior Priest as BuffHeals and  Smugglers as ranged Ive been running all Flagellant henchmen as they are surprisingly good Dodgers and too crazy to care about the giant monsters they fight. I can see what you mean about the Captain as ranged but Hunters Patience is just so awesome It works just like the Mercenary Captains Swift Reaction which mean free Counterattacks with h weapons and Sidestep. Means you cant dualwield but think about it. Give him a purple sword and Sidestepmastery and you can up to  free Counterattacks even after you use up all of the red pills. Maybe Strong Blow wouldwork here so you use up all  at max rank. ,mordheim,d7sx3ri,1,t5_2t8jg

10858070,0,t1_ddyus5h,It seems to me at least having worked on it for a while the AI operates in a pattern of spread out to search for wyrdstone  spot enemy  all members make a beeline to kill enemy.In spread missions vs the Skaven that is pretty much turn . The skaven follow the same strategy of everyone else but they respond MUCH faster to that initial sighting. They find someone alone and kill him usually before they even get a chance to get their initiative up. Skaven arent that much weaker than everyone else that you can easily play against them  man down and Ive yet to reach a point where an isolated damage dealer does not die to a dogpile.,mordheim,ddzxm1u,1,t5_2t8jg
11294556,0,t1_dfc4bc6,I paid  and I love the game so Id say yes its worth it.  But as others said it can be tough at times and people in your warband WILL die.  Its not as unforgiving as XCOM but it can be compared to that game series for ease of explanation.,mordheim,dfc7zpd,3,t5_2t8jg
