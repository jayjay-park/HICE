6952231,0,t3_4av9j7,Thanks for this. I didnt know anything about who was running. I would really hate to see the hugbox movement come to MUN. Luckily Im not sure the culture here is a good fit for it. At least for now.,memorialuniversity,d14d8r9,2,t5_2t4t8
9414286,0,t3_599b4d,I think there is one or two but theyre only available to students studying Phys Ed.Like the other poster said you would be better off participating in some of the sporting events hosted by faculty societies or joining a team.
