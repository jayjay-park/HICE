11391390,0,t1_degc1c7,Censorship is always so interesting especially in terms of its massive upwelling ascendency  recent years in certain little korners. On that note. thanks to mrockatansky for   trying to post this reply at the Observing Art Appear From Nowhere  disallowed muzzled by censors on excuse of get this  DETECTED AS SPAMlt  MRockatansky  a month ago Detected as spam Thanks well work on getting this corrected.To an outsider you seem to have gotten somewhat addicted to Terence McKenna. What do you make of your fascination with him?The somewhat addicted nature of intrigue w the charismatic hero of the psychedelic movements s its popular reinsurgency stage  touches a delicate nerve. Observing psychedelias current milieu in its trajectory as devolved since its founding era  McKenna mainly seems to have fostered an excessively zealous unsettling preoccupation  fanaticlike in many ways. The movement in his name whose ball Mr Lin would advance  wraps itself in the psychedelic cause staking many claims upon it in McKennas name with the greatest of ease.In the wake of damaging s fiascoes from Leary at Harvard to Manson helter skleter  the subject of tripping was abandoned in effect  left up for grabs. McKenna saw his opportunity thus to bid for the Leary crown as heir apparent  and acclaimed official spokesman of by and for ruling subcultural authority.Since his untimely April  demise the preoccupation McKenna fostered with his name and claim to fame seems to have only deepened  as it hardens and narrows apace  like any cult of personality.For a telling study in the mark McKenna left upon those drawn in to his spellcasting one need look no further than his most infamous caper the End Of History he forecast for Dec  .As in Old Time religions high stakes for the soul in eternity fated either for heaven or hell  so McKenna caught his audience between crosshairs of ultimate fear or hope  that YK would prove to be the End or Beginning. Would his eschaton be doomsday or the glorious advent of a new golden age? Quite a psychodrama. As he worded it in the Epilogue of his True Hallucinations My fear is if these ideas are less than true our world is destined for a very final and ordinary death. For reason has grown too feeble to save us from the demons we have set loose. My hope is that I may bear witness to the fact there is a great mystery ... promising to realize itself and to give real meaning to what is otherwise only the confusion of our lives and our collective past.As older gospel offers a carrot and stick choice  two ways to get caught up fear of hell and heavenly hope  McKennas new wine in old skin seems to have served as ideal bait for fishing shallow subcultural waters of the psychedelic peasantry  at the th centurys fin de siecle. Those who swallowed it most deeply  are permanently in the web he spun. And the effects demonstrated resemble psychological straightjacketing  a loss sacrifice or abandon of significant thought and thinking capability as a matter of ready willing or able  to face dismal reality.Those of us not in the web can not only notice but even acknowledge  no  didnt bring some eschaton neither of glory nor doom. In spite of whatever bets placed by those eagerly drawn in to McKennas Psychedelic Casino games  neither history nor time came to a crashing halt.But in the wake of such hitandrun impact  reality itself ends up more than some can acknowledge. One might think by sounds from the screaming abyss in McKennese  McKennas YK prophecy all came true just like he said. Or is just about to still and always. Its not due to low IQ or lack of education among the peasantry. Its a matter of psychological damage to cognition perception effectively disenabled  brainwash in colloquial vocab.Mr Lins hardly the only public profile case file in the psychological retreat or refuge taken in that mighty fortress our bard. Consider the case of an author notable as D. Rushkoff excitely chirping in the immediate wake of the YK impact to Other brother DMacAs I experienced what you went through you were outside time for  days! ... I feel like it was a prelude to the reality in which were all living now although maybe a bit less obviously  not the end of times but THE End OF Time  I THINK WERE NOW LIVING IN A POSTTEMPORAL POSTHISTORIC REALITY ... !  gtCONT,terencemckenna,dfn73k1,1,t5_2sdzf
