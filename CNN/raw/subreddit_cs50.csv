6422,0,t1_cef496w,gtWith free online classes its even worse because you dont even have a financial incentive to complete the courses. They arent costing you money and no one cares if you fail so its easy to run out of steam after a few weeks and give up.On the other hand though if you really want to learn computer science but lose interest in the course halfway through you can still think about it as a time investment. You need to learn CS anyway and youve already put so much time into the course that it simply isnt justifiable to just give up. I value my time and I need to see things through. The financial incentive is a good boost if you cant afford not to fail but learn to view time as an even more important investment and youll seriously go places.,cs50,cef61wk,3,t5_2s3yg

111483,0,t3_1vcliu,Honestly a lot of the concepts youre learning in cs are directly relevant to building a big website.  Take for instance just the facebook search feature.  You want to find a friend named Emily Thompson or something facebook will first need to find all the emily thompsons out of its billions of users... so binary search? maybe every name is hashed in some way who knows. but its a search algorithm.  Then facebook will want to sort all of these emily thompsons by relevance to you geographic location mutual contacts mutual organizations trying to score each emily thompson it found to put the most likely one youre looking for at the top of the list.  This is essentially a scoring process followed up by a sorting algorithm maybe quickSort or mergeSort.. really depends.So facebook wants to do this ALL before youre even done typing out emily thompson so almost with every keystroke they need to access all of this data.  These are huge engineering problems most of which youre already familiar with albeit on a much smaller scale.  Along the way you better believe theyre looking to optimize an algorithm from n worst case time to say big O of n log n or perhaps theyll even give a huge bonus to somebody who takes something from nlogn remember all those constants weve been ignoring? to nlogn... Almost everything youve already been learning is highly relevant to a gigantic social network.  The key to all of these products is their back end design less so the way the look and feel to the user even though thats important too and extremely linked to the backend in some cases.,cs50,cer4ihj,1,t5_2s3yg

The amp operator produces the address of its operand argument. So the expression ampvaluesi produces a value of type pointertoint that points to the location of the ith element of the values array. That pointer allows swap to store a new value into that location even though it doesnt have access to the whole array.You should put a declaration of your swap function before main in helpers.c    void swapint a int bThat tells the compiler to expect the full definition later so it knows how to compile calls on swap even before it has looked at the full definition of the function.,cs50,cf4kbla,1,t5_2s3yg

286934,0,t1_cfag3rz,Sounds like you have a good working idea about how to set it up. To start the function look at how move is called. It receives an int as an argument presumably the tile number to swap positions with the blank tile. Can you find the location of that value? If so then you can apply the logic you described to swap it with the blank.Also keep in mind that the board is an array of ints so the blank tile value needs to be an int as well. You can display it as an underscore or anything else but be sure to compare it as an int.Edit Updated to respond directly to question.,cs50,cfai6ms,1,t5_2s3yg

382117,0,t3_1ygtch,The goal here is to practice creating programs that use command line functions rather than taking all input using GetInt and the like.

432092,0,t1_cfpc7jt,goto is a command that tells the computer to go directly to a certain piece of code. In this case goto fail means go directly to the code labeled fail which is this    fail        SSLFreeBufferampsignedHashes        SSLFreeBufferamphashCtx        return errThe problem is that after running this line    if err  SSLHashSHA.updateamphashCtx ampsignedParams ! err is equal to zero which means the function ran successfully.But then the function skips the call to SSLHashSHA.final and goes directly to the fail label. err still contains the success code though so when this function runs return err the rest of the program will think nothing went wrong.So the function is skipping part of the verification process but still returning a success code.,cs50,cfpjunz,3,t5_2s3yg
444895,0,t1_cfqvmt2,ampampamp Endianness sfw gtgtIn computing memory commonly stores binary data by organizing it in bit units bytes When a data word uses multiple such units the order of storing these bytes into memory becomes important. The terms endian and endianness refer to how bytes of a data word are ordered within memory.gtEach byte of memory is associated with an index called its address which indicates its position. Bytes of a single data word such as a  bit integer datatype are generally stored in consecutive memory addresses a  bit int needs  such locations. Bigendian systems are systems in which the most significant byte see Most significant bit of the word is stored in the smallest address given and the least significant byte is stored in the largest. In contrast little endian systems are those in which the least significant byte is stored in the smallest address. Say the data word was A B C D a set of  bytes and memory addresses starting at a with offsets    and  are given. Then in big endian systems byte A is placed in offset  B in  C in  and D in . In littleendian systems the order is the reverse of it.gtAn example on endianness is to think of how a decimal number is written and read in placevalue notation Since a number is written left to right the leftmost position is analogous to the smallest address of memory used and rightmost position the largest. For example the number one hundred twenty three is written    with the hundreds place leftmost. Anyone who reads this number also knows that the leftmost digit has the biggest place value. This is an example of a bigendian convention followed in daily life. The littleendian way of writing the same number would be to put the units digit in leftmost position   . A person following placevalue notation who is not alerted of this special ordering would assume the number was three hundred and twenty one. Endianness in computing is similar but performed on groups of  digits instead of individual digits.gtgtImage iInteresting Byte order mark | Bit numbering | Date and time notation in Cyprus | Date and time notation in Greece Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfqvmvg oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfqvmvg.

500054,0,t1_cfuhzng,You want to store the word in the word slot.  The hash is used to determine which bucket in your hashtable is used.As an example lets say you have hashtable  so youve got  buckets.  You read in the word apple and your hash calculation gives that a hash of .  You would then add your word to hashtables linked list.So you arent sorting words per se you are putting them into linked lists under each bucket of the hashtable array.,cs50,cfx3yh3,1,t5_2s3yg

558679,0,t1_cg3r7je,Actually what you post about the  being skipped doesnt necessarily follow. Clearly no transformation is being applied but since  is two characters and ab is  characters you may still be stepping through the key and it just happens to synch up for the next zz.So I suggest you look at how you advance through the key because it looks to me like you advance through the key whether the target character is alpha or not. That will give you incorrect behaviour for the single space and hide the error when the nonalpha section is the same length as they key.,cs50,cg3s1im,1,t5_2s3yg

I tried to get around that with an if function if the EOF is reached free it  but it does not work.  I think because the main while loop finds the EOF and skips right past the inner if function checking for the EOF to free the node.  thanks for taking a look at my issue.,cs50,ci24hwp,1,t5_2s3yg

1352157,0,t3_29kjgt,I dont know if it would cause a seg fault but youre calling isalpha with a char string and it expects a single character  int. Also your for loop is more complicated than it needs to be rather than assigning strlen to a variable and then checking that I is less than the variable you can just check i against strlen. Then youre checking isupper and islower without first confirming isalpha for each character. Take care of those and see if youre still getting seg fault.,cs50,cils8uu,1,t5_2s3yg

1515029,0,t3_2bk6dr,I was struggling with this  at first too but I think I got it nailed now. I posted this earlier maybe this will helpIn order to print out x number of spaces or hashes you need to set up a forloop. As we are taught the loop will run X amount of times until the condition is met. In this case we want to have printf spam space and hash a set number of times in a single line and this has to change based on the height of the pyramid.So first thing is to establish a formula that can identify the number of hashes and spaces in a line I recommend watching the walkthrough as the teaching assistant gives a hint to it. This formula can then be used as your condition for the forloop.Ultimately youll have a loop that will repeat itself for each line to build the pyramid. A loop that will give you the amount of hashes per line and another for the spaces per line.As Im writing this I realise Im very poor at explaining and ultimately this is what I am trying to get atRepeat the below for each row of the pyramid until height condition is met Repeat space x amount of times Repeat  y amount of timesI hope this helps and good luck!

2510358,0,t3_2obcgt,A union is like a struct except all its members overlap in memory. They actually occupy the same memory space. So another way to look at it is that it provides two names for the same storage.More than names however the two members can have different types. When you access the variables the compiler will access the same memory location but present it to you with the type you specified in the union declaration.An example similar to your code above    union  uintt first char buffer  twoferThis defines a variable twofer that is a union of two types a unitt and an array of  chars. You can set or read his contents as if they were a bit unsigned int or as if they were an array of chars. But you are accessing the same memory in both cases.    twofer.first    assigns to all four bytes    char a  twofer.buffer  accesses first byte    char b  twofer.buffer  accesses second byteA less obvious example is when the two elements are not the same size    union  uintt first char buffer  twoferNow the union is created large enough to hold the largest member. But they still all start at the same address.  So first now occupies the same memory as the first  bytes of the buffer but the buffer also continues and occupies an entire  bytes.Now think about reading in a block of bytes to such a union and then using this code    if  twofer.first  xffdffe,cs50,cmm8q39,1,t5_2s3yg

Do note that this is not exactly the version I uploaded to the LeaderBoard it didnt have realloc and I think nodes had a char instead of a char so there was only one malloc for the node unfortunately I didnt think to make a copy before attempting optimizing silly I know... hm perhaps Dropbox has the different versions cached for me?. The hash function is just the one that u was using here I dont know where it came from or I would have credited it I havent uploaded to cs yet btw. I did the trie and was happy enough though I intended to go back at some point and do a hash table then I started attempting to help them and figured Id just implement the hash version now so that Id have a slightly better idea of how they might be going wrong. The trie version is slower than the hash primarily I believe due to having to travel through a pointer for every letter which is part of why I hadnt tried to optimize it not to mention the last time I attempted CS I gave up on the speller due to dereferencing NULL and just didnt understand what I was doing wrong that was  months but I didnt want to get bogged down and quit again.gt just done rough ran about   or  timesgtgt cs trie          .   .  mode is .gtgt hash no realloc    .   .  mode is .gtgt hash with realloc  .  . mode gt possible LeaderBoard hash  .  . mode .It seems Dropbox DOES cache the old versions apparently dictionary.c is on v.  lol Id be more sure of the LeaderBoard code if I knew the exact time I uploaded speller cough uebobtron cough thanks?!.edit btw perhaps you could look at my threaded version of crack Ill send a pm if you do want to lol,cs50,cp56tu0,1,t5_2s3yg

5021952,0,t1_cura4kg,Another similar example which may help in the understanding is this function to determine the length of a string.  rather than using the strlen function from string.h    int stringlengthconst char s            const char p        for p  s p p        return p  s    If that is cryptic lets walk through it.  First we create a char pointer called p.Now the for loop which first sets p to the same pointer as the string we have passed in.  The condition p means keep executing the loop as long as p isnt  i.e. not at the end.  And the increment simple increments along the string.  Once that loop ends p will be pointing the end of the string s.  So returning p  s simply subtracts the pointer address of s from the address of p.  This will give us the number of chars in s because p is length chars away from s the beginning of the string.     ,cs50,curc4zx,1,t5_2s3yg

5171796,0,t1_cv9bf6h,Really? I remember defines being mentioned very early but perhaps it was by pset . Yes thats true I never claimed that defines were more flexible than variables that is absolutely not the case. As to whether a variable gets loaded into a register this is completely up to the compiler and depends on the optimizations it makes. In such a small program switching to defines is meaningless maybe saving  CPU cycles but still good practice.The array idea is a smart one but declaring the variables const in that case would be a good idea for larger programs which is obviously not mentioned by pset,cs50,cv9e405,1,t5_2s3yg

5551754,0,t1_cwl7kj0,How much time it takes for the final project depends on what you pick for your final project. I wouldnt say they get much that much harder. Hardest thing for a lot of people seems to be actually understanding pointers and their usage this includes linked lists and more advanced data structures like binary search trees tries and hash tables which are built like or built of linked lists. Once you finally really get pointers you will always get it ... there will still be hard stuff but youve made it over one of the bigger humps in the beginning of the learning curve.The other thing you might focus on is recursion. Pointers and recursion. So if you dont have any of the suggested books I suggest that you procure them in some way. Read the chapters in Programming in C about pointers which also explains linked lists and such. Do some of the excercises in that book. Same thing with recursion. I also recommend the KampR book where they discuss tree data structures and how to write recursive algorithms involving said data structures. ,cs50,cwl8v7x,1,t5_2s3yg

There is an array of pointers and each represents one letter but it is the mere existence of a pointer stored there that represents the presence of the letter. And there is some subtlety around the isword field that makes it a little trickier.Both ways are doable. You might want to start with a hash table and then do an implementation of a trie afterward.,cs50,db57it3,2,t5_2s3yg
9976167,0,t3_5ific7,Im a novice myselfjust completed pset yesterday so might be helpful if someone more experienced validate this. I think the key should work with both lower and uppercase alpha chars in it seems like you are converting the key to upper. And then using the same key value to encrypt the whole message you are looping through the whole message with the same key  the length of the keyis your output longer than the message??Then remember that you should only go to the next char in the key only if the key was used i.e. on an alpha char you are using the same key value on the whole message and then increment the key char regardless and again using that key value on the whole message. Maybe create a counter for this?Also not sure why you have if j gt strlen key          j     when in your for loop you havefor int j   j lt strlen key j,cs50,db7x81v,1,t5_2s3yg

10034051,0,t1_dbbdbz3,At first the program is in main and abspath is declared there so you can think of abspath as a name pointing to a block of memory containing garbage for now like this      abspathmain gt  BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains garbage  Then the program enters the function and you pass a copy of abspath as an argument. This copy in the functions local scope will point to the same block of memory that the abspath variable in main is pointing at like this       abspathmain gt BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains garbage lt abspathcopyfunction  But then you do this abspath  strtokreqcpy search  This will make the local abspath pointer point at a piece of reqcpy like this abspath in main will remain unchanged       abspathmain gt BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains garbage      reqcpyfunction lt abspathcopyfunction  Eventually the function will reach its end and return. Any local variables will be destroyed      abspathcopy is destroyed reqcpy is destroyed.      abspathmain gt BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains garbage  See? the block of memory inside main was never touched thats why the program failed.Now when you strcpy this is what happens       abspathmain gt  BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains garbage lt abspathcopyfunction  strcpy is like saying hey go to whatever block of memory the first argument is pointing at and put there a copy of the string the second argument is pointing at. So after strcpyabspath TOKEN      abspathmain gt  BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains copy of TOKEN lt abspathcopyfunction  Eventually the function will reach its end and return. Any local variables will be destroyed      abspathcopy is destroyed token is destroyed thank god youve made a copy of it      abspathmain gt BLOCK OF MEMORYcontains copy of TOKEN  Got it?,cs50,dbfgoyv,2,t5_2s3yg

10148330,0,t1_dbu9rqj,Thanks for these ideas.  I have had a go with factoring out some of the repetitions.  It has reduced the length of the program which is good although there are some errors I need to fix.  With the modulodivision loop I guess I could simply run the loop of modulo and then divide rather than expressing all the individual lines.  Perhaps I could set up some variables to capture the numbers on the loop?  I was going to attempt this from the beginning but I just cant wrap my mind around how to go about this at the moment.  Perhaps when I become more comfortable with some of the options it will be clearer.,cs50,dbubw0w,1,t5_2s3yg
10198383,0,t1_dc00stu,Well without looking at your code directly I think the problem is that you are asking the user for input. What I can gather is that you wrote the code in such a way that when you run it it asks for a string to encode. But the code checker is dumb doesnt know how to ask. I think you should try to comment out the part that asks for input and print output instead. Im a bit rusty in C but as I remember in CS they shouldve thought you how to capture input automatically and not ask it from user. As you can see all the errors are identical and all say that the program expected output not being asked to write something I. E. input Thats my c on the issue ,cs50,dc01km2,1,t5_2s3yg

Is the sum of the bytes in the files very close to the size of the raw file?

10634159,0,t1_ddcr076,A module is a Python program you import into another program. To test this out try writing two scripts  foo.py and bar.py.   In foo.py write a function or class that prints something to the screen. Then in bar.py you can use import foo to make that function usable from bar.py. Try playing around with this yourself I generally find thats the best way to get your head around these things.

Run your code and create a resized file run their code and create a resized file then use the utility like this    cspsetpeek myFile.bmp theirFile.bmpand it will show you the headers from each file side by side and even show in red which ones dont match.If that looks good you can use xxd to dump your pixels out and check them.,cs50,dgy6ehx,1,t5_2s3yg
