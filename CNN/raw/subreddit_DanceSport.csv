4733312,0,t3_3fr92w,There is considerable disagreement on this topic so let me give you an overview of the two opposing arguments and a little bit of happy medium to finish it off with.Having one coach not many is better. One coach will get to know you and your dancing. Because of this familiarity his lessons are geared toward improving the overarching quality of your dancing. You come in today with problem X but he knows you often have problem Y and Y is causing X so he can fix it whereas others cannot. He becomes more than just a teacher he becomes a mentor and a friend. He knows you and believes in you and actually wants to help you not just anyone who pays him to be the best.Having many coaches not one is better. There is no correct way to dance and what has worked for one person may not work for another. By having many coaches you are able to explore what dancing really is and learn what works best for you. Instead of staying sheltered under one coach seeing all dance through his lens and becoming a carbon copy of him you are able to take the best things from each coach and combine them into something new. Sometimes something one person says doesnt make sense but when you ask someone else all of a sudden it works.Middle Ground. There are good reasons to have one teacher and good reasons to have many. A middle ground argument would say that there is a difference between a teacher and a coach and that it is important to go out and learn from many people but you should always have your coach who knows you best and who believes in you.Ballroom GuideResources for Dancers,DanceSport,ctr6cqt,1,t5_31klx

4900281,0,t3_3hzu0i,newcomerbronze level probably foxtrot because theres a ton of outside position and heel turns which are both hard for dancers of this levelsilvergold level hm Im the least sure about this one. I wanna say tango though because the quality of movement is very different compared to the other dances and its easy to get into a mindset where every dance feels the same but tango needs to be very different.novice level almost definitely quickstep because the hops are the most different from syllabus whereas the other dances feel pretty similar to how they were in syllabusprechamp and higher probably waltz for most couples because of the extreme rise and fall the extreme shaping and sway the control the spinning etc. Most of the other dances exaggerate some of these aspects while doing less of the others. In waltz you have to do them all.edit slightly better formatting,DanceSport,cuc7wch,3,t5_31klx
4952189,0,t3_3iqpms,I think you are talking about the BosuThere are countless exercises you can do with this ball but youre talking about balancing. You can balance on the ball with the flat side up or the flat side down  each will improve your balance but each will do that in a different way. Using these balls will do two things for you hone the neuromuscular connections in your legs and strengthen your stabilizer muscles.When you first get on you will be using a chair or a person to keep you balanced. It is dangerous to do this for the first time without help. Place the ball flat side up and step one foot right in the centre of the circle. Holding onto your aid bring the other foot on so that both feet are together. Now slowly inch both feet away from the centre so that you are standing normally and are balanced. Chances are you will wobble like crazy but you will find after a few attempts the neuromuscular connections between your brain and your feet adapt and you can balance yourself.The more you do this the more it trains the small stabilizer muscles in your legs. Studies show that lifting weights improves your ability to lift weights and balancing improves your balance duh so the best exercises you can do for your ankles as a dancer are balancing exercises like these.Once you get good you can play with going on the balls of your feet going on one foot and going on the ball of one foot.Disclaimer BallroomGuide is not responsible if you fall off the Bosu and break your neck.Ballroom GuideResources for Dancers,DanceSport,cuirht9,1,t5_31klx

6125520,0,t3_3zffgg,A few years ago I had just gotten my first open routine. Naturally it was Quickstep since we had really looked out of place dancing syllabus Quickstep in open events. For those of you who dont currently dance open Quickstep it has hops and jumps and runs and it is all really hard for a newly open dancer to manage.We were doing our hops and runs down the long side approaching a corner and there was a mass of people congested there. I didnt know what to do because I had no idea how to use floorcraft in open Quickstep. I gritted my teeth followed my routine right into the middle of the cluster of people and prayed.By some miracle I zipped right through the centre of the huge cluster of people leaving them all behind and having the rest of the floor open for myself. In  parallel universes I crashed and broke my leg and possibly the legs of other people as well but in this universe it was awesome!,DanceSport,cylwoxh,3,t5_31klx
