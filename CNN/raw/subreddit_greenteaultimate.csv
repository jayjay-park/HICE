From the college classroom of GODS NOT DEAD to the public square in GODS NOT DEAD  the name of Jesus is welcomed less and less with each passing day.This is such an angry little movie disguised with a misleading happy face. Josh Shane Harper is a freshman assigned to Professor Radisson s Kevin Sorbo introductory philosophy class. He s been warned early on that the prof has a target for Christians in his clas.s Sure enough on day one Radisson offers his class a tempting offer if they will turn in a slip admitting God is dead then they will automatically get a good grade and the class will move on to other thinkers. Josh can t do that so Radisson challenges the coed to prove the existence of God over the course of three classes.There s no way a dean would allow this to stand. The classroom and higher education in general is meant to provoke discussion especially for a philosophy class. The notion that a philosophy professor would think only in reductive rightwrong terms is idiotic. The entire idea of college as this liberal brainwashing ground that infringes upon the freedoms of Christians a feeling catalogued in the end credits with reported legal cases falls apart when you understand that college is about the exchanging of ideas.That s generally insulting and downright hostile presupposing that the only reason people treat other human beings with kindness and respect is because of religious faith and not you know an innate sense of personal right and wrong. An intelligent case can be made for a Creator but that s not what happens here. Directed by Harold Cronk. This is not an inclusive film that will reach out to those lost sheep.Likewise I don t help a person in need because I want my brownie points I do it because I know it s right. The entire movie exists in such a black and white terms and to keep up with this edict every nonChristian is presented as a terrible often meanspirited human being. The Muslim father believes in God but not the Christian God and so he must beat and threaten his daughter for her clandestine conversion. The superficial businessman has riches but at what price?I don t really know why the Duck Dynasty cameo was necessary but I suppose the filmmakers felt they needed additional star power to lure their target audience. God s Not Dead is a surprisingly mean little film that hides its purpose under the auspices of evangelism. I expected a proChristian message and it has every right to put forward its own viewpoint but the film isn t so much proChristian as antieveryone not already following the same limited interpretation of Scripture. Putting aside the poor filmmaking the misplaced persecution complex and the straw man arguments the most disappointing aspect of God s Not Dead is the illusion of intellectual rigor. The merits of Josh s lessthanstellar arguments are not the point though any person skilled in critical thinking should be able to poke holes in his faulty rationale..   ,greenteaultimate,cxen5cz,1,t5_2tl76
