6820425,0,t1_d0ovk7h,He keeps saying something about wanting to make sure our relationship will be longer term... but I dont want to wait another month Jajka said.For God sake Im right here! Dont talk like Im not I heard Wellingtons voice from the other side. I explained time and time again until Im certain of your commitment Im not touching you. Im a gentleman Im not stealing the privilege of first time awkward sex from you and whoever the guy youll actually fall in love for real with.What makes you so sure youre not that guy? Jajka asked.Well well find out if we wait a bit wont we? Wellingtona replied with another question. It was so rhetoric that I imagined him saying it with a Nicolas Cage face.And what if the next guy isnt like you and isnt the right guy either... what if he takes advantage of me... Jajka mumbled. She was toying with Wellington.A few moments of silence followed her statement then Wellingtons voice crackled my phone. Shit... I didnt think of that...katia responseWellington lost his patience. Shut up and go to sleep. I didnt agree to let you in my bed so you could keep me awake all night.Thats why I asked though... Jajka teased one last time. OK Katia thanks for the help anyway.

7335177,0,t1_d2aww47,uMaxRavenclaw Does everyone understand the plan? Paget asked after we had gone over the plan.Aye Pagetsenpaisama! Chibiko replied immediately.Actually Pagetsenpai we have a question. What are the target priority rankings? Komachan asked over the radio.The Comet shall target the Tiger P because we have the best chance of knocking it out. In a pinch Owlteam could also try but every other gun is definitely going to struggle if not fail completely especially from the front. The Panzer IV is also high priority as well as the Stug and Chito as they have the best crews and dangerous guns. The Hetzer probably comes next. Everything else is low priority Paget explained.Roger that maam! Komachan replied.Alright Nishizumidono were ready! I radiod to the commander.Aye in .........
