3970348,0,t1_cr8tuc7,  You seem to not have read the most important report on human rights abuses in the last decades. Why?  No thats not the same at all as your example. Some witnesses were minors at the time and it at the very least proves these minors were incarcerated for crimes of association. Several witnesses also confirm the same locations serve the same purpose proving their integrity.  Even tourists to the DPRK are reporting signs of malnutrition and starvation. Are they wrong as well? Are you saying there is no preventable loss of life from starvation?  You say youre a supported of the DPRK. That means you support the current government.

5384837,0,t3_3oqvb5,Your company writes college papers for a living and yet you pluralize with an apostrophe see clients above.  Yeah sounds like a valuable service.  Im sorry I shouldnt be so snarky but it doesnt make one confident in your product.I am a nontrad a yr old biology grad student and the skill I find most lacking among my young peers is the ability to write. I am all about the free market but I think you do these students a disservice.  My weakness is math and I know I have to work harder than my peers to get through my mathintensive courses.  Paying someone to do my math homework for me teaches me nothing and leaves me weak in math.However as I said its a free market.  Best of luck to your clients.Edit  Nice save fixing your mistake without acknowledging me.  You missed three more try to find them.

6113112,0,t1_cykgwa5,What motives do you have to think it didnt work out well? Please allow me to briefly quote from The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia since I believe the effects the French Revolution had are summed up quite nicely on there The French Revolution though it seemed a failure in  and appeared nullified by  had farreaching results. In France the bourgeois and landowning classes emerged as the dominant power. Feudalism was dead social order and contractual relations were consolidated by the Code Napolon.The Revolution unified France and enhanced the power of the national state. The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars tore down the ancient structure of Europe hastened the advent of nationalism and inaugurated the era of modern total warfare.Although some historians view the Reign of Terror as an ominous precursor of modern totalitarianism others argue that this ignores the vital role the Revolution played in establishing the precedents of such democratic institutions as elections representative government and constitutions. The failed attempts of the urban lower middle classes to secure economic and political gains foreshadowed the class conflicts of the th cent. While major historical interpretations of the French Revolution differ greatly nearly all agree that it had an extraordinary influence on the making of the modern world.What is so bad about that? Sure it had its flaws and downsides but it basically changed the whole world and it was carried out by just a single nation. Imagine if to say the least all first world nations united in such an endeavor. See it now? Hail Napolen. Cheers.,controversialiama,cykhxpf,3,t5_2x251
6282513,0,t1_cz3qkf9,Thanks for the excellent questions!  Its for food and convenience. It keeps the cockerels calm and nice during their growing period meaning I can grow them to a larger size without them terrorizing my hens all day long. It also keeps the noise levels down and prevents them from fighting and injuring each other. My family hates the flavor rooster meat has and capon meat lacks such flavor which is a huge benefit. I also have a small run of capons who are strictly for ornamental purposes I appreciated their looks but I really cant afford to keep aggressive rowdy roosters around who I dont intend to breed especially those I dont want in the gene pool due to inferior genetics.  I started a couple years back. I cant say exactly when. I really found the concept to be too good to be true when I first heard of it a bird with the beautiful plumage of a rooster the attitude of a hen and a size surpassing both? Really its a shame they cant lay eggs or theyd be the perfect chicken. But overall it seemed like a very reasonable way of controlling meat roosters until their maximal growth was reached and being able to keep ornamental cockerels without them contributing to my roosterhen ratio and the gene pool at large.  My family a few friends and my bosses know. Its not something I hide persay but Ive gotten bad reactions from people before so I only really talk about it if directly asked.  The surgery definitely takes a rather severe emotional toll for me. I mean I couldnt do it as a daily practice. Probably not even weekly. It takes me a couple hours to recover from shaking postoperation and a good nights sleep before I can properly think again. Id probably wager its nearly as traumatic for me as it seems to be for the birds that is to say not soulcrushingly lifeendingly awful but definitely a distinctly unpleasant experience. I genuinely care about my birds and if I could anesthetize them or do the process in some noninvasive way I would but I cannot and the benefits of the process are something I cant pass up. The positive does outweigh the bad  the operation itself is quick and the birds are fully healed in  weeks and the benefits are seen flockwide Im no longer losing pullets each year to roosters piling on top of them and crushing them! Not to mention I must be saving a fortune on antipicking solution since there are no adolescent cockbirds biting and tearing at each others combs. And it saves me having to build an entirely separate bachelor pad for the cockerels an expense I really have neither the time nor money for.,controversialiama,cz3r1vp,2,t5_2x251

8267287,0,t1_d5a0x1n,gt I also see there being an evolutionary basis for the attraction to upperage teens more common among adults.So is this the standard view among the professionals? Only attraction to older teens is evolutionarily adaptive? Even though girls develop prominent sexual characteristics long before then and the age that girls in ancestral times started reproducing was typically younger than that? It just sounds a bit too PC.,controversialiama,d5ayvt2,2,t5_2x251
8300736,0,t1_d5ey0wu,Bagels and children are two different things. There is nothing wrong with eating bagels. Bagels dont have emotions feelings minds etc. Also there is a difference between loving food and loving a person. I am not attracted to bagels because of their personality or personal characteristics. My being drawn to bagels is a function of my level of hunger at the moment and my survival instincts. Not the same with a human being.Having children around me in no way makes me automatically atrisk to offend. I dont have some ravenous urge that consumes me until I fulfill it.,controversialiama,d5f5emd,1,t5_2x251
8854746,0,t1_d7c40sw,In middle school I was attracted to younger boys it was basically always there. Thing is I was in denial until I went to university and left home. Before that I only thought about it when I was masturbating or horny otherwise I tried not to think about it. Im in my s.yes but the last one was  or yrs ago. I have had a few girlfriends but they were all female friends and it just kind of happened. Well they liked me and even though it can be difficult I still liked intimacy with them. I did like them as friends though. I wont do that anymore though I dont feel it is right to trick people like that. Ive also mess around with a gay guy a few times but that wasnt a romantic relationship. I am not attracted to adults at all or girls but closeness with another person still feels nice.,controversialiama,d7c7r8x,2,t5_2x251

9915184,0,t1_dazyptt,gtDid it work out and help the country improve? I would assume not as it was abandoned.It was abandoned but the idea behind it created the Mass Line system which remained in China up until the end of the Cultural Revolution. As Ive already said people would get together and debate in big city centres Ordinary people not Party officials and discuss and debate how the country should be run. The Party used these debates to get an idea of what the people wanted and give it to them so in that sense yes Id say it did work. gtI see so you would argue modern China is a sort of poser?I suppose you could say that.gtWhat is your opinion on North Korea?A corrupt dictatorship. It doesnt even pretend to be Marxist it abandoned Socialism for something called Juche. ,controversialiama,dazz0r9,1,t5_2x251
