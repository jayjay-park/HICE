5306108,0,t1_cvmf7bu,... And yet he continuously plugged it on TFV.. If something is mentioned on the podcast this much he probably owes it to the listeners to provide a little bit more of a wrapup than saying listen to my other podcast if you want to hear about this. ,thefilmvault,cvpx0gt,1,t5_312r5

9956003,0,t1_db3feid,I love the show so dont get me wrong when I say this...I think the issue is the expectation for every movie to deliver on all fronts is fine but what standards they are held to vary by genre.So horror movies as a whole have always been a low budget affair because they are rarely blockbuster films. Once they get a big budget is when the movies tend to fall apart by the standards set by the genre.Animation has only recently earned its way last  years or so past the kids film genre and grown into something far greater with actual writers working hard to make cohesive stories star voices and overall packaging as being for more than just a family. Again expecting the same level of quality in writing from these as you would from a more artistic film is unrealistic.I have come to accept the fact that I enjoy listening to them but there are a few genres I just wont listen to them when they review it.I do have to thank them for turning me on to Frank and God Bless America though.,thefilmvault,db5aj3y,1,t5_312r5

11223528,0,t3_5zjbyl,If you all are thinking of dropping a segment like top  or gambling would you consider a new segment where you watch movies based on genres or decades or directors and comment?  it would be a great way to see old films. ,thefilmvault,df468ox,2,t5_312r5
