6870325,0,t3_49u7cp,Huts were beneficial at first but appears most people in late game dont even bother with them. I try not to level them because of that and focus on others. But to your original question I prefer prince over witch as you can drop it down on the other side of the board to have them attempt to focus on that or use as a counter  ,ClashDecks,d0v29l1,1,t5_3d0tx

9420406,0,t3_59bpp8,Change Hog Rider for Zap Fireball for Arrows and spear goblins for mini pekkaBasically play a giant at the back and build a big push if your opponent plays a quick push like hog play prince to defend then put a giant in front of the prince.,ClashDecks,d9a3nus,1,t5_3d0tx
10006835,0,t3_5iuql8,Tornado instead of arrows and zap instead of spear gobs.In your giant sparky push use tornado against enemy troops to clump them together so sparky can  shot all.Tornado  zap can take care of minion horde.,ClashDecks,dbbx3ri,1,t5_3d0tx
10227667,0,t1_dc3c9w5,These are the videos that I constantly go back to for helptips. How to use ice spirits  OJ  How to use fire spirits  OJ    How to counter EBarbs  OJ  How to build an elixir advantage  OJ  How to chipcycle  OJ  How to chipcontrol  Ash  How to goblincycle  AshIt requires a balance of pressure on a tower switch towers if you have to. This deck can win in OT better than in regular time and stopping any type of push. This deck is an information deck. The first minute try an tease out any type of cards information from the opponent while defending with the least amount you can. If you can keep your opponents elixir mostly in mind you dont have to count it AND what theyve played or will play this deck will be much easier to use.,ClashDecks,dc3d38t,3,t5_3d0tx

10865628,0,t3_5v5e56,Your deck I think is a tad outdated in my opinion because of the rise of executioner still great after nerf. Id say tank exe lightning is your worst nightmare. Which I see a LOT. Im not at k but my cards are way lower and I hang around the . ks with a only  commons rest are  . .So my deck currently is this I consistently  crown when I drop for clan chest with it. Currently climbing up for the chest I alternate fireball and zap because this deck is kinda trash vs sparky which I see a bit of these days maybe try it out? I got to my pb of  with it back when my golem was level  and didnt try and push afterwards. ,ClashDecks,de0pnna,2,t5_3d0tx
10866269,0,t1_ddut89d,Baby Dragz could provide decent cover for Prince.  Fire spirits too are good for running up with him,ClashDecks,de0s1bc,1,t5_3d0tx

11686594,0,t1_dgkor7t,gt although the Giant loses a ton of HP because of Arrows travel timeThats exactly why Zap is better to protect the Giant.  Sometimes you can fire a prediction Arrow but Zap is more reliable and cheaper to offset the  Elixir cost of Witch replacing Musketeer.,ClashDecks,dgkoygo,2,t5_3d0tx
11735557,0,t1_dgq8v8v,Yeah I dont know your card levels so you can try different things.  But youre basically set up to play a control style and Miner alone is too easy to counter.  Ever since Goblin Gang came out most decks prepare for swarms so you have to be more creative than flooding the board with skeletons.,ClashDecks,dgq96zk,1,t5_3d0tx
11741836,0,t3_67h0f2,I had the same problem but after making a lot of decks I just made a great deck that got me out of arena  pretty fast. Here are the cards.Pekka Valkyrie fire spirits minion horde spear goblins baby dragon hog ridder and mini pekka.You can combo the pekka and the Valkyrie to destroy towers the Valkyrie will clean the enemy hordes and the pekka will beat down the tower pretty fast. The minion horde can destroy flying enemies or enemies with a lot of life like a giant giant skeleton or a pekka. The baby dragon is useful because it flies and does area damage so you can get rid of annoying goblinsskeletons without getting hurt. The fire spirits are pretty cheap and deals some area damage they can get you out of a hurry. I sometimes use the spear goblins to attack enemies that fly or to stop some enemies that can only attack one Target at once. And finally use the hog rider and the mini pekka to do a split push at the last minute while you send the pekka with a Valkyrie to a line send those ones to the other line and the enemy is most likely to dont know how to defend.I hope this helps you can find all of those cards in arena .,ClashDecks,dgqytlx,2,t5_3d0tx
11764870,0,t3_67dpll,Here our levels seem similar. Try this deck out it has both the valk and the hog and overall is very free to play. Zap can replace the log. I broke  with lower levels than yours overall.Oh and if your exe level is bad you can also keep wizard and run wizard nado.,ClashDecks,dgtktak,1,t5_3d0tx
