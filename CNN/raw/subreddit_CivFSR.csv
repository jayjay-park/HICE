4430575,0,t1_csog7yz,Bruh Ive already proposed this. Comrade SandFalls is currently getting people to diplomatically join the Communist Party through the rCCParty. It has proven successful in tying multiple factions together in unity. However I still believe that a full alliance should be made to protect our fellow brother and sister nations.Hope to see you around some day and hope you and your people can join our glorious republic. ,CivFSR,csp5vyr,1,t5_37ym4

6310905,0,t1_cz6ywup,Glowstone is too expensive for early game setup. We want those farms set up quickly. Although it would be better to just have those farms there for looks and for quickly feeding the people and large XP farms on the outskirts of the city. ,CivFSR,cz6z9ml,1,t5_37ym4
