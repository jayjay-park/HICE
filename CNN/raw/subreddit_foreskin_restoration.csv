4920453,0,t3_3iaf6l,I dont have a manhood so I cant speak specifically to that.However as you keep your glans covered the skin starts becoming more accustomed to stay in that position. Just like if you stretch a particular part of your body a lot it will become flexible. Furthermore your inner foreskin is probably producing preprecum thats helping your foreskin stick longer.As for the manhood specifically I guess it depends on how you put it on. There is one restorer who uses orings for retaining  but he also puts the oring farther down his shaft to where it tensions the skin and has gotten him amazing progress. An intact man is also wearing  orings on his foreskin trying to stretch it to get to CI he said hes halfway there. This method isnt a grow skin quick scheme but the manhood could potentially be applied a similar way. That being said dont rely on it to carry your way through.

Ive been thinking about upgrading and Ive been torn between TLCX and DTR. Your comparison of the devices is exactly what Ive been reading. I like the TLC and would have gone for TLCX based on past experience alone. What really makes me want to go with TLCX is the size concern you raise. The DTR is made for and modeled from a huge penis. That works for the well endowed and all but if youre not a custom TLC could be better. I agree both devices are similar and both have compelling positive reviews. Some men even get both.

10143753,0,t3_5l3g1c,The only men getting penis transplants are men who had such a horrible accident that they no longer have a penis at all. They dont do it for anyone and for good reason here is why. Once you have received an organ transplant you have to go on expensive anti rejection meds for the rest of your life because there is a high degree of your bodys immune system rejecting the foreign tissue. Which can happen even on these meds . The anti rejection meds carry side effects that can cause major health problems themselves. . This type of surgery is incredibly expensive and pain staking. And even when done by a master surgeon there is a very good possibility that they wont be able to properly reconnect most of the nerves. So there is a good chance you may have less sensation than you do now! The risks and complications are not worth the uncertain and ultimately insignificant gains. There is a company that is trying to develop a way of growing a foreskin from your own tissue. But some of these same questions on skills of reconnecting nerves remain. Its a potential future solution but there so many variables that havent even been addressed resolved or even considered yet that the concept is not likely to be a solution in even  or  years at all if not longer. ,foreskin_restoration,dbtqgy8,5,t5_2wfll

I have great erections for a man my age but with a numb dick climaxing during sex was impossible and I had to fake my orgasms. Jerking off was also very tiring because of the very limited sensitivity available.My frenulum was left intact but my dorsal area was cut relatively tight and I was left with about  millimeters of inner skin on the dorsal area not much to start with.How pleasurable is it now? Very pleasurable. It is like night and day. While penetrative sex was just a mechanical action where I could not climax now I have to slow down a bit so I dont climax too soon. The same when I masturbate. And the best part of it all is that I dont need lube to jerk off. My prepuce is my sleeve. I feel like Ive been granted a brand new penis that works much better than the previous one.My methodology of restoration gets easier as your skin grows.

As my progress continued I made adjustments to my routines and techniques in order to achieve the most naturally looking foreskin possible.Try to imagine how you want your foreskin to look in the end. Im a goal oriented person so for me imagining and looking at an intact penis focused my tugging routines towards such goal. But also be realistic. Dont imagine yourself with a cute tight foreskin opening because that wont happen unless you decide to go for a purse string surgery.
