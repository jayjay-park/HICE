851943,0,t3_23erxf,Just like a wand or staff ceremonial clothing is a tool to help focus the mind for any ritual be that robes a top hat and suit or going skyclad. Are they necessary? Not really but quite useful particularly for beginners. It doesnt even have to be that extravagant it could be as simple as putting on a ring that you only use for rituals.,magick,ch14cuc,1,t5_2qhk1

I integrated his daily routine for a while Relaxation Ritual LBRP BRH Middle Pillar  Circulation of the Body of Light Tarot Contemplation Ritual Technique of True MeditationThen I abandoned the book and moved onto The Tree of Life by Regardie and other books. I still do a routine quite similar to the one he lays out in the first  or so chapters of that book. And his instructions and exercises for getting to know the archetypal elements and constructing of magickal weapons seemed good. ,magick,cheerbh,3,t5_2qhk1
1299549,0,t1_cifpwpv,Ok so my first pair of guides came to me around  years ago  not long after they died in a drunk driving accident. They haVe been with me since and were most of my magick influence pre and post mortem. After them i had a large amount of tuples that i initially imagined were all other astral guardians. Or maybes they were i doubt it because they didnt have much personality outside of what i needed at the time. These guys fell away as i grew  in the Art and tamed my mind a fair bit. One of them stuck around for a while a for a good while i thought id managed to gain an elemental familiar with out knowing how gtgt. Well luckily for me my at the time instructor caught notice because it was a shad eating off my insecurities. Bastards. My first batch of servitors were made about  years ago when i got a stronger grasp on introspection and became more self aware  i used them for simple mental maintenxe really but one of from them i made my first construct he was used to disguise bodily alarms like pain and sleepiness. I made him with the intention of growing and he has stayed with me till now but has gone through metamorphosis most profound. About  years ago the construct was given a persona and artificial intelligence now named titan he gathered energy created basic constructs and supported spell creation.            years ago titans form is made etherically substantial no longer requiring my energy for sustenance he hAs become his own minor spirit and my newcurrent familar     All of my constructs are constantly active aside from Overwing my security eye in the sky vestige i hook remote viewing up too. I use him when Im being sneak paranoid Titan is currently inactive as im modifying him despite his lack of dependency now always room for improvement.I dont interact with spirits that often but the ones i do have garnered strong bonds yes! At this point for me i dont work spells any more i make constructs with multiple instructions to cause the changes i want.Hope thats not too much,magick,ciftdw0,1,t5_2qhk1
1668872,0,t1_cgehhd5,Well understanding of the flow of magical energies requires a big paradigm shift and often comes as a realization of true religion or that god exists not as an entity but as the energy of creation and destruction the serpent spiraling up the singularity of the universe in perfect ballance between all opposing forces. Good and evil light and dark creation and destruction they all become the same to the universe. To seek to expand your individual ego is in direct conflict with the only true divine will which is to return all to one and one to all. Breaking away is possible but rejecting the abyss will probably shatter your psyche. And unfortunately there is no way to avoid the abyss. Once youve started on your magical journey it will call to you and you will be forced to answer. Then you can either submit to divine will and accept that you are a part of everything as it is of you or you can reject it and have your ego stripped piece by piece as you struggle to expand your will in hopes of survival. Its a terrible feat but I wish you luck regardless.Also I would look into the writings of A. E. Waite and Aleister Crowley. Theyre a bit dense when it comes to reading but Weisser concise guides has a book explaining the basics of Crowleys system of high magick which was infinitely helpful when I started down my path.,magick,cjpiu5w,1,t5_2qhk1
3192003,0,t3_2wh21p,I have been working with Yesod for quite some time now.  Ive had all manner of experiencesfrom struggling to get anything to happen to total breakthrough.  My advice would be to consider the steps you are taking leading up to entering the sephiroth banishing prayers etc and experimenting a bit to see what works best.  In my experience changing the conditions changes the outcome.  Also be weary of thinking that something is supposed to happen.  Consider that what is happening is not meant to be understood intellectually but rather experienced on different levels of your being.  It seems like you are already getting results.  So just consider your variables and let the artist within you implement them in new and exciting ways.  ,magick,cosun7q,1,t5_2qhk1

3947752,0,t3_35n5o0,I think its a matter of context. If you raise chickens and you eat chickens and chickens are part of your livelihood sacrificing a chicken means something to that livelihood. It has impact. If you live in the city and have no relationship with livestock other than what you get at McDonalds you shouldnt be sacrificing chickens or goats or anything like that in your practices. You have no connection to it so it means nothing to your way of life and the sacrifice is wasted. ,magick,cr6a0r2,6,t5_2qhk1

All By William Walker Atkinson you can get them online at yogebooks for free.. The Kybalion. The Arcane Teachings. The Arcane Formulas. The Science of Breath. Mind Power The Secret of Mental Magic.  a Series of Lessons  edition sucks. Personal Power of special importance is the Desire Power subsection of this book which deals with how to use loosh in a sense emotions and attention. Psychomancy. Mental InfluenceInitiation Into Hermetics and The Universal Master Key both by Franz Bardon are highly recommended. IIH is very practical but can hardly be used as the only practical material because its missing additional info for better development. Energy Work by Robert Bruce will get you started with energywork and combines with all other practises read everything by Robert Bruce to understand astral projection. Read montalk.net. Skim through Neville Goddards The Law and The Promise to understand creative visualization better as well as read montalks reality creation articles.This should have you covered for a while.

4306768,0,t3_3abhyt,If you want to stick with historical knowledge. There are no Druid texts. The druids according to Greek and Roman sources did not commit any of there teachings to writing. We only know about the druids from these Greek and Roman sources and Irish Welsh and some Scottish mythology and folktale. Ive read most of the former in The Druid Source Book by John Mathews and in Blood and Mistletoe by Ronald Hutton. They amount to only a dozen or pages from a handful of authors. The authors have a distinctly classical point of view and are often relating second hand or worse knowledge a notable exception is Julius Cesar who campaigned in Celtic Gaul and may have actually encountered druids but his take is political and his writing is well know for colored views of other cultures. The latter contains a much larger body of work though it was all recorded after Christian contact often by priests or monks and so is somewhat suspect. Ive usedand a few other sources to make a start on it.It may be of interest to note that there are people including myself that have taken the inspiration of the druids has the basis for a spiritual and magical path. This is often called druidry or sometimes druidism. rdruidism exists though it is not terribly active we are doing a group read of The Mabinogion one of the core texts of Welsh folklore.,magick,csb3jst,5,t5_2qhk1

8516451,0,t3_4wdgfk,no. there is not. but this also shows that you may not fully understand what magick is and what it can do. yes it can help to improve self but theres no such thing as a quick fix spell for anything. do you practice any forms of magick? have you read any texts or done any research? it isnt just a switch you can flip. its a deep meditative and spiritual focusing of the will to change your own subjective reality. expand your research practice meditation focus on your desires and find ways to manifest them but dont ever expect to chant a few words throw around a few symbols and flash! bang! have what you want. ,magick,d6646j0,1,t5_2qhk1

9503265,0,t1_d9k284n,We create our own realities. Defeating yourself before you even begin is a fantastic way to create defeat. Its often the awkwardness that drives people away. When youre sitting there expecting it to fail that subconsciously shows.You can literally be the most beautiful woman who ever lived and there will be something you have to change to be different. Youre not at all perfect at least in somebodys eyes. Its the human condition.Like Miss Iceland being called too fat too broadshouldered to win a beauty pageant just last week.  Do you think she was too ugly to participate?Whatever your physical body is there will always be perceptions otherwise. In the end it seems like thats what youre asking to change with a spell as beauty is in the eye of the beholder anyway by definition a matter of perception. Its a lot easier and more effective to change your own perceptions. Beauty in itself is a form of magic. Physical beauty as you seem to define it anyway cannot be changed because it literally does not even exist.,magick,d9khafd,4,t5_2qhk1
9786293,0,t1_dajcwla,Alright I read it and I disagree with your point more now than I did before. This guy literally just said all art is abstraction. And he said that painting a stilllife realistically is abstraction because it is not actual reality. Thats just not true. Jewish art and Islamic art is not abstract its nonrepresentational. Abstraction is the attempt at creating a physical representation of something nonphysical like love or anger or conflict. If you want to use that authors definition for what abstraction is than thats your choice but lets take that and approach and apply it to the original question in regards to abstraction and magick. Is abstract art more powerful magick wise than nonabstract art?If Saltz is going to say that ALL art is abstract and thats what you want to buy into than what ground does your question even have? Arent abstract art and nonabstract art just the same thing according to you and Mr. Saltz....?,magick,dajdgov,2,t5_2qhk1
