11317068,0,t1_dfeifet,I like to think of Aigamis cube as not the th millenium item but as THE Millennium item. Literally to Shadi everything before pharoh left is irrelevant. His ultimate mastermind goal is to use the cube to change the world and make it a good place making pharoh seem like a tool. Its stated in Seras realization near the end everything was shadis plan. I dont think the cube is really a millennium item but its equivalent to them in the fact it succeeds what their purpose was all along to destroy evil. Its literally the only useful item when you think about it as it actually has a goal for the better of the world and literally can change the landscape as Aigami mentioned as long as theres enough consiounesses while the other items are to seal the pharoh to activate the cubes power for the better of the world cause its really the only relevant item. The fact none of Prana has connections to ancient Egypt but they have this significant power makes them equivalent to Yugi who doesnt have a significant power but had ties to Ancient Egypt by housing the soul of the pharoh and the original greatest of the Millennium items besides the cube the puzzle housed good and evil according to Shadi of course in practicality its useless compared to the cube which is meant for real revolution according to Shadi the future if you may not the past which is the business of the other items belonging to the greatest gamer the pharoh. The puzzle is the past it was used for the shadow RPG a game of fate but which if lost will give the world to darkness while if won will only mean that the pharoh can rest in peace and of course its won making it really a boring game of fate that was really just settling scores of the past while the cube can be used in games that will give the world to light but if lost nothing will really happen at most therell be the boring consequence of Prana losing the power of the cube which happens at the end like the boring consequence of pharoh resting in peace. Well the cube was gonna cover the world with darkness but only when it combined with the ring one of the millenium items thats purely evil like the eye and the rod which got me thinking what if it combined with one of the items that stood purely for justice like the ankh tauk or scale? Not the puzzle according to Shadi it has sides of both evil and justice in it. Yugi lost his connection to Ancient Egypt Prana lost their signifigant power meant for real revolution. The cube was intended to work by Shadi after the scores of the past were settled to settle the scores of the future. Both the puzzle and cube have traces of their power left even after they were supposedly gone Yugi somehow uses the puzzle to call the pharoh back one more time while Kaiba uses the cube in the end as part of his dimensional domain emulator to travel to meet the pharoh. Plus the fact the pharaoh saved Jonouchi from disappearing in Aigamis dimension also contributes to the point that the pharoh hasnt completely rested in peace. Heck he might even be anticipating a duel with Kaiba or Aigami turning into that horrible monster near the end. Aigami even mentioned that the pharoh still has a little of his consiounes lying in the temple of the ceremonial battle and that Kaiba managed to read part of the consiounes specifically the part of Obelisk hence why he was able to draw Obelisk from the ground of that temple.I think the dimensional domain emulator uses the cubes power of travelling dimensions which would mean it still had its power so that Kaiba can go to the netherworld where the pharoh rests and combines it with the power of Kaibas Duel Disk to repel being disintigrated by the cube or any dimension since earlier in the movie he repelled the power of Aigamis cube which was trying to disintegrate him. Or sending him to a lesser dimension almost the same thing really. I think the minutely different energy waves of that dimension as Aigami put it would pretty much get rid of you or turn you into a pile of paticles as Aigami also put it when explaining what he thought shoudve happened to Jonouchi. So its a combination of Kaibas Duel Disk and Aigamis cube. You can see he has the cube when he launches to another dimension and you can see when he appears in it that the dimension is trying to reject and disintigrate him to no avail most likely due to the fact his suit has the tech of his Duel Disk hinted at the fact its glowing blue which is a trademark of his Duel Disk and he uses the disk when challenging the pharoh in the very last second so obviously he has the disk. The cube along the power of dimension dueling can also send you to other dimensions till you become nothing. I think the cube can also make people nothing though and its not just an effect of certain dimensions. Like the netherworld.Also Kaibas technology is always for the purpose of changing the future so he doesnt know how to confront the Millennium items which are for settling the scores of the past. But Aigamis cube is different since its also for changing the future making it more similar with Kaibas Duel Disk then you think and the perfect thing for the disk to be combined to. In fact its biggest similarity with the other millenium items might just be the eye of wadjet. Its MUCH MORE similar to Kaibas duel disk. For starters both the disk and the cube have the power of creating a network that links consiounesses. Also when Kaiba is explaining the disk to the world he quotes something directly from Shadi that Shadi said when he was explaining the cubes power to the plana kids. That it will create a world that transcends discrepancies that include the boundaries such as race borders and even language. Both Kaiba and Shadi said that directly. Plus Kaiba talked a lot about all the foolish wars humans have been in which wont be the case when his disk has changed the world while Shadi and Aigami talked about problems of fear including about rulers who take whatever they want with nothing to fear while Shadi explains thats not the case they do have fear similar to how Kaiba mentioned even the victors of bloody wars cannot escape the prison of their own souls.In the end all along it seems theres a link between Shadi the netherworld the pharaoh Kaiba the old  millennium items the th itemAigamis cube and Kaibas Duel Disk with Kaiba and his Duel Disk being the outlier that nobody expected even though its what hes been planning all along his whole life. Its just what was outside of and what exceeded Shadis expectations. Although you cant forget Kaiba had a past life can summon Obelisk and is chosen to do that as well as things like being able to read the pharaohs consciousness lying dormant in the temple of the ceremonial battle which is according to Aigami how he managed to summon Obelisk straight from the ground of the temple even. Id love there to be another movie where Kaiba realizes all the things Shadi had that he doesnt so he actually tries to find the ghost of Shadi who probably lurks around Kul Elna or something cause his ghost was what we saw throughout most of the manga even at the end of the ceremonial duel and then maybe Kaiba finally meetshas a one v one with Shadi who in my opinion is like the GandalfDumbledore of Yugioh.And also way to go Kazuki Takahashi for giving Yugioh fans a movie to ponder about thats confusing as fuck.Other possible ideas for future movies include exploring what happened to the other millenium items besides the ring puzzle and cube. Maybe Kaiba could even get the rod like his past life even though Shadi said its one of the  evil items. What would happen if the other items combined with the cube? Imagine Kaiba getting the rod and combining it with the cube which ever since the end of the movie is now his. Also in transcend game its actually where Kaiba begins exploring the idea of combining consiounesses for his new duel disk And he originally experimented with it by covering the heads of kids with eggs and like the end of the movie he attempts going to the dimension of the pharoh but as he appears closer we see a silhouette of Atem in his eyes and then Kisara. So exploring the relationship between Kaiba his past life and Kisara is possible. Of course at the end Mokuba stopped Kaiba from going since he didnt want Kaiba to hurt himself showing by the end of the movie when Kaiba tries it again he mustve really convinced Mokuba he has a way of surviving. Another possible idea is giving Jonouchi a past life with red eyes black dragon and exploring it who knows. Unfortunately not even Takahashi seems to know where hes gonna take the storyline. Hes only revealed one possible future storyline in the description of this Instagram photoThe description translates toAn illustration of a future tidbit of the movies story.Since graduation four years have passed Yugi as expected wins at the world game contest and begins walking the achieved dream path of a game creator.
