71155,0,t1_cemi1e9,Explain to me how fate handles tension better than dread? Or perhaps how it handles Squad based tactics better than th edition? Resource management better than GURPS? Horror better than Call of Cthulhu? Also let me just turn your argument on its head how is FATE any better than DampD when all it has is codified rules for character motivation?  if codified rules dont matter why are the rules in fate any better then any other games?,FATErpg,cemj377,5,t5_2toez
200439,0,t3_1wemoj,The small number of recommended players is for a good reason,FATErpg,cf19t4e,2,t5_2toez
201106,0,t1_cf19t4e,Yes. Small number of players. Definitely. Do not play tabletop Fate right out of the book with more than three or four players.Elaboration While it is of course possible to run a Fate game with several players Id venture as many as  or so on one GM it becomes increasingly difficult with each player past four and you will need to be wellpracticed roleplayers for the best experience. Two very good reasons In conflicts each additional player requires more and more detailed opposition to balance and so conflicts can easily become very unwieldy  unless some special rule sets such as Very Large Male are implemented. Either youll need many opposing characters or youll have to put more design into them or no conflict will be challenge. A similar problem I like to call th level syndrome in DampD. More importantly though Fate is a narrative game at heart and that requires each and every player to be able to communicate their contributions to the story. With each player past four you either need to take more time for the game or you face seeing people step back from the game and contribute less than they would with fewer people.And mostly I once played a game of Fate with  or so players and it was absolutely horrid. That said most of the players and the GM were new to the game.,FATErpg,cf1ck16,3,t5_2toez

The players were wanted by the authorities for reasons I dont remember and were hunting down a magical conductor who had somehow stolen the original Song that Doesnt End with the intent to unleash it on the world to drive everyone to madness.,FATErpg,cfp601z,2,t5_2toez
660379,0,t1_cgfb8fc,Yeah sorry I did a quick scan of the doc and read the Cyber heart section rather than the text above which goes into more detail about the heart. But that just raises more questions. You said you wouldnt want to rely on batteries for each augmentation yet a capacitor serves basically the same function as a rechargeable battery and the text implies it needs recharging at a wall socket on occasion and if it is just that why give it blood filtering properties and let it replace the function of a heart? The heart doesnt send electrical signals like a capacitor it pumps blood they arent even related. And I assume it can filter blood because that is what the text says it can do. Sure I can change it but thats what I was suggesting anyway and you seem to object to.If an individual aug should be more expensive why not make it more expensive then in stead of having an up front cost? You cant tell me Cyber Eyes are worth  refresh when they give  to Notice and an Aspect that could easily be got through equipment at no refresh cost. Not forgetting refresh is effectively a higher cost than a stunt anyway.I dont feel a need to weaken cyberware as where it exists the campaign world often has cheaper easier ways to get the same effect. Cybereyes can be mimicked by smart goggles razor nails by a monoknife subdermal armour by Kevlar vests without it costing refresh. ,FATErpg,cgfc2er,1,t5_2toez

1281078,0,t3_28r3rv,Future Olympian is a great high concept. High Concepts in general are a way to get milage out of any situation that seems like it would relate to your character but isnt covered by your aspects so just about anything goes when it comes to potential invokes and compels. Ill list a few with some examples.Invokes emphasis on the OlympianGain a bonus when performing an athletic activity or adding athletic flair to a normal activity She holds back a closing elevator door by throwing a school book like a shotput. Gain a bonus when a more competitive attitude makes the difference When rolling against a foe to see who can get to an artifact first. Gain a bonus when in a chase scene and physical endurance and speed are critical Shes pursuing a fleeing foe down a stretch of road hurdling over parked cars.Compels Emphasis on the FutureTake a penalty when going up against older competitors whose experience and physical training outclass her own. Have her dreams dismissed by those who believe them to be impossible Have parents or friends fail to accommodate the sacrifices she has to make. Take a penalty when circumstances risk putting the dream in jeopardy She may hesitate when pursuing a foe means risking a spinal injury.While the other aspects are perfectly adequate in my personal opinion they suffer from being too general. Im sure they effectively describe the character but given that you took the time to make this thread I believe that you have already realized that they fail to suggest clear uses during a game. Its hard to relate a general aspect to specific circumstances and your High Concept already covers a broad spectrum of situations so dont be afraid to get more specific with your other aspects.With The Price of Dreams it would likely be easier to pick a certain specific price that the character is paying during the course of the game. An possibility would be something like  Early Mornings as in the character gets up early for training every single day. That has a much clearer downside. Though she maintains high energy levels through athletic ability and good eating shell still wear out at certain times. Maybe she often falls asleep in class or maybe she starts running out of steam when magical girl activities wear late into the night. Maybe she pulls an allnighter and sleeps through her morning training routine disappointing her trainer or anyone else supporting her in her dream. Still it has some upsides. She can get by on very little sleep. Shes at the top of her game in the early morning. Anyone trying to sneak up on her while she sleeps might run into her already halfway done her morning routine. And of course as your mentioned the fact that she regularly pays a price for her dreams means she is ready to inspire other to do the same.Some other ideas for troubles that showcase a specific way of paying the price No time for fun no time for friends cuts class to train constantly carboloading its lonely at the top of the pedestal cant slow down.The Secrets of Glory on the other hand seems like a great way to connect an aspect with the game world. It would be great to get together with the GM and create a rival or even friendly NPC that cheats to get ahead while your character knows their dirty little secret. The minute that it becomes the Secrets of insert name heres Glory it suggests uses in the game world. That rival might outdo you but your character also knows how to cut them down if only she could get some solid proof.Alternatively if you want to keep it applicable to a variety of characters that you might interact with although I would question how many characters secretly getting ahead by illegitimate means are going to present themselves in a single campaign then Id get specific with the how instead of the who. Exactly how does your character spot the tells of these methods? You could come up with a specific drug that is currently popular in the game world that has a telltale sign like twitching muscles or yellowed eyes that usually goes unnoticed by everyone but your character. Or your character could be part of some sort of junior antidoping association and has received special training but everyone knows shes a narc. Anyways I should end by stating that aspects are a very personal thing so feel free to disregard all my advice if it isnt striking your fancy. The most pressing issue is to come up with something that you feel like you can comfortably invoke and suggest compels for every session. This means even if you decide to take any of my advice youll have to play around with phrasing and come up with a fair amount of potential uses on your own. Try to involve your GM in the process as knowing exactly what a player expects from an aspect is crucial to running a good game. Happy gaming!,FATErpg,cidql8p,5,t5_2toez

My WOD experience doesnt really seem to have much to do with resources but perhaps weve played different parts of the system.Most humans are constantly worrying about money in real life.

2904403,0,t3_2tcz4z,My group is exactly in the same situation. We havent gamed in years  and FAE is new too us all. Weve played two sessions. The first game we played we made the world together as we made characters. I borrowed the three phase character generation from Fate Cores rules. It was great fun because everyone contributed to different aspects of the world. Remember to help the players to contribute to the games creation. Once they create things in the game their invested more in it  and have a great time playing. Ive asked them help in naming NPCs and will let someone with a particular aspect be the resident experton that aspect. For instance someone who has an aspect involving a particular town can be the expert on that town creating other aspects about the area.  I made a map and gave the players homework to choose some names  locations and aspects for towns  cities  and other geographicals they get to place on the map. Ill do the work of integration of the ideas with their help. Much of these ideas came from reading on reddit blogs on Fate and from reading Fate Core which goes into more depth on how to play Fate well lots of great ideas to borrow. Also  every session I  make a teaching plan and go over some game rules. I also review what was learned last time  and correct any rules mistakes we made last session. Im allowing corrections to characters as needed. For instance we understand aspects better and better each session so weve helped each other in rewriting them. Probably most important is my personal aspect about new things try it for  days or your money back. It takes a while to understand something new  and sometimes the only solution to understanding involves spending more time doing it. ,FATErpg,cny8iso,1,t5_2toez

2993678,0,t3_2ufdgq,One thing you might consider is the entire nature of compels. From your descriptiongt socially inept can receive a Compel when in a social gathering to actually ruin the event and make it more complicated for everyone... just to receive FP. That seems a bit hardcore.... implies that you consider compels to be serious things. They are but as a game master you get to dictate how much the socially inept is impacted by their compel. It takes a lot to destroy a social function having one person making it unfun for everyone usually isnt enough. Yeah there might be a bit of a beating or a pissed off person but that is just an opportunity for some more fun trying to handle that problem.When I played Exalted we called the Limit Break a Limit Opportunity. It was a chance to just have fun and do something so utterly wrong that everyone had fun. Much like watching a train accident but without anyone really dying. Conflict is the nature of gaming and compels are just one way of adding that mix as part of the narrative.One reason I stopped playing Exalted besides moving to Iowa is because the game is about just succeeding. You are awesome until there is nothing left to be awesome and then you go somewhere else to still be awesome. We loved limit breaks simply because it was a flaw a limitation that made the rest of the time more glorious.Now you may do it but I found the hardest thing for most players is embracing failure. Succeeding in spite of failure is probably the greatest thing. So ruining a social event because of a compel may lead to a fun adventure something to remember and to feel satisfying when your players finally figure out how to overcome it.,FATErpg,co8ajpb,1,t5_2toez

Use Compels to add interesting and unexpected complications to the characters life and youre golden.Many GMs also dont call for enough rolls in Fate but thats subjective. The appropriate number of times you go to the dice is going to vary between players and groups.One problem the folks at Evil Hat have is theyve got multiple rulesets running around in their heads Fate Core Fae Dresden Spirit of the Century ATomic Robo etc. add to that all the different tweaks that were tried and abandoned during the game design and keeping everything straight has got to be challenging.,FATErpg,cp6jfkr,8,t5_2toez

3912372,0,t3_357xij,A good idea here is to keep in mind how the player wants this aspect used against him. Keymaster Unlocker of Secrets. Two related titles that hopefully get across the point that secrets can be used to compel him to do something. Maybe a person with those titles run into their own troubles event based compel.You said that the aspects you had come up with are vague sounding. A good way to focus the aspect is to think about the stuff the player wants to solve the puzzle to get or the types of mysteries they are after.Treasure Seeker That is a bit broad but it focuses the puzzle solving and mystery thing onto treasure. This is a behavior based compel a treasure seeker wants to get there hands on some treasure.Explorer of the Open SeasThis could be more specific Explorer of Tortuga Isles but it focuses the ability to solve puzzles or mysteries to being tied to some location. The player is driven to find any information on the location or mystery they are looking into in that location behavior compel.Just a couple ideas I wanted to throw out there bro.,FATErpg,cr28ux5,3,t5_2toez

In the timeline were set in  years before Episode IV A New Hope the official canon is that stormtroopers were receiving rushed training to help maintain the Empires rapid expansion. This may actually be a bit overpowered for default troopers but I want to establish that fighting the Empire head on is foolhardy. You need to be strategic. Working on balancing it so that they can easily take on Stormtroopers in an even fight but fighting a squad is a worthy opposition.

On the other hand you want to reward players that have put effort into being observant and spent skill points on skills like Notice and Rapport. So finding a balance is important.Just to clarify the roll for the tidal wave is to see it coming and act in the surprise round and have  action to act. When the wave is about to hit everyone will see it despite the distractions and still get  action.As for getting the characters invested in the world a failed social or gather information check does not prevent them from finding out the story. That sort of information fits well into the conclusion of the adventure after they check for any survivors or the spirit gets a dying speech. But because the information would aid them in the conflict but is not necessary it becomes a good opportunity for a skill check to reward players that want to know and roll well.This was our intention in writing this adventure at least.

7510962,0,t3_4i49ul,Thank you so much for the responses everyone! Youve given me new material to work with after a funk of several months and Im thinking like crazy!I will be honest and say that I had already looked at Diaspora and been very turned off by what I saw  partly because I am personally not at all a fan of hard scifi but also because these rules are intended for a group of new gamers who are also new to the k setting and including a minigame as complicated as the Diaspora ship combat rules doesnt seem like it would be good for them  Id prefer to keep this functioning on more or less the same rules as normal gameplay thats what I like about FATE anyway!. I dont like almost any of Diasporas ideas but the way it handles ship stats is really good and goes a long way to helping my concerns about stats getting out of control.andanteinblue I read through your FATE k ruleset and while in general its too granular for my tastes its an impressive effort nonetheless and I have to say  your use of the Diaspora ship combat track as much as I dont like it is the only thing I have seen that actually manages to get the facing concept that is so traditionally important to k into a FATEbased game. Your way of handling broadside weapons is fucking ingenious and Im trying to figure out now if theres a way to include it in a game that doesnt have as much strategic complexity. Also your idea that the captain can pass out her fate points to the workings of any system is fantastic and I will absolutely be stealing it.halfdragondire I like your setup a lot too but I have not read Atomic Robo so Im unfamiliar with some of the terms. I am familiar with the Mode system but Ive never looked into it in depth I might consider doing so though  your phrasing reminds me of the categories of Endeavors in Rogue Trader Trade Military Creed Criminal and Exploration and I like that a lot. Also your way of handling zones and maneuvering is pretty much what I was thinking after reading Sails Full of Stars which uses something similar.I like your structure a lot  could you or anyone else advise me a bit about what using Modes as opposed to a more traditional list of skills to pick from does for a game and what its benefits are?overwilliam thank you both for the compliment and for your effort and I honestly think that if I ever run either a space adventure game that involves smaller ships more on the level of Firefly or a k game that isnt Rogue Trader and thus isnt going to feature starships as a major gameplay element I will use something very much like what youve suggested. But in situations where modeling the ship as a location for players to exist in would actually be required I dont foresee the players actually being in the same place very often its more likely that the captain will be on the bridge barking orders the seneschal will be off somewhere encouraging the crew the arch militant will be leading boarding parties while techpriest is running around god knows where trying to repair anything that gets damaged. So it seems to me like a waste to base this important element on locations that the players arent actually going to be sharing with each other very often.The suggestion Ive gotten from several people to make Shields a stress track instead of a defense roll is brilliant and I would not ever have thought of it myself in a million years. I can immediately see how it would work  a ship has a Shields skill but instead of rolling Shields as a defense roll rolling Shields regenerates some amount of the ships Shields stress. That gives ships some durability which helps enable the tense broadside slugfests Im hoping to evoke. And I can instantly think of how this makes lances work in order for a ship to do actual damage to another ship and inflict hull or crew stressconsequences all of a ships shield boxes have to be checked  but lances can only ever check one Shield box at a time whereas batteries can check multiple. Immediate question thats raised though would this all be based on the same skill? So a higher Shields skill both makes a ships shields stronger and makes them regenerate faster?This also presents a weird issue though  one that funnily enough existed in almost exactly the same form back in the original Battlefleet Gothic. In that game there was no such thing as a tohit roll really  or more specifically no ship had a higher or lower chance to hit than any other ship. Chance to inflict damage on an enemy ship was determined by the target ships armor not the gunnery of the attacker. But it was still necessary to wear down shields before dealing hull damage to a target ship. Which means that a ships armor was determining an enemy ships chance to hit it before the armor was actually possible to damage. Ive never liked this at all and Im not a fan of it here either  several people and rulesets have already suggested using Hull as a defense roll which is probably a good idea if Shields arent going to serve as one. But I really dont want to remove defense rolls from the equation entirely that feels like itll make ships die too fast. Any ideas on this? Maybe the defense roll just doesnt work until the shields are down? That feels like it would make shields too easy to strip.I really really like Sails Full of Stars Conditions rules for crew casualties but when I read about them recently Id also hoped to use Conditions to represent subsystems. My previous draft just used advantage creation with weapon systems or boarding generally to represent disabling enemy systems an important part of k space combat traditionally but that never quite worked because it meant you were hitting enemy ships with weapons that werent causing any stress. I feel like Conditions would represent this much better with different boxes applying to different systems thus causing a ship to slowly be disabled as damage is dealt to it but is having both a set of crew conditions and hull conditions a good idea? Im not sure.Ill definitely get to work on my next draft though thank you all so much!,FATErpg,d2vyj53,2,t5_2toez

I especially like the roll probability section.  So I coded a GM command that allows you to see each cheat sheet. Very handy.,FATErpg,d4zye54,1,t5_2toez
8322452,0,t3_4tgy6f,You can find ad hoc rules in the Fate System Toolkit It suggests a kind of duel in which you cant perform attacks until you gain the upper hand which means succeeding with style. To do so you have to keep creating advantages. After gaining the upper hand you can finally attack until the enemy succeeds with style. As the toolkit suggests youd better use the stressfree variant for this kind of conflict.,FATErpg,d5hv1xa,2,t5_2toez

8625202,0,t1_d6jh59c,Well if youre disinherited then the situation that the aspect reflects has changed. Perhaps youre still considered the rightful heir but heir apparent could only be understood ironically. The aspect should probably change to address the change in situation.If you created a character to be the heir wrote an aspect about it and the GM just decided to change that on you theres a problem with the game.

One thing that I cant help be suspend my disbelief for however is that if the sun was blotted out and the world succumbed to eternal gloom as you call it life would cease to exist within a short amount of time as temperatures would permenantly drop too far below freezing for anything to live. Even undead would be frozen to a point where while not solid blocks of ice they wouldnt be able to move properly as their joints and such would grow stiff.,FATErpg,dbc47q5,3,t5_2toez
10303037,0,t3_5nhd6m,Ill try and keep my answers short theres a lot to unpack here. That didnt happen.. Use the ellipsis trick. Have your players describe what theyre going to try and do roll and narrate the outcome accordingly. Bert snarls and whips his sword around in an arc to cleave the Black Suited man in half...Okay I got a  which isnt enough and I dont feel like spending a fate point...So the Black Suited Man was waiting for the move and laughs in Berts face as he deftly arches his body letting the sword just barely miss his midsection. You can help them with the narration or allow them to narrate what goes down youre telling a story together. Work together.. I dont like the main initiative rules either so I have them make a normal roll and add the applicable skill Usually notice for Core FAE approach is more situation based. Fights are usually conflicts. Contests are usually nonfights chases actual contests of skill etc. Things will move faster once you and your players get a handle on things. My first round of combat was super slow too. Eventually you get to the point where you almost blink and a fight is over. This usually comes when everyone realizes Fate is more about the story and conflicts are just one small part of it.. You can keep things secret from your players. They dont need to know how the whole story is going to go with all the little twists and turns and shouldnt. At certain points you can reveal this to them and allow the players to work out how their characters will respond.. This is pretty much do whatever you want. Create things on the fly prepare them whatever works for you and your group.. Fiction first. If an aspect implies they cant do something then they cant do it unless they get creative...which they always do. A gas filled room doesnt necessarily mean everyone needs to overcome it to do anything. If they want to negate the aspect an overcome roll will do it. Succeeding may look like hitting a lever and causing the air filters to suck it all out. The enemy could invoke it while they attack a PC since the gas makes it hard to breathe and thus harder to defend giving the attacker a bonus. Vice versa for the PCs.. I would be fine with incorporating firebreathing into an aspect and granting the player narrative position to use firebreathing to do stuff. They might use firebreathing to Fight maybe even as a light source to Notice whatever. If they want to make it extra cool they could build a stunt or two around it to give them a bonus under certain conditions. In a Star Wars game if someone has the aspect Forgotten Jedi Master they can use the Force. No skill or stunt required. Their aspect gives them permission to use the Force. They may have a stunt to make them able to get bonuses when they do cool stuff with the force such as Force Jump  I get a  when using Athletics to overcome an obstacle requiring me to take a leap.A few things to keep in mind. Fate is about building a story. When in doubt let the story and narration dictate what you want to happen and then consult the rules about how you would do that. If something seems odd or you dont like it change the rule. Sometimes youll see that rule change didnt make it better. Change it back for next time. Narrative permission will cover most things. Can a character do something? Do they have an aspect that makes it seem like they could? Great they can do it. Skills and stunts help influence how well they do it.,FATErpg,dcbwkqt,9,t5_2toez
