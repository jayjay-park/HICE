I recently decided to screw it and DL someone elses Ewis  .ini tweaks for ugrid and they seem to run just fine.I managed to revert the ugrid to ugrid save via something i read. Namely load it with  still up dont move alttab change .ini file to  alttab back into the game console resetini create a new save. It seems to have worked.I guess ill leave it alone as everything is running fine with these new settings.Skyrim.ini   SkyrimPrefs.ini   Enblocal.ini   Enbseries.ini   I changed some settings so its based on the cards vram now.

51633,0,t3_1un1ow,Why dont you let us have a look at your mod list amp load order. I know thats what they always say to the newbies and you are clearly not a newbie!  but maybe one of us will have more specific insight into whatever is going wrong.Over the last couple weeks Ive been playing pretty CTD free  maybe one every  hours or so typically right after a quicksave or autosave. Thats perfect for good fun play. BTW Im currently running  plugins on level  character  with about another  sets of nonplugin texturesmesh mods and SKSE scripts. Im driving a Dell u  x  through Project ENB performance version. However it doesnt take much for something to throw the whole thing out of kilter and then Im back to regular CTDs.Four recent examples Back around level  I started getting a lot of CTDs. At that point I turned off a few of my favorite but nonessential mods  stuff like Dynamic Things Footprints Cold amp Wet. They are still in the  plugin list but they are all dormant. That gave me some more stability. Still Id really like to try getting at least Cold amp Wet back into the game! Later on I seemed to be getting more CTDs again so I made the pretty big shift of replacing my TPC graphics overhaul with a pretty strict redition of STEP  and THEN following some VERY tricky instructions to use ddsopt to reduce the size of a bunch of STEP mods. Not just Bethesda stuff  mods too! That made a BIG difference in stability. As far as I can tell that transition made the biggest difference so far. A bit later I seemed to be getting CTDs when I was using maps and menus. That turned out to be a problem with Safety Load. The fix turned out to be simple EnableOnlyLoading  true Im fascinated by economics mods and Ive been looking for a way to get an old mod Economics of Skyrim out of my game and a new one Trade Routes into it. I thought I had it yesterday and played for a while but after the first  minutes of play which seemed OK! I started getting  CTDs per hour. Not fun! With a heavy heart I pulled the new mod put EoS back the way it was redid my proccers and bashed patch  and played for an hour this mornign without any trouble. ,skyrimmods,cekb4k3,2,t5_2sqqh

60933,0,t1_celct2u,As a general rule you should do this anyway with any new mod you install.  When you addremove mods it changes load orders  which change object references.  Each object in the game represents a hexidecimal number.  The first part of this number is dynamically generated based on your load order.  If you install  remove mods then this number changes.  Object reference numbers are baked into your saved game and are not able to be changed.For example you install a mod that inserts itself towards the top of your load order.  You then bring up an old save.  In your save an object reference for a chair will now map to a quest event.  Since these are apples amp oranges your game will not work properly.,skyrimmods,celd8qa,2,t5_2sqqh

95998,0,t1_ceoc3k5,It does have some pretty powerful spells but I think the only one that could be overpowered is the offensive contingency spell which autocasts any particular spell you choose provided you have enough mana to cast it once when you cast another spell. Err has a chance I should specify. It works as a proc and you can go a fight at least if its a short fight without seeing it proc at all.Otherwise it adds a lot of cool spells that are probably a little stronger than the vanilla spells but mostly theyre just more fun. Like an ice spike that does bonus damage if you hit from behind or projectile spell that does damage based on how far away you are or leech seed which is a lifesteal spell but functions by fully healing you when you kill the opponent while its still in effect. It also adds a lot of damage spells that are outside of the destruction tree so you dont HAVE to use destruction to be offensive. For instance that range spell is alteration conjuration adds a spell that does area effect shock damage around your summoned minions instead of around you.All in all it adds a lot of great functionality even for nonmage classes that just want to dabble and if you decide its too strong its worth just upping your difficulty to keep it.Another mod I would recommend is the bound weapon overhaul. It buffs bound weapons a bit and adds a magicka steal effect to bound weapons. It makes the oneand  spell fighting style a lot more fluid. It feels really good to cast spells in one hand while using your melee attacks to keep your magicka up.,skyrimmods,cepcy05,2,t5_2sqqh

160691,0,t3_1vwsmv,Looks like youre running into the upper limit of Skyrims memory management as theres a reproducible upper limit of around .GB memory utilization for Skyrim before it crashes.This is of course discounting the increasing crashing beforehand.Its basically because Skyrim does not handle large texture changes well and suffers for it the more texture memory footprint it takes. Heck I can crash reliably after  minutes by simply going full aMidianborn textures  Immersive Armors  Immersive Weapons  Immersive Creatures.Mod in moderation is my only advice and doing regular savethenquitrestartgame breaks also helps.

233340,0,t3_1wr1ix,I just finished updated all my mods earlier today after a  month leave of absence from Skyrim.  Unfortunately its my girlfriends time to play right now and I dont have access to my current Mod List.  Ill try and get you a copy tomorrow.Here are a few off the top of my head. Climates of Tamriel  This adds an insane amount of custom weather to the game and works very well with other major mods.  From heavy rain to blizards foggy and humid to sunny.  The mod also effects ambient lighting as well. Enhanced Lights and FX  This completely overhauls light sources and ambient lighting.  Everything from candles to the sun its self will play a part in changing how you see Skyrim.  For the best example walk through the entrance to Bleak Falls Barrow before and after it is installed.  Alternatively you can try Realistic Lighting Overhaul. Lush Trees and Grass  This enhances the trees and grass across Skyrim by making them more... well lush.  It works very well with Skyrim Flora Overhaul. A Midian Reborn All of them  The Book of Silence collection replaces all the weapons armors and unique items with hand crafted high resolution textures that will make you stop and admire the random bandits iron armor.  All the others in the series are worth a look at as well. Brown Rocks  It recolors all the grey rocksmountains in Skyrim with a slight brownish tint.  This does wonders for removing the stale cold feeling of skyrim for a more vibrant and living one.  Think the Rocky Mountains.   W.A.T.E.R.  Enhances the water and associated features.  I recommend the option for giving the water a blue tint versus the vanilla green as just like the brown rocks mod it makes the world much more vibrant.There are dozens and dozens more that I use that I simply can not recall their actual name off the top of my head.  Again I will try to get you a list tomorrow.In addition to this there are a few mods that effect gameplay a little bit but are very much worth a look if you want a more immersive or more gritty style of game play.  Interesting NPCs  This is a BIG file but well worth it.  It adds a lot of custom NPCs each with their own unique voice actor.  Some have their own quests others are companions but most are just damned fun to talk to.  I made a wandering bard character inspired by this mod and simply went around Skyrim in search for interesting people to talk to.   Inconsequential NPCs  Like Interesting NPCs this mod adds more characters to Skyrim in order to make it feel more alive without over crowding it.  However unlike Interesting NPCs this mod adds all those people you see everyday but never really see.  Youll come across patrons at a store assistants guards for the carriages visitors skooma dealers adventurers mercenaries orphans etc etc. Cloaks of Skyrim  This adds cloaks and hoods to NPCs that you can buy steal and equip yourself.  They dont add armor or do anything stat wise save looking really cool. Wet and Cold This will make NPCs react to the weather by taking shelter during storms.  It also adds effects such as dripping water when wet or frost on your breath when cold.  On top of all of this if you have Cloaks of Skyrim installed it will cause NPCs to equip the appropriate gear when in a blizzard or a storm. Frostfall Hypothermia  For the Hardcore realist.  This mod will cause you to fear the north as the cold becomes a much more fearsome opponent than any dragon.  Fully customizable to suite your preferred level of difficulty but lets be honest youre not a man unless you are capable of freezing to death.  This mod works perfectly with Wet and Cold as well as Cloaks of Skyrim in case you wanted to make those cool looking ornaments useful. Realistic Needs and Diseases  More Complex Needs  Like Enhanced Lighting and FX vs Realistic Lighting Overhaul these two mods do much the same thing with a slightly different flavor.  They both will give you an actual cause to eat drink and sleep.  You can gain bonuses for a healthy meal or die from dehydration.  You can even go so far as to balance your exact nutritional intake if youre inclined.,skyrimmods,cf4xo1u,1,t5_2sqqh

355655,0,t1_cfhbpba,Yup with a little help from the guys at STEP Community I figured it out. Kind of like what you said this is what I did I added the mod from archive manually then I collapsed all folders.

Then I rightclicked and set it as data directory. Mod organizer gave me the looks good and I installed it. Worked like a charm inexperience was the problem. It was just a texture file mod I should have been able to figure out that dragging the selected textures into the parent folder and setting it as Data would do the trick. Welp lesson learned.

442966,0,t3_1z54x6,Not sure are you thinking of something like a deleveler that removes the highend equipment form automatically showing up on enemies bodies as your level increases? A real popular mod like that is called Morrowloot. It basically restores the loot system similar to how it worked in Morrowind. The highend armor and weapons didnt just come to you automatically when your level got high enough. You had to go out into the world and find it hidden in deep places. I remember in Morrowind coming across a full set of glass armor in the house of some Dunmer noble and I was so excited!There are several versions of Morrowloot mods available. The first one not only made the high end equipment only available via finding their hiding places it also disabled your ability to craft it. There is also Morrowloot Nwah Edition link which I think adds crafting back. And my favorite that I am using Morrowloot E Edition link It is a newer edition than the others more recently updated and it allows you to craft some higherend equipment like Elven Glass Ebony and Orc but they now have racial requirements so if you are not the correct race you have to have a higher smithing skill and training manual to figure it out. Daedric remains uncraftable and super super SUPER rare. When you track it down Oh Wow.Is that what you were thinking of?,skyrimmods,cfqofhs,2,t5_2sqqh

499112,0,t1_cfwz2k8,Hmm yeah Im not sure of which mods you could use to adjust that. I suppose I dont have a ton of experience with followers. Right now I use Jade from Interesting NPCs because shes a decent archer which fills a gap in my strength as a spellblade and she has really high lockpicking. I do feel that followers are pretty balanced for me because they operate with the same rules as I do. They can oneshot and be oneshotted depending on the situation heavy armor can be very effective for them and in my case archers can oneshot mages. Often I find myself chasing down a fast light armor enemy and they can book it with high level light armor and she sits back and drops them with a single arrow. Always makes me smile when she does that. Of course she takes a knee all the time since she uses light armor especially against heavy melee but usually I take on the melee so it works out. I havent used a heavy melee or Mage follower yet really. I imagine melee might be a problem still since the AI is below par but it is what it is.Anyway as for you does AFT let you control followers stats?

657558,0,t1_cgews2e,That usually happens when I am pushing my VRAM close to the limit. Basically the textures and other graphical data hit the wall on the GPU and it has to page some of it out to system RAM to make room. That kills your framerate. But it also tends to happen more in the Whiterun area because that was one of the first areas coded by BethSoft. Apparently it was coded a bit differently and even the code that runs the water in that area is different than the rest of the game.Anyway if the framerate drops happen a bit to much for your taste try downgrading some of your texture upgrades to free up more VRAM. You can also use Skyrim Performance Monitor link to track these details to get a better idea of what is going on.,skyrimmods,cgf0ija,1,t5_2sqqh

807285,0,t1_cgvty4m,gtIve never used Ningheim can anyone vouch for it?Definitely its great. Ive never gone back once I installed it.gtWhys it so popular? She says it makes it much easier to create nice characters  why?Several reasons but the main one is that the Ningheim devs designed the face mesh for Ningheim completely from scratch. Other custom race mods usually use a vanilla race as their base so they tend to end up looking as oddly shaped as the race theyre based on and it becomes extremely hard to customize a face the way you want to as itll always share some similarities with the vanilla race its based on no matter how tweaked. The Ningheim mesh is more of a clean canvas where tweaking character creation sliders has a much larger impact on how your character ends up looking.gt Also I prefer Elven races but I imagine that Cross Racial Features would make it possible to create a vanillarace elf with some of the Ningheim features?No need for Cross Racial Features you can make a Ningheim with elf ears and facial features very easily see below.gt I use RaceMenu with CharGen over ECE due to better compatibility with other mods. Is there anything essential in ECE that RM amp CG cant do in terms of creating faces like this?CharGen already has a ton of features but I find ECE to have very important customization options that CharGen doesnt. Thankfully you dont have to choose one or the other as CharGen includes extensions to add ECENingheim morphs. Youll need the following these can all be obtained at CharGen Nexus page CharGen Core CharGen Morphs this one is optional but more sliders CharGen Morphs ECE and CharGen Ningheim Morphs. Youll end up with some repeat sliders that do pretty much the same thing but they dont cause any problems other than cluttering your character creation menus a bit.gt One of my biggest obstacles is creating a nice faceshape and lips especially from the profile view. You think you have a good thing going on from the front and then you turn her head and Eugghhhhh  ! Not mine just an example. The one on the right. Which is really unfortunate in a game where most of your views of your character are the back and profile. You can clickdrag your characters face around while in the character creator it helps immensely for chineyemouth depth and other tweaks.,skyrimmods,cgw1ji6,2,t5_2sqqh

For example if you play Skyrim with Mod X and create a save the next time you load that save the game will expect Mod X to also be loaded. If you no longer want to play Skyrim with Mod X it is best to unload Mod X by unchecking the plugin under Data Files in your Skyrim launcher and loading a save that does not require Mod X usually an older save or a backed up save.,skyrimmods,cha1or9,2,t5_2sqqh

966125,0,t3_2555p9,Level . Completed Main Quest DB and DG. Just putting around helping to rebuild Helgen and recently started the Civil War line on the Imperial side Civil War Overhaul for the crazy amazing win!My setup approximately  mods. Using Mod Organizer Shesons memory patch ENB with ENBoost TESEdit to clean key esps and to merge mod packages together to squeeze under the  esp limit.My mod setup is built up carefully over quite a while and a couple aborted playthroughs because I kept tweaking my mods. For this game I have not added or removed any mods except for Seasons of Skyrim for a couple months to have a Skyrimwide winter. Changing mods for any reason just asks for trouble. I havent even updated any mods just to be safe. Well not quite. I did update Dragon Combat Overhaul because ApolloDown found a critical bug in his code.I ran into some weird script lag during the Main Quest. Whenever I went up to the Throat of the World for those quest stages my scripts would act wonky for a while. Frostfall would stop updating lag reports were indicating scripts were hanging for upwards of  seconds at times. I couldnt find any way to defeat Alduin the first time without all my scripts lagging terribly for days after. I wasnt sure if I was going to finish the main quest but I finally decided to grin and bear it. Things finally settled down and smoothed back out. I intentionally installed only the most important scripted mods to minimize script lag but something about that quest stage was not happy.My game really only crashes occasionally when trying to save. I have Auto Save Manager and it takes care of all my saves. Once during the final Dawnguard assault my game broke and couldnt save at all. No matter what it would CTD when trying to save. Turns out it is a vanilla bug that never quite got figured out. You have to let your character die and let the game autoreload and that clears whatever hiccup the system has. Worked perfectly.Note Script lag seems to be pretty important to longterm stability. I have noticed in the past that when I had too many scripts in play the game was more likely to break and fall down. If a script breaks it gets baked into the save file and the game will be unreliable after that. There have been a few times in this game when I noticed things starting to act weird and I stopped and backed up to an older save to try again. It always fixed things. So being observant is also important.Oh and save often! This is why Auto Save Manager is so important. Dont use Quicksaves or Autosaves. They are more unreliable. Instead ASM duplicates autosave functionality while using full save files. I have it set to save after combat after resting after leveling up and every  minutes. I replaced the quicksave hotkey to use ASMs save. My latest save in this game is number . But I have ASM set to keep all my manual saves F the  most recent of each of my other save types. So I dont have  save files enough to be able to go back in time as needed.,skyrimmods,che3vy5,1,t5_2sqqh

971521,0,t1_chep44f,The manual installation is pretty simple when you get used to it. Simply extract everything except the data folder into your Skyrim folder. Rezip the data folder by itself right click and select add to archive... and rename the archive SKSE.data then add the archive to your mod manager as a mod and activate it!  Whether you do manual or installer you will still need to manually create an skse.ini for the memory patch. ,skyrimmods,chepz9t,1,t5_2sqqh
972289,0,t1_chesuhk,CTD has become my middle name unfortunately even with a GTX . I really dont want to have to redo my entire load order for what feels like round  but Dragonborn DLC CTDs way too often so I am going to have to. If you didnt mind I would love a screenshot of your load order and perhaps your .ini files as that seems to be important.  I have  mods  in MO and  now in NMM because most textures or mods that need to use SkyUI config will just not work in MO it is a bit frustrating.  I followed STEP as close as I could and cleaned the main files using TESEdit checked it with LOOT too to no avail because the crashes still happens.

977080,0,t1_chfchwn,Well i dont know what you expect. Thats what happens when you download mods that ALL try to DRASTICALLY change the game. Yes you have to think but there are guides out there like STEP and most people dont even want to change the gameplay. At least not enough to cause a lot of bugs or crashes. Avoiding conflicts is simple dont install two things that do the same thing. It really is that simple.And LOOT is probably the easiest thing you can use you literally install it hit Sort Plugins and then Apply the load order because it knows what its doing.If not theres BOSS but its feeling more and more outdated as time goes on and its probably harder to understand.Theres no way around the time investment for modding. If you try to shortcut it you get those catastrophic results you mentioned. You really cant make it easier for newcomers either.

984684,0,t3_25d3vv,uElectricTool brought up some very good points...among them the one that stuck out the most was you want to have your mod list as final as possible before you start a playthrough. Unfortunately there are no real shortcuts to this end. The only way to get a heavily modded and stable Skyrim is by taking the time to do a lot of reading and a lot of testing. The reading is incredibly important for obvious reasons...the testing is important because really the only way to see whats what is to actually see it. Make sure it works by testing anything related to the mod in game. If I install a texture mod I then want to go in game and make sure the texture it claims to replace is there. If I install a mod that adds spells Im going to go to the College of Winterhold and see if the merchant is selling the new spells...buy a couple...kill the merchant with the new spells...exit game. Do this for each mod resorting with BOSSLOOT and rebuilding your bashed patch Reproccer whatever else needs to be rerun when necessary and then checking it in game. I personally have created and deleted many characters named things like Convenient Horses Test Minion. As far as amount of mods per test run my rule of thumb is between  and  depending on the size and scope of the mod.  at a time for major overhauls but you can safely do a few at a time for things like texture replacers. If you take it slow do the research and test things thoroughly it takes less time in the long run. I speak from experience there...Besides the more you do it the faster you get at it. Now I can set up a completely new mod profile in  night versus the  months I spent wanting to figure it out on my own  STEP is a good way to get a solid foundation that looks much better than vanilla and implements the essential stability modstools. Once you have that in place it becomes infinitely easier to build in the playstyle of your choosing. It is not necessary but definitely recommended. Hope this helps!  ,skyrimmods,chg7ssc,3,t5_2sqqh

1122771,0,t3_26xv8t,Skyrim could have updated to a new version via steam updates in which case some mods WILL break. Your SKSE is also probably out of date now. Updating can help fix them but some mods could be unsupported by now there isnt much you can do in that case. Long story short youll want to do research on the larger mods to see if theyre compatible with new skyrimskse versions and will probably want to update a lot of them if theyre that out of date but doing so is likely to break your save. More than it already is I mean. Keep a backup of preupdate.You could try running the papyrus script cleaner on your latest save file made after updating stuff and playing for a few minutes just follow the image with the red squares. It probably wont fix everything but it cant hurt and if it does it automatically makes a backup.It may come out fine but moving mods entire versions up can very easily screw things up Ive had to drop saves because updating a mod to the next complete version number broke their save functions still have them backed up in case a fix comes out in the future.

LOOT does a much better job in general than BOSS but it still derps out on some things...still better than BOSS though. Ive only had to create  user rules with LOOT as opposed to the  I had for BOSS...Edit why downvotes. Edit Metadata is the same as edit user rules but more advanced. And I have less rules with LOOT.

They can dispel themselves as well so your armorup spell dispels itself after combat is done and some magicka is returned to you. create a spell combo which is  spells you have rolled into one cast. A good example will be the firestorm AoE with flame cloak and armor up in one cast. Or summon  muffle  Invis to throw off aggro to your summon... create a spell ring that allows you to cast the spell in the ring via equipping the ring.

Mods that add items and creatures shouldnt be much of an issue you may need to go into a small cell house or something alone and wait till the cells reset. Cells reset after  days in game unless you have a mod that alters this in some way I run faster cell resets because I run on a game speed of  and without the faster cell resets some places take forever to reset. World space shouldnt be of any issue either but you dont want to be in an area that has to be changed so find a small house or cave that isnt being altered by the mod to save in before you install.

No not just referring to the Gopher vid not was it the first time it was brought to your attention. It was a common complaint since version  and I have still seen such complaints pop into your comment section about it. The only viable solution I have heard in other places and its also what Gopher has done is to lower the hparmor so they die to quick to effectively run away. Also adding it to the bugtracker.

And then we could have The high road which would be a network of rooftops that criminals amp the theives guild use to get around the city and it could also include things like abandoned top floor apartments if we added in crowded apartments to cities such as Riften.Goddammit we need someone to start working on riften,skyrimmods,ciiy9l6,1,t5_2sqqh

Now mind you I dont generally get a whole lot of time per day to mod but Id guess Ive got a couple hundred hours in it at least. The Noble Chaurus actually took over a month despite being a fairly short mod but thats because I had to do some level design and learn how to navmesh which is why I now aspiring modders not to skip any of the tutorials. That probably took  of the time I spent on it. Most of the rest was spent debugging the damned pheromone canister mesh in nifskope. I shouldve just gone with throwing a pheromone ball like HL did...Ova the Rainbow took a lot of actual hours but only about two weeks of development because I wanted to release it on Easter which turned out to be a huge mistake because apparently nobody gets on the Nexus on Easter. ,skyrimmods,ciom8ca,2,t5_2sqqh

1529485,0,t1_cj7ycqq,getting the spell the legit way takes a bit of time.  You have to level your restoration to  and go and do the level  quest.  Then you can buy the spell tome that is actually a crafting ingredient to make the resurrection spell.  Next you have to find the spell book that tells you the rest of the recipe.  Its somewhere under the college IIRC.  Then you get the other ingredients and take them all to the riverwood trader.  dump them in the arcanum reactor and pull the lever and poof! out comes the resurrection spell tome.I dont know exactly how much manna it takes but it is probably a lot since its a level  spell.  Still its kind of nice to use if for example Belethor decides to try to kill a vampire by bludgeoning it with his face... and you liked to sell all your junk to him before he went and got himself killed and feel a little bad to see him die.,skyrimmods,cj7zxua,1,t5_2sqqh

1547345,0,t3_2bylll,A crash to desktop that early usually means a missing master file. You may have left over compatibility patches from uninstalled mods or you may not have all the mods a specific mod needs. To use BOSS to check for this when you run it go to Recognized Plugins and under each mod look for purple text that says Requires master file .esm or anything like that. If you want a more time consuming but practical approach uninstall all your mods then slowly install some one by one launching skyrim each time to check for crashes.

Taking things slow and reading everything is essential to modding. If you had been going slow you would have seen the section on Wrye Bash. Simply merging all your weaponarmor mods into one esp without knowing what youre doing...youre gonna have a bad time. Also a merged patch is not the same as merging mods.

Defeat them and you can use the hideout for yourself. The place is mostly empty so if youre looking for a furnished house this isnt it. You get some crafting stations bedrolls a hayloft and safe storage. I didnt see a cookpot or even a firepit.Rowanwood  Falkreath hold near PinewatchDLC  no Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  most vanilla smelter? Clutter  ?  Theres just the one picture of this snowy hilltop home so the interior details arent clear. Looks like you at the very least get most vanilla crafting a bed wardrobe small veggie and flower garden and a goat. Not sure why the author bothered putting a door on a place with  open walls though.Salmon Shack  Near Solitude Sawmill  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Bed   Crafting  cookpotalchemy Clutter  nonstatic  This mod adds a bridge to a small island near the Solitude Sawmill. On the island is a shabby shack with a few holes in the walls and cookfire fish racks and a fishing pier with respawning containers. Inside the shack is a bed alchemy station a chest and some tables and dressers.Saviikkemund  Whiterun Hold W of Fort Greymoor  DLC none Navmesh  yes Beds   Crafting  all vanilla Clutter  nonstatic labeled storage  This mediumsized shack out on the White Plains features a spacious multiroom layout with a bedroom library livingdining area exterior crafting and a stable. The place has a large amount of storage named and otherwise. Note  food containers respawn.Secret Forest Hideout  S of Kynesgrove  DLC  none Navmesh  yes Beds   Crafting  vanilla minus enchanter Clutter  nonstatic  This shack is a bit broken down but still serviceable for someone who doesnt mind grass growing through the floorboards. You get most crafting a bed dresser table a few crafting ingredients and safe storage.Shack at the Whiteriver  Location unknown  DLC  none Navmesh  unlikely Crafting  all vanilla Clutter  ?  Theres only one picture of this place so most of it is a mystery. It looks like this is a shack arrangement designed to offer full crafting with a series of steps and platforms connecting the  buildings. My guess is that you get a bed and safe storage in on tiny shack and the alchemyenchant area in the other.Shack on a lake  Island on Lake Ilinalta  DLC  Hearthfire? Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  cookpotanvilwoodblock Clutter  nonstatic  Places a tiny shack on a tiny island in the lake. Outside is a small pier for fishing a fish rack ore vein picnic table and some storage. Inside is a bed table mead barrel desk cupboard food and more storage containers.Skooma Shack  W of Whiterun  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds  ? Crafting  alchemy Clutter  minimal  Adds a skooma shack on the White Plains. Not enough details and Im not even sure if theres a bed.Skyrim Starter Homes  SW of Dragon Bridge  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  cookpotwoodblocktanning rack Clutter  minimal  The name is a bit of a misnomer as the author only ever got around to creating one shack. The place offers a simple home to a character looking for a nice view and a rural location. Outside is a tanning rack cookpot and woodblock. Inside is a bed table cupboard and safe storage containers. Skyview  S of Morthal  Tested by me  Rated B for Bold Design  DLC  none there is a Climates of Tamrielspecific version however Navmesh  yes Beds  up to  bedbedrolls Crafting  all vanilla  disenchanting Clutter  nonstatic  This story shack has a lot of special features  unpackable bedrolls for  followers toggled fires and candles lockable doors glass windows with curtains that can be openedclosed toggled window shutters table that can be setcleared labeled storage a library with disenchanting option a covered deck and a stable large enough for several horses. The upper level is the living area divided into  rooms by a central fireplace. The lower level is a study and workshop. The forge is located down near the water a short distance from the home. Since this place was designed to make the clear windows the main feature clutter and dcor have been kept minimal.  Impressions  Overall I like the place a lot. The special features are really fantastic but there are some design issues that I think the author dropped the ball on.  No direct interior access between the upper and lower levels is pantsonhead silly.   doors in the upper level is excessive. Removing the ramp and adding stairs to make the deck the main entrance would make more sense.  The tanning rack should be relocated and the deck spruced up a bit.  There really isnt all that much storage upstairs. Still a worthy player home.Small River Side Shack  Eastmarch S of Mixwater Mill  DLC  no Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  all vanilla Clutter  nonstatic  I think this waterfront home is one of the nicer shacks out there. Its built on a deck over the river has a great  waterfall view and offers a lot of features  full vanilla crafting vegetable garden windows that openclose hot springs bathtub and an nicely decorated interior. Find the key located on a burned body nearby and all this can be yours.Starter Shack  Riverwood next to Ralofs stump  DLC  none Navmesh  ?

Theres only one interior picture but aside from the crafting it looks like the place is basic with cots cookfire cupboard various storage containers and probably some sort of dining table.Steamcrag Cottage  S of Windhelm  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  alchemygrindstoneanviltanning rack Clutter  minimal  This tiny hillside shack overlooks Steamcrag Camp and has a deck with a table for watching the steam rise off the hot springs in the morning. I am not certain this has a cookpot.Thannedds Shack  NE of Ivarstead  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds   bedroll Crafting  cookpotalchemyforgewoodblock? Clutter  minimal  The pictures arent the best but this looks more like a sheltered place to sleep and craft rather than an actual home. The place is a series of platforms and open shacks on a rocky outcrop. It offers some crafting and unless theres more Im missing a simple bedroll under a canopy for sleeping.The Aspen Shack  An open world player house  S of Windhelm  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  all vanilla Clutter  none  Places a mediumsized shack on a scaffolding perched with a view over Eastmarch. The interior is very sparse with a sleeping area at one end a central cookfire and a study area at the other end. It feels a lot bigger than it needs to be. There is also a trapdoor into the rock face that opens to a ridiculously large crafting basement.The Forest Shack  Player Home  Near HalfMoon Mill not compatible with Hroldan Nightgate and Sawmill Villages  Tested by me  Rated  C for Creative but Needs Work  DLC  none Navmesh  yes Beds   bedrolls Crafting  vanilla minus tanning rack Clutter  minimal NPC    This pretty lakefront home consists of  ivycovered shacks a deck with a crafting area a vegetable garden pier and boat outdoor cookfire and dining area lots of flowers and a Bosmer followerpotential husband. Conor theoretically lives in the nd shack but in the two games days I had this mod installed he never budged from the enchanting table in the main home.  Impressions  It seemed promising. The shacks are pretty and the location is beautiful. Unfortunately it needs more polish. Aside from the follower not sandboxing I saw floating trees and terrain. There is also no tanning rack which is weird for a Bosmer home. The shacks themselves are cute enough but so bare of furnishings or clutter that its difficult to believe anyone actually lives there. The Salmon Dena immersive Riften playerhome  The Rift lakeside  DLC  none Navmesh  ? Beds   Crafting  most vanilla smelter? Clutter  ?  This places a small room waterfront shack somewhere on a lake in The Rift. Key is located on a nearby island. Outside are  decks over the water one that functions as a crafting area and the other a place to fish or enjoy the afternoon breeze. Behind the home is a flower ingredient garden. The bedroom isnt pictured but the living room has a cookfire table cupboard and potion storage. Looks promising.Tiny Alchemist Hut  N of Riften  DLC  none Navmesh  yes Beds   double Crafting  cookpotalchemygrindstonewoodblocktanning rack Clutter  minimal  A hilltop home with nice views of the Rift this places main feature is the alchemy ingredient container gardens inside and outside.

1909051,0,t3_2ggza7, Empowered Magic A complete overhaul of Skyrims magic system and perk trees which makes spells scale in magnitude with your skill level instead of cost. Empowered Magic modifies various spells which were not very useful in the base game to be more practical makes lowend spells a viable choice in the lategame modifies duplicate spells to have their own unique effects makes Staves practical and more. Empowered Magic  Arcaneum Adds spells to conjure skeletal warriors archers and corrupted shades as well as elemental touch spells. Adds scrolls and staves for the new spells too. Mage Apparel Overhaul  Legendary Edition Integrates robes which Bethesda left out of the base game into Skyrim with both enchanted and unenchanted variants which can be purchased from all merchants that sell clothes modifies several robes and other mage apparel to be more practical and compatible with Mage Armour adds cloth variants of vampire armour gloves and boots and adds enchanted mage apparel to the levelled lists.  Konahriks Accoutrements Adds several sets of robes and armour based off the apparel worn by the dragonpriests and a quest in which you travel back in time to learn how to craft them.  Velvet Robes and Cloaks More robes with matching cloaks. Id recommend pairing this with Enchant Magicka Regen since theyre unenchanted. Immersive College of Winterhold Makes the College of Winterhold much more interesting and extravagent by adding unique clutter books and artifacts to study locations and more.

1917404,0,t3_2gkum9,I recently had a similar problem.The short answer is the problem could be anywhere.I started using several new mods  new to me they are all popular and well known mods  that spawn extra people andor improve distant visuals and a bunch of other stuff and noticed after a while that Frostfall RND and Hunterborn werent working right.  All three mods had played nicely with each other on an earlier playthrough.First thing was to find a save that wasnt bad.  It turned out my mods had been compromised for some time.  I lost nearly all of Level  to find a save where everything was running properly.Then how to stop the problem from happening again?  I had changed my uGrids setting for this playthrough.  Dropping it back solved my problem.Any modschanges that worked before your current playthrough are probably not the problem.  Any change that is new in the current playthrough could be the problem.  The only way to find it is to experiment.  Turn new mods off adjust settings back to earlier levels.  Its a pain to do when youd rather be playing but accept that you gain modding experience in exchange for the lost playtime both spent in troubleshooting and in giving up progress to find a salvageable save. ,skyrimmods,ckk8ft8,1,t5_2sqqh

MO gives you the option of installing profiles that each have their own unique save folder. MO allows you to see much more clearly what files are overwriting each other. MO keeps its own unique Skyrim.ini and Skyrimprefs.ini. Many people say MO is harder to use than NMM but truely I think it is easier I have no clue how to use NMM D. Just keep in mind that on the left side of MO where all your mods are listed handles the load order for texturesmeshesscripts and anything else that would be in a bsa. On the right side of MO you have where the esmesp files are and that handles the load order of those you can use LOOT to organize this side.Once you understand how to view the left side of MO and organize mods there so everything overwrites correctly it is a great piece of software for all your modding needs.

2276486,0,t1_clt2rgh,Well I have little experience with Realvision. Ive installed it and removed it but I dont remember having any trouble. ENBs are usually pretty easy to remove though. Realvision includes some files that go into the Data folder if I remember correctly. Those might be a little trickier to get rid of. Can you reverse engineer your installation? Was there an installer. Im suggesting uninstalling the ENB because you need  a baseline. The ini files may or may not be a red herring. Something else might be wrong and youre probably better off starting where you were preENB than trying to fix what you have now.If you need new inis get rid of the ones youre using rename them something like skyrimprefs.realvision then boot the game from the Steam launcher. It will rebuild your inis for you. Im saying all this totally blind of course because I dont know how youve set up your system. Good luck.

2390649,0,t3_2ms5ry,All of the below are compatible with each other. I use them all. New species spawns patrols Animallica  Adds many new species of wildlife throughout Skyrim. Has a lorefriendly version if you dont like seeing animals that dont make sense in a neararctic biome.  Extended Encounters  Adds a bunch of new random encounters to the wilderness. Well balanced well thought out and makes of a ton of sense. Makes it so you may find some familiar NPCs out in the wild doing their thing instead of always being walled up in some inn.  Immersive Patrols  Adds some more spawns and patrols to the wild. Compatible with the above. I recommend using both. Can add battles of Stormcloaks and Imperials in the wild. Makes Skyrim feel much more alive.  Skyrim Immersive Creatures  Adds new varieties of just about all types of enemies including new varieties of dragons. Also adds spawns to the game world in sensible places. Has a bunch of other miscellaneous features on a pervariety basis. Another one of my favorite mods. Absolutely excellent. AI scaling and combat difficulty Combat Evolved  A great enemy AI overhaul.  Enemy AI OVerhaul  Another greaty enemy AI overhaul. Also overhauls vampire bosses draugr bosses and dragon priest bosses with new AI and abilities to make them smarter and more difficult. Compatible with the above Combat Evolved. I recommend running both.  High Level Enemies  One of my favorite mods. Adds new enemy varieties to level gaps that were previously lacking and allows some or optionally all enemies to automatically scale up in level to match the player. Makes the difficulty curve of the game substantially better. Prevents the game from getting too easy later on. Very worth it. Has an ESP for Falskaar as well!  NPC Smarter Water AI  Tweaks the AI packages so that enemies will swim rather than stopping at the waters edge. Written for maximum compatability. Dragons  Deadly Dragons  Adds more varieties of dragons makes them a bit harder and adds a configuration menu to make them substantially harder still. Also has optional assault system which is a random timed dragon attack configurable for between  and  dragons. Can optionally allow dragon attacks inside cities and has an option to protect NPCs like vendors from death.  Dovahkriid  The Dragon Lords  Adds a few special bosstype dragons to the world. These bosses are tuned to be incredibly difficult.  Dragon Combat Overhaul  A substantial reimagining of the entire dragon system. Completely redoes the entire AI system of dragons substantially expanding their intelligence situational awareness and capabilities. Hands down probably one of my favorite mods. Nobody should play without this. Works well alongside the above mods newly added dragons from most mods should be correctly handled by DCO automatically. Misc Apocalypse  And other spell packages. When combined with ASIS below gives enemy spellcasters access to a wider range of spells making them more difficult and less dull.  ASIS  Gives NPCs friend and enemies of all types access to perks spells and enchantments from the vanilla game as well as any new ones added by mods. Works on new NPCs added by mods. Also increases enemy spawns to make the game more challenging. Hugely configurable.  ASIS Improved INI Files  A set of improved settings for ASIS. Adds support for more mods.  Loot and Degradation  In addition to its other features can optionally give enemies access to tempered and enchanted weapons and armor potentially making them stronger. Also has the sideeffect of making loot more varied you will now find a wider variety of items and armor on enemies including those from other mods you run. Serves as a much simpler version of Lootification which does not need tons of configuration. ,skyrimmods,cm76whv,17,t5_2sqqh

So far I personally prefer iNeed over RND.I quit using Hunterborn a while back since its incompatible with a lot of creatures added by other mods Immersive Creatures and even Boars from the Dragonborn DLC might be different in a later version though. Also it requires a clean save when updating. Which is potentially unsafe for my save game file. It is also very annoying since I lose all my skinning experience progress  not only do i need to disable the Hunterborn plugin but also all my own compatibility patchesSkyproccer Patchesetc which is even more harmful for my save. Finally Hunterborn is very heavily scripted. More than once I got an script lag error when skinningdressing multiple animals.

2513974,0,t1_cmmpj63,There is no such thing as disabling vsync for performance issues in Skyrim. Skyrim is native vsyncmeaning the game is hardcoded to be constantly in vsync mode. I am not sure as I have not tested it but I believe disabling vsync will simple cause more issues than it will fix.You can tell not only because Bethesda has already told us but. There is no windowed mode option usually a good sign. There is no option to enable or disable vsync through the launcher.ENBs however follow a different injector rule and always driver based vsync will be superior to ENB enabled vsync that simply recommends leaving the option for vsync for Skyrim enabled.iMinGrassSize is covered with the exception above.

2570105,0,t1_cmu0cx0,I highly recommend Requiem. Ill never play without it! It makes NPC levels static rather than things leveling with you and other things make sense. Getting hit with one or two arrows can kill you if youre unarmored or in light armor. But itd take more to take down an heavyarmored person. Heavy armor slows you down but you can bull rush people and possible knock them to the ground. Generally things do more damage so combat isnt tedious. Kind of like an FPS where you only take a few bullets before youre down. It can be rewarding if youre good or extremely frustrating if youre not or if you get caught in a bad situation. Youll die a lot. So playing smart and strategic is rewarding.Of course you still level but Ive always felt like Requiem makes it so that leveling doesnt just add bigger numbers to my character but more capabilities. For instance its not just that a higher lockpicking skill will make locks easier. Its that a certain level of lockpicking and the corresponding perk are required before being able to attempt certain locks whatsoever. So the character development is often more qualitative than quantitative which makes it feel like your character is actually growing in power rather than using the same skills from level  to cap and just having bigger numbers come out of the enemies when you hit them. Your old abilities will scale with you and as you level youll be adding new features. Like you can reduce some of the speed penalty from wearing heavy armor which is a huge deal if you have to get close to things to kill them. You can add the ability to do killing blows. Etc. And since NPC levels are static youll start not being able to singlehandedly take out a bandit camp for example but youll grow to that point. Though there are quantitative perks of course like doing more damage with certain types of spells or having their mana costs reduced. But even these have such a dramatic effect that youll feel like your capabilities have changed. Requiems goal is to turn the game into a more traditionaltype RPG and I can see influences from pen and paper Dungeons and Dragons which is as good as it gets. So all in all its difficultfrustratingdiscouraging in the beginning when youre weak but you grow and overcome though there are always uber enemies that will test you. I highly recommend it. For those with my temperament at least.,skyrimmods,cmu1uhp,11,t5_2sqqh

2587331,0,t3_2pf0ch,I have the rudiments of an idea for a true third person camera but Im not great at scripting.Basically a spell summons a tiny creature called DSummon which follows the Player Character and always faces the Player Character. It has an absolutely tiny hitbox or is outright intangible except to stuff like doors obviously. It is immediately turned into the spitting image of the Player Character. The PC then turns invisible. As the PC moves around invisible their DSummon clone will follow them at a very very close range always facing towards them. This will replicate true third person  while the PC will naturally end up facing whichever way the target reticules looking the PC will be invisible so we wont see that. Their DSummon clone will face the PC regardless. Since the player is still the Player Character just invisible theres no question of ability to interact with the world and even combat might work.The player controls everything the PC does movement spells etc and also controls everything DSummon does except movement which is handled by Keep X distance and Y distance and always face the PC scripting on DSummon.

Like Im up against the amount of scripts that Skyrim can handle and all the mods I have i consider essential so if its only a sidegrade of realismimmersion...why bother with sex mods?I have looked for a Cult of Dibella mod but the only one Ive found is incomplete and buggy and does things things I dont like as well making the members of the Temple plastic model types and changing the Heart of Dibella quest entirely into some weird shit.Other than a quality Dibella mod I dont see any reason to use them personally. Though I understand WHY others do...if they want added realism and dont like some of the script heavy SFW ones like Frostfall than all the power to them hell even if they fap Im not concerned with what other guys do with their own penis if it turns them on we...it isnt any different to me than watching someones daughter get paid to take  dicks at once in front of like  crewman eating Pizza and shit.,skyrimmods,cmxeohn,4,t5_2sqqh

I tried using the NMM button in the GUI after running readloadorder.exe from Mod Organizer.So its something about either plugins.txt or modlist.txtNot sure what to look for though. gtIm actually in the process of rewriting how all the files are stored which should take care of any weird symbol issues in any of the files. Im hoping to get the new exe up in the next couple days. In the mean time do you have any backslashes in your plugins or modlist files? Ive seen that causing issues for others. ,skyrimmods,cnrnmpg,1,t5_2sqqh

But you get the general idea.ModlistWeather and lighting  Vanilla interiors nights and dungeons Project Reality  Climates of TamrielI just picked a popular one since I dont have a firm grasp on which weatherlighting mods look neat. They all look neat! I probably went for a more saturated and colorful one. Check the page for all relevant information. As for why the vanilla interiors nights and dungeons  ELFX compatibility though you might want to opt for darker nights if youre not using another mod which alters exterior nights. Enhanced Lights and FXThis mod adds and moves quite a few light sources to more fitting places. More lights cast shadows in interiors. There are alternatives to this like Realistic Lighting Overhaul Relighting Skyrim Series or Shadows but I prefer this package since it handles both interiors and exteriors and is modular. Lights inside taverns and homes is pretty cozy now dungeons are dark and sometimes too hard to navigate. Immersive InteriorsImmersive Interiors plays nicely along with Enhanced Lights and FX even having a compatibility module for the ELFX Enhancer darkened interiors for more contrast in lightcasted shadows. It doesnt affect inside lighting much but generally adds up to the entire interior lighting picture.ENB Series Project ENB Cinematic full without Further dark dungeons for ENBSince Im new to all this I havent tried out many presets. I think I have tried RealVision and this one and stuck to this one because I like the rather saturated view of all of it. The contrasts are good too. I just generally like it.Flora Skyrim Flora OverhaulUsing the regular edition. Nothing strange here. Grass and ground fixesJust touches up some weirdly placed shrubbery. High Definition IvyBecause why not! Natural Grass Texture FloorThis should make the ground look grassyer than before and less painful to look at when there are no D grasses around.Water W.A.T.E.R.  Water And Terrain Enhancement Redux Watercolor for ENB and RWThe first water mod I grabbed though I might switch to Realistic Water Two. SkyFalls and SkyMillsThis animates the waterfalls and mills. Waterfalls dont pop into motion again so this is much less distracting.Meshes and texturesDetail stuff SMIM Project Parallax RemasteredThese make most objects look so much more detailed. With Project Parallax things seem to have more of a texture especially when ENB is enabled. HD MiscBumps up the quality of the pots pans and other stuff you see laying around.  AOF Detailed MountainsBetter mountainrock textures. These grungy looking rocks hide the lowpoly models much better than original textures.

Distant decal fixThings are more detailed at a distance overlay textures dont disappear as soon. Lanterns of SkyrimIf you have a dark night weatherENB Series combination this helps immensely not getting utterly lost and it generally looks nice though it may be a bit loreunfriendly. Cities Civil war repairsI absolutely hated how after the war has been over for a while cities were still in ruins. This should clean things up so towns look nice and tidy again. JKs Skyrim and his other things tooAdds more detail and stuff to towns so they feel less deserted but more cozy.Misc Immersive First Person ViewThough some of you consider this more of a gameplay mod than a visual mod it greatly enhances the immersion experience when youre strolling through the woods or through a city. Also you can see your own legs. YOUR OWN LEGS.Specs Intel Core i K  .GHz GB RAM HD GB Windows on SSD Skyrim on a RPM TB HDD. Load times mainly seem to be influenced by amount of scripts and mods I have running.Im rather new to all this modding Skyrim seriously for less than two months now. My performance is terrible because my graphics card is lowmid ranged and outdated but damn ENB looks so good. Framerate is about FPS with ENB turned on  when its turned off. Generally most mods I mentioned dont have as much of an influence on performance as adding objects to cities. My framerate near Riverwood Falkreath and other outside cities really plummets because of JKs towns and less so in walled cities. Increasing the amount of grass in DocumentsMy GamesSkyrimSkyrim.ini also decreases FPS a lot. Mods which overhaul all the grass by using an ESP and bumping up grass density to ridiculous levels will totally kill your framerate. Using better textures weathers lighting and the like didnt drop my framerate. Skyrim will only cast  simultaneous shadows anyways so dont worry about this one.Graphics card is very much due for an upgrade and Ill probably aim for an R X. VRAM is topping out too according to GPUz but since ENB Series is just heavy on the processing part the processing part fails me in performance. I hope some of this is helpful for you. Ill certainly learn from other posts here but Im pretty happy with my Skyrim as it is. Right now Id just love some better performance.Post layout ripped off from uTaravangian ,skyrimmods,cnu7o77,3,t5_2sqqh

2959206,0,t1_co4ghqa,A merged patch is something you make in tesvedit that looks over your load order and combines different nonconflicting edits to the same thing. Just dont load up skyproc patches into tesvedit for it they dont play well.For example you have a unique weapon in vanilla Skyrim. Volendrung. You have one mod that touches on it with an edit to have it be a bit more lorefriendly making it count as dwarven rather than daedric and raising its price by a lot. Another mod makes the effect more unique it now also has a small chance to paralyze like in previous games. A third mod overhauls damage values in general and thus edits it as well. Normally out of these three only the mod furthest down in your load order would take effect negating all the others.A merged patch helps with that problem by making a patch near the end of your load order that takes layered edits like that and puts them all into said patch. So it would have all those changes for Volendrung but if they also all tried to change one specific value of it like damage then it would choose one of them to put in the game. Still not sure how it chooses its a good idea to look into it to make sure everything is how you want it to be.Theres a lot of videos on it that can explain it better probably a few gopher ones. Im a bit tired right now so this was probably a bit disjointed. A merged patch is generally worth it.

2984845,0,t3_2udbnp,It gives you a bunch of gameplay options and one fantastic feature.You can choose some alternate starting locations with choices to vary up your starting gearspellsetc although imo Alternate Start  Live Another Life does this a better. The big reason to have it is that it lets you disable a some key Skyrim things that are otherwise forced on you word walls shouts and random  scripted wallburial site dragon encounters make sure to also turn DDDCO assaults off.I just installed it myself after realizing that I couldnt play a nondragonborn civil war character without having to be the goddamn dragonborn again. Bottleneck I never expected that one I had assumed the game was more of a sandbox than that discovering that and spending two days looking for a nonexistent workaround was not fun.Basically in practice this mod means you can do a nondragonborn playthrough where you do the Dragons Rising stuff at your leisure its the one scripted dragon fight it wont disable to unlock the civil war and a few other things then immediately erase dragons and shouts from the game and just pretend High Hrothgar prophecies and all that dont exist. Timing is Everything to disable dawnguarddragonborn quests that push you to do the main plot Civil War Overhaul to improve the sidestory etc.Now there is no fated epic quest these Whiterun soldiers are a superstitious bunch with this dragonborn title theyre giving me just because I slew a dragon when they couldnt dragons are a rare almost extinct creature or something or other and that one was just a freak occurence that came in from other lands now back to my nonprophesied life rising through the ranks in the Imperial Legion working to quell this rebellion.,skyrimmods,co7dk7n,1,t5_2sqqh

Some of the dialogue options as well sometimes there isnt just a neutrel option you have to be a smartarse arsekisser or plain old douchebag.

As others said there is an esp limit and there is only so much you can do to push your hardware. There are quirks of the engine like dont try to install all of the heavily scripted mods on the Nexus for example. By and large though there arent really any hard limits. Everyone has their own needs for quality stability and performance. For example I dont mind playing at fps and a crash every  hours. Many on this sub demand fps and many others dont want to crash at all. The one thing you need to keep in mind is that there is no such thing as a perfect game merely a good enough one.

3361278,0,t3_2ymnjk,Ive not used Imps. Basically between iNEED and RND there are two major differences The debuffs you get when you dont eat and the compatability. iNeed has some insane debuffs when you are mildly hungrythirstysleepy including one of them as  damage and  health regen... for being a little bit tired! RND on the other hand nothing at all for being mildly but you better watch out because the  carry weight on being tired is going to force you to drop all of your loot. RND also adds carry weight penalties to diseases which to be honest I think makes the diseases feel far more severe than they are iNeed again diseases will fuck you up in combat but dont have any carry weight penalties. Compatability iNEED figures out how much food restores based on weight. Basically if it is flagged as food and has a weight it will work with iNeed. RND has a special tag that needs to be applied to all food in order to be recognized by the system. The tag is light snack medium meal filling meal and sweet treat. There are also tags that it uses for drinks. This means it needs a patch for anything that touches vanilla food or drinks or that adds more food. iNeed is automatically compatible. RND adds a lot more scripts. It overwrites the scripts for things like Drinking Fountains of Skyrim so need a patch it has its own scripts for milking cows so you cant use Highland Milk Farm it has a lot of other scripts. This also means it has compatability issues. What it does it does well and efficiently. Im no scripter but from what I can see in game it works very well. On the other hand if youre worried about conflicting scripts or too many scripts iNeed will have less of an issue still some its impossible to do what these mods do without scripts!. iNeed lets you drink from wells and waterfalls. RND lets you drink from any open water. Thats pretty much it. ,skyrimmods,cpbeslj,2,t5_2sqqh

3380531,0,t1_cpcz6yy,Yeah definitely needs to be a quest given early game but Im thinking if we have multiple weapons we can just make it a quest to get the player the blood ironsoul extractor the storage vial and maybe a azure soul gem to capture their soul essence check out uShanix reply to the parent post and then tell them they can use said items to get ingredients to take to daedric lord shrines so that the lord will craft them a weapon and based on which lord you go to will give you a different weapon. Also playing with an idea that different races give different blood minerals and that since some are rarer than others that it gives the weapon a better enchantment based on trapped soul essence. Complete choice in a blood weapon to fit any playstyle is what I think the scope of this quest should be. Plus it only seems right to make it daedric meh maybe vampirewerewolf related because blood and soul trap and it wouldnt feel immersion breaking for anyone that cares.,skyrimmods,cpdlt5e,3,t5_2sqqh
3380931,0,t1_cpdl40b,The problem with orcs being rarer and giving more powerful enchants is that the player will feel obliged to only hunt for orcs.

Possibly reduce the yield per recipe to ONE arrow. If this is literally going to wreck dragons midflight and just ignore armor completely it better be expensive.

3774252,0,t3_33mtcc,Well what you need is matched sets of textures AND normalmaps.IF this is happening on your males Id advise you use either Skysight or Better Males for the guys and make sure that your female textures are matched too SG or Mature or Realgirls or Bellas but NOT mixes of those. But only one of them! one male replacer one female. Also in mod organizer make sure nothing is overwriting the normalmaps or textures  like a scar mod or brow or lip mod further down the line. If they come with their own face normalmap it can screw you.Explanation of the neckseam bug In order to make skyrim characters look more real there are two types of textures used well more than that but to simplify think .One is the texture  which light in the game hits off and reflects back and the second is the normalmap. Normalmap is a bit more complex an easy way to think of it is that it sits behind the regular texture and dictates how light reflects off the regular texture.Therefore if you have two types of normal maps say one for the head and one for the body that dont match light reflects different off the textures on the top than on the bottom .So  you need to have whoever creates the textures make matching sets of normal maps too.Some NPC mods only come with a replacement normalmap face or body and that screws you too. so you have to make sure your NPC addons and overhauls come before your UNP and skeleton and texture mods texture mods like SG for instance come dead last so that they overwrite any bad replacements. Thus if you get a neckseam youve either gotUnmatched normal mapsUnmatched TexturesUnmatched Nifs skeleton meshMOSTLY its the normalmaps for the color difference bugs in skyrim.,skyrimmods,cqmhqpa,2,t5_2sqqh

3788776,0,t1_cqo4wv1,gt No mod can be properly tested in a mod list in  hours.This is likely true for many mods whether its just due to the fact that few have that much free time to test it. In this thread however the outrage is coming from users upset that this particular developer decided to add a minimum monetization option at all which is strange.I know many have paid more than a  for Steam cards alone most I know on Steam have. For the support and love this mod receives Im just surprised the reaction is so negative for what accounts for many worthwhile hours of work.gt I also wont buy the mod on the Workshop since I dont use the workshop for Skyrim as its incompatible with Mod Organizer.This is the unfortunate aspect of this.gt I also fear what this paid mod system could do to other games. The possibilities for damage are endless for this.Only time will tell how this will pan out. There may be a flood of crappy mods that are monetized likely but it may actually be positive to the community and help worthwhile modmakers who have been creating things for the love of it see some healthy support such as SkyUI. The latter I see as a positive thing.,skyrimmods,cqo5fim,3,t5_2sqqh

3806733,0,t3_340h97,Generally speaking I wont be buying any mods off the SW as long as the authors cut is only . Id resent even a tenth of what I spend going to people who are exploiting my favorite online community. Im not entirely opposed to the concept of monetizing mods in general.Your examples in order and assuming the authors got a fair cut Up to the author but any remaining imperfections in the mod when you go Paid will cost your salesreputation greatly. Nothing wrong in principle but in SkyUIs case you occupy a very important role in the community and if youre trying to extort sales from users who have come to depend on you youre being an asshole and deserve to be replaced and ostracized. Profit off SW noobsidiots I dont really mind lol. Someday the SW will likely be on consoles and well all get to laugh at peasants even more. Acceptable as long as your updates dont exploit the community because of mod interdepencies in which case youre being a dick and might get replaced and ostracized. Probably unwise because of the first wave of customer feedback. If its free people will tell you about bugs they find in order to help.

But this whole fiasco has brought out a new level of selfentitlement that far eclipses anything Ive seen before in the community.

3816344,0,t1_cqr7zbf,Money made by sites and youtubers is a bit different. Theyre not receiving money from the players but by advertisers. This has become the norm for the internet as users couldnt afford to pay for every website they visit any more than they could for the hundreds of Skyrim mods they try. Nexus and some other sites do have the exception of paid premium accounts which is entirely optional. What these have in common is that all of them present the content for free. This allows more people to experience it and allows for the most growth in popularity. While arguments are valid that some are and some are not receiving income its undeniable that being available for everyone has been the goal for all programs involved. Youtubers like totalbiscuit have been against the majority opinion of compensation for modders because they do recognize the hipocrisy of demanding free mods while also getting paid for their own creations.I dont think ad revenue would work very well for modding because players dont want yet another entertainment form filled with intrusive ads. That leaves traditional payment methods or donations. As Bethesda owns the rights to any monetization modders cant choose their own way of doing a paid system. Since they hold all the cards and the only portal for revenue their system was bound to see backlash. It might be somehow possible that sites like Nexus could compensate modders based on some merit in the future since they do receive income for the contributions those modders have madeas it is now I think Darkne is being truthful that the income isnt significantly more than the costs of business so the sums would be tiny. Right now a solution like that would be problematic due to Bethesdas right to deny modders ability to profit from their IPdonations are a loophole of sorts they arent purchases or tied to any mod in particular.In the future things may turn out differently but for now the only logical solution is by donationincluding perhaps patreon etc. depending on legality. What we can be doing is promoting donations for modders that people feel deserve the compensation. Regardless of results in the past I see no reason why this cant work if people try to make it work. Darkne is taking steps for this on the Nexus and any other ideas to promote the donation model should be welcomed.,skyrimmods,cqral5c,7,t5_2sqqh

3931331,0,t3_35h2r5,gt My Redditsearchfu is not excellent so I probably missed lots of relevant threads.    use google with something like mods long game past level site wwwreddit.comrskyrimmods to search rskyrimmods with google searching via reddit sucks and this site by nature is an absolute horror to find anything so i dont blame you for not being able to bring anything up.    To answer your question...    you cant win here unfortunately.  One option could be requiem where you level slower and dragons are something you want to avoid until at least level  as the game is now completely unleveled you will however become a god around  and asside from vampire lairs daedra and some unique NPCs nothing will stand in your way.   The flip side is using other combat enhancers and a perk rebalance such as PerMa you start off squishy but at level  you then run into the issue of fighting dragur uber death hyperoverlords which are only harder because they do insane amounts of damage and have insaner amounts of health.    see my point here? you either become a god or have the game to resort to bulshit methods to keep things hard due to the nature of the game the best you can do is prolong becoming a god.    options to slow things down are     Morrowloot to better distribute high tier items no more elvendwemer  items in the loot pool   Scarcity to lower the amount of item loot globally  gold adjustment like scarcity but for gold itselfgold in chests those little gold sacks etc.   anything to slow your leveling down    What this does is increase the time taken to build up your character so when you do reach god status youve done far more.       ,skyrimmods,cr4eo24,2,t5_2sqqh

Fortunately you can either confirm or deny your suspicions pretty easily by looking at the mod page authors normally post if their mod is compatible or incompatible with other mods.

4121938,0,t1_crq4er8,As I explaned it to another user on this post Ill just plagiarize that gtDepends on the mods and how many graphical mods youre using K K K textures ect. Youre probably fine with what you have now. That being said I run  mods all K textures and have a gb card and set mine at . which is overkill.I suggest using Skyrim Performance Monitor to see how much RAM is being used vs. VRAM being used. If like mb of RAM is being used for gb card then you dont need to set it at mb because theres gb of space that you said it could use that its not usingand could lower it to mb. Would it help anything? Hard to say it might use the memory more efficiency. So try and find out if it makes any difference.TLDR Use Skyrim performance monitor and see how much actual RAM Skyrim is using if nots not anywhere near  then youre fine. But you can increase it if needed. Is it dangerous to run ? No but its probably inefficient. ,skyrimmods,crq4jl9,2,t5_2sqqh

4149483,0,t3_384416,All great ideas and most are probably somewhat doable. Id definitely recommend trying out some tutorials quest design and crime faction at least as it will at least familiarize you with some of the Creation Kit quirks youre going to have to work around. Simply put if you want to do something specific youre not going to find a guide on how to do it  youre going to have to figure out the tools first and then work out how you might apply them. Fortunately Creation Kit is pretty easy to pick up even if its interface and data storage methods can be somewhat overwhelming at first.gtSubdue ability which allows you to incapacitate an enemy without killing himher during combat so you can be a thug without being a murderer.I too have always wanted more nonlethal options  the only real alternative to killing is Paralysis which isnt available until too high a level to really be viable. Ash Shell is kind of an improvement but is arguably overpowered. Since Skyrim doesnt allow you to interact with incombat enemies I dont know if an ability would really work. Maybe you can have a special weapon type or tweaked unarmed attacks which apply a longterm paralysis effect with ragdoll possibly if an actor is unaware or below a certain amount of health.gtHolds now share bounties based upon their relationships with one another i.e. Whiterun will count  of the bounty you accumulate in Eastmarch toward your bounty in in Whiterun as part of an agreement to track criminals.This might be tricky but would certainly add more realism to being a wanted thief. I havent played around with crime factions much so I dont know how hard it might be to pass info between them  but can hazard a few guesses. A script which adds to the bounty of a list of crime factions shouldnt be too difficult  but be aware that some of the data methods used in Skyrim are more convoluted than they might seem at first glance. Worst case scenario  youd have to create multiple new crime factions inside of a hold for each neighbor which might be more trouble than its worth. At any rate probably best to stick with the major holds at least until you know its working properly.gt Completing builtin quests for the various holds will yield influence points within those holds which you can expend to alter penalties for crimes relationships between holds and other things.The trickiest idea as youd have to not only create a new point system but also make it interact with some methods that are already in place. I imagine this was something Bethesda wanted to include but had to break it down into the simpler more workable Thane system. I wouldnt try something like this without significant game coding experience and an intimate knowledge of how Skyrim stores crime data.At any rate good ideas and best luck. The Bethesda design approach is ripe for nonlethal and morally openended gameplay. I hope they explore this more in future games but in the meantime its nice to see mods which try out some different approaches.,skyrimmods,crt97mz,2,t5_2sqqh

The motherboard is a bit overkill but it was much cheaper than equivalent enthusiastgrade motherboards for the same performance and durability reviews and I wanted a MoBo I wouldnt ever have to worry about. I think there is very good reason games might start using more than  GB of RAM on maximum settings in the next few years. Honestly Ill be sad if they dont. Give me more things! Youre probably right on the hyperthreading. One of the reasons I chose this is I got a supremely good deal on the CPU and I tend to run everything under the sun five excel spreadsheets firefox with  tabs hexchat adobe reader word etc. etc. etc. while Im gaming and the CPU and extra RAM give me the overhead that I can do that without my computer even breaking a sweat er... turning up CPU fan speed?  . ,skyrimmods,cteshpx,1,t5_2sqqh

4730186,0,t1_ctqdjjr,I included Unlimited Bookshelves on my Masterlist of dangerous mods under the warnings category with a rating of seven gtSeven   Mostly Stable but sometimes presents with severe bugsplease note any percentages given below are only a rough estimate based on my own experience with the mod and troubleshooting people who have the mod installed not hard figures and should not be taken as suchBased on the approximate usage of the mod based on load orders I have seen while troubleshooting or just looking around modwatch and reports of bugs from people having had issues or warning others away I APPROXIMATE that the mod has about a  probability of presenting with bugs in any given game.The most common bug that might occur is that ingots dont stack and honestly I have no bloody idea in the world why. I have looked through the scripts looked at the data and even looked at editing the ingots records to see if I could force the bug and no luck. I cant find a technical reason why it happens it just happens. That bug probably accounts for  of all bug reports on the mod. Probably  of the rest of the bug reports are major such as houses no longer loading or even CTDing if you enter it and you have used the mod on that house. The other  of bugs that get reported are actually object bounds bugs mod added items that dont have object bounds set properly so they clip into each othe or at odd angles a particular issue with scrolls which always get rotated around oddly if added from mods or cause visual glitching such as books looking messy or falling out of the bookshelf and end up suspended in mid air.I personally rule the mod safe to use and have used it for the last  hours without problem but it always is that risk that it might go wrong hence the number seven rating.,skyrimmods,ctqs59j,2,t5_2sqqh

4816284,0,t3_3gtpiq,The whole Magical Anchor Anchorite mechanic from the alteration tree needs a change I feel. Right now I really dont see any use for it other than for a slightly convenient fast travel back to lets say your house. If the anchors bonuses could be severely weakened while the anchor became a once a day power and the anchor itself were transient that would make it a lot more usable. If you absolutely want to stick with the one master anchor idea perhaps have a later perk unlock a once a day power for transient mini beacons. Alternatively allow dimension door to be a two way teleport that disappears upon use. This will allow the anchor to be used as a powerful once a day buff before a particularly tough battle. But a limit of one permanent anchor for the whole world doesnt feel very interesting. If there were different types of anchors with different effects working more like druidic totems than as permanent fixtures that will make a great game play mechanic in and of itself. But right now this whole mechanic feels very underwhelming. Another thing that I am not comfortable with is the at the moment you learn this perk style of perks. This relates to the idea of trying to get the best out of that perk. For perks like Arcane Thesis or Miracle there is always a lingering doubt if you are really getting the best out of this by using it right now. What if there is a weapon or spell or enchantment that I have not yet discovered? Would that new one be more ideal for this perk than the ones I have right now? I better hold off.And like this the perk keeps getting pushed off. I am not sure how one would solve this situation though. Overall looking forward to .!,skyrimmods,cu1mrd4,2,t5_2sqqh

I think youll encounter a significant performance drop especially in the Riverrun area.Fourth if youre thinking of populating all these houses with NPCs from various mods I suspect that youre going to be in for a bad time.

You get into this pattern of trying to figure out how you got into this miserable hole and you spend all day rationalizing while staring at the ceiling and thats how you perpetuate depression forever.You just cant rationalize your way out of it even though trying is incredibly tempting. Its an emotional problem not a rational one. Its fixed with emotional leverage not introspection. Go outside yourself not inside yourself.Accept that youll need help and then be open to help from others. Friends family or even strangers.

As far as I or this community am aware all other wildlife mods SHOULD be safe to use.

Be warned though it works on both you and NPCs so getting surrounded is a very very bad idea youll be unable to move and a swift death is often in order.

5101507,0,t3_3ks4an,Fourlegged DampDstyle dragons. Ive always thought Skyrim dragons looked really awkward without forelegs. IMO dragons look much more majestic and powerful when they have front legs. It would make them seem more like intelligent creatures since theyd have hands they could use to build stuff like the word walls use tools and create art and culture. It would also give them more melee options.A way for modders to make more cinematic dialoguecutscenes like The Witcher or Bioware games. Id at least like a way to hold a conversation with more than one NPC at once without awkwardly switching in and out of dialogue mode. Currently the only way to do something like this would be for the player to be in dialogue mode say something to one NPC have the game exit dialogue so another NPC can chime in forcegreet to reenter dialogue mode so player can say something repeat. I can just imagine the headaches Id get from having my screen whip around so much which is probably the reason I havent seen any mods try to do this.A hotkey that works as a skip through the cutscene button. When you press it NPCs skip to their next line of dialogue or the next action theyre scripted to perform. I know you can sprint into someone to make them skip to their next line but it only works for NPCs who are standing and not interacting with crafting stations sitting down etc. and its just awkward to use.More total conversions. Whether its an original setting like Enderal or an existing setting like DampD Id like to see Skyrim used as a platform for creating stories outside the Elder Scrolls universe. I dont even care if theyre not full open worlds. Id be fine with a bunch of mostlylinear selfcontained adventures like Neverwinter Nights modules are.

SkyRE dont get my wrong is a great mod but is really a pain to set up correctly because has so many incompatibilities with other mods and you need to heavily rely on the ReProccer and patches. IMHO it just touches to many things... if you want to aim to the most compatible mods this inst one of them.,skyrimmods,cvef4a6,1,t5_2sqqh
5214475,0,t1_cvej0ga,Ordinator is lightweight and only deals with two things perks and stealth. Thats it. You can pop it in anywhere and have minimal compatibility issues.PerMa is much more complicated. It uses a lot of scripts needs to be built around rather than plugandplay and has a patcher. However it overhauls most gameplay aspects not as much as Requiem for the better and has a lot more variety in perks and such. If you install it right it is relatively stable and doesnt many issues. However if you dont youll end up having quite a few. Dont let that turn you off though it is very easy to install correctly. Just depends on what you want. PerMa eliminates the need for a lot of things but also has more incompatibilities. Ordinator is compatible with . of mods and is lightweight.

5248207,0,t1_cvil0fg,Editing GetFormFromFile calls is ridiculously easy but very timeconsuming.Feed the scripts into Champollion. Launch two copies of TesEdit. Load your merged plugin in one and your merge order in the other. When you come across a GetFormFromFile call look up the referenced FormID in the Vanilla TesEdit then look up the same record in your merged plugin and check if the FormID has changed. If it has change the FormID in the script to match. Gets very timeconsuming once you have to edit  entries and checking all your mod scripts for GetFormFromFile is annoying even with Champollion and batch files. But for something like Immersive Horses reference to Craftable Horse Barding which obviously no other mod is going to use or that get form from self in Mintylightningmod it can be very useful.You can also cheat for any one ESP in each merge by making it the first mod in your merge order and renaming the merged ESP to be the same as the first ESP. Thats kind of hacky but it works for any one mod.But I can absolutely see how this would become a nightmare so youre totally right. Its absolutely better to find something else to do. This is really a niche trick to get those last two ESPs in.Edit  Im probably not making it clear enough that youre right! Its much much easier to not do the above.,skyrimmods,cvilj4c,3,t5_2sqqh

So Ive loaded up JKs Skyrim Enhanced Landscapes with the Dark Fantasy esp Great Forest of Whiterun and Legendary Cities and I am loving the general results but Im encountering issues.

Im not sure this is an issue that can be fixed my machine is pretty beefy but the mod combo adds a lot of objects.    The real issue is a weird conflict between Enhanced Landscape Dark Fantasy and Great Forest. Most of the trees are dead looking no leaves but about a third of them have a very leafy lowres lod that intersects this lod is there no matter the distance between myself and the tree. Ill post a picture as soon as I get home from work but when I open up the console the tree is generated by Great Forest but the lowres lod is generated by Enhanced Landscaped Dark Fantasy.

For example several sexy mods were mentioned on the forum posts that dont work cause they are overhauls of certain assets so you need disableblack list them before running the patcher as they will crash it.As for the other mods. It depends on what other mods youre using as well. IIRC ACE is pretty simple so you dont need any patches if youre using CCO or WARF while Ordinator is kinda more complex so you will need to download the Patches to player nice.

Spend a weekend following that and it will teach you a large portion of what to do and give you a very stable base to add on to.After that look up some videos on tesedit or just mess around with it like I did. A good tip is to apply filter for conflict losers to help you figure out what esps are being overwritten by others to establish your load order.As a side note not as many mods really conflict with each other as you may think.

MO doesnt actually touch the Skyrim data folder and I can easily see what is overwriting what almost at any time. I can easily reorganize overwriting texturesmesheswhatever to get the desired effect in my game without uninstallingreinstalling and keeping track of when I installed a texturemeshwhatever. NMM apparently keeps a short history of what was overwritten and can restore the previously overwritten texture? Someone on here mentioned they were in too deep with that to bother switching to MO. It feels much more... intuitive? than NMM ever was for me. But if you like NMM and it works well for you and you have a stable game using it I say more power to you!,skyrimmods,cwrwy62,1,t5_2sqqh

Im basically using every texture I want since GB is plenty enough. Im even thinking about moving to P.If you want better cooling for your CPU you can get H but honestly H is good enough to give you some overclocking room and it will keep your CPU still in respectable temps. I believe you can easily get .GHz with this setup. Pretty good PSU decent AIO Cooler and good motherboard with nice power delivery.I actually use two SSDs. One for Windows and softwares and the other one is dedicated to only games including Skyrim. Everything else just sits in the HDD. If you want an additional SSD too just get another  EVO they are pretty cheap at the moment.Noctis  is my personal choice I just like that case.I honestly wouldnt get a PC based on K there is literally no performance difference in games. Same as DDR. There is like  performance improvement at best and that is only true in benchmarks. Im yet to see an actual ingame difference. If you still wanna get it just for the sake of getting the newest one then I guess its your choice.ampnbspampnbspType|Item|Price||CPU | Intel Core iK .GHz QuadCore Processor | .

5645219,0,t3_3sftv1,Expanded Towns and Cities does not conflict with Legendary Cities  Tes Arena  Skyrim Frontier Fortress. ETaC has a very detailed compatibility list you can see hereAs far as general rules pretty much whenever two mods modify the same thing there is a chance of conflict . Normally mod authors are decent enough to post what conflicts and what doesnt on the mod page and all you have to do is read. There is an exception to this rule generally mods that add new items weapons armors potions ect wont conflict with each other. This isnt always the case but generally speaking its okay. Furthermore to make things even more complicated any new leveled items that get to the game must be added the leveled list for them to show up correctly. other wise you might add a mod that has a level  set of armor and it will show up at vendors during level . Normally this is done with a Bashed Patch which is super easy to make and takes all of  minutes. ,skyrimmods,cwwue23,3,t5_2sqqh

Like I said I actually think this mod is pretty cool as an experiment or a modding exercise I just dont think it adds value to gameplay for the reasons I stated.gt Ideally youd recreate puzzles that actually take more thought and intelligence to solve the puzzle.Ideally yeah that would be great. However I think the puzzles could be improved in ways that arent even so grandiose. What I mean is the puzzles in Skyrim just have you do the exact same thing every single time turn the pillars into the correct position.

5844595,0,t1_cxlnt0q,Well that was on an Acer XBHU bprz  inch which has a native resolution of x so it looked normal p spread across  inches looks pixelated and blurry unless youre far away on a sofa. Ive some lowspec test machines that can run Skyrim in x at  FPS depending on their GPU when the textures and meshes are chosen carefully and ENB is in Boost mode i.e. UsePatchSpeedhackWithoutGraphicstrue. Even  FPS can give a good experience as long as its not tearing or showing input latency the latter can make  FPS feel worse that .I dont recall if Skyrims configuration UI lists x as a resolution as I never run it too dangerous as it overwrites all our hard work tuning the INI files.

On the one hand if you only want gameplayenhancing mods you can get any basic gamingdedicated PC and have a blast with very high FPS. Many people with GB of VRAM can play Skyrim smoothly.On the other hand if you want to improve how Skyrim looks GPU will become an important consideration. What really eat the VRAM are the graphics amp texture mods as well as the ENBs. For the game to look better than TW theres actually no limit to how good your rig needs to be. Personally my GTXTi is struggling to go above FPS and Im at . GB of VRAM usage.

Then I found CESAand it messed up my attack speed when I picked the dual wield attack speed perk from ordinator. So I had to uninstall CESA.Loaded a Save from a few hours earlier and all is fine.A few days later I found Familiar Faces and Weapons and Armor AttributesSomehow one of these two messed up with the game in the same way attack speed bug and even though I uninstalled them with their respective guides no matter how earlier I went with loading my saves it would always have messed up attack speed again.So now Im on a clean install of everything and following the S.T.E.P guide and Ill see from there....EDIT I tried many methods before uninstalling completely. Someone provided an Attack Speed Fix but then I only came to realize that my followers had Slowmotion attack speed. I tried opening up the console and setting the weaponspeedmult my self for my  followers also using AFT  but then I noticed the rest of the npcs  enemies etc. had all the same problem.

5959152,0,t3_3wyyp2,It depends on the ENB youre using or more specifically the enbeffectprepass.fx file that youre using. Some of them are set up so that you can adjust the location on the screen that is used for automatic focus often with the option to manually set the distance yourself rather than letting the ENB do it probably easier to do panoramic shots this way.To adjust this if your ENB allows it open the ingame ENB UI default is ShiftEnter I think. In the Shader parameters window expand ENBEFFECTPREPASS.FX by clicking on it its useful to open the console when doing this so you dont move around or attack things though keep in mind that the ENB uses its own cursor which does not match up with the Skyrim cursor. If you have options there that say something to the effect of Autofocus Position you can adjust the X and Y coordinates it uses for focusing  I think normally  is the upper left corner of the screen and  is lower right. Some even have a feature that allows you to toggle a small mark on the screen so that you can see exactly where that focus is. You might also see something like Manual Focus Mode which you can enable and then set your own focal distance by adjusting a different variable probably named something related to manual focal distance. For example This is what mine looks like. The enbeffectprepass.fx Im using is available HereIf you do not have these options there then it would seem that your file is not set up with those features. While you would not be able to adjust those settings from ingame if thats the case you could still alttab out edit the file save and alttab back in though that would be tedious. You could also edit the file to add those features. Ive added the focal point adjustment to a couple of files Ive used in the past its only a couple of lines of code though exactly what those lines are depends on the variables being used. As for the other features I mentioned above Ive never tried adding those myself so I dont exactly know what would be involved in that.,skyrimmods,cy0rxl9,1,t5_2sqqh

The ini has the old directory info in it and since you moved it MO doesnt know where to look to find your mods. It should automatically create a new ini with the updated info the next time you open it.Moving MO back to where you moved it from should also achieve the same thing if you just want to avoid deleting the ini.

6314511,0,t1_cz7d0rx,gtP.S. Im curious how many of those  records your previous bashed patch had were identical to previous override. None. Fact. This is the kind of BS Im frankly tired of seeing people say when theyre selfadmitting to never using it to start with.gtIt. is. not. a matter of opinion that literally everything Wrye Bash can do can be done with equivalent ease by other tools.Yes it is because its not factually accurate that this statement is true. I see the results EVERY DAY of people assuming this to be true and fucking up their games assuming these other more complex tools that do things  of people DONT NEED DONE. This very sub is FILLED with post after post after post on the subject but they all think MO and other stuff like it is all their is because its all anyone bothers to mention anymore.I grant that Skyrim has many many more people modding the game now than Oblivion did back then but it didnt take thread after thread after thread of seeing this over and over again to explain it to people. And we basically all used Bash in pretty much the same way its being used now. There are even guides for beginners that are very well done on the subject. I literally dont need to do that myself because those resources are out there already.I can tell you with  certainty that I could write the worlds best guide on how to mod Skyrim using nothing but Wrye Bash and a little patience to learn and all Id get for my efforts is to be told Im living in the past and that MO or Smash or SkyProc or some other tweak system is vastly superior and I need to stop resisting the change. I can tell you this because I have already tried it and was soundly rejected for it.So if I seem defensive to you I may well be because Im sick of being told that what I know works is stupid and lame and that I should move on cause this new flashy thing thats been written is better and oh yeah now I need  tools to do the same work one could before and it should all be linked to MO because reasons. Just no. Id rather go back to manually installing my mods if Bash were to vanish from the planet for some reason.At this point I really couldnt care less. I know what works. I know you know I know. I know people who listen to what I have to say when they ask usually come away better for it with a better understanding of why theyve been doing things in a more complicated way than was necessary to accomplish the task.

6379289,0,t3_431d7b,I actually prefer how Skyrim does this in a more seamless way. The people around you already respond to you stealing their shit or doing you favours and Ive never liked the artificiality of imposed karma systems in most video games.However I think a mod to enhance preexisting relationship systems in the game and give your actions more weight and consequence would be great. NPCs respond to you positively when youre near if youre considered a friend they should also respond to you negatively if theyve ever witnessed you commit a crime in front of them especially if youve ever stolen something that belongs to them rather than just pretending like it never happened once youve paid off your bounty. Dialogue options that will influence how NPCs respond to you in the future customized to individual NPC personalities wouldnt it be cool if some NPCs became standoffish after youve been snarky with them while some NPCs actually liked you for it? Also chances to receive random gifts from people youve befriended or done favours for would also be very cool.Basically I like how Skyrim encourages the player to roleplay rather than imposing some artificial karma system but I think you have the right idea in that the existing systems can be made to be more realistic and better integrated into the rest of the gameplay.Edit Clearer word choice,skyrimmods,czer8yo,13,t5_2sqqh

Then they could run a full subscription for month that gives players access to all premium mods across all games on Nexus and the proceeds are divided amongst mod authors  Nexus admins.

Those are my top .Interesting NPCs have at least a couple good ones including a certain tundra cotton farmer I like as my follower.I sort of liked Mrissi...until the quest was pretty broken and not all that great. Vilja...I know everyone thinks shes great and I admit the work put into her is impressive. However...that voice. Couldnt stand it. Hoth  Pretty neat with the radiant quests.Aurlyn Dawnstone  Pretty interesting and not one of your pretty follower types too. Worth a try and I think well done. Would make my top Cerwiden  A healer is good...the quest was broken for me but useful in combat for sure. Viconia  Ok its old and not the best but if you liked Balders Gate...well I have a soft spot for this one.

6579982,0,t3_45rpuv,Did you look at the Outdated And Dangerous Modlist Its been updated for some time now. Quite stable considering how large of a mod it is. Ignore bug reports from before  th January CWO is a mod with a big reputation for being unstable and problematic. It attempts to restore all of the cut Civil War content that Bethesda abandoned but it had a lot of hurdles to jump and the existing very buggy Civil War to overwrite. Apollodown acknowledges in his description that the early versions of the mod were very buggy and problematic and why that was the case. While most major bugs were ironed out with v its v that has caused this mod to now be included here.Version  of CWO includes an in built bug detection system that attempts to automatically accommodate for script issues engine problems and other conflicts and adapt the mod around this. Not only have almost all bugs now been ironed out of the mod any bugs that might be caused by script latency etc will usually get picked up by the bug prevention system which will stop quests and other features of the mod from running if it detects that a problem will occur. In fact it will detect these potential problems accurately enough to stop quests from running dozens of times in a row until it knows that it can run properly and then let the game go ahead. On top of this any bugs that you run into can now be bypassed with the new MCM features  which allow you attempt to troubleshoot any remaining issues without relying on unreliable tools such as the console.This is not to say the mod is bug free. It is an expansive and detailed mod that contains a lot of features and edits and it does still have the occasional problem or bizarre bug appear as does any mod that is this big but it is no longer dangerous to save files on mass.,skyrimmods,czzx9p0,3,t5_2sqqh

Your new to requiem arent you? theres a few things that say to me that youve never played the mod...on rskyrimrequiem right now the weekly thread is reguarding survival mods. I would recomend Hunterborn for the reasons ive detailed there it adds so much to do as a hunter. Bathing in skyrim too so you look like youve been out in the wilderness. the post also has some discussion about disease you should absolutely read. Be sure to check out the companion mods for requiem in the sidebar too. Feel free to ask any other questions in the thread or subreddit.RoTE  is incompatible the older version has a patch but it does not play well with requiem add it later on but the game will be hard enough without it. It also does a lot of imbalanced bullshit thats barely OK in vanilla but hell in requiem. Same goes for deadly dragons add it later if you like but it will be overkill if your not ready for it.

Yes I will admit its a weird legal scenario where writing a patching tool would be perfectly fine but the resulting output legally unusable because it then needs to modify the original content.Running two independent mods together in memory is not at all the same thing since neither author has done anything to modify the works of other authors. They are modifying game content according to whats already legally permitted.We arent really talking about automated patchers here though.

Im not a noob to the CK new with scripts though but Im having issues getting scripts to appear. Im running the CK through MO like you recommend.  The only way I can get scripts to appear so I can add them to an object is to find one of your objects that already has that script click on it then properties then just cancelling out of everything. After that Im magically allowed to add that script to other items but only that one script I went through this process with.

6836689,0,t3_49841r,A few favorites that havent been mentioned yet Morrowloot Ultimate just everything about this mod justifies itself  rare is truly rare unique is unique knowledge is not universal etc. The world behaves a lot more like the lore tells us its supposed to. Brigandage adds diversity to brigand outifts so bandit groups look more scrappy their armors put together from whatever they can loot. Female Pants just you know. Some women wear dresses some women wear pants. Small things that make the world feel more varied and real.  Practical Female Armors your mileage may vary but boob plate is a huge immersion killer for me. Just gives me that videogamey vibe that takes me right out of the moment. Height Adjusted Races with True Giants more small things that make a big difference. Different races have different heights makes those what do you want little elf? lines sound better when you are a very tiny elf makes those lines about you NordsHigh Elves being so tall make more sense when you are a head taller than everyone else.  Living Takes Time smithing takes time reading takes time selling your crap to the local smuggler kitten takes time etc. Using this with Frostfall  Campfire  your favorite needs mod you find your days running out faster and your adventures taking longer  where you could cross all of Skyrim and back in two days now it may take you two months to reach that remote cave and kill that troll and find that bow and bring it back to that one guy halfway across the countryside because time passes when youre doing stuff.  Sometimes Pick Up Books because youre not gonna sit down for two hours with Living Takes Time! in the middle of a draugrinfested dungeon to read a moldy copy of A Brief History of the Empire when you have things to do and places to go. Throw the book in your backpack read it later that night when youre camping and wanna kill some time before you sleep. Lock Overhaul lockpicking is great for sneak thieves with butter fingers but mages should be able to melt locks down with their phenomenal cosmic powers and warriors with little patience for finicky locks should be able to just kick any chest open and call it a day. Hidden Hideouts of Skyrim this is a flavour mod but with Skyrim having so many brigands hunters poachers etc it makes sense that there would be more hideouts out in the wilds more abandoned camps in old caves more forgotten places where someone spent a night once things like that. Shortcuts  Secret Entrances For All Cities Plus Thieves Guild another flavour mod more geared towards thieves but it makes sense that the Guild would have built these secret passages over time. More sense than walking right through the front gates and waving the guards hello on your way to sweep the entire city of its valuables at least. Winterhold  Expanded Ruins  Winterhold Rebuild everyone keeps going on about how Winterhold was so great once and its in such ruins now yet there are no ruins other than like... two run down farmhouses. With the first mod you can actually see the ruins and feel a better sense of tragedy surrounding the place and with the second you can actually do something about it helping the people rebuild a little bit.Two that have been mentioned but Imma recommend again Oblivion Gates makes the world feel more like a real part of Tamriel if you played Oblivion. The broken gates found in the oddest and most remote places remind you of the Oblivion crisis makes Skyrim feel like it was part of that moment too.  Touring Carriages most immersive way to fast travel without actually fasttravelling. You can follow your character along the road if you wanna take your time and see the sights you can sleep and wake up at your destination if you feel like your character could use a nap... got a long trip to make but dont feel like hoofing it the whole way?

Nothing bad happened.I kept going until I narrowed it down to the following combination of mods listed in mod overwrite priority USLEEP Realistic Ragdolls Flora fixes Immersive Creatures Skyrim Unbound Fantasy Soundtrack Project Does not overwrite Flora Overhaul XPMSE SkyUI ELFX Pure Waters Insects BegoneCrashes occurred when I start as a dragonborn in Roriksteads inn.

Nexus uses virtual directories to allow for multiple profiles. This is something that only MO could do prior.That being said MO goes about things in a different manner and stores installed mods in their own seperate folders. It then uses a symlink to hook into the TESV.exe on launch and trick the game into seeing all the mod files in the Data folder.

7002998,0,t3_4biqdg,I want to weigh on this discussion because I come from a time where AI was at its peak in all action gaming which was namely during the time quake  and quake  were popular and ai authors like MrElusive Stephen Polge Nelno Frog Frika Cryos Coffee and myselfarwingxl at the time were hard at work making deathmatch and coop ai bots thatA knew the layout of each mapB knew how the navigate prioritize points of interest and use them in each map andC complete objectives within the rules of the game.Since that time in gaming except for unreal tournament  and its predecessirs being the only commercial releases that had GOOD aibecause they had Stephen Polge as their main programmer AI has been continuously dumbed down more and more with every generation of action games to make them more accessible and sellable to the masses of players that refuse to buy something that doesnt let them sit back and be rewarded for least common denominator efforts.Did you know skyrims navigation and ai runs on the same exact code MrElusive wrote for the gladiator bots in the quake engine? Little do most people know part of what made nav mesh navigation good over waypoint and movement node navigation was because ais could calculate autonomously distances and shortcuts and thus pull off some interesting choices in terms of getting from point A to point B running jumping climbing using windows elevators etc. On top of that having a modular c interface allowed you to layer enough scripted reactions and weight them with fuzzy logic to make the ais choices close to organic. As long as you can get a couple of hundred different solutions per problem even if a percentage are faulty solutions triggered by the ai choosing a pseudoemotional reaction over a reasonable one you succeed at taking players off guard. think of how the ais in leftdead sometimes will try to save a downed teammate instead of helping you kill a tank thus wiping the party.We dont have that in mmos because it eats cpu cycles. We also dont have this in skyrim because it eats cpu cycles but more importantly it eats the patience of little kids who shelled out  bucks a pop for legendary edition who will turn around and refund the game for the next wow expansion or CoD release.Oddly thats just the way things are.But ask yourself this man. Seriously sit down and look over what youve done and poise yourself for this query Can you make ai that can play a game of capture the flag without shitting themselves? Then ask yourself can you make a game of capture the flag that is actually funchallenging without a single human being playing with and against you?

You can apply AI packages to the NPCs but as long as theyre disabled then they wont interfere with the game before their enableparent is enabled. I think the main problem will of course be compatibility and Ive noticed a bug with my mod that enabling a lot of staticsmovable statics can lead to infinite loading screens if theyre enabled as soon as you enter a city.

7282074,0,t1_d25utsv,So basically Skyrim saves in bit format which means there is roughly a k string limit before saves will no longer load. You dont need to understand what strings are but some mods add strings to the game. The base game  dlc  USLEEP  Alternate Start  k! Thats around  of our total already gone.From what you are describing I suspect your butting up against that k limit. Strings in a game increase over time so there needs to be at least some cushion room if someone wants to play a save for a long time. Right now starting at or over k will probably result in an unplayable save after about  hours.The document I linked you to is the currently compiled rough estimate of the number of strings various mods add to a game. It also includes links to various forums that are discussing the problem those forum threads are where I got almost all of my data from. I recommend checking out the nexus one because the guy who started it includes instructions for testing string count in a save. If you still have any of your old saves try testing the last save that you could load. This is a super recently discovered problem which only effects a very small number of players potentially including me who install EXTREMELY heavy load orders. That said even commonly used mods can be heavy hitters including an older version of DYNDOLOD. The author of DYNDOLOD updated the mod and a player who updated to the new scripts saw a k decrease in the number of strings present in their game.So what does this mean us heavy mod users should do? Well testing string count in a save made immediately after starting the game is a good idea then spending some time doing a test run to see if we are safe. Its better to test for  hours to see if youve got enough cushion room than to play for  and discover your save is done for.,skyrimmods,d25x99p,2,t5_2sqqh

7773790,0,t1_d3ps2r4,Im just to irritated with the insistence that NMM is.. fine.  Its not the optimal best way to mod and as far as Im usually concerned its one the easy ways out.  Using it almost always ends out in problems down the road.  We have a sidebar solution for the majority of problems except for oddly complex or hard to diagnose ones but they all relate to MO.   I dont disregard that NMM can probably do fine for extremely small mod lists.  Similar to just subscribing on steam.. but most people who start modding dont stick with.. small lists.  Even if they dont go insane with  lists and having to learn merging.. they generally dont stop at  mods.   We have so many help threads for NMM people over the last few weeks that all ended out being simple stuff MO couldve told the user in like  seconds.  Also mind I started modding with NMM I didnt know MO existed.  I almost quit modding because of it until I stumbled across the STEP guide here.  Some of the people who come here.. know about MO but just dont feel like doing any work.. theyd rather just download click on and have the people of this subreddit diagnose their problems in my experience.,skyrimmods,d3ptf9i,1,t5_2sqqh

Telling them where they can and cant fly while airborn. Sort of serving as their navmesh. There is no solid proof of this though. Heres the thing. If this was true at all this would have been discovered within hours of Dawnguards initial release since its the first DLC to introduce this field. There are no widespread reports of people being unable to access Castle Volkihar by way of the boat. There are no widespread reports of people getting thrown back to Solstheim trying to return to Windhelm. There are a scattered few incidents of both of these that can be traced back to misunderstanding what an ILS is. The scenario you are describing where you get the load screen but are thrown back is EXACTLY what Ive found to happen through my own testing when the game borders are wrong. Or when you attempt to fast travel to a map marker that exists outside of them. With thousands of mods in the game not forwarding this data because why would they  it requires DLC there is no way that it being missing is going to matter. Every mod would break the game. Bethesdas own DLC would break the game because Dragonborns MHDT data will clearly not be taking Dawnguard into account and viceversa. So just the mere presence of Dragonborn in the game should cause Castle Volkihar to get blocked. And before someone says this can only be corrected for PC with mods stop and think. The consoles are using all of the same data files we are. Beths forums and tech support would be awash in complaints if this data had the effect thats being claimed here. They have no means to patch their games on consoles.,skyrimmods,d3w7vn8,1,t5_2sqqh

I have a ti GB  active mods  plugins ENB. My current game runs super no stutter good fps. You can in fact draw more from total available video memory than  due to shared system RAM. Ive had ingame video memory reported at high as MB in Win . I recently dual booted on a separate SSD Win . Tested Win  for a bit wasnt crazy about it nuked it and reverted to Win . This whole  limit thing IMO has been blown out of perspective. I mean absolutely I wish Microsoft would fix the bug but its not as though Win  is a miracle cure all or anything. If your ingame video memory draw isnt consistently well above GB the dx bug is a nonissue. That applies to your GB Titan X too because even without the dx bug playing Skyrim you would never use all that VRAM anyway.,skyrimmods,d43x7hz,12,t5_2sqqh

The idea was as the Champion of Mephala the best kills were treacherous ones   where allies suddenly turned against each other ran away in terror or calmly came and offered up their neck to the Ebony blade. Worked really well with Perkus Maximus due to the way poisons and illusion magic are overhauled.  Later on you could get creative too  reverse pickpocket an adhesive explosive on someone then hit someone else with a frenzy poison arrow.

Its unfinished. Its not lorefriendly unless you close your eyes and just pretend its all across the sea and the Chaos Lords really ARE daedra but the voiceacting was excellent the dialogue was pleasant and the mod did some really unique and innovative things in its time  a companion who could heal and buff you might not be novel anymore but when it came out it was phenomenal.Its unfinished because the author vanished. The voice actress posted every now and again for months to let people know shed recorded lines for the next update she was trying to get in touch she was very excited about the project...but of course the guy never showed up again. So its dead been dead for years. Is that good? I dont think so. People who release mods that are unstable or badlydesigned and then refuse to improve thats not good either. You can tag their work and make it publically known but you cant fix it. I think plagiarism once discovered has its own punishment when it comes to the eyes of the community and I also think this is relatively lowconsequence plagiarism. Thats pretty much my stance. I dont entirely disagree with you or think that the things you want  respect recognition good content  are unreasonable. To be clear you absolutely deserve all three and someone who fails to give them to you is in the wrong. Its just that I feel like the communal nature of modding is proof enough against people being jerks and that plagiarism is the lesser of two evils compared to the opportunity cost of closed source modding.,skyrimmods,d4kiqtw,1,t5_2sqqh
8046858,0,t1_d4kjbmw,I dont know if you read my early replies to the OP but this is going very much into the complex legal area of letter of the law versus spirit of the law. Letter of the law is what it actually says and is usually pretty binary it says one thing via strict wording. Spirit is what the law was actually intended to represent and the intent of people who made it at the time. Often times its weighing up on how the particular incident comes about and figuring out if the letter or the spirit is more applicable and the risks of voting either way and then trying to come to a resolution that obeys the letter without ignoring the spirit or via versa. Law sucks Im with you there  Australian law is no better. I think mostly its because so many of our laws were written in such a different era by old farts who couldnt possibly have forseen the sort of complexities we are dealing with today and its really hard to see where the line is when you go from applying the law to misunderstanding it a lot of the time. Look up the Zong case if youre interested it was an old British case from the slavery era and it dealt with this whole sort of situation. Im sure theres better examples out there but that has the most publicly accessible info as  far as readability from the ones I can think of off the top of my head in this exact moment. Okay Ill get back on point now. I dont actually think the Nexus gives it greater importance then it has it just is a lot more rigid in informing it but then the Nexus also walks a very fine line as Ive mentioned else where in their thread and they really dont want to rock the boat legally in case it comes back on them in other ways which I totally understand. To be clear though the only reason people can actually chose to mod openly is because they own their files as well and therefore they can make that decision for themselves. Its that horrible delicate balance with legal stuff where the same laws that limit are often the same laws that enable you to do stuff like that. Like weve said law sucks ,skyrimmods,d4kjjw5,1,t5_2sqqh

Considering this has been common knowledge for over a decade this is a pretty......dumb question.Its like asking if McDonalds is gonna gonna stop selling fries because you walked into a McDonalds yesterday and you didnt see anyone order any fries for the entire  minutes you were there.Youre assuming everyone is going to migrate to Skyrim Remaster which isnt going to happen unless modders dont have to convert anything and only something like SKSE needs to be updated and none of the mods that uses it. Either way the fact that youre assuming people will be migrating to it suggests that you feel like modding wont be ending.Not to mention Beyond Skyrim is still being worked on that huge German mod thats basically another game with Skyrims engine is being worked and pretty much done is still coming and then theres Skywind which is still being worked on. There are plenty of being quest mods being worked on that people arent announcing publicly and only talking about it on their own forums.FrostfallLastSeed is just one mod. Its the end all be all mod that defines the game. Mods just get to a point when theyre done and other mods keep coming out. Skyrim modding will continue strong until TES comes out.The only thing that should cause concern is if people are going to only make mods for the remastered Skyrim instead of regular Skyrim and if one will work with the other. Only time will tell for that. In that case it does make one wonder why they wouldnt just update regular skyrim my guess is so they can have an excuse to sell it for  dollars to console players as a new game.

Daedric Lords are often considered evil however history proves them to be apathetic which may even be worse. Daedric Lords dont care about human lives no matter what any worshiper may say. They care about what you can offer them and thats it. For many of the Daedric Lords what you can primarily offer them is entertainment a few others want you to perform rituals and actions and a few genuinely want your loyalty and adoration but they all only care about you if you can offer them something.,skyrimmods,d59o17b,8,t5_2sqqh

Ill disable onetweak by renaming it onetweak.dll.bak and borderless is already reenabled in the ENB file.EDIT Typically the game will CTD within  minutes. Sometimes immediately when it comes to the p and sometimes  minutes in. Rarely did I play up to an hour let alone over an hour. With that said if this test disabling onetweak.dll doesnt crash after an hour I can either keep playing for the record of  hours or try Arclines settings.EDIT it took a few hours about  but it crashed. This is still a HUGE improvement over crashing within  mins or even instantly upon loading a save. Still it doesnt seem to be any different than having onetweak.dll enabled and having the line in ENBlocal.ini enableddisabled either way.Ill leave the borderless lines enabled in ENBlocal.ini and reenable onetweak.dll then test arclines setup.,skyrimmods,d5fdxik,1,t5_2sqqh

Traditionally they stop just above the groin but every culture does it a little different. A dress is just a form of robe. Robes take many forms from sarongs to habits. A skirt goes from the waist down either stopping at the knee or at the ankle. Skirts are generally worn under something else though exceptions like the kilt are a thing. Mail skirts are definitely a realworld thing  they were worn under hauberks to lengthen them.If youre going to bring up hakama then you have to make the distinction between umanori and andon bakama. Umanori is a form of trousers and andon bakama is a form of skirt. Yoroi hakama are the armored ones and those usually are trousers not a skirt.,skyrimmods,d5r9o47,8,t5_2sqqh

8549231,0,t3_4wvgx2,Extra Ninja Bling is a way to brute force hack your games shaders to seem more like DX than DX by adding really cool stuff like dynamic DOF out of focus background when looking at foreground objects shadow fixes soooo necessary Godrays and selfshadowing Screen Space Ambient Occlusion as well as different colour palettes different bloom levels etc. As its a hack no way around that its making your videocard do stuff the game shouldnt tell it to it hits FPS varies by preset and your system but there is always some performance tradeoff. Worth it for the shadow fixes and ambient occlusion alone as vanilla shadows no matter how you set them up are lacking.Which one? Pure taste and personal preference. I use Phinix as its vanilla but improved looking but that means boring to someone else. Head to Nexus look at the usersubmitted images to get a better idea than someone elses recommendation take your pick RTFM enjoy use shift and F to realise how much nicer your game looks with it than without.Does it really stand for Extra Ninja Bling?

8618249,0,t3_4xtux3,Yeah...I didnt do this and now have a serious problem. Bit of background information first. I have a very healthy and solid original Skyrim heavily modded. Enderal I wanted to try out but not risk anything happening to my original skyrim. Ill try explain things. Enderal works  fine. I made a separate vanilla folder of skyrim to install enderal into which worked fine. Renamed my original skyrim something else so enderal would recognise Vanilla skyrim as the one to install in. Now I tried to swap the names back in order to test my Modded skyrim. Now modded skyrim is completely fucked whenever I try to load the game it boots into a crashfreeze black screen with a little loading circle Much like it is when a program doesnt respond. I love Enderal but I want to be able to keep my Modded skyrim too. Before anybody asks me why I didnt do the original launcher I was worried about the potential consequences. I guess I should have listened. Problem is I have no idea how to fix it. ,skyrimmods,d6ivpin,1,t5_2sqqh

8797356,0,t3_50it4d,Simply put the Virtual Folder is the place where mods are actually installed. Then when you enable the mods in NMM NMM places some shortcuts in your Skyrim folder. This makes Skyrim believe mods are installed in Skyrim folder when technically theyre not.Think of it like that. NMM installs mods somewhere else and places shortcuts in your game. Exactly like how you place shortcuts on your Desktop but the actual file is elsewhere.So no you cant delete these virtual folders. Its really bad to do that.I suggest changing to Mod Organizer instead of NMM for a cleaner Skyrim. Its better on all levels and keeps Skyrim clean all the time.

Any performance hit completely depends on you.DynDOLOD is not complex. It is easy to install and to generate LOD. The perceived complexity may be because it does  different things combined into one. Or maybe because it is a patcher that allows people to customize what they want instead of being a stale and outdated mod like SkyFallsMills.Why even bother to mod if you can not follow a simple and straight forward guide. Why even bother to mod if you can not even be bothered to read descriptions a quickstart a manual or watch a video.

8955069,0,t3_52egvh,Skyrim has been my first modding experience and its definitely been a blast. But I do have a few questions. I have been delaying doing any serious modding until I completed all the main questlines for the dlcs which I finished last week. Ive been following Gophers tutorials which Ive found helpful and informative. I have USLEEP SKSE the HD dlc SkyUI and the k texture pack lite and downloaded a few other small mods I have yet to try out. I have been running skyrim on the laptop I bought last Cyber Monday and while performance has not been an issue so far its definitely my biggest concern. Its probably worth noting I have yet to get around to installing ENBoost or Wrye Bash.So my questions are How will I know if Im experiencing save bloat or other serious issues less obvious than ILS or crashing? What type of visual mods have the greatest impact on performance? What are some common signs of dangerous mods aside from ones that are well documented? And finally how does modding skyrim compare modding other games?For note my laptop has gb ram a . ghz processor and a geforce m graphics card and has been running the setup detailed above smoothly so far.,skyrimmods,d7o9k9m,1,t5_2sqqh

9084985,0,t1_d83ugd2,Collision is such a pain... ive tired many times to set it up as well. Its not a huge deal and with something like a blacksmiths workbench it doesnt matter that much I suppose. I did read something about how hes only started with the meshes But his textures seem to be more of an issue than his meshes. At least in these two mods ive looked at here. Not so long ago I was a beginner and knew nothing but I would never release something I knew was flawed or subpar and if I did release something that i later found out was and done poorly SnowyWindhelm . I would work to fix it. These issues I mentioned arent new to him hes been told over and over by a bunch of people about how his normals are poor his seamless textures have errors ect. With his Poppy mod thats been rereleased I told him the first time it came out that the meshes are too dense and that  polys is too much for a flower mesh... he said he knew and he would redo it. The rerelease uses the same exact mesh...It doesnt seem like he cares and is content to making things the way he feels like without taking others advice. So while I dont expect professional level work from anyone in the modding community most of us are just amateurs I do expect people to learn when the better half of the community tells you the same thing for  months. I dont mean to come off as a dick because I like Ren and hes very enthusiastic about making mods which the community needs more of his energy but im just frustrated he hasnt listened and theres yet another one of his mods in the hotfiles that could be so much better but is instead limited. I was about to write him a message and link to this post. Ive tried to commenting on his mods but that doesnt seem to work very well. He does get a lot of rude or mean comments so I fear mine would just be taken that way. ,skyrimmods,d83v8dl,8,t5_2sqqh

9139907,0,t1_d8afujo,This definitely looks like nlva i dont like the enb part of it as i think it looks flat if you press shift you can see diableenable enb and see how the game would look without less saturated and gloomy. For roads there is real roads which replaces the flat roads with textures. For grass there are several choices. I like verdant but it is a huge performance drain then theres unbelievable grass two which looks almost as good as verdant but doesnt hit performance so hard. If you have a beefy PC you can also consider sprucing up your flora with the lush and large version of enhanced vanilla trees  you wouldnt think how much of a difference big trees make.Consdering nlva i love the weather esp of it best clouds ever BUT i am not a huge fan of realistic enbs. You can also use another enb tailored for nlva weathers. I use rudy atm and love it  a little hard on performance but very cinematic it doesnt push fog that far away which looks atmospheric  ill share some pics after breakfast.

9182614,0,t3_55p992,Okay  heres what happened. I went on about my merry way trusting that the game would place Delphine where she needed to be upon arrival at Kynesgrove. I played for quite a few hours and got sidetracked by some miscellaneous quests and when I finally got back on track I was passing through Riverwood yet again  at least  ingame days later. There she was still standing there outside the inn. I figured since I had already gone past that save hours ago Id just let it play out when I got to Kynesgrove. A few more side quests and a carriage ride to Windhelm later I was approaching Kynesgrove when Iddra came running down the hill as normal screaming about the dragon attack. When I got to the burial mound on the hill however Delphine was still nowhere to be found. I used moveto player and she appeared and went straight to her scripted spot crouched behind the stone. Yada yada yada I kill the dragon no script glitch Delphine behaves as she should the quest completes and Diplomatic Immunity starts with her saying to meet her in Riverwood while she figures out how to get into the Thalmor Embassy  AND THEN SHE JUST STANDS THERE. Shes supposed to leave again to go back to Riverwood at this point and shes just standing there. I mean I dont have so much of a problem with this if I can teleport her to me with console commands but this could be a real problem later.Tldr I used moveto player at Kynesgrove and the quest completed as normal but Delphine is still doing the weird thing where she doesnt go anywhere and I guess it will eventually either fix itself or Ill just deal with it with console commands.,skyrimmods,d8fyplm,1,t5_2sqqh

But the blanket statement that a better GPU will not help is just wrong. It night not help if you already hit a CPU wall in specificJKSMIM heavy locales but everywhere else your minimums will be glued at  thus an overall benefit.All I can say is my GPU upgrade allowed me to use more and more intensivequality mods than before.

Ive never double checked this but the Deadly Dragons author did and mentioned it in an article years ago.I dont need hundreds of saves per character and dont need my save folder to become excessively large. Even if I were to lose progress from a mod breaking Im not going to load a save from a dozen hours back because at that point Ive lost those hours and Im not going to want to replay them. Dont see any reason why never deletingoverwriting saves is better than rotating X amount per character. Unless of course you just like having all your old saves andor plan to maybe use them again which I dont think is likely for most people.,skyrimmods,d8w9549,1,t5_2sqqh

9409697,0,t3_59hkv6,So ASIS could actually be the culprit and disabling ASIS mid playthrough can create instability especially in loaded cells im surprised you game even started with ASIS deactivated. Improved INI files likely wouldnt help with asis related instability unless your spawns are higher as the spawner doesnt know when to quit with the old ini files. ASIS may have distributed items to NPCs that should have been exempted. You could check asis in tesvedit and compare records with clockwork and see if you can tell if there were any asis additions to clockwork that shouldnt be there. You could also just eliminate all the things distributed to clockwork . . stuff. . but that could cause issues if you are in cells wclockwork stuff.  Is it like when you draw your weapon? Or when youre fighting? I wonder if ASIS was ran on mods that it shouldnt have been. I think youre on the right track when you say you think asis is the culprit. When you run asis you only want to have active mods that spawn enemiesNPCs as asis distributes perks and does things like enchantfix. The ASIS page gives instructions as well on what to decative when running asis as I believe you need to deactivate your bashed patched and other things as well. Its possible you ran it with improper mods active.

9472279,0,t1_d9b9dgu,gtTrue its nearly been  years but I dont think they worked on it for that long. I have a feeling it was one of the cash grab ideas that someone decided on to make a quick buck because look people are still playing Skyrim after  years we gotta cash in on that!I think the special edition rerelease is them capitalizing on the continued community interest in Skyrim and is a replacement for the payed mods idea as a way to continue to monetize that interest. It will also slowly introduce and condition the idea of payed mods to a more casual audience through a more closed and easily controlled platform that seems less egregious because it is not a burning anarchocapitalist tire fire. The mistake of launching paid mods through steam is that not only was it poorly thought out but it was introduced into an existing ecosystem of hardcore fans and modders. Valves hands off approach was also terrible. High quality fan expansions seem like something that is actually valuable and introduced away from the baggage of the original modding system is a good idea and would preserve that system for those who want to keep it or use the new one moving forward.,skyrimmods,d9gnvws,1,t5_2sqqh

9614851,0,t1_d9y2i5r,So there is a relatively simple way to fix this yourself as long as you have SSEEdit. It may seem daunting it did to me but its actually very easy. Its not as easy and customisable as Timing is Everything but I find it good enough.Start by loading the DLC esp you want to delay. For Dawnguard open the Global tab and find DLCVQMinLevel. Right click on it and select Copy as override into.... and create a new file. Then change FLTV  Value in your new file to whatever level you want the quests to start at. Do the same for DLCVQMinLevelVampireAttacks to delay vampire attacks. You can add the second override into the same new file though. Now click CtrlS to save your new esp.So for Dragonborn I chose to change the main quest stage needed to the very last quest. To change the quest required find the DLCCultistAmbushNode under the Quest tab. In that you will find a condition which talks of stage  of The Way of the Voice. Change the quest and quest stage by selecting Copy as override into.... and continue as above. I find that the easiest way to find out quest stages is the UESP wiki. I selected the quest Dragonslayer andsaw that quest stage  was the final stage of that quest. You can probably choose any quest in the game world Im fairly sure it doesnt have to be a main quest.I hope this helps you. uKiloD might be interested too.,skyrimmods,d9y881a,15,t5_2sqqh

General loading times also increased to  times their normal length and Ive experienced my first CTD with the SE.Ive since removed the mod again and SSE is back to regular functionality  quicksaves save quick loading times are back to normal as well. No CTDs no nuttin.I have absolutely no idea what caused this issue but it seems tied to Simply Optimized Textures. Just as a headsup if anyone has similar issues.,skyrimmods,da188q3,0,t5_2sqqh
9639414,0,t3_5cx15o,Maybe Ill post a picture later but here goesTheres a bit longer of a backstory but I think some of it is inconsistent. But her names Fay. Shes a Breton whos around her late searly s whos traveled to Skyrim for the first time. Her dying mother wished for her to find her true destiny in Skyrim and continue her mothers scholarly work in ancient Dwemer ruins and practical magic.After arriving in Solitude she stumbled upon a strange sapphire circlet in Radiant Raiments. While it looked very similar to all the other jewelry around the dull aquamarine tint and scratches on the side reminded her of how her mother used to describe her husbands gift to her when they were little. The two traveled often to Skyrim and this circlet was lost on one of their many journeys. With both her parents now gone this would serve as a good memoir of them. After being unable to barter with the stingy merchant Fay unabashedly stole it and slipped off to see the rest of Skyrim. Shes a newly discovered Dragonborn specializing in magic alchemy and enchanting. While shes become very adept at combat while traversing Skyrim and possesses a sense to do what is right her most passionate pursuit is the pursuit of knowledge and discovering as much from Nordic and Dwemer ruins as she can. While she learned much from the Greybeards when Delphine of the Blades tried to pull her into the ongoing dragon crisis Fay angrily refused and walked out on her thinking to never return. She had fought a few of the dragons but was in no hurry to play a political game especially if Delphine was right and the Thalmor were behind it.Shes quickly discovered however that no matter how much she runs away the haphazard behavior of Skyrim may put all of her intellectual ambitions on hold. As she left the inn where she and Delphine had their argument a trio of master vampires almost killed her. Fay fled further west to Markarth where perhaps she could find some solace in the abundance of Dwemer artifacts likely laying there. However upon arriving a man confronted her perhaps out of her experience in fighting a few vampires requesting that she join in the cause against the vampire menace. Taking this to be a sign that she must stand and confront this threat she set off back east to join the Dawnguard.,skyrimmods,da198gm,2,t5_2sqqh

9668310,0,t1_da4rrqc,I took my downvote back cuz I revisited your title and saw vanilla in the title. Since its not that broad generalization people could use it to benchmark their game on vanilla.  I mentioned Oldrim and posted Fallout  CPU benchmarks since SSE lies somewhere in between and in both of those occasions AMD CPUs give significantly worse performance. That didnt change for SEE either. Its just that even vanilla Oldrim wasnt too hard on ADM CPUs so it runs fine for SEE vanilla as well... but when modders push SEE engine further those AMD vs Intel differences are sure to surface again.  since JK Skyrim isnt a benchmark anymore for SEE i think we could see some even grater resource hungry mods.,skyrimmods,da4tl73,1,t5_2sqqh

If you hover over it it says Install a new mod from an archive.  Click it youll get the open file dialog.  Select the z file you downloaded .  It should recognize the structure and tell you everything is fine.  It might ask you to select the Data folder .  Either way you follow the onscreen directions and hit Ok.At this point you dont need to put it anywhere.  MO will add it to its mod library.  You will need to click the checkbox next to it in the mod pane to activate it.  The order in this pane determines load order.  I tend to drag it high since its a core file and required by a lot of stuff but it doesnt really matter because this particular mod cant conflict overwrite or be overwritten.  SKSE is a little different that way.As for clarity all I can say is that it makes more sense the more you do it.  MO and S.T.E.P have about the best documentation you are going to see in the modding community way better than anything provided by Bethesda and they cover far more complex material.

9801623,0,t3_5fm093,So k vs. k is just the size of the textures. k  x K x. More pixels more detail. However in an ideal world k diffuse and k normal would be nice on everything but Some authors feel that would take up too much space  k texture is either mb or mb depending if theres an alpha. So by making the normal k and the diffuse k it saves space and still looks pretty good. Skyrim is a bit special still because unlike a lot of newer games the diffuse maps hold a lot of information. In newer games the diffuse map is often just the color the texture is suppose to be. No shading lighting or roughness. Those are done by other maps. Skyrim of course doesnt do this so all this information has to be stored baked into the diffuse. So making the diffuse k makes more sense because it holds a lot of information. Personally I use k diffuse and k normal on most everything and k for every extreme cases like mountains.

Ive been meaning to open it up and write my own immersive descriptions but I havent had the time.I thought about it for a second and maybe assigning the spell to a kind of magic user would be more suitable than just spell categorization. For example instead of Pyromancy Firebolt you could call it Pyromancers Firebolt the colon and that kind of antiseptic formatting is what bothers me to be specific which is why I make this recommendationAs for the spell name if I were to try this I would avoid classification that wouldnt be used in general conversation between two magic users. Instead of Firebolt stage   Firebolt Stage  I would go with the standard Firebolt  Fireball  Fireblast for the missile and perhaps Incinerate  Inferno  Conflagration or something along those lines for the flamethrower type spell Think pokemon names I guess?.As for power level I would use offhand descriptions such as minor and major.Just suggestions! ,skyrimmods,dawcdmg,1,t5_2sqqh

9951093,0,t3_5i0vwk,I did not look at the mod before so what Im typing here is generally what I would do to port mods with USKP. Im also typing it from memory on my iPad.  Download files unpack BSA if there is one and note the BSA content to pack them again in BSA in the end but not now. Use zip to pack the files again if there was a bsa. Install using NMM. Launch SSEEDIT and select only the mod esp Right click after it finishes loading and click on Clean Masters then exit SSEEDIT and save the esp. Launch Ck File gt Data double click all official files  USSEP. Find the mod esp doubles click on it and make it Active. This is all on the same data window. Load it and yes to all errors. Save esp when it is done with yes to all errors. Close Ck. Open SSEEDIT and load nothing but USSEP and the newly saved ESP. Right click on the mod and apply a filter for conflict losers.  Click on the plus sigh next to USSEP to see all the conflict with it and start passing records from USSEP to the mod esp. Here is the tricky part some mod authors did some changes that overwrite USSEP on purpose. You have to use your logic to identify those and leave them as is. Save once done and you are done. You may want to uninstall and pack files into BSA like the original author intended. It is usually done for a good reason. Just dont lose the ESP you worked hard on.Edit I forgot to mention Meshes and Textuers need to be converted where needed. Usually Nifscan fixdds is good enough for textures and SSE Nif Optimizer for fixing  of meshes. ,skyrimmods,db4nix5,5,t5_2sqqh

10001217,0,t1_dbb30v7,Awesome so long as you find a medium that works for you thats what matters.As for your issue.  The short of it is that the texture is missing.  To find your missing texture you need to know which .nif d model is in play.  The .nif file specifies where and what texture is to be applied.  When Skyrim runs if it cannot find a texture the .nif is given a pinkishbluish default skin by the graphics engine.  I would guess this is a development tool default so that when the game was being built they could debug the many many .nifs in play.As I indicated you need to find out which mod is controlling the .nif file that is missing its texture.  And xEdit is the tool.  You will figure it out I have faith.  Learn the tool and mod on Sir.Cheers,skyrimmods,dbb6qwh,1,t5_2sqqh

But they are crap compared to the real freedom of making something in a unnuetered engine. We spent over  months so far in unreal working on our game and the worst  days of that  months were not the deadlines for greenlight or the  straight  hour workdays I did for getting ready for early access. It was the  days I spent making the quest for Skyrim we recently posted. Its popular kind of because its all people get to know. But most of the things you learn or fight for are useless as they are freely given in other engines. It also has a huge fan base and modders get some sense of selffulfillment from the number of downloadsendorsements when in reality less than  of the users really even give a fuck or know much about the author they just want free shit.

10210515,0,t3_5m6w1l,I havent used Ordinator before but Im using Smilodon in my current playthrough so I can tell you that the Timed Block message on a successful timed block comes from Smilodon.

On the Ordinator page it does have this caveat about timed blocking If you do not block an attack during this time you cannot attempt another Timed Block for  seconds second. Have you confirmed that the Ordinator version of timed block never works with either Wildcat or Smilodon also installed?

10264266,0,t3_5mvp2h,Any combat mod that doesnt remove stat regen staminahealthmagicka is simply a mod that tweaks wether combat is fast or slow in the isolation of that particular battle.  There are no connected dungeons each room is just an individual Arena irony in successesion.  Smilodon is a great mod!  But it is an Arena mod.  It makes Arena combat amazing but doesnt address dungeon exploration combat.  Let me explainA dungeon at present in vanilla or modded is just a series of isolated and unrelated battles instead of a slow burden of depleting resources as long as automatic regeneration exists.  As such any isolated battle is easily over come no matter how much damage enemies do or how many wound systems there are.  In fact with regen there are no healthmagickastamina stats per se rather healthmagickastamina are just cool downs.  Wait  seconds and off to the next battle.  Dungeons and dragons understood this way back in  and so did Elder Scrolls until skyrim.  a dungeon exploration should drain resources continuously until you restFor all its simplicity the two mods that remove health and magicka regen entirely make the duration of the dungeon the real challenge and not isolated fights.  You have to look at the big picture...the entire dungeon and not each battle in isolation.This is why dark souls is a challenge.  Its because by the time you get to the boss you have  estus flask and  health and why people hoard and never use potions and scrolls and other one shot items in skyrim.  Why use them when your resources regenerate at . out of combat and . in combat at minimum.Skyrim is the first elder scrolls game to add automatic health regen.  This turns inns and places to sleep simply into a quest stage for the dark brotherhood and makes people incapable of feeling good about combat either on adept or legendary.  One hit kills nor vanilla pillow fights are the answer. Nor are improved enemy AI. Regen just turns skyrim into a cover shooter game no matter how you tweak the system. The biggest irony is that the carry weight mechanic is the only real resource mechanic in the game.  The longer you are in the dungeon without interacting in the town with shop keepers the less ability you have to loot.  Combat in a dungeon should be like carry weight the longer youre down there the less combat you can carry until you sleep in a bed.  As each iron dagger or dwarven strut you loot gets you closer and closer to your default carry weight of  and you consider leaving to find a merchant so too each hit you take and spell you cast should have you asking should I head out and rest at an innFrostfall succeeds at what it does for example because the longer you are exposed to the environment the more difficult the experience becomes.  There is no Frostfall for dungeons other than the mental burden of leaving that iron dagger behind because youre at your carry weight limit ,skyrimmods,dc7idwz,4,t5_2sqqh

10598101,0,t1_dd8u03p,Im not  sure with that but the basic principle of using proprietary development software is as follows.Depends if you wanted to distribute commercially or not. If not thered be no issue. Itd be basically irrelevant just it is with Skyrim most of the time. But if you wanted to prevent someone else modding it or if you wanted to go commercial thats different. AFAICS you would have a hell of a battle to stop read injunct someone from modding it if you released it non commercially. That doesnt mean that the person was acting ethically  no way theyre a douche. But legally it would be hard to prevent.If you released it commercially  youd probably need to pay Microsoft either a royalty or a one off fee. Thats a common practice. Unreal works in a similar way and if you look at the loading screenvideo of a lot of recent games you see logos of the software used in their creation. If you did that then you could sue anyone who tried to screw with your work because you bought the licence of the tool used to create it and thus the IP is yours.Im being reductive but thats the basic principle.,skyrimmods,dd942du,5,t5_2sqqh

10602533,0,t3_5rmfly,Its late here and thisll be a bit rambly so please excuse any accidental incoherence!I think in the morrowind era the tools were basically shite and modders the whole group shared because they had to. The time needed to create or fix a mod was spent more struggling with the tools available trying to figure out why this did that etc. Modders shared info more freely because there werent any central stores of info on how to do a thing and because they wanted to ask for help in return. Nowadays you can look up the wiki or watch a video for info on how to do most tasks in the creation kit. The part that was so hard and drove the early sharing of everything is now fairly simple. Texture resolution amp model detail were both low. This made it easier and therefore quicker to create them. Since Skyrim in terms of Bethesda games anyway the detail needed to release a mod that wont get laughed atignored has increased hugely. Instead of a x or x texture its x k pixels or more  even up to k that users expect. Then theres the specular layer the normal layer...  Armored NPCs that used to have a polycount of maybe  can be compared to weapons with a polycount of  or more. The flexibility available in the creation kit for all its many flaws allows mod authors to create queststory mods as good  or better  than bethesda content in the original game. A few hundred lines of text story is no longer enough every line must be voiced music scored new loot to be using new models and not statchanged original game items and on and on...I agree the community was different. The people that modded in Morrowind didnt have s or s of thousands of people expecting them to produce flawless handholding gorgeous and deep mods. They didnt have page upon page of nasty selfish little trolls pestering them over x y or z. They didnt have to deal with users complaining again amp again amp again that their mod broke my game!!  only to find out  pages of rants and tweets reddit posts and multiple forum posts later that the user had another mod installed that was incompatible. most likely on both mods pages the authors said clearly and prominently dont use my mod with a.n.others mod  theyre incompatible!. And so spreads the rumour that your mod is broken or will ruin savegames or whatever. Thats not to mention all the times mod authors have been taken advantage of their good will amp intentions abused so that someone else can release some halfcocked variant whose users invariably end up bothering the original mod author since the one who made the mod theyre actually using doesnt have a frickin clue what theyre doing. Modding has changed.,skyrimmods,dd9kjmk,3,t5_2sqqh

10740032,0,t1_ddnproe,The way most modders get into modding is by breaking down the work other modders have done and figuring out how they did it and then applying that to their own ideas. Paid mods is going to encourage closed sourcing of scripts if not things like encryption of content and slam the door on this gateway and raise the barrier to entry into modding that much higher than it already is.Paid mods are going to make it more difficult to ensure compatibility between mods. Especially as a paid mod is likely going to be a more popular mod to begin with and thus will be the kind of mod users are asking for compatibility for.Paid mods are going to make collaboration even more difficult for modders. Currently all you really need is written permission to borrow or grant access to assets for others to use  injecting money into the mix invites by necessity a great deal of legal hassle and potential for litigation where none existed before.In the end the people getting hurt the most by paid mods are the modders themselves even more than the users.Finally if one as a modder has a highlyvaluable skill  such as D modeling or theyre a coding expert  market those skills for an actual job with a gaming company then or hell any company that needs those skills.

10791913,0,t3_5tuzjc,I agree with this post as we move into the future of TES and Fallout or whatever might come next in Bethesda Softworks open world rpgs I think its important for developers of all ilk begin to minimize menu management. We saw a nice leap forward in the design of the UI with games like Fallout  and dare I say ESO. The items inside of containers were displayed without loading our traditional inventory menus and ESO stacks the lootables into single containers when you kill multiple enemies in a close area. I also added mods in Fallout  that allowed me to eat off of the floor minimizing menu management especially in a Hardcore play through. Putting less weapons and armor in the worlds and emphasizing improvement of your individual weapons and armor and personal character improvement with specific weapons and weapon types I argue would provide more immersion than constantly opening menu after menuthere are  FO mods that allow weapon specialization last time I checked. The menu loop of searching for new and improved equipment opening the inventory menu favoriting the weapon to open in another menu only to find a better weapon that you have never used before and weighs considerably more and handles differently yet you know it intimately... only to rinse and repeat the menu loop when you go to equip another weapon that youve never seen or have used before. There are simple solutions where you could add a UseEquip option in containers this is good but Im interested in changing the way we look at menu management as a whole. If I asked people to name RPGs that dont require menu management the list is short and will usually consist of SideScrolling Action RPGs from the s or s. Its almost blasphemous to ask people to imagine creating or playing an RPG that doesnt require Menu Management and even now I feel like Im speaking in tongues and only other crazy people understand me. There is a mod in Oblivion called CraftyBits that allows you to add ingredients together in the world space by picking them up and putting them on top of various crafting boards. The downside is that you carry all of these and have to drop them from your inventory not that it isnt amazing work but it breaks as much immersion as it builds when you have to pull out your ElderBoy  for the th time to drop the same items for the th time. I bring up CraftyBits because it allows us to look at what building and making things in real time could be. How many old or abandoned camps are scattered in Skyrim if instead of carrying a tent with you and magically flopping it out of your ElderBoy imagine having a tile in game that you could drag the ruined parts from an abandoned camp onto the tile to rebuild the tent fire etc. With the Tile itself being the crafting board. This in theory could be applied to black smith forges or grindstones alchemy labs enchanting tables blahblahyaddayadda. My point cutting down on as many in game menus when you are creating an experience especially if its intended to add immersion is a necessity and I feel is the prerequisite if we ever intend to properly immerse ourselves in an eventual virtual reality Elder Scrolls or Fallout game. Not saying that VR is the end goal but putting yourself into the mindspace of a VR experience can help you to visualize how immersion breaking it is to constantly manage menu after menu. Forging hammer in one hand smiths tongs in the other stand over an anvil hit the molten ore with hammer? Meh its a start.,skyrimmods,ddt3yfi,1,t5_2sqqh

10827794,0,t3_5usyfm,Ive not heard anything bad about the author before. From the little reading Ive done in the comments section of the mod he seems fine. He also seems to help out other modders try to smooth over compatibility issues. I think IC is a great mod as it gives a bit of life to the cities and settlements via the schedules of their inhabitants. Yeah if you want Heimskr shouting  hours a day dont get it but I personally think its neat to see him take a break and relax to see Jon and Olfina banter atop the Whiterun walls Jenassa mix poisons presumably at Arcadias or Embry fall asleep in front of the bar come morning. Little touches like that I appreciate.And yeah some carriage drivers are away from their post like the Whiterun guy. But the author has smoothed over the issue by keeping him in the immediate vicinity. Hes either reading on a nearby rock camping next to his nearby tent or chatting it up at the stable. Now you cant miss him. Its also fine replacement for the Vampire and Dragon attack mods.  Anyway theres nothing to be afraid of. Just save in a separate file add the mod take a spin around Skyrim and if you like it use it with your main save. If you dont uninstall and delete the experimental save.

10959532,0,t1_deacdtl,gt Thats what I mean! Everyone talking about their personal experience you are not wrong. Of course you get a more stable skyrim with less mods etc ut that wasnt even the point.While this is true and most people recognize a lot of the performance improvements have to do with the reduced loadorder and the exclusion of a full ENB and SKSE there is definitely more to that simply due to dx  bit which was explained often enough in other posts.gt If you dont mess up your Oldrim you will likely get as I said maybe  crash every hours. Thats not a lie. Its how it fucking is and people wont believe it and keep praising SSE for its stability??It just makes no sense to me Not much denying that but that requires a lot of dedication and fine tuning which usually resides to only the most enthusiast modders in the community.gt SSE is a bad thing for PC Modding of Skyrim it only was used to get more money out of console players thats it.No its great but it will take more time to be fully adapted.gt We now have  seperate communits of mod for basically the SAME GAME. Alot of people wont port to SSE the other wont port to SLE. And this IS BAD.People are not as incentivized to create  port mods to SSE yet due to the lack of SKSE and a full ENB. Once these features hit home more modders are going to make a move because SSE is a better fundament for modding that OG Skyrim is.gt Bethesda still didnt give a shit about mod makers giving us the same ol shitty CK.

Bethesda can take a completed mod down from Nexus and sell it as a DLC they can say that authors must host their mods on Bethesda.net. This is a big deal. They are completely correct arguably this is bigger than the Paid Mods Fiasco. At least back then we were the ones getting paid for our work however small the cut might have beenI dont want to be the person who tries to dismiss this as being a small problem because I think this is a huge ownership issue but realistically would there ever be any situation where Bethesda actually would take down a completed mod from the nexus and sell it as DLC?I mean I extremely doubt they ever would given how highly they support the modding culture within their games and how for pretty much as long as theyve been around or at the least since Morrowind they never have done something to ever actively steal from the community.It still is a grave concern given that Zenimax are the ones that made these changes so I highly doubt anyone at BGS had a hand in doing this given they are only responsible for development.,skyrimmods,deghw2t,1,t5_2sqqh

Click the Referenced By tab on the right hand window and it should show up a list of records. What you need to do is go to each record with a signature of LVLI. If you are only running vanilla DLCs then this should only show up two records from Dragonborn xx dragonborn in your load order        DLCLItemArmorHelmetHeavy xxff        DLCLItemArmorHelmetHeavyBest xxbcf        Remove the Ebony helmet on this list then copy this record as override into a new esp. dont save Dragonborn.esm when you quit tesedit.        This removes Ebony helmets from all list. If you only want it to be removed from bandits then you have to go to the two records above and check again which records reference it. Again if you are only running vanilla then these are the records you need to edit        DLCLootBanditArmor xxbc        DLCLootBanditArmor xxbce        remove the ebony helmets from this list. Copy as override on new esp. Edit this new esps description File Header and add this at the end BASHDelev. Exit TESedit and save only your new esp. Activate this in your load order and rerun your bashed patch.    edit That last part will actually remove helmets from bandits terrible idea.

There are quite a few more of the newer mods on the top of this list than the bottom. Combat Realism was only first put on the Nexus after SSE came out even. Smilodon is newer than Wildcat.

It can be reasoned that many of the people living in Skvindts mods and Blackthorn are poor people or refugees.There is also the mod called Simple Raven Rock Expansion. It includes  ruined houses being repaired and used after you get the mine going again.For quest mods to help people the two I can think of are Faction Vigilant of Stendarr and The Notice Board. As a Vigilant you fight against evil monsters and cure the sick.,skyrimmods,dg8w4oj,2,t5_2sqqh

If you want to get your bowl back after you eat your soup set this global to  in the console dshunterbornsoupreturnbowl  If you dont want your soup to go cold did I mention theres a limited implementation of food spoilage included? then set this global to  dshunterbornsoupstayhot  If you like the realism of soup going cold but want it to last longer change the value of this float dshunterbornsouplifetime  The iNeed soup fix is a PEX replacement for snplayeralias. The source PSC is also included in the download. Two lines are changed  is commented out it needs SKSE and wouldnt compile otherwise it does nothing anyway and line  is nowElseIf SNQuest.SNFoodSoupList.HasFormFood || Food.HasKeyword Game.GetFormFromFilexCD Hunterborn.esp as Keyword The PEX is a loose file. It will take precedence over the iNeed BSA file. That means it does what its supposed to now but if iNeed SE ever gets updated you should remove this file so that it doesnt override the new BSA. That said Ill be switching to support of Last Seed eventually anyway.,skyrimmods,dg9qqsh,8,t5_2sqqh

You could then interact with them or choose to finish them off.The most recent version of this I found is Combat Surrender which gives you a bunch of configurable options around that.EDIT Kuertees Fight or Fly was the mod I used years back. All of Kuertees mods are top notch and highly rated so if you dont care for Combat Surrender Kuertee may have something better for you.,skyrimmods,dgb5y6v,3,t5_2sqqh

11652681,0,t1_dgfz0i6,gt However what I really want is a mod that gives guards totally different outfits per hold settlement etc. Does that exist for Oldrim or even a combo of mods that can achieve the same result?The Book of UNP  This mod kinda does what you want but it has a lot of skimpy armors included and the no skimpy patch made by the author doesnt really work the way its advertised so it might not really be your thing.
