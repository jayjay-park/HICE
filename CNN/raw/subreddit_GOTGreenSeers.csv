3664154,0,t3_32bas5,Glad to see ol Selmy in a fight finally! I want to say hes alive probably because he is one of my favorite characters in the book but at the very least Im pretty much certain he is unable to fight at least in the foreseeable future. I dont think Ive seen him in the fighting pits in the preview trailers when youknowwho comes to wreck shit up.,GOTGreenSeers,cq9xse1,3,t5_37sub
