5602413,0,t1_cwrir0z,Its a complicated line. I think some retooling could work if you were mainly targetting guys in the high minors or trades where at least some parts are likely to help the club in . OR you have a trade where your highest upside guy is a low minors dude but you get  other pieces that help out in  etc. Andrew Heaney was basically MLB ready when the Angels acquired him for Kendrick. ,BaseballOffseason16,cwrj7gy,1,t5_33dc9

5710377,0,t1_cx42qku,Mondesi and Cecchini kinda cancel each other out I dont think either of them make it as regulars in the majors. So for me this basically boils down to Grandy vs. Kelvin Herrera and for some reason k. Grandy is fairly expensive but not unreasonably so. Herrera is great but ultimately just a reliever. Id guess that Granderson ends up providing more value than Herrera does over the lives of their respective contracts.,BaseballOffseason16,cx4xf3n,4,t5_33dc9
