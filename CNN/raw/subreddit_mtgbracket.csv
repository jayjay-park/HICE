10037468,0,t3_5jcf71, Daru Cavalier is cool enough to vote for over an OK Zendikar Merfolk but arent Cavaliers supposed to be knights not soldiers? And its nice that Samite Healer isnt against anything terribly good or interesting  I doubt it was ever good but it does go back to Alpha and it along with things like Healing Salve was part of what taught the first generation of Magic players that preventing one damage wasnt nearly as good as dealing one damage. I know most of the voters will know this but Circle of Protection Black is one of two cards from Beta that werent in Alpha they were inadvertently left out. While were on ancient trivia lore Alpha had the iconic pair of Black Knight and White Knight both s for  with first strike and protection from each others colors.  Blood Knight from this batch was the Planar Chaos colorshifted version of Black Knight.  But Lodestone Golem is the recently restricted Vintage bugaboo as uNaiveMelodies implies so its hard to vote against either one. Forget the scavenge ability  Deadbridge Goliath is special just for being a  for  without a drawback.  There are only a handful of those  Polukranos Ereboss Titan Phyrexian Obliterator Spellbreaker Behemoth. Has anybody here actually built the Goblin BookieKrarks Thumb deck?  You can do some fun things... your chances of winning the Fiery Gambit with both in play go from  up to  if Im calculating that correctly. Leyline of Anticipation is our first Leyline  there were cycles of them in Guildpact and then in Magic  but there are only nine total because M reused Leyline of the Void. Interesting to see monks on a Black card in Morality Shift.  I guess theyre monks going bad?  In the largest version of the art I can find looks like the one on the left is drawing angels but the one on the right is drawing demons.  Its a cool card with a unique effect but just a couple mana too expensive to vote for against a fun red impulsivedraw card with Chandra channeling Jaya complete with goggles.,mtgbracket,dbfwprm,7,t5_3hf9i

10479018,0,t3_5q2d1y,When I first started playing Magic I owned five of the six Circles of Protection. No one in my group would trade me Circle of Protection White because then it would mean my white deck would be invincible.We werent very good at Magic back in .Bane of the Living used to be a weird card thanks to how X was defined in Magic with triggered abilities. Basically the card makes sense people understand it... but the rules didnt work that way. The official ruling is The X in the ability has the same value as the X paid in the Morph ability. This is pretty easy to derive since there is no other source of X.This is from back before Oracle rulings had attitude so it caused a bit of a stir.,mtgbracket,dcvwlae,10,t5_3hf9i
10648880,0,t1_ddeca6a,Yeah pretty impressive.  I guess the power level that Dack can get by not being subject to Standard development is pretty significant but Xenagos was a big player in Standard himself for his period.  Pretty convincing victory nonetheless and our second planeswalker loser.I am about  done with scheduling and entering the future brackets for Round  and theres at least one more planeswalker showdown to come ,mtgbracket,ddeclrm,3,t5_3hf9i
11099596,0,t3_5yeu9q,I had to vote for Solidarity not because of what the card actually does but because its responsible for the name of one of my favorite decks Reset High Tide in Legacy. Legend goes that the first person to pilot this deck had a single copy of Solidarity in their sideboard that they couldnt even cast so now the deck is forever referred to as Solidarity.,mtgbracket,deq4odo,5,t5_3hf9i
