8778729,0,t1_d72ibik,Possible Spoilers below?  Does this sub support spoiler tags?I dont know if Troy is being serious or not though.... maybe he rolled a  or ?  I bet we can reverse engineer the static damage.... to hit  Weapon Focus  BAB  STR .  Maybe?  So  is the static damage x    guaranteed damage.  Even earlier the highest he was rolling was about      ... I think they live.,TheGlassCannonPodcast,d730e4l,1,t5_3eoic
9279653,0,t3_57a10n,Ever since I discovered this podcast I have been eagerly looking forward to Tuesdays and the rest of the week between episodes feels eternal. So I never would have said that I was getting tired of the characters or that they were getting stale. But after these last two episodes I can honestly say that its been a long time since I was so excited for the new episodes I love both of these characters and I cant wait to get to know them more. The last few episodes have been amazing I commend the crew for being brave enough to take a risk and fix what didnt appear to be broken. ,TheGlassCannonPodcast,d8s9gzy,2,t5_3eoic

9518729,0,t1_d9maexb,I still cant work out why hes gone. I could understand if Troy and Joe were gonna side quest him and bring him back into the group at a later stage but from the sound of things  hes gone for good.Lorc was the heart soul and moral compass of the group.,TheGlassCannonPodcast,d9mdwnq,3,t5_3eoic
9913915,0,t3_5h6zhf,I run some PFS from time to time and looking forward to my first official AP in February.Troy has an amazing gift of keeping the group moving and not letting them get hung up on minute details. Cannon Fodder really helps with ideas in how to get the players more involved in the story and their characters.I am currently in a game on roll and its tough for us to really get into some deep role playing. We are only a couple of sessions in and starting to break that. I also like that the group doesnt debate over every decision to be made and work very much in tandem. ,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dazt1x0,3,t5_3eoic

11634520,0,t3_660lji,SPOILERS!!!Seriously there will be MASSIVE spoilers all through this thread. Turn away now if you dont want spoilers!!!...............Lorc lives! But damn  he wont be joining the party again anytime soon. Not unless Barron has a distant relative named Nargrym Steel Feet.I guess that really puts an end to the question will Lorc ever rejoin the group. I wonder who the two flayed guys are...?,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dgesah4,53,t5_3eoic
11678248,0,t1_dgjjvah,I swear it wouldnt be so bad if the fans werent so rabidly protective of it. Im a huge TAZ fan as well as GCP! and I cant wait until the story moves on to something new. I think Griffin has let the story swallow him up. ,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dgjqv5h,15,t5_3eoic
11729286,0,t3_675q6t,I was wondering how does alignment work anyway? How is using devils blood evil? Presumably the only one it hurts is the devil and hurting devils doesnt sound particularly evil. It seems like goodevil in Pathfinder is more analogous to paragonrenegade from Mass Effect to me at least for party characters..,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dgpjmuj,2,t5_3eoic
11729517,0,t3_675q6t,troy do you keep trying to kill the animal companions because they have less emotional attachment than real PCs or is there some inherent serial killer past to you that makes you hate animals?,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dgpkkt2,2,t5_3eoic
11729744,0,t1_dgpki4a,Hahaha. just Lorcs son....   JUST LORCS SON!? Who do you think you are?  No I dont know Lorcs son. Thats in Troys hands sadly for Lorcs son. I will never come close to commenting on backup character concepts so dont even try buddy!,TheGlassCannonPodcast,dgpli5c,10,t5_3eoic
