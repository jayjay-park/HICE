678313,0,t1_cghd4qj,Probably depends on your device and screen resolution. On my Nexus  I can find just about anything right at the point where it changes to ft on my G about halfway in between  and  zoom on iPad ft.No matter the device you should be able to find anything at  zoom level.,googlepokemon,cghdhtd,2,t5_315tm

681549,0,t1_cghqk7f,I tried all  locations at least  times each last night before sleep and check all  locations at least  times  this morning when i woke up Im living in  timezone. Done all sorts of things with different zoom level pan around the map till felt dizzy surfing along amazon river like crazy even bookmarked all places to speed up the searching process. Im  percent positive mew wasnt at the given locations before I restart the game. Of course there are multi possible locations mew can appear hence restarting the game doesnt guarantee success. But its better the researching the same god damn places again and again.,googlepokemon,cghqr0o,1,t5_315tm
