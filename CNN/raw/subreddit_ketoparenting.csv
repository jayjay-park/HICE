7049879,0,t3_4c5dwg,Youre going to have to have two talks one with just you and your SO and the other with the three of you together. The former should come first so you two are prepared for the latter together. Its hard to have this kind of conversation with an SO because it may and sometimes even if unintentionally comes across as accusative and restrictive. Use I statements and avoid you statements. Its a good idea to write all these out beforehand but dont have the list with you when you guys talk. Save the We statements for the closing of the conversation to input suggestions such as We need to provide and lead with a united example for our son.When your SO agrees to be more supportive and not undermine your efforts then the two of you can talk with your son about the issue. This should focus on how your son feels about the diet about his role and especially how he feels about getting mixed messages. His feelings and thoughts may provide insight into what to do next.Best of luck!,ketoparenting,d1fgmwc,4,t5_3dc7h
