5305385,0,t3_3nkw5c,Id like to interject for a moment. What youre referring to as gentoo is in fact gaygentoo... Why should I upgentoo it instead of upARCHing it? How dare you violate my freedom of being a superior ARCH user btw my IQ went up  points after I became accustomed to the ARCH way  by merely MENTIONING  no  just by even THINKING the word gentoo. How anyone can support anything other than ARCH  which not only I  but also all other brilliant Minds who arent even half as brilliant as me because theyve probably been using noobuntu or plebian or something even gayer before they saw the true glory that is nowadays known as ARCH is simply mind boggling. Honestly everyone whos life doesnt revolve around ARCH is probably mentally ill and homosexual. Even Einstein said lol use ARCH faggot  its the best which he has proven countless times. And why anyone would use a sourcebased distribution when ARCH exists whoose maintainers provide the utmost optimized and fastest packages is beyond me. Read the fucking manual and install ARCH faggot,LinuxCirclejerk,cvptoxi,6,t5_2s4yd
