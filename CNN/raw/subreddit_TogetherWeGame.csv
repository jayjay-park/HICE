1579853,0,t1_cjeauv8,Im still not entirely sold on the GMO theme but as a mechanic I like this ideaPollen is sprayed by plants and causes trait mixing between groups.Players could weed out undesirable traits or artificially seed desirable ones.Instead of upgrading their turrets they could artificially select them!Enemy sources could seed negative traits and players could encourage certain plants to grow with fertilizers or relocate plants by repotting them.I like this idea a lot actually!,TogetherWeGame,cjebalg,2,t5_32h1k

Her face resembles a cat with calm deep dark eyes and a hunger for meat. She has the strength pride and determination of both her families. Backstory Atlas Roara grew up in tall mountains some with snow some with fresh heavy greenery. Salty waves crash along the side of her wellkept cave that only she can fly to. After her father eagle and mother tiger were killed by Ebulazers tasked to destroy their wrongful love Atlas was taken away by a tribe who considered her godly as they worshiped the eagle and tiger. Now all grown up Atlas has vowed to protect those who stand up for love and destroy those who get in there way  all in honor of her parents who loved each other until the end. ,TogetherWeGame,ckzf2ef,1,t5_32h1k
