The actual word maps were made through Wordle As the rMUWs bot only does this in monthly increments a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. As I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness I used the HTML codes from this site for the colors. My apologies if these are difficult to see. Whats hardeasy for me to see has been easyhard for others to see before so I trusted in the site. Common words such as the and Im etc. were removed.

75945,0,t1_cemz9jd,Could our line get better?  Sure.  But its in no way bad  I mean we were th in the league at stuffing the run this year.  Certainly first would be better but inability to stop the run is not the primary reason why we lost games this year.  I think we have higher priorities.I particularly dont see the argument for drafting a NT.  We had the thranked run defense despite being without our starting NT all year.  Our DLine play will likely improve just by having Ian Williams back and Ray McDonald playing without an injured bicep.Yes Louis Nix might be an upgrade but is he enough of an upgrade to justify spending a firstround pick as opposed to upgrading our receiving corps or replacing all the CBs were losing?  Probably not.  And anyone we draft in the rd or th round is unlikely to play very much due to the amount of depth and talent we already have.  I think its very unlikely that well upgrade our DLine through the draft this year.Fundamentally I feel like DLine along with LB and RB is one of the positions we have the least need for right now.  Not that we wont take a talented prospect if he drops to us  best player available is always a good strategy  but I improving our already very good and already very deep DLine just doesnt feel like a priority relative to our other needs.,49ers,cen2pjc,1,t5_2rebv

Wilson just needs  ring to be a legend in Seattle Kap is expected to do more to achieve the status as an all timer for the Niners.

It drives me nuts watching our fans scream to keep running the ball while not getting anywhere to even be close enough for a rd down run.  x   first down while  x  means another punt.

And trying to dismiss a valid point by telling someone theyre in denial is kinda short sighted and a little tacky to be honest. If it was intentional which it could have been Im not dismissing that possibility no doubt that guy would have been shunned by the fans around him. If it was intentional than definitely that single fan out of over  fans was a dickhead. From everything I heard and saw though . of fans were respectful and genuinely concerned about the injury  that looked freaking terrible and no one wants to cause that kind of pain to their opponents in a sporting event. Sure it could very well have been have a dick head fan and out of  people youre bound to get a few of them in any city you visit. But it also could have been a clumsy dude trying to get a better view of the injury. Im not sure youre fully considering the possibility that the dropped popcorn was accidental either. There would be rushing to the railing because at that stadium people arent allowed to just stand at the railing because it blocks the flow of foot traffic through the bleachers. So people would be rushing and scrambling to the hand railing to get a better view of the injury as everyone would have been sitting down in their seats beforehand. Anyway we dont have any evidence regarding how the popcorn became airborne and there are tons of explanations for what could have happened. All we know is a small amount of popcorn fell from the stands. The way some people are describing it is ridiculous Seahawks fans threw food at injured players as they were carted off the field that sort of thing. Come on now thats clearly bitterness speaking. At most it was a single fan and we dont even know if it was accidental or not and food was really dry popcorn not hot dogs or sloppy joes or beer that one would think of when they think of food throwing I personally remember Mariners getting this kind of food thrown at them from multiple Yankees fans back in .  ,49ers,ceui0qu,1,t5_2rebv

160605,0,t1_cewc0ek,Excellent now that were in rers  where I dont have to add qualifiers to my arguments to not have them buried.Here is the gif broken down  This is every other frame.I agree the defendant is probably looking at Lane throughout the entirety of this gif  our only viewpoint. I also agree the defendant stepped forward into Lanes path. I will argue that you cannot prove intention and that it was far more likely an incidental collision. Throughout the walk through of the slides you will need to use the man in the white hat as a reference point.In the first slide entitled Frame  the defendant appears to be looking in Lanes direction approximately six inches behind the yellow line. As the slides progress the defendant appears to be moving forward as his head is increasingly eclipsed by the man in the white hat. This forward motion continues throughout Frame Frame  where it then appears the defendant is in front of the yellow line. This is exactly the same time frame it takes Lane to catch his footing and make a strong pivot towards the field.Id like to bring you back to the first slide where you can see the direction of Lanes helmet  the direction that a man is looking is the direction that man is going to run. You can clearly see even in the first frame that Lane is facing away from the field  still recovering from the push out of bounds. Compare Frame  with Frame  if you need a closer look at the direction that Lanes helmet is facing in Frame .I am arguing that the defendant made an attempt to get out of Lanes way by stepping forward to avoid a collision behind the yellow line. After Frame  where Lane is still headed away from the field the first step that he takes is in Frame .Once again using the man in the white hat you can see that once the defendant sees Lane is cutting back towards the field he makes an attempt again to get out of the way. In Frame  you can see the defendant begin to step back. This motion continues to Frame  where youll note the defendant is once again behind the yellow line.In Frame  the defendant appears to make a desperate final attempt to avoid a collision andor attempt to deflect the impact as to not absorb it by leaving his feet. This upward movement comes to its apex in Frame  and comes to landing in Frame . Id like you to note that the defendant has completely turned his hips upon landing as an attempt to deflect the impact of the collision.Here is the framebyframe of the collision.If you compare Frame  and Frame  youll agree that the impact occurred in Frame  as evidenced by the shadows of the creases that appear on the defendants jacket sleeve. This is further supported if you compare Frame  and  as the recoil of the hit begins to affect Lanes helmet.If you reexamine the impact in Frame  youll note that the collision occurred between Lanes helmet and the defendants bicep or shoulder area and not an extended arm or any other extremity.Although the defendant appears to be large in stature himself we cannot forget that Lane is himself large and a professional football player to boot  an intentional collision would not end well for either man. Its easy to say which way the defendant should have stepped with hindsight but of this was taking place in mere seconds and in an area the defendant was lead to believe was deemed safe to stand in.Finally  which even more subjective but what made me take a closer look in the first place  the defendants surprised face. If you look at the defendants face beginning in Frame  the eye appear to widen and his mouth opens into what some could call an oh shit face  although the quality is spotty at best.TLDR No You used the thread in rnfl as your soapbox to complain about how unjustly the Seahawks have been vilified and then crucified the defendant before we even had even this choppy slomo gif that were forced to work with right now  so no.,49ers,cewq59o,4,t5_2rebv

Thats how circlejerks get started.My unpopular opinion I like Kap and I think he has potential but if he wants more than  millionyear Id prefer we dump him after his rookie contract and pick up Christian Ponder on the cheap. If Harbaugh developed a working system around Alex Smith he could do the same for Ponder who has similar if not better numbers to what Smith had early in his career. Kaepernick is not worth torching our roster. People tend to forget just how bad Alex Smith was early on. I have more faith in Harbaughs ability to tool an offense to a QB than in our ability to draft cheap enough to replace some of the st round talent weve accumulated over the years that wed need to kiss goodbye to in order to pay for Kap.,49ers,cezhlg4,9,t5_2rebv

344852,0,t1_cfghm51,He was extremely successful at it his first four years on the job guiding the Steelers to two Super Bowl appearances and one title. Management has made his job much tougher since. Tomlin was infamously forced to part ways with successful OC Bruce Arians while the state of his roster has steadily aged and deteriorated thanks to dubious cap management from GM Kevin Colbert. Tomlin has done all thats been asked of him and more but with little say over his personnel and offensive and defensive philosophies its grown harder to pinpoint what exactly hes allowed to do. That would make it hard for any coach to exert his influence. It also makes it easier for the Steelers to find their scapegoat if things continue to trend downward in .I wont say hes my favorite coach especially after the sideline fiasco but you cant take away his success.

We likely do not see the draft as deep as most of the draft media outlets do and are concerned that the limited number of guys we like at the position might be out of reach of our board. I would wager they are fully prepared to not take a corner should that happen and didnt want to be sitting there in mid May with free agency already over and major questions at CB.

We acquired Baldwin who is the most physically gifted WR on the team late in the process for Jenkins and Patton was out early with injuries which forced K Williams and Moore to have to be used as a rd WR.  Thats as much as certain players not stepping up Patton and Baldwin when we were desperate for somebody to do so as it was difficulties using both of those guys  learning the playbook and getting healthy.Jenkins was obviously a big miss but its telling when our prospects cant be out guys who the coaching staff never had any real intention of playing at WR.

It would make sense that with more time after his season his injuries would lessen and allow him to run faster into the draft process but he felt a performance done in February was the best he was going to do.  He had the highest drop rate of the top  WR prospects  nearly triple what watkinsevans had.  That has nothing to do with injuriespoor qb play  thats poor hands.  I dont think Latimer is a first round prospect and I dont think Lee is either.  There is no part of his game thats better than the other top  prospects.  And the fact that he regressed this past year is really disconcerting when prospects tend to improve their technique football IQ and production as their college career progresses.  Yes he had some injuries yes he no longer had Matt Barkley and yes his catching technique is generally poor and could possibly be revamped.  But he just seems . .underwhelming and new question marks have arose.If you like Lee so much because of his production Jordan Matthews had more yards more receptions in a more difficult conference on a worse team . .

He is blinding hating because his team got stomped three times by Kaep.Kaep is a good if not great QB. People who really watched the niners last season would see that he had no help whatsoever from his receivers outside of Boldin and Davis missed a few games. Harbaugh modified the playbook too and basically forced Kaep to stay in the pocket and dont run. Come playoff time and BAM the old Kaep strikes again playing very well against the Panthers and of course the Packers.People talk like the Niners lost the NCFCG because of Kaep. BULLSHIT. Gore disappearead and if not by Colin it wouldnt be even a close game he had amazing plays like that yd scramble and that laser to Boldin in the enzone burning Thomas.Sorry for the rant on your sub niners fans but I hate retards.,49ers,chzc2cu,60,t5_2rebv

The salary tier for elite tight ends cuts off at . He thinks he belongs with the best not within a stones throw of every other tight end who just got a free agent deal. Id agree with him.

1904597,0,t1_ckimiyg,As a Bear fan I might see this a little biased but Contes interception was improbable at best and a tremendous athletic play that I cannot see many players doing. And Conte is not a bad safety he just got saddled with the short stick at the worst possible times. Like I tell my more emotionalless rational fellow Bears fans lay off Conte that reputation for not being skilled is undeserved.Fullers INTs were phenomenal grabs the first being which he outright stole it from Micheal Crabtree He had the catch from the good angles I saw on the grab and the second being an amazing heads up play you would never expect from a rookie or even a lot of veterans. He had enough presence of mind and vision on the QB to break his coverage and make a play I wouldnt have expected anyone to make. I dont fault Kap for any of his INTs as they were all amazing and crazy plays from our secondary. We being Bears fans were absolutely stunned and elated by those plays.The things that you can truly blame on yourselves are  The penalty count which just got out of hand and for a lot of stupid shit that will get called every time. We had bad penalties too but it was just brutal to watch all the calls and then see the followup that made every single one of those calls legitimate. Refs called a mostly good game but both teams were really sloppy especially in the first half.  No pressure on Cutler he had days to throw and our injured receivers had time to make double moves to get the clearance they needed to make plays. Your Dline was getting manhandled.Regardless you guys are a good team and not many people even diehard Bears fans thought that you would lose. I know my own father had Cutler slated for  picks like last time we played you at home. Dont get down on yourselves Im sure Harbaugh will kick the team into gear in practice.,49ers,ckioxmf,6,t5_2rebv

Our offensive line gave Kaep very little time for anything...forcing him to scramble more and throw the ball when he shouldnt have and our secondary was unable to cover two injuried WRs...let alone anyone else.After the Cowboys game and now last night it seems to me the Niners have a real problem keeping the intensity going. The talent is there as we saw in the first half. The Niners just feel like great boxer with a glass jaw...everything is great until a couple good hits from their opponent.Not hitting the panic button here but they will need to toughen up a bit as a team be able to weather the mishaps and miscues bc they will happen and learn to play smarter ball when things arent going are way.  ,49ers,ckj2mks,1,t5_2rebv

I thought Anthony Davis had a history of running his ignorant mouth on Twitter anyway. Who knows maybe Davis was getting in the way and the police were frustrated because this is a dude theyre trying to help and hes going all social justice warrior on them.

2266183,0,t3_2l5s0c,Well Kap isnt perfect. He had some mistakes too. On the goalline series the QB bootleg play Kap was running parallel to but away from the goal line. He needs to be pushing toward the endzone for that play to work. By moving toward the endzone he presents a dual threat runpass situation. But it wasnt executed properly by Kap.He also had a couple real close almostINTs early in the game. Illadvised throws and just lucky the Rams didnt hold on to them. But that stopped after the first quarter. sacks given up to a defense that has averaged less than  per game leading up to this. Thats the one stat I keep thinking about.

2276157,0,t1_clsymub,You and everyone else was screaming for a run. Heck the Rams as much as said they were expecting a run by Gore.  You dont think theres value in doing something other than exactly what the defense is expecting and presumably prepared for?  I might point out that less than a month ago with a second and goal from the two against the Rams we tried three running plays in a row... none of which worked so we came away with no points.  I cant really blame Roman for trying something different this time.And as for the fumbled snap... you cant scheme around a potential QBC snap gaffe.  Yeah it screwed up the quarterback sneak but it would have been just as disruptive to just about any other play we called.  Or do you think it would be easier to get the handle on the snap if youre trying to simultaneously turn around and hand the ball to someone else instead of trying to just grab it and bull forward?Ultimately it didnt work.  And thats bad.  And Roman as our OC is certainly partly responsible for that.  But its not nearly as simple as many people on this subreddit seem to think.  Not every play that didnt work was a bad play call.,49ers,clt1vbs,9,t5_2rebv

Look at how harbaugh praises his players today and how he treated them when they won the orange bowl denying an onfield interview after the win and telling the reporter to interview the players. That makes it even more unbeleivable that he bad mouthed sherman and baldwin to NFL scouts.

Containing your opponent to  points or less is a great job end of story.  However there were some key plays where RW was able to scramble and keep the drive going moving out of the pocket to find some TE or RB in the flat or just taking off to snag the first down.  These are key inflection points  that make the difference between being an effective and proficient performance and a truly DOMINANT performance.

Sure Cowboy would be difficult to replace if he chose to hang it up im reasonably confident that a combo of healthy dorseyaldonlynchtank could get us  of his production. talented DEs rarely last past top  anyways so yeah thats a possibility but when it comes down to it the D has spot needs the O desperately needs WRs.Shanahan the Broncos are my nd team and i lived in CO through the late and postalway years. his s The guy has a talent for iding offensive talent  he made near HOFers out of rod smith and ed mccaffery idd brandon marshall and has an affinity for using TEs shannon sharpe tony scheffler he got elway his rings made brian griese a pro bowler calmed down wild man jake plummer before turning to big gunbudding interception machine jay cutler. hes one of the best play callers and midgame adjusters around something we surely lack.... and has a thing for zone blocking schemes if he can make terrell davis a yd rusher just imagine what he will do with a carlos hyde...his s his freaking megalomaniacal ego. after his stint with the Skins where hes clearly the guy responsible for the mcnabb haynesworth and the infamous uncapped salary year disasters i give him  pass for the Great Draft Robbery known as the RG trade cos Midget Dan Snyder greenlit that over his objection to the high price....but he did blow a high pick on Kirk Cousins... hed better be convinced that as a GM hes atrocious.I think Shanny still wants to coach but he MUST know that with a loaded team like this THATS SO CLOSE shelving his ego and stick to coaching and the occasional consult on O talent is his best path forward. He should know that given his rep and history no owner will ever give him a team checkbook again.IF he can do that he would be a great fit for us  and i think he can be had for a harbaughlike myr  and come out another ring or  richer before he retires for good...The  for me is well finally see a modern offense with Shanny  no more of this ironsharpeningiron protege of iron mike ditka schembechler and hayes offense that goes  yds with a cloud of dust....but i digress....Then again the Skins look to be in the market for a coach.

Harbaugh and the ers are expected to part ways after the season. The teams front office will explore whether it can receive compensation for the head coach who has won more than  percent of his games and who has a year remaining on his contract.maioccoBut this offseason figures to be different. Numerous sources close to the situation believe Harbaugh will not be back with the ers next season after serving four years of his original fiveyear contract.you seriously think you know more than them? you think they are just making that shit up? you say oh two players are playing chess right now and then expect me to come up with a quote saying that yeah harbaugh is gone for sure from the FO? what type of FO would ever be that stupid? of course they wont say it because then they lose leverage. they want to see if they can trade him so they can get something out of his last year. its remarkable how someone like you can act so smart and yet know nothing as well. who should people trust though? beat reporters and schefter? or onemanarmy? ,49ers,cn0tbe6,1,t5_2rebv

But if they give him roster control I believe that is a much larger disaster looming. You dont give a players coach roster control. Period. The lack of detachment leads to decision making with the best interest of the player  coach relationship at heart not the long term goals of the franchise. Also hes got to clean up his offensive staff and accept outside help. His offensive staff isnt getting it done and neither is he. But since his ego wouldnt handle that it wont happen so I guess if hes back Im quite disappointed. ,49ers,cn1hd52,12,t5_2rebv

Hopefully his first order of business will be firing Roman and bringing in a new OC.I dont think either Shanahan has anything to offer our team and I think Rex Ryan will end up somewhere that needs help with defense like Atlanta. I dont see McDaniels leaving New England yet but who knows. None of the other names on the list really stand out to me.My main concern is if this mess with Harbaugh is going to prevent us from getting another great head coach. If the front office wouldnt support a head coach that won  games two division titles made three consecutive NFC championship appearances and a Super Bowl appearance then who will they support? Any big name is probably going to want the kind of control Harbaugh wanted and thats obviously a point of contention with York and Baalke.,49ers,cncvfm8,4,t5_2rebv

2898332,0,t3_2tbg8s,he may be picking up some old names but they arent all bad old names.Sparano and Tarver are the big ones and both are fantastic hires IMO. Tarver is a good coach. he may have been in over his head as DC of a weak defense but hes more than qualified to be our LBs coach.Sparano is a home run as TEs coach. you srnt gonna find a more experienced coach to come run a position for you unless youre the cardinals I dislike them bringing back the old Oline coach Chris Foerster but they at least took the effort to get another oline specialist to assist him in Eric Wolford. Who as far as i can tell is a good coach with a lot of experience. That hire makes me think they arent totally sold on Foerster and are covering their asses in case he underperforms.Losing Seely sucks ass but in his one year with the jets our new ST coach improved their kick coverage by a lot. I really cant complain too much with any of the hires so far. as for the remaining positions there are options. Jeff Garcia has been making noise about wanting to be an NFL QBs coach. we could do worse than to give him a shot. another former niner Bryant Young is a good Dline coach and currently looking for a job. even if its only as an assistant having that guy around would be helpful.for OC Chud is still in play and I think of the teams interested our roster is the best fit for his offense. DC and Dbs coach are where I lose confidence a bit. I just dont know who is out there. I think they should look towards the college ranks for that.Yes its a bit of  problem that Tomsula doesnt have the network that most coaches do but thats only a problem this year. If they can go on the field and show that this team can still compete any under performing coaches will be replaced with ease.even just a  season would alleviate many other coaches hesitation of joining our staff. they want to know they arent walking into a dumpster fire. One halfway decent season and we have no problem replacing any coaches we arent sure we want to keep. We still have one of the best rosters in the NFL and that doesnt look like its gonna change.,49ers,cnxjnic,7,t5_2rebv

Also Brandon Thomas moved to tackle but I think he would still be quite familiar with the concepts of combo blocks and getting to the second level to hunt linebackers.And in the case of Kaepernick when the play calls for Kaepernick to pass there is a critical need for the left side of the offensive line to at least guide the penetration so that Kaepernick has a lane to get to his left.

3547816,0,t1_cpw2vgc,gt With Boldin Crabtree and Johnson the ers were suppose to be amazing in the Air. Baalke has shown ineptitude at drafting Wide receivers but the low touchdowns were not his fault. The burden of bad offense is not competely his to bare.I agree that its not completely his fault but of the remaining staff it is more his fault than anyone elses thats currently in employment with the ers.  I also dont believe that anyone outside of a homer really thought that Boldin Crabtree and Johnson would make for a lethal wide receiver corps.  There hasnt been a legitimate vertical threat unless you count Davis in the Baalke era and every one of our receivers is older slower and more on the back nine of their career than at most other teams.  Thats been consistent in his tenure.Its definitely not all his fault but last year we had a very good chance of getting a top flight wide receiver and instead we got a low impact DB in the first.  I dont know how this years draft is in WR but Im sure it wont matter anyway...there were probably a half dozen rookie WR last year that had huge impacts on their teams...and we went ahead and got a safety that we needed to coach to even fit in our system because Baalke had a man crush.,49ers,cpwo9gw,1,t5_2rebv

That said Josh Johnson is a much better QB for that job and would make for a better backup to boot.Pryor also wouldnt beat out Gabbert Gabbert looks good in practice and shit in games.

So perhaps its not so much an issue where elimination comes into the mix simply addition.   After the  season we can look back and maybe ask the users what they think we should addsubtract maybe have a contest where users submit original flair renditions etc. It could be fun. Based on the success of the  season or god forbid the lack thereof we could see a change in the number of Tomsula flairs. ,49ers,cr0q80f,1,t5_2rebv

The post titled Poorly worded at best linked to a screen cap which readgtColin Kaepernick weighs in on Tom Bradys deflated balls It sounds like Kap sits down on Brady. Brady is either so old such that his testicles have lost their structural integrity or has been so sexually active that his testicles are empty of semen.Saying it was poorly worded only suggests that the choice of phrasing implies a level of intimacy between Brady and Kap which does not exist.

4034426,0,t1_crg35z1,Its difficult to explain however you just know it when you see it  and you know Hunter is very productive when healthy which he is and the trait I love about him most is that despite his smaller and more agileshiftyjuke you out of your cleats type of build and style the dude is ALWAYS able to fall forward and end up with those critical extra yards. That doesnt include the way he frustrates defenses as they start to adjust to our premiere back formally Gore probably now the bulldozing Hyde so when we hand it off to Hunter the defense isnt exactly ready for the guy to be so absurdly quick to cut on a dime squeeze in between tackles and somehow make something out of nothing and is rather terrifying for defenses to see him line up in the Pistol as Kaepernick is who they HAVE to make sure doesnt take off....leaving you know who to continue to eat away yards gain st downs and let that clock roll.   Bush is a classic Baalke move. Not as good or even aged as Boldin when we got him but a guy who has had success on different NFL teams and oddly has been a better back the later years of his career.

4126169,0,t3_37rlla,Quite honestly I think we will be fine at RB.  I believe now was the best time for SF to move on from Frank Gore.  They kept him around last year because SF was so close at the time from winning it all and he was also making M plus in salary which probably had something to do with him getting majority carries.  Frank Gore averaged . ypc or less in  games last year and only broke tackles on . of his carries.  Carlos Hyde broke tackles on  of his carries.  Carlos Hyde also scored  rushing TDs same amount as Gore on x fewer carries.  I also noticed on occasions where SF OL created nice holes for Gore to run through but since he became slower LBs and Safeties were able to close it down before he could even clear it.  Carlos Hyde is younger fresher faster stronger and cheaper than Gore at this point.  Having Bush Hunter Davis behind Gore is so valuable because they all have a unique skillset and can take pressure off Hyde.  All those guys are very good in pass pro something Gore excelled at.  One other thing is SF RB coach Tom Rathman who has always been able to get the most out of his guys where ever he has coached.  I really believe that SF stable of RBs is as deep and formidible as ever and is one of the strong suits of SF roster.  Honestly losing Gore isnt a loss in terms of skillset and effectiveness but it could be detrimental in the sense that its a loss of heart and leadership.,49ers,crqlwqv,1,t5_2rebv

All this does is illustrate that some minor details are incorrect and makes it sounds like hes skirting the issue. Its the same schema politicians use to avoid answering a question directly if they dont understandwant to avoid incriminating information. Hes just quibbling. He could have at least said there has been no damage to my car. The closest weve heard was there was no altercation at the actual training camp. He has a history of deliberately misleading the press using similar tactics albeit with injuries so this particular PR approach just bothers me.

Their job is to stop forward progress or force a fair catch basically the punter puts a hand up to signal not to kill him and he wont run.  Most other players are being blocked or have a delayed release they hold with their blocker for  or  seconds then try to break free.  This results in multiple waves of staggered defenders.  It gives the team punting a sort of safety net In the case that the punt returner happens to be an allworld rugby freak of nature.  But I feel like you may start to see more punt team rushing down field and shedding blocks asap to overwhelm Hayne.  It will be interesting to see the NFL adjust.,49ers,cuejh0n,3,t5_2rebv

Draft a lot of Olinemen. Due to the insurgence of spread offenses in college it is harder and harder to find stud olineman. It is one spot I dont mind hitting FA hard for.     Find a project backup QB. Gabbert is nothing but a perennial backup. We need someone to challenge Kap andor take over if Kap fails. I am not one to bench Kap as there are no other better options at this point.    Everything else if fairly moot after those three spots.

In fact Im much less of a supporter of his draft day prowess than I used to be. But in amassing draft PICKS I dont think theres anyone better in the league.Also weve gotten to the Super Bowl under Trent  in that time Seattle has been considered the best team in football so of course theres no way we dont look worse.

Ok all jokes aside his players are still playing hard for him which is good.

5530885,0,t1_cwi6ovx,a learn paragraphs b youre arguing for the sake of argument.  The whole points of the rules of professional responsibility are to require practitioners to do work that rises to the level of a good job for their clients.  While not synonymous with the best possible job imaginable conducting a representation that satisfies all the obligations of the rules of professional conduct is basically a good job.  You have to be prompt and reliable in communicating with your client keep them informed of their options provide legal advice that is correct to the standard of practice manage their money properly etc.  If a lawyer does all of those things they have done something that is in any reasonable reading of the phrase a good job.  If a lawyer fails at any of those obligations they have violated at least one rule of professional conduct and can be sanctioned for it.c youre throwing out a mishmash of terms you dont appear to be fully versed in.  Saying ethics is part of the MPRE is kind of weird.  The MPRE tests a minimal understanding of the rules of professional conduct and is usually taken well in advance of the bar.  So yeah ethics are tested on the MPRE but they also underpin the entire structure of the rules of professional conduct.  Its not like you just pass the MPRE and youre good to go.Tort reform is not a coherent legal doctrine its a political talking point.  it means a lot of different things and the degree to which it has been implemented whatever it is in any particular case varies widely between jurisdictions.  Its not like we now live in the tort reform era and it is suddenly difficult to sue people.I dont know how many public defenders you know but they are widely regarded as among the very best of the criminal defense bar.  Overworked often yes but not experts in criminal law?  Thats clown talk.Your doctor and your insurance company are not the same entity.

Between the concussion saga which is only going to intensify the effect that cord cutting is eventually going to have on the industrys shared broadcast revenue a big part of the reason people cut the cord is the cost of NFL broadcast rights and the stone cold fact that football has likely reached maximum interest level possible while the actual play on the field has decreased I have a hard time seeing how this isnt peak NFL right now.

5575235,0,t1_cwn9nt1,gt Because we dont have a good line now so we need to build it up again over years is a horrible reason to pass up a good QB prospect. Go buy one. Go rent one. Go trade for one. How you get it doesnt matter and you dont need to buy premium talent. I used the Cowboys as an example earlier. Romo is a guy you can build around he makes shit happen and doesnt need his team to be stacked in order to do so. Their FO was comfortable enough in letting him sit behind a shitty OL for a while but they eventually built  a decent team by getting the guy they wanted and building the line afterwards. If we tried to do that with Kap he would be old and useless. The flip side to that though is the Raiders. They went out and made a decent team then finally got lucky enough to land a good QB. The problem with that is that it took  years plus a decade and a shit ton of luck. I think a lot of our fans on here want us to try and build a line and then find a QB. By that time the O line might be too fucking old to even be worth a damn anymore and wed be in the same position again.Ive been awake for far too long now so pardon the lack of coherency.  ,49ers,cwo5r70,1,t5_2rebv

5618526,0,t3_3s21p1,I was very impressed with  today.  Nice runs and good hands catching the ball.Gabbert in the red zone was keeping a cool head which is nice.  And I like the runs he got.  Clearly defenses are not guarding against him running like they were Kap.  I do worry that a better defense would have eaten him for breakfast.  Couple bad throws could have been picks but were not.  And some of his scrambles could have been stripped pretty easily.  But Im ready to go out and buy a Gabby jersey anyway.And also very impressed with  on defense except for that one play where he blew the pass coverage.And I was liking the play calling by and large today.  That TD with the faked run and Celek in end zone.  Going for it on th and making it twice.  Kudos to coaching staff.,49ers,cwtj6iz,14,t5_2rebv

5623966,0,t3_3s3p5r,I dont want Kap to go but the writings on the wall.  Think about all the things that at this point has to go right for Kap to succeed.  He needs an owner and front office that has faith in him. He has to have a good coaching staff in place.  His Oline needs to protect for him.  He needs a good running game to compliment. He needs WR that can stretch the field and catch his throws. etc.. etc... How long do you think itll take for all those things to right itself for the franchise given how lousy our front office and ownership are?   But most important of all.  Kap looks like hes lost his poise and that spells doom for a QB.  Gabbert is certainly not the answer long term as I think teams will figure him out take away the back shoulder throws but hes likely a cheaper stopgap than Kap is which allows us to use Kaps money addressing other areas of need on the roster if were thinking of drafting a franchise passer in this years draft.,49ers,cwu7g48,1,t5_2rebv

She got out at her car and I watched her walk away.  I was alone on the parking shuttle and said to the driver She was very helpful.  Im glad she helped me out.  The driver side eyes me and I wanted to give her props.  I said something again along the lines that she was very professional.  He sideeyed me again and then said Shes a man.  The driver was from somewhere in the Caribbean so I had to parse his words What?  Thats a dude.WTH?On the way to my terminal the driver filled me in.

Overall hes executing the fundamentals of the position significantly better than I thought he would and so much better than his predecessor. If you would have told me a year ago that he would start and the strength he would bring would be his ability to manage the pocket and and pressure I would have probably laughed you out of the subreddit.. but its true. Big thing about him is that hes turning a large number of bad plays e.g. bad design nobody open immediate pressure into positive or break even plays. Thats a huge upgrade for us where before it was just disaster after disaster. Still see happy feet every now and then still see bad throws sailing under pressure every now and then still see bad decisions now and then. Hes better but Im not sure we can call him good yet. However hes good enough to continue to start for us even into next year but so far I dont think hes shown enough ceiling that we should be looking at him as a long term answer at the position. ,49ers,cxqh05v,46,t5_2rebv

6233892,0,t1_cyy7ukg,Okay lets go through that a bitJackson  Character issues were the real reason why he is out. He was also a diva WR and a complete headcase on the field. Wanted to be paid a lot as well. DJax has also missed a ton of games. I dont think the Eagles really missed him that much.Maclin  Very fair the Eagles missed him a lot but he wanted too much money and Chip thought he could make it work with the WRs they had on staff Jordan Matthews was good they felt pretty good about AghalorLesean McCoy  Dude was injured for like half the season and he is one of the  highest paid running backs in the league. I think the Eagles are disappointed his replacement Demarco Murray wasnt as good as advertised but Chip has gotten pretty good production out of the RB position all things considered.  The dude he got back Kiko Alonso was a rising star in the league and if not for the injury this trade would look a lot better. Next question. ,49ers,cyy84wi,12,t5_2rebv

Philly just beats you down and spits you out. Not the best place for a new NFL coach. Well now Chip has  crazy years of experience and a fresh start. I see him as cut from the same cloth as Bill Bellichick. After Reid no one is going to get  years to get it done in Philly. The city wont allow it.

I also think we should target Spence in the first but dont feel were are going to be able to trade back and still grab him when all is said and done.  He had a monstrous week of Senior Bowl practices and his stock is on the rise.All of these moves would give us a ridiculously good front  again which is key in getting this defense back on track to dominance.  The other FA acquisitions Id like to see are for us to grab two interior linemen Stefen Wisniewski C and Ramon Foster G.  Then we should go after Dwayne Allen TE as a buy low candidate.  With our second pick in the draft I think we should trade up into the back end of the first round to take WR Corey Coleman or use our slotted pick for DoctsonBraxton.

So not only is the what changing but also the why the how and the prototype for the right whos. We can make educated guesses at these things from recent history and the almost universal truth that coaching tigers change their hats not their stripes but its still just guessing. In this scenario where we take a tackle with legitimate Top  talent I dont think its crazy that Davis in unknown physical condition might not win a job by default that he hasnt held in a year. Even if he comes back exactly the man that he was and we dont draft a tackle Davis might face a tough battle from Trenton Brown if hes kept in shape and can be more consistent with his zone blocking. I remember Davis as a young rookie. He was worst tackle in all of football bad and almost everyone lined up across from him looked like Von Miller. Brown as a rookie was shutting down guys like Chris Long and Carlos Dunlap.

Also keep in mind that you never know when players will get hurt and teams are always against a salary cap so you always need to be grooming players to be ready for when a tough situation strikes.  When I saw all those players walk in FA and retire last year the redshirt approach proved to be futile and counterproductive.

I do agree with the concept of not overpaying for players but only when times are good. The Patriots for example can be modest in the FA taking good players for bargain prices without risking too much. If we had a HC in his rd year and averaged say  then I wouldnt have a problem with not doing anything in the FA. Its better to build in the draft and inch closer to winning that super bowl. Right now though we are in a difficult spot of rebuilding and revamping our image. We need some success this season to show some signs that the organization isnt as inept as everyone makes them out to be. To do that we need to be doing everything we can to help give Kelly every option we can. That means BOTH draft picks and free agency. After the team has the most options for Kelley to work with we just hope he can deliver. Baalke has made bad moves before. Hes not perfect. But he has made good ones too. I think this will be his proveit year to York. We make a good showing Baalke will stay.

7436690,0,t1_d2n4ajw,I think well be a good amount better this year but you have to factor in four things. Our schedule from the information we have right now looks much tougher than last year.. New system and very different system means growing pains. Gabbert and Kap whoever starts have to learn another system. Blocking scheme is changing from man to zone. Im not sure how much the defense is going to change but I assume there will be some differences. I think Chip Kelly is a great coach but I also think the first half of the season will be pretty rough around the edges.. Looking at pointdifferential and DVOA we were pretty lucky last year to win  games. Realistically we probably should have been a  win team. Yes we got screwed in the Cardinals game but we were gifted the Falcons Bears and Rams wins.. Another big problem we still have which mainly came from losing  contributing players in one offseason is depth. Ignoring talent its really hard to replace  startingrotation level players in just  offseasons. The DLine and Secondary have depth but every other position group on this team is pretty screwed with even a single injury.,49ers,d2ni5bw,1,t5_2rebv

7627123,0,t3_4jh847,As others have said it seems pretty likely that Burbridge will make the roster probably at the expense of Simpson in your version.I also doubt McDonald gets cut. Hes athletic and a good blocker which should actually make him a pretty good fit in Kellys offense even if hes rarely used as a pass catching target. So I think Bell and Anderson are fighting for one spot.Getting rid of Purcell leaves us really thin at nose especially with Williams looking like he wont be healthy at the start of the season. I think he sticks around and we part ways with Dorsey. I like Dorsey but I dont think it makes sense to keep when hed be taking snaps away from young developing players while were rebuilding.Armstrong and Bellore are probably redundant. Theyd be the th and th ILBs both kept around primarily for their special teams abilities. I think in practice we only keep one of them. So I think we only keep one of them and add an extra DB. You have Ward listed as a nickel back. I think they move him to safety this year and we keep Reaser as a nickel back.Then theres the question of Driskel. If Gabbert wins the starting job they have to keep Kap but I think they also want to keep Driskel both as a primary backup so they dont have to risk Kap getting injured and his salary getting guaranteed next year and as a developmental project. I think theyd like him on the psquad but not sure they risk cutting him to get him there.,49ers,d395vl3,2,t5_2rebv

Between Beadles and Garnett we improved overall at guard despite losing Boone in FA given how we went from Devey to Tiller and then Pears took over for Boone when he got injured. As for WR we just dont know what we have with RogersSmelter.  Here is our  WR stat line that one of them needs to outperform  Rec  Tgts  yds  TDs.  That isnt exactly a high bar.

The niners were a bit late to realize our offense sucked while teams like the Seahawks developed and evolved faster despite having less talent in other positions at the time.So yeah our offense as whole was just old school and old... and once harbs tried to change it he got exposed.

If the Niners have someone that has a better chance of making it through waivers they may cut that player and add him to the practice squad.

Picking injured guys with first round talent in latter rounds I know it hasnt worked out more on this next.Hate his draft evaluations Seems to miss the most on draft picks than most NFL GMTeams is decent at picking up OLineman DLineman but beyond that isnt a good evaluator of other positions. This is where his draftstrategy falls apart you can have the greatest plans in the world but if you cant execute them it means nothing.Like his smart freeagency moves Baalke will often let overhyped freeagents sign elsewhere than be tied to an anchor of a contract and would rather use salarycap space to sign depth and free agents who are not too old but still veterans.Dislike his lack of aggressiveness whenever there are surefire skill position players available that the ers have a glaring need for namely CB and WR. The ers have the capspace they should spend it on skill positions!Love his contract moves will often let ers who are a year or two from end of prime walk or overachiever walk because they demanded too much money to resign. Generally resigns players to teamfriendlier deals that dont have huge impacts on the Salary Cap.Overall Grade C I wish we had a better talent evaluator who was a bit more aggressive in free agencybut I do like some of the shrewdness he brings to the table,49ers,d88kdt1,2,t5_2rebv
9125607,0,t1_d88m8cy,gt running the ball and stopping the run is of the past. I dont want to go too far. These things are still important they are just not as important. You can certainly be a Super Bowl contender with just a mediocre run game and run defense if you can either pass the ball or defend the pass at a very high level and I dont think you can make a good argument for the opposite.However once you get into the playoffs you are certain to find other teams who are equally capable of winning the passing game and then a big difference in run game success on either side of the ball can tilt the balance in your favor. Its just a reality that you cant be good at everything under the constraints of the salary cap veteran free agency and available coaching skill and focus. If you have to pick something its more efficient to pick passing or pass defense. You get more bang for the buck. ,49ers,d88qzb7,6,t5_2rebv

Its really too bad that nobody else in the league wanted to trade for our top  QB with that super team friendly deal. gt No a strawman of my point does not equate to ignoring anything. Mediocre Kap shits on Gabbert even when throwing in those games. It is only the one game just like I said that makes Kaps  stats look only marginally better than  Gabbert. Gabberts  stats and play for the matter were clearly better than Kaps. Im honestly not sure what your point is anymore. And I dont really care either because Ive already discussed this topic ad nauseum here.gt I rarely ever base any decision I make on empty thoughts. Kap was top  top  and top  actually by DVOA in  and  respectively.Im sure you have your reasons but the homer visors glued to your face leave you incapable of evaluating his play objectively. And btw Im not denying Kaepernicks effectiveness in  but that doesnt mean Im going to delude myself into thinking he was a top  QB in the NFL. Its pretty easy to look better than you actually are when you play for a top  team that doesnt ask you to do much. ,49ers,d8i8jfi,4,t5_2rebv

It took effort and diligence. Kaps criticism of the system paired with an unwillingness to utilize the democratic process is typical is the millennial generation. I want something but I just want to get it by complaining. Yes he started something and caused so many people to get involved. But his message would have been exponentially more effective if he advocated voting. Instead his message is lets complain but ignore the civic process. If you want change you must persuade. To persuade you must be educated on the situation at hand. If you dont even know how to effect change you cannot persuade.

He might be alright as a Wr if he had unlimited time to train for the new position.No amount of scheme or game planning is going to fix his issues only minimize it. This is the problem with dual athletes who play pitcher and quarterback his throwing motion is too much like throwing a baseball. Most of the time they train to hit a guy standing still which is the opposite of football. They train to throw the ball fast and dont really train for moving accuracy. They train with a fist sized ball instead of a one and half roughly hand sized egg shapeso weird ball ?. That isnt to say dual athletes wouldnt get used to playing football solely but muscle memory is very important in sports. Colins throws in particular is a lot of wasted movement angled weirdly and thrown very fast to make up for accuracy. Pretty much sidearmed. So his chest looks open.Lets compare it to Drew Brees who is known as a good thrower. No wasted movement using his full body to provide push for the ball back leg and opposite non throwing arm stays compact. This is just from an average persons pov.,49ers,dawf96l,6,t5_2rebv

He made some great moves such as drafting Gerald McCoy he also used a st rounder on Josh Freeman which initially looked like a great pick and then Freeman completely fell off the map.

Its the best option that was left after plans A through G failed. They probably wanted both positions to click at the same time hoping that the best candidates would just click. Then if they didnt York would make the call as to which pairing would be best. After McDaniels opted out Kyle was the clear frontrunner by far probably to the point where any other HCGM pairing wouldnt be as good. So they changed tactics and are letting Kyle vote on who he would like as a GM. They probably think like you do in that its not the ideal scenario but its the best with what theyve got to work with.

10657402,1,t1_ddf6usq,Shanahan deserves a lot of blame for calling a step drop on third and one and the stripsack fumble when every peewee coach could see that blitz coming. Absolutely comedic play call it shows  situational awareness. And before you attack me heres Steve Young and Dilfer giving their two cents per KNBR.This is inexcusable said Young. Deep drop thirdand you got the blitz. Everyone knew it. I saw it coming from five seconds before the snap. You cannot hold the football in that situation and allow that.Thirdand Dilfer added. Dont take a sevenstep drop. You just dont do it. Thats what leads to a strip sack.But after that the playcalling at the end was even worse when they got knocked out scoring range. Another costly playcalling error took place with about four minutes left in the fourth quarter. Leading  and needing a field goal to seal the game Ryan was sacked for a yard loss on another slow developing pass play called by Shanahan. A holding penalty followed knocking the Falcons out of field goal range and setting the Patriots up for a game tying drive to send it into overtime.I cant tell you how inexcusable that is Young said. That cannot happen. The ball has got to come out. The playcalling cannot put it into a deep drop. Those are things that lose Super Bowls.And its true its all just sad but true. Look the defense had its faults but Shanahan messed up. Hell grow and he has a very bright mind. But the second half was poor poor football. Also Ryan doesnt have too much freedom with his audibles from what Ive heard. Also your audibles are limited to what the play call says largely in the west coast offense. Youll hear for example  West Right   U bingo cross Z Hook Can it with  wasp onone onone. That means the coach gives you two plays  you go for one or the other but neither is a run  and in a situation where you needed a run Ryan is sort of fucked. ,49ers,ddf89p9,-3,t5_2rebv

11073616,0,t1_den691c,Hes a decent QB. I cant deny that but hes not a QB to lead a team or receive the amount of money hes going to get. He needs everything around him to work to lead a team to a championship. Thats IF he doesnt blow it with his patented worst timing interceptions. To get to his play. If his first read is slightly open hes throwing it and youll be happy with it but anything past that he starts getting antsy in the in the pocket. He doesnt do well with pressure and has a terrible habit of throwing off his back foot into a deadly spot. While having a good completion  he is not accurate at all. Receivers constantly have adjust to passes if not stopping routes for passes behind him. Rarely throws WRs open. Kirk often takes the easy simple pass even when there are shots developing deep that are open. The worst part now comes. He is arguably the weakest mindset for a QB I have ever seen. If he gets rattled early you can pretty much bank on him being off for a while if not the game.Get him a couple receivers a line a run game youll have that with Shanny. Kirks best off PA and a defense and hell win you some games but not a QB I feel can win a ship. ,49ers,den6n8v,7,t5_2rebv

11260804,0,t3_60pvlk,gtVersatility isnt just emphasized in Quinns defense its required. Schofield was expected to be versatile and flexible immediately upon arriving in Seattle. I was running two positions from the first day I got to Seattle and it was just something that  it was kind of difficult at first but once I understood the scheme and the overall picture of what we were trying to accomplish man it became really easy Schofield said. And I think this year I literally rushed  or played every position on the dline from nose to tackle to threetechnique to end you know? And the LEO backer and played a little bit of SAM. So for me Im very very familiar with this defense. I did a lot of studying and its really helped me.gtThe LEO linebacker is a pretty important part of the  under defense. Schofield having played in that position some shared his perspective on that role. I think the LEO backer is basically a hybrid defensive end. You have to be pretty athletic as far as being able to play the sixtechnique pretty strong on the run Schofield said. Its a lot of times where as in blitz packages where youll have to drop in coverage and do some coverage things even in the nickel package and also just be able to pull around in the pass rush because the LEO in the nickel package does a lot of standing up rushing rushing outside rushing inside drops in coverage. So youve got to kind of be the allpurpose football player to play that position.So thats how a player feels about the LEO.That being said I dont know how well Thomas fits that roll if coverage is important. ,49ers,df8e8wa,7,t5_2rebv
11260861,0,t1_df8dqpm,Thats the problem with combine scouting tho  Aaron Donald has some impressive athletic numbers too but would you line him up at LEO and hope he can take the corner against NFL tackles?Lots of guys have impressive numbers but arent any good and plenty of guys with inferior measurables are much better NFL players. The tale is in the tape  and projecting a guy into a completely new position that hes never played or shown to be successful at even lining up against tackles he only wins with a bull rush when he does win isnt wise with the  overall pick. Hes an interior DL  which is a position we dont need. So be it  find someone else instead of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole,49ers,df8eh9r,4,t5_2rebv

11346577,0,t3_61wyr1,Thats why unless there is a clearcut franchise caliber quarterback such as an Andrew Luck the value pick is always the  or shorter quarterback who gets overlooked until the nd round or later.  Thats how to save cap room so you can resign the middle class talent you eventually acquire so that one has a real team.The NFL has basically shown zero ability to develop a big tall guy with a strong arm and nothing else to become a future franchise quarterback.  If a tall guy with a big arm isnt a first round pick theres something really wrong with him thats going to derail his career down the road.  Even Brady though relatively tall was not viewed as having a big arm then or now.  After Brady the surprises on the upside are the  or under guys such as Tony Romo and Russell Wilson.,49ers,dfi44gi,1,t5_2rebv
