6706071,0,t3_478rs9,This is going to sound trite but I actually havent been able to fix any other podcast that I enjoy as much as Thinking Sideways. the interaction between the team is great  a good cross of true crime and history and mystery and legends  and while not everything can be resolved the theories are great and give closure to each episode. Blurry Photos  a little too much stuffing around for my liking and too legendy rather than mysterySword and Scale  a bit grim and overly descriptive   might work better with more than one person Criminal  not in depth enough and not always most interesting issues Lore   good but short and a bit too unresolved and discursive instead of analytical Black Tapes  poor acting really drove me mental ,ThinkingSideways,d0cyrvf,4,t5_37hzw
8037442,0,t3_4pachd,Ive never understood the difficulty people have with Devins voice. I happen to like it.. And cant understand how someone would find her voice irritating in the first place. Its not like shes injecting like every th or th word or driving the conversation into the weeds constantly. She has good cadence speaks intelligently speaks to the point and offers substantive content to the conversation. Of the three Id even say she has offered the most in terms of counterarguments to the others.As for skipping over occasional gory details... Well thats her right just as it is for the listener to not hear it when they do discuss it. And they do. And she does.Think about itIm a grown man seen some shit as well and there are subjects even I would have a hard time talking about in a podcastlike forum. Im sure the same is true for you as well. So why knock her for a choice that we ourselves would also make?Id imagine they discuss in advance when gory details are called for in the discussion and when they arent. To cover it without it being germane to the discussion would be sensationalist.,ThinkingSideways,d4jhf9o,14,t5_37hzw
