5954790,0,t1_cxzaxgt,Im not sure which updates youre referring to exactly.  PVP needs a lot of work but Ive had a few fun instances here and there.  There are a lot of balance problems with turrets and other weapons as its too easy to bypass peoples defenses right now.  Id say this is primarily a PVE game with a lot of potential to have great PVP once more work is done to make it more fair and fun. ,empyriongame,cy07bxu,1,t5_33pyk

8724882,0,t1_d6w61et,I think a lot do and Im guessing its because the game has updates come out pretty frequently. Id assume this will become less frequent as more content comes out to keep us players busy.The server I play on I believe its called The Frontier  Reach seems to be pretty good about not wiping planets like that. I think the best way to cope with losing your progress is to find a good group to play with.,empyriongame,d6w934e,1,t5_33pyk

10224585,0,t3_5mdysu,My opinion is this there are  great games of this genre out right now.  I am eliminating Space Engineers from the discussion I think that game has been surpassed by these  in various ways.  Empyrion is the most minecrafty of all of them.  However they strike a great balance with some combat and survival.  The actual survival mode can be tough at first but once you get the hang of it its fairly simple and the game lends itself to more creativity.  Creativity wise I think Empyrion is either tops or a very close second.  You can build anything the building system is simple easy and straightforward and the devs have been routinely making it better.  Theres multiple planets to explore with enemies on all and plenty to do.  Empyrion offers a great fun survival game but also offers an amazingly creative landscape to build super huge ships and fighters on.  Also has solid Multiplayer servers which are fun although considering the servers wipe every so often I tend to play solo alot.  Second game is Osiris New Dawn.  I have not played this since launch of the alpha and frankly I think there have been a lot fo changes but my impressions early on were it was GREAT.  But different.  This game is not a creative minecraft like game.  Its a pure survival game but the mechanics even from a few months ago were incredibly promising.  Focusing more on action the game has no creative building tools but rather you pick from a menu of options and build with resources you collect on the planet.    Currently I believe there is only  planets and they are fairly limited but the dev team has grown and they seem to be making progress.  From a pure combat perspective Osiris seems to be the tops of the  games im talking about.  The shooting is good enemy AI is actually fairly interesting and well done already.  And the weapons while limited at the moment are cool.  I believe the creator is a deep science nerd so a lot of the game is supposed to be based on actual science theory which gives it an interesting twist.  Basically fun action less focused on building however resource collecting still very important.  Interstellar Rift is the last one excuse the ninja edit i wrote up on Astroneer and then realized i didnt mean that game.  I have the least experience playing this one but at a glance it looks kind of amazing.  Seems to already be a really fleshed out ship building system with a TON of creatvity.  Theres already missions to complete in the game.  I tried the ship builder and its byfar the most interesting one I have used but its also hella complicated right now and I dont even fully know how to build a functioning ship.  So not a ton of info but Id check it out it looks like it could be better than all of the others.  The shipbuilding really is amazing and this is coming from someone who hasnt even figured it out yet.  ,empyriongame,dc30iic,3,t5_33pyk
10360594,0,t1_dci24r8,Well whats odd is that forwarding works fine for my Plex server on  but  wont work. I can connect internally to the Empyrion server and it shows up on the MP list but I cant connect to it via the outside IP.,empyriongame,dcifn6w,1,t5_33pyk
10413357,0,t1_dco9qu7,Its kind of like playing Fallout  and using the console to stock up on ammunition and supplies before every encounter.  It doesnt matter why youre doing it or how capable you consider yourself to be at scavenging...youre still skipping an integral part of the game.Of course its your game on your machine and your time which is why I dont go around labeling people cheaters and following that line of internet tomfoolery.  Nevertheless its extremely disappointing to see new players explaining that they build in creative and import with blueprints because thats what they read they should do.  I personally think they should play the game...the whole game...and then decide later if theyre going to go drain a couple more iron veins or if thats too much of a bore and theyd rather just focus entirely on the build.  Teaching them from the very beginning to bypass a huge part of the game is kind of bullshit.,empyriongame,dcof732,2,t5_33pyk

10913184,0,t1_de5lns4,I kind of agree I think spawning should at least involve some sort of factory block that assembles the vehicle over time even if just as a fuzzy shape of the right proportions instead of some magic factory that exists where? and at the right time delivers the fully built vehicle wherever you want.But I do like the concept of the blueprints besides being able to use other peoples creations once Ive made a vehicle I like I like not having to replicate it from memory. I think just the actual spawning process should be brought into the game world more.,empyriongame,de5m8mc,2,t5_33pyk

11760724,0,t3_67q63i,You have defined SANDBOX perfectly. You hit a wall in this game you hit a wall in  Days to Die you hit a wall in Minecraft you hit a wall in Space Engineers you hit a wall in any sandbox game and thats the real nature of the limit in a sandbox our own imagination. Me I am not all that creative so PVP usually heralds the last few drops to squeeze out of a sandbox. Friendship is probably your best bet but unfortunately space is quite vast and lonely. Whatever you do dont look into the void for too long. The void stares back. ,empyriongame,dgt3vza,7,t5_33pyk
