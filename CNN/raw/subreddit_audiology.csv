1683554,0,t1_cjrdddp,An ENT doctor is a doctor that specializes in ear nose and throat disorders. I would highly recommend going to them over urgicare because  thats all they do. They dont do broken legs or other things which means they have a lot more knowledge of that area. They would be much better than urgicare.,audiology,cjrdi9a,3,t5_2sabh

2034381,0,t1_ckyeqhe,Well my suggestion was going to be to consult an electrophys expert in your area.  We only touched on MLRs in my grad program because they were so new.  But its likely theres a PhD student or researcher looking at MLRrelated stuff who could be of big help to you.,audiology,ckyexma,1,t5_2sabh
2138575,0,t3_2jfao6,I dont have much useful advice although I second what getclaireified says regarding cost. I chose U of Pgh because I was living close to the city and couldnt afford to move away. Clearly math is not my strong suit as I didnt consider the cost of a private instate university. I loved my time there and my education is top notch...but those loans will be calling my name for many years to come. ,audiology,clbnrx2,3,t5_2sabh
2240725,0,t1_clolfml,Welcome to the club. Im an Ed. Aud too! We should start our own subreddit I know you didnt ask for my opinion but here are a few suggestions of mine. My first recommendation would be to join the Educational Audiology Association and sign up for the listserv. Its a huge resource and the cheapest association I belong to. Everyone is very supportive and people are always posting troubleshooting questions so you can learn a lot from the responses. It helps to see if anyone has already figured out how to resolve a problem youre having or if there is no solution to know that youre not the only one out there whos frustrated! Second suggestion is to be on good terms with your manufacturer reps because theyre a big ally when youre having equipment problems that customer service cant help with or have an emergency and need an audioshoe or mic cord ASAP and you dont have time to wait for purchase orders to make their way through your business office. Third suggestion is to expect the unexpected and get comfortable with not knowing all the answers. Just when you think you know everything about how to troubleshoot a specific hearing aid implant processor or FM system the manufacturer will come out with something completely different and youre back to square one. Youre constantly learning and adapting to the latest technology.Last suggestion would be to use surveys like the CHAPS and LIFE when assessing the students need for things like an FM system. When I first started it was easy fall into the trap of thinking Im the professional and know whats best for the student but the kid is the one who has to use the equipment on a daily basis and really should have input on how they think theyre functioning in the classroom. If theyre not on board and dont see value in what youre asking them to do then you just end up at odds which isnt going to benefit anyone. Ive had much more success by working together on ways they think I can help them hear better in class and involving them in the process.,audiology,clone99,3,t5_2sabh

2454823,0,t3_2n08qh,I didnt get asked clinical questions for my externship but I did get that at two places for whenever I looked for a job postexternship. Clinical questions I remember where   Guide me step by step what you would do for an infant hearing evaluation. I made sure I pointed out VRACPA tympanometry difference case history counseling if abnormal results where to refer    How would you do vestibular testing for a patient with a TM perforation? I pointed out reason behind air calorics and would consider rotary chair... how I would not do VEMP because of conductive component etc.    How would you counsel a patient who needs hearing aids when it comes to monaural vs binaural?...  There were another couple of questions but I forgot. It was a group interview and I nailed it. Good luck!  Edit Now lets be real here. This is for an externship so they need to be aware that you still are a student and may not know it all just yet. There really is no right or wrong if there is something you dont know yet you should be able to say that you dont know yet but are hoping to learn more on that subject during your experience there make it sound like the job is already yours.,audiology,cmf49zh,1,t5_2sabh
2634822,0,t3_2pzxuz,Hey buddy! I was in the same boat as you. I really wanted to pursue audiology but the salary made me nervous to switch over. Especially when you take into account the cost of schooling for  years. I eventually did end switching over to speech language pathology to pursue audiology after my bachelors. I think I made the right decision as I have fallen in love with the undergrad audiology course I just finished. Also I hopefully plan on getting aid from one of the armed forces. Its called Health Promotions Loan Repayment Program HPLRP and is offered on and off each year depending on the need. Basically you sign up for a service branch and continue schooling in which they cover all expenses and give you a surplus to spend on living wages while in school. The catch is as soon as you graduate with your degree you serve I believe  years in the armed forces. In my opinion that is a great way to be debt free and looks good on your resume to snag a job at a VA hospital which has some of the highest wages for Audiologists. If the HPLRP isnt offered for you when you enter grad school they also offer th year externships in one of the branches of the military  in which they offset most of your loans and you work with them after for a certain period. Im a dude so the military option seemed pretty cool to me as I like to travel and move around a lot. If you need anymore info on these options send me a message. I have the email of one of the people in charge of the navy aspect of these programs. Sorry for the bad grammar currently typing on my iPhone lol. ,audiology,cn2i6qe,1,t5_2sabh
2666359,0,t1_cn6f6hd,Communication Sciences and Disorders coursework is significantly less strenuous than engineering coursework I will say that much. Thats not to say that it doesnt come with its own share of difficulties and challenges to overcome but I think the biggest difference for me is that I had motivation to want to pursue my degree and graduate school for that matter. That made all the difference in the world.I am sure you will be okay with Biology! There are plenty of ways to navigate memorizing challenging concepts in those classes. I just took Physiology over the summer and I thought I would never make it through the course before I started but it turned out just fine. Once you get into audiology coursework the biology part of it will feel like only a sidenote because of the enthusiasms you will likely develop for the field and the academic part of it as a whole.  I think you will be perfectly fine! ,audiology,cn6m9nq,2,t5_2sabh
3797062,0,t3_33urp5,Audiologist here. If the humming is not a progression of your tinnitus you didnt hear it with earplugs in then it is environmental and you need to find out what is making the sound in your apartmenthouse. If the noise is not being created by your ear or brain there is nothing an audiologist can do for you Im sorry. Edited to add if the sound disappears when you put in earplugs why not sleep with the earplugs in?,audiology,cqp3fr9,5,t5_2sabh

5122257,0,t3_3ki43s,Costco usually requires you to partake in their own comprehensive audiometric testing. Costcos current Phonak hearing aid is based on the Phonak Q which is the previous generation from Phonak. It is a premium instrument missing features are EchoBlock amp Tinnitus Masking not needed for the majority of patients. Just like last years iPhone there are no revolutionary jumps in technology between the Q amp V. You will spend under . for Costcos Phonak Brio vs . elsewhere. I have read that Connect may match Costcos pricing but with their V that is a steal of a deal! That is a price cut of  I wonder why they dont just offer that price to begin with?

6008362,0,t1_cy7614a,Are all of the following uptodate the iOS of the iPhone the TruLink software and the firmware of the hearing aids?Have you reset all of the above? If not try the following close all of the applications that are open double tap the home button and swipe up on any applications running in the background Turn off the iPhone open the hearing aids battery doors wait a minute or so turn on the iPhone close the battery doors and open TruLink. This may not have a huge impact on your issues but Ive experienced some hearing aid communication errors where an interrupted transmission between a transmitting device and the hearing aids got stuck in transmission and created interferencedistortionfeedback etc. Plus these few steps updating and resetting everything is generally where I start with troubleshooting Halos just because more often than not these steps resolve basic issues.Have you had this problem for a while or did it just start all of a sudden? Is it in both hearing aids or just one? Have you had excessive moisture exposure or a drop from a decent height? ,audiology,cy7878o,1,t5_2sabh
