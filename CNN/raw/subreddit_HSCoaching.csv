4798329,0,t1_ctz6709,When coaching arena we do the draft together. You would pull up the draft on a screenshared Skype call and we independently make a mental decision on the choice of class. If we agree on the choice of class we choose that class and continue. If we do not agree we discuss the pros and cons of our opinions. The actual card draft works similarly we each make an initial choice based on card quality and deck synergy and then we deliberate if there is any disagreement.,HSCoaching,ctzd9zs,2,t5_348mr
