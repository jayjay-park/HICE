Ill be making the drive from pittsburgh!  Im ready for the lineup to come out but my expectations are high for it. Do you know if theyll still have a beach stage at this new venue?,Infrasound,d11056f,1,t5_37kop
7427429,0,t1_d2m997m,I prefer to camp next to my car like at forest but leaving your car behind is kind of nice too. It totally detaches you from reality camping out in the woods with no cars. Downfall is not being able to lock stuff up no charging from your car etc. I usually keep my phone on airplane mode all weekend and the battery holds. You more than likely wont get cell service way up there anyways. The no food and alcohol is a mistake. Food and alcohol is encouraged. No glass is the standard and past infrasounds there is no limit on how much booze you can bring. Also there is no security check between the campgrounds and the music so you can literally bring a plastic handle of rum or a  rack of beer to the main stage. That was the old venue but I imagine it being like that this year too. The big thing at infrasound is box wine and slapping the bag. I encourage you to bring a box of wine ditch the box and walk around with a bag of wine. You will meet tons of people and its the preferred drink of the infrafam. Grill and cooler are fine. I bring a mini charcoal grill and a small propane camp grill. There are also some food vendors but I wouldnt rely on them all weekend. Definitely try the deep fried mac and cheese bites tho....so dank. I think you should be fine with your camera. Infrasound is very proart and self expression. I dont see this being an issue. You can even check out the infrasound photography grant if you are interested. The vibes are great and I havent heard of anything being stolen from anyone. Its a very closeknit community. Although Im sure it does happen I dont think its as prevalent as at other festivals. ,Infrasound,d2mg8xr,2,t5_37kop
