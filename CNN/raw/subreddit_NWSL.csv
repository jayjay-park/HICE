1438840,0,t1_ch4pii1,Im personally replying to each of you carbon copy of this note so dont feel special!!! who were kind enough to reply to my original post.Thank you for your advice on postgame Chi Red Stars signatures.  We were lucky enough to attend the Reign game this weekend no pun intended considering the weather that came in.  Obviously I bought my tickets many months ago but I was aghast at how many people were in attendance.  It was great!  My daughter got three to sign her WC jersey and I personally cant wait to see how excited she becomes next year as the cup ramps up.  As an aside the U.S. general populace really doesnt know or appreciate how good the women are on the national stage.Rants aside thank you so much for your advice and helping make our weekend a total blast.  Oh yeah and my daughter got to see the Lady Gaga concert on Friday and we also dipped our toes into Taste expensive taste! for the first time this Sunday morningafternoon.  Thanks again!,NWSL,ciwmvje,1,t5_2vt38

Folks on twitter were also arguing if the real subtext was warning against a partnership between NWSLMLS comparable to the link between mens and womens USL leagues. Also just in general if having mens and womens teams under the same umbrella holds back womens teams in the long run despite helping overcome initial barriers to entry which I think means looking at soccer leagues in other countries or maybe the WNBA.

Anyway...I think its good to have competition in the second division even if its only a regional league in its first year. Thats probably the right idea after seeing the WLeague vanish this year. It seems that the UWS will be trying to fill the WLeagues role as the more Pro league out of the two Proam leagues in the WoSo second division.

6632727,0,t1_d056jqk,In addition to what Anony said Solo underperforms with us. I mean sort of. Shes still a better keeper than a lot of teams have for starters without a shadow of a doubt. But Kop frequently has better stats than Solo for us. Solo still looks good but she doesnt look like the god tier womens keeper that her reputationuswnt performance entails. Some Reign fans want to keep Kop because of how big of an asset she is with us. When Solo retires maaaybe after these Olympics? most hope that Kop will become our new . At the same time shes so good  I think were all dreadexpecting the day when we hear Kop gets traded. The Reign could likely get quite a lot of something in return especially with a few teams hurting for Keepers this year. SkyBlue for example. Kop could get to be a true starter rather than a backup which obviously shed probably want from a professional development perspective.Harvey could go full crazy though and let Kop compete Solo out of her position but thats pretty unthinkable even for Harvey. ,NWSL,d05dqkd,3,t5_2vt38

I wonder if well see a pattern of tortoise vs hare emerge where some people consistently do above average and then others do amazing some weeks but flop others and maybe the two will equal out in the end.

11522218,0,t3_64fuj6,Is this really a big deal? There are a limited number of weekend hours to play soccer games.  Clicking on the link gives a bunch of MLS games broadcast on local TV and stations nobody gets like UniMas.  There are only a handful of times that MLS is on ESPN at the same time NWSL is on Lifetime which are the games I would expect would actually impact NWSL viewership.,NWSL,dg21n0t,7,t5_2vt38

I think she could have helped the seemingly flat and compact offense. Hopefully Marta can bring some spunk up top. Spencer worked so hard up top but she didnt really have anyone to work off of in the first. ,NWSL,dgbhz35,4,t5_2vt38
11606305,0,t1_dgbjeva,I get that. To be fair though Go does work with Chromecast and Apple AirPlay so you can use it to watch on the TV. They arent built in apps but there is a way to watch the games on a TV. I do agree that YouTube was easier to use and that Go better expand their base but you gotta weigh the entity of pros and cons. And for the league right now getting some investment and a product that does work right now even if it isnt as accessible was worth the deal.,NWSL,dgbl1st,4,t5_2vt38
