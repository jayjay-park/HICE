241255,0,t3_1wtxcy,As you apply pressure to turn the key move the handle bars back and forward from full lock about an inch or so until it starts to turn then apply pressure inwards towards the stem as it starts to turn. If the key is a cut one or something you may need to jiggle it Google lock rakeing I think thats how you spell it but you apply small pressure as you basically fuck the keyhole while turning sorry if that doesnt make any sence.

812880,0,t1_cgwmaw9,The body position on a duke is very similar to a SM. The main difference is clearance. The duke sits lower than a SM and has less suspension travel making it pretty much limited to thrashing paved roads only. The seat is also very different. The duke gives you a nice comfortable seat that keeps you from moving around which unfortunately is not much good for offroad. I love the Duke but you probably want a real SM. The duke isnt pussified just intended for a different purpose.,supermoto,cgwofp6,2,t5_2rkmy

1124752,0,t3_26zxes, USD? k km is  miles if anyone is curious. In my area SF Bay Area the DRZ is a very popular bike and  for an unabused SM would be a fair price. Do your research. Make sure the owner knows the DRZ and that he took care of it properly. Things to check loose countershaft sprocket nut?  Steering stem and swing arm bearings greased and tight? Does it have a manual cam chain tensioner? Engine case savers? Or any sign of JB weld on the engine case. Correct jetting? Good looking x mod or does it look like it was hacked out with a chisel and Swiss Army knife?And of course the usual for any bike chain sprockets tires brake pads air filter scraped foot pegs check and ask about oil change routine and valve check history. Any signs of neglect or confusion could be red flags to continue your bike search. But then again in my experience its hard to find an absolutely perfect used bike.,supermoto,chw569a,3,t5_2rkmy

3707499,0,t1_cqesnmo,Yeah its good for the dunes and that sort of open area thing but Ive had a hard time getting it to go fast on the technical stuff. Depends on what your mates are riding if theyre all on DRKLRs then go for it as its pretty nice slow and challenging riding. But if theyre on proper trail bikes theres no way youll be keeping up with them easily  the DR is just too heavy for that sort of thing. It really depends on your riding style and the trail youre riding  Im a more aggressive rider keeping the bikes up in the rev range and I havent found it that inspiring in the dirt. However Ive lent it to my father who has made it go through some tight single track stuff much better than I ever could.

4339276,0,t3_3ansjs,Just to clarify a few things.  These are dirtbikes with street wheels. The aerodynamics seating position and the whole bike in general are not made to run at highway speeds. Almost all sumos can run at highway speeds but they lack the power and seating position to make it comfortable.  My Sumo experience is with a DRZ.  In stock form itll do  but itll take a bit to get there. And you really dont have much throttle left for passing. With a pipe and FCR carb  is much quicker to get to but again not much left to pass compared to a cc sport bike.  You cant downshift at that speed itll redline. DRZ only has  gears. Stock gearing gives the best top speed vs RPMs.  Changing the gearing just messes with your city riding.   Top speed suffers regardless of what you do.    Short story These are dirtbikes. If you need to do  the DRZ can do it but there isnt much left. Top speed is .,supermoto,cserli8,2,t5_2rkmy

If you insist on lowering it the best way would be to have the suspension lowered internally by a professional but thats going to be  if possible at all. If you wanted to go the cheaper route you could see if they make a lowering link for the rear shock and raise your forks in the triple clamps a little bit.

The hose if it is a crash at a substantial speed will start to wear away and has a high likelihood to tear. Then you have a hole in the hose and it is literally half as effective.

9414134,0,t3_59kt5i,As a diehard jap fanboy Id buy the KTM all day long.The WR is a tarted up commuter the KTM is a fucking racebike.Depends on what you want from your bike though. If you dont have any other bikes and need the supermoto to commute on every day maybe you should consider the WR. If you have something else to commute on and you dont mind getting your hands dirty occasionally or paying someone else to sort your shit out the KTM will be at least  times more fun. The WR is heavier and slower but undoubtedly more reliable. The KTM is lightweight and fast as fuck. Hope it doesnt explode and HOON LIKE FUCK.Or like... wait a bit and see if something fun and reliable comes up... not that the WR wont be any fun at all.Look for a WR maybe a WRF or something like an XRR as long as you have the legs to kick start. Its probably better to hang on to your money until you find the right bike thats probably the smart decision but if you just wanna hoon right now Id go KTM.,supermoto,d99b2km,4,t5_2rkmy

10159251,0,t1_dbuupo1,The LC was used in the duke but it wasnt designed for it. AFAIK the LC was first used in the   Enduro and was kick start only. The duke wasnt made until . The duke is a street bike with a big dirt bike engine.And just because smaller bikes are better suited for kart tracks and MX doesnt make the  SMC barely a supermoto.,supermoto,dbvlvuz,1,t5_2rkmy

10345323,0,t1_dcgp6cj,Like if you have a weight goal of lbs in a year or something maybe springing the bike for that would be a good idea. I dunno how fast youre dropping weight but I know being on too stiff of a bike sucks and too soft isnt ideal as well.,supermoto,dcgp9cf,2,t5_2rkmy

11243101,0,t1_df62m9w,Its just kinda limiting if you want a backlit speedometer  computer offroad lights etc. its usually night time riding that drains the battery quickly when you have all your lights on. The Crf might have a stronger stock stator than the WR,supermoto,df6e0e2,1,t5_2rkmy
