3890257,0,t1_cqznn3b,I try not to post gunmishaps or DGUs that depend upon a suspect claims it was an accidentDGU as the only supporting evidence.  If you think Im posting onesided gunmishaps andor DGUs then by all means call me on it.Keep in mind nothing that we post is decided until a court of law decides the outcome or a prosecutor decides not to prosecute.  Unfortunately the press isnt biting at the bit to post these types of stories because it just doesnt have the wow factor that a shooting has. So yeah sometimes I call them wrong.  And when I do I go back and delete them.,gunmishaps,cqzq1sk,1,t5_2yzka
