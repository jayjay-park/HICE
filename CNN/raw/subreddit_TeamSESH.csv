5560068,0,t3_3r9xku,I got mine flipped a dick because USPS sent it to the wrong house. I looked on my tracker and it said delivered but there was nothing there so I started freaking out and yelling thinking it got stolen. I bought the last bomber so I was hoping nothing would get messed up on the order and at the time I thought it had. Knowing USPS I just waited and the person it got delivered to just gave it back which was cool of them.Its certainly more puffy than I thought itd be but that would explain one thing its EXTREMELY insulating. If any of you live in cold climates and youre waiting on it this thing is for sure a winter jacket. I live in SoCal on the coast but I still wear it and its not too bad. The work done on the Greaf patch is absolutely unreal knowing it was sewn on by hand I understand why it took a month to get to me. I sent  emails to the merch chick to get updates which was worrying. Im glad i have it though this jacket was actually well worth the money. ,TeamSESH,cwm9zua,3,t5_2zxam

Sesh is life I used to say to myself. Yung Lean hears me and calls me a faggot. I knew he was just jealous of my devotion to SESH. I called him a cunt. He slaps me and sends me to go sleep. Im crying now and my face hurts. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its Bones I am so happy. He whispers in my ear  yo you got a plug for my ZUNE? He grabs me with his powerful pasty white hands and puts me on my hands and knees. Im ready. I want to please Bones. I spread my asscheeks for Bones. He penetrates my butthole. It hurts so much but Id do it for Bones. I can fee my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his love. Yung Lean walks in. Bones looks him straight in the eye and said  they say they know me but they dont know Elmo. Bones leaves through the window. Bones is love Bones is life.,TeamSESH,dakreku,8,t5_2zxam
