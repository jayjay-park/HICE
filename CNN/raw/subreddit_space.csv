It was solved by wrapping the user in coolant tubes and circulating cold water.If you have a bigger spacecraft or maybe today big EVA suits then the body heat will not be enough to counteract the black body radiation and you need heaters.

13688,0,t1_cefxkt5,You dont need the kind of propulsion systems described in science fiction to do meaningful exploration.  What NASA actually researches in terms of advanced propulsion is things like solar sails highpower electric propulsion systems and fusion rockets.  Theyre things that we can build a prototype or proofofconcept demonstration for unlike warp drives which are still firmly in the realm of theoretical physics. Incidentally the process of taking the theoretical to the proofofconcept is the increase in esoteric knowledge you so casually dismiss.  Science isnt about doing things which are immediately profitable thats the job for business people but about expanding our knowledge base and applying it to create new technology.To elaborate on this I give you Brian Cox.

25428,0,t1_ceh97cn,The thing about gravity assists is that the object doesnt actually get its velocity from falling into the gravity well of the object thats giving it the assist per se.Gravity in this sense is just sort of a sticky force that causes the asteroid or in this case the third stage of a Saturn V to catch up to the moon and siphon off some of its velocity.  Of course the moon is much more massive than the stage and since momentum is conserved the moon doesnt slow down much.  The stage on the other hand gets a huge speed boost.In a sense its like bouncing a tennis ball off of a moving car the added speed that the ball bounces back with really comes from the momentum of the car and the compressive force that the ball experiences as it hits the car and expands again is just a way for that momentum to transfer over to the ball. ,space,cehbsye,2,t5_2qh87

You have to remember that its over a billion people that the government has to take care of so poverty can never be completely eliminated. India spends less than . of its GDP on ISRO. The space agency provides a lot of data that is used in communications and remote sensing. Indian farmers are direct beneficiaries of ISRO. A couple of months ago a major hurricane hit the east coast. Usually this would mean millions of people dead but because of satellite data the government carried out a large evacuation away from the coast and not many people lost thier lives.

If you want to do a one way trip then Venus is easier.But for me the big thing is that Mars you would almost certainly contaminate beyond recovery in an irreversible way with Earth life. Which we shouldnt do at least not for a while yet as we have had no chance yet to study it thoroughly in its pristine state. It may have amazing secrets of past and present life. That we have found nothing yet is not at all surprising because surface conditions apparently destroy organics and the cosmic radiation would also destroy life over the billions of years  and we havent sent anything sensitive enough anyway  Viking last mission to attempt to detect life. We probably need to dig up to  meters deep and in the right place also to find good evidence of past life on Mars.Also though there may be present day life on Mars also it is likely to be sparse in a few places maybe the warm seasonal flows.

Mars direct was a response to what happens when we let NASA go hog wild they conjured up a  Billion in  dollars mars mission called SEI with battlestar galactica scale starships that was designed more to showcase each NASA centers political projects rather than following best engineering practices and engineering the mission around the engineering goals. Speaking of whichgt NASA redesigned the missions to satisfy their requirements in terms of crew size margin entry descent and landing systems and safety. What they got were the Design Reference Missions with DRM . requiring three  ton launchers and DRM . requiring six  ton launches all with nuclear thermal propulsion.After the spectacular failure of SEI in congress there was a push to implement Mars Direct and JPL flat out refused because it didnt include nuclear propulsion that is not that you need nuclear propulsion but rather theyve been working on it all these years for a potential Manned Mars Mission and theyll be damned if we launch one without it.NASAs bureaucracy is famous for this. Look at the design of the space Shuttle the SRBs and Morton Thoikol designed to be sourced from Utah its design limitations were dictated by the train tunnel dimensions it would have to pass through on the way to Florida Look at the XVenturestar program designed to showcase composite material and SSTO more rather than actually be cheap... NASA is always putting the cart before the horse.Edit Oh and lets not forget ISS. Part of the rationale for the space shuttle was the be able to build a space station so ISS originally Space Station Freedom under Reagan was to be that space station. Never mind the Russians proved you didnt need such a damn expensive and inefficient launcher as the shuttle to build it when they built Mir. And lets not forget the fact that the only reason ISS went international was to tie other nations into the project so that congress would not cut funding for fear of damaging international relations. Any large high profile NASA mission goes this way a Mars mission is no different. The DRMs are going this way too. NASA is a political organization so its got politics.gt A redesign of the plan by Zubrin published later required a  metric ton launcherYou dont mention what prompted the redesign or which one you are talking about. Different mission goals prompt different requirements. Zubrin also redesigned it around falcon heavy. gt The plan gives the crew a very tight living space little science equipment etc. Thats the idea...gt He also had some very optimistic estimates regarding entry descent and landing. Basically if his plan was followed as he proposed it the crew would probably smack into the ground at terminal velocity or burn up.I would like to see a citation for that one. gt The general architecture is simply too optimistic to work with two launches and without a huge launcher. NASA redesigned the missions to satisfy their requirements in terms of crew size margin entry descent and landing systems and safety.NASA redesigns missions to satisfy political requirements and claims they are related to crew size margin safety etc... when these are in fact posthoc rationalizations. Lets not forget when engineers told NASA administrators that based on overall design complexity the shuttle would have a  in  catastrophic failure rate and they pencil whipped that to be  in .   gt TLDR Mars Directs estimates are too optimistic to realistically work.Mars Directs estimates and requirements are in line with its limited goals however politics are a real consideration and Mars Directs politics are not realistic. ,space,ceud4hx,5,t5_2qh87

At Phobos you set up another extraction plant and supply propellant to land on Mars.Each step serves as a beachhead for further development.  The main reasons for starting with Near Earth Asteroids are  some of them are wet contain a lot of bound water in their minerals and  deltaV to reach many of them is lower than to the Moons surface and can be done with electric thrusters.Starting with Near Earth Asteroids in no way means only Near Earth Asteroids they are literal stepping stones to other destinations.gt  are much further from being flightreadyThats more due to the pitiful investment in local resources than lack of understanding the methods needed.  Water extraction from asteroid minerals merely requires heating to C then condensing the vapor.  Extracting oxygen from Lunar rocks is harder because they are dry.  They contain very little chemically bound water with the exception of cold traps in a few special locations.,space,cf52xon,2,t5_2qh87

At some point we will probably have settlements on the moon Mars in the asteroid belt and at Lagrange points.  Whatever we do now sets the precedent for how those areas are managed who or what corporations own them and will have enormous repercussions for future off planet living industry and development.Its already complicated as international treaties prevent any country from claiming territory off of Earth.  That being the case we are primed for a landresource grab by nongovernmental bodies which means corporations.

It is hard to have any really complex parts come back down safe. Ocean landings mean salt water which means corrosion.

249213,0,t1_cf6i5sj,Hah.SpaceX has some of the most competitive products in a multibillion dollar a year industry orbital launch and services. They can easily build up operating budgets of several billion dollars for their own projects over the course of a few years. And with their technological acumen they have the capability to build a vehicle which could deliver cargo to Mars at costs comparable to what it costs now to put payloads into low Earth orbit.With that they could run their own Mars mission if they decided to. The idea that it costs tens of billions of dollars or hundreds of billions of dollars to do manned spaceflight comes from bloated government programs that had no cost consciousness whatsoever and were skirting the bleeding edge of technological capabilities. SpaceX thinks they can offer reusable Falcon  v. launches for as little as  million. With more capable launchers designed specifically for even greater reusability and taking advantage of SpaceXs continuing growth of experience in building and launching such vehicles who knows what they could achieve with the MCT?,space,cf6l2h8,21,t5_2qh87

257087,0,t1_cf6sj2r,No and thats actually the good part. The vast majority of the cost of orbital rocketry and spaceflight is systems engineering manufacturing and operational overhead. And those aspects are subject to many varieties of efficiencies and improvements. Historically launch vehicle development and operations has been hugely inefficient as it occurred through the auspices of government bureaucracies and typical government procurement programs. These sorts of programs had almost no cost consciousness whatsoever and were very little concerned about competition in the commercial marketplace.During the th century one of the only entities to develop rockets for the commercial market specifically was Arianespace the Ariane  and that only due to the extreme costs and limitations of the Shuttle. But a government developed vehicle designed to be cheaper and more capable than one of the most expensive launch vehicles in history was just a baby step compared to what is technologically possible. Only recently have fully commercially developed vehicles designed specifically for competition in the launch market been created from SpaceX and Orbital Sciences and they have been able to realize significant economies compared to historical models of development.What SpaceX has done with the Falcon  is to design with cost effectiveness and reliability which affects cost effectiveness in mind. The Falcon  is in many regards very simple perhaps even elegant. Its a decades old design that has been streamlined and improved. Thats a big reason why SpaceXs costs are so low they dont fall into the trap of being enthralled by high tech improvements like advanced propellants LOXLH and suchlike they rely on pragmatic engineering through and through. The RCS system for the first stage just uses cold gas thrusters for example an extremely lowtech solution that reduces the performance of the stage a bit. But small performance reductions here and there are easily made up for by the vast cost reductions overall. Its this sort of engineering which enables SpaceX to develop reusability and get a big benefit from it. Since the Falcon  is simple most of the cost is in the st stage not the upper stages as in other vehicles. Because SpaceX has control over the manufacturing of every component of the Falcon  it is easier for them to modify the first stage for reusability and to get a huge benefit from doing so whereas with competing rockets it would take a huge cost and yield marginal results.Moreover SpaceX is capable of doing iterative development of their systems to a degree that their competition isnt. They can transition from the Falcon  to the F v. they can introduce reusability to the F v. first stage they can start with an unmanned orbital capsules and iterate the design towards a manned version and so on. Its that sort of engineering which enables discovery of more efficient designs further operational improvements and so on.,space,cf7eiuz,1,t5_2qh87

262106,0,t1_cf770ty,My understanding is that the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light.Consider an elliptical orbit. As you move from the apoapsis high point to periapsis low point you speed up. Arcing back up you slow down losing the speed you built on the fall inward and trading it for energy to keep going until you get back to the apoapsis.However if that periapsis is inside the event horizon of a black hole things get hairy. Black holes have tons of gravity so an object can fall in really really fast. However because the gravity is so strong once an object or photon is inside the speed needed to coast back out actually exceeds the speed of light. That brings up other questions namely what happens to all of that energy if the photon cant convert it into speed but thats beyond me.,space,cf7xcss,1,t5_2qh87

The key is timing. In almost any orientation of orbits a moon that is large enough to be detected spectroscopically also is large enough to move the host planet in its orbit and the small variations in transit times give away the Moons presence.Once the moon is detected one just has to look at time slices of the spectra to see if it is always the same or if it is bimodal sometimes appearing to have some elements and sometimes missing those elements. That would give you separate readings for the composition of the planets atmosphere and for the surface of the Moon plus the planet.

That puts them far beyond Russia as well on the technological scale especially in the area of flight control and avionics. They just dont have the long operational history of the Soyuz program. Also the Dragon crew mockups make Soyuz look pretty steampunk.The Merlin is not the most sophisticated engine flying as its gas generator cycle but it performs incredibly well and seems quite reliable. Raptor will be more up to the state of the art in terms of combustion cycle and will outperform just about anything flying except hydrogen which it isnt using for costbenefit analysis reasons. Hydrogen will always outperform methane on isp because physics but its overall more costly to run hydrogen due to operational expense according to SpaceXs analysis than to just build a somewhat larger methane rocket to get the same lift capacity. Theyre probably right.None of those s rockets would be human rated today. The safety standards for a manned launch are far far higher. Back then space flight was barnstorming test pilot stuff.

We currently only know that they suck up matter emit no color have an event horizon if you pass this then even light cant escape the black hole this means that if you go past this no radio signals can escape and you also wouldnt be seen.. Because black holes have so much mass my theory is it slows down time so much that nothing will ever reach the center think of the arrow paradox. So yeah theyre pretty creepy and interesting. Even though they are extremely condensed matter they still remain stable not expanding so they may hold some sort of unknown energy that we could harvest.TLDR Black holes are either the good guys or bad guys of the universe.

It would cost too much to renovate for SLS besides like you said Stennis is the new primary test facility. Also Marshall is harder to get to and NASA like to ship their rockets by barges. Since Stennis is closer to the gulf it makes transport a lot cheaper and easier given that the rockets are being assembled in Louisiana and only need to cross over a little bit of water to get to Mississippi.The launch pads at Kennedy already have rust and are in bad shape after only a few years and theyre currently restoringupgrading them for the SLS program.

There is great value to the NASA approach though for this reasonIn science and engineering knowing what specific questions to ask is just as important as getting answers. Creating sustainable food sources for long term spaceflight asks a wide variety of very specific daunting questions about agriculture that are in search of answers.

If the air somehow did not rotate with the rotating walls you would be correct but that is where we disagree.  Your statement that the air will not rotate is akin to claiming that the interior of the spacecraft will be made of magical material with zero drag.  Impossible.  Near the skin of the walls a boundary layer of air will form where the velocity of the air with respect to the skin is zero i.e. it rotates with the skin.

But given the densities of available materials the best choice at low light intensities is a MagnesiumAluminum alloy with a reflectivity around .  That alloy has the best ratio of mass to reflectivity.At high light intensities the best material is Tungsten foil because anything else will melt.  Counterintuitively if you are leaving the Solar System you want to start as close to the Sun as possible and get the most kick from the very high light intensity.There are speculative materials using carbon nanotubes with a very thin reflective layer where most of the sail is holes.  That still reflects well if the holes are much smaller than the wavelength of light.  But we are not very far along in making that kind of sail material much less opening it.gt So in other terms that would be a free DeltaV of  per day?Yes in meters per second.  Carrying a payload or heavier sails would get less velocity proportionally.gt This . the lightness ratio is comparable to the Trust to Weight ratio ?

1506963,0,t3_2beyvt,As an aspiring Astrobiologist this has always been a fascinating question to me. Especially since it essentially boils down to where is everyone? as the Fermi paradox puts it. In my personal opinion I believe that the early stages of evolution are the easy ones to go through. The wikipedia article on the Great Filter give a reasonably good summary on the  main stages of lifeConsidering how quickly life on Earth arose and recovered after extinction events it can hypothesized that it is easier for simpler or smaller life forms to proliferate and evolve than it is for largersmarter ones. For example Earth went from unicellular simple life to landdwelling complexmulticellular life forms fairly quickly. However it took hundreds of millions of years for intelligent life e.g. humans to evolve. This means those later stages e.g.  may be the rare ones therefore life in other parts of the galaxy or universe will not have reached the level of development that we have.I personally feel that resource consumption may be the big road block to colonization of the galaxy. Considering how far apart everything is and the average lifespan of all living things is utterly minuscule on a cosmic scale it would take enormous amounts of energy to travel from one place to another even using nuclear powered engines or particle acceleratordriven ships. The amount of energy needed to get from place to place in the galaxy as well as the sheer amount of time it would take to get places even if you are travelling at light speeds may very well be the reason we havent observed any civilizations or signs of intelligent life anywhere in our cosmic neighbourhood.Of course this may all be moot speculation since it is similar to the German Tank Problem. We only have n as our data set that is human beings are the only known intelligent civilization in the galaxy thus far. It is difficult to speculate on the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere since we only know of one instance where it arose.Also check out Tardigrades if you havent heard of them though Im sure most of you have.

1658660,0,t3_2dbxjk,I have a couple questions about the warp drive theory. Because the space outside of the warp bubble is warped around the bubble would that mean that any matter in the way of the bubble would just be warped around the bubble as well? The matter would just continue to occupy the same piece of space and move with that piece of space. This would mean  that a ship with warp drive could fly straight through solid objects because the object would just be warped around the ship. The object would also not be affected because as the ship passes the space would then resume its previous shape and as far as the object is  concerned nothing ever happened  because it never moved through space and therefore wouldnt notice. This would also mean that the ship would be invisible because any light would be warped around the ship as well.My other question is if the warp drive works by transporting a bubble of space what happens to the spot where that bubble of space used to be and what happens to the space that is displaced by the bubble when the warp drive is turned off?,space,cjo8jis,9,t5_2qh87

At the time of the discovery Pluto most definitely qualified as a planet given the definition at the time.I disagree with this actually. Pluto was discovered significantly after Ceres and several others were downgraded from planets but we didnt know Charon or the Kuiper belt was there so we were inaccurate in our original assessment of Pluto. That original data set classified it as a planet yes but in context of Charon and the Kuiper belt Pluto likely would never have been named a planet in the first place. You must remember that Pluto being a planet was largely a hold over from before Charon was discovered and it was thought to be significantly larger than it really was. ,space,cjukd7s,8,t5_2qh87

Just because that bit is part of a bigger memory location or part of an instruction doesnt make it any less justifiable to say that a single bit was flipped.  Very often memory mapped IO such as simple sensors will map to just a single bit but then be read as a byte or word.  Besides you are also assuming this is some sort of CPU not an ASIC or FPGA which means a single bit most certainly could be operated on.Just like a compsci to round up bits to words That being said I dont know exactly what happened but I doubt there was just one sensor or just one nonredunant calculation to trigger the autodestruct so it probably wasnt just one bit as others have said.  At some point though the trigger to the actual selfdestruct detonator probable is a single signal analog or digital which basically would be a single bit flip heh.

You could literally replace UK with The Netherlands or Kyrgyzstan and the plan wouldnt change a lot.In my opinion the main driver of a UK space program would be stimulating a spaceflight industry in the country itself to foster technological innovation a healthy industrial base and prestige at home. This is why France and Germany invest so much in ESA and Ariane and I doubt the UK would do it differently.

The goal is to have a reliable domestic space launch capacity.  By funding two developers they have a higher probability of at least one working reliably.  Even if they both start out working OK past history Space Shuttle Apollo  shows you can have problems.  If one of them has a failure and needs time to fix it the other serves as backup.Even on cost having two suppliers means you can force them to improve if they want to stay in the business.

1992907,0,t1_ckszsx1,I dont get why? The space shuttle was a horrible failure of design and management. Its rather embarassing that we left our original superior models using Saturn rockets and went for a reusable design that was mostly not reusable. Remember we scrapped it because it was literally too dangerous to fly. Its a failure. The larger rockets will be that much more impressive if they functional reliably. The Russia luaunch platform is embrassingly much more reliable than anything the US has tested so far. In the end the Space Shuttle was a giant pork spending project that was flawed from the start and people said it was and the government had no choice but to continue with it or admit failure. The result is billions wasted and lives lost. Thats nothing to be proud of. It was a nice try but it was clear it had failed years ago and was not safe and NASA covered it up. It was also clear it was not a cheaper launch platform which was supposed to be the main reason we built it. We do still have the military space shuttle but its probably nothing more than a giant waste of money as well.

2065557,0,t1_cl27gd7,Not always true. Even limiting yourself to a g pitch maneuver back toward the Cape to limit stress on the draining and thus weakening ET so long as you initiated the maneuver within a few seconds of SRB sep I often had extra fuel and thus energy when flying an RTLS in Orbiter. Unless the maneuver happened late unlikely as other abort modes like TAL crop in fairly soon energy isnt necessarily a problem. I think the bigger risk is in setting up an approach to land that doesnt needlessly endanger people on land. So they would be more likely to get enough energy to crash off the coast safely then put it in a bestrange glide slope and start bailing out at a safe altitude.Running RTLSs in Orbiter was basically a major pasttime for me for years. I got pretty good and bring it back into the pattern and landing at the SLF. But risking that in a simulator and doing it real life are two completely different things. Also Orbiters Shuttle flight model is subpar nearing stall conditions but is otherwise not too bad. I certainly used the term glide slope loosely. The RTLS was all about picking up speed and keeping your VVI positive. Those strip gauges of vertical velocity and accelerations are invaluable at saving energy and telling you where to point the nose.,space,cl2dm0q,1,t5_2qh87

2237347,0,t1_clo1lrn,No those are good.  They are specifically engineered to be unlike a grain of sand in that the ratio of their cross section to mass is quite high!  They can be made from a super reflective material that can be made quite thin like highly polished beryllium foil or aluminum foil.  The particles of solar radiation will impart momentum to the sail as they are reflected back at the sun.  The amount of energy will drop off as an inverse square  so there wont be much acceleration between star systems  but as a means to get to another planet in our solar system it is a really viable option.  Rockets suck for this because they require fuel.  For long burns associated with very high acceleration they require a lot of fuel.  The fuel itself quickly becomes the most massive part of the spaceship compare the fuel tank on the old space shuttles with the shuttle itself.  Solar sails allow for steady prolonged acceleration without any fuel.   They are rad.  tldr You will totally coast around in your solar sail ship one day.  ,space,clo7y75,2,t5_2qh87

Its now stopped slanted some cams are shooting the sky other the ground and other nearby rocks as seen on the first photo. Its inside some kind of hole not much sun for the solar panels. EDIT It landed on the core of the comet it sees the light from the sun for about  to  hours per day. In the next daysweek the angle of the comet will change relative to the sun and it very likely the solar panel will get more sunlight so more power for the probe.EDIT  Many labs are performing right now and performed the whole night. For now they put the drilling on hold since they dont know if its tied to the ground or not. Drilling op is also power hungry so its kinda a good thing its on hold since theres not much sun available for the panels. Battery life been reestimated to hours due to the lack of sunlight. This includes the  hours of descent.They are constantly adjusting missions goals depending on conditions power available etc EDIT  The probe has been working to gather scientifict data the whole time including during the bounces. Theres already a large amount of data available whatever happens next.EDIT  Its resting on hard ground with a layer of dust about cm and thats good news because it allows measurements to proceed as planned. As in its not burried into soft soil.EDIT  Solar panels are deployed radio link is up and running but the fact the probe is slantedin a holerandom ground limits the time it can communicate with the orbiter altho thats not jeopardizing the mission. Theres already a lot of things transmitted successfully to the orbiter. Contact between the orbiter and the probe can be done twice per day.EDIT  The first place it touched the comet was exaclty where it was planned flat and cosy too bad it didnt harpoon there.EDIT  Next contact will be near GMT until GMT approx.This night they made contact with the probe from the orbiter at about GMT and at GMT they had safely recovered all the data from the first batch of tests.From the ESA blog  The team are ensuring that Rosetta maintains an orbit that is optimised for lander communication support they are planning a manoeuvre thruster burn today to be conducted on Friday that will help keep Rosetta where it should be. Rosetta already conducted a burn last night as part of this effort.Rosetta is presently sending signals to the ground stations at about  Kbps Ignacio says that the spacecrafts own telemetry downlink uses about  or  Kbps of this so the rest is being used to download science data from Rosetta and lander science and telemetry from the surface.Important press conference from ESA at GMT. Over now.  EDIT  So there was more photos and details. Important bit theyre planning on righting the lander studying the best way to do it. First rebound was about m long .ms up lasted  hours. nd rebound was .ms  minutes long. Then it stuck itself in the side of the crater at the rd impact. EDIT  Harpoons received the signal to fire but didnt activate. Theres no indication of damage on solar panels. The lander can hibernate and may likely still work several monthes from now even if under limited power. They confirmed the orbiter will make adjustement tomorrow morning friday to optimize communication time with the lander. Operations are prioritized from the less risky to the most.EDIT  First darkish panorama  Reading the comments below I agree with you guys the ESA PR is not great it was hard to get informations and the filming of the control centers during the landings was underwhelming to say the least. We french people were kinda lucky to get infos a bit earlier because some journalists managed to interview techs and engineers directly before the official scheduled press meetings... for once we were not the last to know nd daily press conference from ESA today friday at GMT.

But without the NASA contract Dreamchaser might not advance as planned and ESA isnt going to want to pay all the remaining development costs for that. And Orion has a few advantages over Dreamchaser more delta v meaning ESA could use it for ISS reboosts as they did with ATV the service module is built in Europe so it provides jobs and if ESA ever does get involved in manned BEO missions theyll already have a capable vehicle and just need a new launcher for it.

Thats going to involve hypothesis prototypes experimentation failure alligator mitigation systems unpredictability in schedule. More science than engineering.No its not.  Thats pure engineering.  As long as all the technology and physics already exists to make a robohovercraft which it does then its only a matter of engineering to put it all together into a working system.  This isnt a trivial task by any means mind you but it is not science its engineering.  We already have hovercraft and have had them for decades and we pretty much have driverless cars now Googles have driven thousands of miles errorfree.  Making an automated hovercraft to cross a river really isnt that hard in comparison.If the boss wanted robohovercraft which used antigravity instead of an air cushion now that would require science specifically fundamental physics.  And it likely wont be doable for a long time if ever because our current understanding of physics does not allow for antigravity without an absolutely ridiculous amount of energy according to physicists Ive conversed with.Or if the boss wanted to know what the effect of the robohovercraft might be on the ecology of the river that too would involve science specifically environmental science as the scientists would have to set up some kind of study and gather data about the ecosystem there and the hovercrafts effect on it.,space,cmdrdyq,11,t5_2qh87

2500651,0,t1_cmkyq04,I think the reason NdT was talking to us like  year olds is that this series was not made for people like you and me. It was made for people who are basically scientifically illiterate and he had to dumb it down for them as much as possible to get them on board.Also it was definitely aimed at kids to spark some interest in it that will later foster into something greater and also to combat the hurr durr the earth is  years old crowd.  He has stated he considers the adults a lost cause.  I thought the way they dealt with something as complex as evolution with the makeup of the eye was about a simple and ironclad as you could present it.  Hopefully some kid somewhere being indoctrinated with the bullshit will see it and take a look around and realize none of it jives with what he sees but what NdT said does jive.Now with that groundwork laid he can open it up and get into the more complex parts of spacetime.

You will eventually get SOME because you are orbiting at slightly different orbits which will induce very small changes in relative velocity and orientation as you orbit the planet but I digress. Put the Purple Circle to the center of your navball and go full reverse thrust until it reaches . Make sure you are reasonably close to the station before you do this. Then with very little thrust try moving the ship into position near the docking port and then zero out your relative velocity again.

It orbited Mars in a very elliptical  hour orbit that took it high above the Martian surface allowing it to capture sweeping vistas like this. You dont see many images like this from more modern missions because their orbits dont take them nearly as high as the Viking Orbiters. Despite their great vantage points the Vikings rarely took these sorts of global shots. This is mainly due to storage issues  this particular mosaic consists of about  separate subframes. That chewed through the data budget since Viking rarely took more than  images per orbit.This mosaic was shot through Vikings red filter which boosts the contrast on surface features. Front and center is the km diameter Argyre impact basin thought to have been formed during the Late Heavy Bombardment . billion years ago. Perched on its rim is the impact crater Galle perhaps more well known as the Smiley Face crater due to the arrangement of features inside the crater. At the bottom right corner is the remnant of the South Polar ice cap. When this picture was taken it was midsummer in Marss southern hemisphere and most of the cap had evaporated. In winter the cap dramatically expands in size and heavy frost can coat the ground as further north than Argyre. rds up on the left edge you can see a bright area.

The issue with a typical suspension is the added complexity and mass to the system.

A suspension system sounds nice until you start looking at all the pieces you need to protect against different environments especially if designing a lander for various missions and the added complexity and need to provetest the technology. Where a typical mission will fly will have a flat space big enough for a lander and finding this and using honeycomb crush pads for final impact which is a crushable piece of perforated metal which is very simple and has been proven to work was a better engineering solution.

If you look at the picture from the big bang to right now. Then there appears a goal. A rather straight forward one. To increase complexity. To achieve greater computational abilities.gtNature is not sentient and therefore your statement about nature not liking wastefulness is ridiculous. Also you mentioned before that clearly complexity is the purpose of life. This is completely baseless because what then is the purpose of greater complexity? What happens when the greatest possible complexity is reached? Can it ever be reached? It doesnt matter because the universe doesnt give a shit and has no purpose.You right there made an assumption on sentience. But the fact is if I could know the vector and position of every atom that constituted you I would know your every choice your ever opinion and you would appear as nothing more than a more complex machine. You would not be sentience. You would just be doing what youre programmed to do. Sentience simply put is nothing more than a consequence of the uncertainty principal.gtdid you know that very often two people will be strongly attracted to one another because their immune systems would produce an even stronger immune system in their offspring. This study is questionable given the role of contraceptives in the study in addition to it being based off attractiveness of smell alone.gtAnd again just because the universe expands and contracts DOES NOT mean it has a purpose to do so.Then why does it?gtWhy does light exist for example?Light technically doesnt exist. Its just the result of your brain reading information from your eye receptors. Photons exists however. And the purpose of photos is to transmit energy.gtthe universe allow it to exist and cause it to exist through various natural processesThis fulfills the definition of a purpose.gtIf i push a ball down a hill it has movement in a certain direction but there is no purpose for the movement only a physical cause.You pushed it.

Throttle is controlled by both the turbopumps and the inlet valves.  A small portion of the propellant is burned to power the turbopump. and varying the inlet valves in turn varies turbopump speed thus changing thrust..  Yes they are.  The top of the engine is where the gimbal mount is.  The engine itself combustion chamber and engine bell is basically a static block.  Regarding the actuator drift  its entirely possible but I dont have a man on the inside so I cant be sure..  I believe the avionics are mounted to the thrust structure though dont quote me on that..

As far as the space program goes we had lost people on the ground but never during an actual launch or in space. Apollo  was a close call though thus our national pride in the space program was still off the charts. Also the space shuttle was considered an incredible piece of technology for the time. The three shuttle main engines generated a total of  million horsepowerlet that sink in for a minuteMany of us were still stinging from the Carter economic disaster and the loss of pride from the Iran hostage rescue failure. Although Reagan had his detractors he still managed to restore our national pride and by the time of the Challenger disaster the economy was recovering nicely.Again besides the loss of life the kick in the gut from this tragedy still stays with many of us.,space,co3nelk,0,t5_2qh87

Add interacting with orbital bodies multiply you requirements by a significant amount.

It fires engines only for tiny subtle trajectory corrections its most powerful burn at Saturn to date was a deltav of only . ms!gtThe main engine firing will last about a minute and will provide a change in velocity of  feet per second . meters per second. This is the largest maneuver by Cassini in five years. No other remaining maneuver comes close in the amount of propellant it will consume and the amount by which it will change the spacecrafts velocity. By contrast the smallest maneuvers Cassini routinely executes are about . inches  millimeters per second.It gets much larger impulses from close flybys of moons which it targets.Of course this flythrough is fake images are real motion is fake.

3111989,0,t1_cokeap8,Sure!I pull out something called an EQ mount which is like a tripod but it has a special top that rotates at the same speed as the night sky. That way I can take long exposure images but not get star trails.I put my telescope onto the mount and attach my camera at the end where the eyepiece normally goes. Its like using a huge lens for my camera.I attach an autoguider to my telescope which is a tiny telescope with another specialized camera on the back. The EQ mount is good but small mechanical error is inevitable and so stars do sometimes streak in longer exposures. The autoguider camera monitors some star in the sky and if it sees a drift due to mount error it can correct the mount very quickly before my camera collects enough light to have noticed the change.All together I can take long exposures with this setup. I chose five minute shots because I knew the Moon was gonna come up and it washes out my shots. If I had done  minutes itd have been way too bright.I take a series of images. I want the longest exposure time possible but its not practical to take one  hour exposure. So I take a lot of  minute exposures and on the computer I can combine them effectively creating a  hour exposure. I used a program called PixInsight.Using that same program I can enhance the galaxy and reduce camera noise looks like grain in the image so that although what we see here is what my camera saw it looks dynamic and interesting. Raw camera images of deep space objects often look dull or nearly invisible because cameras are linear detectors and our eyes arent. That is our eyes are great at detecting small changes in dark areas but cant detect small changes in bright areas. A camera can detect these changes perfectly. So this is why its no good to just leave the image as is.,space,cokk1ov,2,t5_2qh87

No you spend it on tvs and video games. Its not nasas job to spend money on poor people. Much like its not a mobile phone companies job to spend money on poor people. Poor people have always been here. And likely always will be. There arent enough resources for the amount of people here especially considering how much we waste and use for not necessary things. So much money. Warfare. Entertainment. Luxuries. Most things we buy have had millions of pounds spent on it. How about everyone on the planet just care about poor people?  Earths ALWAYS had problems. Theres a universe out there. A universe that is potentially infinite. You think in this infinite universe there isnt the answers to our problems? This is the single most important thing for us to do. For our species. Not for individuals. If this was a video game space travel would be the main storyline. And it sucks to have to say stop caring about poor people. And its not that blunt. Theres lots of money on the planet some can still be spent on poor people. But problems have always been on the planet the planet isnt perfect nor is it permanent. We need to get out there. I dont understand why its such a low priority for governments. Theyre so focused on today they forget about tomorrow. Tomorrow will come and were gunna be fucked. But its alright.

In order to see the MWG as it was millions of years ago we would have to have access to the light that it emitted millions of years ago. For this to happen the galaxy would have to catch up with the light that it emitted millions of years ago which is impossible because for that to happen it would have to be moving faster than the speed of light.How far back in time a galaxy is seen is directly related to how far away that galaxy is from the observer. Far away galaxies appear older but since the Milky Way is so close we basically see it in real time. It doesnt matter how far away the Milky Way once was because the light that it emitted at that point traveled faster than the galaxy did.,space,cp47peq,2,t5_2qh87

Im not sure how thick the rocky interiors are but youre almost certainly right that it should be smaller.  Many Kupier Belt Objects which are similar to these moons in some ways actually are over  water since at those distances ice does not sublimate.  Their oceans are there due to a combination of heat from compression tidal forces and possibly radioactive decay in the core.One factor that I doubt this GIF takes into account is the fact that Earth doesnt only have water on the surface.  The mantle actually contains quite a bit of water the Moon even has subsurface water in the mantle although neither I nor anyone else knows exactly how much    After accounting for this and of course the equivalent processes if any on Europa its a wild guess how much water is in either place.,space,cpdd411,1,t5_2qh87

Have a nice Day.gtSince Galileo was designed to provide the highest possible precision greater than GPS to anyone the US was concerned that an enemy could use Galileo signals in military strikes against the US and its allies some weapons like missiles use GNSS systems for guidance. The frequency initially chosen for Galileo would have made it impossible for the US to block the Galileo signals without also interfering with its own GPS signals. The US did not want to lose their GNSS capability with GPS while denying enemies the use of GNSS. Some US officials became especially concerned when Chinese interest in Galileo was reported.gtAn anonymous EU official claimed that the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites in the event of a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces. The EUs stance is that Galileo is a neutral technology available to all countries and everyone. At first EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo but have since reached a compromise that Galileo was to use a different frequency. This allowed the blocking or jamming of either GNSS system without affecting the other jam Galileo without affecting GPS or jam GPS but not Galileo giving the US a greater advantage in conflicts in which it has the electronic warfare upper hand.,space,cpk4w0t,58,t5_2qh87

3572400,0,t1_cpytjsw,There are three kinds of probe missions Discovery New Frontiers and Flagship. Discovery is right out because the cost cap is M and designing a probe that could survive a flight to Uranus would exceed that pretty quickly.Flagship missions mostly start as political projects promoted by either someone at the White House a congressperson or a higherup at NASA and get funded on somewhat arbitrary timelines. The most recent one was Curiosity and it seems like the next one will be Europa Clipper. A Uranus mission is high in the Decadal Survey but I dont think it excites enough people to be a Flagship. New Frontiers is probably the best bet as the cost range B would probably cover the cost of a modest Uranus orbiter and the missions are far enough apart that we could build up a reserve of plutonium for an RTG to power the craft. New Frontiers missions are selected from a list of proposals informed by the Decadal Survey but that list does not currently contain a Uranus proposal. The next selection will be made in  then the following selection will be  and the proposals eligible for both rounds have already been selected. The  proposal shortlist could still change but likely the first eligibility would be . Thats a good thing though because no rocket currently flying can do a direct injection to Uranus but both SLS and the SpaceX superheavy rocket should be flying steadily by the time the  selection is expected to launch in . Doing a direct injection means that a launch window for Uranus opens every  months so that simplifies things considerably. So plausible bestcase scenario a Uranus mission is announced in  launches in  and arrives in  after a year Hohmann transfer. The Planetary Society is working on an outline for a scenario where NASAs budget only increases with inflation and money for human space flight only comes from the current budget of SLSOrion plus the budgets of ISS and Commercial Crew once the ISS ends in . In that outline the first manned mission to orbit Mars or land on Phobos launches on SLS in  and the first mission to land on Mars launches in . The nd or rd mission to Mars would be taking place at the same time as the Uranus missions enters orbit and the Mars crew or a Phobos base might be tasked with helping to relay signals.,space,cpzhc96,5,t5_2qh87

Theyll be flying back to land near the launch site once theyve demonstrated the ability to land on the barge.The Space Shuttles solid boosters were basically just huge ridonculously strong steel tubes. Coming down in the ocean under parachutes didnt really hurt them and there werent a lot of fiddly mechanical bits that had to survive seawater.

In this case the there are really two possibilities.  the universe is flat and stretches on and on and you can travel forever in a straight line without ever returning to your starting point.  The universe is curved  in a higher dimension and traveling in straight line would bring you back to the starting point. Right now we dont know if space is flat or curved I believe the best guess we have right now is that it is curved but im happy to be corrected on this.

3754949,0,t3_33c8xr,There is the original momentum of the big bang driving things apart but the expansion you mentioned is also accelerating. This is due to a repelling phenomena labeled Dark Energy. It does not tear galaxies or solar systems apart because in those formations gravity is stronger but in between galaxies gravity is to weak to halt it. What is happening is that space it self is growing in size! So the galaxies are not in this sense accelerating away by motion from a fixed point. Space in between them is growing bigger. It is as if you placed dots on a piece of paper at a certain distance from eachother and the paper increased in size. The distance between the dots would become bigger. This accelerated expansion of space it self significantly lessens the chance of collisions between galaxies. In enough time it will completely eliminate collisions at all.,space,cqkai6e,2,t5_2qh87

I wouldnt call that tiny by any means. gtPrimary school children can learn metric at much earlier ages...They do. I learned both systems in elementary school. Who cares if imperial is a little harder? The kids need to do some harder math to practice their skills. For example little Timmy is four feet tall. How many inches tall is he? In school we mostly used metric in science class. But my point is that the average citizen automatically thinks in imperial and has little reason to change. I know right off the bat that Im . No clue off the top of my head how many centimeters tall I am. I know the speed limit is  miles per hour on the highway. I know this place is  miles from that place. I like getting pints at the bar.

The reason its so hard to explore is also the reason theres water there in the first place its covered in permanent darkness.

Over the several dozen or hundred million years that the moon was likely molten I would imagine that even if this was a slow process there was plenty of time for it to occur.I could be wrong but thats how I always figured it happened.Edit A clear case of Just because it makes sense doesnt make it right.

4035151,0,t3_36qmgd,Please keep in mind that speed does not cause time dilation.coasting at  of the speed of light would not cause time to slow down for your spacecraft.Accelerationdeceleration is what causes time dilation.I remember our science teacher trying to explain the twins paradox.  It has some very specific assumptions. One of which is that during your journey you spend the entire time first accelerating then decelerating to turn around then accelerate back then decelerate upon arrival to earth.Another assumption is that your engine could produce infinite thrust.So any journeys that assume time dilation for the entire trip would also have to assume that the ship is using its infinitely powerful engines.   So until we have a ship that meets those assumptions you cant really expect to have slowed time on your side for the trip.Edit OK so my original statement was oversimplified for this audience but this is good! Great discussion!What I should have said was that observational time dilation due to a difference in relative velocity is reciprocal.So from earth clocks on the ship would appear to slow and from the ship clocks on earth would appear to slow.To slow the ageing process for ship passengers in regards to all reference frames you need the non reciprocal effects of gravitational time dilation.,space,crg8kcu,0,t5_2qh87

4195906,0,t1_crye58g,Thank you well said. I think the reason size often gets brought up in this discussion other than the word dwarf in dwarf planet is that when we discovered that Pluto was not special sizewise in its neighborhood it made us question the definition of what a planet really is. It had always been the oddball of the bunch anyway seeming more like a comet than a planet but then when we realized there were many other similarlysized objects out there that became the impetus behind rethinking our classifications. I think had we never found anything past Neptune bigger than the average asteroidcomet it would probably still be considered a planet. As it turns out Pluto just happens to be the closest and relatively brightest of the larger TransNeptunian Objects which explains why Tombaugh discovered Pluto  years before Eris was detected. ,space,cryj3f9,2,t5_2qh87

Life is a very rare thing and an advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel I think would appreciate this rarity and try to preserve it as best as they could. I also believe that these aliens would be weary of even landing on the earth. Considering they could bring along many unknown viruses their bodies are evolved to fight when it would be completely new to us and we probably wouldnt have the technology to create a cure in time before a mass epidemic. Plus if they can make it here they can make it to many other places with far more abundant resources. It just really wouldnt be worth the time and effort. I think the only reason they would even be interested in our solar system is because its something of an oddball and could be used for research.

The axis on which you travel would be length contracted though. And also bluered shifted like you allude to so behind you there would be darkness and ahead of you there would be light too high in frequency to register it but its energy would announce that its really there.But I think the length contraction is the more interesting aspect A spherical galaxy would look be almost like a disk. The plane of the disk would be exactly perpendicular to the axis of travel. E.g. if you start on Earth and then accelerate to high speed so that a distance Earth would interpret as  LY can be traversed by you in  year of your subjective time the length along your axis of travel would have to be a wee bit less than one light year so space would be about a million times flatter along that axis.

If they can get here they can get to any number of other planets or chunks of rock floating through space that is chock full of whatever we have here.  However our ability to understand even the most basic of mathematical concepts has to be intriguing to them.  Not to mention Beethoven you dig?  Sure you could with an authority claim that their perceptions of sound would differ from ours and that they would never hear Beethoven the same way we do... but we are talking about a civilization that has figured out how to manipulate spacetime in order to get here.  With a few genetic samples and a bit of the sort of ingenuity they are obviously capable of Im sure they could figure out how to hear it.What I am getting at is that if an advanced race has any need whatsoever to harm us in even the slightest way we are living in one super superduper fucked up universe.And thats possible... but I think the most likely scenario would be that they just watch us.  And the only reason I think they would just watch us is due to an ethical consideration in regards to disrupting our natural order and evolution.  I mean we are shitty ancient people... and yet as it currently stands if we were to find a hut of tiny monkeys on Europa there is no way in hell we would just land a machine next to it and jump out and say Whats up! you know?  We would study them from afar for decades if not longer... debating how making such a contact would even work.  There would be massive debates on what would happen if we did it wrong and ruined their culture and caused chaos... god forbid their extinction due to fear and existential confusion.  And thats US NOW!  Imagine what a crazy advanced civilization with the benefit of advanced minds and a much more vast history to learn from would consider in regards to their not stepping on our anthill?,space,csc8rbk,0,t5_2qh87

You would need a second system to tighten the noose around the rocket as it passes through it. The noose would need to tighten fast enough that it catches the rocket as it passes through but not too violently as to crush the rocket. For this to work like an aircraft arresting hook the rocket would need to somehow grab the cable on its approach. For an aircraft missing the cable means you abort the landing and try it again while colliding with the cable is pretty much impossible due to its position relative to the deck In the case of a rocket missing or colliding with the cable are both very real possibilities and in either case will result in the destruction of the rocket. ,space,csiv1mp,5,t5_2qh87

My opinion with nothing to back it up is that if we released terraforming bacteria they will wipe out most of the remaining native Martian species but a few will have retained DNA capable of dealing with oxygen and these will bloom and release poisons as a defense.

DNA disintegrates over time and it is the reason we havent found any TRex DNA in the soft tissue we found fairly recently. The organism would have to be able to constantly repair its DNA or replicate it while it is living its life on the rock floating through space.This theory is one that can probably never be proved right or wrong. Even if we found DNA on an asteroid tomorrow it doesnt fully prove whether Earth did or didnt create DNA on its own. However after recently taking a microbiology class I am wondering what the steps were before modern DNA. The mechanisms inside a cell are AMAZING.

At least for now.Advanced civilisations would most likely be older than ours We are undoubtly infantile as an space traveling civilisation. Which means that they probably already would have known about us for many years and would have the means not only to contact us  but doing it in a way which make the message clear and crisp as a HD broadcast and adapted to our inferior technology.Reasons a alien civilisation would hesitate could be several though.We might be considered immature. Not ready to learn about exotic physic and technology which could include things like AI artificial Black Holes or near lightspeed vehicles. Technology which could present a huge threat for our neighbors if used wrong. If that is the case we might even be on a information filter.They could also be hesitating because we are on the brink to discover smarter and faster communication gear.Rather than start a dialogue with hundreds or even thousands of years lag it would make sense to wait decades until we discover fast communication dumping information into one black hole and extract it from another for a hypothetical example.They might already be talking with us. In lifelike simulations.If a alien civlisation have reach a Singularity they might simply be simulating a dialogue with us and are consider that simulation exactly as real and giving as actual dialogue.The only disadvantage of a simulated conversation is of course we are not gaining  anything from it.

This has been done with radio telescopes Verylongbaseline interferometry to get astounding resolution by simulating a radio telescope with the diameter of the earth.  It is much harder to combine optical telescopes since the precision is much tighter with the much shorter wavelength.  It is just now becoming more realistic with new advances in adaptive optics and some telescopes like the Large Binocular Telescope are making it a priority to advance this technology.  If we can wrangle this technology into everyday observatory work on earth some day in the future we could link space telescopes the same way and have an array of telescopes orbiting in a huge pattern around the Sun that could theoretically resolve extrasolar planets.

A great place for information is the Astronomy Forum on Stack ExchangeThe space between the galaxies is expanding over time in accordance with the Hubble Constant this means that the further something is away from us the faster it is expanding away more space between us and the object to expand.  So in a sense it is pulling galaxies with it away from us.  The galaxies themselves are not expanding but all of space is.This means that new light created from very distant objects will take longer and longer to reach us because theyre moving further away.

Above this mass the remnant collapses to form a black hole. The theoretical limiting mass for this type of core collapse scenario is about  M.

More importantly if we launched separate habitation sections in line with the boosters they could have been repurposed as sections of the ISS while a normal crew capsule could have been used to return from missions.  lbs is an unnecessary amount of weight.

4772726,0,t3_3g9cds,Practical has connotations of makes economic sense and not too hard to do.  So when you ask How practical is it? the answer for now is not at all.  If you ask in a future where we have selfbuilding automated factories that then build habitats and contents the answer is very.  But colonizing deserts oceans and ice caps on Earth and everywhere in the Solar System on surfaces and in free space will be practical too.  Asking about one particular location is like asking if it is practical to colonize Massachusetts in .  Why not the rest of the New World?Selfbuilding factories begin from a starter kit a seed factory.  The starter kit has basic machines like a solar furnace lathe modular robot etc.  The starter kit uses local energy and materials to make parts for more machines plus some imported items for what it cant make yet.  As you add more machines you can make a bigger assortment of items and need to import less stuff.  Eventually the factory is big enough to make habitats and all the stuff people use including new starter kits.Bringing entire factories and habitats to a place like Mars would be a massive undertaking even with cheap rockets.  It makes more sense to deliver just a starter kit and build the rest on location.  I think its a key technology for practical space colonies.gt How different is the gravity on Mars and would it negatively affect longterm residents?Mars is ths Earth gravity.  Nobody knows the long term effects.  We have lots of data on . Earth gravity because we evolved on Earth.  We have some data on . gravity from things like the Space Station.  We have no long term data on levels between  and  the Moon landings were too short.  Thats why I think a variable gravity research facility VGRF is needed.  Thats a rotating habitat where you can vary the gravity level and have people and plants and things spend extended time periods aboard.  Until we collect the data we dont know what we need to do for a permanent base or colony.At worst we could build domed habitats on Mars and install rotating quarters around the rim think like the inside of a toploading washer or rim of a merrygoround.  These would rotate at  gravity or whatever minimum level is needed for human health.  But thats complicated and it would be a lot easier to just wear body weights and take some drugs if that would be enough.gt How about the unborn or the recently born?Fetuses live in amniotic fluid so are floating already.  Presumably they would be less affected but we dont know and its immoral to experiment on the unborn.  Lots of research is needed.gt Are there practical considerations like these to consider?Im a space systems engineer who helped build the Space Station the closest thing to a Mars Colony so far.  Yes there are tons of practical considerations that the average space enthusiast hasnt considered. Like what do you do with farts?  On the ISS we have to scrub the atmosphere of all kinds of human byproducts.  How do you prevent condensation on the inside of the aluminum modules when its not warmed by the Sun?  This is the same thing that happens on Earth to cold aluminum cans.  The answer is a combination of humidity control airflow and warmth from all the active equipment.  I could list a hundred more but suffice to say any human habitat has to consider many many things to be even remotely safe and last for years.gt All I really ever read about is terraforming and atmospheric seeding but never these things.Terraforming doesnt make economic sense until you have many many people living on a planet many millions.  Until then it makes more sense to only terraform the area under habitat domes.  The Earths atmosphere is  tons per human and Earth is pretty well populated.  On a less populated Mars the figure would be higher per person to terraform.  Domes would be less work.,space,ctw582r,27,t5_2qh87

Thats because when you propose such a mission you make promises about how long it will last and it is very expensive to push much further than a few years when selecting components. Better to just say  years and then push the mission end in twothree year slices when you have an idea how well the hardware is doing.To give a point of reference Rosetta was  years from idea to launch  I expect telescopes to be much more fickle though.

The gravity isnt all that incredible from an astrological standpoint only about . times that of earth. This also means that the gases we see arent very dense. Much of what we see is gases swirling around at less than earths atmospheric pressure. Its only when we start to get a little deeper that things get really crazy. Also while the wind speeds at the red spot are incredible near the poles it would be much more accessible for a probe to enter and hang out for a little while in.

5099068,0,t1_cv0ke8p,To expand on thisThere are two main forces at work in a star. Radiation pressure which is the force of the photons created in the center of the star attempting to escape and gravity collapsing the mass of the star inwards. The majority of a stars lifetime is spent when it is fusing hydrogen at a steady rate and therefore its volume doesnt change. Gas Pressure is another force at work here which is what usbcontt was thinking of. Gas pressure isnt enough by itself though to counteract gravity.Eventually the star runs out of hydrogen and gravity is now stronger than radiation pressure. This causes the star to start to collapse. The increased density in the core now can start to fuse heavier elements. These elements skyrocket the radiation pressure and the star expands. These two forces start shifting back and forth at the end of the stars lifetime which creates the change in size mentioned. Each cycle is progressively shorter as it takes more starting energy to fuse heavier elements. In stars this large the last stage is the creation of iron. Iron and heavier elements are special though because they dont release energy to fuse. They just absorb it. So when radiation pressure from creating elements lighter than iron runs out the outer shell of the star crashes back into the core under the force of gravity and the core absorbs energy to create iron. The outer shell bounces off the core and flies out into space to create these Our universe is truly amazing. ,space,cv0mm8k,37,t5_2qh87

Its a material with the properties we need for a project but cant be obtained from our usual suppliers.  It can become the target for RampD if there is sufficient need for it.An example is Titanium Aluminide which came from the need for a material with the properties of Nickel superalloys but half the weight.  It was Unobtainium until ways were developed to process it and get the properties you wanted.  Mixing Aluminum and Titanium is easy.  Producing it in a form suitable for aerospace parts isntSilicon is another example.  The metal has been around for about two centuries.

Im not arguing with you Im just curious If we do manage to survive being kicked out of the galaxy then eventually the Sun or Earth will fall into the central galactic supermassive black hole after around  years  nonillion.  Current estimates are that theres about a few percent chance that this happens.  So if we wait long enough yes we might end up merging with our central supermassive black hole.

There are issues with this option though which make it a challenge to combine them.Two only shoot moonrises before sunset. I prefer this way because the only way to shoot a landscape without blowing the moon out to white is when the moon and the landscape can have correct exposures that are not too far apart i.e. before the sun goes down. This also can give you a blue sky which is much preferable to a featureless black sky. Definitely preferable to a featureless black sky with a solid white disc of a moon.Those are for single exposures. For a time lapse I have found LRTimelapse to be a fantastic solution that allows you to change the exposure over time by hand then automatically smooths out the transitions for you.,space,cvd3epr,1,t5_2qh87

Its thought that in some of the deepest craters that lie in eternal darkness in the poles there is water ice that has never seen the light of the sun. Both Russia China and ESA are planning moon bases at the south lunar pole to investigate. It might also be worth finding out how much metal there is on the moon. Moon mining could become a profitable thing in the future but I cant think of any reasons why it would be superior to asteroid mining other then its closer proximity.

5296504,0,t3_3njjrr,Andy Weir the author of the book made sure to do a lot of research on every subject and make sure it would be possible. Mars only have  of the Earth atmosphere so you would be able to get into space without a nosecone. Mars is much more similar to the Moon in that regard. However the lack of atmosphere also means that the winds are not strong at all. The winds would not be able to topple the MAV or the communications array. That part were added to the book for dramatics. Sandstorms do happen on Mars and can be much bigger and with much higher wind speeds then anything on Earth but there is almost no atmosphere to add mass to the storms and they are mostly driven by the sand in them.The other part that does not match reality is the hydrazine scene. Hydrazine is highly poisonous very explosive and creates even more poisonous gases when burned. If Mark or his potato plants would not have been killed by the poisons they would have burned to death in the intense heat.I also find the freefall scenes very artificial as opposed to those in Gravity. There is also a scene in space where two characters are spinning with a tether and stops spinning as they pull each other towards each other which violates the conservation of momentum.The next unrealistic scene was where Mark were lecturing to future astronauts. Astronauts today are military test pilots andor scholars with years and years of experience behind them even before they join the astronaut corps. Most people today have kids in collage before they gets to be astronauts. Things might change in the future but we would most likely want to send up the best of the best which is unlikely to be a bunch of recent collage graduates.,space,cvootrw,1,t5_2qh87

The images we do get which in any way resemble what youd see with the naked eye are composites from many different detectors gathering light at many different wavelengths and the result of many weeks and even months careful analysis by the mission team.And as important as it is to drum up public interest by showing off images which look cool NASA are primarily a research group not a PR firm. Images are often released in falsecolour as falsecolour highlights surface features making detailed analysis of the images themselves easier.Theres also the issue of copyright. Part of NASAs income is from selling data to external companies for analysis. It cant reasonably be expected for them to just make everything they do i.e. the result of much hard work from many dedicated scientists completely free to the public otherwise it would harm their income.,space,cw4343b,6,t5_2qh87

Future instruments ESPRESSO would be able to detect Uranus and Neptune and maybe Earth and Venus.   note the solar system planets labeled with symbols.. Note that the radial velocity depends on the planets distance from the star.

5498424,0,t1_cwde39h,Any communication done by an intelligent civilization would require a tight beam of energy at a specific wavelength or wavelengths in order to be able to read the information in the beam at the end point.So what we do is we point a radio telescope which detects light in the radio frequencies which tend to be better suited to communications because they travel further without hitting random particles at a star we think might have a civilization capable of constructing radios. If we see any spike of energy at any radio wavelength we can investigate to see if it is a natural emission or a sign of intelligent life. Thats really the best idea we have.

5498730,0,t1_cwe5dmq,Sorry but I have no patience to watch videos. Why cant people just write a text and put some figures providing instant D access to information? Anyhow in the s and s NASA did a lot of tests with centrifugues and found out that the only relevant side effect of centrifugal gravity was disorientation caused by the spin in your inner ear  sort of like when you spin around yourself. However if you create a habitat at least  meters in radius people wouldnt feel a thing. Thats why the smaller habitat design the Island One see infographic here has exactly those dimensions.More recently other studies took in consideration that actually there is a wide range of tolerances to spin disorientation in humans see for instance fighter jet pilots. So if we first select people who are tolerant to disorientation then we can have much smaller habitats initially perhaps even small rotating ships like we see in Interstellar and The Martian. You can see details on that in the slides of a recent presentation by Al Globus a NASA collaborator. By the way he also proposes that the first settlements should be built inside in the magnetosphere and in an equatorial orbit in order to avoid altogheter the need for radiation shielding.,space,cweijlx,1,t5_2qh87

5523915,0,t1_cwdzb25,I think you significantly underestimate the willingness of the DoD to plan for and build hardware for a mission that might never be greenlit by the civilians in control of the military.The large vertical stabilizer on the Shuttle was required to enable the craft to make substantial changes of direction whilst in the upper atmosphere a requirement of the DoDs plans to snag Soviet space hardware out of orbit. In turn the addition of that huge stabilizer altered the entire design of the Shuttle itself and made it substantially heavier and more complex than NASA wanted. But since NASA couldnt get the Shuttle funded itself it required a subsidy from the DoD which the DoD would not provide unless the Shuttle could do the snatch mission nobody ever really thought would be authorized. Its been theorized that the entire requirement was really nothing more than a way to force NASA to cancel the project and when NASA managed to convince Nixons budget cutters to proceed it caught the DoD with its hand in the cookie jar.,space,cwhqa5s,1,t5_2qh87

Check if your local library has some astrophotography books sometimes you can even request they buy them  I did with mine. Also if you have an astronomy club there is bound to be some imagers who will help you get your feet wet and provide some advice on where to start and what to avoid. I will say this if you want to get a telescope get a small refractor mm or so preferably an apochromatic telescope if your budget can swing it do NOT get a SCT schmidt cassegrain. Also the mount is the most important piece of kit you will own I spent  times as much on my mount as my telescope. This may be down the road info for you but a cheap mount is an expensive mistake.

5735165,0,t1_cx7zfn2,Yeah I was thinking about something like a VASMIR just for that purpose of boosting ISS to a parking orbit somewhere. The total Deltav requirements would be pretty large to get something like ISS to a higher orbit let alone try to change inclination. Taking it apart and moving it in pieces is also a possibility like the Russians are potentially discussing doing with their segments after the station is finally retired. Lets see how that tech matures in the coming years as we draw closer to scrapping the ISS.Coming up with a simple space tug would be a good idea to have in the vehicular arsenal up there actually  something that can rendezvous with satellites and stations and refuel them or tugtowmaneuver them onto other orbital profiles. The USAF even had one on the drawing board in the s until funding was cut but a vehicle like that on orbit will become an important tool as future civilian space operations expand.Indeed one may already exist that in part at least can potentially serve as a sort of space tug. This role may indeed be one of the major goals of the USAFs current and rather secretive XB spaceplane project. According to the published numbers the XBs Aerojet engine and RCS system provide a total on orbit deltav budget of . kilometers per second. That is damn impressive. Compare that to NASAs STS space shuttle which was much larger and where once on orbit I believe it had a total deltav budget of something like  meters per second that is with both OMS and RCS available for orbital maneuvering. The XB is of course launched atop an Atlas V too so it arrives on orbit fully fueled. Going by the numbers and the fact that on prior missions ground observers have already lost track of the XB multiple times due to its impressive orbital maneuvering in both altitude and inclination it should have some decent game in the station boosting department. With a energy budget like that it would be interesting to run the numbers and see how high an XB could boost ISS in a single mission.,space,cx804vh,1,t5_2qh87

It should also be noted that turning energy into mass will always create equal amounts of matter and antimatter and reacting those two will inevitably create waste particles and radiation that cant be used as thrust.

Grants will cover only the costs of operation much of the construction funds are coming out of endowments and donations.  This is not a for profit enterprise.  Hell some of those telescopes are getting by on budgets of less than a half million a year.As for land management the university has a right to remove anyone from the area as they are tasked by the state with managing it.  Simply because land is state owned does not give you a right to protest on it.  This is he same reason you cant just walk on an army base etc.  But we can all agree TMT has been quite generous and so far has not stopped any protests.  I think there has been only one day where protesters got out of line and for safety they had to call in the state to remove them but otherwise there has been a healthy level of protest at all areas even against people not working on TMT.,space,cxmapwz,2,t5_2qh87

Its like asking would you ever shoot a gun with answers being a Yes b No c Only to save my life. Those whod vote for b would almost always vote for c instead. Now on to the quiz. I made a few assumption  mainly that were talking about the first Martian  Venusian colony. I voted Only if it was the only way to survive. Why? Because life would suck. Essentially Id be living my whole life in a small box with a very small number of people God help you if you dont get along itd be extremely dangerous long time for resupply and if something fucks up oh boy! and there would be no luxuries. So essentially Ill be working long hours in a shit environment so I can return to my small boxsized home in said shit environment where theres nothing.

To begin with the launch pad needs a huge area several kilometers in radius around it to limit the effects on the surroundings of the rockets immense sound and the potential for damage if some thing goes wrong with the rocket. Then theres the complicated structure and systems that make up the launch pad as opposed to a much simpler runway. A launch pad is far more inconvenient than a long runway.Overall though I agree with the sentiment of the article.

5952559,0,t1_cxzkc0j,A couple reasons. Ive been looking into the deltav question and it appears that my intuitions were a bit pessimistic. A deltaIV heavy could probably deliver a lander. However radiation is definitely a limiting factor. Since Galileo orbited Jupiter it never spent a significant amount of time in the radiation belts. Have a look at the trajectory Also being from the s Galileos transistors were big and less susceptible to single event upsets caused by radiation. Undoubtedly a modern probe would demand more capable processors and therefore smaller transistors. This hints at a more fundamental question though what do we want a Europa lander to accomplish? Sure we could probably get something simple to land on the surface and hope for the best. But whats the point? Huygens was interesting but it was not a very sophisticated experiment. Most of the science was dedicated to the atmosphere and some data could be retrieved during descent so landing risks were not as big a deal. Presumably a Europa lander would want to drill and sample the ice. This is a much more difficult task than Huygens or Galileo. ,space,cxzwsm6,2,t5_2qh87

He responded that he was witholding comment for the moment but he used the word mokusatsu.  Mokusatsu means to remain in wise and masterly inactivity but it also means to treat with silent contempt.And so the response heard in the west was that the Japanese were treating the surrender terms of the allies with silent contempt.  The allies seeing this and knowing of the Japanese character  their refusal to surrender their suicide attacks and the like  which agreed with the response they perceived continued to attack and unleashed the most powerful weapons mankind had ever created.

They shut down the Yakima station and started doing all the newscommercial production for Yakima out of the TriCities.I moved to the TriCities.  They let go more than half the staff in one day so they could do the majority of the newscommercial production for Yakima and TriCities out of Spokane.Honestly the only reason the TriCities station even still exists is because Master Control fought tooth and nail to keep their department there instead of the business buying new equipment and having one person do master control for all three stations out of Spokane.  Im still surprised they managed to convince the company to do that.I gave up because I was tired of moving to cities I had no friends or connections in to attempt to stay in the industry.These days Im learning to program in python and learning some scripting with hopes of making a community television station that streams online via VLC.  Because I miss working in television and Ive worked nothing but bullshit jobs since.EDIT Since this post is in rspace I have to shareA while back NASA was testing a new lunar rover out in Moses Lake WA.  I was working in TriCities at the time.  I tried to convince our reporters to go out.  They said and I quote It is outside of our coverage area.

Further the first stages controlled descent means you need to take a larger area into account when determining if conditions are right.That said I dont think it will be very significant. It means one more factor to balance in though but if a delay seems like it might be more costly than just making another new rocket they could always fall back to ditching the first stage as a last resort anyway.,space,cy99cyp,3,t5_2qh87

As for the maximum speed possible to gain that is a little outside of my field but Im assuming that if you could get the probes close enough and make repeated passes with the right planet setup and relatively limitless time the speeds could get a little faster each time as the probe will continue to grab angular momentum from the planet. The limit I dont know but I would guess we could get much faster than we currently have but the overall limit is based more on practicality than possibility. ,space,cybo6p7,1,t5_2qh87

6122948,0,t1_cylkbbx,One reason Mars is more popular is fuel resources. On Mars water ice and CO are available essentially everywhere and fuel can be generated immediately. On the moon youd need to mine and process water ice in particular locations before you could make fuel which requires you to essentially build a whole colony before you can produce anything. In the long run building a colony on Mars is cheaper and easier if youve set up a lunar mining colony first but Apollostyle recon missions to Mars arent benefitted as much because the cost of the lunar infrastructure would be larger than the savings on the early Mars missions.The other and perhaps more meaningful reason is political. The Bushera Constellation missions were criticized as a repeat of Apollo which is a silly complaint because we have to build up those skills again anyway since weve lost them in the past  years. When Obama came in he had a been there done that attitude which a lot of people in America who are similarly ignorant of the history involved agreed with. So we have a bolder mission to Mars planned now. Its not a terrible plan because we still orbit the moon in the interim to practice deep space techniques nearby but there are worries its less sustainable than a moonbasefirst program.,space,cylm60l,8,t5_2qh87

However for inflatables the easiest shape to fabricate is a sphere but a cylinder with hemispherical ends is not that far behind. So the first step is making sure this work before going onto something more demanding structurally. To get enough force to make this useful youd also need a really big torus. Weve never build anything like this with inflatables but Im sure Bigelow is very interested in it. Additionally spinning artificial gravity has some interesting crosscoupling of acceleration due to coriolis effects.

6239800,0,t1_cyybx6c,You can certainly make something that isnt visible in a single photo visible by combining many. This applies to pretty much any signal not just photos. Think about it this way the frame will have a baseline amount of noise. You might have an object that is invisible because its brightness is say th of the brightness of the noise. However even though it will be swamped by the noise in any individual photo it will cause a slight bias noise at the position of that object will be on average  brighter. If you take many such noisy photos and combine them the random noise will average out towards zero but the bias will remain eventually making the object visible as the bias piles up while the random noise is reduced.Of course in practice this doesnt work forever there are other reasons why the noise wont perfectly average closer and closer to  and the process has diminishing returns as you take more photos its logarithmic but it does work to a significant extent.,space,cyywc21,1,t5_2qh87
6241142,0,t1_cyywc21,No not realy. In your example the object may be invinsible due to the noise but the signal is there. The stacking allows to make that signal which is th of the noise to be visible by reducing the noise. But you cant make something visible of which you have no signal. For example if you would set your camera to ISO  F and  you can stack as many pictures as you want you never will get darker object to become visible.,space,cyz1tgj,1,t5_2qh87

This in turn would mostlikely make habitability on said moon impossible because of the radiation that would probably be coming off of planet x if it is indeed a gas giant akin to Jupiter.

Since this planet was discovered by its gravitational influence on other objects in its zone it fits that criterion by definition.  With a  year orbit it has gone around the Sun more than  times since the formation of the solar system which is enough time to clear its orbit.We dont know where Planet  is in its orbit because its position is not correlated with the position of the smaller objects weve discovered in that zone.

6347668,0,t1_czb4mer,You dont need radhard components for Cubesats. For three reasons. Cubesats orbit on the inside of the VanAllen belts i.e. dont receive a lot of ion radiation in the first place and ion radiation is the only kind of radiation you have to care about. Photons dont have a lasting effect at least not in the energy ranges that are safeforearth Photon events that could damage consumer grade electronics are of the kind that would cause mass extinction in the Earths biosphere. Leptons are easily shielded by a few m of dense as in aluminium dense material. What you have to worry about are high energy ions. Given enough energy they can penetrate several cm of dense material with ease before dissipating their energy within the Bragg peak. Luckily the majority of these high energy ions are trapped in the VanAllen belts. But even if youd send a Cubesat into the VanAllen belts it would still last for several days before breaking beyond functionality.. The probability for a certain transistor to be hit by an high energy ion is very small. And the energies of the ions that actually make it into the region where Cubesats orbit are so large that the scattering cross section is extremely small which results in a very long free path length in matter and only very little energy placed in the semiconductor lattice. Too little to have lasting damage effects for a single event. What happens is that that one piece of circuitry produces a single event error and you have to account for errors like these anyway even in systems down here on Earth I did my physics Diploma graduation thesis on the damaging effects of hard ion radiation on semiconductor image sensors so I know a bit or two about the effects to expect.. The most important reason you dont need radhard for Cubesats They dont stay there that long. Theres indeed a hard limit set in international agreements on for how long a nano satellite may stay in orbit. The orbit for a nano satellite has to be chosen in a way that it will passively deorbit in a timely manner or the satellite itself must provide deorbiting capabilities. Since the lifetime is limited below the amount of time it would take for consumer grade electronics to receive lasting damage with a  probability its simpy not worth the effort.,space,czb5qhu,1,t5_2qh87

Seals which failed numerous times and NASA got lucky and failed once and NASA killed  astronauts.The boosters could be manufactured in one piece without segments and thus without joints that need to be sealed but theyd have to be built someplace with direct access to a port. Which is not Utah.Since Utah is always going to send  Republican Senators to Washington and those Senators tend to serve a long time becoming powerful within the institutional hierarchy of the Senate NASA has purchased an insurance policy that guarantees Republican support for its programs by placing the SRB production facility in that state.,space,czsceqk,1,t5_2qh87

All we know for sure is that based on what we can see from thousands of light years away is that they seem to have the effect of a giant gravity well that pulls shit in. Based on what we can perceive scientists have done long complicated math formulas to prove how these black holes come into existence and why we see other things interacting with them the way they do but none of that is certain and the math done to prove this stuff is based on our current understanding of physics which weve seen runs into problems of accuracy when dealing with astronomy and the universe given its huge scale. So the idea that a black hole is just crushing gravity pulling everything into a singularity and the idea that a black hole is just a massively complex gravity shield preserving the solar system of some advanced alien race contained inside are both probable explanations. The former is probably much more likely but the proof for either is still incredibly lacking. ,space,czv014t,1,t5_2qh87

Think about the cost of a mission like Curiosity  .b compared to a single launch of SLS at over b. To a modern budget conscious space agency and satellite manufacturer the launch costs will be too high to even consider the SLS unless itll have a ride share cost reduction program.

The shape was similar because both spacecraft had to deal with the same laws of aerodynamics but the internals and the overall philosophy was quite different.Mainly Buran had no engines which meant that its launch platform Energia could carry any number of other payloads beside Buran. Russian engineers correctly calculated that a shuttle would not lead to a cheap reusable space vehicle and abandoned the program after satisfying the leaderships demands for whatever the US is having.Buran flew perfectly but presented no advantage over Soyuz.

The two black holes colliding didnt create a vibration in the air no air in space but created vibrationswaves of gravity. When the two black holes collided they created a gravitational wave which is a ripple or wave in spacetime. The detected ripple looks like this which is probably why they used sound to describe it.Though I guess because of the way they measure the waves the data could be converted into a sound you can listen too.,space,czxz8ia,6,t5_2qh87

But because of the plasmas low density the sound is extremely weak but still sound.Heres an excerpt from the video descriptiongtThese are plasma waves. Many of these interactions occur at frequencies that are audible to humans. This doesnt mean that a human ear could hear them in space  the pressures are far too small  but it is conceivable that an ultrasensitive microphone could measure them. In practice however it is far easier to measure the oscillations in the accompanying electric and magnetic fields with antennas and that is just what we do.EDIT To the downvoters if Im incorrect can you help me understand why?,space,d00w7i9,-1,t5_2qh87

He had the right idea your blood already maintains a pressure higher than atmospheric so would be high enough to prevent your blood from flash vaporization.

Also a lot of earth orbiting satellites actually have plaques or time capsules on them. So it has been done. And the words designed to be found are rather arbritary we dont really know where other life is hanging out so it would be hard to send a probe to other life. Sending out multiple isnt really an option either because of money.

Its going to be challenging to work on it once its launched as itll be over  million km away.I do think that it would be worst flying to in order to fix some small mistake some hinge gets stuck. I believe they added a few minor attachement points so that it can be connected to. The problem is we dont have any space craft that can go there. Orion will but it doesnt have an air lock and is really expensive. I really want to see the Dream Chaser get an air lock module added with robotic arm.

The alternative is to bring a little extra fuel one or twice a year to give the station a boost.The relatively low orbit is certainly not a thing anyones all that concerned with.

The earth does not emit light like the Sun but it does reflect a LOT of light. Since the nearest star is the Sun and the next closes is VERY far away if the Earth is exposed correctly in a picture then no you can NOT see other stars. The light from those stars behind Earth is absolutely tiny compared to the amount of reflected light from the Sun. And of course nobody takes a picture of Earth in space that is adjusted to expose the stars behind it. You would need to hold the exposure for so long that the picture would be pure white from all the light coming from Earth. Do I need to explain how light reflection works? I can.The next closest star besides the Sun is . light years away. Even that light is dim. So when the majority of stars in the background even when on the dark side of earth still have a lot of light in the way. There is so much light pollution from cities the moon from the Sun still etc etc. Your phone screen is going to be brighter than those stars. So unless you are literally in the middle of nowhere with no light sources within miles ALL the other lights around you are so much brighter than the stars many light years away your basic camera phone cannot capture it.,space,d0k8ccd,2,t5_2qh87

6793271,0,t1_d0m6a45,I think Skylon has a decent chance provided that they get the funding they need. Theyve already proven the most difficult technological aspect of the vehicle which are the engine precoolers. They developed a working and very lightweight heat exchanger that cools the airflow using the liquid hydrogen on board allowing the engine to use much lighter alloys and achieve higher compression ratios.Also Skylon has several advantages that allow single stage to orbit to be practical. For one it can use its wings for lift which is more efficient than fighting against gravity directly with the engines. Second since it can use the atmosphere to fuel the engines Skylon can achieve very high specific impulse around  seconds while maintaining high thrust. This allows Skylon to escape a lot of the tyranny of the rocket equation. Finally due to its very lightweight build compared to its size the drag it experiences during reentry is much more effective at slowing the vehicle down which significantly reduces the amount of heat the craft must experience. That results in being able to use a lighter heat shield.Hopefully they dont run into any insurmountable roadblocks because Im a huge fan of the project ,space,d0mb1sc,29,t5_2qh87

Looking at the fossil record just below the irridiumenriched CretaceousPaleogene marker bed there is a clear dropoff of biodiversity in the two million years leading up to the impact.  The meteorite impact represented the final nail in the coffin but dinosaurs and other megafauna were already on their way out and probably would have gone extinct with a million years anyway!The steep decline in biodiversity occurred at the same time as the Deccan Traps volcanic event which flooded much of India with millions of cubic kilometers of lava one of the biggest volcanic events in Earths history!.  The lava intruded into an organicrich basin full of coal petroleum and other organic matter.  As the organic matter heated up it generated and released millions of tons of methane and CO into the atmosphere which triggered a runaway greenhouse gas effect raising sea levels acidifying the oceans significantly raising the global temperatures and causing droughts over much of the planet.Most extinctions in Earths history can also be connected to volcanic events in an organicrich basins.

Dust is lifted pretty efficiently around the seasonal poles and along areas with steep topographic gradients. Strangely the smallest particles are some of the most difficult to lift and require the largest wind speeds. Small dust particles are actually lifted into the air when larger particles bounce back down to the surface and kick them up or aggregates break up. This is actually what I study.

So what happened is this sphere expanded outward and little imperfections in the ball its a big ball globbed together.  The structures started to cool down and their gravity pulled it other structures to form galaxies.  And galaxies contain these turned into the dust clouds youre seeing.  Stars are actually formed inside these clouds the massive gravity of dust particles collapsing in on themselves eventually the ball of dust ignites.Veeerry simple and short explanation for you if you want more wikipedias a great source that puts things in not toomathy terms.

Perhaps the convection zones allow upflowing energy from the supernova in the core to bubble out a little faster just above each zone.Also someone else pointed out that other supernova simulations have some rather significant asymmetry ... where one side of the star erupts before everything else.

After Apollo was the new Project Selene if my memory serves which was a new series of much larger reusable moon landers that would set up lunar bases in the late s. Project Zeus was a nuclear rocket to Mars for the s NERVA engine just a nuclear pileheat engine that steamed out superheated liquid propellant. All of it could have happened. But we turtled up. Also up was the real shuttle which was supposed to be launched Virgin Space style one big plane taking the shuttle up high to launch in midair eliminating the need for a first stage. Budget cuts required NASA to ask for a boost from the Air Force the AF would endorse the shuttle only if it could loft Keyhole spy satellites which would require a huge cargo bay. To accomodate the AF NASA had to toss all the reusable bits of the launch system and create a giant fuel tank and two strapon solid boosters to lift the Keyholes.

Using just the existing Subaru telescope Mike Browns team has put a  year timescale on being able to survey the required fields.Further the gravitational effects of Planet  on your set of probes would be very very very small.  Almost certainly negligible unless you just happened to send one very close to the planet by total luck.  The cost would also be horrendous you could probably build another Subaru dedicated to searching only for this object for the same cost and theyd take longer to build than the  year survey requires anyway followed by decades of travel time to get anywhere near the distance of this object!.  ,space,d1fm3tq,8,t5_2qh87

If you are like me you are executing your civic duty to civilize the world and letting this buffoon tell a class full of people something like this is unacceptable because unlike you your peers may not have the mental capacity to distinguish between times asshats like your professor are talking truth and when they are regurgitating science fiction.   My advice to you is to go back to your telescope photograph the ISS personally and write a sworn affidavit that you had notarized and deliver it to him personally with the class as an audience swearing and attesting that you with your own two eyes saw and subsequently photographed this urban legend.   Ask him to provide empirical datanot speculative jargon proving you wrong.   Then continue to rebut and supplement your presentation as needed.     No need to sacrifice a good argument on this dipshits account.

7210592,0,t3_4e4fe7,Im guessing youre ESL? If im totally honest I cant understand all of what youre asking but Ill try. Gravity as we currently understand it is a distortion of the very fabric of spacetime. A higher amount of gravity acting on an object causes the amount of time that appears to have passed to be lessened. The observation of time passing is a separate phenomenon. We know that gravity actually causes time dilation instead of just changing the observation thereof because of several experiments. One that is fairly well known is the Hafele  Keating Experiment in which atomic clocks were placed in airplanes and flown to a certain altitude where the amount of gravity experienced would be less. The amount of time that had passed on the clock was compared to a clock that was on the ground and the effects were as the theory of relativity predicted. The observation of the clock through looking at it actually has nothing to do with what the clock reads. Also the laws of physics as they are currently accepted fit with observable phenomena in the universe. That is to say we are not aware of situations where the laws of physics dont actually work provided we include relativity in those laws. As for the big bang the passage of time is completely relative. We can only measure time dilation by referring it to an object which is moving at a different speed or in a different gravitational field and so experiences the passage of time differently. There is no absolute passage of time just as there is no absolute volecity only velocity measured with respect to another object,space,d1xsdpg,1,t5_2qh87

7217748,0,t1_d1xnsj7,Hmm. I hear what you are saying but let me try to steer you in the right direction. The midth century space race culminating in a manned surface mission to the Moon was for all practical purposes an extension of the US military and a proxy component of the Cold War. It had little to do with science or exploration and certainly nothing to do with any social benefits as you suggest. Was it related to what we now characterize as American exceptionalism? Sure but this was a very different time. At the beginning of the space race  lets call it Sputnik in  we had only exited WW  years prior. That war was very much still in our mind and lets not forget what happened at the end of World War . Nearly every developed nation in the world had had its infrastructure destroyed manufacturing and otherwise.  The United States was not only barely touched but also had an overwhelming advantage in manufacturing capacity that could be brought to bear due to war manufacturing needs. This resulted in a huge economic boom and the rise of the American manufacturing middle class. Meanwhile youve got Russia who was essentially our own competition. We latch onto Communism as an evil entity to coalesce support and drive to beat them. To the victors go the spoils and we were in a fight to become the new superpower. There were obviously many facets to the Cold War and space was just one. But on the space front specifically They put Sputnik in orbit. Then they put a man in space first. Then they did a spacewalk first. Then the US essentially came from behind and won the race to the Moon  the new higher ground. Apollo was not a case of American exceptionalism. It cemented the concept of American exceptionalism after first germinated in the postWW world economy just a decade prior and briefly tested in the space race by what we saw as our only competition. Exceptionalism  is not really a surprising result from this.  Now back to your other point about race. Apollo was essentially a political and military campaign. Youre flying people to space and to the Moon. Does it not seem obvious to select the best welltrained fighter pilots in these early space missions? I think that should be obvious. Guess who these people were at the time? White males. The civil rights movement was occurring in parallel to all of this  and the fact that only white males were eligible was more an issue of general society circumstance than anything on NASAs part.  In fact the first Black astronaut was selected before we landed on the moon while the civil rights movement was still in progress.  He did not fly but as you probably know Apollo did not last long it was killed and there was a significant space gap from . The first black astronaut to actually fly was selected during this gap and flew  years after it was ended.  So I find your claim that NASA was racist to be disingenuous at best.  If anything they were a symptom of a much larger issue in American society at the time and to be honest looking at history I feel they have always shown themselves to be ahead of the curve as compared to almost every other government agency and most private companies as well random side note but next time youre in the hospital and see the photos of the board of directors through the years take a look at one from the s or s. Spoiler alert almost all white dudes. As a modern example of my point  look at the last two astronaut selections as it relates to gender equality and compare to any other metrics you want on gender equality in our society. ,space,d1ylosc,2,t5_2qh87

From that time onward they would continue at the same pace because they are in the same frame of reference all moving at the same speed. Im not going to spell out every single scenario that you can come up with I solved one for you and gave you the tools to continue on your own. You are not going to come up with some example that breaks special or general relativity. Just take some time to learn it and you wont look like a fool trying to fight one of the best established theories in physics. Going back to your very first question for a minute Ok you have two frames of reference A and B moving at half c in relation to each other. Which one of them experiences faster time?. I want to revisit this because you seem to not like my answers. There is no absolute reference for time or velocity. Time and velocity are relative! You have to ask who has the fastest time according to a certain observer. There is  no huge universal clock that you can compare everyones time to. Time is not the only thing that is changed by velocity either length mass and kinetic energy momentum etc. are also changed when moving with respect to an observer in another reference frame.,space,d1z0eck,2,t5_2qh87

7230531,0,t1_d201dhx,Yes excellent point. That is true and while it can definitely be just seen as quibbling with terms it is an interesting little point of debate about his flight. It does all really depend on how one defines an orbit I guess. If you go with the definition of a single orbit being one complete revolution of a body without taking planetary rotation into account but rather judging by geographic surface locations of launch site and landing point then Gagarins flight fell just short of completing that full revolution since he never did pass beyond the point he lifted off from.According to his flightplan he was actually supposed to land northeast of the Baikonur complex he took off from which by any definition meant he would have achieved a full complete revolution around the Earth but due to the reentry issues I mentioned which almost killed him I might add he still landed northwest of where he took off from which introduces that pesky little discrepancy of the fact that in terms of surface locations he circled the Earth and touched down just short of where he took off from.   ,space,d2023cm,6,t5_2qh87

For example you buy stuff that was made in a country and that is transported to the US by a large cargo ship. This cargo ship can go from that country to yours because the US Navy protects those routes to avoid piracy. The Armed Forces played a massive part in helping people in places who suffered from disasters with some pretty massive humanitarian and rescue missions being carried out.A bunch of nations depend on America for their protection and its thanks to this protection that we are able to remain as their number  trade partner. Thats not something that you can count up as profit because strangely enough politics and economics are a bit more complicated than adding stuff up.Id also like to point out the consequences  imagining it goes linearly getting rid of  of the military budget would mean the layoff of  thousand people contractors notwithstanding. Good luck getting those people working in the newly developed engineering heavy space sector. Thats not something anyone wants.Honestly people tend to think the government is incompetent  thats probably true. It doesnt mean theyre stupid though. So far most people agree that there is too much money spent on the military.

If a puddle forms and gets lit up by the engine igniting you get a very big boom. Also ignition heading back up into the engine an go quite badly. Idk if its what they did there but back in the day youd use a hypergolic starting slug two hypergolic chemicals such as hydrazine and nitric acid that instantly ignite on contact inject nitric acid into the oxygen fuel line and hydrazine into the RP line and when the come into contact in the chamber they ignite. Of course theyre immediately followed by LOX and RP which then are ignited by the hypergolic fireball already in the engine.Edit the Saturn V used triethylborane ignition. This sprays a bit of TEAtriethylaluminumTEB mixture which ignites on contact with the air or with oxidizer. As does the falcon  ignitionrelight starter. Hence the green flash emission spectra of the boron in the fueltea and teb are basically a metal atom loosely holding on to three ethyl hydrocarbon groups ready to let go of them at a moments notice.,space,d2vbkb1,13,t5_2qh87

If the star becomes heavier than this most likely by matter falling onto it it will collapse all the way to a black hole we think. Theres a lot of uncertainty in the value of the limit though because we dont understand the way neutrondegenerate matter behaves very well.

After about  years redshift of  it cooled enough for atoms to form which caused the optical depth to plummet and thus allowed the photons that are now the Cosmic Microwave Background to free stream. Then nothing much happened in the universe until the first stars galaxies and black holes started to form. At which point a ton of UV and Xray photons were emitted which gradually reionized the universe. This happened at a redshift of about . What you see in this movie is a simulation of that process.

We could start flinging comets and what not at it especially ones rich in ammonia but if weve the kind of resources to do it at that scale were looking at a becasue we can project and not a becasue we need to And that still doenst solve all the lovely problems brought by no magnetic field. Unless youre fond of cancer and hoping the sun doenst randomly decide to give everyone on the planet a base case of radiation poisoning thats an issue.For the effort put into terraforming mars we could plop a space habitat somewhere in the solar system with decent radiation shielding and not need to deal with the low gravity fucking with us. ,space,d3e9tqo,0,t5_2qh87

Not saying its impossible just prohibitive considering both the initial cost and the fact that such a structure would almost certainly be a net loss in terms of resources produced vs. used.Venus is a more viable terraforming candidate IMO. Convertingremoving the greenhouse materials to reduce planetary temperature drastically is a HUGE challenge but certainly more viable than creating a planetary magnetic field.Of course theres always the old fashioned way to terraform planets launch a variety of biological and artificial  though were not quite there yet life forms repeatedly until something takes hold. Just because conditions on a planet are inhospitable to life as we know it doesnt mean that theyre automatically inhospitable to ALL life and as anyone with a basic understanding of science knows an environment changes as life evolves. An alien biology might pollute its environment in a way which CREATES favorable conditions for human life.IMO The greatest barrier to our understanding of extraterrestrial life is perhaps the human bias we apply to our understanding of life itself. We are an astronomically ha! small speck in the universe yet we stick to the belief that our existence and awareness are the standard of what is possible beyond. Mathematically were more likely the exception of possibility rather than the rule.

SourceOf course standard video is displayed at about  frames per second as its the lowest frame rate human perceive as normal on screen at least.The exposure in my last photo was  full seconds. But its a balance if my camera lens had a bigger aperture I could cut that time down because the wider aperture opening would mean more light coming in.Think about how your pupils become smaller in day and larger at night this is to compensate for proper exposure settings for your brain to perceive. Lets say that lowering your brains frame rate down to  is too absurd and instead youd rather go the route of having gigantic pupils to allow more light in more quickly.

No denying the huge shadow on a significant area but I was talking about the stuff the fertile minds of our ancestors would make up to explain the belt and the events related to moons gravity fucking with the belt if there was a belt as they sat out nights staring up at the skies and not about the advantagesdisadvantages of having a belt per se.Such asgt The Polynesian islanders of the Pacific Ocean said that the moon was a creator goddess named Hina and that women called wahines were her representatives on earth. In ancient Persia the moon was Metra the world mother.gt For some people the moon had a destructive aspect. The Aztecs of Mexico called it Mictecacuiatl and believed that it traveled through the night skies hunting out victims to consume. The Maori people of New Zealand referred to the moon as man eater. Africans and Semitic peoples of the ancient Near East also feared this terrifying aspect of the moon.gt In certain cultures the moon had a gentler association with death. Some ancient Greek sects thought that the moon was the home of the dead and early Hindus believed that the souls of the dead returned to the moon to await rebirth. The moon could even symbolize birth and death at the same time. The Tartars of Central Asia called it the Queen of Life and Death.gt In mythology the moon is often female a goddess who may be paired with a sun god. The Incas of South America told of a brother and sister the moon maiden and the sun man who were the ancestors of the royal Incas. In the Mayan writing system a symbol showing the moon goddess seated inside the moon was used before the names of noble women. The Greeks associated the moon with the goddess Artemis sister of Apollo. They also called it Hecate Cynthia and Selene. The Roman name for the moon was Luna. Native American names for the moon include the Old Woman Who Never Dies and the Eternal One.gt Sometimes however the moon is male. The Inuit of Greenland picture the moon as a hunter sitting in front of his igloo. Norse mythology speaks of a moon son and a sun daughter and Mrs. Sun and Mr. Moon are part of German folklore.gt Other legends explain the appearance of the moon whose mottled surface has suggested various shapes and identities. The man in the moon is one common interpretation thought to have originated from the biblical book of Numbers which describes a man carrying a load of sticks. People have also interpreted the shapes as frogs and toads and rabbitsgt In China and Japan the lunar rabbit is said to mix a potion that gives immortality.gt The Moon in Myths. A Native American myth says that the sun and moon are a chieftain and his wife and that the stars are their children. The sun loves to catch and eat his children so they flee from the sky whenever he appears. The moon plays happily with the stars while the sun is sleeping. But each month she turns her face to one side and darkens it as the moon wanes to mourn the children that the sun succeeded in catching.gt The Efik Ibibio people of Nigeria in West Africa also say that the sun and the moon are husband and wife. Long ago they lived on the earth. One day their best friend flood came to visit them bringing fish reptiles and other relatives. Flood rose so high in their house that they had to perch on the roof. Finally he covered the house entirely so the sun and moon had to leap into the sky.gt According to the Greek myth of Endymion and Selene the moon Selene fell in love with a handsome young king named Endymion and bore him  daughters. One version of the story says that Selene placed Endymion in eternal sleep to prevent him from dying and to keep him forever beautiful.gt In a myth of the Luyia people of Kenya in East Africa the sun and moon were brothers. The moon was older bigger and brighter and the jealous sun picked a fight with him. The two wrestled and the moon fell into mud which dimmed his brightness. God finally made them stop fighting and kept them apart by ordering the sun to shine by day and the mudspattered moon to shine by night to illuminate the world of witches and thieves.,space,d3py0e4,1,t5_2qh87

7777473,0,t3_4luk7r,How long it would take largely depends on whether you want to bring him back again. If all we had to do was land  astronaut in a spacesuit on the surface we could probably do so relatively quickly by repurposing things that are currently being built like the Dragon or Orion capsule. You could keep the vehicle very light since you would only need life support to keep the astronaut alive for the  day trip to the moon and fuel to land. Getting someone there in a year seems like it would be doable.If you want to keep him alive for a while or bring him back home it becomes exponentially more complicated. Now you are looking at landing a  ton vehicle on the moon similar to the Apollo Lunar Module. This vehicle would have to be designed from scratch since nothing like it currently exists. And you would either need a big rocket  SLS is scheduled for a launch in November  or you would have to launch a spacecraft and a booster separately and have them meet in orbit. A mission like this would need time for development and testing of technology.

7801764,1,t1_d3sv9je,Yes an eight year period allows for enough research and development derived from the  mission. As for the worthiness of sending a crew to die there well they would probably be dead anyway if they were to return from Mars back to Earth. The radiation dosage will be so high that they would technically be traveling to their own graves due to the mission duration and current shield technology. Overall I think this whole Mars mission is a stepping stone to deep space exploration. Relying on probes and unmanned missions can be the safe way to go but can only get us so far.

For a few quick examples the current definition in use only classifies objects in our solar system as dwarf planets  any such object outside of our solar system would be classified as a planet under the current definition. The person who led the charge for demoting Pluto wanted it demoted mostly because he was afraid of kids having to learn the names of s of planets. The issue there is that.. well how many elements are on the periodic table? Just because theyre there doesnt mean they must be memorized I certainly didnt memorize them all. Then theres the issue of the whole clearing the path silliness where people say well Pluto crosses the path of Neptune.. so it hasnt cleared its path. Under that same logic Neptune isnt a planet either.. because it crosses the path of Pluto. I could go on but to put it all simply the move to demote Pluto was political. It didnt advance any understanding or clear up any confusion in fact it creates confusion etc. I have no issues with calling Ceres and the others planet either.,space,d4fjqtm,1,t5_2qh87

The three CD players together stabilize motion around just one axis the axis corresponding to their total angular momentum.  If all three of the CD players are oriented inward this is a little hard to describe then this axis should point in the direction you specify.To best stabilize the flashlight you would stack the CD players together then tape them to the back end of the flashlight such that their axis of rotation is along the flashlights length.  You could then move the flashlight in any direction or spin it about its axis of symmetry which wouldnt change the direction it points.

Sequential developments as the term implies need to be done in steps and thus delays in any step can have cascading consequences for later steps.Anything that has already been done can overwhelmingly be reduced to parallel steps so I would say NASA could definitely put humans back on the Moon within  years with a blank check.  I would also say that reasonable upscaling of anything that has already been done likewise so perhaps putting more people on the Moon than before  five at a time rather than two.  As well as some much larger space station perhaps at L  maybe a person facility.Anything that has fundamentally never been done will involve a lot of sequential development.  I dont think  years is enough time for human Mars landing even with a blank check but I do think it is sufficient for a human Mars flyby and a human Venus flyby. ,space,d4zy3ah,23,t5_2qh87

Ill paint you a short picture.The models are a blend of lots of different theories each describing a different era of the universes life. In total I imagine nearly all areas of physics end up being used.The data used is equally as vast. Information from the Hubble. Information on the Cosmic Microwave Background. Information from particle colliders like CERN. And so on and so on.This is still an area of very active research and the picture changes all the time. All the models give a similar layout for the chronology of the universe though.I can recommend these books if you want to learn more. Im sure you can find them somewhere   Liddle A.

If you overlay two pieces of film you just get an additive image like a ghost but if you use that matte you can visually cut a hole in the image so that when you print the layer over the top of it you get the impression that its a solid element in front of the background.This is very difficult to do with reflective objects because they bounce the bluescreenwhite light matte all over them and require proper environments in order to properly reflect them.  Youd need to do passes of a reflective object catching the reflections and then matte that on top of the first model pass and then shoot a matte for that element as well.  Something like the command module reflecting the Lunar surface would be probably  different layers of film at a minimum and would be heavily artifacted from the process.

The first stage after it separates from the second stage and payload is only around  tons dry. The lighter the payload the more fuel they have to do all the burns necessary to land. For the final landing burn even with a single engine firing at its lowest throttle setting  the rocket makes too much thrust to hover like a helicopter. Spacex has to do what is called a suicide burn in which the computers and radar precisely time the burn of the engines so that the stage has zero velocity at zero altitude. More fuel in the tanks means a slower descent and the timing doesnt have to be so precise. ,space,d5go7ij,10,t5_2qh87

Moreover when an apohele is closest to us it is presenting us the night side of the asteroid.Though theyre hard to see via reflected sunlight the apoheles still give off infrared light.I would very much like to see several WISE . scopes at Sun Earth Lagrange  SEL. The present NEOWISE is hard to keep cold it has a  K heat source taking up nearly half the sky.From the point of view of a scope at SEL the sun earth and moon all dwell in the same small patch of sky. A small shade could shield an infrared scope from all three of these major heat sources. That would leave most of the  K sky the scope could radiate heat into. Unlike Chicxulub sized rocks it is plausible to deflect smaller rocks like a Tunguska or Chelyabinsk. If an orbital scope gave us advance warning for a city killer the ROI could be in the trillions.,space,d5udsnq,2,t5_2qh87

8566717,0,t1_d6cdpyi,In general no. You have to look at galaxys that are very far away before gravitaional lensing comes into play and when it does its not because of the galaxy itself. The lensing is created by a closer galaxy or group of galaxies bending the light from a more distant galaxy. There are some great examples though.Here is an excellent example. The eliptical galaxy in the foregroundcenter is lensing the galaxy behind it that is much farther away. The lensing causes the light to bend around the eliptical galaxy and we see this as a result.There are other phenomenon at play however that do cause galaxies to appear different than reality. Take this view of Andromeda. The closest neighbor to us. It looks normal to you and I but in reality the light that originated from the farther point of the galaxy has taken a bit longer to make it to us than the light from the closest point of Andromeda. The arms at the back are  light years away from the arms in the front. So the light that came to us from the back of the galaxy came  years later. In this time things could move and look different. But then again...  years is negligible for the most part at galactic scales.Fun fact Elliptical galaxies are the most massive and oldest galaxies in the universe. They also contain the largest black holes in the universe.,space,d6cf3oo,5,t5_2qh87

8592505,0,t3_4xgp4f,.  The der Spiegel article is here translated. The project website referred to is here but its not particularly informative.  . HAARPS uses radial velocity to detect planets which can be affected by stellar activity you might see in a late Mdwarf like this but astronomers are pretty used to dealing with that by now and Im of the impression from the way the Pale Red Dot page is worded that theyve got a lot of cumulative data to back it up sort of like how the researchers at CERN had to wait to reach a certain level of certainty before they would claim a Higgs Boson detection.. Astronomers are a little wary of detections in the alpha cen system though there have been disputed detections in the past for Alpha Cen B.  The hesitation comes not just from the uncooperative stars but because researchers can get a little too excited about a promising result too early and the media can oversell it.. The Virtual Planetary Laboratory has a crude tool for calculating habitable zones.  Proxima Cens would generously be between . and . AU or between a . and . day orbit although the VPL site does put an inner limit for a truly Earthlike planet at around . AU depending on mass to avoid runaway greenhouses... but Id guess the discovery paper is just going by a simple HZ measure.  I see the wiki has estimates supposedly taken from the Alien Worlds mini series and a proceedings paper... estimates will depend on the assumed values for the star which tend to be pretty shit for flaring variable things tbh still I am not sure how they got the orbits assuming they just used Keplers third law like I did.... The habitability issue lies on whether a tidally locked planet as this would be is likely to create a magnetic field to protect a planets atmosphere and any life on it.  A larger planet may be a better bet we dont know the size yet unless I missed something in the article.a. An aside Im sure the commentator was joking in this thread but this is not the same sort of radiation as that which lingers after nuclear war..

8602350,0,t1_d6gsdch,A lot of people are giving you really technical explanations about this so Ill make an eli version.So you want to get a geostationary orbit. That implies a few things first you want your orbit to be circular. Second you want it to take as long to go around the earth as the earth takes to rotate. Third you want it going in the direction that the earth is rotating.One thing about orbits is that the higher you get the longer it takes to go around so as height increases time to make one lap around the earth also increases. That means that you have you launch your spaceship high enough that if you had a circular orbit at that altitude it would take exactly as long as the earth takes to go around. Here is a picture an artist made of where all the satellites around Earth are. If you look at that really big ring going diagonal on the picture thats a geostationary orbit. Its a really useful place to be in so a lot of satellites will be launched there. Its the only spot where your orbital period will be exactly  hours if you have a circular orbit. So we have to be circular at exactly that high. But the thing is the satellite now has a whole lot farther that it has to travel if it wants to make an entire circuit. Think about it like if you were an ant with a friend of yours crawling around a grape while you were crawling around a watermelon you have to cover a whole lot more distance if youre walking around the watermelon. That means that if you want to get around the watermelon as fast as the other ant goes around a grape you have to go faster.Thats whats going on here you do get some amount of velocity from the earth going around but you arent going fast enough to go all the way around the earth in  hours when youre as high as you need to be for a geostationary orbit.,space,d6gvyvu,1,t5_2qh87

8605575,0,t1_d6gzf0n,Rocket launch economics do not work the way you suggest. What a customer cares about is the price to launch the specific payload along with reliability schedule ease of working with the company etc. To be able to cover a fair bit of the market companies have two choices they can either come up with a way to vary the performance of their rocket  typically with strapon boosters  or they can decide to build a big one and then throw away some of the available payload for lighter sats. SpaceX decided to go with the latter route but instead of throwing away the available payload they choose to use it to land the first stage and hope to refly it. It is true that nobody has actually tried this in the past but thats not a good indicator because there hasnt been a lot of competition in the launch market recently. I agree that Musk companies tend to be really good at marketing but I dont buy the PR gimmick angle because there isnt really a good reason for SpaceX to waste a ton of time on that kind of PR their customers are communication companies and the government NASA and DOD and none of those are sensitive to PR.

We have a tremendous though dwindling stock of fossil fuels thats driven our industrialization and technological development for the last couple centuries. That would mean that another planet to have the same abundancy of fuel would have to have had life for long enough that those stores of oil coal etc. could develop without any of the life on it learning to exploit those stocks until they have enough to fuel the sort of technological boom weve had.Different paths are of course possible but ours would cut down the number of candidates even further. Then those societies that do have abundant energy sources have to actually use them well and not run out before they can develop other methods of energy generation which we have nuclear solar etc. but have not implemented en masse yet and they have to decide that spaceflight is worth their time. And depending on what sorts of fuels they use for example many of our liquidfueled rockets use kerosene and liquid oxygen they may need a nonrenewable resource to fly them until they develop something else.So you have to have a society that has the intelligence the natural resources and the willingness to accomplish longterm space travel and colonization.

Its just an incredible machine and its about th the pricekg of the shuttle which launched over  times. If well pay for the shuttle than well pay for a much cheaper more capable SLS. Ive seen mods at SpaceX argue against your stance. This topic polarizes people without seeing the grey. The SLS is evil or its the best. No in between.What the SLS does is give us that incredible performance that we MUST HAVE to perform certain missions. Currently no rocket can give you the capability that the SLS can. Want to land on Europa? Too bad you cant. You cant strap a billion onto a payload put it in the Falcon Heavy and get the payload that the SLS can. It doesnt work that way. You pay a premium for the SLS but the launch cost is a minuscule amount of the total cost. Europa Clipper will cost over . billion and likely over . billion by the time it is done. A  million flight that allows it to increase its mass by a factor of x and cut . years off of what the Falcon Heavy can do is one hell of a deal.

With the mass that it has it likely wouldnt have suffered the risk of losing its water in the way that Mars did and with it sitting where it is in the goldilocks zone provided it doesnt have a thick atmosphere like Venus it could have kept a lot of its water too. The problem is there are too many unknowns right now  atmospheres can vary so so much as we know all too well in our own system.In regards to the planet being tidally locked that doesnt necessarily kill all chances of life  interesting stuff can go on in the boundary between day and night especially with weather etc and theres still plenty of surface area for cool stuff to happen.That being said from my point of view what seems more interesting might be that there could be other planets in the system. There could be a smaller  . Earth Mass planet towards the outer edge of the goldilocks zone for example. Where theres one planet theres usually many.

That gas giant probably doesnt have a waterice layer relevant to this.gt The CHO ternary phase diagram at high pressure is of paramount importance for planetary science. HO and CH not necessarily in their intact molecular forms are the major constituents of giant planets such as Neptune and Uranus where pressure can reach hundreds of GPa. Moreover large icy satellites e.g. Ganymede Callisto and Titan and comets all contain water ice mixed with a number of volatiles such as CH and CO at pressures of up to a few GPa. The press release has a model for Jupiters moon Europa but its probably wrong about that too the pressure in Europas ocean isnt high enough to support carbonic acid at the new published figure . GPa. Europa isnt mentioned in the scientific paper. I think the authors are talking about the much thicker solid water ice mantles in the other moons listed not Europa.,space,d7coejv,2,t5_2qh87

The astronaut then rotated the valve to open the vent. I think there were different flow rates at least two? depending upon how far the vent was turned.The OPS pack was only regulated in the sense of reducing the high pressure of the stored oxygen to something more usable there was only one flow setting and flow rate was controlled by the suit vent valve. The primary use of the OPS pack was in the event that the LM couldnt dock with the CSM as the PLSS backpacks were left on the moon. Im sure there were studies done on how large a hole in a space suit one of the OPS pack could compensate for as studies were done for a hole punched in the CM.An OPS pack was worn by an astronaut who recovered the film canisters from the SM SIM bay on one of the missions as a back up to the life support umbilical cord.

8996317,0,t3_53hgzp,This is the best image of Alpha Centauri A and B captured by Hubble.        Alpha Centauri A is to the left B is to the right. What wasnt identified in the image is that appears to be Proxima Centauri to the upper left.  If you observe A does appear to be larger than B and that is a confirmed fact.  Wikipedia has an image of A B and Proxima taken by an amateur astronomer with a digital camera. Proxima is a clear dot versus the smeared shape of the stars beyond.        Here is a guy that has a really good analysis page and he ended up with the conclusion that Proxima Centauri was  to  certain to NOT have a Jupitersize planet or smaller. That was in Feb. of this year several months before the ESO announcement. It is worth a read because it details the difficulty trying to determine if there is a planet around Proxima Centauri.        One big problem is how much light A and B throw off in comparison to the reflected light from a planet plus Proxima is a red dwarf with not much light. Also it hasnt been proven yet that Proxima is part of the Alpha Centauri system. There is still an opinion it is a partially captured system and that it will escape the Alpha Centauri system.    The big telescopes are for deep space observation meaning focal distance really deep in space. You can get the same effect by picking up a binoculars and looking at something across a field in high detail then looking down at your shoes trying to focus on them.  The focal range isnt there. The search for higher detail images of exoplanets is rising to a top priority for astronomy and that means focal distances of around  lightyears. It isnt the raw focusing power like James Webb. It is about magnification at shorter focal distances. Plus there is a lot more than optical light to focus on. There is Xray IR and UV.  This is what TESS is designed for multiple telescopes designed to search for exoplanets. Launch possibly in .  Deep space astronomy is important but the interest for searching for exoplanets is exploding.    ,space,d7t7ure,-3,t5_2qh87

Probes can outlast their primary mission duration and return huge amounts of useful data for decades manned missions cannot.Not to mention that making better and better robotic probes means better and better robots on Earth where they have real direct applications.

More than  are larger than a softball. Those numbers in a space the size of Earths orbital back yard is much worse than  the mass of our Moon spread around a ring between Mars and Jupiter.Looking back from a vantage where humans are  for  on attempts to get through the belt and modern computerassisted astronomy has estimated the mass of the asteroid belt to the kilogram and NASA itself estimates the risks of a collision during transit of our belt at one in a billion... sure the idea that it would be a threat seems silly. But Voyager I went up just  years after Pioneer . NASAs PR shows that they were very worried about it. And their Voyager FAQ saysgt While the largest of the asteroids were known and their orbits charted many of the asteroids moved in unknown orbits. Although the risk of a spacecraft colliding with a charted asteroid was negligible there was no way to estimate how many particles the size of a grain of sand might be present in the asteroid belt to collide with the spacecraft and seriously damage it. From Pioneer First to Jupiter Saturn and Beyond NASA SP  emphasis mineThey literally did not have the technology or the techniques necessary to properly assess the risk of the transit and they were quite naturally concerned about their lack of knowledge.,space,d816rso,1,t5_2qh87

I understand your viewpoint but hopefully I can adequately put into words why I disagree in a way that doesnt come off as...selfish? Not seflish. Im thinking of a mix of pragmatic and flippant but I dont think theres a word for that.Anyway my point is that theres no inherent value to anything in the universe theres no central universal...thing that cares if anything exists or not. Everything in the universe from the stars in the sky to the microbes in Mars lithosphere are only so beautiful and fascinating because humans are around to feel that way. Arguably there could be an alien species that feels the same but there could just as easily be one that thinks theyre disgusting.By getting rid of humans youd literally be getting rid of the only  guaranteed way for the universe to even be beautiful. Theres no way to even be sure that concept exists without us. Further I deeply believe that most humans are good at their core and were finally beginning to make real progress in our shamble towards the day where that goodness shows more brightly than the ill.That being said I do feel the press of time for us to reach that day we are in danger and I dont think that colonizing Mars is a direct solution or backup plan.

The original point of discussion in this thread was What would you do with all that money after a certain point? You said it was morally responsible to invest it. I wasnt contesting that. I was contesting whether it was the best use of funds at that point. If someone has all the money they needwant and are just playing with funds ie reinvesting them to get more funds it would be more moral and a more productive use of funds to directly reinvest that wealth back into the community either directly or indirectly via a reputable charity organization. It sounds like were on the same page about investments and savings not necessarily being evil and I support sound investment strategies. Im asking which is a better use of funds after you are considered properly loaded? That may be entirely subjective but I was under the impression you were pushing that investments in existing companies are more productive than the alternatives I was suggesting.

As some other people have mentioned setting the white balance to capture the true color is something that camerasphotographers have trouble with even here on earth. Our eyes or brain automatically adjust for white balance in real life thats why things illuminated under an incandescent lamp still look white even though the color is actually skewed towards yellow and then you could change the illumination to a bright bluewhite LED light and your brain would again autoadjust and white still looks white blue looks blue red looks red etc. I think the most accurate pictures colorwise of Mars are those that include the color calibration targets on the rover since if we were there our eyes would adjust so that red green and blue look like red green and blue regardless of the actual color temperature of the ambient light to a certain extent of course.

I know a lot of people born in the month of April and the only two remotely similar are friends of mine and naturally people with similar tastes and compatible personalities tend to be friends.

This of course usually changes after high school when most people drift apart.

This steam created an environment that was potentially volatile and flammable.  Since the liquid oxygen was not properly vented and diluted this brought about an opportunity for a spark.  To many viewer eyes and assumptions the video shows a clear possibly overcast Florida day.  The weather that day was actually severe in the Cape Canaveral area with lots of thunder and lightning.  So much so that locals didnt know if the explosion sound was anything else but thunder.  The video does not show this severe weather.  In the much examined video by civilians few mention the weather conditions since they were unaware and assumed clear skies given the video.  A black object is shown flying toward the launch pad just before the explosion.  I believe the black object was debris caught in the current of electricity that hit the launch tower.  The Space X rocket was not hit by a sinister agent from ULA.  The is was simply an accident of fueling on a dangerous day they wouldve never done with real astronauts.

In  I had a high school job building computers and the little computer company I work for out of Dallas Texas won the side by side competition and lowest bidder to refresh all computers at Johnson Space Center  Houston. We won speed tests against Dell Compaq HP and Gateway computers in the Spring of .  So at the age of  I had full access to every building on the JSC campus.  We took away their Windows . computers and installed the amazing Windows  computers.  I was in Building  replacing computers when the joint RussianUSA flight was having their pictures taken.  I was able to talk to them for a few minutes while they waited.    I was given patches pictures and swag galore by almost everyone I was in contact with as did everyone else that worked that project.  I gave most of the items from almost  years ago to my Secret Reddit Santa last year.  He was a  yr old kid in NY that had an interest in Space.  I have a  x  cut of the  layers of the space suit fabric.   I was able to go into Mission Control with armed guard for about  minutes to replace a computer.   We were there a few months after the filming of the Apollo  movie.  All of the Zero Gravity scenes were filed in  second bursts on the Vomit Comet.  Working at the Landing Strip was pretty damn amazing at .  Watching all these training jets and some Fs fly around shaking all the blinds was rather cool.

9297694,0,t3_57r8se,I think it has to do with the nature of the achievement.Remember most people belong to multiple levels of tribes.  You might have a local city or region a nation a political or religious grouping and humanity as a whole.  If a China does something thats a first for them but not for other nations then most of the people excited are going to associated with China.  People in other nations who look at things on a national tribal level wont have a big reason to get excited because of tribalism.  People who look at things on a humanrace level wont have a big reason to get excited because the second time to do something is never as exciting as the first.  But if China goes out and does something totally groundbreaking then people while still not having a nationallevel incentive to get excited would have a humanrace level to do so.  And I think youd see more international excitement around it for that reason.  Thats one reason behind the space race in the first place.  When the USSR or America made some groundbreaking milestone they could get the whole world interested in it.  While simply achieving what the other had already achieved only got them prestige with their own citizens.,space,d8ujse9,1,t5_2qh87

Even if it did create a spacetime warp it does not give us a FTL warp engine.Nonscientific types heard the word warp and went nuts. They thought oh a warp drive is very soon. They failed to realize that warp requires about  advanced technologies that we dont understand before its even plausible. At the end of the day if the EmDrive works itll certainly get us to explore the entire solar system.

9405135,0,t3_59fzrz,Explanation gtWhat created these unusually long shadows on Saturns rings? The dark shadows  visible near the middle of the image  extend opposite the Sun and given their length stem from objects having heights up to a few kilometers. The long shadows were unexpected given that the usual thickness of Saturns A and B rings is only about  meters. After considering the choppy but elongated shapes apparent near the Bring edge however a leading theory has emerged that some kilometersized moonlets exist there that have enough gravity to create even larger vertical deflections of nearby small ring particles. The resulting ring waves are called propellers named for how they appear individually. It is these coherent groups of smaller ring particles that are hypothesized to be casting the long shadows. The featured image was taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft currently orbiting Saturn. The image was captured in  near Saturns equinox when sunlight streamed directly over the ring plane and caused the longest shadows to be cast.nasa.gov,space,d98610e,3,t5_2qh87

9692472,0,t1_da7s3o8,Well famously an earlier paper talked about pushing against the quantum vacuum or even worse the quantum vacuum virtual plasma. The latter is a made up term doesnt really correspond to anything in the actual literature.The conceptual problem is that the vacuum is a well defined thing in QFT and most importantly its a unique state with zero momentum. It doesnt make any sense to talk about pushing against the vacuum. You could talk about generating a reaction by creating photons but thats very different from a reactionless drive which is not consistent with QFT. QFT has the concept of conservation of momentum owing to the fact that there is a symmetry under spatial translations.The paper youve linked Im seeing for the first time but it looks like theyre making the exact same mistakes. They say the vacuum as the ultimate dump comprises of photons. The vacuum is not a dump and it is not comprised of photons. Furthermore its obviously a major red flag when a paper starts throwing out all kinds of new definitions of basic entities in physics What is the vacuum What is the photon What is inertia when the relationship between all these things is definitionally important in physics. A competent theorist would explain their new idea by relating it to what is already established and understood not redefine a lot of preexisting terms in incorrect andor meaningless ways.Also a photon is just a minimum quantum disturbance in the electromagnetic field. It doesnt actually consist of anything but a pattern of oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. So theres no way to be expelling momentum via photons without disturbances in those fields and the usual EM interactions. You cant just say you have two that cancel each other out completely but that somehow still exist to carry momentum.,space,da7swwf,1,t5_2qh87

9728033,0,t3_5efrco,These space probes are powered by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators.  These have a lump of a radioactive material in them that produces heat as it decays.  This heat is turned into electricity by thermocouples.Because the fuel decays the power output of the RTG decreases over time.  For example the RTGs on the Voyager probes produced . less power after  years than they did when the probes were launched.  The material the thrermocouples are made of will also degrade over time gradually reducing their ability to convert the decay heat into electricity.I cant find any info on RTGs capable of being refueled as the fuel is solid and the RTG is sealed basically welded shut when its built.  However NASA is working on developing new RTGs which use different materials for the thermocouples that wont degrade as fast leading to the RTG as a whole potentially having a long enough practical lifespan to be reused for multiple missions.source  mainly the Wikipedia page on RTGs,space,dac6ylq,2,t5_2qh87

Nothing actually holds them up and a sideways push cant create an upward force. You dont push on a block and expect it to float upwards instead. Accelerative forces only add to the direction of application and objects in the absence of a force move in a straight line at constant velocity forever. gtAnd as it accelerates downwards the direction of downwards changesThe force of gravity actually pulls things inwards towards the Earths centre of mass. You fall inwards and as youve implied downwards is relative. The object definitely falls inwards for reasons already explained. gtThis is how it avoids hitting the ground. I dunno what you dont get about this or how you picture things just falling forever and not ever running out of meters to decrease.So you dont get the sphere example at all?

9868677,0,t1_datte2c,gt Why are scientists so hellbent of finding water on other planetsmoons asteroids? Are we searching for life on asteroids?. Sure water is crucial for life as WE know it. But we are talking about ET lifeforms. Why does water equal life? Is this determined somewhere as a universal rule or is there another reason? It seems odd to base the search ET life on our necessities and rules and impose them onto unknown lifeforms.Its called anthropocentrism. Carbon and water have some considerably unique chemical quantities so assuming the same kind of biochemistry is actually moderately wellgrounded.Besides water is a universal rocket fuel. Crack it and we can produce hydrolox fuel pair oxygen or hydrogen peroxide as desired just add electricity.gtProbes satellites and perhaps future spaceships travelling through our solar system tend to be going fast. I dont know the exact speed but lets say its about   kmh. What determines this speed? Is it the same for all crafts travelling in our solar system andor in a certain direction. In other words what determines the speed limit? And how is this different for interstellar I mean out of solar system travel of spacecraft.Orbital mechanics are a very complex subject suffice it to say its like passing baseballs between two people on trains moving in different directions. With the exception of ion thrusters continuous pathetically weak thrust and gravity assists deflecting the baseball off a moving wall were basically tossing spacecraft away from Earth using massive rockets. Ultimately the rockets are the key limiter to how much we can accelerate the spacecraft specifically the size the available taxpayer money their efficiency and the dead mass maximum deltav of reaction motors e.g. rockets is set by the Tsiolkovsky equation. No there is no hard number. Also note that barring gravity assists the spacecraft is going to slow down as it gets further from the Sun converting its kinetic energy into potential energy and unless it is accelerated past escape velocity eventually it will reach a velocity of  and then start falling back towards the Sun the Earth does the same semiannually as it reaches the apohelion.Welcome to Orbital Mechanics .

9899799,0,t1_daxwwy0,Basically its because getting into orbit doesnt just mean going up it means going sideways really fast.  The up part of it is the smallest and easiest part of a launch.For example the ISS is orbiting the Earth at about  km up.  At that altitude the force of gravity is over  as strong as it is on the surface.  It is constantly being pulled down toward the center of the Earth. The reason is doesnt just fall back down to the surface is that it is moving sideways so fast that although it is being pulled down towards the Earth its moving so fast that it constantly misses it.The speed needed for orbit is tremendous about  mph or . kmsecond or mach .  Thats the real reason it takes a huge rocket to send something into orbit.  Thats also the reason you see the curved path in the image.  It goes up to get above the thickest part of the atmosphere but it arcs over and goes sideways to build up a ton of speed.,space,daxytfh,2,t5_2qh87

9970993,0,t1_db722h5,Okay so ignoring the fact that the particular case youre talking about doesnt betray their personal feelings about any particular minorities racial discrimination is not an indicator of hatred toward a race.For instance the management decision at that point in time may have been made with the thought that a black tenant would be off putting for future prospective tenants and was purely a business decision.  Absolutely morally bankrupt and pretty gross but not necessarily motivated by hatred.Its dangerous to make the leap from He was a named defendant in a lawsuit against his fathers company for discrimination in  to he hates minorities without defining a direct linkage from one to the other.

High level people in any organization are likely to find new things to manage and so in the end there is no net savings. In fact you would spend more on all the relocation costs. It would only make sense to incur those costs if there was an actual savings. See this It cost the government  billion to relocate military people and projects to eventually save some money on facility costs.You also have to take into account that much of the work the government does is actually done by private contractors whose contracts would likely mean they would be paid even if you closed up the departments.I didnt take the time to look up the numbers for NASA and NOAA but Im going to guess such a relocation would not net enough savings to actually be worth the costs of doing such a move.,space,db8ioh8,2,t5_2qh87

Youd either have to have tons in terms of weight of film or they would have to advance film technology by decades and then simply not tell anyone.  This gets harder once they moved to normal framerates in later moon missions which means theyd have to have  times what was already impossible for the tech at the time.Sure could NASA have invested all of their money and resources into this one thing to somehow make an impossible technology for the tech level possible?  Sure.  However thats just arguing assumptions.  Meanwhile they had something that was entirely possible with the technology of the time  just hard to do  which was getting to the moon.But to try and claim that theyd advance film technology by decades just because its NASA and theyre smart at figuring problems out  thats not just hard to do but its impossible with the technology that they had on hand.

By property of converging lenses all images are always inverted upside down onto the CCD. Your software then corrects this before it becomes the image you see in your gallery app by creating a updown mirrored copy. So it takes an inverted image and then inverts it.This is the same way your eyes and brain work. Your eyes have tiny converging lenses projecting upside down images onto your retina. Your brain then inverts the image for you so youre not seeing the world upside down. Whats really neat is that your brain can be retrained to reprocess these images differently as well. For example if for some reason you started walking upside down all the time i.e. seeing everything upside down it would take about  days for your brain to learn to stop inverting images to look normal again to you.,space,dbv9ajc,26,t5_2qh87

10218130,0,t3_5mb1qd,Musk and Tyson are saying this physical universe is a simulation. Its actually more like an RPG role playing game or more accurately RPG games are mimicking real life.    It may well be some kind of test not any supernatural being but the universe itself. One only needs to look at the Earth and the laws of the universe have developed lfeform after lifeform each iteration slightly improved. But each generation is by total trial and error. Look at some of the outlandish dinosaurs that developed how much they had to be eating every day just to survive to the next day. Mobility was a tough problem for the universe to solve. Look at the stegasaurus a pea brain for consciousness and a separate brain in the pelvis just to be a motor controller for its tail. Later you see the raptor getting more defined sharper eyesight larger skull bipedal balanced for running and hopping tearing teeth and claws to rip meat the higher efficiency fuel.    If you look at life its the eternal quest for fuel food. Even bacteria need to eat and poop to survive. The search for food triggers migration migration triggers changes changes trigger more migration triggering more mutations. We have two choices eat or die.    There isnt even the slightest evidence for microbes yet in this Solar System. Look at the planets and as a lifeform observing life its easy to recognize the planet Earth is alive. The other life on it are just extensions of the living planet. The Sun is the sustainer but Earth is the mother.    We are at the stage if the US China and Russia let fly all their hydrogen bomb warheads at once will be like finding that single bullet in the chamber while playing Russian roulette.  All out nuclear war is fairly instantaneous annihilation. A limited regional nuclear war will be slowly choking ourselves to death kind of like a hanging game.  Meanwhile we will be slowly choking on our waste products for a longer more agonizing species extinction. The jury is still out whether the decision is push the button or slowly gag to death on human ape waste. Not looking too good for the human ape to pass the universe RPG final puzzle game. ,space,dc2a6qi,1,t5_2qh87

10251511,0,t1_dc5cegu,I have wasted waaay too much time thinking about this.ASSUMPTION Everything is indoor in pressurised venues. There are as yet no spacesuits allowing athletic movement and hard contact without leakage or rupture.Aside from the obvious flat long trajectory of any thrown or struck object humans depend on higher gravity to get one foot down after the other quickly. Lower gravity means more air time lower acceleration and top foot speed. So the speed of the players will slow as their leaping ability and passing ability increases. Increased air time is not an advantage for ground speed because air resistance is the principal impediment to high running speed making more air time a negative factor we need successive quick steps to fight air resistance.Basketball Passing roughly the same but the trajectories would be flatter. Bounce passes would need to be shoved at the floor in order to evade opponent steals but theyd bounce up faster and be more difficult for the receiving player to control. Passes in which one or both players are several feet in the air add a whole dimension to the game. Shooting again flat trajectories might cut lunar basket ball scores dramatically because a shot with lots of arc is going to mosey slowly down toward the basket allowing easy blocks. So one must shoot flattrajectory shots with a much lower success rate. Running takes longer to come down so probably game will be slower more passingoriented. Harder to maneuver because you have to wait for your next stride to hit the floor  no quick corrections or zigzags. Jump shots become a huge part of the game as you can throw the ball down toward the target. The problem is that defenders have more time to watch you rise in the air and can anticipate your shot for blocking. Alleyoop shots become much more frequent.American football Immense passes which dont come down very quickly mean much longer plays with higher interception rates. More bulletflattrajectory passing over longer distances. Running plays might be entertaining since you cant change direction at all quickly and this applies to the defenders and ball carrier alike. yard field goals would become routine unless the dimensions of the uprights are changed.Tennis Probably impossible with the current court and net dimensions. Most tennis shots barely clear the net on Earth to hit a ball hard enough so that youre opponent wont easily reach it it has to be straight and low taking advantage of the Earths gravity to keep it in the court. Short of tremendous topspin on each show or a much lower net andor a bigger court I dont see how tennis works. As with every other sport in lowerG acceleration is hampered by how long it takes for your body to return to the ground for the next stride. Perhaps this could limit a competitors mobility enough to make lowerspeed shots harder to reach than on Earth and thus keep the game interesting.Hockey Probably no difference. Different skate blades might be necessary to dig into the ice with lower downward pressure from the players body mass but puck travel wont change much.Soccer Clearances passeskicks across a substantial portion of the field will be longer but lower hang times being much increased as it football. Ground shots will go farther. Midfielders gifted in long defense splitting passes will be much more significant fewer bounces on long passes lower trajectory and so quicker. No more attempts to lob the ball over the keepers head since it comes down slowly enough to be blocked even by a nonkeeper. Passing will be mostly at ground level  fewer header attemps on goal at corner kicks. Corner kick strategy will be completely rewritten.Track amp Field All running sports will be slower because of longer time between steps. Hammer throw javelin and shot will suffer slightly from lower grip on the ground but the bigger flight parabolas will compensate. Air currents might become an issue for the javelin. High jump will be awesome. Pole vault much more than the high jump requires sprinting traction on the approach which is diminished at low G but I cant see how it wouldt be spectacular.Volleyball Much improved. Because so much volleyball action involves one leap or stride at lowG defensive range is greater. Because of higher leaping ability downwardtrajectory shots should be possible from all over the court.Baseball Impossible with current number of players. Probably need  additional players for another layer of outfields plus fences  feet from the plate. Infielders and runners will both be slower more base hits fewer stolen bases and fewer extrabase hits.,space,dc62csd,2,t5_2qh87

What youll be looking at is known as lightspeed lag  it would take  hours for any sort of information to reach the outer Solar System. No interplanetary Internet and huge implications for every sphere of life.All youll need are reasonably big radio dishes. Look at Voyager and the Deep Space Network for a lowlevel interstellar comms system. When you get the party going ultralight antennas many kilometers in size will be easy to construct.As to lasers also dishes but silvercoated ones. A green laser fired from an Earthbased observatory has a minimum impact area of  km by the time it reaches retroreflectors on the Moon.Lasers will provide improved bandwidth but iming should be more difficult.,space,dchkh84,2,t5_2qh87

The space shuttle had the same expectations Look I am an aerospace engineer who works on jet aircraft. There are no magical diagnostics. Fatigue analysis and tests are completed to determine problem areas and critical components are inspected or replaced on specific intervals. Some components have to be replaced every time because of the limitation of the material. Thats the reality. When one of these rockets land i guarantee it will be inspected combination of eddy current magnetic particle Xray and fluorescent penetrant inspections most likely and a lot of times things will need to be disassembled to be able to inspected. Also many things will be replaced because of how critical they are. Hopefully the disassembly and replacement will be designed to come apart easily but sometimes it just cant. Permanently attached joints tend to be stronger and lighter. So all Im saying is we dont know how much refurb is required yet. They havent told us. Im betting those first few static tests were completely torn apart and inspected. I also know with more data more landings they can get a more accurate picture of where to look and what to replace. And hopefully it wont be much. But only time will tell.,space,dcn1hgp,0,t5_2qh87

Since this project has been kept very hushhush its safe to presume its fairly cuttingedge. Another good contender may be the Dragon capsule which although it has not been approved for manned launches has gone up several times unmanned so you could consider that in operationThat said its worth keeping in mind that just because a ship is in the same family as an older vessel or whathaveyou it doesnt mean that its not advanced. The Soyuz for example doesnt use the original computers that it did back in the s! And much of the technology on the ISS is ancient by todays standards simply because its hard to ship stuff up and it still for the most part works. Other stuff is of course cutting edge so much so in fact that they do experiments on the ISS literally investigating new ways to cut the edge deeper.All in all it takes so long to develop test and gain confidence in any space vehicle that its almost impossible to say this is more advanced than that its not like a car where we get a new model every year.

10482271,0,t1_dcw4ui4,With such people you dont need to continue on the tack of arguing about climate change itself  they will never believe we are causing the climate to change with CO emissions so why bother?  However they cant deny the fact that we ARE adding massive amounts of CO to the atmosphere  thats just raw data that we KNOW to be true because were actively tracking it.So when I am confronted by such a person I usually try to shift the argument to ocean acidification  CO in the atmosphere is absorbed into the oceans which raises the waters PH level making it more acidic.  This is rapidly getting to the point where many organisms various planktons coral etc will no longer be able to survive and their populations will crash.  These particular organisms are at the bottom of their food chains or in the case of coral provide habitats so when they die off it will lead to a chain reaction that will kill off a massive number of the oceans lifeforms.  Billions of humans rely on fishing to survive economically and as their personal primary food source.  If life in the ocean starts dying off those people will no longer have a means to support themselves  this will lead to mass famine economic crashes and ultimately the worst refugee crisis the world has ever seen in other words most of the horrible things that climate change itself will lead to are going to happen anyways due to acidification even if global temperatures dont continue increasing andor cant be affected by our actions anyways.There is a much clearer cause and effect between CO emissions and ocean acidification  its far more difficult to deny that we are the ones causing it.  Plus you can demonstrate how it works with a simple can of soda which is not something you can easily do with climate change.,space,dcw9v15,2,t5_2qh87

Rising oceans are bad for sales.  Whos going to want to buy property that will soon be underwater?  By denying the problem exists he hopes to increase sales.

You might see huge purple mountains with rings of the planet framing the horizon. You might see a neighboring planet unimaginably close to the one youre on and if you speed up the time scale watch it dance with you as you orbit their star. You can fly through nebulae fall into black holes and sometimes even find stars with planets insanely close to those black holes. One of my favorite things to do is find a terrestrial planet close enough to a black hole that you can actually see it in the sky from the surface. Just imagine how mindblowing that would be to look up into the sky day or night and see the bright glowing accretion disk framing a gigantic black hole just looming in the distance.

So . is many orders of magnitude larger than . The difference in mass between the Earth and Sun doesnt really matter with that huge of a difference in distance. The moon feels the sun but no more than you do walking on Earth.Neptune besides the mass differences has an orbital velocity around  that of Earth. Were moving way faster in our orbit. A stable orbit is a function of mass distance and velocity. Your question comes down to how do stable orbits exist. Thats how. Those numbers have to match up so that the force from the orbit itself and the force of gravity are in equilibrium. And in general nature wants them to match up so it tends to happen. If a body is out of equilibrium one way its going to move until it either breaks orbit falls into the body its orbiting or enters into something closer to equilibrium. The last being the most likely. Getting something to orbit is actually really easy.Decaying orbits exist but the sun was formed substantially before the planets sort of Im obviously not being very detailed with this. That means that the planets didnt show up and coincidentally fall into orbital patterns they formed in those patterns already starting out as swirling dust and eventually formed themselves in stable positions.,space,ddg9bb6,3,t5_2qh87

10706592,0,t3_5t47wx,Just to clarifyAlpha Centauri the nearest star system to earth contains three stars Alpha Centauri A a GV yellow dwarf star. It is best described as a slightly larger version of the Sun. Alpha Centauri B a KV orange dwarf star. It is slightly smaller than the sun and notably cooler. Proxima Centauri also Alpha Centauri C a MVe red dwarf star. It is much smaller and cooler and dimmer than the Sun or either of its companions.Alpha Centauri A and B orbit each other and Proxima Centauri is thought to orbit the barycenter or center of mass of A and Bs shared gravitational system. It orbits VERY far away from them relative to how close the Solar Systems planets are to the Sun and orbits only once every  years.Presently Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to the Solar System and we have detected at least one planet orbitting it. However due to the low mass of the red dwarf this planet  called Proxima b  may be tidallylocked meaning it does not revolve relative to its facing toward the star. This means that one side of the planet always faces Proxima Centauri and one side faces away there is no daynight cycle and one half the planet is dramatically hotter than the other. We do not believe a planet like this could support an atmosphere liquid water or consequently any form of naturallyoccurring organic life. Even if Proxima b is not tidallylocked the habitability of planets orbiting red dwarfs involves many variables we have no way to predict or measure. Recent models I wasnt aware of permit the establishment of an atmosphere on a planet like this which would mostly equalize the temperature between both halves and potentially induce rotation. uPlutoandCharon has more info in his reply.The main pair of the system while further away are both substantially closer to the Sun in composition and would be more likely to contain planets near or within their habitable zones  the band or ring surrounding a star where a planet can achieve temperatures permitting liquid water.. This ring is different for every star but our models are mostly based around Sunlike stars and its with yellow yelloworange and orange dwarves that we have the most confidence in their results.,space,ddkazx9,50,t5_2qh87

10777027,0,t1_ddrjnb4,The original Apollo project like all government projects was an ego trip. Its purpose was twofold to prove to the world that the US was the greatest nation by beating the Soviet Union and less publicly to advance military soace technology for defense. Science beyond the question of whether humans could survive up there was actually an afterthought as far as the Congress was concerned. NASA people just like von Braun had done  were using the military applications to drive their dream.Apollo took  to  of the entire federal budget. By  many in Congress were strongly of the opinion that the whole space thing was a boondoggle. Its almost certain that if reaching the Moon in  years had not been John Kennedys dying promise the project would have been cancelled by Johnson.Read the Wikipedia article about the NERVA project and the Saturn N which was to incorporate a nuclear powered third stage sufficient to get human explorers to Mars. Certain Congresscritters realized that by cancelling the nuclear engine it would abort NASAs foolish spending on Mars trips. In my opinion this was the episode that forced NASA to transition from a cando engineering organization to a government agency that just did whatever the politicians wanted. But!! For all this time NASA with the assistance of a few in Congress has managed to always continue the research to fund interesting small budget projects to assist the industry in countless ways using nothing but the pocket change left over.The plain fact is that governments have no good motivation for going to space except for defense and related considerations. If we depend on governments to do space it will never happen.This is why commercial nongovernment space is so important. It is people with the money and the Dream of something beyond us who will develop space. Government will follow especially if it appears other governments are going there  we have to plant our flag of get left behind even if flagplanting is a violation of treaties.Governments generally do not engage in high risk commercial activities like space mining and space tourism. There is no benefit and huge potential losses in the public media. They donscience only because they are pushed through do it by industry and people. And the majority of people today still think the money should be spent on them not space foolishness nit realizing how much of their standard of living depends on space already.I like to point out Columbus. I believe his funding was from Isabella and Ferdinands personal funds not the state treasury. So he was really embarking in a publicprivate partnership and a venture capital project.

Those craters didnt get there because of space pimples and the moon has enough gravity to keep a lot of that it just needs to be processed and manufacturedand yeah a lot of money needs to go in to it...but a m to m specialized machine for sifting moon material is hardly anything when the launch to get it there in the first place is at least m,space,ddvckrq,1,t5_2qh87
10813788,0,t3_5uk609,There is some idea. Initial state conditions.    Using the word universe by itself is like using the word weather by itself. Weather has different qualities characteristics behaviors definition depending on the adjective used such as hot weather cold weather wet weather dry weather. The same with the universe.    The fixation is on the Physical Visible universe. It is not infinite it is not immortal it is not calm it is not smooth it is not serene it is not static and so forth. It is transitory dynamic violent chaotic beautiful horrifying dangerous and mortal.    In this Physical Visible universe that we exist in we or at least some human apes are measuring it. One of the measurements is of the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB.        This is like a sphere around us that defines the boundary of the Physical Visible universe. We are measuring it all around us varying about  degrees above absolute zero. Outside this layer is another layer the oscillons in the inflaton field of spacetime. This is not optically visible and we may not be able to measure it even if we penetrate beyond the CMB radius. Outside of this layer is the initial Rapid Expansion. Outside of this is what would be outside this Physical Visible universe.    That will be in the initial state conditions. What are the initial state conditions? Mass is zero energy is zero zero photons zero motion. That is what is outside. Zero. Nothing. Nothing is not black because black is Something. True Nothing is the absence of Something. The major human ape problem is to perceive this Physical Visible universe as Everything when it is not Everything. It is only a bit of Something and that Something exists for a limited time until it dissipates into a state that is indistinguishable from Nothing.    All this talk about the universe these days and the silence about the Super Void is deafening. The Super Void basically throws the big bang theory out the window. The Super Void is like a hole in the CMB and that is because it appears to be at absolute zero.        The interesting development is that negative absolute zero has been achieved in the laboratory so we may have another clue that one of the initial state conditions of Nothing is that it has a temperature below absolute zero.,space,ddvd6q5,3,t5_2qh87

You will have to read the article to find out and dig up its resources to validate that yes there was a legit reason for fears.

10933372,0,t1_de7h6hr,no actually its an eso amp nasa discoveryTRAPPIST spotted regular dimming events which the team interpreted as evidence of three different planets crossing the face of or transiting the star. In May  Gillon and his colleagues announced the existence of these three alien worlds called TRAPPISTb TRAPPISTc and TRAPPISTd. All three the team reported are roughly the size of Earth and may be capable of supporting life.The astronomers kept studying the system using TRAPPIST and a number of other telescopes on the ground. This followup work suggested that the supposed TRAPPISTd transits were actually caused by more than one planet and also revealed evidence of additional possible worlds in the system. A threeweek observation campaign by NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope in September and October  helped clear all of this up. Spitzers transit data confirmed the existence of planets b and c but revealed that three worlds are responsible for the originally detected TRAPPISTd signal. And Spitzer also spotted two more exoplanets in the system for a total of seven.so if that isnt a team effort i dk what is!,space,de7p84z,8,t5_2qh87

New they run .. On Craigslist you might find one for around . or so. For Astrophotography add about k to those prices minimum and about  months of trial and error and frustration while climbing the learning curve. Still a ton of fun though! For now look into a dobsonian. Also check out sky Safari on your phone and maybe order the book Turn left at Orion. Head on over to rtelescopes and read the info bar.

Im certainly not opposed to theoretical research.Its just like I said elsewhere I think that when the answer is found it will be something very elegant and it will likely solve unexpected problems as everything falls into place.But dark matter doesnt have to be exotic. It could be dim or we could be wrong about gravity itself.And if were wrong about gravity itself then there might not be any need for dark energy. Or there are other ideas which make it unnecessary for one reason or another.But neither concept is useful at this point its attempting to fit the evidence into the math. At this point dark energy is more useful to predict the end of the universe than anything else. It essentially cant be disproven yet. The same is true of dark matter. It explains why stars are observed moving at the same rate around galaxies but it doesnt put products on the shelves. If we are working with a flawed model of gravity there may be another reason for that.Im not sure that either concept will survive a complete theory about gravity though Im not married to any idea about what may replace them.,space,df4neq3,5,t5_2qh87

Throw money at NASA you end up with  assistants to the deputy manager of the senior advisor to the director of outreach and diversity.  All of whom it turns out are children or  cousins of some congressman or another.  On the other hand spending a bunch of money on big boosters for a moon mission and then being damn sure that the money is only spent on rockets for a moon mission ensures that companies will be willing to tool up to build those rockets.  There are enough leftover RSD for the first couple launches.  Put out a bid for a rocket with the stated capacity for any rockets after that.  If SpaceX Boeing or Blue Origin can have a flight ready rocket for less than the SLS ready before the RSDs run out they get the contract.  If not we stick with the SLS.  The key difference from the existing program is that you pay for the rockets not for development.  Paying to develop rockets that never fly has been what is killing NASA for the past two decades.  NASA is one of the most popular government agencies.   The US taxpayer doesnt begrudge them the money but damn it we want some flight ready hardware not just PowerPoint presentations.,space,dfh7slj,1,t5_2qh87

11384680,0,t1_dfm3id2,I enjoyed reading this and I agree with the idea that as a whole humanity should be less committed to funding the military and to stay away from competitive paranoid line of thinking that our enemies want war least we ourselves wind up purposely and preemptively causing our very own extinction. Not only that unwittingly causing our foes the full pretext justification in order to retaliate which can doom humanity twice over. I have always felt extreme sympathy for John F. Kennedy when he was assassinated because in that moment he must have died thinking we would all wind up in a nuclear war at behest of General Curtis Demon Lemay and General Taylor. Thank feck our world still exist!We must realize we are on a third world planet full of common children and children turned into adulthood with no idea of the feck theyre supposed to do. This is why I believe that it is our duty to realize why education is so important  so that what we have learned isnt lost generations after generation.As a  year old man I have noticed that alot of charities and institutions like hospice hospitals and schools have always had  year after year have constant funding issues and yet in our worldwide politics there is a constant stream of lobbying in which annual income funding perpetuates the status quo that we all can bear witness to.Then I visually wonder what if every charities hospitals and schools built a greenhouse garden in which to grow renewable organic food? To create a cycle of what mother nature gives humanity year after year?Staffers students and even unemployed people could help maintain and sustain huge plots of land to grow food in. I can see this as helping lower employment rate.The banks could issue bonds or use small loan installments towards repair or losses of perishable food.However a surplus of food could then be taken to local community grocery stores at a profit and thereby drive prices down which will kickstart our local and statewide economy as a whole. Then outsourced competitive food prices would have to compete yet also be forced to drive prices up when enough people dont buy into it.Then each organizations should have a team of graphic designers to combat mainstream media  to help promote creating a new systematic status quo of the gaia project in which the law should decreed that greenhouse garden are the stuff of which all of life depends on should be untouchable by all future political administration  and if enough citizens protected it took initative to not be fully dependent on the Government  we would be all better off.I believe the role of Government is to reflect the true moral conscience of society and not be an  beall endall of means in itself entity focused on enriching its bureaucratic process year after year.If we had a nationwide greenhouse garden supply of food we could then create an annual income in which our publicy valued buildings can sustain itself in a selfsufficient way... and we have an extra funding income wherein our current system  existing funding model can only afford to have one programs or another be cut and funds then go towards to military expenditure.And if we want to create a safer democrat republican world  military wise. I believe that... the world is addicted to war and is therefore in need of a democratic intervention.Every soldier every commanding officer should have a democratic right to hold its own top military elections  for only the very top key positions and have the right to vote for the people who hold topkey positions of the entire military infrastructure.Because why else do our soldiers fight to protect us and if every soldiers who have families at home  could be entrusted to protect the fate of our nation by voting in the best and top military minds.. who could then decide the fate of our countries and world?I came to think of all this because I admit I have become extremely.. extremely cynical of our world... and I dont really see anything changing because we already have enough problems in our own backyards... But I do believe if we all tried each day to be a little nicer took our own steps to become selfsufficient at home... and by looking inward to our own attitudes  and realize that our own attitudes is as essential to others attitudes... then we can start to see how we can help others. We can only practice peace at the individual local level... and understanding world peace means that it only requires we live with each other in mutual tolerance  and respect each other.. Even if you dont like my opinion and think Im piece of shet and hate me because my ideas are wrong... but I will definitely value your restraint as long as you value my restraint.Surely we must strive to even help others who willingly wants to combat depression or other problems  least we combat our own inner demons.Only then can we discover one day by keeping the peace in our own life can we make realistically heaven on Earth actually possible... rather than us fighting or waiting to find heaven in the afterlife.Id rather believe peace is possible. Even if its only possible by  than to hold a total defeatist view that this is wholly unrealistic that we are doomed to war.,space,dfmfn1u,2,t5_2qh87

Eliminating  of the cost of a launch is a joke.Elon didnt give us a time line  well....theres a first time for everything.  Whatever timeline he might have given we would blow past it in Elon year  between  and  years per Elon year historically Does your Double quantity rule of thumb multiply. I hope not. because Elons th cost would take  iterations of decreasing  for a total market size increase of  or approx  million.  Scale the  launches of  by that and you have a quarter of a million rocket launches per day.More sensibly it simply requires  iterations of decreasing  for a total market size increase of  or x   launches per year   or just over  a day.Do you see a market for  launches a day over say the next generation   years? I dont.   The rate of launches as been largely decreasing from  in the late s to late s  to more like  in the past  decade.  Largely speaking  its been about flat for ish for a half century.     Using analogues of ocean liners or aircraft or cars is nonsense.    Sputnik  was  years ago but only  years after the Wright Brothers took to the Air.     It was  years between Lindbergh crossing the Atlantic and Armstrong walking on the moon......which was  years ago.The first commercial flight across the Atlantic took  hours in .  Just  years later it was down to a little over  hours with jet aircraft.   For the last  years air travel across the Atlantic hasnt improved....infact its LESS comfortable you get LESS room and its and no faster.  Do things cost  as much now?

11460908,0,t1_dfu59oi,Tesla is no different from SpaceX in that regard. Both companies are innovative in their field. Tesla has used much of the advance technologies developed at SpaceX. E.g. aluminum friction welding developed to build the Falcon  rocket was transferred to Tesla to make the worlds first and still possible only whole welded aluminum body. They but together the car body with space grade boron steel bolts and made a structure so strong that the machine for testing the strength of the roof broke down.No other car maker has had as good batteries and drivetrain as Tesla to the best of my knowledge. They made major innovations in how battery cells were put together and cooled.What other car has the performance of a sports car and can fit  grownups and  kids while having the industries best autopilot continuous software upgrades etc. If you think Tesla sucks it is only because you only focus on the bad parts and completely ignore the fact that Tesla is a startup. You think Tesla is supposed to outperform every other car maker on every possible metric with limited resources and experience building cars?

11590365,0,t1_dg9regd,gt Recently Williams and colleagues were doing an ISS experiment called FLEX to learn how to put out fires in microgravity when they came across something odd. Small droplets of heptane were burning inside the FLEX combustion chamber.  As planned the flames went out but unexpectedly the droplets of fuel continued burning.gt Thats rightthey seemed to be burning without flames says Williams. At first we didnt believe it ourselves.gt In fact Williams believes the flames are there just too faint to see.  These are cool flames he explains.gt Ordinary visible fire burns at a high temperature between K and K.  Heptane flame balls on the ISS started out in this hot fire regime.  But as the flame balls cooled and began to go out a different kind of burning took over.  gt Cool flames burn at the relatively low temperature of K to K says Williams.  And their chemistry is completely different. Normal flames produce soot CO and water.  Cool flames produce carbon monoxide and formaldehyde.  gt Similar cool flames have been produced on Earth but they flicker out almost immediately.  On the ISS however cool flames can burn for long minutes.,space,dg9rxvs,37,t5_2qh87

This unequivocal confidence comes from me both being a man of science and a man of faith.  As a man of science it seems to me that with how much we are discovering about the universe and how many planets there are out there it seems to be an impossibility that there isnt at least very simple life.  My complete certainty though is based on my faith Mormon.  I believe in God in believe in the afterlife and Mormonism itself is very cosmological.... And worlds without number have I created...And as one earth shall pass away and the heavens thereof even so shall another come and there is no end to my works neither to my words.

Very optimistic and hopeful about the nature of a species able to take to the stars. This is due to the planetary challenges industrial worlds face. Disaster political or natural can cause civilization to collapse. If civilization collapses there is no hope for a species to take to the stars given the immense implications such as nuclear war or environmental catastrophe. Only a species that can come together and face these challenges united has a chance and Sagan believed that any spacefaring civilization would inherit these characteristics.The case that Earth would be the best source for resources seems unlikely given how abundant resources are in a localized space.

Would you take a responsibility to give advanced technology to something that will destroy you without even blinking just because you look different? We have a great problem with other civilizations even on our own planet  we dont know how to explain to ppl that they shouldnt kill each other because of religionpoliticsresources. We already learn that you cant give advanced technology to more primitive civilizationscultures without paying terrible price because its almost always means war to them at least.

We cant exactly have a space party with dinosaurs or bacteria or people who bombed themselves back to the stone age.

11622346,0,t3_65rovj,I watched the video and I have an impression that girl does not know what she talks about. Creation of orbital habitat on Venus is way beyond our current capabilities. That is what she is talking about. Upper atmosphere exploration with humans. Everything would have to hauled from Earth there. And everything would have to hardened for way bigger temperatures. Saying that its for science is also wrong cause it literally dies not give us nothing in regards on how to establish a human presence in space.Europa was also mentioned in video but really? Sending humans to Europa? When we dont know how to send them on Mars safely and fetch them back? Maybe we should strat from walking and the start running.Creating Moon deep space gateway is a very good idea. It relatively close and we made number of maned flights there. We have plenty of experience. if we could start by creating a station in space that could assemble the expedition that is great. That means that we are one step closer to next planet moon that we can visit.Mars is very interesting planet to create a colony. It relatively close. Theoretically humans can survive on the surface for longer time. And we could harvest materials on Mars to create infrastructure on site. Way that I see it is that it has nothing to do with having multi planet species. It has a lot to do in learning how to survive outside Earth. It has a lot to do with getting closer to moons of Jupiter or to asteriond belt. Mars could be our gateway to rest of the solar system.,space,dgdejvu,6,t5_2qh87

11733330,0,t3_67f4mx,Seems like we prefer to do exercises for cases of asteroid impact  rather then setting up a space based telescope made to discover all asteroids and so get years in advance early warnings and chance to change their trajectory.So it seems that the scientists and the politicians just decided it is better to get hit rather then to have opportunity to deflect an asteroid.Do they also run any exercises for what will happen to them once we get hit? editright right this is a fantasitc scenario where we discover an asteroid ten years in advancegtThe day after  PDC is discovered JPLs Sentry impact monitoring system along with ESAs similar CLOMON system both identify several future dates when this asteroid could potentially impact the Earth. The date of the most likely potential impact is July    over ten years away  but the probability of impact is very low about  chance in .And we will do that with what? We dont have any telescopes made specifically to discover asteroids of that size somewhere between  and  meters and we only have a few earth based ones who are busy with other things most of the time. Its just going to happen right? Because we will get lucky.Whats the probability we will get so lucky?,space,dgq0458,1,t5_2qh87

11787253,0,t1_dgvb93x,gt You keep referring to CSS as functional. Its not. Thats a hack. CSS is not about function.By allowing people to customize their subreddits in an infinite number of ways that alone is functionality. Theres really no argument here. And there are the infinite number of ways people have used CSS to add functionality to their subreddits. Were talking moving buttons around placing links in relevant places so they can easily be found using the sidebar for listings rankings countdown timers and an infinite number of other things I cant recall. Ive seen people do some amazing things with css over the years and almost all of it has to do with functionality. gt CSS is about design and style sheets. Not function.Heh if you dont mind me asking how many subreddit stylesheets have you made? Because thats precisely how I use CSS  to add functionality. Like say a nightmode version of the subreddit so people arent staring at a big white bright screen. Or using reddit enhancement suite classes to further enhance my communities. You say CSS doesnt add functionality and I say you must not know CSS very well. Or at all from the sounds of it. I dont mean that as an insult but your claim is just so far out there I have to wonder whether you truly are a web developer. gt No shit? Because every time they say wordone they get people like you starting crusades by assuming the malicious. People like me? You mean the guy who was here when reddit was an insignificant niche site where everyone literally knew everyone elses name? The same guy who used to play fantasy football back in  with Alexis the sites founder? Id like to think my opinion should hold some weight given all the work Ive put in to this site. Im not just some random user Ive helped build some of reddits largest communities. Ive been here from the very beginning. If my opinion isnt worth anything if Im not worth listening too then we have a deeper more fundamental issues at play here. Does experience not count for anything? gt Youre a volunteer. Get that through your head.Well that answers that. I guess we disagree. I think there are people on reddit who have been here a long long time who have a deep understanding of this website and I think their opinions holds weight. I may not agree with their opinion all the time but I will always listen to it because its based on their years of experience. I would never write someone off just because theyre a volunteer.gt Youre right it seems people do forget these huge changes... didnt kill reddit yet. See Banning toxic subs introducing subreddits removing GIF images from CSS the profile pages Ellen Paos ascension to CEO etc etc etc etc.None of those not a single one affected reddits core functionality. Of all the websites over the last  years can you name one that went through a redesign removing functionality and went on to do better? I cant think of a single one. On the contrary every single one that I can think of ended up crashing amp burning. Those who dont learn from history are doomed to repeat it? Pretty sure that applies here.gt Reddit is not built for the sake of mods. Its built for the sake of users. You have that backwards reddit is built on the backs of its mods. Without the mods or rather community creators there is no reddit. However without the users reddit still could exist. In fact thats how it did exist initially. Reddit wasnt always the th largest website in the U.S... Are you a millennial by any chance? Im starting to get that entitlement vibe. P Im only saying that halfjokingly. It seems like everyone takes for granted the years of hard work by reddits community creators. They feel entitled to free stuff without acknowledging all the hard work people do... Even reddits admins appear to be taking them for granted. No surprise though since I cant remember the last time an admin sat around and did some moderating. Were talking  years ago. gt But Ill put money on it right now that no it wont. Not even close.You might be right. But one thing is certain do you think this change is going to bring in more viewers? Like a lot more? Because the risk is there that much everyone agrees on. And I guess the real question is does the benefits of this change outweigh the risks? I dont think its even close. The reward is minimal if not outright nonexistent while the risk is massive judging by history. ,space,dgw4hmk,0,t5_2qh87
