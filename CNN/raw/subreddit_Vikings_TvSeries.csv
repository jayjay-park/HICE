6912007,0,t1_d0zpkss,Its funny I mentioned this before in a different sub maybe that Id hoped Floki would become the new Seer for use during Bjorns reign.  It seems it might be coming true especially if he ends up raising Boneless.,Vikings_TvSeries,d0zspar,1,t5_2wpd6
7189993,0,t3_4d18e2,By Viking standards Id say NONE OF THEM!  Ragnar has done what all Viking men aspired to do CONQUER and EXPLORE.  Except he did it so well he ended up a King!  Of course it will be a rough ride but read up on how little Odin gives a crap.  Do what you must to impress to gods!Rollo has betrayed his people and his family but he has done it in order to gain a secure hold on great power which is what every Viking would pursue if he could.  Ragnar wanted to conquer Paris.  He got in the gates and took some stuff.  Rollo has the Princess and access to all the Paris has!Floki has managed to use his unique skills to propel his people to new lands and great riches.  He has also walked the very fine line of religious divide in the times even tipping over and following in Lokis style yet has still been able to retain respect and trust from his people.Theyre all excellent Vikings in their own way.  None of them are the worst because all of them are the best at what they need to be.  Except Ill admit Ragnar is having a tough time.,Vikings_TvSeries,d1vfw5s,1,t5_2wpd6

10307139,0,t3_5n2m5g,Amen. Such a gripping show. The only other show I have binge watched is the Wire and even that lagged in places as did Breaking Bad. This one though? Absolutely gripping all the way through. If you havent see the Wire or HBOs Rome watch them. They are really really good. As is Breaking Bad. Bonus for Rome is the crazy level of research and authenticity they bring to it. ,Vikings_TvSeries,dccdbet,2,t5_2wpd6
10308288,0,t3_5nleq9,I remember an AMA with the writer of the show in which he said hed like to continue the show after Ragnars death. Along with his death in the show lining up with actual legend I think hes gone for good.,Vikings_TvSeries,dcci0h4,3,t5_2wpd6

10417028,0,t3_5p65ki,The only thing I can say that annoys me with this episode and many previous episodes are the times it just jumps as if certain parts of the story have been edited out. The main one was when it was mentioned who should be sacrificed as at should be someone important  then a scene later theyve chosen someone with no explanation of why. But Ive got used to it and just roll with it other than that I think  it was still epic,Vikings_TvSeries,dcou6rl,9,t5_2wpd6

10592413,0,t1_dd82cdz,Same answer Im no history buff but direct decency from the male line of rollo dates to at least  king Henry the st of England. thats a few hundred years after the vikings show is set.Meanwhile the lothbrok line is very debatable It isnt even certain ragnar was  real person and is possibly the mixing of various heros from the sagas. So you cant really follow his proper decency. ,Vikings_TvSeries,dd8ixj1,3,t5_2wpd6
