3676141,0,t1_cq97qnj,Agreed for most parts. One comment though regarding p. I am all in favour of bumping up on the strategic element of the Race. Maybe they should try and introduce the Salvage Pass in the US version allbeit with a few tweaks. Maybe make the advantage depending on having another team saved by elimination? Plus also  Every leg should have a switchback challenge.  In some legs teams should start without any money. Preferebly in the middle of the race.

7543981,0,t3_4idnir,The elimination of motherdaughter team Nancy amp Emily in season  was pretty heartbreaking because they were a likable team and their elimination happened in such an unexpected and avoidable way.  At the final  they were significantly in the back of the pack with the villains of the season Bill amp Joe and they both went for the Fast Forward a clue that allows you to skip all tasks and go directly to the pit stop and at this point in the race they were the only two teams still eligible to win the FF and ultimately Bill amp Joe won out.  Nancy amp Emily continued on with the leg but they got frustrated at a task that involved finding a marked car parked on the streets and driving to their next location and knowing they were in last place by a huge margin they decided to just take a taxi to the next location so they could just finish the leg and be eliminated.  However because the pit stop was so far away from the rest of the leg Bill amp Joe decided to wait for a bus ride that left much later in the day because it would be cheaper than taking a taxi all the way and because they assumed that the rest of the teams would take a long time completing the rest of the leg and ended up finishing the leg in last place by several hours even with the FF.  However because Nancy amp Emily had deliberately skipped a task in the leg they incurred a  hour penalty and were eliminated.  Its so crazy to think that had they just not thrown in the towel on that one task they would not only have stayed in the race but they could have gone for the FF in the next leg and possibly even made it to the final !  Just goes to show that you should never give up because something crazy could end up happening.,TheAmazingRace,d2zppjs,2,t5_2stq9

Tension with the Express Pass along with Frankie and Amys fail at the Detour leading to a good last place race and starting the next leg in this episode with the train departure time mention thanks to Alex the Go Train iPhone guy according to Kristens Twitter creates a lot of suspense for next episode.Spoiler tag based on preview since Im not sure if its allowed since it is included but not up to and including this episode can be expected in this thread.s Why would Frankie and Amy tell everyone that Steph and Kristen gave them the pass? Looks like they ruined a potential alliance just to get the target onto someone elses back when they couldve easily said Anne and TanyaStephane and Antoine gave it to them? Its not like any of the contestants remembered the order of every team at each task. Also Rita and Yvette were only following Anne and Tanya on leg  for all Rita and Yvette know the time for going and switching detours on leg  may have been enough time for Anne and Tanya to get the Express Pass.

So they may eliminate a strong team but it may also cost them a first place finish. Or if its the last  teams the uturned team at least has a chance to make it up.

I dont have a way that I would suggest to CBS to handle these situations because to some people what I outlined makes the show more entertaining.

11589220,0,t3_65a6b9, Going to start by saying my fantasy draft is fuuuuucked. There is exactly one team from my T left. Liz and Michael continue to surprise me. I had them as one of the first teams to be eliminated but I love Michael and am thrilled with their success! However I dont know how much longer its going to hold out. Theyve been getting really lucky with the types of challenges and itll only take one rough physical challenge Im thinking like the bikes in UAE from S and theyre donezos. At this point Team LoLo is a myth. If they were a real team on this race we would have seen them by now P Seth and Olive could have gone a lot further and Tara and Joey are almost sliding into that role of physically fit and smart malefemale team. Excited to see if that turns out to be true. Im not faulting Becca too hard on her outlash. This is an incredibly high stress environment and I think we should be focusing more on how fast she and Floyd made up. Brooke and Scott joined LoLo in being invisible this leg but it looks like they have a serious issue next leg. At first I thought that Scott was going to be the fiery one with Brooke balancing it out but its looking more and more that Scott is the calmer one. They could also just spontaneously explode in a glorious way so theres that. Last but certainly not least are Matt and Redmond. They are still my favorite team but they have made some exceptionally bad choices. Their first issue with the coinflip wasnt actually a huge issue to me. They didnt handle it as well as they couldve and hopefully would have put more of an effort into making amends but that shouldnt have been too big of a spat. The line cutting however was huge. That makes them look bad in front of literally every team on the race which is a position you do not want to be in especially with a UTurn board coming up. Redmonds lashes at Vanck didnt help their case either. I can see what the thought process was not defending it mind you but its strategically stupid in so many ways. Matt has sort of faded back a bit and let Red handle the social stuff which hasnt been working too well. I think that Matt should try to step in and fix things with as many teams as possible and force Red to apologize. If they can get into the BrodieKurt zone of being the fun wellliked but still physically monstrous theyll be in a much better place. As of now They have a target from being a physical force. They need to do everything in their power to make friends. ,TheAmazingRace,dg9n93z,8,t5_2stq9

11725484,0,t3_67b0zm,As a long time watcher of TAR and Survivor Id agree with what some other people have said that going in order is a good way to do it. There has been significantly less of an evolution in Amazing Race than in Survivor and a lot of what has changed is based around actual changes in game play mechanics which arent too hard to catch on to. Since the challenges in Amazing Race are a little more weighted than the strategy a lot of the strategy stuff in The Race is more behind the scenes there have been fewer changes from people getting into the gamesmanship of it all.    That being said I think there are also fewer straight up duds as far as seasons go. Whereas there are a number of Survivor seasons that are looked at more definitively as bad whether its because of editing lack of strategy bad winners etc. I think theres less of that in Amazing Race. There are definitely better and worse seasons and the family edition is often panned but even that is more just because it was such a departure from the standard race.  Just overall I think TAR is more even keeled in that sense.     In my opinion you could just skip around but going in order is as good a way as any and I dont think youll run into a season that is painful to get through.,TheAmazingRace,dgp4486,2,t5_2stq9
