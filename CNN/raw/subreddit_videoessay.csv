3891011,0,t1_cqznj8y,But how can you make the argument that moral objectivism falls down because of a universally agreed immorality happens? You agree that your father beating you is objectively wrong and honouring him is objectively right. The appropriate behaviour in response has no bearing on the objectivesubjective nature of moral law.You say There is always a balancing of values going on but this implies there is some external measure which is exactly what this essay is arguing. To use your example again if morality was subjective you have no ability to claim that your father beating you is any more or less moral than if he cares for you. This is the societal poison the essay argues against,videoessay,cqzt574,3,t5_37gci

Of course when the artist is SPECIFICALLY SAYING this is me then you can at least understand that theyre trying to communicate something about themselves but it is less about who they are than it is about how they see themselves usually.

10483564,0,t3_5q24vj,First of all Id like to clarify that people arent criticizing shows for having tone shifts but of misusing them. For instance you cannot have a death scene being abruptly cut by some comedic relief without causing a backlash in the audience.He says that there are sudden tonal shifts in the world and therefore its realistic. What he doesnt understand is that realism doesnt equate to good writing. Seriously by his logic in the original Gundam all the main characters should die by episode  because there are no Newtypes in real life and because they would be powerless against their opponents. Good writing and internal consistency always beats realism in this sense and the thing about fiction is that the more unexpected and sudden tone shifts it has the more it forces our suspension of belief instead of having us see it as realistic. Our expectations of reality simply arent the same as our expectations of fiction and they shouldnt be so either...Its good to see characters in different circumstances its just that when those circumstances have completely different tones and are presented back to back they come off as disjointed and rushed which is a sign of bad writing.He spelled Texhnolyze wrong... Also yes it cannot create the multifacets or whatever of shows with tonal shifts but it also manages to stand out through that regard and besides it wouldnt fit within the bleak setting of that show if ever that was the case. Also also Id like to remind that MOST people do not want for there to be NO tonal shifts just for them to be well planned out. Hes strawmanning a whole argument here...So if I can tell what the tone of each scene is then it doesnt suffer from having a tone thats all over the place. So if in one scene the guys butchering a bunch of babies and the next hes eating cake and drinking tea then its fine as long as I can tell that hes angry and happy respectively? But what about the internal logic? What about suspension of disbelief? What about a proper narrative? Digibro is overlooking all of these for the sake of his argument.And really I think that this is what happens when someone reaches a conclusion and THEN makes an argument for it instead of the other way around.

11097632,0,t3_5ygvoe,The bigger question to ask is if its overpriced then why isnt another company rising to the competition to steal their customers?  The reason is that these monopolies as with all monopolies are protected by regulation not regulated by it.  Thats how regulation WORKS.   Why is it that Google is having trouble getting its own ISP off the ground?  Why is it so expensive?  The cost of materials isnt really the bulk of the reason.Net Neutrality is a philosophy.  Reclassifying ISPs as utilities is not Net Neutrality.  It is maybe someoens idea of an attempt at fulfilling that prophecy.  But it very clearly made it worse.  Making something a utility destroys innovation.,videoessay,depwnru,0,t5_37gci
