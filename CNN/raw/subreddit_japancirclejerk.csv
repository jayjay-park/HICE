Being on call at all hours to clean toilets is especially appealing to me and firmly within my skill set. Since I live dangerously every day cutting through parking lots and crossing streets against the light I have just the golden balls youre looking for.b. How is your role or what kind of character you are in your family or friends community?  Coincidentally I am know around my community as Baka Gaijin which is essentially equivalent to saying Captain Awesome in NEEHONGO. This position will be a huge promotion for me from basically a CAPTAIN to a motherfucking Shogun GENERAL.c. Please choose one of the tasks above which you think you will be good at. And tell us why you think you are good at it.  Cleaning toilets has been a lifelong dream nay obsession of mine. I will work my way up through the ranks one toilet at a time to earn my Shogun position in more than just name but in full and complete Bushido spirit.d. Please let us know your achievement of your hardest battle.  This one time I had to clean the toilet of a man who waged total war on his throne laying complete and terrible waste to the entire bathroom. I had never before seen someone Hiroshima a toilet so utterly completely that the aftermath rivaled that of a chemical weapons testing ground. Holding back my reflexive retching I rolled up my sleeves and dove headfirst into the mess to fight my hardest battle. To be completely honest I cannot remember much about the roughly  hours of heavy combat that took place but I do have flashbacks of huddling in the corner shivering from the relentless onslaught. When I did finally emerge the day was mine and the beast was slain. Toilets the world over tremble from the mere mention of my name except for Japanese squat toilets which are just fucking weird.,japancirclejerk,co8jout,17,t5_2sttb

3368956,0,t1_cpc9pdv,Who hates it?Honest answer to the original question surely it depends on what you read but I like to read military thrillers and usually the primary villain is North Korea in some form occasionally China but the US military is there in a way that is not necessarily friendly or not very skeptical and the US is usually very selfcentered and theres often some sentiment of feeling inadequate or used vs. the US military some resentment of not having an army needing the US but resenting the US at the same time etc. Some are rightwing politics explicitly but not always either. Also sometimes while NK is the enemy theres a sort of... respecting them for being tough too making some critiques about modern fat capitalist societies or about people drunk on peace or whatever.Did you ever read any Japanese novels or stories that takes place during WW or during the occupation about the US military? Some of the themes are there also. Taking prisoners and the prisoners are so fat it makes the village people envious etc.When it comes to comics currently I dont read so many but Im following Attack on Titan and a comic I am a Hero thats a sort of zombie story.But as you say gt occasionally theyve got decent stories.Occasionally they do.

Otherwise it would be prohibitively expensive for a huge number of students. Taking out k to go abroad for a year and study Japanese with a bunch of other Americans seems like a horrible idea to me. gtI actually hated the amount of writing we had to do  two years having to do handwriting drills for the first thousand kanji mandatory composition classes etc.  but damned if it hasnt been insanely useful since then.

Which is what the IWC was put in place to do the moratorium was only on commercial whaling and was only supposed to be in place until the whale stocks could recover to the point where a commercial harvest was again an option.  The Japanese have been collecting this data for years and the data supports the reinstatement of a commercial hunt with reasonable quotas.  And the IWC which has since been stacked with antiwhaling nations continues to go against the recommendation of its own scientific board and block the reinstatement of a commercial harvest.,japancirclejerk,csi1ns6,10,t5_2sttb

They said it in their nicest keigo though.Oh and if you had previously bought a ticket to anywhere past Katsuta then you gotta wait in line at the Midorinomadoguchi for like two hours to get those  yen comped and of course that means itd be faster to have just taken a local train anyway but you want that  yen right? Well well just keep it.Also because this is basically the only way to get to Iwaki this means that Katsuta Station is going to be overflowing with refugees lines for taxis will be  hours long and cost you  yen to get by buses will be nonexistent so you better call your friend to pick you up.

There are a lot of people in Japan who just dont have a very wide world view. They think living in Japan puts them on this unique pedestal when in fact its a very milquetoast experience  Japan is a western country with decades long interactions with foreigners and people working there. These people dont have the language skills and live in a very precipitous bubble and so their experience isnt really original or thoughtprovoking its rehashing the same shit over and over and over and over again. Part of this is the fault of the Japanese themselves and especially programmes like JET which actively encourage this faggoty behaviour. They build Japan up as this totemic figure of uniqueness and intrigue when in fact its an incredibly runofthemill place to live in. So what are you adding to the collective consciousness when you start a blog post about teaching English in some shithole in Shizuoka? Very little. You dont speak Japanese and are working in a very generic job that a lot of people do. If you wanna take some photos and videos and upload them on Facebook and write a few blog posts to your friends  then fine I dont have a problem with that. Its a great way for other people to see what you are doing. But when you start spamming that shit to the widerworld and then get all pissy when the internet community thinks you are a boring cuntwaffle dont come crying like an absolute pussy because youve had your feefees hurt by those mean jaded people on the interwebs.If you wanna do something interesting then for the love of God  DO SOMETHING INTERESTING.
