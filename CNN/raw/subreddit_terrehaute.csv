2346682,0,t3_2m7w03,Java Haute has a fishbowl meeting area in the back.  For the most part its quiet during the day.  Its where I went to study.  Wifi is free with drink purchase.  Its reliable and pretty fast.Coffee grounds isnt bad usually pretty quiet.  Again wifi is free just ask the barista what the password is.  If youre on the southwest side theres Panera usually quiet large and again free wifi.  Not as reliable though.,terrehaute,cm1rezz,5,t5_2tapy

I definitely suggest checking it out. Keep in mind Indiana is a dry state no alcohol sales on Sunday.,terrehaute,cqj27hg,2,t5_2tapy

9449445,0,t3_5a0sjh,Bad experience at Footers?The only time I went in there we stood at the counter for  minutes I walked behind it to check out what Dominion sets they had then we left because no one was around.I could have walked out with whatever sets I wanted. The only time someone made eye contact with me was when me and my daughter were getting back in the vehicle on our way out.,terrehaute,d9ds7oj,1,t5_2tapy
