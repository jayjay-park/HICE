To the people who say things like that I direct them to Maslows Hierarchy of Needs and point out how belonging is beneath esteem you need a sense of belonging before you are able to hold yourself in any esteem.Ive always felt this this quote from Fruits Basket yeah I know. Im rolling my eyes at myself summed up this topic pretty wellgt I hope you will learn to feel good about yourself. What is that supposed to mean? How are you supposed to find these good qualities? I wonder if the reason you dont feel good about yourself is that all you can find are qualities you dont like. I dont think you can. Not like that. Thats not how it works. I think what it takes is for someone else to say I like you. Thats the only way you can truly begin to like yourself. When someone else accepts you thats when you begin to see yourself  through their eyes  and you begin to realize that there may actually be many qualities to like about yourself. I dont think this means we should stop with selfimprovement or making lives for ourselves. I just think it means that we can disregard the crap advice about loving ourselves so that someone else will.,ForeverAloneWomen,cfr6rkj,11,t5_2tzyn

772597,0,t1_cgn53qh,As a guy I want to add thisIm not exactly shy not insanely extrovert either Im pretty good looking if you go by measure of female attention I get lots even from my own GF all the time Im just adding this here because of the topic I wouldnt normally stress it and I am confident of myself of my abilities of my mind of my possibilities etc although Im definitely not an overconfident asshole.However I really really really love my girlfriend so much. But because of that she can either make or break me. If she doesnt support me which does not mean being there for me  hours a day and constantly doing me sexual favors but rather simply answering a message on Hangouts at the right moment or just giving me a feeling of being there when I need it sometimes if she doesnt do that my selfconfidence falters. Not because I dont believe in myself and need external input to prove to me that Im great but because if the one person I love the most does not support me who will? I found that my own girlfriend simply does not want to be supportive. Its not in her DNA if you will. Its not part of her programming. If I believe in myself  all the time she finds that very attractive but if I come to her for her to be supportive she interprets this as begging and gives a damn shit about it. If I give her a look like I want her to make a move and give me a hug she will just look at me and stand there.So now comes the problem where I want to give a real word of advice This is the road to hell for a girl. Yes the girl not the guy keep listening. Right now Im sort of at a crossroads with my girlfriend. She simply wants a guy who is tall cool sexy attractive outgoing simply grabs her by the ass when he feels like it yeah now you can think what you want but my GF is like that but treats him like a little crapshit if he simply wants a bit of support. Also were already  years together so this is not about a flight of fancy.Given this I can not fully commit myself to her please keep reading this has a tragic ending but very worth knowing about. Over the past few weeks I have shut myself a bit up towards her. Yes weve already spent  years together but I realized that I wasnt fully myself in that time. I was a bit too much the way she wanted me to be not enough myself though I didnt completely fake myself .So what this means is If this gets worse or doesnt improve I have to shut myself off from her further and further emotionally. I love her to death. She is the sweetest funniest cutest girl in the entire universe and history thereof but she is also an emotional asshole. Yes she loves me but she just cant stand it if I come to her asking to be supportive of her own volition.If I keep shutting myself off of her even more there are  roads this can take we part or I will probably become an asshole who while still loving her just stays in the relationship for some great but distant kind of love... and sex. I will always love her. But I know now that I can not fully trust her with myself.TLDRSo two notes to all girls who like confident guys Dont look for the overconfident hyped guy. Guys are people and everyone is at times more or less outwardly confident. Dont go for the extremes. True confidence is not about appearing like a machismo gorilla who kicks everyone in the ass. Its about knowing who you are and what you are capable of but the moment you enter a true deep relationship youre only as capable as much as the other person believes in you if your SO doesnt see my example you break down. You need to emotionally isolate yourself from your SO in that moment with the option to part the relationship or youll get suicidal believe me Ive been there a few days ago. Dont be assholes girls. So you like confident guys? Ill be brutally honest here Chances are you are also a girl who while liking confident guys laughs about guys who appear to be idiots to you. If youre interested in someone dont probe him. Be nice. Be a human being. Dont entice interest then throw rocks onto the path just to see whether the guy will tumble or not. I get that this is in your DNA because thats how it works but some of you are simply overdoing it.OK nuff said. Hope this helps someone.,ForeverAloneWomen,cgs3kdb,2,t5_2tzyn
779542,0,t3_231vvx,When I was in college I had friends in the same situation as yourself the only guys who they seemed to attract were only after the one thing. Listen these girls were fun extremely kind and just generally wonderful. They were a joy to be around. That you attract these kind of guys is not a reflection of you it says nothing about your value as a person. I can guarantee that you are better than youre giving yourself credit for and I know you deserve better. I hope you find it.,ForeverAloneWomen,cgsvz1d,2,t5_2tzyn
940602,0,t1_chao460,I dont know about other FAs now but I was always the type of FA who knew the main reason I stayed away from people was an inborn and moderate social anxiety and maybe some sort of cowardice. A cowardice I finally got over. When you get over this cowardice you kinda buy into the notion that most people both men and women are basically using each other for all types of experiences and sensations. Some women want comfort some just want to be appreciated and both ultimately want love and comfort. And theres also women who want more material or less romantic things. Men want practical things and maybe like me see sex more like climbing a mountain and want it for the achievement rather than the actual pleasure which is kinda fleeting if you think about it and it explains why so many of the men I talk to say that even marriage shouldnt stop a man from trying to get as much sex as possible that its a treat to have sex many times a day from more than one woman.That said I will do what you said. As to the FWB thing the only way to get that is to be ambiguous from the start. Thats something Ive learned not being FA anymore that theres always a purposeful grey area both people play and like a devil its always nice to work your way into a persons fantasies and wishes to get what you want and the very way both partners are complicit in this deception is the grey area they both allow to exist.As to precious time its only been like two or three weeks. Oh and its not only men who basically use people to get experience see the recent post titled Dating on this sub the top response clearly states the woman giving OP advice used the dating to get a feel of what she wanted from men. Human relations do seem to include a good deal of selfishness derived from inexperience I dont feel like such a scumbag now though Im biased because Im a man approaching his s and feel like sleeping around is the only way Ill gain the best experience it doesnt matter if I have to lie or cheat to do it the silver lining is Ill make a woman very happy someday with all this knowledge maybe an FA woman who had been searching for a suave guy both in and out of the bedroom. My explorations and exploitations will hone my charm.,ForeverAloneWomen,chb7af1,-1,t5_2tzyn

2506914,0,t3_2ocafh,You really like making topics! I have no issue with that Im actually glad because I wish this sub saw more trafficdiscussion. However you should help stifle the discussion by answering your posed question as well. Life experiences? Oh countless things but Ill think of the more coolwild ones. Go to a World Cup match where the USA is playing. Im a big soccer fan and a passionate Yank. Ive always wanted to experience being surrounded by hundreds of people who support the same team cheering in unison becoming one cohesive force. It would be very euphoric. Which segues quite nicely into the next oneDo acid. One of my suitemates did it in my freshman year. He came up to me and just kept staring at me with his eyes wide open. He didnt say anything but he looked like he was having a good time. I didnt know he was on acid at the time so the whole thing made me very uncomfortable until another one of my suitemates came and took him away. Later he told me that he was seeing musical notes and colors everywhere. Im a very straightedge kind of person not super into alcohol or drugs but acid is something Ive wanted to try for a while.Survive a few days or one day depending on how feasible it is in the Alaskan wilderness with my best friend. This is something hes wanted to do for a long time hes a real natureloving sort of guy. I like nature but not as much as him. Why the fuck would I willingly freeze my balls off in a place renown for being home to bears when I could be watching Reno  in my house with a warm cup of coffee? Well some things you do for others. The survival experience would be something that would test the bonds and endurance of our friendship and our ability to work together. I have confidence in that its an experience that would only be a testament to how close we already are! Successfully have a lucid dream. This is a topic that Ive done a lot of investigation into so Im probably about to go into a ludicrous amount of detail so if you value your time stop reading. I spent one fucking summer attempting to lucid dream. For those unfamiliar a lucid dream is a dream where you are AWARE that you are dreaming and thus you can actually decide what you do in it. I stumbled on a private community of people who were fascinated by lucid dreaming and who worked actively to try to achieve this. Someone there who was experienced in lucid dreaming said that his ultimate goal was to engage his subconscious in a dream and talk to it. Now wed get into some pretty heated Freudian and Jungian psychology here but Ill have mercy on everyone and spare the gory details. Imagine you could talk to your inner child that inner voice that plays a role in every thought you have every action you take. Some people are naturally more intune with that inner voice but Id wager most arent. Can you imagine what you could learn about yourself? About what repressed or simply misplaced memories you may have? Would it be traumatizing? Perhaps. Would it be enlightening? Perhaps so. Would it be phenomenally meaningful? You bet your fucking ass. This was my goal and why I wanted to successfully lucid dream in the first place.  Many people can lucid dream it is something that everyone can do but most will probably have to work at it. Oddly enough some people can naturally lucid dream without trying. One of my friends actually lucid dreams often. I found out when I was talking about the matter and he said yo I do that all the time. I probed him eagerly to hear what he does with his infinite freedom. He started grinning like an idiot and said he always just flies up in the air and keeps spinning until he wakes up.Are you fucking kidding me!?!? Im here trying to find enlightenment and this is how he spends his time. Sigh. Anyway I didnt succeed if youre wondering. I didnt even have  little lucid dream. I bet a lot of people have had reverse lucid dreams. Those are the ones where you wake up and youre in your bed and everything and you THINK you woke up but youre really just dreaming. Then the moment you goddamn realize its a dream you actually do wake up.There are many ways to learn how to lucid dream. The approach I took was to actually enter a dreaming state while I was still fully awake. The short version is it involves tricking your mind into thinking your body is asleep. I actually got pretty damn close. I somewhere in the border between wakefulness and dreaming. But I started hearing some really disturbing noises in addition to the trippy visuals hypnagogic hallucinations that led to me violently forcing myself to snap out of it and wake up. That was it the culmination of a summer of experiences. ,ForeverAloneWomen,cmlsj1c,10,t5_2tzyn

2907875,0,t3_2tf6hw,Its definitely in how you look at it. I agree with a lot of what you say. On the other hand sure a relationship might be nice. Provided its a self sustaining partner and not a manchild Im adopting. Most relationships seem to be more trouble than their worth. The times I do feel sad about being single I think about how most of my friends husbands have cheated and how even  years later it still eats them up inside. How theyre anxiety ridden every time their husband is  minutes late coming home from work. How they have to practice forgiveness every single day and how walking out isnt an option because of the children and the stay at home lifestyle theyre accustomed to and how they dont have their own money to leave even if they wanted to. Is all that daily anguish really worth it to say I have a man....hmm I dunno. I find the love I give myself is often enough. If a guy is in the picture its just a bonus but again the trade off is usually added stress. Maybe Ill change my mind if the right guy ever comes along then again I could just be picky. But maybe this sub isnt for me as a lot of women here state that being FA isnt a choice. Maybe if it was looked at as a choice as in not NEEDING a partner. Then maybe guys will sense theyre not a be all end all and might consider a relationship with a less needy partner. ,ForeverAloneWomen,cnyms1s,4,t5_2tzyn

I didnt mind that much tbh cause when I was very young I was already told I was ugly not a girl etc so it was consistent with my previous experiences. Its not because youre skinny that you cant look feminine whatever that means really. I dont think its mandatory but lets be honest straight men are attracted to women who usually play the feminine card right.

I also rarely get guys approaching me let alone interested in more let alone even getting to the point where an exclusive relationship is even on the table. In those few situations where datesguys did feel close to maybe something the guy essentially decides against it or perhaps for a very long time knew nothing would come of it. And these same guys want relationships and get serious with the next girl. So maybe Im delusional but I feel like I like myself and am a good catch but guys dont see it. Im not even bad looking in fact Im really good looking too. I also went to good schools and have a kickass family and am a pretty normal welladjusted person. My main flaws are that I have never been great at knowing the right things to dosay with people. I have like no leverage with guys at all. And I see guys going after girls who are also insanely fucked up and have nothing going for them.

5326267,0,t3_3nxeh0,I have a mixed bag of distractions. Some days I can get by just reading a new book other times it could take a little alcohol to take the edge off. I actually feel bad about using alcohol lately though because ive never needed it in my life before. Music and exercise work when I really start to get flustered. I was previously a smoker cigarettes and that felt like it gave me greater control over my emotions and appetite. Its almost like it enhanced my focus throughout each day too. A bad habit I managed to kick this year though. If I dont want to spend money instead of going out I will usually watch some new and interesting concept anime. This may not be something women enjoy but I cant help but find more worth watching from Japanese culture than the dozens of procedural crime scene shows on tv.Reading manga can be fun too if you enjoy graphic novels.My outdoor hobby involves jogging solo. I dont know many people aside from family so its hard to organize anything thats more group based. Running around and making my lungs start to burn and shirt get soaked in sweat makes me feel slightly more alive. Mother nature has some great eye candy too so I get lost in scenery like the sun setting across the land while on a route.I dont know if this qualifies as a distraction but I began to love coffee over the last year.

Whereas in the past there where less cosmetics fine clothing solarium or plastic surgery available or they were so pricey that only the elite could afford to them in todays supposedly classless society theres an abundance of all kinds of relatively cheap beauty products and services still not the same quality of as elite products and services naturally so its expected that everyone no matter their socioeconomic class can use them.Couple this with the photoshopped beauty ideals of the media partly false marketing that promises you the looks of a model if you use this or that cream or let the surgeons knife to mould your face and you see why it seems that society is sending us the message that we should spend our money on chasing after the for most of us still hopelessly unattainable beauty ideals.I believe in the olden times ordinary people stressed far less about their looks not only because they didnt see fantastically beautiful people all the time around them in the media and advertising so they couldnt compare themselves to these ideals but because it was also not thought of as realistically possible for them to improve their looks so much.,ForeverAloneWomen,cwdclsc,3,t5_2tzyn

As for friends with benefits I think its  my upbringing talking  I would feel disrespected in such an arrangement. I know it doesnt have to be that way but thats my default reaction.

6282303,0,t3_41kptj,Hey right there with you. Little bit older though but still in the same boat. There are times when my record of not having boyfriends for as many years as Ive lived doesnt bother me much but when Im around people at work and they start making jokes about FA people they dont know I am one because Ive been too embarrassed to sayI play along when they tease me about exes and stuff it really starts to get to me. And then I wonder what they would think if they knew I was one of those people they were making jokes about.I also have dreams like yours sometimes though they get less frequent all the time. On the one hand its good because at least I dont wake up severely disappointed in reality anymore. On the other its bad because they were the only place I got to experience those kinds of things and now I dont even have that.I can say though that despite what I thought for a very long time it did get easier to deal with so theres that at least. ,ForeverAloneWomen,cz3q6xn,3,t5_2tzyn

6401359,0,t3_438c1j,My parents were an arranged marriage and are very old fashioned. I was not allowed to have friends growing up and now am horribly socially awkward. Im approaching my late s and my mother has been trying to get me to see a matchmaker for the last  years but I cant bear the thought of having to interact with another person for the rest of my life. Ill probably become an aged woman.,ForeverAloneWomen,czh9py7,2,t5_2tzyn
6428485,0,t3_43miia,No. Or rather I hope not. And Ill tell you whyI think its important you say youre beautiful but until I found these subreddits....I went without any place but maybe Jezebel to say Hey Im pretty enough for some creepy old man to harass me and guys to be polite to me but they would never ever see me as sexual I make them uncomfortable and girlfriends are mean to me and laugh at my awkwardness when I beg out of a photo or tell them I dont want them to pick out a dress for me. There has never been a space I can talk about shame feeling uncomfortable in my own skin guilt anger depression or the real sense that there is actually a hardcore social stigma to being a virgin especially if you truly have other things going against you socially that follow you through life. I am at  where even lessthantoaveragely attractive friends were at about.... . Its a huge deal for me but the world at large doesnt give a shit or count the leaps Ive made for myself. Since I looked up and realized Fuck Im out of college and no longer have an easy place to meet people my age or to find friends my standards in men have changed my understanding of sex and what I have the right to ask for as a human being as changed. Through all of it Id say this is the only place where I feel comfortable talking to women about being invisible to mostlymentally stable men I find intellectually and physically attractive conflicts with my own desires social isolation...all that shit. No one else knows. This is the only place I might trust to come if someone were attracted to me to ask for advice and hope it didnt sound like I was bragging. Its not that women in the other femaledominated spaces arent nice or thoughtful but I just cant identify that much with people who talk about having a boyfriend like you can go pick one up at the store even though with age Ive been able to imaginevividlywhat a fucking joy it would be to be valued by men and what a pain in the ass it would be for example to live with someone. I cannot identify with a lot of sexual discussion of prudishness even though I consider myself a sexpositive person. I will say thisI dont let the sense Im FA keep me from...testing the waters asking for help in the voice of a late bloomer.But I can talk about my misgivings in this subreddit where I cant anywhere else.

But unfortunately my mother is very passive. She doesnt really help me unless I come to her for it. Plus she works very hard at her job and comes home exhausted more often than not.
