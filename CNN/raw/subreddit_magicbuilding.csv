Trade them?The first question I am constantly asking myself in medieval fantasy is How does having access to powerful magic change the world? You said anyone can use magic. For most real societies magic might be used to bolster crop yields and heal disease. Things that would help them survive day to day. So how do mages fit in with everyone else?A smaller question when you summon something with Arcane magic where does it come from?,magicbuilding,chky14u,1,t5_30kv1

2470450,0,t1_cmgx7c1,Well there are also anarchists the anarchists would gladly eat you but theyd also gladly eat a goat instead. More nutrition than stringy humans they dont squeal as nicely though. Sacrificing a screaming goat to a demon is the best thing to do. And right wingers who believe in lassiez faire where you operate outside of the unions and you are responsible for your contract with the demon and your own safety let the buyer beware. But if youre smart these can pose no or even less danger than the unionized demons. Sometimes the unions have hidden clauses inside the sign in forms that are less the pleasant or the demons end up with a bit too much bargaining power than the humans would like.As for the floating cities it easier to fly a city than it is to run a sky rig. In some mountainous areas people can have the thread spinning machines at ground level because of elevation. People also run sky rigs which are thread spinners levitated by the same mechanism as the cities. However both the thread spinners and the levitation devices need maintenance and its a bit easier to do that if you have a city built around it.,magicbuilding,cmh1ori,1,t5_30kv1
2832412,0,t3_2s4gfe,I absolutely love hard magic. The thing I like about is that if I come up with a good magic system I can branch out to other areas and then easily flesh out other things such as wordbuilding characters and plot.Lets say our magic system please forgive the silly example revolves around eating cakes. Different cakes give you different abilities. The more sugar is in them the more powerful they are.That gives us three or more Im just lazy to properly think about it elements of worldbuilding  everything revolves around sugar trade maybe there is some sect called Black Sugars or Blacks which tries to experiment with old formulas and come up with more efficient sugar maybe this sugar corrupts its users  therefore Black  Chefs will probably be very respected. Maybe theyll even rule some countries. Best part is you wont have gender inequality anymore cause anyone can cook right?  Cities shape of which is reminiscent of cakes different floors etc. to honor the Almighty SugarlordFlanlordPeople that are despised are the ones that have Diabetes and cant properly experience the magnificent taste of magnificent cake whatever. For funs sake lets make Diabetes more common in this world. And Diabetics could be slaves of the rulling class Master Chefs Cakemakers. Only Cakemakers can provide them with temporary cure so the Diabetics must serve them.You know what? Lets call sugar the White Powder. Yes. And Black sugar powder can be secretly salt which gives different abilities to the user.And why its only cakes that give special abilities? Maybe its their shape.   Eating ovalshaped cake makes you depending on which powder you use  black or white lighter or heavier  Eating rectangularshaped cake  able to survive long periods of time without eating  WHITE     you become very hungry its easier for you to build muscles  BLACK  Triangleshaped  Dont know... maybe your farts smell more?Of course you can combine the floors and shapes but only Master Chefs can do this. There would have to be lot of other limitations but you get the idea.Power of every ability depends on the size of the cake.Now characters and plot.Our main character is Diabetic. He is the son of very powerful Cakelord. He was exiled when they found out about his illness. His love for cooking cakes is unmatched. But every grain of... eh... sugar is killing him. Between slave labours he must find a way to cure his illness. One day a mysterious gentleman in black offers him a job. To cook  with salt that is the banned Black Powder. With it he will lead a rebellion against the rulling class blahbalhbalh Dark Lord blahlabal moustache twirlingOf course darker forces are gathering in the background.

2892215,0,t1_cnwss38,gt if you see a person saying an incantation to cast a fireball an implicit corollary you believe in is that you cant cast a fireball without that incantation.Thats a matter of difference in our conworlds almost no one uses incantations or the other accoutrements of magic in Beliefomancys conworld due to historical and cultural stuff. And if youre teaching a student you would explain that the magic you use is a law of the universe and is not unique to yourself. Plus you could even lie and tell them that they are some great powerful prodigy foretold in prophecy and sought after for so long.And odd powers are actually pretty much universal in my conworld finding a group of people who are what we would think of as normal is actually completely impossible. In some regions people walk on walls and not the floors in others rocks float about ignoring normal gravity etc.The abilities that Beliefomancy is used to create do tend to be more passive longlasting abilities though making muscles larger making magic shoes making a magic sword that sort of thing. You seem to have more flashy instantaneous effects like fireballs. In Beliefomancy to cause an explosion youd probably want something that looked like an explosive device saturate it with the belief that it is then just set it off rather than trying to conjure fire from the air directly.gt Which means gravity determines what you believe and so your belief wouldnt change how gravity works.I shouldve given a more thorough example there.Its a common misunderstanding that heavy objects fall faster than lighter objects therefore it is likely that in many regions of the world of beliefomancy heavy objects do actually fall faster than lighter objects. Things of that sort. Some ancient greek philosophers thought that there was a correlation between air and space because they didnt have access to the vacuum of outerspace they assumed that air was the medium that filled the whole universe what we think of as spacetime was to them just air. Other ancient greek philosophers were convinced that motion was impossible since their thoughts about the natural laws came entirely from armchair argumentation and not practical experimentation odd beliefs were quite common. These sorts of things are what I meant.I mean I suppose in that case it wouldnt be likely that someone would argue something impossible all motion is impossible and actually truly really believe it deep down but an elderly statesman and philosopher teaching that to younger men over time it could acquire some weight. Though that particular belief seems quite... Difficult to imagine being actualized. I think he was actually using it as a basis for some sort argument and not an end in itself though. Maybe arguing that the world doesnt follow any rational laws or something.The history of philosophy has some good stuff on early philosophers its where the majority of my knowledge of Greek philosophy comes from.gt Yes but I have something in my setting not sure if you have anything analogous called the Axiom of Derogation of Faith see link. Basically the models knowing that she only appears glossy because of makeup and her knowing that viewers wouldnt know that means that her disbelief outweighs the faith of all the viewers.I seee... That makes a lot more sense now. Yeah thats a huge difference in our systems.My whole system is based upon creating an utterly insane and nearly incomprehensible world so it lacks any limitations of that sort. Things go very haywire all the time.In Beliefomancy people actually create belief and it comes out of them and into the world saturating the world around them and the belief is actually a thing located in the world not in peoples minds. So its hard for one person to outdo many people because the sum of the belief against them outweighs what they individually can put out. Though in a oneonone contest the stronger believer will win. So a celebrity cant individually do anything about the beliefs targeting them.A naive formula would just assume that everyone has the same weight so like if she believes her makeup is actually makeup then thats  belief in that direction. If one person looks at her and thinks the opposite the two beliefs clash basically canceling out reverting to the default the natural laws so the makeup is makeup. But then if one other person thinks its not it suddenly isnt. You can think of the belief saturation like clouds of energy coming out of people. Its actually much more complicated since it falls off over a distance and the people believe the things at different magnitudes. And cause like a model might not be thinking about the fact that her makeup is just makeup and isnt how she actually looks whereas the people gawking at her are specifically contemplating her appearance and coming to believe things about it.In your system the faith exists entirely in peoples minds. Its an interesting difference I hadnt even considered having it work that way. It does make a lot of differences. Like in this setting if you go to a place that no ones visited in a long time not knowing what to expect youll find the remnants of whatever beliefs last shaped the place maybe faded somewhat over time whereas in your Faith system the belief dies with the persons mind.I havent quite decided on the rules for it but like if you go far away from other people and then create a magical object by saturating it with belief and then bring it into an area where its magic wouldnt normally work it does continue to function. So its possible to just go to a place where creating new magic is easy then make some new magic then bring it back to civilization with you. Having followers along makes it easier to accrue the necessary saturation for this to work and after other people see the magic already working theyll help keep it going. I think it would be a bit wobbly at first when you brought it to new people and a new area maybe the saturation would be bleeding out of it but it can work. It would be a lot easier if you could spread rumors of the thing so that people are already doubtful and halfexpecting to see the thing working.I hope OP doesnt mind that Im like completely going off topic and discussing my own system.,magicbuilding,cnwukar,1,t5_30kv1
2984957,0,t1_co7bw8o,I made a comment here on another thread that fleshes thing out a bit more. Sorry about the format its really just what I wrote down while brainstorming and reading a few online articles.  Alchemy is a skill and nonmagic users can practice it since they attempt to unlock magical properties from inside matter and living beings. Its still very complicated and the tools required are expensive which makes alchemy not too accessible to just anyone. What I meant was specifically death magic. List you cant just go poof your dead but as you said you can kill with magic. EDIT Decided to add the points I added in the linked post here so everything is in one place.  I probably shouldnt have used the word soul it was just how I kind of saw it in my head but its not the same. Basically when the gods created all of the creations on earth they had to give up a part of themselves with each creation. More complex creations also demanded more out of them sentient races being the most complex of all. At the beginning no creature had the power to use the energy for themselves but eventually the gods granted a few the capability to channel their energy to help the gods and the protect all of creation. These powers ended up being hereditary though not all generations had their magic users its still rare and unpredictable.   Crystals came about when the very rock itself was created near the start. They made it quick and shaped it but in doing so their magic spread unevenly and created high energy pockets that coalesced into solid crystal. The gods didnt intend the people to use them for what they would eventually be used for and the gods never bothered fixing it. In the same energy but in a different form.    For magic users all they need to their will to concentrate and channel their inner energy. Depending on the strength of a given spell it takes more concentration and more time. Crystals or other beings can act as conduits to channel their energy through and to boost their skills which helps to cast stronger spells faster. Nonmagic users need crystals to channel their energy through.    All living things have a limited amount of power that can be replenished over time by eating drinking and resting reabsorbing energy from other things into them. If you over do it though its possible that youll never regain all the potential you once had to the point of possibly using the inherent ability. Crystals also have limited power but unlike living beings their power doesnt replenish and will eventually be depleted.    The magic is basically the manipulation on elements. The basic things all people learn first in magic is manipulating objects from a distance. Elemental magic eventually comes in when you can manipulate on tiny things like air or water. Healing magic comes about when you learn to fix the body. It requires medical knowledge to know what youre doing but if youre good enough to can seal wounds that go through the body. Transformation is somewhat of a subset of healing in that you can physically manipulate parts of the body to your will. You could do it to the extent that you make a body completely change in appearance. Transmutation works by changing the composition of the elements to your choosing. One important thing though is nothing can be created everything has to be done with whats there. So if someone lost an arm unless they have that arm in relative good health not decayed then that arm is gone. Transmutation Im a bit hesitant on keeping in my magic system just because I see too many problems with it. One idea I had was that it can change phases of elements like water to ice or steam or even change hard rock into sediments. There wouldnt be the ability to change lead to gold for example. Finally necromancy works a bit in a way where you could control someones body. You are manipulating their physical form to move and act in a certain way. This demands constant concentration but for necromancy one thing thats been done it to animate a corpse then put a crystal inside to sustain the spell.  Alchemy works by using the energy stored within everything. They need to do different processes to release the energy from its physical form and thats what the study is about. What energy to get from where how to get it and how to use it. Potions are made by combining ingredients in a certain way before activating it which makes the substance release magical energy. Different types of potions do different things. For example a potion to manipulate fire will only work as long as you have the substance inside you. Once it goes through the system its over. Its possible to inject it into the blood stream but that could cause brain damage. Potions like healing potions have a permanent effect for example if you have a cut on your arm the potion will mend you arm as long as its inside you and once its gone well your arm is still healed.    The limitations exist for  main reasons. The first is that the power they have is already quite limited since they are given such a small amount of what the gods could do. The second simply goes back to my phenomena of overuse and overexposure that would just end up killing people who would try to do anything too powerful.   Magic is viewed quite differently depending on the cultures. Some see them as reincarnated gods and worship them. Some fear them and kill anyone who shows the innate ability to use magic. Some end up as priests or priestesses and live their whole lives devout to religion. Some become kings or leaders either because magic users are seen as higher beings or because they are simply stronger and overpower the previous ruler. Its very varied and I think Ill have that much more fleshed out when I get the individual cultures of my world fleshed out. ,magicbuilding,co7dz97,1,t5_30kv1

The technology of the mundane world could be run from these magical practices ie engines powered by fire runes. Perhaps the artifacts are relics from the island that somehow fell to earthThe same processes used by the ground world could theoretically be used by the islanders but would be of such little use compared to their natural abilities that they dont often bother.

That cost may not look like its much especially since that effect to wears off after hour or two in most cases but it can be dangerous if heshe is in the middle of something important like surgery or combat. Also some clever people figured that it makes nice antidepressant.Other thing with cost in alchemy is increasing ones power.

It could be that their sister was raped at a party and they lived through that experience with her. It doesnt have to be true  A person could be a great liar because they were poor and had an average life but dreamed of this big adventure they went on and that is how they see themselves. It doesnt have to be something everyone else knows. Bob still works his forty hour week but his good investments and planning mean he has already hit his target money for retirement.

Aberration being of many souls were able to maintain a somewhat normal mental state while a normal person will get stuck in an unending routine. A few Aberration societies did pop up during this time. Before the Age of Ends when thing were normal there were no Aberration societies. They were somewhat accepted in traditional society tolerated so long as they dont make a scene.On the second half Aberration are essentially packs made between different mages. There isnt an Aberration community that looks out for each other beyond that feral Aberrations are very dangerous. Even other Aberration would struggle to kill or contain them.gt Are there aberations that can only form from already demented and twisted souls only ever there to cause harm?Aberrations are created when several mages make a pact and fuse their souls. Their persona heavily depends on the personalities of those mages. If they were cruel and heartless than the persona will be cruel and heartless. If the mages were considerate the persona will be considerate. ,magicbuilding,dfryb7m,1,t5_30kv1
