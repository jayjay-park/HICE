6321400,0,t3_427csj,My father received this as a wedding gift in the mid s from a wealthy friend of his. No paperwork came with it so I am pretty sure it would be impossible to prove this was actually the home run ball but any way I could get some opinions on the signature and possibly if it is the correct type of ball that was used in the mid s?Just some info on the home run I have been able to find. The home run happened on May th  in Atlanta. It was a one run walk off home run with one out in the bottom of the th. The pitcher was Jim Lonborg who actually started the game and pitched into the th inning. The Braves only had  hits that day and it would have been Aarons th dinger of the year. Ive included two other pictures of the ball with the other markings but it is very difficult to read since the ball is over  years old. From what I can distinguish the second picture saysOfficial BallAmerican LeagueSignature Pres.The third picture says The Cushioned Core Center with the word REACH in the baseball symbol. Underneath it says Made in the USA then something but finishes with Spalding.Ive grown up staring at this ball for hours and hours and based on other signatures of Aarons on other balls Ive googled there are SOME similarities between the signatures. The loop in the H and the capital A seem to match but I know its difficult to write on the curved surface of the ball. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I dont know how to format this so I apologize if it is confusing but hopefully the pictures will help follow along.,AutographAssistance,cz869iv,1,t5_2yr4i
