7236915,0,t1_d1zufdi,You obviously didnt read the post.  Nonviolent protests force reaction from the state by targeting oppressive laws or injustices. The injustices supported by the state are supported by their power and therefore require their reaction to maintain. You also act as if the British Raj in India and the US Government for MLK who came after Gandhi and therefore had ample history to work from didnt think of any of the things you mentioned to combat nonviolent protests. Fool me once... was Gandhi fool me twice was MLK. Nice idea though.,Nonviolence,d20s9nw,2,t5_2sci3
