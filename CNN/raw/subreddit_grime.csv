4796042,0,t3_3gjqkp,People think youre trolling because most fans of grime would not identify at all with brotastic the song you have linked was quite good imo but I dont think it is very well known it is very different to most grime tracks and people wont appreciate you calling grime a genre under edm. If I was going to use the name edm I would not think of grime as part of that. To me edm is more continental style dance music grime may have superficial similarities in production but the core sound and the culture are very different. Also if youre disappointed in the responses you have got so far bear in mind that you posted this at am UK time.Ok so that was quite a unique blend in my experience it had the poppy chorus quite gritty bars and then a very electronic instrumental which Im guessing is the bro part?. Most grime instrumentals are pretty different to this the few that I have heard that match this bro instrumental sound tend to belong to songs that are more energetic than the quite gritty sound marger has produced most gritty tracks have more old school grime instrumentals. The song I have most confidence in you liking is Chill Out amp Relax by Newham Generals and a lot of the songs from their  star general ep are similar my favourite is Percy Newham Generals are composed of D Double E and Footsie Going from the tone of Rain I think you might also like Bugzy Malone who is a relatively new up and comer in the grime scene Getting a bit closer to normal Grime but still with a touch of bro to the instrumental Frisco Going by what you said about chilling and driving Ive got to include Devlin and Hes also done tonnes of grittier stuff if you wanna go looking for that If you want to know what proper grime sounds like for me this song is that absolute constitution of grime Roll Deep Or another classic and I had to to get him on the list JME JME has also done more modern grime There is also what to me is a completely other side of grime which is probably my favourite. Man like Chronik and repping patois grime Riko Dan So far I havent mentioned Wiley anything like enough given he basically invented grime and imo has led it ever since to me he is an actual god of music. Gonna list a few of his tracksThe other leading MC in grime is Skepta he seems pretty popular with Americans Ghetto needs a mention As Does Kano And Dizzee to be fair he probably deserves a lot more than just a mention Oh and Lethal Bizzle! I also wanna mention Ruff Sqwad specifically I should probably stop now...More music I like to chill to in the car I guess most people would say this is UK Hip Hop not grime gotta mention Klashnekoff ,grime,ctz2vys,2,t5_2rmgg

KampK are rappers who even though they started out making grime are now definitely rappers. The key difference is the flow and the beat but also your actions song structure. Grime beats are different musically to hip hop trap. the place where it gets confusing is because some grime macs al make raptrap songs such as it aint safe. However shutdown or know me from i hope you can see the beat and the flow used is way different to a rappers flow. hope that helps,grime,cxn6wi2,7,t5_2rmgg

I was one of those kids that took up posting fuck kanye whenever he did something. I was just not initiated into rap and I perpetuated it until around the end of highschool and college where I learned about rap some more. At this point all I listened to was buckethead. Flash forward about  years its   I get into producing on fl studio getting into dubstep. And then the arrival of trap pretty much sold me and I was into it now. So now being into rap I started to look around for intelligent rap which led me to find some rap battles and at the time dont flop was poppin on YouTube and with the language intrigue I started to get into UK hip hop.

10737880,0,t1_ddnh54e,People go about how pk and merky are the best of the new school and how they have the best flows and how they should blow up etc. but in reality pks not even the best in ygg and just cause he has a different flow doesnt mean its the best. The same goes for merky a bit but what I dont understand is how people like to voluntarily listen to his voice sounds like nails on chalkboard. Then his fans go around saying he shouldve blown instead of insert a successful grime artist. What comes to president in my opinion his lyrics and rhyme scheme are extremely basic yet he gets hailed especially here as one of the bests lately. Hes an okay mc but i guess the unique flow makes people rate him more.,grime,ddnj4xj,5,t5_2rmgg

10915308,0,t1_de4mstn,yeah there are a lot of things about the video and the lyrics and some of the phrases that are directly taken from a whole slew of american artists. I actually kind of think its cool because hes definitely doing his thing about it. At the same time you can totally see how much American Hip Hop and Rap he listens to and how much hes drawn from it stylistically. Also its a sick tune. ,grime,de5u4us,6,t5_2rmgg

11051234,0,t1_dekmc9i,After leaving The Square he started experimenting with new sounds forming new crews and labels performing a lot producing a lot of music. But he hasnt been releasing or going on sets and when he has the bars have been old.  was very quiet from him. But I do think hes been putting a lot of work behind the scenes and will hit the scene hard this year with a lot of new ideas and possibly an album. I think its too soon to say hes fallen off because weve not seen him do his thing yet. If his new content flops then Id agree but youve got to let him release proper things first.,grime,dekmzlj,17,t5_2rmgg
