10801678,0,t1_ddu15p3,Yeah the Power Fist does triple duty as a powerful T weapon shield AND Grappling tool so I wouldnt think it was unfair if it used Melee Weapons for attacking. The only slightly strange fallout from that I see from that is that you dont get to use the Fist for submission hold damage since it only does your unarmed damage.Which isnt too much of a problem for the Lancer using it with his d P fists  Strength and Ascetic powers....,emissaryrpg,ddu47qu,1,t5_3h01e
