9487306,0,t3_5ampz9,This is great! Thanks!I have scoured the dark corners of the internet to find something similar  there is some quite good information available out there for a power grid aficionado such as myself but I have yet to find one as comprehensive and nice to navigate as this. There are some obvious flaws in the information but I dont even care.Thanks for sharing!,Grid_Ops,d9iihv8,2,t5_37pda
9793674,0,t1_dajxc8j,Cool! Thanks that is the kind of answer I was looking for. I assumed that in order to make the energy  capacity market final outcome be roughly equivalent to our current energy only market it would have to either come with restrictions on realtime offer behavior through prescriptive rules or some sort of financial exposure to the spot index to encourage variable cost bidding. Should definitely be an interesting process. Capacity markets seem so complicated when compared to our current realtime only energyonly what you see is what you get model. Basically when supply cushion falls to sub  and you and pushing out MWs you  you get rewarded through scarcity pricing.  How do you guys ever get prices anywhere near your cap andor what is the point of a price cap if everyone must offer basically at cost. Is it all dispatchable loads curtailing in  range per MW then?,Grid_Ops,daka6hm,2,t5_37pda
