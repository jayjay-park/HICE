Windsor lacks in Quality Steak houses imo so the Keg especially the downtown one wins by default sometimes. I found Neros to be salty like crazy.Also I find that the Keg overcooks steak if you want medium then order medium rare.If your cooking at home Costco carries good strip loin steaks that I turn out much better than a steak at the Keg. ,windsorontario,cgs8h6y,1,t5_2s68p

3188355,0,t3_2wl494,This is a common news story.  I would suggest that for the majority of Canadians a devalued dollar is not a good thing.  All of your assets are now worth less.  Your RRSP savings your house your liquid cash are worth less.  In just a few years the value of these things has dropped near .  If it was possible you could have traded your mortgage for American dollars  years ago and bought the same mortgage back today for nearly  less.  Your  house would be worth  American dollars.  Who this does benefit is business owners who are dependant on crossborder traffic such as a Casino or a tourist attraction.  It also benefits businesses that sell resources to Americans.  The trees for example still grow the same but are now worth more money.  It also makes businesses that are up for sale more attractive to American dollars.  These things rarely benefit the average Canadian.So next time you read about a low dollar being a good thing maybe ask who is telling you this and why?,windsorontario,cosh1eq,3,t5_2s68p

7142298,0,t3_4d1hrm,What youre referring to is popularly called Norberts Gambit but yeah if you dont even have the necessary accounts already the basic know how and are exchanging small amounts theres probably better ways to go about this.For day to day spending or occasional trips simply get a credit card that doesnt charge any foreign currency fees.Most credit cards might give you a good initial exchange rate but the vast majority of them will tack on a  fee. Its the same thing at banks or other places. Either they get you with a currency exchange fee or they just plain give you a not great rate called the spread. There are some credit card outliers though that do not charge such a high fee or none at all. So you pay just the current MasterCard or Visa exchange rate between CAD and USD which is usually very good compared to many other sources. Of the various analysis I have seen the MC and Visa CADUSD conversions has been found to be quite close to the spot rate most of the time. Thats far better than what youll get a bank or the train station.Examples of nolow currency exchange fee credit cards that I know of. fee Tangerine Money Back fee Amazon.ca Visa fee Rogers Bank MasterCard fee Chase Marriott VisaId look at the benefits of each and use whichever would benefit you the most.I personally use the Amazon.ca card since it was the first Canadian card that came to my attention with no currency exchange fees. They offer  cash back in the form of a bill credit in  increments so the currency exchange rate gets even better when considering that.Speaking of saving money another easy way to save on cross border shopping trips is to get a NEXPRESS prepaid toll card. Even if you dont have a NEXUS card to use the actual NEXUS lanes you can still use the NEXPRESS toll lanes to pay and at a lower rate. Use it with some form of cash back credit card and again the deal is even better aside from saving time.,windsorontario,d1q04oe,1,t5_2s68p
