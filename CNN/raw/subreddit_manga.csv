31404,0,t1_cehysdh,That doesnt even make any sense. gt has appeared naked on certain occasions. While it wasnt forced its still fanserviceSo from this we can conclude that according to your definition fanservice is nudity. gt even though its not for the sake of fanservice.So what youre saying is its not nudity for the sake of nudity.Personally I would define fanservice as nudity or on most occasions sexualized presentation of bodies for the sake of itselfand thus the fans who are being served that way. Remember that the term is made up of  actual english words that werent chosen at random. Also realize that actual fanservice does not usually impact the storyits an addon in a way. In Berserk we dont get assangles or boobcloseups from the perspective of a pervcam we see what the actual characters see with the same emphasis. So any nudity that we encounter is experienced in the same way by the characters and actually has an impactlong rape scene REALLY FUCKING DISTURBED Gutts and especially Casca. Also consider that for the large majority of shows you can clearly say yeah it has a medium amount of fanservice etc. or while watching there we go fanservice episode or the wind blowing up the skirts classic fanservice while for Berserk you have to argue the definition of fanservice to get evidence of it containing any fanservice at all.If you wanna define fanservice as just nuditysexualized presentation then sure Berserk has fanservice. SexEd education books have fanservice then too. That kind of definition just doesnt make much sense to me because it disregards the meaning of the two words the term is made up of and also makes it rather obsolete.,manga,cei09kf,2,t5_2ql0i

Slightly disappointing but still happy that he became a chef.Though the ending was rushed with the last few weeks left and the announcement that KNIM would be ending in a few chapters I couldnt possibly seeing a great ending but a decent ending.

304744,0,t1_cfc89lu,I know from attending panels of web comic authors in the states the joke was they make more money on selling TShirts then selling the comics. This was true for a punk band coworker that I worked with. He joked he performed music so he could sell punk shirts.As for books I feel like it is a lost cause in the United States doing things traditionally. The retailers  book stores only pay for items they sell and not what they stock publishers even have to pay to have books returned after sitting on the shelf for a while. It was easier for a publisher to destroy books instead of getting them returned to minimize the loss.  Comic Book Stores operate differently  support your local comic book store!. Due to the storage space and how fast inventory can be sold printing a book can be a costly amp risky. Only sane thing to do is publish as a crowd funded project or only print when a certain number of preorders were made. Print on Demand costs more to produce due to volume and labor. Most people would complain about the price as they will be compare them to mass produced books.I am curious if there is another way to help artists out besides affiliate banner clicks and merchandising. ,manga,cfccr6w,3,t5_2ql0i

690738,0,t3_2209b4,This chapter is probably one of the most infuriating Ive read throughout the entire series.The whole brothers reincarnated bullshit is totally unnecessary and only adds the whole shitlist of powerups that make everything else irrelevant.What do I mean? Well lets look at Sage mode. Oh yeah that thing that Naruto trained his ass off for only for it to become irrelevant except for that one instance where only Senjutsu would work on Madara. He got the Kyuubi mode fully under control? Wow! Too bad hes never going to use that again since he now has all the Bijuu along with whatever reincarnation bullshit well see next.Dont get me wrong I still love Naruto and itll always have a special place in my heart but this chapter was downright disgusting. It sounded like some tweenage kid wrote some shitty fanfiction out there and Kishimoto decided to go along with it for April Fools. Going back to read the earlier chapters of Naruto made me really realize how stupid and pulledoutofhisass this whole thing really is. Sorry for the whole rant but it just grinds my gears how this whole series is deteriorating.

709403,0,t1_cgkw1nq,Wait you just supported my point. Otakus are a casual market. Theyre not terribly discerning consumers. Im a huge manga fan but I would never consider myself an otaku. Otakus are the people who buy things just because theyre Japanese. Thats who the Capitalist market targets. We dont get rereleases of Tezukas Phoenix despite the fact its a billion times better than The World God Only Knows because the market is dictated by people who think an essential characteristic of manga is giant glistening eyes. Capitalism doesnt describe like a specific society its a method of market regulation. Two kids who each have their own lemonade stand on opposite sides of the street are a form of Capitalism.gt so I really have no idea but I still think its harsh to call it bad.I dont want to be that guy but I study comics. Like academically. Attack on Titan isnt bad like some guy drawing with crayons bad but I think they pushed the author to make a series too soon and it ended up being kind of a joke. The anime has good production values because they have a seasoned staff that opening is badass but its already buckling under the weight of the amateur plot and undirected narrative. ,manga,cgkwunu,4,t5_2ql0i

Naruto has really strayed the path of Fairy Tail friendship is now a confirmed power indicator and I do not like that at all. Bleach is a hollow Manga I dont feel for hardly any of the characters the scenery is big empty white space and there have been so many reveals even the WOW factor is gone for me oh and the villains came out of nowhere so I dont care for anything that happens.So if OP is a  Id give Naruto  and Bleach  depending on the chapter.,manga,cgxwn9y,8,t5_2ql0i

906187,0,t3_24hlii,Bleach and One Piece  Bleach for obvious reasons I may wait until it finishes before picking it back up one piece because despite what everyone says I think that it does get pretty draggy and theres way too many characters that the author digs up from the past that I forgot about and just become clueless may pick it up again.Air Gear  I dropped it before many people did but I havent heard many good things about it anywayInitial D  it gets way too long and too many chapters on one race at times its much bette to watch the anime I guess but Ive only seen the movies. I understand that the focus is street racing but I feel that where I read up to there is a distinct lack of focus on the lives of the characters themselves and instead its just Project D challenging team after team repetitively.Fairy Tail  this just got draggy and repetitive also Rave Master had much better story tellingSkip Beat!  just got boring. It lost appeal quite quickly.Attack on Titan  I havent technically dropped this series as I still read it but very reluctantly I started off watching the anime and it started off amazing it was a  sort of  fresh idea for the genre and the drama and emotion in it was so deep but soon after I dropped the anime because SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT CAUGHT UP the chasing of the female Titan just dragged on for  to  episodes which I felt was unnecessary so I picked up the manga from that point onwards but the manga also had a slightly slow pace and I feel as if the excitement I had at the start is slowly dissipating. ,manga,ch7af3m,3,t5_2ql0i

I couldnt even begin to guess how it would end. I just got fed up reading long ass paragraphs for games where the rules didnt matter to me because I could never make any assumptions on what would happen.Mysterious Girlfriend X  Nothing happened. It was just a guy hanging out with his weird girlfriend. Also it took too long to come out. Its not UxU Im not gonna wait patiently for years for an okay manga.Hajime No Ippo  I thought the main character was going to grow older and look different over time. He did not. That was the main reason as to why I wanted to read it.Nisekoi  Too many new girls who have a claim to being the girl hes looking for. Too little answered questions. Almost gaglike.Gamaran  It never got to the fight that I wanted. Assassination Classroom  I stopped understanding what was going on after a while.Attack on Titan  I got bored.

Many magazines operate online versions through this portal including Comic Rex Manga Time KR I think etc.SquareEnix also runs Gangan Online which has things like WataMote among others.Then there are many many Japanese sites offering official ebooks of manga and light novels. Amazon Japan Honto HMV etc.Since I import all of my print volumes through Honto I also use their ebook service for light novels since I need the OCR cheat for some of the kanji    And they allow overseas purchases whereas Amazon Japan doesnt. Honto offers constant specials on their ebooks too they almost give them away. Constant x point sales on ebooks pretty much. That you can stack with the pt bonus for spending yen. Pretty much get everything at half price then.Only caveat is the light novel ebooks dont come with the illustrations its the text only.

Now the grocery store wouldnt buy the newspaper to redistribute if there were no profit in it  after all they would just be wasting money.Now replace newpaper with child pornography and the grocery store with the people producing it.Yes you are right  There is nothing wrong with purchasing a newspaper. Congratulations! However context is an important part of understanding so if we consider that you were you to commit such an act would be actively encouraging and aiding the production of something so reprehensible wouldnt it be logical to allow the law a way to counteract the behavior at both ends of the problem?

She is not clingy she is just an individual who knows herself so well that she has completely understood what she wants to do with her life and has take the full inititive to achive her desire. Not only has she taken the inititive to do so she is highly capable when it comes down to it to succeed in her mission. So in a sense you could call her commited instead of blindly following. Something about a woman who knows what she wants and is willing to do the dirty work to get it done has one hell of an appeal level. Hell I would say its more than Queens given the fact her lackies per say do most of her grunt work for her. Her familycompanymoney gives her her power not her herself.

1591226,0,t3_2chw8i,Manga that are in your line of preference along with a comparison of your favorite manga alongside it as a comparison Berserk A lot like GANTZ in that anyone could die. People are very expendable. There is a lot of fighting against otherworldly forces and at times it seems almost impossible that the hero will ever find peace for himself or his friends. Many comrades die many are made many enemies must be vanquished. Very very very heartfelt and brutal. Liar Game Like Death Note and Monster in that both are very psychological and have characters trying to outthink each other with very high stakes involved Elfen Lied Like Deadman Wonderland a bit. Elfen Lied has lots of fan service and nudity but if you look past it is also very heartbreaking and really highlights the insanity and brutality of people as well as how far someone can go before they completely snap and start massacring people. Also mutants. Future Diary Like Death Note and Deadman Wonderland. A lot of psychological chess games and a lot of mentally disturbed people playing them along with each player having a special ability and trying to compete with each other for a grand prize Battle Royale A little like Deadman Wonderland where there are a lot of sick and twisted individuals running around and also like GANTZ where above all things its about survival. Basically about a class of kids that have to fight to the death on an island. A lot of nudity sex violence and generally disturbed individuals taking the lead over the main characters with their sociopathy depravity and manipulation,manga,cjfqtln,1,t5_2ql0i

1633852,0,t3_2d0tua,hunter x hunter this is a classic and the author just started updating again too. It has a really neat story and is like a paranormal action manga. One of my favorite mangas of all time. they have a newly remade anime as well if you wanna watch instead of read it.Magi This is also a good action manga with a good balance of comedy. It does have some dark tones too. I really like it alot. Plenty of chapters which is niceFeng Shen Ji This one is an action manga with the whole deal with gods and humans...Assasination Classroom its a pretty light hearted manga and a lot of the characters are fun to read about still has some cool action bits in it as well... love all the charactersTokyo Ghoul this one is a bit on the dark side with a ton of blood and stuff but i find the storyline interestingDice the cube that changes everything this one is about how a person uses dice to kinda raise his stats like in an rpg... there is alot of psychological stuff in it where we see how different people react to these dice...Black Haze the artwork isnt the best but the story is about magicians and stuff... plus the MC is kind of a badassBut you really are missing out on some good ones here are some short ones if you wanna have a goMx it is  chapters and it is completed so even though it doesnt fit the criteria this is a must read. It is about magic and is comedy oriented so it is a real blast... the story seems a bit cliche but it really does make a difference in the storyline. It is one of those mangas that definitely deserves more chaptersDrifters very interesting storyline and great artwork it was done by the same author as hellsing... its set in this fantasy world that has dragons and stuff like that but the twist is that this man sends all these historical figures to this time to help fight the scourge. so you end up seeing historical figures like Hannibal oda nobunaga and hitler... i think its really cool!!!Gate Thus the JSDF fought there This one is a very original and interesting storyline. Though it has a sense of humor there is also a very dark political side to it as wellDungeon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatte Iru Darou ka i know that its a long title but its a manga that is pretty new and is very rpglike... i think it has some good potential.,manga,cjl41l3,4,t5_2ql0i

The characters are interesting the relantionship between the main guy and girl is well made  for the type of series it is  and the small cast of supporting characters is for the most part interesting. I feel the plot towards the end was rushed  Did it get canceled?  but it was still satisfying to read and the ending was powerfull. I found some situations during the series extremely amusing I dont think that was the autor intention for the most part but I had a good laugh. It really is worth a read if you like this kind of series if you dont try it but be carefull because there are some strong scenes in it.Overall   Really good read could have been better with a little more time to wrap everything up.,manga,cjmgdgs,3,t5_2ql0i

1851024,0,t3_2fs1j3,Length. Statistically its hard to sell longer running series unless they are a universal English hit. Your main shounen jump titles for example. Viz struggled getting out the later volumes of Excel Saga and other longer series due to lackluster sales. There are many titles theyve just dropped altogether like Detective Conan and Gintama. Genres. Holyland and SunKen Rock are sports manga. That is the statistically lowest selling manga and anime genres to the English market. Sure there is a fanbase for them online but that rarely ever translates to physical sales. And that both are long its a double nope.Timing. Getting a manga near an anime tiein can boost sales and hype. Announcing big manga happens at big events. Now what event has happened since Tokyo Ghouls anime was partway done? None.

I think your suggestion is very wise and I am for sure considering it but I would also like creative input during the creation process to help me along. It may not even be because I need the help but more so I would like someone else to create something with me.And I do have quite a load of spare time at the moment and I have picked up several manga for dummy style books and such but I always end up lacking motivation to improve my art skills. whereas my mind just bleeds out ideas at an alarmingly unnecessary rate.

If it is your first book to read i do not recommend complex stories nor long stories. uElecNinja recommended Yotsuba which probably in that context is similar to NichijouI just ordered the volume  and am waiting to receive it. There are also some Ghibli books like Howls moving castle which are very easy to read as there are few kanjis and tons of hiraganaa lot easier than for example the manga Haruhis melancholy.

However i do not think it was worth it.  arts takes forever to actually get important to the plot and alot of the action isnt as interesting to me as breaker was. The latest releases were interesting though.In my opinion it is at ths point in time not worth it. It picks up but really slowly and you could actually skip a lot of chapters which are just fillers IMO.Hope i could help.,manga,clo58wv,1,t5_2ql0i

2615076,0,t3_2ptkxb,. I store my manga on shelves that have free space. I got a bunch of them in my old room.. Before I reorganized my shelves to put manga on I had some stuff hidden behind newer volumes.. I dont mind having series hidden.. Yeah I always try to keep series together.. Collecting a lot of ongoing series can be a bit hard on your wallet. But if you budget correctly and plan out releases you could probably be fine.For example Currently the ongoing titles Im collecting are MonsterKnights of Sidonia Attack on Titan and Judge Listed in order of priority. But because Im really busy with school Im behind on all of them for at least a volume. So this is how I planned it out. I will get Monster on preorders. Sidonia and Attack on titan volumes will probably come in February and get Judge and Secret vol. Secret is by the same author until about April. I think there are also some new releases in April and I might get those as well or wait and get them when I purchase a shitload of stuff in JuneJuly when some of the things Im looking forward come out.TLDR Its great you want to plan things out. Set priorities if you are going to start a lot of ongoing series because most likely youre gonna fall behind on some. Also on a side note if you order more things at once online the shipping probably costs less.,manga,cmzxftj,2,t5_2ql0i

2701903,0,t3_2r08aa,I finished reading Gaussian Blur just the other day! I dont tend to read a lot of drama but a couple coming of age stories between adolescentsIts still ongoing and although I tend to be careful about genderbenders often times theyre just dealt stupidly or has too much fanservice this one uses it to make a really interesting plot and you can see the boys start to grow and deal with their emotions.Short and sweet. Its been a while since I read the first few chapters but the last two recently came out and it was super sweet. Its basically kids learning to relate to each other and deal with who they are. Its been a long time since Ive read this but I still love it. Its about a girl who falls in love with a boy whos deaf but plays Japanese drums beautifully. The story follows the ups and down of their relationship and how the main characters grow to communicate with each other. Really lovely.Interesting characters interesting concept brings up interesting questions and leaves space for the characters to do a lot of growing up. It has a similar theme to Gaussian Blur of dreams clashing with reality and kids trying to break free of their difficult lives and is accompanied by very experimental but really nice art.There are probably more Korean webtoons Ive read that I loved but unfortunately havent been officially translated yet but so far these are my favorites.Also my first post hope I didnt do anything wrong!,manga,cnb72fp,2,t5_2ql0i

2705248,0,t1_cnbjuhb,gtI was reading this story  just now and it made me think of how uncomfortable it must be to be stuck in a body youre not comfortable with. If you go to the tumblr page linked on CNN youll see the guy dressed in a skirt. He really wanted to be a girl and it mustve been so tough for him to not be able feel accepted by society.Just a small correction its a she.I mean i know she is transgender and was born a boy but the correct pronoun to not disrespect is hershe. The whole reason she took her life is because her ultrareligious family kept calling her him and son and even after dying her mother kept calling her son.Even the CNN article calls her she.Its an understandable mistake to confuse pronouns like i said its just a small correction to your comment.                                                                    .                            gtFor better or worse theyve built up their lives and it feels like changing back would invalidate that somehow.Eh...they built up their lives based on how the other felt based on what is seen on the middleschool episodes. Yui in Yuutas body told Yuuta  to behave more feminine do girl stuff make female friends and even to not get fat in her body. Yuuta in yuis body told Yui to not make girls fall in love with himhis body and not to behave unusually.They are trying to take care of the life of the other so things wont be complicated once they go back to normal. Thats the logic they use.                                .                            gtIm just not sure how they would go about changing back and if the mangaka can pull that off in a good way. I think that is a taste issue but i can think in a scenario for that to happenThey get into a big fight in school because one of them did something  risky they start blaming each other for everything that has happened and their situation they fall from the stairs and hit their heads just like it happened at the start of the manga. When they wake up they are in their original bodies and thanks to what they did in their opposite bodies make friends help clasmates etc they learn qualities of each other personality. Yui in her original girl body learns to speak her mind more often. Yuuta in his original boy body learns to be more empathetic and to analyze the situation before act.But of course...thats my interpretation of how a happy ending would be.,manga,cnbkrdn,2,t5_2ql0i

2859724,0,t3_2sua72,Look I would suggest you do this if you havent yet picked up the manga. Wait for the anime to air in Spring there will be some really cool battles and its safe to assume they will be more enjoyable in glorious Sidonia CGI then when you finish the anime start the manga from beginning. Or just start the manga now and end at the ch. .Or if you want to spoil yourself some of the action you can read the manga now but again start from the beginning.  chapters isnt that much to read you can do it in a couple of hours if you double down on it or daytwo if you just take some time.The reason you want to read the whole manga is they kind of skippedrushed some info and the fact that manga is made by Tsutomo Nihei whose art is top tier in my opinion.

But that is  off their  markup. So at  spent in a year you merely reach  savings off their markup.Meanwhile Honto and CDjapan dont require any membership for their salespoint earnings and charge base price. Whereas Kino point rewards are good for domestic store sales only.Even with the free shipping you dont come out ahead.EDIT becasual gave me more info about his Kino order from the thread here  volumes were USD.

2945710,0,t3_2tugxb,Both Blade of the Immortal and Vinland Saga are seinen manga for adult men manga. they are probably what you want to keep reading in the future though you may want to try reading some josei manga for adult women every now and then since a few are pretty great as well. Here are some of my recommendations Eden Its An Endless World great scifi story good artwork very human characters Berserk best fantasy manga bar none Dorohedoro this is pretty much the japanese equivalent of indie black and white comics theres nothing really like it out there Vagabond masterfully illustrated comic about one of the most famous japanese swordsmen ever the mcs growth is some of the best development i have read in any comic. its also frequently compared to vinland saga so youll probably like this a lot Bokurano EXTREMELY dark take on the super robot genre might come off as a bit too tryhard to some but most people ive come across loved it and if for example you like Alan Moores stories you may like this Naoki Urasawas works mainly Monster th Century Boys and Pluto. All of them are good th century boys is generally considered his masterpiece. Pluto is my personal favorite bar none of the best scifi comics i have ever read and although its based on astro boy no knowledge of it is necessary to understand it. Me and the Devil Blues Massively underrated manga about Robert Johnson the famous jazz musician. Artwork is stellar the presentation of s america feels very genuine coming from a japanese author and its generally a solid read.

I mean there are certain plot elements and themes that are reused but not to the huge degree. But with very similar art and repeat of the certain themes its not a good idea to read his stuff one after another. You might mix them up in your head.Katsu! is my favorite one of his works. Because its not about baseball and it has probably less repeating themes of Adachis manga. Cross Game is the close second. Then there is Rough and H. Touch Ive read way too long ago.

During that middle third though there were many occasions where I did not understand their actions.

3385031,0,t3_2yy37r,Binge read all of this just now. This manga started off on a weird pace but it got somewhat better later on. Art was nice characters okay. Backstories were fun lol. My favorite parts was how Haru and Natsu got together. The endings Was a little too clean tbh. There wasnt really much leading up to who was the final villain though save for that one school festival chapter. It didnt really feel like a true mystery story in that sense. I also wish there were more explanation on how these powers were acquired and if they ever really were going to kill the users themselves.Overall I felt the execution of the main idea kid spouts flames from his hand could have been better yet I was never bored while reading. Though there was something quite shallow about the plotline and the characters motives so I didnt feel too invested either.     ,manga,cpe4bsg,3,t5_2ql0i

Im an arab myself and I do not see the stereotype of a man with a turban and a camel in the desert as something disturbing. It would be different if they are depicted as terrorists.

So idk if that would make him trans though I dont care about defining it too much in the end haha. I think Mada is at a disconnect of thinking about Hato in those same terms as a dual hetero womanman or actually being attracted to a trap. Your bit about Saki and Mada is so spot on and she never had imo those moments with Kousaka maybe just because hes this weird inhuman being.

In the middle of a battle she stops aimingfiring her bow and stares at Soowon. It isnt until someone calls her attention and breaks the hypoarousal state that she decides to retreat. It is definitely a lesser reaction than other times but I think thats natural for  reasons.  this is the first time she has seen him again when her and her friends lives have been threatened in other ways.  she is developmentally moving forward and not shutting down as far each time she sees him.,manga,cqitkzg,3,t5_2ql0i

I usually read shounenseinen stuff but rarely have I seen a manga that slowly builds the story. I read the first volume and a bit just an fyi dont read this at night cause thats what I did and the end of volume  scared the shit out of me. Cant wait for this to be released as english volumes Prophecy  I picked up all three volumes on a whim because someone mentioned it to me in the past and I am really enjoying this series. Ive read the first volume and I have to say I am digging the story kind of feels like a more realistic version of death note to me. Hopefully the manga ends well. World Trigger Ive been seeing a lot of stuff on this series and over the past few weeks I picked up the first  volumes and started to go through them. Im up to volume  now and I have to say this is quite an interesting manga. It starts off a bit generic but really changes it up around volume  if i remember correctly.

It has  great programs in regards to manga a downloader and a reader. The Manga Downloader is basically a site image ripper theres a selection in there which sites you want to download. It compiles them neatly inside a folder or if you want in a zipz and divides the chapters per folder. The Manga Reader on the other hand compliments the DLer it has a shell integration meaning if you right click a folder it brings up a Read with M Reader which lessens the hassle compared to other apps the other great thing about this is the vertical scrolling. It arranges the whole chapter in a sort of column like a PDF viewer and you just need to scroll downup.

Romance Spoilerss I wouldnt say the romance is developed like that of a romance manga where they become a couple and go on dates and stuff but they get closer towards the end to the point where such a thing might be possible.The changes the anime makes are mostly cosmetic it adds some extra backstory to the minor characters and Tokines involvement in Kokuburous assualt was changed. ,manga,crrx0p5,1,t5_2ql0i

After that a blank period until Yamada meets Shiraishi.We only saw the happy side of Yamadas memories and thats why Sora doesnt want to remember anything more at this point. From Yamada POV if things have continued the same way they were he thinks that theyll be a couple by now. But if they didnt ? Just remind that Yamada remembered only a part and the happiest one. Something fishy mustve happened. Maybe a fight between them lolI feel kind of bad for Sora now that depends why she asked Nancy to erase everyones memories. She had a chance back then and a huge one.

But Hikaru no go might be the only manga I read fan stories for because I wanted to read about Honinbo Hikaru QQ.Biggest dissappoint me for me was Attack on Titan The start was so fucking amazing mindblowingly good. It left little room for going up and lots of potential for going down and it did chapter after chapter month after month the story got convoluted and it lost the chance to become the next Berserk. I stopped reading the same week the Anime started never went back and as someone who rereads EVERYTHING even relatively good it dissappointed me something fierce.

4378090,0,t1_csixz3h,Its kind of difficult to go without electricity nowadays with solar power and wind turbines. They can be setup almost anywhere there is sunlight or a little wind.Although yes if a large solar storm were to hit Earth then there would be no electricity but even a solar super storm wouldnt be able to knock out the power grid from repairing itself in a year. So realistically Id be more worried about staying warm in Canada during winter instead of worrying about manga.Wood stove fireplaces were a thing here but high insurance rates have phased them out in newer homes and theyve been replaced with gas ones. Technically gas ones can be lit with a light and knob but honestly I dont think people are competent enough to do that anymore without blowing up their house.So Im not worried about owning a digital collection of manga. Anyways digital manga isnt widely available legally like online anime is so I prefer to buy the physical copies when I can so I dont feel bad about reading them from the illegal and fan translated sources.Although some manga never get translated so fan translations arent that bad of a thing. Some webtoon artists actually support fan translators and have created a website where fans can translate their work and publish it for people from around the world to read it in almost any language of their choice. Webtoons.com actually does some official English translations so its not all fan translations but a lot of them do have them.,manga,csj5a09,-1,t5_2ql0i

If she kills him the sadness will force her to forget and so Gohongi decides to sacrifice himself for her sake so she can have a chance at a normal life.Its a bit...

4640824,0,t1_ctfj8so,As long as they ask for donations or put ads on their site you cannot claim that theyre doing this as charity. They might not be making much but they sure are trying to make money.The link you gave is nothing but proof that scanlators are in it for the money by the way.Theres something you dont seem to understand everyone here and I mean everyone involved in scanlations even the readers is stealing intellectual property. Scanlators and aggregate sites are trying to profit from the intellectual property whereas me and you just read it so I would argue were actually less bad than they are.Im not going to get into whether or not scanlations are good for advertising for the record I think they are but aggregate sites are the best for advertising so it actually works against your point but my point is that you all need to stop being hypocrites and start understanding that scanlators are profiting off of hardworking artists work.edit I reread your post and theres actually a lot more shit I want to address.Yes scanlators are only marginally less shitty because they technically put in some effort. Aside from the as I said negligible amount of effort they put in theyre exactly the same as aggregators. Some aggregators like mangastream also scanlate their own shit so theyre also equally shitty. mangastream also has the audacity to ask you to turn adblock off because they want it to be absolutely clear that theyre trying to turn profit here. If you think the amount of work scanlators put in is nonnegligible you should consider all the countless Shueisha employees that are responsible for each chapter because they do far more work than any of the scanlators and theyre never so much as even mentioned anywhere on the Internet.Anyway aggregators generally do not take out the page that asks for support for the official release. this is because aggregators are trying to do AS LITTLE WORK as humanly possible so they copypaste the files probably without even looking through them.The reason I got into manga was because of scanlators yeah but if scanlators just put shit on their site without ever advertising it I would never find it. The reason I got into manga was because of aggregate sites. I would not be the manga fan I am today if it wasnt for onemanga.com and many of the people here will say the same. I almost want to say that every volume I bought and every dollar I gave to the industry is thanks to aggregate sites like onemanga.comBasically you are being a hypocrite. Thats all Im trying to say here.,manga,ctfjjs0,-13,t5_2ql0i

Because compared to Hana Chiyochan is basically meh but thats also a bit biased because of how little character development we get from her although thats on the authors part now.Anyway most of the manga or anime that have the first girl win compared to the other female character feels a bit justified because of how the MCs interact with each other going through more experiences together than any other character. Thats the dilemma right now though because Hana has had more experiences with Kiyoshi than Chiyo has ever had but we still chalk her up to win because of being the first girl despite having less experiences with the MC.,manga,cthp48f,5,t5_2ql0i

I raged so hard I wrote a complain to the publishers why they stopped translating it and selling the manga.I really liked the manga because it mixed seriousness and humour something like Gintama but with a diferent vibe.But as time passed the balance between development and gags broke and I started finding HNG! different in the meh direction. That and how Hatas art changed a LOT since the firsts volumes of the manga which although I think now is cleaner it has lost good aspects from the start.Maybe someday Ill reread it once again.

And he forgot the conversation too so the most we can accuse him is of gullibility. And frankly given that the true villain is clearly X Id say even Mooyoung is a victim.

It was considered a masculine name.  Off the top of my head I know there was a saint by the name of Lucifer of Cagliari.  Now as to it being another name for Satan that is a Christian construct that mostly came after the King James version of the bible came out.  In it Satan is named as the Morning Star numerous times and since the Latin term Lucifer is a literal translation of that the two became associated. The only time in the bible the Devil is actually named as Lucifer is in Isaiah .gt How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning!Even then he is only named that allegorically.

Realism ensues.One of the main reasons why I like the manga is because Kaname is such a cool protagonist.  He started off reacting realistically to the game but true to the title he adapts  he never really gets convenient shonen power ups or survive by luck.  Instead hes an intelligent hero who paves his own way through his problems and this chapter really showed that side of him.Spoilers the next arc is even better.,manga,cvovbss,17,t5_2ql0i

Also the publisher is not one of the big ones. It is printed Last Gasp so that is prob another reason it is rather unknown.Here is the link to the series,manga,cvpsxnw,3,t5_2ql0i
5305354,0,t1_cvptcyj,This manga is probably one of my favorite romances.

You may feel that other greater manga make it seem lame in comparison but that actually has nothing to do with the merit of BC and more on your preference of other titles. This thread is about shonen and what it means to be a good shonen manga and based on its adherence to the genre and its target audience Black Clover is a good shonen.

Anyways sorry for misunderstanding what you meantthough I still think youre just a bit off on that year prediction your comment made it seem you were calling Yen Press a rotten and despicable company just because they can take a while with their LN releases and their translation quality isnt always standardthough the same can also sometimes be said of fantranslations.,manga,cvv7kfs,0,t5_2ql0i

Casual readers and plenty of avid manga readers arent into cosplay dyed hair and wouldnt be seen dead in a Pokemon shirt. In my experience animemanga clubs Ive come across at schoolcollegeuniversity almost always only comprised of the most avid of fans. People who would otherwise join the club out a shared interest dont because theyre putoff by the more stereotypical passionate fans. Try to make it a casual thing with a casual atmosphere like a book club and not just a fangirlfanboyotakufujoshi circle where you talk pseudoJapanese and cosplay maids.

5479775,0,t1_cwc2fwt,In real life no one junior high school kid would be courageous enough to reveal those things he did then continue to live on with such strongwill knowing that he has done wrong and is atoning not even close to atoning for his sins by being ostracized. He lives day to day afterwards accepting that what is happening to him right now is what he deserves.spoiler I highly doubt any junior high school kid can have such awareness of his actions and accept his punishment day to day without crying or breaking down or just hiding himself at home. Instead our MC here goes on without a hitch. His thinking is so matured and rational for a junior high kid that he is able to forgive his crush for dating another guy when he was trying to destroy her a few weeks ago. I think anyone would still be salty afterwards maybe youre Nagaoka then its different.spoilerNot only that Takigawa would forgive him just like that. I think any girl that age whove experienced such trauma would have PTSD or something. Maybe even androphobia. Our Nagaoka is such an entity of positiveness he would continue to try and befriend our MC a few weeks or so after the revelation. In real life i think even if such a positive kid exists he would be too scared to approach Kurosawa again since he might get grouped together with onani master and made fun of.spoilerLastly Kitahara suddenly decides to get out of her room at the last minute to go to her junior high class reunion where all the memories of back then were just bullying and being left outinvisible. Sure would be a fun reunion. I think her being able to recover from that shutin state is actually possible but the story is too rushed and too positive to be believable enough. Try JUST talking to a shutin person to get them out of their house to confront meet their bullies again. I doubt youll be able to. Other thing is she stabbed her hand if i were in her shoes id stab the bully but thats still reasonable since im not Kitahara.spoilerP.S would you date a girl who tortured bullied your classmate whom youve personally and willingly took actions to violate her?spoilerAll in all i love this manga its a nice read. It tells a story where it could happen to anyone. People laughing at others in their own comfort zone while normally they wouldnt even look at the victim of the bullying.

At first I was thrown off because I thought that they jumped straight into the second chapter but after looking back at the manga this episode is the first chapter. I wonder if theyre going to somehow work in Chapter  into this animated serialization  or just keep on moving ahead.Also it was great that they didnt cut out any of the plot.

Yes the very definition of anime is animation made in Japan but nowadays the lines are thinning a bit. The west has opened its doors to anime and many other aspects of Japan. Now obviously things like Spongebob and Adventure Time were not made with anime in mind so theyd be filtered out but I dont see any reason for them to close the door on a series that would fit the bill and allow for meaningful discussion. ,manga,cx46qrt,4,t5_2ql0i

But the idea of students say Vitch to egg on their teacher because it sounds like Bitch seems like the kind of behavior youd get out of teenage students. Testing the teacher while not technically breaking rules.Viz of course also gets the authors input on the intent of the language used. They may or may not have in this particular case but its worth keeping that in mind rather than agreeing with an unofficial translators whims.,manga,cxno67l,11,t5_2ql0i

No one here wants to accept that as a reason so they try to justify themselves by taking a moral high ground and complaining that Mangastream is only fast with shitty quality. As far as im aware no one ever knocks off the small groups in here. If you want good quality with long waits then dont read Mangastream and wait for the group you support to put the chapter out. Instead they go into the discussion posts and post stupid passive aggressive remarks like Ill just wait till X group releases their scans Or post another thread in  days with another passive aggressive remark like Here is a much higher quality scan compared to MangastreamEdit spelling,manga,cxo1kii,8,t5_2ql0i

Mashimas route is to pick the character that knows more than the audience and have them LITERALLY VERBALLY EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. Its happened more than once too  just look at Tataros and the Magic Games arcs. Fairy tail unfortunately has become a hollow shell of what it once was. Probably somewhere around the Edolas arc is where it started getting bad. Mashima ran out of ideas and makes things up on the spot while heavily abusing deus ex machina.

The other SClass heroes tend to have reasons for being strong  PuriPuri Prisoner is huge Bang has ultraomgwtf martial arts Child Genius is well a child genius. The person who is most similar to Metal Bat is Tanktop Master but even he is pretty damn muscular.Furthermore Metal Bat also tends to have these aloof moments where he starts caring about his little sisters piano recitals during events that are likely to be important while Saitama cares about his grocery discount during a fight.At the same time this chapter shows that Metal Bat is basically the embodiment of a very common trope where willpowerfighting spirit conquers all.

Heres a cookie and a pat on the back. Now as for the content. Simple needs more. The analysis is...well lacking to say the least. I understand if you dont want to review every panel but at least give a more in depth review. It might be hard to do with shounen gaga but still. Try. The use of panels and pages to make your points was well done but it kind of brings me back to my other point. Your actual written content...you know the stuff thats supposed to be expressing your feelings and opinions on the material youre reviewing...pales in comparison. You have more images than complete paragraphs. Despite my complaints I still enjoyed the post. And Ill subscribe to your blog in hopes it gets better.

6173076,0,t3_4042n7,Shamelessly copy pasted my own comment from rShingekiNoKyojin .    So is The Beast Titans name Zeke or Sieg? Crunchyroll went with Zeke but the official french translation and the few japanese readers Ive seen talking about the chapter went with Sieg. You can link Sieg with Siegfried Sigurd of the Norse Mythology and you can link Zeke to Ezekiel the prophet. I think Sieg is the proper translation due to the numerous references to the Norse mythology in SnK. Also Sieg means Victory in german and thats quite badass.    Also this chapter is  flashbacks and Im not even mad. Lots of character development for the titan trio and more characterization for Sieg. Nice to see Isayama drawing so much Annie after so much time. The last time was  chapters ago! Marcos flashback was heartbreaking from all the point of views. Marco dying without understanding whats going on and betrayed by his comrades. Reiner forcing Annie to help them killing him then switching back to soldier mode. Poor Annie completely shaked by this unexpected event that makes me hate her a little less. And now its time for Bertolt to show what he is made of! Reiner isnt dead but unable to do fight right now he has reached a cockroachs level of immortality.    Marcos reaction at the beginning of the chapter probably will be met with mixed reactions by the readers. He literally repeated what Bertolt and Reiner just said before them. He probably was in denial when he heard them as if it was some kind of joke. The thought of them being the titans that killed half of humanity was probably ridiculous to him to the point of not realising what he heard and what he said.    Next chapter will be the last of volume . Expect something big    EDIT   Another proof that the beast titans name  is Sieg and not Zeke     Sieg Heil in japanese is   Source,manga,cyrbch5,59,t5_2ql0i

6208423,0,t1_cyuql8r,A major case involving Kaito Kid AND the BO has Kaito Kid aware that Conan is Shinichi and both of them casually talk about it which means the plot from the third anime movie from waay back discounting how Kid refers to Ran as Conans sweetheart got included to some degree in the mangas canon. Author does have a minor involvement in the movies like drawing some scenes but this was very unusual.Anime canon is weird. Back in the very beginning lots of references to the BO were cut they were probably intending to cut the show short to  episodes or so like Yaiba and so was the episode with Ai Haibaras older sister. The later filler episode aiming to repair this continuity error in order to properly introduce Ai had Conans face plastered on the front page of the next days newspaper as the little detective who solved the case of the bank robbery involving the sister of the scientist who made the APTX and helped the police find the money stash the Black Organization was supposed to fetch. Bonus points for the BO actually paying attention in that specific time frame more than ever as shown with further manga events to everything related to that case and people involved with lots of cleaning up.

6273775,0,t3_41h5bi,Seems like someone enjoyed The Kingkiller Chronicles too much. If thats not the case simply read it. There are two novels for now and thats the best fantasy story ever made. Yeah no less. Its about an old man but not so old who lives in a small village as a inkeeper and who tell his past to a guy. He appears to be the most reknowed and legendary magician ever. Just reading the back cover will make you read it and believe me its worth it. Kokou no Hito is not based on fantasy but is nevertheless really good. And theres also of course if you havent read it Tower Of God which fills more or less all the criteras you required.

6463077,0,t1_czn4xcf,I was actually thinking about Preston and Tiffany in I Shall Wear Midnight when I wrote it.  The ending in the story is actually pretty fun but when you realize that the novel essentially contains two epilogues one in which Tiffany sets everything right and another which just... is... you realize how yucky it all is.  Its interesting to me that Pratchett will often set up clear couples and then plunge one of them into milliontoone chances of living and you know what The Lady thinks about thatbeing together just before putting them together Thief of Time Men at Arms Mort The Truth but the circumstances in these examples are always created out of the conflict in the story and always result in a new status quo that brings the characters closer together.  I mean Angua took a bullet for Carrot.  Mort fought Death.  Lobsang unfreezes time and unites with his other half.  William confronts his father.spoiler  Side note that its interesting to me that so much of Discworld almost functions as a writers workshop on how to write a conventional story.

When shes first introduced Id think shell side with Souma one way or another but it turned out she easily sides with Azami. Also we still dont have more clue about her cooking style and background but its still piqued up my interest rather than new two dimensional villains.

I said she wields a complete ragnarok based off its looks and then elaborated that it would be a weaker version because it lacked the previous lords soul.gtYes he dodged that attack but if they were to fight for real you really think that Raskreia would be a challenge?We literally have confirmation in the comic that he NEEDED to dodge that last attack. That isnt the definition of not strong enough to face off against in my books.gtHe easily dispelled her blood fields while it took her great effort to do the same to his..She was holding back same as Rai.

At least Ive never seen any sign it has. When they take stuff from Norse Mythology its almost always on the level of having looked at a Norse mythology art book.

It feels real it IS real. When i read i can feel the passion of the artist on the pages. Most scans are worse quality or lose detail as well. About  Overpriced? How do you think its overpriced?  for about  usually more pages filled with epic story and drawings? You pay about  cents for  page. That is not overpriced at all.About  I have reread Bakuman  times Death Note  One Piece  Bleach  Kuroko no Basket  etc...No one can remember every detail of a series after a year or more. You only buy series you really like series that you can easily reread.About  And that matters why? Why would you sell your mangas?

Take this chapter for example did anybody find the idea that you could just roll a die to get the knowledge to score well on a calculus test objectionable?

GTOs The no personality teacher getting kidnapped by that loser teacher. Her little plot device I mean sister is introduced and she just happens to be into investigating and detective shows. She was never mentioned even once up to this point mind you. A bunch of garbage leads up to them catching the panty wearing loser teacher. What does that no personality stupid teacher do? She approaches the mentally ill man who kidnapped her dressed her in a bridal gown and asks for the gun. To which he replies by shooting Onizuka. Wow! At this point Im totally desensitized to him being shot. The teacher then takes the principal some students and the woman he kidnapped hostage with a bomb in the school. And all of this is rectified by having his brother say ten words and then the power of Onizukas friendship! Despite the evidence that this characters mental problems were deepseated and had existed for years.

6765444,0,t1_d0i0wl9,Mmm not too sure about the Erza thing. It was very early on and Im not sure if it could have played out as well as a death would now. It also seemed sort of like an introduction arc for Erzas character i.e. getting to know her backstory seeing her character more in depth having her develop etc.. FT sort of had a trend in the beginning where the major arcs sort of had a focus on a character and served as a way for the audience to get to know them better i.e. Galuna Island for Gray Phantom Lord for Lucy Tower of Heaven for Erza Laxus Arc for Laxus etc.. It sort of feels like a just getting started part of the series. Also I dont remember it super clearly since I saw it years ago but wasnt it obvious that it was a dream from the start?  Lisannas return was cheese but that didnt really bother me too much. What did bother me was how hilariously underused she was after he brought her back. He could have done so much with her character. She could have been used to give more depth to Natsu when you consider their past together. I always found that dark past side of Natsu to be interesting. I liked how talking about or mentioning Lisanna would suddenly turn a goofball like Natsu serious. I wanted Natsu to break down in tears when he discovered his Lisanna was alive haha.  If there were a large lack of consequences I think the more appropriate term would be underwhelming. From what I understand jarring is more like something sticking out or clashing. Constant happygolucky moments in a lighthearted series arent clashing.   I think the issue can be broader than consequences specifically. I think its important for characters to experience loss pain struggle and so forth. There doesnt necessarily have to be consequences in order to provide more conflict or meat to chew on sotospeak. Also if Im going to be technical here its not there are no consequences because there are its the fact that some of them can be dealt with relatively quickly.  In regards to the I know theyll be alright thing  thats sort of a given for almost anything though. I mean you wouldnt go into an Avengers movie and leave shocked at the fact that the Avengers made it out ok.  Like I wasnt worried when Infinite Tsukiyomi happened I wasnt worried for Luffy when he came facetoface with  Admirals etc. Even now Im not worried for my boi Sanji. We know the good guy will make it out ok . times out of  what matters is execution which of course Fairy Tail doesnt do so well at at times. Its like going back to what I said earlier the issue isnt specifically that the good guys make it out alive all the time necessarily what matters more is that the story gives you something to chew on. If somethings obviously a given then the story should at least give you something else to bite on. Its like One Punch Man even though you know the given conclusion of Saitamas fights proper execution can still give the audience a nice sense of awe and satisfaction and that satisfaction can range from a lot things.   And Ultears body isnt even real lol. Its some sort of ethereal form. And even if her body was real Id hardly call youthful appearances something that negates being stuck in a special gap in the fabric of time and space for possibly all eternity. Thats kinda like if we took Ryan Reynolds locked him into a timespace purgatory like Ultear but let him keep his chiseled sweet sexy Canadian body no homo.

6812881,0,t3_491qsq,I think youre conflating fanservice or smut with authorial explorations of sexuality or sex and sexuality as a plot device.  I would argue that within the context of manga or film the role of the former fanservice is to focus viewer attention while the role of the latter is to illustrate a larger point.  Ill provide two examples  Mars.  Wonderful wonderful wonderful Mars.  The sex depicted between the main characters in the series comes at a point where it demonstrates in an absolutely lovely tearinducing way how much they overcame and how much they trust each other.  Its beautifully drawn beautifully composed and indispensable within the plot.  Not like arousing though.  At all.  Different effect here.  Natsu no Zenjitsu and its prequel Mizu no Iro Gin no Tsuki both showcase Yoshida Motois ability to make points through sex.  And theres a fair bit of sex.  Itll dovetail with some of my latter points though in that its often not terribly appealing.  The sex within and the way characters display their bodies show us the way the characters feel towards one another.  NSFW  Check out the body position on this page and then compare it to this page three pages later.  The scenes wouldnt have anywhere near the impact they do except for Hanamis state of undress.    But that doesnt mean that a very good work of art cant be centered around sexuality.  Oshima Nagisas In the Realm of the Senses Love amp Pop directed by Evangelions Anno Hideaki and centering on the phenomenon of enjo kosai and Warm Water Under a Red Bridge featuring Yakusho Koji at his least accessible in a film about a romance centered on female ejaculation are all really interesting explorations of sexuality full of sex and nudity and food play and so forth.  All three films are very strong films that pose very interesting questions.  Theyre also not very much fun to watch.  And the sex depicted in all three is terribly unsexy and unarousing.  But indispensable to the film!    In western media I would argue that the nudity and sex in Stanley Kubrick and David Cronenbergs films are particularly indispensable.  Again not fun sexy times though.  In the case of the latter usually violent.  In rereading my post Im not sure that every point is as crisp and coherent as I would like but I really have to go else Ill be late for my nieces game!  Lemme know if the points arent coming across!

Like recently he indirectly called Trump not a Christian. But as people familiar with SpanishItalian pointed out while that is what he literally said the nuanced meaning was much more in the lines of not humane. It was a very general statement. But the literal translation led many in the English world to assume the Pope was questioning Trumps religious credentials.,manga,d0w70jk,7,t5_2ql0i

That price factored in my membership which is  if you dont have it but its worth getting if you plan on building a manga collection since Rightstuff is the best place Ive found to buy anything new. It says on the site that it may take a day or two to process a membership but mine went through the same night I bought it so... if I were in your shoes Id probably get it but theres no guarantee things would work out timingwise and their customer service isnt going to be able to answer any questions until tomorrow either.,manga,d1ft9ha,1,t5_2ql0i

7097868,0,t1_d1kw8hd,Ive had dozens of Japanese people both male and female come and go and probably only like one or two actually didnt mind manga. Its a pretty small population.They see people who like anime and manga just like how most Westerners see other Westerners who like anime and manga. You can probably see the correlation.From my experience most of the Japanese tenants arent good with their English in some fashion. It cant be helped.Most of them will learn better applying for and attending one of those private English schools for around  a month and most of them end up doing that. Thats the best advice you can give her since trying to teach Japanese people English yourself usually doesnt work out believe me Ive tried.If your girlfriend isnt desperate to learn English then casual conversation is more than enough and less pressuring on her. Let it gradually progress. If shes eager to learn anything English would please her.Just... dont give her anything Japanese or related to Japan. They came to Canada because of their interest in the Western world Canada. Not Japan. Try asking her what she would like to have. Shell tell you.,manga,d1kwwui,7,t5_2ql0i

Remember that after Kenpachi beat Unohana he started restricting himself in order to become weak enough to find decent fights. I think that at some point he needed to separate a part of his power out of his body in order to become weaker. Both Starrk and Kenpachi have stupidly high rietsu levels and split because of a need but Kenpachi didnt need company He needed to get weaker and separating a huge source of power inside him accomplished that.,manga,d1l0b70,2,t5_2ql0i

7206085,1,t3_4e4xec,Kingdom has terrible art and the mangaka is inept in captivating the reader. I say this having read  volumes. If you want to create an epic and long shonen battle manga you need to have a stronger cast of characters and maintain better narrative pacing. A historically set battle manga is right in my wheelhouse but there is somthing lacking in Kingdom which would take it from being merely  enjoyable to addictive. I think its the lack of verity in compelling characters. I think it even lacks emotional depth. I dont  know about you all but I didnt  give a rats ass about lot of the characters and wouldnt really care if some died.compare that to some of the deaths in Naruto  SPOILERS AHEADI really felt something when they killed off Jiraiya.

Hahaha no seriously since I didnt expect that guy to take race so seriously for someone whos essentially an ethnic japanese with the ability to stretch her neck I used the foreigner in China example because he was saying that they were treating her like a freak less than a human like a spectacle and like an exotic animal in a zoo and I wanted to get the point across that just because you see something you have never seen before thats not a disadvantage unlike their bullshit comparison to the handicapped in someone you can be amazed surprised even try to take pictures of such a rare ocassion for you and that doesnt mean at all that you are disrespecting them or even mean to disrespect. I used that example because its the closest real world example I could think of before the bodybuilder one but that doesnt mean I equated theyre exactly the same when the girl is essentially undistinguishable in every aspect from the average person except for her one ability which to others is a rare and amazing sight.I am very surprised though by your calling me out on the head pat thing. I honestly cant remember it exactly but head pat certainly rings a bell on somehing I found kinda sexist and made a comment about it and then mayyyyybe not sure I dont remember Ill take yor word for whatever you say happened I got into an argument over it with those who answered? I assure you my sentiment on this things isnt huge just like my first comment here unedited might show. Its just when people give me an argument I think is bullshit I do not back down. sides the fact that I can find something kinda sexist doesnt mean Im not gonna point out someone sounds like a true SJW for comparing this petty situation to real world race issues the freakin handicapped thinking of people like freaks or exotic animals.

7282624,0,t1_d25whsz,I was curious because you said people may be able to connect to it. But I think that should be only a small  of the readers. So Im still wondering why so many people would sent hate mails to Ishida Sui for this. The ratio doesnt fit. Also I know people who have been sexually abused as children and none of them show signs of public protest or anger they show signs of fear if anything. Theyd stop saying anything or stop expressing emotions when reminded of the traumas. In this case I dont think it has anything to do with personal experience. People just like to get upset on the internet without having any relations to it. They are just being presumptious.On a side note yeah the rape scenes in Wolf Goy  Ookami no monshou were quite disturbing but that added a certain flair to the story telling.

The last thing I am pretty sure of is that Mari has three personalities inside of her Fumiko being the original personality Mari surfacing due to her mother wanting to control her and her Komori personality manifested after stalking Komori for a long time when she was being Mari. I think I need to reread this after it is complete because when waiting for new chapters to come out I start to somewhat feel that this is dragging really unnecessarily.

7560659,0,t1_d31b9p3,Everyone hates on it but I actually find this manga refreshing and unique and wellwritten in some ways.  I like that hes not your stereotypical shounen MC who is more powerful than everyone else by his hard work or been granted great power by some outside force or powers up by friendship etc.  Hes a guy who got into the sport late has some natural talent but has kind of viewed things in an immature way which has held him back.  Hes growing and learning and failing at times along the way. Who knows how high he will finally reach but the story seems much more realistic and humanizing to what an amateur and hopeful pro fighter would probably go through which I find much more interesting.,manga,d31lzkx,6,t5_2ql0i

Its clear to see you absolutely hate the manga and its making you biased similar to how stitches bias shows with his love for Kimi no Iru MachI. Kimi no Iru Machi just isnt your cup of tea simple as that. Not to mention romance and drama almost always go hand in hand in any artistic piece of work. Take for example Romeo and Juliet one of the most famous pieces of romance literature and youll notice drama kills. Drama doesnt ruin romance its a part of romance. Its what makes romance. Saying the manga gives romance a bad name because there is little romance but a lot of drama is absolute bullshit to be honest. Youll even notice the manga community disliked the last few arcs of Kimi no Iru Machi because the author chose to focus on romance to end the show rather than add more drama. Romance that you so dearly love.,manga,d3g78ai,3,t5_2ql0i

7721094,0,t3_4l1xuz,The Dark Horse omnibuses are not all the same size. For example the Planetes omnibuses measure a reasonable . x . x . whereas the Astro Boy omnibuses are a measly . x  x .. A standard manga volume such as One Piece and the like measures about  x . x .. The middle number is of course the depth of the book making it shorter narrower and fatter than virtually every other manga on the market. Its annoying to hold open while having the book close enough to your face to take in the smaller details. But if you already know this and the paper quality is what youre concerned about its fine. Nothing to write home about but its not the horrible pulpy paper you see in some cheaper ins like One Piece or Fullmetal Alchemist. On top of that its also flipped to read from left to right. I wouldnt recommend it unless you havent read Astro Boy before and just want something readable which this is.

The translators used the colloquial meaning of marathon which is basically a relatively long running event that is technically shorter than a marathon and not competitive like a race.If you happen to have technical knowledge about running and running events maybe you think its stupid but the layman English world doesnt and uses marathon incorrectly all the time to the point that its totally normal. At least thats the case for American English which is the kind of English these translators are using. If theres an actual word for a shorter marathon that isnt competitive like a race Id love to know. Regardless I dont think that word would be appropriate here.

8050823,0,t1_d4kz5aq,AAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHEdit just for fungtIts one of those phrases a surprising number of people like apparently OP mistake. I wholeheartedly agree but allow me to play devils advocate here for a moment. For all intents and purposes I think you are making a big deal out of nothing. In an age where false morals are a dime a dozen true virtues are a blessing in disguise. We often put our false morality on a pedestal like a bunch of prima donnas but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granted. So I ask of you to muster up all the strength you can because it is a dogeatdog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge chip on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kitchen sink and even though you are having a field day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sixth sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky because I cannot turn a blind eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero tolerance when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what goes around comes around and when supply and demand fails you will be the first to go. Mark my words when you get down to brass tacks it doesnt take rocket science to kill two birds with one stone. Its clear who wears the pants in this relationship and sometimes you have to swallow your pride and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through trial and error but I swear on my mothers maiden name that when you put the pedal to the metal you will pass with flying colors like its a piece of cake.,manga,d4kzkva,9,t5_2ql0i

Its o look a land mass at sea our characters didnt know about is actually here. That happens literally every arc in one piece but it happens once in hxh and you think hats bad? A random island shows up outta no where. O ya zou Is actually a magical walking elephant. Punk hazard was on  maps but then poof ya go there and all the characters met there came out of no where. Also how is killing characters off bad? Its always been good. It adds tension and danger and creates some of the most memorable moments. I agree hisoka and chrollo are incredible villains however I would argue the king is even better. the pull between ant and human was some of the best character development I have seen. On top of that the fight between him and netero is probably the best shounen fight I have ever seen. Its riddled with metaphors and imagery and has incredible writing. Its not just throwing your biggest attack at whoever is around or watching two people throw a flurry of attacks at each other its more unique then that. If you truly believe the Chimera ant arc is the worst arc then it looks like you dont like deeper meaning and stuff that isnt standard shounen. It takes in a much darker genre and if your excluding based in that then I suppose I cant you seriously either.,manga,d4u4f4o,3,t5_2ql0i

They are simple and easy to digest observational humour pieces with just enough progress that they can create new scenarios to reflect on while not being specifically about the progress itself.I think people calling it like fast food are being a little harsh honestly it is in reality just a different approach. It is all good and well doing agonising serialisations with choppy pacing and indulgent tone shifts but containing workable ideas in just a few panels is really hard work especially after a few dozen chapters. Funnily enough I dont even really read the series though when they come up on my feed I will often read them for fun and enjoy them for what they are.

8366590,0,t1_d5nc2ou,You summarized it nicely. I always thought Kotaku and Gawker were shit for years and I wasnt surprised at all when so many issues started arising. It wasnt even political IMO just that gaming may due to its immature perception never had publications with true journalistic standards but lessthandesirable clickbait blogs and editors who let their leftist politics seep in their writing. Honestly seeing Gawker hurt was very satisfying considering how terrible they had been through the years.Then it became political and it all went to shit. Breitbart got involved. People like Yiannopolous and other assholes looking to leverage their influence at the expense of young undecided people showed up and took advantage of the whole situation. Being behind gamergate meant agreeing with these peoples politics and mostly conservative ideas. Then conservativism somehow became about freedom of expression and this plus many people from subs like TiA May rest in peace who couldnt distinguish satire allowed a strange black and white perception that if you didnt agree with everything these influencers said you were an evil SJW who wanted to kill white men  this in turn created hordes of people who now see everything outside the Trump worldview as a conspiracy by some sort of liberal media that wants to see them dead... and now you have a new generation of reactionaries and altrighters illustrating some of the worst things in humanity.Of course most of us abandoned ship when we realized how one sided the whole thing was becoming and how very obviously some people were only using it for political gain. And thankfully I dont support Trump or shitpost on TheDonald but I cant say I didnt enjoy it deeply every time I saw Gawker do their terrible damage control and alienating its own readers.Edit for grammer.,manga,d5ndici,22,t5_2ql0i

If anything I would really like the new entrants to be diverse.One standard action adventure set in a medieval fantasy world. Too many of these in the last few years have been lacklustre.

Yeah its pretty annoying that the story about Raku and Chitoge developing romance the one weve been waiting to see come about for years was immediately cut short for something that feels so tacked on. So again it depends on how the next chapter handles it to really see how this chapter which kind of annoyed me as it is now works in context with the ending. ,manga,d5uj7dh,14,t5_2ql0i

She has the kind of feelings for him that could make a man who has died several painful agonizing downright sadistic deaths feel like life is worth living again.And he turned her down for someone he lets face it barely knows. And I know its fictional but I just feel like... if someone ever felt that deeply for me so deeply I could even learn to like myself I think I could devote my life to making myself deserving of that love. To not only shoot her down but ask her to help him get with another girl... and for her to love him so much that she actually agrees...I just still cant believe someone could be offered so much and just... fuck it I dont know what Im saying anymore.

8641600,0,t1_d6lphgn,Depictions of sex nudity and objectification can be really multifaceted but the depth of the representation in comics depends on which ones youre reading.Like the uncanny valley theres probably an uncomfty valley that exists for depictions with a certain degree of closeness to things that would feel violating of social normstaboos. Though one may be able to recognize that the image may not necessarily cause any harm on its own or have been created through real abuse what it represents and all of the circumstances behind its creation is way more complex than that. Thats also compounded with how close to a realistic style or perhaps pervasive it may be how commonpopular the depictions might be in the style to be associated with its representation and in this particular case the fact that the media is created in a foreign social space. The intricacies of how one viewsconsumes a particular piece of media as a single object or as a larger representation may be up to individual prerogative but you cant separate it from largerthanindividual issues either. Is it a problem that you have a problem with these depictions you feel like are less okay? Media exists that address challenging issues and get you to question social norms that are actually damaging and exploitative but youre probably not going to find it in the works you mentioned.,manga,d6lt5mn,1,t5_2ql0i
8642827,0,t1_d6lryag,The animation is not just awful. Its lazy. Ill give an example  Fujitora fighting Doflamingos minions at a bar in his first appearance. Instead of actually animating a fight scene with his arms and legs moving they move Fujitora across the screen like a cardboard cutout and make slashing sounds. Look at the more recent fights like Law vs. Vergo and Zoro vs. Pica. Same thing. The animators cut corners like crazy.Regarding stretched out plotlines One Piece has lately been converting one chapters material into one episode or more regardless of content which means the plot moves as slow as molasses.,manga,d6lyp63,8,t5_2ql0i

I know you cant check this but you need to remember that Fanbases are different. For someone like you who reads both this can be extremely frustrating so definitely get where youre coming from with this. . With that said I dont doubt there are people out there who are blind followers of one piece. I mean theres a subreddit dedicated to it because the people over at ronepiece dont want it to become a hell hole of circle jerking but I think those who are of that kind are very few. .

8767926,0,t1_d71h0x2,Its dependent on the medium. The NGC had limitations so the manga will have more detail I suppose.Enter a mini review of the style from my perspectiveHowever at a glance I cant say I like the stylized version of the games art. One of the anchors of the game was that the characters were distinctly not realistic in their design and this includes the mobrandom NPC characters. In the manga the side characters can look realistic and its completely out of character with the game.TPs major draw for me at least was how somber it was. It wasnt gruesome but it was kind of cold and had like an overcast over it almost all the time. Its what made it so enveloping. I dont find this enough in this manga.,manga,d71nkgn,1,t5_2ql0i

8799644,0,t1_d74rdki,Depends on how motivated you are. Plenty have done it. Plenty have also failed. JP at my school usually had around  students by th semester it was . But we also didnt offer a major in the lang only a minor Ancillary benefit for me was using it on vacation over there and possibly getting a job where they might need to send me on a business trip or talk to business partners over there. Proficiency in any foreign lang. looks good on a resume. Shows dedication etc. Also having an appreciation for other parts of their culture certainly helps for motivation of course.Good news is there are a lot more resources around today than ever before. Of course you have books to start like the Genki series ones. But Anki flashcards app is great for studying vocab and kanjithere are decks separated by grade level or by JLPT level There are  levels of JLPT test for proficiencyRikaichan is a nice translation addon for text for Firefox and one called KanjiTomo is OCR that works for manga or even light novel ebooks. So even if your kanji knowledge is relatively weak those two tools let you read stuff way earlier than you might imagine as long as your grammar is solid.There are language exchanges sites out there where you can find Japanese people looking to practice English and you help each other out. Tune into Japanese TV streams and get a feel for its use in everyday speech etc.IMHO stuff like anime and manga cant be learned from as a single source but combined with actual class or book learning they can carefully be a supplement that allows you to hear how to fluently speak and pick up some vocab here or there. You just have to be careful bc theyre often speaking casual or rude or maybe very masculine or feminine speechunless you want to make your teacher laugh at an adult speaking like a yo girl or something ,manga,d75likb,1,t5_2ql0i

8877123,0,t3_51tk4k,I saw it more as a playful or tongue in cheek lampooning of WSJ tropes and patterns but I feel that despite often being quite clever about how it approached things that it is also somewhat hypocritical it purports to be aware of the trappings of shounen battle manga tropes but frequently feels specifically as if it indulges in or falls back on them because it doesnt know what else to do. I also think that the manga makes more sense if you consider it a manga about a side character from another manga. Though it frequently suggests Medaka is the main character of the story the reality is that thematically and mechanically it just isnt ever close to true from the start it is Zenkichi. While if we consider her the main it makes it interesting in the sense that he wrestles the lead position from her that still makes him the archetypal hero. I always figured that was somewhat the point but I dont know if that is quite as clever as the series likes to think it is. I am inclined to think the story was initially going to be a lot less crazy so there is good potential the clumsy setup is a side effect of that.So yeah it is clever and self aware but to me it is closer to a Lampoon. Films like Hot Shots and Loaded Weapon make fun of cliches and use absurdist humour in their parody but ultimately mechanically they are standard action films at their core or rather they tend to follow the basic beats of the films they are parodying. That is what I see Medaka Box as a series that was making fun of WSJ battle mangas while doing all the same things. ,manga,d7ewlbg,6,t5_2ql0i

More in between the missions and more characters thats actually worth caring the slightest about. Personal preference wouldve been if the MC had been slightly more of an asshole that abused his powers.

8943841,0,t1_d7mvr74,Complex by Manda Ringo is phenomenal. Its the story of two boys and we follow them from when theyre in elementary school to when theyre elderly. Its a rollercoaster of feels and the relationship feels very genuine with its ups and downs. This is actually one of my top manga of all the time. WARNING the first chapter contains shotacon but its literally nothing like what the rest of the series is like. Honestly even if you skipped it you wouldnt really miss anything.Hidamari Ga Kikoeru is a very heartwarming story between a deaf guy and a guy who actually understands his disability and tries his hardest to help. Makes you feel fuzzy inside.Seven Days is another happy SOL romance. Its short and lighthearted with very good art.And finally this one doesnt really have romance but it portrays the struggle of a feminine gay guy out in the boonies Smells Like Green SpiritIm assuming you already know about Old Xians  Days webtoon which is basically the boy version of Their Story.

9105017,0,t1_d864pzo,This is mostly the right answer.  Id like to clarify a few things though.  For more time is required for logistics work acquisition of assets and permissions printing shipping advertising promotions etc. than is required for actual work on any given manga. Even though an official release may seem to take an interminable amount of time a given fan translator may actually be able to spend far far FAR more time perfecting a translation or typeset than is available to a professional translator or designer who will have tight deadlines dictated by A the publisher but also B their own economic imperatives.  Given that you have to be able to main a pace of X words per Y days in order to maintain your livelihood.  Regarding translation specifically its also important to remember that the folks working in manga translation generally arent the sharpest knives in the tool shed.  Manga translation cant pay the way medical legal or etc. translation can which in turn demands far more technical acumen and precision.  And it generally doesnt allow the artistic freedom that working on a novel translation does.  The bar in terms of professionalism and expertise that were talking about in terms of the average professional manga translation is far far higher than the average fan scan level be it Mangastream Kirei Cake or others but perhaps quite a bit lower than what you see in the best of the best.   Id also add that unless theyre using legacy assets graphic designers probably wont need to redraw much of anything.  Acquiring visual assets with intact layers means not having to redraw nearly as much text if any.  But youre mostly right I think.  ,manga,d869zai,9,t5_2ql0i

9142479,0,t1_d8ai913,Eh I had a similar thought experiment about Bleach which I did end up reading to the very end.  However there are substantial differences between this and Bleach for me.  In this last arc of Bleach the chapters were usually still entertaining and enjoyable standalone.  Additionally I was genuinely interested in seeing the actionscombat of many of the characters in Bleach in that last arc.  Neither of those criteria are met for me with Girls of the Wilds Many of the chapters are just outright frustrating to read and Ive become apathetic about practically the whole cast.Sure its only five minutes a week but that adds up over time.  Sometimes its easier to just write off a series as a failure and move on than to stick it out and keep being disappointedfrustrated every week.,manga,d8avi5q,3,t5_2ql0i

A lot of manga fans seem really against colour because it isnt authentic enough as well which is a genuine shame.I spoke to some friends about the series and the general consensus was that post season one the series often felt like it dragged a little. It also borrows some of the more tedious manga battle shounen tropes like inexplicable power ups a jack of all trades main slightly inconsistent characterisation etc. I dont think any of that should be a dealbreaker but I can see why some people might find it a little tiring as a series as a result. ,manga,d8cw7uz,2,t5_2ql0i

Case in point how he used the treasurer. It was such a tiny little bit but man was it glorious. Not only were we shown a new light of him as he was able to quickly take control of the situation and come up with improvements to that budget Kaguya instantly recognized his skills and admitted defeat just like that. She knows that she doesnt compare to him when it comes to being a treasurer. To me was really interesting. He looked pretty cool here and manage to not come out as a fool even if the little sister didnt saw him favorably he could have given a way worse impression but now we know that Kaguya recognizes him. Hes not just an insect hes a godlike treasurer! And its even better because so far weve been only told that he is good never shown. Its like Star Wars Episode II at the beginning on an elevator Anakin and ObiWan alude to past adventures and how friends they are with each other but we never saw that. Seeing is important!

I have to preface it by saying the first translation is by no means incorrect. But the reason the second translation is better is first it makes it clear the subject in question is the person who said character is speaking to and second Ive never heard anyone ever say something like the first translation. Or another example Why do you want to end it? versus Why do you want to break up?. The first translation isnt wrong and sure you have images to make it clear for the illiterate but which would you say?We want to improve the quality that is being put out and by no means are we saying were perfect but I am and any suggestions for improvement are welcome.

9803226,0,t1_dalfzzp,Ill give a general overview with minor overall spoilers but nothing specific and try to be as unbiased as possible.minor general spoilerss Its a surreal manga that follows a child as he grows to adulthood as his life spirals further and further into misery and he himself spirals further and further into depression and borderline insanity. All the while every glimmer of hope that is presented for him to escape this vicious cycle is either squandered by the protagonist himself or the universe conspires to prevent his life from improving. It also has some VERY darkmature themes.Its very surreal the main character and his family are all drawn as dimensional birds for starters and does an exceptional job of conveying the protagonists mental state to the reader and evoking a whole host of negative emotions. I as a reader drew found no enjoyment in the work nor did I walk away from it feeling that Id learned or gained a new appreciation for anything. Judging from the rest of the sub my opinion of Punpun is in the minority so Im not gonna tell you that it has no value and should be unconditionally avoided.

MCs goal is concrete and has a semblance of a plan which I find is very rare in comparable shounen mangas. This definitely helps in tying plot points up.

10283444,0,t1_dc9jli9,My main issue with it I think is how a lot of the arcs failed to live up to their potential. Tournament arc Midoriya fight vs Shinsou was so disappointing. He literally went out of character and gave up to Shinsous powers just so One for All can pull a deus ex machina and save him. It was too obvious especially since he was forewarned of Shinsous powers. Then that remedial lessons was the same with Midoriya using an ass pull to beat a oneoff villian who just happens to be the one that hurt that Kouta kids parents. Then the Bakugou rescue arc that whole rescue Bakugou with the Tetsu kid as the one to reach out to his hand was just weird for me especially considering that was supposed to be a climax moment. Needless to say I was even more disappointed that Midoriya didnt get to fight Shiragaki even once by that point.Most recently the hero license arc again had Midoriya hold a reserved role instead putting highlight on Todoroki and the wind powered boy. Whats more the license arc only lasted two rounds so the tension between wind boy and Todoroki was over just as quickly as it began.I honestly think these arcs could have been much better if they were better planned and lasted longer with more characterization given to Midoriya and the villains. I see Midoriya is the intelligent leader type but he gets pushed to the background quite a bit to highlight other supporting cast. Aside from the first few chapters he hasnt been as stand out as I would have liked from a MC and thats partly due to quite a few of his fights end up being utterly terrible.,manga,dc9ony3,1,t5_2ql0i

10284212,0,t3_5n7vfx,Loved the protag. Sort of refreshing to see a protag that wasnt all about his friends and friendship. Sure he did fight for his friends but that was because they were in danger a lot. I also like his passivity and the idea of his that Yeah I beat you but your beef still isnt resolved so lets try to fix that. For many of the starting fights at least. I think after ch it sort of stopped but it was fun while it lasted.I like the romance that was there between Anna and Yoh because no one gave a shit about it! It was just yeah shes my wife. We care about each other but thats about it. Lets keep going with the plot. Seriously it was just nice to have a romance that didnt feel like we had to play the Will they or Wont they game! Sure it wasnt a focus or have much devoted to it but it was nice to have a romance that was just cute at times. The fights were fun and well thought out at times but it did get a bit long winded at time with some of the fights and character upgrades. The character sort of made sense with the upgrades Horohoro will continue to confuse the crap out of me but whatever. I both dislike and love the idea of death making a shaman stronger. I understand that takes the stakes out of death but at least they established that they had a limited  of times they could do it.

The second big reason is that places like Batoto have banned the series from their sites if it was just some hseries I wouldnt care but there is real literary merit here more so than most random manga anyhow.  While it can certainly be overrated I really dont mind it being overrated because its still decent and more importantly its a giant FUCK YOU to the Batoto staff who banned it.  ,manga,dca5vn9,1,t5_2ql0i

10517259,0,t3_5qijrk,Final Arc of Naruto. Their is just so much no in it. From having the main badguy being so invencible that a new character has to be introduced. And that new character being a goddess who apparently gave everyone their powers that also means the previous big bad was more powerfull than a godess.Having our MC whos whole backstory was about being a street rat and raising up from nothing heck that was his whole speech to Neji. But then as soon as we learn his dad is hokage that goes down the drain ending up being the decedent of ninja jesusbuddah and a literal moon goddess. Having not one not two but three genocidal mass murderous go loose and no one seeming to care. I mean heck they even accept the kid of the  guy who basically started all of that shit onto a team with their kids.In stead of having the Antihero character or real MC with as much screen time and powerups he got redeem himself though noble sacrifice or be punished at all he just gets in a fight with the MC and then is allowed to walk the world seeking redemption. this last one is way more questionable and is a shipping things but im counting it the MC instead of getting the girl he was in love with who he had shared adventures with and who had grown from her first apperances ends up with a girl that has hardly ever spoken to him and has maybe ten whole chapters to her name if you added all the scenes she was in together. ,manga,dd08t85,18,t5_2ql0i

10538615,0,t3_5qvant,Its an easy and cheap way to make MC look good. You create a very obvious moral dilema meaning its a fake dilema in which all of the audience will take the same side as the MC against the evil slavers having our MC take the moral higher ground without doing anything really special since in the society were we come from that is a basic statement. Its like having a character that wants to fight for justice and wants to vanquish evil its impossible to be against that and gives him quick and simple characterisation even if its incredibly flat and not really brave or thought provoking from the authors part.Its also one of the worst things humans can do so it creates a quick shock and shows how awful the world is and how bright and great an MC with a generic personality and set of morals is.,manga,dd2o38i,9,t5_2ql0i

And not only that one of them even disappeared off Syosetu.com Altho sometimes that happens because they got licensed but I havent seen heads or tails of it from an actual company since thenOne of them had a brothersister go through an eerie gate at the end of a dungeon in a VRMMO game and wake up back in the bottom of the dungeon with the minotaur boss respawned. Except everything was real at that point and they had only a small bag of supplies so the first part of the story is them trying to survive their way out of the minotaurs maze in pitch darkness except for a torch for over a week. Sister takes almost mortal wounds fighting the minotaur at first because they didnt realize the fight was for realOther one was similarly VRMMO turned real except the world was slightly different and dealing with the real consequences of adventurer magics being stupidly powerful compared to what the average people could use. IE Cant go carelessly lobbing off fireballs in a forest or youll set fire to everything and kill yourself from the firestormsmoke inhalation. Earthquake fucks up the ground in the area etc. MP drain can make you pass out etc.Unfortunately that second one I forgot to bookmark while reading partway and I havent been able to find it again because as you said there are just so many isekai stories lol.,manga,dd3fo7y,2,t5_2ql0i

They arent operating from a position of honest fan interest its just a way for them to make money from ads hence why they do the entire Top of manga even when picking it up years late because the series grew in popularity and was already being scanlated quickly and competently.Their Alexa site ranking is higher than Funimation.com and theyre about equal to MangaHere. For a site that is one scanlation group... That is millions of hits per month.They do a halfassed shit job and undercut the street date of the magazine going on sale even.The problem is your average manga reader are pleb teens with no impulse control so they gobble up their awful releases even when they might only have to wait hours or a day for a better release.

10771565,0,t3_5u2a11,Its easily FMA.HxH is an incoherent mess. My opinion is that I dont like it.  And for anyone who takes issue with me not liking it please let me try to explain myself so that you may understand some of my issues with it even if you dont necessarily agree..  The dialogue and lessons seem to be inconsequential.  For example somewhere early in the story during the Hunter exam a test was about saving your GF vs your mother.  And somehow the answer was to not answer and this situation had no underlying plot at all.  The main character even mentions how the only reason he didnt respond was because he couldnt choose.  Why does this need to be included?  There are other examples but its been literally years since my last reread of HxH..  There are too many unknowns.  For example we dont even know what Hunters even do or why they have a license to kill.  Furthermore they can sell these badges and all the rights that go along with it.  Why is the only requirement of the Hunter test strength?  Is their society not afraid of people who will abuse the powers that come along with the badge?  What kind of things happened for things to be this way?  What responsibilities do they have in exchange for such power? Let me remind you that the title is HunterXHunter and we hardly know what they do or why they exist..  Abilities are kind of bullshit.  Im mainly focusing on the fact that you can limit your abilities and be outstanding VS. a very limited population.  Its just not a good mechanic in a fighting manga.  I guess this one is an opinion but obtaining a cheat like power by limiting yourself feels really shitty to me.  It would be okay if this mechanic added to the story but its just kinda there.On my first read through of HxH I was extremely surprised by how much I didnt like it.  I liked what the author did with the villain of the chimera ant arc but the pacing was so slow it was a burden to read through some chapters.  Surprised by how much I didnt like it in contrast with the views of buddies in real life and this subreddit I had a second read through.  My opinion has only gotten worse.  I cant remember all the issues I have with it given that its been years but reason  plays a huge part in my dislike of the series as a whole.,manga,ddr0a1g,3,t5_2ql0i

The girl literally only exists as a plot devicedamsel in distress for the guy to activate his powers so he can save her from her ohsoterrible fate. It was hilarious how the bad guy just pulled out a gun and shot the MC while the girl didnt care at all apparently. I think I saw someone else say it but its like this manga trying to be a parody by making authorityconservative views evil but its actually taking itself seriously. I will say that the art is pretty good.Also they try too hard to make the adults hateful and evil so youre pretty much forced to be on the high schoolers side. I like mangas better that dont really have a clear division between good and evil like theres evil characters but you can understand their motives and possibly sympathize with them. Or if theres an evil faction not all of them are terrible and evil unlike in U. But maybe theyll put in some sympathetic adults in the future.,manga,ddzo3j3,20,t5_2ql0i

10896106,0,t1_de3ulfm,Ehhh... ish. Also not really?  I dont want to actually say anything about Sad Girl except that you should read it.  Hard for me to say anything about it without giving it away.I translated a few chapters of Kujira no Kora two years ago. Stalled as a collaborator exited and the redraws for the series require talent and attention to detail that I do not possess. Not that  itself is an especially difficult translation and you can see I translated it straightforwardly but I notice that ANN used Mud Whale and Im curious as to how much of the less straightforward terminology if any will dovetail with what I utilized.  Well see.  I think Rakugos quality stands out far more in the anime space dominated as it is by adaptations of tripe aimed at middle schoolers on the one hand and otaku on the other than it does in the manga space where I find it distinctly less remarkable. I really do believe its topic of rakugo is a big boon as Japanese cultural scholars especially seem to have fervent love for its dying or nearly dead cultural mediums.    I think your point about Kamuy is a good one.  Like Rakugo its been nominated before.  I wouldnt give you long odds on Kamuy either.  Sad Girl and Kujira IMO have far longer odds despite my fervent admiration for both. ,manga,de3utwe,1,t5_2ql0i

10940172,0,t1_de8d8nj,Yeah I think a big part of it is that the magic system and power fantasy aspect is just easy to grasp for anyone reading appealing to the lowest common denominator and all that. Its probably a big reason of why they do so well in spite of shoddy writing because the leisurely escapism you speak of doesnt exactly require the next Shakespeare writing it to be entertaining. I understand that there are a number of good parodies running around. The problem for me personally that they are still just parodies in that none of them are seriously trying to make a good serious story but are rather just making fun of the ones who do. There is nothing wrong with thatI quite enjoy them after all but I still think it would be nice to see more people give a more innovative and serious take on this now saturated genre.I will note that of all the Isekai I have seen Youjo Senki stands out in that it has a differentif not terribly fleshed out magic system and is actually in a different world that isnt Dragon Quest .Alternate universe WW.  Even with an overpowered MC it still gives me hope that more Japanese LN writers are willing to take risks like that and construct a truly original Isekai. ,manga,de8eh5g,2,t5_2ql0i

Even if the scifi manga had half as many votes as the manga in the ninth position I would still say the manga in position nine has a greater chance of getting cancelled than the scifi manga in last. This is because they target different demographics and while more people may like manga number nine they are running eight other similar series so jump would be unlikely to lose readers however if they cancelled the scifi manga its very likely they would lose a number of subscribersYou know you may be right about that ,manga,dewqcgi,2,t5_2ql0i

11230258,0,t1_df4iynr,The quality of the writing doesnt factor in here. Its not a harem if the attractive people are interested in OTHER people. Take to love ru for instance. Theres a male classmate character in that series. Hes surrounded by beautiful girls. All of them are interested in some other guy. If theres a spinoff story based on his life it wouldnt be a harem. What about one of the girls? What about Lala? Shes surrounded by beautiful girls theyre all interested in her and want to be her friend. Its not a harem for her because none of them has any kind of romantic inclination for her. Take any American soap romantic drama series. Take gossip girl. Cast is filled with attractive people. Lots of people are interested in each other romantically or not. We dont have any significant period where we have more than  people attracted to the same person. No one would ever call it a harem. The only one that really tried to romantically pursue Tohru was Kyou. Yuki later clarified that he never romantically loved her and went off chasing some other girl. Momiji didnt even become a romantic interest until Yuki was already out of the picture and he basically only tried to be her friend. All the rest of the guys were paired off with other women some of them are already in long term relationships by the time they were introduced. You source mangaupdates? A website where anyone can edit the tags? Ok. I source wikipedia. Harems have to be ROMANTIC. On the other hand Id accept Ouran as harem.

Punpun had slow believable character development throughout but the ending section drops all of this PPs in trade for making Ayako and Punpun flat out insane. I could not find any of Punpuns actions after he killed Ayaokos mom beliavable. For instance  the stab me in the eye part or Punpuns immediate reaction of Do it right bitch where he just suddenly got a lot meaner for no fucking reason. I guess what Im saying is that the end was a huge drop in quality due to rushed and poorly thought out character development.  ,manga,dfkeyw3,2,t5_2ql0i

There are only ever two love interests and one flies out of the window in the first few chapters and focuses more on maturity than love.Youre free to your tastes but I think its received fairly. It has a strong narrative that doesnt stall or waiver each character has distinctive personality traits and are allowed an absolute tonne of progression meanwhile the best aspect of the manga arguably is the nonbinary way in which its written. Like youve mentioned bad guys arent all evil and good guys arent all heroes. You end up uturning over your opinion of characters every few chapters which is a sign of superb writing.Its great.

The title has been explicitly referenced in the series as least twice  its established that Hayates parents named him as such so that he would be fast like the wind so he could outrun debt collectors and the like and its also the name of the technique Hayate spends a portion of the early series trying to acquire Finally using it to defeat Majin Yukiji in the Tigers Den for Butlers... and then only using it one other time and being completely ignored afterwardsThe implication is that the quoted text is the wish Yukariko made on the royal power and is meant to explain Hayates seemingly impossible ability to rescue Nagi from any situation  including the bonus chapter where he traveled back in time to protect a younger Nagi from the mafia in Mykonos... which incidentally is the same incident that led to that nun to swear vengeance on him.This is a weird series.

11721503,0,t3_678zx0,I believe what we are noticing is not so much a drought of good manga but a surplus of lower quality content being created. I dont know the market as well as Id like but I assume it plays a lot to how entertainment is being created these days in general. Consumers want junk food all the time and its easy to create. A web novel gets popular because its a cheap but still entertaining read and it goes on to get an equally cheap but still entertaining manga. Readers might not find this content the most satisfying but they enjoy the constant snacking in this busy world of ours.Im also assuming that the market is more welcoming to new creators these days. The tools have advanced and publishers seem to be more accepting in hopes of finding a diamond in the rough or just a popular fluke. This does create a bandwagon environment like with how prevalent reincarnation stories are but competition is also good. Now if there were NO decent manga being made right now Id agree that there was a problem. But there are so many wonderful and deeply artistic stories being written. So long as those works are being championed for the art pieces they are... I dont think we have anything to worry about. ,manga,dgonuwz,2,t5_2ql0i

Shit like this is why we really need a mangaaccurate anime remake.As far as the differences between this newest Yen rerelease and the original Tokyopop one from what Ive observed the translation is actually a little worse! Not too bad just a little too literal for my tastes though Ive found they did some lines better than the original too so each translation has their own pros and cons. ,manga,dgqtgv3,1,t5_2ql0i
