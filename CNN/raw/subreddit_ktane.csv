Say Break when you think you see a break in a letterSomething like  Dot dot break dash break dot dash dash break I dont know if this spells anything,ktane,cvutpv0,3,t5_3a9bc

5375951,0,t1_cvytss1, I wasnt planning on shooting any content at PAX South....but Id never say never I suppose shooting on iPhones is AOK these days right?.  I was at PAX South last year and I brought an awesome game called Johann Sebastian Joust.  Someone randomly came by and filmed us playing which you can see at  I had the game for a while before the embargo so I played it a lot but anyone I wanted to show that wasnt playing with me facetoface had to wait which of course is not terrible for a game like this but youre still curious what the damn bomb looks like.  I wasnt planning on anything getting big though I did start streaming as soon as the embargo lifted because someone wanted to see the game spirit I think?  I dont remember exactly.  The video that ended up going viral was just from one of my streams and I thought it was a cool video to share with some other friends because this game is just as fun to watch as it is to play.  I dont really have an embargo on indie games or video games in general but I kind of get it from the point of view that you dont want to have all the momentum burn out before release. Yup Ive been writing software professionally for  years now.  Ive toyed with the idea of becoming a game developer but I just dont think Im that creative of a person...or at least Im not great at coming up with ideas.  Sometimes I get sparks of inspiration to work on things but thats not enough to start a game company . Yeah I play Dota .  My favorite player is BigDaddyNtail and my favorite team is monkey business.  Though I was watching NiP v. A today and holy crap what a great series. Im about to leave work so I will draw you one of those and my favorite Dota hero when I get back home. absolutely never. Just like I will never stop my finger from slipping on Simon Says. ,ktane,cvyu7an,1,t5_3a9bc
