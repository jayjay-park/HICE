8408911,0,t1_d5slo70,Yes that would be awesome and I would love to see if a deeper smoke is possible! As a person who spends hours in a practice server throwing nades I really find this to be an incredible find. Ill be looking out for more stuff like this from you!,CSGO_NadeTactics,d5snqn1,2,t5_31jz0
