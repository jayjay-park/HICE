Also at that level you should go with a B H MSI board so you can overclock the CPU because that motherboard is wasting a lot of money if youre going with a low or medium end card.Or just message me and Ill get back to you in like ten hours.

2752091,0,t3_2rjyqj,build looks great you might even consider dialing back your GPU if you want to save a bit of money. An  series card would be more than enough to run your current library and run new games for  years at least,KillYourConsole,cngwgm2,1,t5_307dc

4010302,0,t1_crdcatk,A custom cooler would be more efficient but would require a large amount of space. Heat dissipation should be even if airflow is poor as long as you arent maxing both the CPU and GPU all the time. If you consciously think about how the air is flowing throughout the case and put fans in properly with maybe an extra case fan you will be fine.You might want to use a tool and make sure that the spare hard drive is in good working order and wont kill you data. Keep in mind the total  GB is very tiny. I would personally recommend at least  TB with the size trend of recent games. ,KillYourConsole,crdelio,1,t5_307dc

6186827,0,t3_408js2,As has already been said you might be able to upgrade but youll need to do some digging to find out your processor model and socket first.  Plus a GPU would be a better upgrade.That said... Based on Dells website Im not sure either are possible. The s comes with a proprietary CPU cooler cant see if its user removable and you dont sound like the techiest person so Im not going to suggest modding and a w PSU  even a ti would need more than that to be safe considering the wattage of other components. Unfortunately this thread suggests the PSU size is also proprietary so youd have to contact Dell.I think you need to do some serious research before making any purchases above and beyond what this sub can suggest.,KillYourConsole,cysvlnk,2,t5_307dc

6677515,0,t3_470zjn,You can buy discs or USB copies of Windows here The cheap OEM copies will work just fine for you.  The idea behind those is theyre supposed to be sold to companies making and selling PCs like Dell.  Thankfully we plebs can get our hands on these copies now.You can also buy downloadable copies for use in the USB install here There are of course other methods of acquiring Windows but Ill leave that up to you.Once you pop in the flash drive youll need to tell your computer to boot from the flash drive instead of hard drive.  Usually this entails hitting F again and again while the PC is starting up until a boot selection menu appears.  The key may be different on other systems.Once youre in the Windows installer itll pretty much walk you through it all.  Just pick your hard drive to install on then answer some questions and enter your windows key code or whatever.Once youre done with the OS and on your new desktop fire up a browser get a better browser Chrome Firefox etc then go get video card drivers and all the latest drivers for your mother board.  Find out what your motherboard is called and google its namenumber plus download. I.E. ASRock HM Pro download  You should find the manufacturers website with a whole list of stuff you probably dont need.  What youll want from them is audio drivers chipsetINF drivers and maybe storage drivers and LAN drivers.  You probably dont even need anything other than the sound driver honestly.  I like to go nuts though.After youve downloaded and installed all those drivers you should be pretty much good to go.  Windows will probably have a whole lot of updating to do so make sure you leave it on overnight or something and restart when it asks to.  You dont have to wait for Windows while you do all the drivers though.,KillYourConsole,d0a0hkv,1,t5_307dc
