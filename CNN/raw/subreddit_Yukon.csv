Time in the game does not stop as you live though the events developing our own story. In the village everyone has an opinion of you and your choices influence the game.

Weve got a nice ski hill a good rec center and tons of trails for hiking biking ATVing crosscountry skiing and what have you. Some people find its a bit out of the way which can be good or bad depending on your preferences! There are also a bunch of great festivals and things that happen throughout the year.Here is a community calendar.,Yukon,d0hxmek,1,t5_2s8gf

6926997,0,t3_4ajnul,Youre coming in July? You must check out Dawson City Music Festival. ish hour drive north from Whitehorse and is the thing to do in the summer. Being km further north makes daylight last even longer where the land of the midnight sun starts to get a little more literal. Good music and beer Id suggest camping or booking a hotel like....now and on Sunday the bands jam together and make up new bands by mixing up members. ,Yukon,d11i0qy,2,t5_2s8gf
7553892,0,t3_4in9gy,I used to work in construction in whitehorse. There are two suppliers  Territorial and Yukon Enterprises. There are a few other finishing and contracting companies that do concrete although they will most likely get their mix from these two. ,Yukon,d30uaz2,2,t5_2s8gf
7998801,0,t3_4n8qiq,gt Im also very into body modification from more primitive cultures such as piercings and tattoos from Mayan and Indonesian culture and think that getting a traditional aboriginal tattoo would be incredible.Going by your comments you dont seem like a bad guy but seriously... dont do this. And dont call the cultures of the Inuit First Nations or Mayans or Indonesians primitive for that matter. You do know theyre all still around right? Still living dynamic real cultures with languages arts and beliefs? Theyre not just some piece of history you get to imitate because you think it looks cool like someone dressing up as a knight for an SCA tourney. Thats very insulting.Look at it this way. Your culture has been deliberately attacked by a dominant government for roughly the past century in the case of Canadas northern nations. They took your greatgrandparents away from your greatgreatgrandparents locked them up in prisonlike schools where priests beat and raped them and tortured them for speaking their own languages. They did the same thing to your grandparents and to your parents. For generations your people have been told their art language beliefs and skills make them inferior. Then this white guy from the Maritimes comes up and says he wants a tattoo from your primitive culture but dont worry! Itd be done in the most authentic way possible. Yeah listen the most authentic thing for you as far as Native culture goes would be to not try to take part. Youre not a part of it. You never will be. Dont try to pretend like you are. The people up here do not exist to make you feel more special than your friends back home.,Yukon,d4f540x,4,t5_2s8gf
