30461,0,t3_1u4pex,Not exactly what youre looking for but my solution to this is having playlist tabs so currently playing is always in its own playlist like this ,foobar2000,cehweqt,2,t5_2smgq
458349,0,t3_1z5pha,Well if you want a playlist that shows all your music in your media library and automatically updates whenever you add new music try creating an autoplaylist. Go to Library gt Search which will bring up a new window. In the search window usegtpath PRESENT      Present must be typed in all caps. Once you have the results from this search click the button with the ellipsis ... on the top right and click Create autoplaylist. You can use the playlist manager to rename it to whatever you like. This playlist will then automatically hence autoplaylist update when you add or remove music from your library.      I guess then you can switch to and from this playlist when you listen to stuff outside of your music library.,foobar2000,cfsd3k5,2,t5_2smgq

1707909,0,t1_cjtubkw,Yep thats what Im using and it sounds really awkward. I posted a link to a MIDI file and what it should be like my guess is that youll hear what I hear when you play it with foobar.,foobar2000,cjufzdg,1,t5_2smgq
1948845,0,t3_2gzwza,And while Im at it.Im using facets for the Artist list on the left and ESPlaylist to show album tracks middle.When I have Library mode enabled on facets top left of facets column and I click on an artist ESPlaylist will hide all other artists.When I have Playlist mode enabled on facets and click on an artist it will only go to the artist but wont hide the rest.My question is if there is a way to have both only focus on the artist and hide all other bands? It will help with Playlist mode since I have WAY too many artists to go through that I already have listed nicely on my playlists which I have hidden on the bottom of the Facets UI.,foobar2000,cko1eqd,1,t5_2smgq
2393822,0,t1_cm6ux1g,So Im trying to make something like what you have going on in your picture but Ive been having some troubles.

3408833,0,t3_2z9dw0,. enter layout editing mode. right click the window panel above it  the one that you want to take up the whole space and press copy UI elementedit since there are multiple panels in this space you will have to right click on the vertical splitter that contains them all i dont know if its the left or right one but whichever one highlights that whole area when you right click it is the right one. right click the divider between the  UI elements  it can be a little tricky to click on its quite small make sure it says splitter in grey when you right click then press paste UI element. enjoy,foobar2000,cpgtyw9,1,t5_2smgq
3634085,0,t1_cq6f1l6,Bear Its always nice to meet another pleasant being from the animal kingdom.If you click Library then Search enter the query into the box that opens up. If you then click the ellipsis there is an option to create an autoplaylist which will always keep itself up to date. Keep in mind when building your query many of the variables are case sensitive and the qualifiers must be in upper case such as HAS IS NOT DURING GREATER and I am sure there are many others I am missing in there,foobar2000,cq6ihhz,2,t5_2smgq
3835054,0,t1_cqte3p3,Oh yep thanks. That wont work in my scenario sadly as I have quite a few folders in folders thus requiring more than a foldergtfile setup hence why a treeview is required. But thank you for your thoughts its much appreciated.,foobar2000,cqtfh3m,1,t5_2smgq
4097814,0,t1_crn9rys,I dont exactly know how the algorithm looks like but this should be possible with a plugin. It shouldnt be too hard since Ive seen this feature in quite a lot of places most recently in my launcher on android. It changes the UI colors to match the wallpaper. I might make an attempt at it but dont expect anything since Ive never made a plugin for fbk before.,foobar2000,crndk90,1,t5_2smgq

I dont have any experience with Facets so Im not sure how to offer help with how to better display information on the track currently playing etc. In terms of the playback order you can right click on your menu bar choose Toolbars then Playback Order. This will toggle a dropdown that displays the current playback order this dropdown can also change the playback order. ,foobar2000,d82qvd7,1,t5_2smgq
