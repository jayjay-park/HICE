6836786,0,t3_49d1sr,You clearly dont understand this subreddit. The whole point is to make fun or circlejerk about whatever goes on in rbaseball. The reason why I even circlejerk about the Cubs is because  its a thing on rbaseball and  its what I really first started doing when I first went on baseballcirclejerk. In reality I dont give two shits about the Cubs since Im a Marlins fan while typicalcub is a legit Cubs fan. All three of us are completely different users. Outside this sub all I talk about are the Marlins and Miami Heat. Theres no way I would manage multiple accounts that have different affiliations with different teams. Ive seen analogboy on rbaseball as well and hes a Mariners fan. The only reason why this pasta is relevant is because it encaptulates the actual Cubs circlejerk that goes on over on rbaseball so people post it here to make fun of it. Its like saying just because  different users repost the navy seal pasta then the same person must run all three accounts and upvote each other.,baseballcirclejerk,d0r933i,5,t5_2unj4
