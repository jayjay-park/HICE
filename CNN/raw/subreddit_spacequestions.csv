6338712,0,t1_cza4y3m,Its a perfectly valid idea to reuse blood thats left someones body its just not super practical. Your character is probably going to have to MacGyver a device out of existing medical equipment because its really not a firstplan kind of thing. Its really hard to injure yourself in space in a way that isnt going to kill you right away so theres no reason to spend tons of money on making available blood thats either going to be frozen an inaccessible or liquid and fast to spoil.,spacequestions,cza53ax,2,t5_2ysdy
6720458,0,t3_47obbc,I dont know the specifics of the SpaceX launch but there are various reasons for launch windows for geostationary satellites The SES launch is a supersynchronous orbit so the apogee is beyond the actual geostationary orbit. This indicates that the spacecraft itself is performing the inclination change not the rocket. Since the inclination change has to be initiated during an equatorial crossing there are certain limitations on the point of the perigee and apogee over earth limiting the allowed time to launch. The move of the eclipse. You dont want to separate your spacecraft in the eclipse so once earth has rotated so that your separation would occur in the eclipse you have to wait for the separation point to be outside of the eclipse again. The ground station network. You want your big manoeuvres to occur at a time when you have the longest visibility of the satellite  since we have an inclined initial orbit this sets limitations on your launch window to ensure that you can make best use of the ground stations.And on top of that theres a lot of logistics  theyre renting ground stations that are shared with other missions they have primary and secondary teams that need to be on shift during that specific time without a shift handover to occur at a bad point in the timeline and whatever else you can imagine.,spacequestions,d0egc2m,5,t5_2ysdy
