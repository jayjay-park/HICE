If youre doing that then you can power it through any of the  sets on the motor pins.For your FrSky RSSI you dont need a ground or  cable.

6336921,0,t1_cz9xjw4,It doesnt do way points I dont think. I may be mistaken but its a little bit of a stripped back flight controller hence the Lite but for rocksteady GPS hold on a quadcopter its pretty hard to beat it for the money. Much easier to tune than the APM . which is in a similar price range. With regards to other components personally Id spend a couple of quid more on the ESCs and get some of the Hobbywing A Xrotor ESCs theyre much better rated however they dont contain a BEC battery elimination circuit to run LEDs etc. but the Naza Lite has a power module which will also power your RC receiver so the BEC functionality is not really needed.The only reason I recommend different ESCs is that I have heard of woes with the Afro ESCs whereas everyone I know who is flying with the hobbywing ESCs havent had a single whiff of an issue with them.The only thing your original parts list is missing is random accessoriesparts  some battery connectors Id suggest XT connectors .mm bullet connectors any LED strip lighting you might wanna put on the craft for navigation and a way of dropping the voltage for low power components.C,multicopterbuilds,cz9xruq,1,t5_37gqp

6773400,0,t1_d0k190m,As a general rule you want to find the max amperage draw for your propmotor combo then add  to figure your minimum esc rating.  This will make your system mostly bulletproof.  You can still run lower amperage escs but they wont hold up to  throttle so it depends how you plan to fly.  For a racer you can just assume that youre going to be pulling max amps at certain points in your flight.  Why limit yourself with your equipment?If you look at the data sheet for the RS at least on banggood it will give a range of values that seem to correspond with different throttle positions.  Youre only drawing those  amps on the last few ticks of the throttle stick but those last few ticks might just burn up your system so proceed with caution.  ,multicopterbuilds,d0k1pxe,2,t5_37gqp

7179468,0,t3_4dtqf9,Ok I looked at the pics and the props look like they are installed correctly. Are they turning the correct way?You need to push on the leading edge to spin down a self tightening prop. Is that how they thread on?Make sure they are tightened. the prop has inertia and if you have a braking esc it will slow the motor down instead of free wheeling which can unscrew the prop.Taking a closer look at the pictures. I suspect the props might be on upside down maybe. Its really hard to tell.  The concave side of the prop needs to face the ground and the convex side faces the sky.For your yaw orientation issue just set the yaw thing to  instead of  and see if it acts correctly.,multicopterbuilds,d1u8or0,1,t5_37gqp

The camera that comes with the ET is terrible. Look into getting a Sony Super HAD or HS.  The motors and ESCs will not work with s batteries. Start with a s.  cm is a very long antenna extension cable. Get something shorter unless you need it that long.

However as far as camera choice goes you have exactly one if you want to retain decent video recording  the D. If all you want is FPV of course you can throw on any analog camera.,multicopterbuilds,deynl37,1,t5_37gqp

11286651,0,t1_dfbaofe,Nothing wrong with that if you are always going to be within range of bluetooth or wifi. I figured something like that would need a lot of computing power but that would be a cool system to play around with. Im not sure what your approach to this project is but I would suggest doing the least amount possible for the lowest cost possible on your first attempt. e.g. build a working quad with an off the shelf FC. I did not do that I went straight to the Arduino and printing my own frame etc.. If I could do it again I would buy off the shelf parts and just try to make that work first. Once you get the basics of building and flying move on to the more complex DIY stuff. Seriously though the camera tracking thing sounds like an awesome project. I would definitely like to see that happen lol.EDIT Check out the reference build wiki on this sub. Knowing what I know now I would try to emulate that for my first attempt. The site I linked earlier also has a good parts list.,multicopterbuilds,dfbbqa0,3,t5_37gqp
11371492,0,t3_629hgw,You wont be able to use the Inductrix frame. Why not go for Insane mm motors and go straight Tiny Whoop? Purchase some Welders glue as well for frame strengthening and repairs.,multicopterbuilds,dfkxrbc,1,t5_37gqp
11392134,0,t1_dfn8tzu,You may not be able to take off with s. I was making a similar build in ecalc t hex and according to ecalc it needed s. I was playing with the thing with s last night and the motors seem slow quanum  . Im betting thats because s is needed for larger motors.,multicopterbuilds,dfna5fl,1,t5_37gqp
11413144,0,t1_dfpmnb0,Oh all of this was with the same iron. ,multicopterbuilds,dfpo37h,1,t5_37gqp
11531546,0,t1_dg31zq7,alright thanks a lot! I will definitely flash betaflight when I am rebuilding that copter. I just didnt have time yet..And for the motors what would you say is better about the KingKong vs the Racerstar motors? ,multicopterbuilds,dg33pnv,1,t5_37gqp
11532048,0,t1_dg33pnv,Durability. The racerstar alloy is too weak.At least for the BR idk about the BRS,multicopterbuilds,dg35rdk,2,t5_37gqp
11664404,0,t1_dgi64he,I asked if there was any obvious critical error or stuff that would be ok for a couple flights but would improve my flying experience noticeably.,multicopterbuilds,dgi6bea,1,t5_37gqp
