Im pretty sure if it were in the US there would be an EnglishSpanish combination printed there. There are small niche stores with only Spanish but a market that size would have both IMHO.The yellow bus is also used there in PR so that was another factor.

3550806,0,t3_30uxw0,I wasnt able to find an active PPD forum but I have an idea. Why not start your own subreddit?There are several Personality Disorder subs in addition to some for mental health anxiety and general advice. You could visit each one of them and announce what you done and invite people to take a look ask questions andor join.It would be slow at first. So maybe use the place as a public daily journal of your feelings and concerns. You could even post links to interesting articles that youve run across.I believe that in time youd have a membership of like minded people who could help one another.

10561914,0,t1_dd55mlb,Ah! I did some more digging and I found what youre talking about here. The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who have been convicted of any criminal offense have been charged with any criminal offense where such charge has not been resolved have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits are subject to a final order of removal but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States or in the judgment of an immigration officer otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.Read the entire article. From what were being TOLD at least this is an attempt to include seemingly all undocumented immigrants. Albeit a very racist stereotypical and therefore ineffective attempt as it is. From what we know right now this does not apply to immigrants who are legally documented.Im surprised I didnt see this order on whitehouse.gov when I was looking for the other order to send you.

SMS short codes are spendy about  dollars. Also unless youre working closely with the charity dont take donations on their behalf it can get tricky tax wise and you just dont want to be accountable for money if you dont need to be. If you must I like venmo  fees are minimal and people can donate and include a message with a song request. Or if the relay is using a peertopeer fundraising platform perhaps you can have them set up a page just for dj requests where people can donate.
