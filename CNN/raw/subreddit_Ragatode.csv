7863244,0,t3_4n119w,PART HAWKING HALL CAMBRIDGE. SECRET HEADQUARTERS OF THE SMEN.  JUNE Pleasure to meet you said the man with the receding hairline and wearing thick oval spectacles. He had skin the colour of grass with patches of yellow as if afflicted by an atypical vitiligo. You can call me Peas. The man extended a hand to me and I shook it.Beast? I asked.No no. Peas corrected the man. Its a sort of code name or nickname that the Smen gave me. My real names Mendel.Peas was one of the founding members of the Smen. He was the first one I approached said Stephen Hawking as he circled the table in his wheelchair. There were several other members seated around the round table. They looked as if they were all plucked out of time. Some of them I knew from history books and legends. But others were unknown to me. Stephen Hawking slowly made his way around the table and introduced each member of the Smen to me one by one.There was the renowned Leonardo da Vinci. He sat at the far end of the table quiet and alone with his thoughts. But what was peculiar about his appearance was not just his long voluminous beard but rather a set of wings that were folded behind his back. From this distance I couldnt deduce what sort of material it was made out of but it seemed like some sort of amalgamation or hybrid consisting of lightweight metals plastics and feathers. Sitting just to the right of da Vinci was none other than Sir Isaac Newton. Many knew him for his work with gravity and the legend of the apple falling from the tree. But true science aficionados know that Newton conducted many experiments with light prisms and refraction. Newton looked different to the illustrations that I have seen of him in textbooks. This Newton in front of me still had the characteristic curly locks of hair but he also wore a strange device around his eyes like some sort of visor. Peas explained to me that it was a contraption that allowed Newton to control the optic blasts that he could shoot from his eyes. The visor was composed of a unique material whose refractive index could be dynamically altered to allow different refraction of Newtons optic beams. Out of the group of men sitting around the table there was only one woman. Her name was Marie Curie. I knew of her by word of mouth. She worked with radioactivity. Peas and Hawking both told me later in private not to get on her bad side. Hawking who had been to the future described a time that was yet to happen when Marie attracted the force of a cosmic entity called the Plutonium Power. The details of this were a bit sketchy as the future is constantly being rewritten by events of the current time. Professor Hawking told me not to worry about such matters for the time being because cosmic threats were usually dealt with by another organisation led by Hawkings friend Captain Fermi.The last member was John Dalton. He was known for his pioneering work on the atomic theory. The diagrams that he once used to illustrate how atoms and molecules arrange themselves are still used today. Dalton demonstrated his abilities to me by rearranging his own molecular structure into a crystalline arrangement similar to ice. I was absolutely flabbergasted. Wow this is all very amazing Professor H I mumbled. But with talent like this why do you even need me? My powers pale in comparison to your team.That is relative replied Professor H. Besides we can never have too much help against our ongoing struggles.What struggles? I asked.Not every scientist that the Professor recruits shares the same ideals as us replied Peas. He nimbly leapt on top of the table and stretched his arms out in front of him. There was a faint rumbling sound in the distance and then came the noise of small objects rolling across the floor. I looked down at my feet and saw hundreds if not thousands of frozen peas tumbling across the tiles and coming together to form an image on the ground. It was a picture of a mans head with short wavy hair and a stern expression on his face. I did not recognise who it was.Michael Faraday said Professor H as if he had read the unasked question in my mind. He did not believe in my values and so he left to create his own team of scientists. Although he has some good ideas the execution of those ideas often leaves death and destruction in its wake. This is why I need you Dr Einstein. To join my team. To put an end to Electromagneto.,Ragatode,d3zwf2m,1,t5_3ebm3
