He most likely would  not have been caught if he added them in small increments but I never would have tried something like buying k tickets for  because k tickets is worth about  which means you would be only saving  when everything is all said and done.I think the original poster was sketchy because he wasnt telling the entire truth.,DaveAndBusters,cewgs1z,1,t5_2sznh
598392,0,t3_1zplci,Actually most the coupons they are using this year do all have the same barcode from the ones that Ive seen. You can only use one per power card per day but they do work. If they are trying to sell you the ones from the surveys or from signing up then yes stay away. But the ones with the code  E are fine those are good until the end of the year. These are the ones found on the back of the business cards in this listing you can tell that the tickets expire at the end of March but them having the same barcode would have no effect.,DaveAndBusters,cg8ah7c,1,t5_2sznh

At this point I left..  After attendant came over he saw the glitch and busted some other couple for all their tickets.. I was long gone with a total of little over k tickets,DaveAndBusters,cnlvb1d,9,t5_2sznh

3127591,0,t3_2vn3xj,Well yeah. Like virtually every other game at DampB Monopoly Arcade does its best to adhere to a certain payout percentage. Imagine if a person with perfect muscle memory could just land on every Best Roll Bonus Wheel and Boardwalk they stumble upon. DampB would be out quite a bit of money in which thered be no reason for them to have the game in the Midway in the first place.So after having come to terms with that I just play every now and then and hope I get lucky. Usually I can accurately estimate how much force I need to land on a particular number and if the outcome is wildly different from what I expected Ill just chalk it up to the game not being ready to pay out big yet.Oh and I suppose you havent faced this yet  If you receive multiple multipliers in a game you do NOT automatically keep the higher. Instead the latest multiplier simply overrides the one before. I cannot tell you how much of a slap to the face it was when early in the game I earned a x multiplier only to spin again later and have it replaced by a x. Better than x or x but still. It was a good game and that move probably screwed me of over k.The game is indeed against the players favor but why wouldnt it be? Fortunately not a lot of people realize that which is why they still play and as a result youll get a better chance to win big. Perhaps as much as k... Boardwalk and x was an amazing experience.,DaveAndBusters,com68kf,1,t5_2sznh
3133977,0,t1_com68kf,Ok thanks. I didnt realize that about the multipliers. I know the maximum tickets you can win is  so I guess thats why you can only keep one multiplier. ,DaveAndBusters,comu1n3,1,t5_2sznh

I go with my friend trying to break her into DampB and showing her some of the game strategies.  Some observations Pop it n Win gets played more often. I saw the balloon pop times tonight. Candy Crush Saga also gets a lot of play. I learned that clearing a level gets you a spin on the bonus wheel. Someone got lucky and won  in the bonus spin. I still dont know exactly what the strategy is to clear all the candies. Specifically how to clear the candies surrounded by gel which act as power ups in clearing rows and similar candies off the game board. Maybe someone can explain? Full Tilt rarely gets played. I went for the score bonus on Yahtzee and missed but won  tickets. Sometimes you can hold the s s and s and still get unlucky on the dice pop not scoring enough for the bonus. ,DaveAndBusters,csaijly,1,t5_2sznh

4581773,0,t1_ct80ren,Gotcha. No one tell Catastrophe that it was in our West Nyack NY store in September and October of last year.Really I was surprised by that one. I loved the technology and thought people would really flock to the game. But I think the gameplay was difficult and a little tough for some people to pick up quickly. The dialogue was all in Japanese. It was styled as a Japanesestyle sitdown cabinet. And the pacing was a little slow. As a result it only had about  of the plays of the much older shooter game right next to it.The good news is that in a weird way it really brought us closer to Konami.I hear you about unreleased games but we intentionally dont promote them because were really trying to understand how they would perform if we bought them and put them everywhere.

5195572,0,t3_3m3ijw,Ah yes good ole Speed of Light.  My location takes good care of it as I let them know which lights are broken and exactly how and what needs doneordered each week.  Its been more than  months since Ive seen it have  working lights as parts are always on backorder.  Currently  lights are broken but I was still able to JP it continuously tonight.  There is always one to three lights that are broken in some manner.  That handicap doesnt affect me as Ive adapted to be able to still JP it every time.  Its when it gets worse is when I have an issue.  In regards to other DampB locations I wont lie their SoL machines are in absolute shit condition.  The NYC one requires you to punch the shit out of each and every light in order for it to trigger that was in Sept the Pittsburgh location had at least  busted lights the last time I was there Nov and last month the Charlotte NC location had  broken lights that would autotrigger in other words I would trigger the anticheating mechanism within a second.  Making it completely unplayable.  This is one of those games where you have to let the techs or the amusement manager know each and every week what is wrong with it.  If they dont do anything about it give them a bad review and specify to fix SoL on the surveys each week.  This game takes a damn beating and is high maintenance not all locations take the proper care to it.  FYI Anticheating mechanism  an algorithm the machines control board uses that takes into consideration how many lights are pressed within a time frame location of pressed lights as well as how many lights are hit at the same time.  Its to discourage multiple people playing on one player mode.  When triggered the multiplier is disabled high score and JP bonus are disabled.  Im able to trigger it by myself when theres more than one broken light that autotriggers.  EDIT My best SoL game yet  A  second game meaning  seconds remaining,DaveAndBusters,cvc9dxd,1,t5_2sznh

5642123,0,t3_3sd5ak,There are a few new games but I think anything APable has been around for more thn that long.KungFu Panda is newish as is Down the Clown but you should have had Down the Clown before you had WhackNWin and Whack has been around a year.  Angry Birds is new Spongebob Pineapple Arcade is new think Spongebob has sex with the Wizard of Oz coin pusher and there you go.Theres some game Im waiting on called The Vault that I have not yet seen show up.  Gridiron Blitz is new and someone mentioned how to play it in this sub.Prizes  the XBox bundle got updated the games are fairly new Super Mario Maker and Yoshis Woolly World for WiiU Halo  Call of Duty Black Ops  the new Assassins Creed are worth picking up.  They did an overhaul on their prize case in September.Ticketless  fucking amazing.  If you are an advantage player or going to become one its your best friend.Shit you need to know about TicketlessIf your card is set up for ticketless tickets will go on the last ticketless card swiped.  So if you have chips to play on card A but a small amount on card B and you want tickets to go on card B swipe a bunch with card A and once with card B and the tickets will all go to B.You cannot add credits while the game is paying out  whether or not you are using a ticketless card.Ticketless is much faster  as in the game sends the electronic pulses that would normally go to the ticket dispenser to your card you can often hear the dispenser clicking on some of the older games but it knows not to spit out tickets.  Games with multiple ticket dispensers Spin Slam will pay amazingly fast while games that always had very slow dispensers Tippin will still pay somewhat slow.  Though some games do get a huge boost  Speed Demon pays out physical tickets slowly but gives you ticketless payouts  times faster at least.If you find credits on a machine and its a machine with a jackpot that can only be hit once easily or raises in difficulty after being hit you may not want to play to win on the first credit if theres more than one credit because you dont know if the last person to swipe has their card up for ticketless.  There have been times Ive found a credit on Cyclone managed to jackpot it and then went oh shit.  Thats going to the card of the person who put the credit on there.  If you see credits on a machine and want to make sure youre going to reap the rewards youll need to swipe and pay once yourself.  There are times where it wont even be worth doing that and you can just be nice and try to win something for the other person.The card readers after youve swiped once now have a button on them to put another credit on the machine and another button to check your ticketchip balances.  Though if you need to rapidload credits to a machine and do so quickly its actually quicker to pull the card out and immediately slide it back in.Theres also the DampB Mobile App which lets you check your balance on the fly charge your card if youre not using the purchasing chips thread advice and also every other week has a builtin for coupon.,DaveAndBusters,cwwgk4w,1,t5_2sznh

There is a guard at the door at all times at our location to enforce this policy now. Plus anyone under  has to be with a responsible person over the age of  I think. Since they have a policy on child supervision I would imagine you could get a child in trouble or a parent for not watching their child while others are spending money and playing. I would also mention this policy to the parents of the child.I dont go to DampB often but most kids in there are so stupid they just keep swiping the card and literately get amusement out of that draining all their credits in a matter of a few minutes wonder how many times the staff has had to deal with parents complaining because their little angels power card is now drained of credits within a few minutes of purchasing it.

You can only get them after having spent  at the place and given your situation I dont think youll be dropping  anytime soon. Just know that the chips you get regularly coupon or otherwise never expire while the Reward Chips expire in  days. On the offchance you do spend enough to come across said Reward Chips should you have those along with regular chips on any one card the Reward Chips balance will be used first.

The true hypothetical perfect prize would have to beSomething of high value so that a small number of them could be flipped for a large effect no more than  a month at absolute maximum.Something that does not have a serial number or can otherwise be easily exchanged for either its retail value or something that can be exchanged for something else that can be easily turned into its retail value.Something that is priced by DampB ticketwise at or below the gold standard.I dont think a prize like this exists.  I have heard there are prizes that are massively underpriced compared to what someone can get for them but I havent gotten into that market because it is not a steady one there is a fair bit of competition and it would exceed the  item a year mark.  The games are good and generously priced but the competition on those is cutthroat and you have to be as hitandrun with moving those as you do with sniper jackpots!This is going to be a very interesting conservative time for a few months.

Knights got that range too so he gets it in when he makes his rounds. Also shoutout to BosDaddy for coming through on hell week and respecting the farm and much respect for asking.  I didnt mean to come across as bossy and I didnt know I was in the presence of CR royalty at the time lol. Most nonredditing CR  FT players dont care in TSQ and Ive seen ppl tryhard to  on a  JP here on both games.   tickets short run just aint worth trading off K with  minutes of work when you consider that an overshoot of the JP can trigger a  jump.

10179755,0,t1_dbxv5vb,Well theres your issue.  That star trek Pusher.   Did you turn in everything you won?  Assuming you played for a while you should have a stack of cards.  Now your best bet is to snipe cards or wait for them to be stacked up in the corners.   The other is to play the side that is about to get a bonus.  I have a few vids of winning free cards and ticket tokens this way.  Ive sworn off the card pushers.  It got quite additive for a while.  I find what most people do is keep their calculations separate.   Go practice APing games with good returns and see how you are doing.  Then just play card pushers knowing that the money is spent for fun.  ,DaveAndBusters,dbxxjhw,2,t5_2sznh

Luckily my home location has neither of those guards.  On an unrelated note if you machine is lacking bags check in front of the marquee as people tend to throw them high and they get stuck up there.  Additionally check behind the machine on the floor as they also tend to end up there.  That should help out keeping the amount as close to  as possible.  Worst case you just ask a tech to refill it.
