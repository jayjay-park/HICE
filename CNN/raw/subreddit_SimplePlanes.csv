3005311,0,t1_co9gepr,only time i had some gyro scoping effects was with a bigger blade build and putting a small prop engine on the tail facing left fixed it. It still rolled right not yaw. Other than that this build doesnt have much rotational forces due to the game physics not supporting thatmentioned in another chopper thread. Im thinking it has to do with drag somehow but even when mirrored it still rolled once it started flying forward not while hovering which makes me thinks its just too buggy to help. My Apache tho choppy in flight due too rough surfaces around the propeller shaft doesnt have the same thing going on. Maybe the mass of this chopper makes it more noticeable.,SimplePlanes,co9hydf,1,t5_30a8y

5041947,0,t1_cutnmu8,I guess the big question is HOW youre going to eh enforce this Councils rule. Are the devs going to give admin rights of the site to you? Is reddit?If not you are powerless. Or so it seems to me if the council cant permaban someone what can it do? Say tsk tsk naughty boy? Rate single stars? Youre doing that already.AFAIK the admins  owners are by law responsible for whats on their site. Nazism bestiality those things are big nono and the site admins can get in trouble over it. Porn however Im sure Rule  also goes for aircraft is usually allowed whether you metaphysical like it or not. Like gay marriage so to speak. What the Council proposes is a narrowing of legal liberties. You see mr. Poo is allowed to be an ahole. You dont have to like him but he has the right to make himself ridiculous to the world.So the Council has an eh artistic function. A social average a peer group. Which then if it were allowed could block any innovation it did not like. Remember its the crazies who come up with the plans that save the world not the traffic wardens. A lot of what those crazies make is well crazy. But some of it is very useful indeed. Like oh a while ago everyone thought Galileo was a dangerous idiot.A Council translated in Russian  Sovjet by the way is I think not possible without help of The Powers that Already Be. And theyre not doing much about it now so why should they change policy?It should also include everyone.

And then there seems to be no logic in the order of the parts ie. not be name or date etc... I think I saw some early posts on this but just wanted to make sure!,SimplePlanes,cvwlzfn,2,t5_30a8y
5920914,0,t3_3wbr6k,In the XML file find the wing piece you want to rotate. You will see a value called Rotation in the syntax of    RotationI dont have SP at work but I think somebody check my memory that the values correlate to X Y and Z axes respectively. To change the angle of attack of a normal stabilizer change the first of the three values. To angle them upwards which would bring the nose down make it a positive value. To point them downwards bring the nose up put in a negative value. For example    Rotationwould pitch the stabiliser down one degree. ,SimplePlanes,cxvrhh4,1,t5_30a8y

If its supposed to legitimately mark the skilled builders then  seconds is ideal.
