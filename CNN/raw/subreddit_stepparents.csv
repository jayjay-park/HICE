591231,0,t3_20wr64,Holy crap. Well first THANK GOD that kid has you in his life. Seriously wtf is wrong with people. Im sure as you are that K is not okay in any way because seriously how could he be? That being said even if he cant be in counseling right now at least you can just BE there for him. Be stability be the one thing he knows he can count on. This is so so huge. Do not undervalue the role youre playing in his life. Im pretty sure youre the only think keeping him upright at this point. Keep encouraging him keep reminding him that hes a great kid and that its not because of HIM that his bio parents are not involved. I have some glimpse of how this goes because my daughters dad is pretty uninvolved and its been really hard for her. She feels like its her fault that he doesnt love her. Or she used to shes in a much better place now. But for years I just had to tell her over and over again that it wasnt her it was just how her dad was that she is an amazing person. Also I think you could get him into counseling if you pay cash and dont go through insurance. Write whatever you need to on the forms. A decent counselor will get why this is important and not get all wound about you not being a bio parent.I guess I dont have any advice except to say that youre in a ridiculously difficult position and are being overthetop incredibly awesome.,stepparents,cg7h686,19,t5_2t08x

I tried to change the topic and said something like I love my little buddy I enjoy spending time with him while making it plainly clear that my SS was right next to me. So then the asshole points to the kid and says something like you might think you love him but wait until you have one of your own thats when youll know what love is.  I was so pissed. If my SS hadnt been holding my hand that situation might have ended differently than how it did but he was so instead I picked up my little buddy gave him a hug and left. ,stepparents,cgiwlha,7,t5_2t08x
905001,0,t1_ch6zh85,The process has to start with talking to the bio mom your husband needs to and your stepson needs to. Maybe if she sees that hes serious shell agree if hes persistent. That parts free. If everyone agrees you can get that notarized for el cheapo or free at your bank and file it with the court for the filing fee only again probably depends on your county. I understand wanting to skip that part but theres zero protection if you do. She can agree to him moving in with you then turn around and file contempt charges claiming that youre keeping him from her on her scheduled visitation. And if you dont have anything in writing that shows shes lying youre kinda screwed. Not saying she will pull something like this but it is possible and its smart to protect yourself  more importantly its smart to protect your stepson from getting caught in the middle of that kind of ugliness.,stepparents,ch75k07,2,t5_2t08x

1317902,0,t1_cifbd9n,gt My theory is that the animosity from biomom towards stepmom begins when biomom hasnt resolved her emotional issues post divorce and clings to her children as her sole identity. This is only one possibility. There is no one single reason that animosity can exist. In my case I was the one who left and had no interest in spending any emotion on my ex. There was initial animosity with my DDs SMtobe because she tried to insert herself into parenting decisions thinking she could mediate and having no idea of abuse her fiance had heaped on me making mutual decisions an impossibility. About a year in she realized that she was not an unbiased mediator and stated out of parenting decisions and things improved.,stepparents,cihvpzr,1,t5_2t08x

1809059,0,t3_2f9hx4,At least she seems to be agreeing he can be in your school district. You and your husband are also on the same page. Be thankful for that and that you have the chance to be there for your stepson. Once it is established that hes going to school in your district and you guys are the stable ones I hope it gets easier if you need to take any further action. Also document! Save any written communications. It would also be helpful to send a certified letter to biomom at her new address make sure to write the certified number on the letter inside too just outlining the agreement. Its a paper trail for later if you need it. Im not a lawyer and I dont know what state you are in but my lawyer friend told me that as a tip. NOTE Not a lawyer Im not giving legal advice My stepsons mom moves every month or two without any regard as to how far away she moves from the school district and DEMANDS her  days a week. Last year he missed over  days of school on her custody days the school never called and we only caught it when the nd semester report card came out and pretty much went What the hell?!. My husband refuses to go for full custody because she might one day become a better mom. This causes a lot of friction in our relationship as we both spend a lot of time traveling to pick up my stepson trying to get him to school on her custody days.Do what you can for the little man. Im sure he appreciates it more than you could ever know. He is getting old enough now to know whats up and who he can rely on. Better to establish that now before hes in high school.,stepparents,ck75yif,4,t5_2t08x
1828479,0,t1_ck8um6q,Thank you for all the great advice!I completely understand what youre saying with the room thing and it is definitely something I can try the way our house is the master is downstairs so the only things up stairs are the kids rooms and bathroom lol so I can be ok with just letting them keep their space dirty I am also very relieved to hear that this gross phase will pass! I just worry about her being treated differently. She is already quite over weight another issue with her mom an  year old doesnt need a oz soda! but Ive given up on that she eats better with us and thats all I can do. Though I do have to give her the veggies only first when she finishes those she can have the rest of her meal. Luckily I was enthusiastically backed up on this one by her dad and that makes people treat her differently I lost lbs  years ago and heavier people are really treated very differently I worry about her being smelly and dirty on top of it. Especially now that boys are starting to take interest in the girls and lets face it kids are mean all by themselves but when you add raging hormones to it it only gets worse. I guess its that instinct to want to protect them as much as possible and take away anything that might cause them hard feelings. But my question here is how did you handle it with your BD? I obviously cant really do much with my SD except pray she grows out of it sooner rather than later but my daughter doesnt have an issue with the showering right now. I worry though that if she sees that those same rules arent across the board that it will cause issues. How did you handle it? We did talk more about the picking up issue and I basically said exactly what you said and he said he understood and he is going to talk to her a little later tonight after the kids go to bed so hopefully we can come to a peaceful understanding. thank you again for everything you said. ,stepparents,ck9ivcz,2,t5_2t08x

Ultimately you didnt have to do anything you could have easily stayed inside and not gone out of your way to talk to her  and you wouldve been completely justified in doing so because it was your fathers wake. However you went out voluntarily and showed grace to BM which says a ton about you as a person and sets an example for your SD...and isnt that the most important part anyway? I understand your frustration and Im incredibly sorry for your loss but give yourself a little credit for being an awesome and gracious example of how a lady behaves even in the face of a really crappy situation. ,stepparents,ckphauz,9,t5_2t08x
2245751,0,t3_2ksyqg,This is a pretty common thing. Bioparents often invite a stepparent to take on a more parental role but then bristle when they actually do. Its freaking maddening. But its also understandable.The reality is even biological parents who are happily married dont always agree with how each person is towards the kids in every situation. OR even when they agree ideologically one parent softens up easily in reality and buckles where the other parent doesnt and then one parent feels like the other is being too hard on the kids while the other resents being forced to be the disciplinarian. Its a common dynamic even when the relationships are all equal. So its no surprise that when the relationships are unequal it can come up.With my SO I have just resorted to a severalstep process. If something is bothering me I bring it up when we are alone. If he agrees with me ideologically I say that I dont feel he has my back in reality when Im dealing with the kids and that if he does not have my back on this point then I will not help him enforce that ruleexpectationetc. And then if he either disagrees that its an issue or agrees that its an issue but fails to support me in dealing with it re his kids I just remove myself from the equation. It is not always easy. It drives me crazy that the year old does not turn off his bedroom light but it drives me more crazy that my SO does not want to nag him about it. What nagging I feel like  hes never TOLD THE KID that he wants him to do it! However my SO just doesnt want to make it a thing. I however totally would. If they were my kids. And so I am just not going to go and turn it off every morning. Im sorry I know it seems fucking petty as all hell. But if my SO is not going to ever once mention it to his son then that light is going to stay on all day until he gets home from work and turns it off. Because I spent A YEAR turning it off myself and will spend the next ten years turning it off if my SO never gets to a point where hes like Fuck this shit and just mentions to the kid that we expect him to turn off his bedroom light when he is leaving for school. If there are areas that you and your girlfriend are not seeing eye to eye on you need to have a conversation about them. See if she disagrees with you or if she is just having a hard time enforcing expectations she actually agrees with. If she disagrees or if she agrees but will not support you in supporting her ie enforcing them with her then you will need to step aside in those situations. The biological parent needs to be the one in control of the discipline at the end of the day. We never have me in a disciplinary role except in support of my SO and in support of expectations he has already verbalized to the kids. We talk like equals behind closed doors after the kids have gone to bed  and he listens a lot to what I think and sometimes changes his mind or his behavior  and he comes to me often for advice on a given behavioral problem  but as far as the kids know every single thing that is an expectation for them is something he came up with on his own that I support him in upholding. It works better that way for many families. Discipline and behavior are hard things for even biological parents who have been in control since Day  to get a handle on its just too hard to bring in a relative newcomer and have him suddenly start giving orders.,stepparents,clpadfa,0,t5_2t08x
2253455,0,t3_2kzzsj,Youre more than welcome here. As a bio parent and stepparent myself I wish we had more bio parents invested in developing positive relationships with their kids stepparents. There certainly are some stepparents who adopt an entitlement attitude toward their skids which I really disagree with. As a stepmom Ive always felt that my role in my SDs life exists solely at the discretion of her biological parents and I think thats the appropriate place for me to be. I think your kids smom is overstepping in a big way and she does not sound pleasant. I mean its great that she wants to be involved but theres a line and shes crossing it.My advice to you is the same thing Id say to a stepmom posting about a biomom acting the way youre describing the bio parents need to parent the kids and communicate about parenting the kids directly to each other never through the stepparents. Stepparents should not be making parenting decisions to the point that you amp smom are getting into arguments over her actions. ,stepparents,clq8zcc,17,t5_2t08x

2383154,0,t3_2movik,My SOs son was diagnosed with ODD this year before he turned . His behavior and violence in school caused us to seek counselling for him.Biomom is homeless several states away and my ss has spent a lot of time with his grandmother. My so works out of town seven days then is home for seven. Weve been together for almost three years but this year I started taking care of my ss a lot more. He only stays with his grandmother for a few hours after school while Im still at work. At the end of his school year in May my ss had become unbearable. Anything I asked him to do he would scream at me or hit me. He would do anything to not listen to me. When the summer came things got easier because he wasnt in school. But now this school year I am  involved with school. When his father isnt home my ss will refuse to do homework. Hell throw tantrums before and after school hell threaten to stab me if I dont give into his demands. Him I wont do homework until you put my Xbox back in my room. Me I dont negotiate with terrorists.Anyway he will not act this way with his father because he is afraid of his dad. He will not act this way with his grandmother because she gives him anything he wants. But he acts this way with me and school.His counselor says this is a learned behavior he feels that my ss is use to women coming in and out of his life so he expects to get what he wants and then they leave. He hates authority and the Chinese oddly enough and he has no respect for women. But the counselor says this is a learned behavior and it can be unlearned. I am strict. I never back down from my punishments and I never give in to what he wants. If he sneaks food into his room after hes had a tantrum about dinner every toy gets taken away. No tv. No video games. If he refuses to do homework he has to sit at the desk doing nothing until bedtime. If hes bad in school we will not go pick him up he has to be in Iss. Every kid is different. My counselor has me write in a behavior journal every day so we can pin point problems and good things. Always reward and compliment good behavior. I am strict and never give in when punishing. Its definitely a long unpleasant road. But I love this kid as much as I hate him sometimes and I cant abandon him when he needs someone there for him the most.

2538543,0,t3_2or7qb,.  I dont know about the hivemind aspect but yeah early on in the relationship as the step we dont have a very solid footing and we certainly dont have the emotional capital necessary to do much more than play defense with the other bio parent.  We have a choice in how we respond and we also have a choice to let the past treatment go.  My earliest days interacting with my wifes exhusband werent smooth sailing.  Fast forward a few years to last night and there we were sharing a table in a small diner supporting our sons at a fundraiser.  I had a choice to forgive or bear grudge. I chose forgive..  That is pretty much how it works in any relationship.  We all tend to give someone else the benefit of the doubt initially in a relationship but we also form our expectations of the relationship from our previous experiences.  If I am used to my ex dragging home the latest run down shitbag she can find Im probably not going to waste a lot of time getting my hopes up for the next guy.  Does that mean I unfairly burden the next guy with the sins of his predecessors?  Yeah there is probably something to that but if I keep those thoughts to myself and give them a chance to prove me wrong I have only hurt myself with the premature judgement.  Sadly Im still waiting to be proved wrong but that is a story for another thread.  Yeah I can definitely see this perspective.  .

And on top of that when your daughter spends her winter break with us and has nightmares about you stealing her away and being forced to go to court and pick a parent  dont try to make it all better by buying her a puppy and lying through your teeth court is not out of your hands theres not even a fucking court date scheduled yet you lying cunt.Id say Im sorry for the language but Im not. I have zero respect for you because youre incapable of thinking of anyone but yourself and youre incapable of taking responsibility for your actions and choices. From day one of your miracle pregnancy youve thought only of yourself and you use every single situation to dodge responsibility and cry woe is me look at how hard I try. Youre a disgusting person.  Shes a child not a creation meant solely to love you. Use your new puppy to get that worship complex of yours filled. I sincerely hate you with every fiber of my being. I do not waste my time wishing you ill but that is only because I refuse to let you occupy my thoughts and my life more than minimally required.

The man was released from prison after unintentional manslaughter beat up a severely developmentally delayed man who ended up dying from the beating and promptly busted the littlest ones mouth open when she was a toddler. He works at least albeit under the table and often leaves state thank god hes not around regularly. And she works minimal hours so that she doesnt have to pay more child support.

3635775,0,t3_31x16o,I disagree that your SO is harming matters by prompting SS to greet you.  Would your SO do the same thing if they walked in a classroom and his kid ignored the teacher?  Yup.  Would your SO do the same thing if SSs teeball coach was ignored by SS?  Yup.  If SS got on the bus and ignored the bus driver?  Yup.So hes  right to issue prompts to his child to be polite to an adult.  But because your SO doesnt follow through on it SS has been taught he can willfully disrespect you an adult in his home.  Thats hurting your feelings and not doing the kid any favors in the longrun.  Its lazy parenting by your SO.Talk to your SO about the issue and decide together as the adults in the home who make the house rules whether a child should be expected to issue a polite greeting to adults in the home.  The answer is yes.  This means that SO has to enforce it with his son.  Its a rule and if SS is ignoring it hes doing it to test boundaries.  Responsible parents do not let a boundary test go unchecked or they end up with entitled children.  Your SO might adjust his method a little bit and say SS you forgot to say good morning to StepGF! and give the kid the benefit of the doubt.  You laugh and giggle and say Im sure he just forgot!  Good morning SS!  This humorous approach that makes it seem less like a rule to be broken and more of a silly oversight by the child may combat the stubbornness.  gtSO feels like this would happen in any normal parenting situation even if we were both his bio parents.The difference is that youd be SSs mother and would therefore have the authority to do something if your child was being rude to you.  You do not have that power therefore your SO needs to be the one to stick up for you and insist that his child be respectful to you.  Go buy the book Stepmonster by Wednesday Martin and read it with your SO.  Your SO is the key to your happiness.  He has chosen you as his life partner and therefore it should matter to him that his children treat you with respect. SS doesnt have to like you he doesnt have to love you but he does need to respect you as an adult in his home.  If he doesnt SO needs to step in and stick up for you.  The book lays all of this out in easy to understand language and has helped many a clueless SO to officially remove his head from his behind.,stepparents,cq6pf6a,1,t5_2t08x

Ive lightly urged for a change in this but as time has gone by I dont think its really needed. Both sides are so accommodating that its working well for us though that could change in the future.It really depends on the BMor birth father and I think many step parents friend these people before knowing if theyre Facebook crazy and its awful for them.

3972729,0,t3_35yd9n,Thats seriously disturbing. She needs intervention from a counselor  both to address the reasons she feel so angry and also to make it clear that those kinds of threats are completely unacceptable. If you feel like you are in imminent risk I actually suggest that you remove yourself from the house OR remove the child from the home have her stay with a friend or a relative. If you leave it might send her the message that she has won and taken over the home again by kicking you out. Thats not helpful. She should be removed from both of her parents to consider if she actually wants to be part of your family. The first night will probably feel like a holiday but pretty quickly she will miss being in her own home with her own things. This will especially be the case if the person in charge of watching her doesnt do something stupid like take her to an amusement park or something. This is NOT special time reserved for a child who might be feeling left out. This is temporary separationbanishment.

4037172,0,t1_crfk47z,I get it that you dont understand why steps dosayact the way they do sometimes.There are some things you just cant begin to describe to someone in a way that theyll get it until they actually do it.  Like being a Marine or going through basic.  I can tell you all about how much it sucks to run in formation in July humidity roll around in sand and dirt getting chafed all over sore and bruised and sleep deprived constantly.  Until youve been there no way you can understand it.  That doesnt mean you cant respect the fact that I went through it even though you dont know what it was like personally.You dont understand why we do what we do.  The thing is you also dont realize the things we have to accept in our roles. The problem as I see it is you dont seem to care to understand that.  You just want to criticize us as a general population for the sins that a precious few deadbeats did to you.  This much I can tell you  Thats more on the crappy choices your parents made in their lives that impacted you directly.  In my situation as one quick example.  I am a step to a child whose father is in the picture and active.  They have a decent relationship but not without its issues.  I am the coach of his athletic teams his Dad is an assistant with me.  I take him to practices pick him up drop him off at the camps if my wife isnt doing it participate in parent meeting after parent meeting background checks because Im a coach CE training because Im the coach stay up late at night fixing the gear when it needs maintenance.  When it comes time to do the end of year stuff Dad gets recognized as the other parent rightfully so and I get the pat on the back for coaching.  In his other activities I get to stand politelyquietly in the background while Mom and Dad get the accolades for the parents.  Even though I am the one that helps him with the band practice because I am a musician Dad isnt I am the one that helps him with his wrestling technique I wrestled in HS Dad didnt.  What am I supposed to do be bitter about it because Mom and Dad are getting recognized?  What good would that do?  And even though I know that child better than any other adult outside of the two people Ive been referring to if his mother is out of town on business and I have to take him to the ER guess who is legally unable to sign anything for him to make sure he gets the necessary medical attention?  Guess who cant tell a school nurse yes he can take a tylenol when Ive given him tylenol countless times in the last  years?  Guess who has less legal rights than his bleeping math teacher depending on the circumstances?So understand why we at times can be bitter to the point of anger here or frustrated to the point of tears.Some of us may not get why youre so angry at your parents and stepparents but some of us really do.

The most we say about SSs mom is since SS goes to two houses we often have coordination issues making sure both parents are aware of field trips volunteer opportunities projects behavior homework etc... so what works best for you? Can we correspond by email so we stay in the loop on the days or weeks kid isnt with us? That is neutral doesnt bash mom and also makes it clear that you intend to be an active parent.

Just like a favorite babysitter or auntie the stepmom might hold a special place in their lives... but its not the same special place you hold.While the above is true I want to point out that I feel Im different than just a favorite babysitter or auntie.  I take care of my kids just as if I had given birth to them so to compare me to a favorite babysitter or auntie isnt giving the role of StepMom the credit it is due in my opinion.  Am I their mom? No not at all. Its a special bond and I get that but there can definitely be a bond that is with a stepmom that is more than favorite babysitter or auntie. Its a special bond of while these children arent my own biological children I take care of them daily. I love them and protect them I work hard to provide anything they need and a lot of their wants. Im a mom in every sense of the word besides being blood related to them. All of that said unfortunately I see a couple red flags. Posting about step parenting before shes even met the kids? Ugh thats the kind of kidentitled personality that gives all of us stepparents a bad name.Alright so shes probably excited about having step kids I dont see this as a super bad issue.  However it is childish to put that stuff on social media but Im not one that does a lot of social media anyways due to it being intrusive.    But her being excited about step kids is a good thing at least you know that shes not one to say Oh you have kids well lets send them to their moms and not deal with them.

My mom wanted nothing to do with the processes  just assumed that someone else would pick up the slack. Now that were older you can bet you know which parent we are invested in who we talk with every week who we make sure to see on holidays and bring by the kids skids who we ask for for advice or share good news etc. I think you have to take a deep breath and do whats best for your daughter as youve always done and know that you are creating a wonderful and priceless and special relationship.

Regardless of what may happen you are an adult and you chose to be there the child did not.Also stepparents who blame the child for being a bad kid because they cant bear to blame their precious spouse so they take it out on the one they dont love the kid. Yes many stepparents do not love their stepchildren this is well known.Finally stepparents who go on to have their own kids with their spouse and treat their kids better than their stepkids. You can pretend this isnt the case all you want but it is the case.I am beyond over this post and have no idea why you came and responded after all this time.

But yeah sometimes I wish we had more money for a babysitter or that we could trust her to be by herself in the evenings. She has behaviour issues and a shitty past due to her mother so I try to take that into account. Its hard but I guess I do find myself wishing she was more mature! Then again shes nearly  so Im going to hazard a guess that my feelings are shared by most parental units of tweens and teenagers. I think having my own kid would be more stressful actually and I could imagine wishing a time out. But considering my partner does most of the parenting in the household I have more freedom in that sense than if she were my bio kid. Does that make sense? If she hasnt done her room my partner deals with that. If she hasnt done her homework my partner deals with that too. She doesnt want my attention as much as he wants his so its always dddaaaaaddddddyyyyy. So I dont get the constant badgering either. So I guess I kind of have it easy at the moment?

4981436,0,t1_cumfwmg,I would suggest speaking to the mother about the kids staying with you and your SO full time and she get weekend visitations. It does sound like she pretty much wants to be a baby sitter mom from what youve described. While she may love her kids she doesnt want to really be a mother. If she doesnt agree to this I would still talk to a lawyer or mediator about you and SO having full custody! ,stepparents,cumg4de,2,t5_2t08x
4990392,0,t3_3j9ysi,You might edit to give ages of all involved amp how long youve been together. Inattentive parenting could be a red flag but perhaps an example would clarify what you mean. One persons inattentiveness might be another persons discipline technique refusal to acknowledge unwanted behavior for ex. In what ways do you help w the kids amp is there a situation in which you find her inattentive amp you have an alternate approach etc. Sorry to offer questions instead of advice.,stepparents,cunj0db,8,t5_2t08x
5081977,0,t3_3kliq3,gtShe flipped that he was wearing a pair of shortsI think this has nothing at all to do with the shorts.  I wouldnt be shocked to discover that shes having feelings about his first day of school and him being taken to school by your FH and all these feelings are not good feelings.  We went through this when our BM flipped shit about being reminded that I exist in some minuscule way and it turned out hours of ranting about everything else in existence later that she was upset that the kids didnt remember her birthday and we were supposed to do something about it though we didnt know it was her birthday either nor that she had these expectations.  Shes just a busted sewer main of bad feelings looking for something to stick to.  The shorts worked.  Money was better.  Getting his mom involved was even more validating.  Having some kind of conference chat will be her getting to be the host of the Me Show and get her feelings all over more things.

SS was grounded for a month due to a serious infraction at school. His Mom agreed to the same grounding on same terms at her house. It lasted about four days. This sucks soooo bad.But SS is learning over time that Dad is dependable Dad does what he says hell do and Dad is teaching me to do the right thing. Hes learning Mom isnt dependable she does whatever feels good at the moment and she doesnt even really care if I do the right thing.Just stick with the guidelines at your house. If you are consistent and do not bash Mom in the process for choosing to not be consistent the kid will learn a long slow lesson about which parent is going to be a better landing spot in hard times and in good times.,stepparents,cvswh5p,1,t5_2t08x

Stop worrying about things that arent your issues namely his new girlfriends and his relationship with his daughter.  These are HIS issues.  Let them be and get yourself out of this tangled financial mess with your ex.

5346245,0,t1_cvuyvri,gtThis is a concern of mine moving forward. BM has offered to help as much as she can but she is struggling financially so we dont ask for things. There is no child support or formal financial plan although there is a custody agreement. We are finally filing the divorce papers delayed due to changing custody and waiting for signatures etc and Im starting to worry it will cause issues. Did you have medical costs and such outlined in an agreement? Also it makes me hopeful that you were able to put the kids on your insurance! We are making it official once the divorce is done and I was worried about that. Sorry to run on here back to your post if I were in your position I would request she start to pay as well. You have done your best to keep her informed and up to date on matters and she hasnt shown the same in return so go by the book split costs and communicate only when needed as in only when your agreement states you must share info. Hopefully she will see how good she had it and come around? The custody agreement says all costs not covered by insurance are to be split  including copays and other expenses  no more than day after receiving the cost. Im going to be getting September medical bills and mailing them to her certified mail with a please pay by date. Im so over this crap. I had to send in my marriage certificate and the kids birth certificate and they are on my insurance as dependants. ,stepparents,cvv1k6g,1,t5_2t08x

He didnt drive an hour and a half to NOT get to see his daughter. It is dads time to do with what dad wants to do.

5823174,0,t3_3utns8,Hey there. It looks like this might be a throwaway for you but if you read this at some point know that youre not alone in dealing with a stepparent who had some major issues. Thats not how its supposed to work but like uaglet said its true there are good parents bad parents good steppparents and bad stepparents. There should be a subreddit for kids whove dealt with the issues youve had to face. Im honestly very sorry for what youve been through and I dont say that lightly because I had a stepmother who put me through hell. I could write a book but it sounds like you could as well.Because of my own experiences Im determined to do a better job than she did. The majority of people on this sub are stepparents who care very much about their stepchildren and have to wrestle with issues that people who arent raising other peoples children can even begin to relate to. The community is supportive and understanding. Quite frankly Id have been lost without it. Your stepmother sounds like she has some serious issues. Id suggest having a one on one with your father about how it makes you feel. Try to get to the heart of the matter and be willing to compromise. If that doesnt work at  youre an adult and you can choose who to spend time with or not. ,stepparents,cxixyox,3,t5_2t08x

BUt I really like this guy I see myself with him. And I dont think he moves too fast or too often. He had a divorce with his first baby mama and a few years later he just started hooking up with the second one on and off he told her he wasnt ready to start seeing anyone because of his divorce.And I guess I worded that wrong I didnt notice the pictures until after a few visit they were on the side of his fridge Im sorry.I can get that I dont get a stocking because I havent met the kids yet first Baby mama doesnt get one because they just dont like each other and their child knows that the second one gets one because Santa idk..lol. But shes going to be celebrating Christmas there.And Idk..I dont think they really had a real relationship until after the pregnancy and even after they would fight a lot he heard some bad things about her but just wanted to make things work just for their child but it didnt work and now theyre just being civil. ,stepparents,cxtpwjm,1,t5_2t08x
5984659,0,t3_3xex5f,I was feeling this way just a few weeks ago. Our situation is fairly similiar in that we were thrown into the full time mom role fairly fast. We have majority custody of my SS. I watch him during the week on my days off and after school until I go to work. His grandma watches him  afternoons a week so it helps but its only when Im at work anyway. I started to really resent our son cause he didnt appreciate me or the MANY things I do for him and had some poor manners. I finally withdrew and said I couldnt do it anymore. My boyfriend and I were fighting and it felt like me against my SO and stepson all the time because he would understandably defend his son. I lived on this sub and random parentingstep parenting blogs. I want a relationship with our son and I knew our not getting along was hard on my boyfriend. So my SO and his mother who is a stepmom herself both sat him down and talked to him about being grateful using his manners and explaining that Im going to be in his life for a very long time we are having a baby Im due in May. Ive been putting more effort into bonding and spending quality time with our son and I really think the combination of the two has helped tremendously. He asked me a few days ago if he could start calling me mom and thats something I honestly didnt expect to happen for a long time. We hace discussed family counseling for my boyfriend and I simply so we can communicate better and parentdiscipline better. So maybe try reading some parenting booksblogs pertaining to their age discuss family counseling and have dad sit down with everyone and really express what your place in the family is and how he expects the kids to treat you. I totally agree that time to yourself can be beneficial but dad needs to sit down with the kiddos and show you guys are a team and he expects the same respect and rule following with you that he would with himself.,stepparents,cy44c8x,3,t5_2t08x

The you have to respect me because Im an adult thing you mentioned in another answer doesnt work well Google for more on authoritative vs authoritarian parenting. Did you ever feel genuine respect for somebody as a kid just because they were an adult authority figure?If hes having so much trouble in school that expulsion is seriously being discussed he needs some major problemsolving. He needs help to find solutions and to be led to these solutions. Doesnt do his homework...well whats he interested in? What happens if his weekends involve going to a museum to learn more about whatever hes interested in? Thats a good way to get kids to be more serious about learning.gt  you simply cannot get through to himIt sounds like punishment just flat out doesnt work and punishment does not get through to him. Approach this more creatively. gt  How should I react when its just me and the boys and SS is deliberately disrespecting me and trying to piss me off?

6063251,0,t3_3ykym2,...I think you got quite reasonable advice in rrelationships. Your take on this is pretty bizarre your responses over there just underscored that you dont have a reasonable view on the situation and I can see why people think Bree has a sound reason to avoid you. I cant imagine why you would want to force yourself on another adult or why you think your husband should abandon his daughter because as somebody succinctly put it in rrelationships she doesnt like some random woman he married.I spent a while not speaking to my mother  not somebody who came into my life at  but my mother  and maintained contact with my father. His being reasonable and not taking sides did a lot to prevent that rift from turning into a permanent break  I still had a functioning tie to my parents we were able to pass on updates. Eventually enough time passed and we started talking again much better off for having taken a break rather than passing the time fighting with each other. You seem to be absolutely spoiling for a huge fight with your husband and your stepdaughter the sort of fight that results in permanent damage. Theres no reason this kid cant take a break from you for whatever reason she likes. It is nuts to ask your husband to cut off his kid because the two of you dont get along.

It was strange then as it is now but its not up to me to choose her attitude. My only concern is how the kiddos see us interact so I cheerfully greet her wish her a Merry Christmas introduce her whatever.My rule of thumb is this even if they dont understand now when The Tiny People are adults theyre going to look back and remember how the role models in their lives acted. Theyll see these situations and interactions with new more perceptive eyes. I never want them to remember a time I didnt try or that I took advantage of their youth and navet to sneak in being a jerk.

6129645,0,t1_cymaqbu,This is by far the most common response I get from people I tell this situation to. Youre young its not your responsibility to save Nick from his bad decisions he is old enough to have his act together you deserve better etc. I get more than enough of it from my mother on a daily basis trust me.I dont expect that Nick and I will ever have a perfect Sharonfree relationship. Ive come to terms with the fact that Sharon is always going to be around and annoying us even after Billy is of age and she cant legally use him against us anymore. But yes I definitely see what youre getting at and why youd discourage me having a relationship with Nick. Most of my family members have opened up to me about how they think I should leave Nick. Its a recurring discussion that happens between me and many people and so its always something thats on my mind and I understand that is still an option for me. But most people who have this response when I explain the situation and ask for advise they just cant understand why Im with Nick in the first place which I think is an important piece of information to consider when I think about leaving him. Even with all the stupid Sharon drama the benefits of being with Nick still outweigh the negatives for me. Sure that could still change if Sharon continues to be batshit crazy but thats why Im here asking for input so I can think ahead and see what else might be in store and consider if that is something I want to suffer through.,stepparents,cymdkxe,2,t5_2t08x

Im quick to jump to those conclusions so I was hoping there would be more beneficial situations out there.

She immediately criticized everything I did and tried to make our lives hell to get back at my SO for leaving her. I ended up cussing her out.

6390844,0,t3_42w305,I feel like theres something about that year mark thats especially brutal.  years is kind of a long time. Youre not a newcomer anymore. Most problems seem like they shouldve ironed themselves out by now. But instead right around  years for us was when things took a turn from unsteady but improving straight into shitstorm. And Im surprised at how often I hear the same thing from other steps. Anyway there are tons of problems here starting with a highconflict divorce. uCheesasaurus as always gave outstanding advice on that so Ill just step in here to add that its very normal for things in blended families to get worse before they get better. VERY NORMAL. That obviously does not make it any easier but just know that you are definitely not alone in wanting to go get milk and never come home. Ive been there and so has probably everyone in this sub at one time or another. The typical blended family takes on average something like  to  years to really gel. I can never decide whether it wouldve been better if Id known that number at the outset or if I wouldve  decided on the spot there was no way Id make it that long. Or longer Id say it took like  to  years for us to find our groove. None of this is encouraging I know. But youre at the beginning of the race and I think its important to know how far away that finish line is so you can pace yourself accordingly without burning out. Sanity starts with concrete boundaries. If your GF cant bring herself to set those then things will not improve. Never. The BD will never just magically come around and start being reasonable. He will never stop being this way. This is his personality. This will be your life forever unless she puts her foot down and stops letting him control and manipulate your lives.

6404164,0,t3_4342zw,I know some people might argue in favor of cosleeping because a lot of cultures do it not on this thread but usually when this argument comes up they fail to acknowledge two things. One a lot of them do it out of convenience or necessity and two the cosleeping arrangement is routine and not meant as a solution for kids who have trouble sleeping or are afraid. You should never continue allowing the child to sneak into bed in order to placate their difficulty sleeping its going to make it harder for them as they get older.Honestly because of puberty I think your stepchild is too old to share a bed with parentsstepparents. Its both because she needs the space and privacy and because she needs to learn how to manage her own uncomfortable feelings when she cant sleep. What happens when shes off at college or something and needs to be alone? Now is a great time to help her with it.My SS hadhas this same issue. He coslept in his BMs bed until he was about  and only stopped because she had another baby his halfbrother. He now sleeps in his own bed over there but same room with them both. So when he came over here even though he had his own room he kept asking to sleep with us. What I did was have SO start a nightly routine in which the last part of the night was him cuddling with SS in his bed watching a show on Netflix which later became a comic book. This was great bonding time for them and also helped SS practice his reading he was about  grades behind on reading when I first met him. It also helped foster his room and his bed as a place of safety and love even if Dad isnt always physically there. This has been a theme for us by the way. Weve each hugged him and told him we love him and so do his biomom  her family and that we know its hard to be physically apart but that we love him every single day always. Once SS had a fight with his dad and came crying to me I hugged him and said your dad loves you all the time forever whether you are happy with each other or mad and every day of the year and every year whether you are here or at your moms.I included that last bit because I think SSs desire to sleep in our beds was partially from that insecurity and partially the same transition fear that many kids have. Anyway SS no longer has difficulty sleeping along in his bed although were still working on the lights thing. Also hes invited me to the comic reading at night. Maybe you could try a ritual like that.Finally same boat no way in hell I would sleep an entire night with SS who is now  as he gets older especially. BM would go nuts especially since he has recently been calling me pretty and cute hes just parroting but she doesnt know that.,stepparents,czhl6s0,3,t5_2t08x

She pays all of kiddos private school tuition she pays the bulk of his summer camp expenses. She used to buy all of his clothing but we have started buying more of that for our house so there doesnt need to be any back and forth. My husband pays the doctor visit copayments when he takes kiddo to the doc which is probably  of the time.  Generally child support in a  situation is to equalize the situation for the child between the two homes but it can also be used to cover those other expenses that one parent typically ends up paying. ,stepparents,d02k2ad,3,t5_2t08x
6611255,0,t1_d02vori,Have you talked to your husband about all of this? In a lot of ways you should resent BM for the situation but DH also has put a ton of pressure on you to do this too. I hope he treats you like a queen for what youve taken on and he probably does I  you said you guys discussed it and made a plan for the best etc etc...but basically if Mom cant care for the kids its Dads responsibility not yours by default because youre a woman. I hope he appreciates what youve taken on. ,stepparents,d035r78,4,t5_2t08x

6806449,0,t3_48vupc,Wow. This is what Ive always wondered about my SOs ex. All of this. Perfectly written. Only difference is she sees her kids every third weekend and moved away from them when they were  and  to live with her new husband a man she had only met two months before hand. So she moves . hours away to live with him. They were married before he had even met her kids. Who gives up  custody for a MAN!?!?! he needed a green card in case you were wondering.  And yes she also rationalizes all her behavior. In her mind shes the best mom in the world never mind that lately shes cutting down her nexttonothing time with them to include even less overnights and cant be bothered to skype with them regularly  maybe twice a week if theyre lucky. I cant say why it bothers me so much  i dont understand her selfish behavior or how she could choose an almost stranger over the kids she carried and gave birth to but it doesnt bother me nearly as much as her rationalizations. Thinking shes such a great mom when she spends nearly all her money on herself and her new husband and new phones and new cars and new apartments and a trip to morocco and couldnt even get the  year old a birthday gift yet anyways. Supposedly it wasnt delivered on time. Tomorrow itll be a month and Im intrigued to see if she has it when she comes to see them. Maybe its because as you said it would be almost better for them if she just exited their lives completely. This halfin halfout makes things worse. ,stepparents,d0nt17h,1,t5_2t08x
6828327,0,t1_d0qa2ft,If hes an officer you are all set. Hes almost to that beautiful  perfect. Dont expect to love the kids right away that usually comes with time getting to know them as their own tiny people and becoming attached. Dont put too much pressure on yourself.

6832748,0,t3_494bo7,Depends on the family. My ex and I sit together we can pal around and joke. My SO pals around and jokes with him too and my ex brings his girlfriend sometimes so we probably look like some polygamous cult thing but whatever.My SOs ex would just as quick slit our throats as sit with us so its a nonissue. We do sit near her and that is for SSs comfort rather than hers. She would definitely do the come sit with ME and ignore dad thing otherwise so we remain in proximity to make it less awkward for the kid. There is a lot of conflict and anger coming from her so not even attempting to sit together is definitely the right decision.,stepparents,d0qsjv5,1,t5_2t08x
6870569,0,t3_49tweg,That sounds terrible Im so sorry. I would absolutely recommend printing off and giving your dad my husbands other wife by Emily Yoffe to read and hopefully your stepmom will read it as well. I will tell you that when you are a stepmom when you have your first baby there is sometimes an irrational fear that your child wont call your mom because your step kids dont. While this is no excuse for making you call her mom it may help you attribute a reason for it since it sounds like this really only picked up once your sibling was born. Since you have no pictures of your mom at your house I would start a journal and write down everything you remember about her. This will help you keep her close while you go through this. You can also try googling pictures of her. Obituaries are usually posted online with a photo so you should hopefully be able to find at least one. Or if she had a Facebook page it might still be there as well.I wish you lots of luck as you try and navigate through this.,stepparents,d0v39jl,4,t5_2t08x

6956232,0,t1_d13w6p9,I would agree. Please understand that I was upset and angry when I wrote this. I was venting my frustration. There is so much more than just her being in trouble and our obvious lack of involvement. We were actively involved with her and her activities school drill team and more early on in the relationship. I learned that I was too strict on some things and I made a conscious effort to work on that.  I did actually Google your suggestion a long time ago. I restructured the way I was talking to her and changed my attitude when she was having a rough time adjusting or having issues. Believe me I have tried to not be like my parents and understand that she is a child and is going to make mistakes. I dont want to fight or yell because it only makes things worse. However the things I changed were only helping to deal with surface issues minor behavior problems and typical kidteen stuff. What I didnt mention in this post was that no sooner did DH and I get engaged but BM stopped showing for visitation. I still have a MAJOR issue with this! Her absence only reinforced what my SD was concerned about and what I knew was the reason for her  at the wedding. I know that she thinks her BM stopped coming around because DH and I were getting married SD has told me this several times. I was shocked at the wedding with her being upset not because it wounded me but because we had spent so much time together before and had worked to have a happy relationship. SD and I were close when she was younger and I knew that this meant we were up against something bigger than the three of us could handle alone. BM made a conscious decision to stop seeing SD disappeared with no warning and made no effort to contact her for almost  years!! I cannot imagine doing this to a child. I am not blind to the fact that this is a massive problem for SD. It should have been addressed from the beginning. However MIL FIL and DH were more happy about the fact that BM was not around to try and instigate more trouble. What they saw as a blessing I saw as a red flag. My inlaws started out as being so supportive of our relationship which was a slap in the face when it actually came time to transition her into our home. The perspective I get from them is that they were the reason my DH won custody in court. So when we finally got her room ready and were ready to start moving her in my MIL told SD that she would be lonely without her there and eventually SD told her father that she did not want to move in with us. We all agreed not to rock the boat and if she was more comfortable at my inlaws we would not force her to move in with us. No change in school no moving away from friends and SD had  cool rooms to call home. We thought what we were doing was in her best interest. What I didnt know was that MIL was telling her all of this and making her feel guilty. It was a selfish power play. Again at this point we had not had any of the issues we have seen in the last several years. Even throughout this period we were still actively working with my inlaws to be involved around and united in raising her. We still visited her often took her out tried to spend quality time with her and even asked for her to come stay on weekends. Maybe I am wrong but I dont think my DH or I should have allowed her to behave in a nasty manner and get away with it in our home. I dont see the harm in being grounded from your phone for a week. Its not like we physically punished her or she was mistreated. However as soon as we took her back to my MILs house she was able to do as she pleased. AGAIN this was after we were told to discipline if she acted out and MIL wanted to know if she was getting into stuff she shouldnt. IF she came over and was grounded at my MILs house she was still grounded at ours. We tried to respect my inlaws and show that we were in support of each others rules. When SDs behavior really changed and acting out started DH and I presented my MIL with the idea of family therapy and counseling for SD. All of our attempts to help SD have been ignored. MIL believes that the school guidance counselor is sufficient and that we dont need therapy. I know we all the adults needed better tools and communication to deal with SD. Her BMs disappearance was a huge deal. My problem is that I know SD is hurting immensely but MIL amp FIL dont see that she is screaming for help. DH tried to fight for his child to get help but MIL amp FIL have primary guardianship. It is very discouraging. Any effort to try and make progress was met with We helped you get her and we are raising her. You dont have any say so in the matter. Check yourself we have legal paperwork. However as soon as SD is in trouble or something serious we get the phone call This is your kid your responsibility. You need to deal with her.. Our options have dwindled to nothing. I know it is too late now. It is just very disheartening. Maybe taking them to court to fight for her would have helped but I dont see the family surviving that either. I am not sure there is a win in this situation. It is a really shitty existence for her and I am fully aware. Personally MIL amp FIL can jump off a cliff. They did a shit job raising my DH amp BIL and they are doing an even shittier one raising SD.  All I can do know is hope that she will be able to see through all the crap and grow out of this. Hopefully she will become a productive adult and stop looking for someone to fill the void. ,stepparents,d14tmip,2,t5_2t08x

7022711,0,t1_d1bu2pf,Honestly we are just not  there yet in respect to marriage not for lack of want but rather trying to be practical where we can jump into marriage without making sure that legallyfinancially things will be OK for SD. Its in the works and long term that is what we want to do but us choosing marry should always remain our decision not his familys and should be done on our terms. The future inlaws have even gone so far as to tell us how they would love for him to propose to me so they can get it on camera. Mind you I do not claim any rights to SD or to be her legal guardian. What I do for her is essentially that of a step parent in all but legal name and I think it was rude and uncalled to be told I cant say that I am having a proud moment while parenting but then be told but you are doing a good job. A good job doing what? Oh thats right parenting. But its not OK to post these things not because that isnt the roll I fill in SDs life but because of the piece of paper we dont have.At this point I have chosen to be the bigger person and move on and not fight this battle as hard because there are more important areas to focus my energy.

7174272,0,t1_d1s6srv,gt In addition to the fact that more people with problems post than those with smooth sailing I think that in general women mothers do have a bigger problem with their exes getting new girlfriendswives than men have with their exes moving on. Stepmonster is a really good book for new stepmothers that touches on this issue. I very much agree.Ill start with a disclaimer Im going to generalize here simply to explain my thinking.  I dont mean to offend the many wonderful mature biomoms who post here.  I know the following isnt always the case and so I want to make that clear Im not saying this always happens.  These are just some trends that Ive noticed both personally with friends and in others posting for advice on forums.  That definitely doesnt mean Im getting the whole picture and I admit that.  Still there are noticeable patterns and those are the ones Im commenting about.I think its got something to do with traditional roles.  Women are nurturers and are taken care of by the man.  The man is there to support the family and put up with even the unhappiest of relationships because hes a father now.  When the family breaks up no matter who took the action to break it up hes bad for walking away.  The woman seems to always get the benefit of the doubt that walking away from her family must have been justified because shes a nurturer and would always put the kids first.  I am truly fascinated that the discussion regarding this question contains talk of deadbeat dads as if it is the only possible lens to view the situation.Then a new man enters the life of that single mom.  He is there to support her and her family.  Hes a hero.A new woman enters the life of the single father.  She is there to nurture and be taken care of by him. She might be younger than him. ltrecord screeches to a haltgtThat is NOT okay.  By wanting to care about kids that arent hers shes taking away the mothers importance!  By wanting to maintain her own life and not sacrifice to kids that arent hers shes being cold!  By not making every single decision in her household to be central to BMs comfort shes being uppity!  By wanting kids of her own or bringing in kids of her own shes removing resources from the only kids that matter!  And if shes younger than the BD that could happen! HOW DARE SHE?!I think that the ideas of taking away from importance of the outside bioparent wanting to maintain independence and wanting her home to be hers to run tend to be issues that are associated with women.  I dont see pressure toward stepdads or judgement toward stepdads that I see toward women.That and  women are catty bitches to one another in ways that men are not.  Usually when there is conflict between a stepdad and a biodad it seems to involve drugalcohol abuse or criminal histories.  I dont usually see the relational aggression to the degree that I see amongst two women.  That could just be a filter I have though since Im female and have a nutso BM to deal with. the fears that a new womanSM produce in both the BM and the culture at large tend to place her in a nowin from the start. TLDR Men  Bad unless theyre stepdads whove entered the life of a single mom.  Women  Good unless theyre stepmoms who have entered the life of a single dad.,stepparents,d1tnbw0,2,t5_2t08x
7230071,0,t1_d1z3vyu,gt What hes doing is NOT GOOD FOR HIS KID!! At all. At all.I wish he could see this. He thinks he is providing a safe space for the kid since she has been through some stuff with BM thats way too grown up for a yearold to deal with. He doesnt see that hes setting me up for years if I stay of feeling excluded. And judging from what he said in a conversation last night he would rather have that than have to explain to his kid that Im going to be sleeping in his bed end of story and put up with a little sulking. FFS its not like she cant come into the bedroom in the mornings or if she has an actual nightmare.His parents did not model a healthy relationship for him. His dad had some problems with alcohol which led to all kinds of problems fights and longterm resentment. They are still together but almost every week theres a big blowout where one of them threatens to sell the house and pick up and leave for their home country. Hes probably trying not to have his daughter experience the kind of push and pull that he was forced into growing up and now but hes swinging too far the other way.gtTheres a huge distance between being cold to ones child and failing to prepare them to develop and become welladjusted.

7353221,0,t3_4fp2z7,Dont worry about what might happen with SD in the future.  Its doing you no good in the right now.  If BD and SD disagree often some space may be necessary.  Its unsettling that she also often seems to fight with mum and then mum shuts down?  I think its ok to let SD know that its not ok to yell all the time and youwife are happy to listen but could she please take a deep breath and try to talk rather then yell at you? and youwife work on not yelling at each other or the kids as much as possible  model the good behaviour to discourage the unwanted behaviour  Family therapy and individual therapy for each parent and for SD.  Mortgage the house if you have to.  An investment now with some maintenance down the line will do you and your wife and your children a WORLD of good if you can reset the way you all interact.   There is a TON of emotion in any household  even ones where there is no divorce.  Having conflict is unsettling for the whole household.  The individual therapy can give each of you tools to work with and the family therapy can bring you together to work out a plan or to try to resolve issues.   I also suggest you and your wife try to find positive interactions with each kid  seek out and acknowledge the good behaviours even the smallest little slivers of good behaviours   thank them for helping out with chores for pet care for being patient with the younger siblings for playing nicely with each other for doing well on school work for trying hard in school work for getting their teeth brushed that they look nice that you liked that book in school or you loved grade  geography you like that new song for rinsing their dish for helping their sister find her socks etc etc etc  LOOK FOR THE GOOD and you will start to SEE MORE GOOD.  It resets how you will all interact its like a breath of fresh air.  Try to find a positive a way to acknowledge each kid and their value every day multiple times a day at all possible!If things get heated and they will! You are raising teenagers! take a deep breath  a comically large deep breath and hold it. And release it as slow as you can. And in your head think if this issue will matter in  minutes an hour a day  days a month a year.  And pick which battles are worth fighting.  And if maybe someone is projecting their frustrations and being snippy?  VALIDATE their feeling and try to find a solution and redirect. I am listening. I hear you are upset with BD. I understand that this is really challenging for you.  I know it upsets you when you and BD dont get along.  How would you prefer him to respond?  What do you think you could change about this?  How can I help you?  You could let her know how you are feeling about the situation and validate if she is feeling shitty or awful or sad about something and then find a positive outlet for her feelings.    Get some colouring books  for real  keep them on the kitchen table with crayons.  Sit down with a coffee while the kids are doing homework and colour a bit.  Gives you a chance to listen to the kids while everyone is involved in an activity  its called passive listening I learn a lot about my kids day and its easier for them to talk about the hard stuff of the day rather then sitting face to face.  Its also hella relaxing for adults and kids.  Just buy one per person or print off some pages online and leave them in a basket on the table. Aim to colour for  minutes a day while the kids are at the table or nearby or whatever.  Do it for you to relax and hopefully you can be a part of some of the kid conversations. Keep it positive and its ok to ignore slight indiscretions. They wont become axe murdering sociopaths because they said one cross word to their sibling or they didnt put their dishes in the dishwasher.  Try to let some of the negative stuff go just think about the grand scheme and pretend you didnt hear some of it at least for right now while things are heated just try not to sweat the small stuff!.  Get SD to work on a project with mum  a planter of cheap flowers at the front door and dont get cross if they die  sometimes they do even if you water them enough or a craftphoto album for grandma or a volunteering project or a charity K  give mom and SD a chance to have some positive one and one and look for opportunities for each parent to have  on  with each kid  tough I know when you have a crowd!

You have to be the one to really think about them and decide thatI really recommend reading How to talk so kids will listen and Listen so kids will talk by Elaine Mazlish and Adele Faber. It might help you communicate with them better. And definitely let the kids start doing things for themselves. Your goal and your SOs should be to raise children into adults that can take care of themselves in the real world. That means letting them make their own breakfastlunches or letting them eat school lunch. Let them make the choice. I just had to have a talk with my BFs kids about how everyone in the house needs to respect each other and I was tired of them whining about how they dont want to do homework or they dont want to do their chores putting away dishesclothes etc. Having bad attitudes made it miserable for everyone in the house.

7469813,0,t1_d2r2v1a,Mom is very concerned and is trying to be proactive so she is already lining up therapy even before her insurance goes in to effect. She is very anxious obviously. She has been somewhat inconsistent because on one hand she allowed her son to do things like force her to pause conversations when he was there because he didnt want me to see him but has since gone out of his way to make sure to go where she is when were talking. So to a degree she gave in to him on something that may have seemed reasonable but the result has been his using that to control her.She has also really had a hard time accepting that she herself was emotionally abused. I wont give details because that is not my place but I can tell you their relationship had been abusive since high school and I actually was a witness to emotional abuse of her in the presence of the kids. But I understand because I came from an abusive home and I know that denial by the victim is very common. So while she is upset that her son has done everything in response to BDs actions and his behavior is always dramatically worse when he comes back to actually admit hes being abusive and manipulative is hard for her. I feel horrible for their son. I know what he was told and I do come from a background where my mother practiced parental alienation both against my BD who was himself an abuser and even against my SD. I also saw as my step brothers were manipulated by their mother and to this day my younger stepbrother believes events happened that not only didnt his memories are actually impossible based on who had custody at the time.I am not looking for help for me to feel better but resources and advice on helping mom and son. And I understand the advice to back away but I also know that every single therapist I have read so far says that when a child has started to be emotionally manipulative the worst thing you can do is give in because then they will become manipulative in general. And really the situation now is no longer that my presence is causing her son stress. In fact that is not his complaint at all. He is essentially trying to make his mother hurt and is blaming her that his father is in pain. His actions are when he acts out quite cruel. I worry about how he will feel later in life if this sint stopped.At the same time he does have periods where he is remorseful for having hurt his mother so I know he does care. And I know that much of this is both the normal pain of parents divorcing and that there are clear signs that BD is practicing Parental Alienation on both kids but hes having more success with his son.I dont expect an easy road. I dont expect some miracle cure. As his mother and I spoke this morning after shed found a counselor I said I would imagine he will be slow to open up will likely continue to both cover for his father and to dramatize some things his father has said and it may take a while before he has enough comfort to open up. At the same time he has a great heart and you can physically see when he is actually upset when he is parroting his father and when he is allowing himself to be happy almost like a switch is flipped. There are certain times particularly when he is expressing his belief that his father will be physically violent towards me that his voice even changes and his speech patterns mimic BD.The one thing happening now that may start alleviating the pressure is that BD has apparently got a girlfriend now. My fiancee does not ask about her but the kids did mention her. BD has also recently traveled a few places as well so perhaps this will affect his mood and behavior and ease the pressure on the kids. ,stepparents,d2r9t90,1,t5_2t08x

He now has a group that he spends time with. I dont have any friends outside of my mom sisters and coworkers.

8011926,0,t1_d4gl5oz,Yeah.  SO has said to me out of the blue that he just couldnt date a woman his own age.  He referred to them as jaded.  I dont like to ask questions about his prior dating so Im not sure what he meant and how hard he tried to meet them.  Its probably along the same lines of what you experienced.Hes the second divorced guy with kids Ive dated the first was very short term and both seemed to be happy go lucky guys.  Perhaps thats my preference in partners though.  SO could definitely be bitter toward BM for her emotional affair that ended their marriage but I think he was just incredibly thankful it was over and that he wasnt left with the guilt of ending it.  Even though she ended things he doesnt blame her for where he is today.  He took ownership of his life and is making it into the life he wants to live.  I honestly think its the general culture of female entitlement.  I know that many moms including your wife manage to avoid this train of thought but I see so many who act like the world owes them something because they had a kid.  I know BM definitely feels that SO and the world continue to owe her something.  And I just dont get it.  If youre unhappy then take a good hard look at yourself and your life and improve what you need to improve to get the life that you want.  Stop acting like you should just be handed something because you used your reproductive organs.Im trying hard not to let BMs hostile antics turn me into a bitter person.

It serves as a constant reminder to steps what our role is when a child acts like a mini ex. Mostly the only reason I want my own kids is so I can raise them how I want into awesome people. After a certain age you just dont have the influence on a childs personality that youd like. But this doesnt mean you wont have any influence. You dont have to change her or undermine her mothers influence but you can give her your own. Encorage the habits and ways of thinking you want and it will stick. While it sucks that she bears the traits her mom has given her thats not who she is. Teach her to be a better person the way you know how and try to see what shes learned from you not inheirted from her mom.,stepparents,d5k6sf7,2,t5_2t08x

8405559,0,t3_4uonwc,Ive never wanted bio children but I wasnt necessarily opposed to dating a man with children. Im in the fairly unique position of having dated my DH before he had children and then reuniting several years later. In his case becoming a father changed him for the better. Im fortunate too that although our first relationship was completely unsuccessful I was able to have several years of being young and wild together. Ive had some issues with BM recently and of course I could do without that drama but Im actually really happy being a stepmother. Dont get me wrong. Its hard  really hard but I would absolutely do it all over again. Weve been living together as a family for four years married for almost one. The first year was very difficult for me. It was a huge adjustment to go from being single and carefree to helping raise  little girls. Id lived alone and done my own thing for so many years it was a huge adjustment to suddenly live with a family. During the days they were with us I was tense and uncomfortable. I wasnt used to being surrounded by people in my own home and I just couldnt relax. It didnt help that I felt so much pressure to be perfect. It was exhausting and isolating and I breathed a sigh of relief when the went back to their moms. So many times I fantasized about going back to my single life.  Fortunately I had good friends who encouraged me to stick it out. After that first year it got so much better. I started adjusting to my new circumstances and actually began to enjoy it as we started becoming a more cohesive unit. A love and a bond developed between myself and the girls and as that relationship with them actually brought my DH and I even closer. Were a family now and that gives me so much joy. I never wouldve imagined I would feel so fulfilled by family life. Im not their mom and Im fine with that but I love them and they love me and thats enough for me. That said I absolutely would not have gotten into this relationship at . Even at only  custody a great deal of my time effort and money is invested in them. The days of doing what I want when I want are pretty much over. I could not do this without resentment and bitterness if I hadnt had all of my s to be wild and carefree. To have fun and live for myself. I know several bio parents who feel like they missed out by marrying andor having kids too young.  Being a stepmother can be rewarding and fulfilling BUT it can also be heartbreaking and very lonely and isolating. Only you know whats best for you but based on the info youve given us I think you should pass on this relationship. At the least read through this sub and hear the challenges that other stepmothers have faced.Whatever choice you make I wish you well ,stepparents,d5s8nvd,2,t5_2t08x

8711301,0,t1_d6ttxdq,Oh.....its typical bitter exwife stuff.We split up because I was kinda depressed.  In hindsight that was because we were pursuing some of my exs lifegoals that I didnt particularly enjoy....so I wasnt happy....so I wasnt a great partner.  Remove her from the equation and I choose to live my life differently chasing my life goals and doing things that make me happy.  She chose to chase her life goals like the gym thing fullthrottle after we split up because I wasnt holding her back anymore.  But shes finding that the gym isnt as rewarding as she thought it would be duh! she cant find any men who are interested in walking that path with her duh! so shes left with a lot of time alone or hanging out with similarly unhappy ish white women.  And theyre all buried in their daughters gymnastics career while meanwhile being terrified that their daughters will be into boys and cars in a few years and then theyll just be  year old moms with no kids to mother anymore and a husband who is more of a roommate.  Meanwhile Ive built a new life with a new woman who Im actually compatible with and where we make each other happy.  It probably doesnt help that my wife is younger taller and blonder either.  And if also doesnt help that my daughter actually likes her stepmom not as a mom replacement but as a adult woman in her life.  Honestly the whole thing has just left my ex kinda emotionally broken because so many things she was so sure about havent worked out the way she anticipated.  And I have sympathy for her at a basic human level.  Its sad....and shes still my daughters mom and I wish she was setting a better emotional example for my kid.  I also wish shes be happier so shed quit worrying about me.  ,stepparents,d6ujrr3,2,t5_2t08x

Bend over backwards to see that she had things that were needed or not. And all I got back was crap. I remember once driving her to the father  dauther dance the BF was to busy  lazy to pick her up and waiting in the car for a few hours while they did their thing. I finally had enough and stopped. I told my wife how I felt and simply told her that I would not be doing anything extra any longer. That was roughly  years ago. The SDs attitude hasnt changed so my attitude hasnt changed. The strange thing is the SD was under the impression that my wife could simply make me do things for her. I have have pretty much been stress free since doing this. Also the wife has to deal with what the SD does and have since noticed a lot more of the bull that goes on and has stepped up to the plate a bit more to address issues. ,stepparents,d7xn0q5,15,t5_2t08x

9166289,0,t3_55nt2i,I like to put together projects that my SKs and I can do together especially if the result is something sweet for their dad or other family. Creating something together makes us a team and creating something for him makes us all feel good including Dad. Hes not usually the one that gets pampered. A project gives us a goal which helps keep them better focused and a tangible deliverable which is rewarding.On Fathers day we did a project where we poured a Lego mold with silicone then created gummy candy from the mold. When their grandparents came to visit from far away we created a banner that said Welcome Granny amp Pop! On special occasions we find pictures on the internet that I print out and they color in to make cards for people. Or sometimes we make banana bread or cookies together.Having multiple independent steps helps with attention span and sometimes they take turns helping.We also do the house rules technique but I have never had to worry about discipline. They are consistently well behaved as long as their dad isnt around. They know the bedtime and screentime routines we actually have the house policies printed out and posted.

Lately both kids have taken to introducing or referring to my parents as their grandparents though they call them by their first names.

9554050,0,t3_5bnyyl,Ive been a stepmom since my kid was .  Her mom and my husband have joint custody and alternate holidays.  The moment that she seemed to really realize or at least verbalize her upset over having two families was when she was about .  Hurt like hell to hear her tell me that she wished her mom and dad were still together.  I told her I understood its nice to have a mom and dad together but then her daddy and I wouldnt be together and Id really miss them.  She said shed miss me too.  Then told me that I could still live with them.Shes  now and if it comes up at all its to complain about having two houses to lose her backpack in.  She tends to come to me with questions about her parents because AIm honest and B I dont make her feel uncomfortable for wanting to know stuff.  The most recent question really got to me though.  She wanted to know why her mom and dad split.  As her mom slept around I didnt really want to go into details and make her think less of her so I just said that it wasnt my story to tell.  That I could tell her that they were both happier apart that they both loved her and if she wanted more details shed have to ask her mom or dad.  She never did ask them about it.   I then asked if she still wished her mom and dad were together and I loved her response.  She told me that yes in an abstract kind of way.  She wishes she had one house one family and not the back and forth but that she couldnt see them together and her dad and I were too right to split up.I guess what all my rambling is trying to say is really you just have to be there and to listen.  Itll help them to cope and it will strengthen your own bond with them.  I like the idea of the Skype call too.  D,stepparents,d9qqffk,7,t5_2t08x

9575701,1,t3_5c3s15,I took it a step further and physically removed any item Id ever gotten for SS from his room. Bagged it all up and stashed it away somewhere other than in the house. He came home to not even having a comforter because I am the one who helped decorate his room and bought the damn thing. Boy was that a hell of a wakeup call for him.It was really strained and awkward for about a month. I told him he could slowly earn his own items back by treating me with respect and doing what hes asked and such. So his choice was either to learn to respect me and in doing so realize exactly how much hed benefited from having me in his life or to not respect and still hed realize how much hed benefited from me being kind to him.Luckily he chose the latter path and I did return one item per day when he was decent to me. But he quickly just stopped asking to get items back and seemed to just finally get that he needed to respect me and that I do a lot of good in his life. So eventually the two bags of shit that he never even asked for I got rid of it. I think it also shows how much crap he had. Too much stuff.,stepparents,d9tefp5,5,t5_2t08x
9595426,0,t3_5cea2d,Im not an expert since I just joined the family in January but Ive been dating SO since  and spent weekends and went on trips with them.  Skids were  and  when he and I met and now they are  and .Ive definitely seen them go through stages and treating me differently.  But we never had the young child bonding time so its not an actual loss for me outside of a loss of potential.They absolutely treat their dad differently over time.  Remember that tweenteen years are when children start separating from their parents and leaning toward independence.  I often have to remind SO of this because hell say things like They dont want to hang out with me anymore and Ill say Did you want to hang out with your parents when you were a teenager?  I think he takes it far too personally.In fact I can remember the exact moment there was a shift.  We went to the homecoming football game at their high school and because we knew the kids would want to split up and hang out with their friends we started discussing where wed meet up after the game.  As we were talking we were walking closer to where groups of kids were and all of a sudden they were like Okay.  Whatever.  Can we stop talking?  SO and I were shocked.  That was the moment it occurred to us that it was not cool to be seen with us which threw us for a loop since we both tend to look and act pretty young for our ages.  I sat there during the football game thinking This is so unfair.  Im not even a parent.  I cant be uncool.  But I am.  Im now alright with it.,stepparents,d9vtz0p,11,t5_2t08x
9620081,0,t3_5crjj0,gtHeck her previous therapist begged me to stop forcing her to go because by teaching her her feelings dont matter and that I was setting her up for a lifetime of abusive relationships.Thats a little overdramatic.  Geez.gtHis girlfriend wrote me an email this morning telling me I need to get over my hurt feelings and realize how important having a father is to a girls life and how he helps them feel safe competent and lovable. My favorite though is when she refers to me as having no emotional intelligence.WUT.  Why in the hell is she writing to you?  Block her.  Dont respond and block her.gtDad and I generally stick to nocontact but he reached out the other day asking if I knew why daughter didnt want to see him. I forwarded him my journal entry from the last time she saw him and he accused me of making it up. Too much interaction.  If the kids are old enough to decide whether or not to spend time with dad theyre also old enough for him to speak directly with them.Youre not helping your cause that this is the kids decision by responding with your interpretation of their time with him.  That puts you in the middle and  heres something that you dont want to hear  you dont know for a fact that things are as bad as they tell you.  Im certain that theyre good kids and Im certain that youre a good mom but they know that their father left you and is now broadcasting his happiness with his girlfriend.  They know that has to sting.  So they may be embellishing to spare your feelings.  Just remember that.  Im sure some of what they tell you happens but probably not all of it.  Im not saying they lie.  I am saying that they know you want to hear bad things because they feel like it helps you feel a little bit better.Continue documenting but just remember to look at what they tell you with a grain of salt.  Theyre trying to be good kids who protect your feelings but you cant encourage that.  The kids shouldnt be worrying about you and how you feel.  Thats flipflopping the parentchild dynamic so try and free your kids up to have loving relationships with both parents.  It truly takes nothing away from you.  Hes always going to be their dad.  It might take them until theyre young adults to realize that when dad left he didnt leave them.  gtHe wrote me again asking if I ever noticed that his relationship with the kids deteriorates whenever he and I are fighting about something implying that I turned them against him. As you can tell hes implying that youre turning them against him because youre angry with him.  Whats more of a possibility is that they pick up on any frustration and anger that you may be feeling and take up your cause.  This is probably whats happening and its no ones fault.  With that said it is best for the kids to have relationships with both parents.  Id just talk to your kids about how their dad isnt perfect and hes a human being like everyone else.  But he does love them even though he screws up sometimes.  Try to let them know that its not a betrayal of you to go see their dad and have fun with him.  And if things get better and you feel brave enough tell them that youre not threatened if they like dads gf because you know love isnt a finite resource and youll always be their mom.  Essentially give them permission to stop fighting the adults battle.  They may not take you up on that but thats okay.  As long as youre freeing them up theyll remember that.gtI replied with this quote from my visitation journal after our most recent blowup Son walked in from dinner with dad last night looking positively shellshocked. He said he hadnt even gotten in the car yet when dad laid into him.I would stop replying with journals for the reasons I covered above.  Say Im sorry to hear that.  Please talk directly to him about it.And wait whose most recent blowup?  You and their dad?  Listen I understand that emotions are high but I think the place that you want to get to in life is free from your ex and living a life that is yours.  You can do parenting communication and move on with your life.  I think thats what you should strive for.  And anything that involves high emotions is keeping you tied to him.  Theres a great book for divorced women called Leaving him behind.  Conflict is keeping you tied and for your sake its time to stop finding reasons for it.  You should find a way to have unemotional businesslike conversation with your ex as infrequently as necessary.  Dont take the bait if he tries to start up an argument.gtI know there is nothing I can do to change dads worldview and get him to turn his attention back on himself but just wondering if anyone has any insight.Yes.  You cant control dad as you already know.  You can control you and the way you react to dad.  A few modifications should stop this dynamic from continuing or evolving.  I suggest the modifications because youre the one here asking for advice.  My focus on things that you can do is not to imply that you are at fault.  Just that there are some things going on that are under your control.  ,stepparents,d9yvfr1,11,t5_2t08x

I am listening to my gut and my gut tells me this person is not well.gtDid Mr. Unhinged escalate because you took less than the maximum action and he read that as weakness that was put to rest now that hes gotten the shock of being charged? Its possible he read it as weakness.  I dont think he knows hes been charged yet.  gtOr is each cop visit just going to be your part in an escalating back and forth that would die down if you got some space from each other? I dont know.  I dont know what the right thing to do was.  I spoke with a few people about what to do and we spoke to the cop who may be biased and everyone told us to charge him and show him we arent fucking around.gtIf BM or SD keep winding him up would you ever get that space?We know SD isnt winding him up.  Shes been happier and more participatory in our house since the first incident so in a way it was good in that it got some issues out on the table that needed to be addressed.  That seems to have allowed her to relax.BM is definitely winding him up.  Its the only thing shes got left.She just cannot leave us alone.  Its constant.  And sadly Ive realized that I cant seem to be with SO without feeling like our home is under siege.  Back when we lived in the same neighborhood she was constantly dropping by or walking her dog by.  Thats one of the main reasons we moved  to get away from her.  Now this.gtWhat is important is that you and your SO discuss a plan of action calmly and dispationately communicate it to your SD and both adults stick to it.Yes were going to wait to hear from the other officer who handled the original incident and then tell SD about it.  We both want to talk to the kids to find out if this guy is acting crazy around them too.gtAnd if you get a gun lock it up and dont get it out of the safe unless you intend to shoot him.

9864630,0,t3_5gkrl6,Thats such a bummer. It sounds like you guys were pretty close. Since youre nearly an adult now and you dont hold ill will towards her she might really appreciate you reaching out to her.I divorced my ex when my stepkids were around  and it was very awkward for me at first. I still loved and cared for the kids but I had no idea what their father had said to them and I was completely unsure of whether it was appropriate or healthy for me to reach out to them. I would always get updates on them when I could and I would always make a point to visit my exSD when she was up seeing her father my ex and she would actually come and spend part of her visit with me and my family which was so awesome. I still wasnt sure about the eldest two however.About a year and a half ago the ice kind of thawed if you will and we all got back in touch. As it turns out they missed and cared about me as much as I had them but no one knew how to take that first step in maintaining contact. Now I speak to them all on a regular basis and its wonderful.Your stepmom would probably love to know that you want to remain in touch with her. And Im sure she wasnt annoyed by her behavior.

Yes the child is getting to the age where he can remember that he does laundry Sunday mornings to go to Moms on Sunday night or whatever. But its still up to the adult in the household to facilitate that. Imagine the stress your child is feeling if he tells Dad mom says why is there a problem with me not being ready and Dad says any version of well tell your Mom that I dont much care for what she thinkswe have plans that dont involve herher attitude sucksIll have you ready when I damn well feel like it... whatever his response would be your child is then stuck in the middle. He feels like both parents are snarking at him when they are actually snarking through him at each other.When a kid has a job with a work schedule maybe a car.. basically a smidge of independence and control over where they go and how they get there then it may be acceptable to discuss plans directly with them.

10227272,0,t1_dbgy8ar,Were in couples counselling for us to learn how to better deal with my emotions over our family dynamic and how he can better support me. I came from being a single twentysomething to being a full time mom and it hasnt been the easiest transition  something you obviously know a lot about as well. Anyway one of the things the counsellor wanted us to do was make an effort to eat dinner together every night like a typical family and do something as a family on the weekends. Now that Christmas is over I guess well be jumping into those suggestions and see how it works out. DH also had some individual therpay in order to deal with all the things you mention about him. Trying to cover for his ex has only ever hurt the kids and they do know exactly what kind of mother they have. Hes getting better. Really its a lot better than when we first started dating. And miles away better than we they all first moved to Canada to live with me. But obviously we havent ironed out all the wrinkles quite yet. SD ended up going alone but NYE wasnt terrible. SS worked and had his GF over and he was in a good mood the whole week his sister was gone. DH didnt want to cancel plans hed already agreed to with BM  blah blah keeping his word blah blah. Whatever. But I told him how I felt about it in person and said it was not right to split the kids up for visitation. A couple days after SD got back I heard him ask SS if he could book a weekend off of work next month so that he could go with SD to see BM. So I think DH got the point and is already trying to orchestrate fair treatment for the next time around.

What school breaks?And most importantly who pays for her transportation?  Hint the two of you are in a power position right now because you could stop this move if you wanted to.  So BM is the one who is changing things and thus BM should be footing the bill for the consequences of this change.  Theres now long distance travel involved which is expensive.  Thats not because of choices youve made.  Start doing your research about points of conflict that other people have experienced when one parent moves a child away and get a legal agreement that prevents those problems from developing.  Now is the time to do that not after she moves.  You lose your power after she moves.,stepparents,dchzcuq,5,t5_2t08x
10374192,0,t1_dcjmbg4,Yes and if those kids are thinking that its because the parents andor parental figures modeled that behavior. Also the ending of the SO relationship is not going to be as traumatic on the kids as the original relationship breakup was.  Part of the reason is that just an SO thing I mentioned earlier and the modeling of the relationships arent forever that the biological parents have been modeling.  The kids have been raised in an environment where theyre taught relationships are disposable.  So they bond less and less with each successive SO as a defense mechanism.  Nobody wants to get hurt after all.  Unfortunately however it sets the kids up for failure later in life because theyre already in the mindset that relationships arent meant to be long term.  They dont learn healthy relationship communication skills most of the time they dont have a model for that growing up either instead they learn when the going gets tough blame it on your partner and dump them which just passes the issue down to another generation.  Its a sad cycle to watch.,stepparents,dcjz6xa,2,t5_2t08x

I think she really lost a lot of herself when he died and desperately needed time to find her way again. She felt her kids would suffer too much by being with a broken mother so she dived into work in order to secure her kids future. I understand that but I also understand that sometimes best intentions dont always lead to the best outcomes. As far as my role I really thought I could be a guide for these boys. I have extensive postsecondary academics experience and can help them navigate the complexities of a college education saving them a lot of hassle and heartache in the future. I believe even with the fullride scholarship track these kids are on theyll throw it all away by attacking someone or committing some crime out of anger. Possibly myself.

I am by no means a slob but BM apparently when she wants to be is a cleaning demon and has very high if sometimes theoretical standards for some things. Couple of examples I find her house to stink horribly of the dogs that dont go outside often enough also the dirty dishes are constantly piled up as no one cleans as they go also theres a semipermanent pile of junk in the driveway. BUT when they do clean they get down there and deepclean and take off every single spot. Like theyll clean one corner of the bathroom and get it absolutely perfect even though theyll be yelling and fighting the whole time. So even though my home imo is actually more pleasing and more ordered than hers overall still I feel some pressure to go scrub a random thing when the SKs are coming over.

This is also our goto discipline for anything that is new or unexpected that either of us can enforce with total backing from the other. Then when SD isnt around we discuss what we think is appropriate both big on consequences relating to infraction then sit her down and calmly discuss why something was inappropriate what we expect going forward and that a first offense is generally marked as a mistake but repeats will be treated as choices. Overall it works great for all involved but a few things to keep in mind even if I slip and give a consequence before talking to her mom...she backs me when there is a conflict in what is appropriate we generally defer the call to biological parent and we dont discuss anything in front of kids or while still upset. All of the above also applies to my yo in regards to her. Obviously the consequences are different but nothing with batteries or a screen will screw up a  year olds day pretty badly too!!!,stepparents,dcm2u80,2,t5_2t08x

Its not like hes had a whole lot of life since birth to go by.  And its actually awesome to get this confusion out of the way early although he probably isnt confused.  But now hes being exposed to non monogamy and thats good in case he wants that for himself later on.  HE doesnt know it was unethical and he shouldnt ever unless you or mom screw up royally.  He might figure it out later if he remembers at what age stepdad entered his life if hes still around whch is iffy but thats moms problem for introducing him romantically to kid this soon.

Not with the drugs or the absent BM or anything but FH refused to acknowledge me to his ex for the first  months of our relationship even though it was so obvious we were together. And it caused huge issues in the long run.Also it sounds like there is no custody agreement or child support.

10768444,0,t3_5u12dw,Since hes in counseling already Id suggest he talk about this there. Tell him youre concerned about his reaction and that there is clearly something triggering these reactions for him. Tell him youd like to be equally excited about a baby and not run into unresolved issues along the way.It does suck that hes gotten to do the baby thing before and you have to be sympathetic and considerate of him when in reality this is a totally newscaryexciting experience that he should be supporting you emotionally not the other way around. What hes doing is clouding an experience that is already less than perfect due to circumstances. You do deserve to be special. You deserve all of the comfort and support as someone in a first family. sigh its a tiresome perception that stepmoms have to always be strong everyone else gets a pass to be moody or play the victim. His reaction is really something he should apologize to you for and work out on his own. I would also suggest he think about fairness with future children and fairness does not always mean equality. Younger siblings often have betterdifferent opportunities because parents are later in their careers and make more money. For example I ate lots of tuna casserole as a kid and by the time my brother was around we had steak. We were an intact family but would it have been fair to make my brother eat tuna casserole just to make it even? Is it fair to not name your child something just because your SO hadnt thought of it? Issues of fairness will likely come up in other ways and this is something he needs to begin thinking about now.You say hes very in touch with his feelings. Sometimes that can result in not being very in touch with others feelings just your perceptionprojection of what you think their feelings are. Introspection can also lead to depression.,stepparents,ddqoofp,9,t5_2t08x

He is responsible for his own feelings yours as his partner and his children.  She will get over it.

10817323,0,t1_ddvolcw,Its not being trivialized its just the reality. Different does not mean worse necessarily but...LDRs are intense and often get serious too quickly because people have are in vacation mode when they do see each other in person and have the whole star crossed lovers who cant be togetherRomeo and Juliet thing going on which causes a lot of people to mistake the extended honeymoon period of an LDR with something more real and intensifies feelingsTypically the only way to close the gap means someone needs to make sacrifices and move which can cause resentment but also means many wont discover incompatibilities until they have spent money and completely changed their life and have a lot invested in the relationship succeeding and therefore are more likely to stay in an unsuitable relationship due to the sunk cost fallacy Nobody is trying to be mean or trivialize its just that many of us have been around the block more than once and are outsiders and are able to separate emotion from realityMaybe it will work and maybe not wont but taking things slow and making sure you do things with the kids and long term success in mind can only be a a positive thing and rushing and moving in quickly and wanting to play house is frankly immature and unreasonable in the context of children. That is the reality of dating someone with kids.So again I recommend moving to close the gap but shelf living together for six months to a year after your relocation depending on how things goGood luck ,stepparents,ddvqbbb,10,t5_2t08x

She turned into a shitbag with a serious pill problem and I completely dropped her while at the same time secretly contacting her ex and telling him he really needed to hear about how his child was being neglected with her. I was seriously concerned she or the kid would end up dead. That opened up to meeting with him and his new wife in a coffee shop to talk about what I had seen going on. They turned out to be amazing stable pleasant and allaround awesome people. I started talking to the wife more often and we got along well. Then about a year after that my SS mother started the same crappy life choices so the SM and I really started to bond. Then they bought a house in the neighborhood across the cornfield from where we built our house. And the rest is history I second the MeetUp idea.

Just open your house and say we have nothing to hide and theyll be gone soon enough.A little of my background my wife and her ex were high conflict but on opposite sides of the country.  He would provoke her until she would do something stupid like not sending SD for a visit and then he file a grievance with the court.  Which meant that she would have to trek across the country pay her lawyer a ton of cash ex represented himself and he would literally just call to argue random nonsense with her lawyer knowing the bill would go to her and not get anything settled because the judge would tell them they were both wrong and put together a  year temporary agreement.Then I came along.  I had witnessed this cycle of crazy for a year but the moment we got married I told her it was my money too now and we were going to do everything by the book regardless of what he did.  It was hard he pushed we bent.  We ate shit.  We took losses on plane tickets we had several hard conversations with our stepdaughter.

11507584,0,t3_649fsm,Youve got one of the crazy BMs on your hands. That means BM will terrorize your home until you set firm boundaries.First the lack of legal arrangement for custody and visitation is a terrible idea in general and totally unworkable with the crazy variety of BM. Fixing this should be ultimatumlevel priority for your relationship. To be plain in my opinion you would be better off leaving your DH pregnant belly and all if he will not address this.Second assuming your DH starts the process of getting custody legally settled read Say Goodbye to Crazy in the sidebar for how to handle the crazy BM.,stepparents,dg0dwic,12,t5_2t08x

Like you have been giving your all and have hit a breaking point. So Im going to ask what Id ask a bio mom who is breaking. What do you do for self care? Are you and your SO on the same page re child rearing? Have you spoken with anyone who has more insight to your situation than us internet folk?It sounds like you need to give marriage to this man a serious think over. You are for better or worse going to be in this childs life for a very long time. If you plan on having children from your loins then you need to consider the implications of a blended family and the relationship all the kids will have with each other and you and dad. I hope you are able to step back and objectively look at the situation for all parties involved. ,stepparents,dg1efb6,9,t5_2t08x

11533664,0,t3_64mgi9,You arent her stepdad. For better or worse and from her point of view it sounds worse you are her dad and thats by your own choice. I get that much of the advice people have for you here may be relevant but I think some of the strategies used by stepparents may not be appropriate. For example disengaging on the theory that it is okay to step back because this isnt your kid doesnt really apply to you. Now disengaging for her own sake may be the right thing to do better that than abuse her more but you dont get to wash your hands of this kid on the theory that she isnt your daughter. Some kids are just difficult and maybe thats the case with this girl but some of the things youve written suggest more of the problem is on your side. You admit you are being mean to her a lot and a spirited preteen is going to be defiant to an adult who treats her unfairly. Im guessing the therapist suggested you step back from disciplining her because you were falling into that somewhat common stepdad pattern of being too authoritarian with her. You are at a time in her life when even good kids will act bratty and push boundaries and there she is with a nasty unfair and verbally abusive parent. Thats pretty much a recipe for a combative rude and disrespectful child. And problems with you really could contribute to her to also acting disrespectfully toward other authority figures in her life. I think the two of you are in stuck in a pattern where she acts lousy you respond with verbal abuse not all the time but after your anger builds up and she is then even more defiant and rude in the future. The fact that you cant see any positive things in her and that you believe your wifes friends who profess to see positive traits are lying much of the time you concede they arent always lying which implies you think they are often lying suggests your thinking about her is incredibly distorted. I mean I suppose there is a slight chance you are raising someone truly evil with no redeeming qualities but it seems more likely that you are unable to see her good traits because your thinking about her has become so distorted. I think you feel that should love her since you chose to be her dad and since you dont you have to put the blame for that on her. You have decided that she must be unloveable because if she is loveable than you might feel like youve failed. Other people who profess to see her positive traits must be lying. If they arent then you might have to consider ways you are at fault.I think you and her should both be in counseling. Not together at least not yet but separately. You to deal with your anger your shame and your coping strategies and her to deal with the pain of a verbally abusive dad. You cant therapy yourself into loving her or even liking her but you can work on handling your anger in appropriate ways and strategies for treating her fairly and with compassion. ,stepparents,dg3ccyo,20,t5_2t08x

11653691,0,t1_dggrw7q,Oh wow I imagine DH is scared out of his mind with the suicide thing given your friends son. I cant even imagine being those parents. When my son was in his worst states I had to juggle my work schedule around school. I went in late left early and made sure son was never actually left alone. I was very fortunate to be able to do so. I had discussed my issue with HR at work to see if they had any resources I could use. The HR director ended up speaking with one of the executives in the company who had deep familiarity with suicide. Said exec came into my office and started with I understand your family is having some trouble which immediately put my back up and had me questioning confidentiality. He paused and said Please no this isnt about that and Im the only one who knows. She came to me because Ive been there. Please take the time you need for your son dont worry about how many hours you get in. I know whats more important right now. I sat at my desk and cried fat ugly tears of relief. And for the next couple of months I worked shortened hours and still received a full paycheck. Its not an option for everyone not all companies are as family focused as that one was but perhaps DH can talk to his HR department and see what options are available.I truly hope that your SS is just using it for emotional blackmail and not a real thing but Im glad you guys are taking it very seriously and very glad DH will be discussing it with his psychologist.gtSo I think the JUST FOR KIKI advice is the next step because I dont do that. Ever. And maybe if I did being there for DH wouldnt be so emotionally draining.Exactly. If I dont spend time doing things for myself I simply dont have the capacity to be a strong support system for DH. So I make myself take timeouts. It doesnt even have to be a big thing Im doing maybe Ill go for a drive sit on the deck by myself and watch the neighborhood kids play ball take a bubble bath lock myself in the office and write massive screeds on reddit you know just whatever.And as an aside I see youve mentioned this in another comments therapy. Yes yes yes. I see a therapist myself. It was twice a month before I was unemployed right now we are at once a month. He helps me stay stabilized within my own mind and focus on being supportive for DH and not always being angry about the situation. Its something I highly recommend for any stepparent in a contentious situation. And it counts as one of my me things that I get to do all by myself. I always come home feeling refreshed and ready to take on the next challenge.And of course come here to vent because we totally get where you are coming from ,stepparents,dggykzu,3,t5_2t08x
11654199,0,t3_66al2s,It sounds like this guys attitude towards you the protectiveness of his son not timewise but argumentwise are the problem not the residence arrangements.gtBut the second one stings a little because in the three years weve been together he and I have had two weekends away together. Just two. And I told him that I felt that way even if it was an unfair feeling and he got all grumpy about it. And then he started saying Well if we go on a trip we have to take SD on a couple of trips.That just sounds defensive. Hes probably defensive because he knows that hes prioritizing his friends so he moved the topic of conversation to the trump card the kid. Of course the kid takes first priority for both of you.I would set up a time to talk about this when youre both off topic and emphasize the talk about choices about the time you do have to yourselves or choose to make for yourselves. Start out with we have agreed hes our number one priority and this conversation is about the time we do have to ourselves. Lets talk about that time.Then talk about time during the week. If he chooses to prioritize his buddies over his son some weekends thats a different story.Do you guys have paid time off? Can you set up a vacation during the week?,stepparents,dgh0no3,5,t5_2t08x

11682761,0,t3_66nm1y,Guys.. Im all for being civil but I just feel like this is over doing it.  I think its a personal choice for the step parents that are involved.  For me personally I like a bit of separation from an EX.  I want things to be friendly and peaceful but I would not consider BM my family.  If it works for all of these parents then great.  For me... no thanks.  This post was created to get attention and these parents are not the heros everyone is making them out to be.  I think it can be really hard to have your spouses ex pranced around in front of you daily.  All of these photos with the exes posts spending holidays and vacations together.. Seriously  WHY??

Its a pretty disheartening day. We told her we were filing contempt and she said go ahead Im ready for court I have all I need. So to court we will go I suppose.

11716529,0,t1_dgo1l5p,Yeah I kind of agree with this. The benefits of an anonymous forum is people will straight up tell you things they may not in person and honestly be careful about this choice is my advice too. If you feel sure then take it slow and make sure every step of the way that its still what you want. Youre so young and have plenty of time. What I would say about your BF wanting you to be  involved is that its not his sole choice to make so take that for what it is  what hes saying his preference is now. BM can make that very difficult particularly a high conflict one such as you have on your hands and of course his daughter is her own person and has a choice too as well as you. Wait and see whether all the key players want that and whether its possible as you slowly become more involved. ,stepparents,dgo3iyk,3,t5_2t08x
11721767,0,t3_66zoa6,This is a typical high conflict move fucking up the family vacation.  If the custody order is clear and it sounds like from your attorney that it IS you just let her know that youll have the sheriff enforce it if she cant abide by the agreement.  It might be worth a factfinding call to the sheriffs office too.  I mean Im sure that dealing with that sort of crap is the LAST thing they want to be involved with but they might be able to give some helpful tips or let you know what steps are involved before they can help.  Im sure you know this but shes just showing that she can still have control even though the divorce is final.  Good luck!  Enjoy the vacation!

If we go through with that I will be elated to have my and my kids friend involved in the helping set things up with his other friend relevant there the homeschooling principal.A lot of my answer here hinges on the extent to which OP is already the school person.
