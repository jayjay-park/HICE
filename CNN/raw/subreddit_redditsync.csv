Apart from the other bug that other users have reported where you cant enter a title for submitting a new post there are two other bugs.The first is a graphical bug and occurs when you tap on a post  the area above the action bar remains transparent and looks weird. The second occurs when you swipe to hide a post.

The two that dont have that special character seem just fine.This spoiler contains no special character.This should display correctly.This spoiler contains the percentage signThe  sign may be crashing the spoiler in Reddit SyncThis contains special characters that arent  signs!ampWarning do not click the second spoiler in app because it will crash. The third spoiler opens fine for me.

But when I do want to see porn because my penis suddenly demands it I like to use Reddit as well because its such a nice aggregator of depravities so I want to see all the porn.Currently your APIs and apps and website just dont support this use case. I can select subreddits filter subreddits filter nsfw posts and look at a big list of subreddits but if I just want to see all of Reddit without porn interjected every second post I have to laboriously filter every single fucking porn Reddit from rall. And when I just want to see all the porn I would basically have to do the inverse. Multireddits dont solve this problem nsfw filters dont solve this problem apps havent solved this problem as far as I knowGiven that many people in this blue earth have penises and many people like using Reddit I feel like there is a rather large pent up demand for a simple switch between day to day Reddit and Reddit for porn,redditsync,dc446jv,17,t5_2tvpt
