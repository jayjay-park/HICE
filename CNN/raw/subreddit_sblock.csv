890612,0,t1_ch5igve,uHichico is the main resource packs guy but Ill be planning on taking care of this eventually before either of them goes live cant have one planet having an unfair edge now can we?If you do decide youd love to take care of it here a link to the pack. I already stripped out all textures that dont need changing and the Derse render Static linked is the only other reference if you feel like somethings not right gt.ltEdit Actually the copy in my renders album is a lot higher quality.  That said Zacks uses the original original rpack my render was actually made using one fudged from the Prospit rpack before gt.lt Lost em both again when I reinstalled my OS.  Another thing to keep in mind  Prospit and Derse are secretly exactly the same even down to the yellow wool. The only reason we changed the wool is because wed been without ability to set rpacks for so long.,sblock,ch5im0j,1,t5_2vu3v

Some items have additional metadata that make it too complex to save them into a slip of paper while still displaying data somewhat decently in the lore.Furthermore certain items flat out are not captchable due to prohibitive cost in future feature redacted though you are unlikely to obtain any.Captchas also dont work at all in creative.,sblock,chshun8,4,t5_2vu3v
