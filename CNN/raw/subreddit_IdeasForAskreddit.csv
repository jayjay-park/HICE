89665,0,t3_1v2ib9,Also perhaps ban threads that just end up in rants? There are threads every week where the top comments are always the same like people who dont use their turn signal!.,IdeasForAskreddit,ceomy8n,2,t5_2wja2
574651,0,t1_cg5kykd,Point taken but its still an unbelievably taxing suggestion. We are one of the biggest subreddits  if you discount rannouncements because its not a regularly active sub and average  new subscribers a day.  To throw them in the midst of a serioustagonly stretch will only confuse them and give them a false idea of what this subreddit traditionally is and also puts the burden on us to keep up with all the violations of the serious tag. In effect it will punish both them and the moderators by creating a burdensome fulltime job out of babysitting the millionandcounting subscribers and all their comments especially the new subscribers who arent familiar with the rule and may find their posting abilities restricted by the spam filter if theyve had too many posts removed.We get thousands of post submissions a day.  Restricting them to the serious tag is either going to grind the submission rate to a halt and require the mods essentially approve every post to the subreddit to verify that each submission is a valid post for a serious tag as well as kepe up with the probably tens of thousands of comments to those threads if theyre the only ones being submitted.  We literally cant do that a  comment thread bogs down so bad when trying to load comments that its impossible to regularly scan the thread.If you want allseriousallthetime theres rtrueaskreddit for that.  Being smaller in size makes it much more manageable for the mod team.  But raskreddit with its submission rate number of comments daily and shear amount of subscribers and steady influx of new users simply is not in the position to do this.  At the very least wed need better servers to handle the load infinitely more mods to keep up with the flow and a userbase we could actually trust to understand respect the serious which re really seem to be losing on and I think its about time for a refresher given the already unbelieavable amount of time we spend in the moqueue or threads pruning comments from serious threads.Remember were volunteers doing the best we can with the system we have.  These ideas and suggestions are great and always welcome but when it comes down to it users need to understand whats actually feasible and not blame us  for saying somethings just impossible to do.  Theory and Application are unfortunately two very different things especially on reddi. ,IdeasForAskreddit,cg5lc8i,5,t5_2wja2

1071104,0,t3_26dka2,This is the responsibility of the OP.  If they forget to put the tag on their post it obviously isnt important enough for a serious tag.What needs to be done is people stop posting things like Mods can you make this serious?  or You should haveI should have made this serious   Its something you should consider before posting. Marking the thread serious after the fact will screw up the audomod and the modding in the sub.  As you cannot ban the comment that came in before the tag or the comments responding to the comments that happened before the tag.You see what I am trying to say here?,IdeasForAskreddit,chq1ewn,1,t5_2wja2
1747705,0,t1_cjzg3uy,It is definitely quite annoying when you do get a widely popular post going that people are obviously enjoying thats on its way to the front page of AskReddit or sometimes even Reddit Front and its removed for a minor technicality on the rules.The easiest step in my opinion would be for a clarification in the rules that would remove this gray area for how titles need to be formatted.,IdeasForAskreddit,cjzghzp,2,t5_2wja2

1812085,0,t3_2e9nal,Personally I kind of like those. Sure theyre annoying as hell for the most part but usually theres at least one witty comment. Like that thread where the title said Ireland instead of island and somebody replied with something like Look I know people are making fun of this for the typo so Im gonna give you a real response since I know you really meant island. For my response Ill be using the island of Ireland as an example,IdeasForAskreddit,ck7j7zo,1,t5_2wja2
1830658,0,t3_2fgh73,The number of sexual related post is nowhere near as bad as it once was when the first week ban hit. If there are a  lot of sex topics and not requests for links that means users have questions they want to ask. Sex is a popular topic and many people try to discuss things like this so they have a better understanding or dont feel alone in a matter. The first week ban was more than enough. The thread is not actually being overwhelmed with sex posts which means the users who enjoy sexual topics have held back as to prevent another weekly ban. A major difficulty was after the ban hit we had way too many people running to this sub asking for bans on other less important things. Bans do not accomplish anything as people will find ways to get around it or make it worse in other ways and people asking for bans without providing any real ideas are not contributing to anything. Disclaimer  I am not a mod of this sub. If you read this post and disclaimer and still believe I am a mod you hold liability for your ignorance. ,IdeasForAskreddit,ck9scr9,0,t5_2wja2
