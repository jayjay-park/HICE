9336413,0,t3_58dcr6,Boots is a perfect example of the EPs kind of cheesymusicalcountrypopindie sound that flows through the whole EP. I didnt get into the EP until recently but I loved it once I finally sat down and gave it a listen. There is something really endearing about the whole thing just how it doesnt take itself too seriously and just tries to have fun. Boots is a great one on the EP for that reason its just kind of over the top and I love it. ,imaginedragons,d8zgip9,9,t5_2urqu
