The hostage takers had gas masks and werent affected by the gas as well. Some of the Spetsnaz even succumbed to the gas. It was a total cluster fuck. They waited way longer than they should have to provide medical care to the hostages and when they did the EMS services werent prepared to deal with chemical poisoning they were expecting gun shot and explosion injuries. The Russian government tried to down play and cover up exactly what happened but it was a royal fuck up not some insidious message to future terrorists. ,YouSeeComrade,cwf7bnt,30,t5_39m3t

6858970,0,t1_d0tkrc8,I mean Ive heard of that before referring to engines. But having built disassembled swapped parts around and pretty much anything you can think of regarding an ar for over a decade I can tell you for a fact that standard bolts are interchangeable just like the majority of an at and this guy has no idea what hes talking about. An ar will stop functioning properly long before its so worn it cant take a standard bolt and vice versa. The reason for not swapping bolts around unless you have a reason to swap so then you do because you can actually swap them isnt them being worn to the gun its that generally speaking there just isnt a reason to swap bolts around.,YouSeeComrade,d0trulh,4,t5_39m3t
