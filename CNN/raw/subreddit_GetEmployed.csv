Take learned lessons and apply them to your next interview! Remember these companies that you are applying to arent the ones that rejected you they are a new exciting opportunity! You have to get stoked on these places if you dont it shows in the cover letter and eventually in the interview.Why do you say the last interviews did not go well? What exactly happened? Were you not prepared for them? Ive done far too many interviews no I wasnt offered a job for all of them. Just means I wasnt the right fit maybe not the right experience. Its nothing personal and it cant be taken that way. I treat an interview as if I were meeting a client or potential client. Its a chance to sit down to get to know this person the company and really connect with the person. Try to feed off what they are asking or telling you. Small things can go a long way.

But I feel the same way you seem to with the whole search thing. But heres some suggestions on how to break out of the analysis paralysisCome up with  answers that you want to give in the interview.  Accomplishments ideas.. whatever. Come up with  and work them into the interview as best you can. Find a way to meditate for about  min. before the interview. Just let your mind be free and still. Sit in your car in the parking lot or even in the restroom if you have to. Put your focus on the interviewer during the interviewer and stay present with the interviewer. You can analyze the data afterward the interview itself is just data collection. You need to know what the interviewer expects. Dont worry about selling. You know who worries about selling? Shitty Salesmen. Good salesmen dont sell you anything they just provide information. You mention being a biologist... if youre good enough to publish a paper youre good at providing information. The only pressure you have is to get the job... thats an external pressure that you ultimately have no control over. There is no need to worry about things you have no control over.

Its the best way to determine if youd be happy working for this employer and whether your goals are aligned with theirs.Here are  questions you should consider asking in a job interview if they werent already answered to help you get a better sense of the role and the company and to help you prepare for the next steps. Who do you think would be the ideal candidate for this position and how do I compare?. Who held this position previously? Why is heshe leaving the role?. What do you like most about working for this company?. Can you walk me through the typical day of someone in this role?. How do you evaluate success here?. How would you describe the companys culture?. Will I have an opportunity to meet those who would be part of my staffmy manager during the interview process?. Can you tell me what steps need to be completed before your company can generate an offer?. What distinguishes this company from its competitors?. Is there anyone else I need to meet with?Is there anyone else you would like me to meet with?. Is there anything we havent covered that you think is important to know about working here?. Is there anything else I can provide to help you make your decision?. What can I do to show you Im a great fit for this job?.

6552059,0,t3_451xbx,Congrats on getting an interview! Ive always been pretty good at interviews and then worked for a tech company conducting interviews for a bit over a year so Ive been exposed to some great and bad interviews.First of all be mindful of your social media presence. Especially considering you will be working with kids.I always learn everything I can about the company and the position. Know their goals and vision and try to communicate how hiring you will help them achieve it. Learn about their company culture and values. Sometimes with a little research you can figure out what they value. An example my company valued honestly and the ability to admit and learning from your mistakes. We looked for reasonable people who understood nobody is perfect but you always try harder next time. When we asked about a candidates failures and their response was sincere and honest we knew they would fit well culturally.I would also study interview questions. Try googling the company websites like interviewcake and glassdoor will have posts from employees which will often include specific questions. Additionally I review commonly asked interview questions. Its a good exercise to have some answers in mind so you arent stumped.That is a good resource.At the end they will ask you if you have any questions. this seems like a pretty good resource. Try to ask at least  questions. I personally refrain from asking about money.And finally the best advice I was given  embrace the silence. Once they ask you a question try to give a direct and concise answer. As the interviewer I would need a minute to document the response. Silence can make you uneasy or make you start questioning your response. Be confident in your answers and you will do great!,GetEmployed,czx1c3d,1,t5_2uagc

What Id recommend is read up on some behavioral questions explain a time where you had difficulty with a coworker and such look up the company for recent actives in the news so youll be able to ask Oh I see the company has acquired  how do you think this will affect the company and if the company has a glassdoor page do some research if they ask some brain teasers if so then look some up!

The body of the letter should serve as a personal narrative providing the humanelement complement to your CV. Tie yourself to the job show that youre the puzzle piece with exactly the edges theyre looking for and perhaps request an interview.Really though dont do that for a part time job.

10681488,0,t3_5spv0z,Its very tough to make big changes like the ones youre makingcompared to the ones youve mentioned getting a job will be easy as pie as long as you try hey rhyme.I have one piece of advice for youwhatever job you go for remember that the employer doesnt need to know your life story. They dont need to know about the  coupon or how many times youve switched majors. They dont even need to know you have any employment history. Theyre also not allowed to ask your age but if they did  is pretty young and I dont think think theyd be judging you for a lack of work history. It takes time for a lot of people to figure out what they want to do in lifeeven when they graduate or get a good job and dont find it satisfying. Theres really no shame in trying different things or taking a break from school. Youre doing just fine.I guess I have another piece of advicewhoever youre comparing yourself to stop. Maybe you know a few people your age who seem to have it all figured outtheyre lucky. Im sure there are things you have that they dont. I only say this because you mention feeling like a failuretheres clearly a standard youre comparing yourself to. From where I sit youre really young resilient and thoughtful and you have plenty of time to figure things out. A job is a good next step because you will learn what you want and dont want out of your next one.,GetEmployed,ddhpqkh,2,t5_2uagc

11272527,0,t3_60uh42,Id say its definitely a red flag. If you take the job and they do end runs around you in the future can you be surprised? If they will do this thing that is very out of the norm will they do other outofthenorm activities in the future out of a similar disregard for how it impacts you...for example asking you to work late off the clock or something else equally shady?While youre interviewing if you tell them they were out of line you may not get the job. Youll at the very least put them off so maybe they offer you less money. So you may not want to weaken your footing. If the red flag is big enough and you have other equally good prospects you may want to tell them theyre out of line that youre out and that if they dont want to chase off top talent they need to get it together. If you really needwant this job I wouldnt say anything until after theyve made the offer with terms attached salary vacation etc....then Id say Ill take it but I need to know that you trust me from now on so this was out of line and I need to know that youre not going to be looking over my shoulder every  seconds.,GetEmployed,df9q3a4,3,t5_2uagc
