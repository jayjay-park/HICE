Once you know where they look for those you can spot any differences later on. ,bodylanguage,cnv2ltq,1,t5_2rken

I dont know if Im worried about him forcibly trying to have sex with me. But I am very scared that his anger and frustration could make me a target for other sorts of verbalemotional abuse. ,bodylanguage,cysa568,1,t5_2rken

And to a point i agree with you a legit photo can tell you far more than when you pose for one. You can still tell quite a bit from a person using your dad for example even tho he may be confident in his personality its interesting that doesnt take good photos. It could be a bunch of things like angle of the picture or a sneeze  i would think thats hilarious tho and not consider it an awkward picture but not every picture can have an excuse even if you pose. However the OP can determine what information is relivent since she knows more about the situation. We only get one picture ,bodylanguage,dclhx3i,2,t5_2rken
