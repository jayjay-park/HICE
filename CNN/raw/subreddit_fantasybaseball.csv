61085,0,t3_1ut1rh,I personally think he will.  Remember hes  this year... most guys are still figuring things out in the minor leagues at that age.  He had a disappointing year for sure but keep in mind why  he missed time due to a burst appendix and a broken jaw from a HBP.  Nothing that should make you think he is a serial injury risk.  this guy had a . season at age  that is an epic season for such a young guy.  Heyward has the upside for a  season which would make him a  outfielder.  So Id be comfortable drafting him as a  outfielder... or approx  overall.  sorry for the wide range but it is still early.   ,fantasybaseball,celdv2y,2,t5_2quxe

109708,0,t1_ceqw0y4,Lemme take a look at it and fire off some concerns.  Some might be me missing the point on something some might have solutions that already exist but arent in this draft some might need solutions invented and some might be real problems.  Here we go...Settings First thing I see is its x but you have Ks listed twice and dont need BB as thats part of WHIP and that gets you back to x.  Id ditch HR and just use SLG as that factors in there and using both will give a huge advantage to power hitters.  That makes it x with three counting stats and two ratios for both.man minor leagues with  teams is a lot of players  to be exact.  Might want to go with a few less maybe  a team total to start.  You can always expand if you wish.With a snake draft on minor leaguers how is their value determined once they lose their eligibility nevermind I see the ARB rules?  And youre going to have a nd draft in August during the season too?  Why not just wait and have the one each preseason?  Your arbitration scale mentions points but Im guessing that will be rank as youre going category HH.  Using the arbitration scale for rising rookies makes them incredibly cheap and controllableContracts youre planning to keep tabs on how many years each contract began as?A note on your auction rules teams should have to draft until all rosters are full.Do you get hit with a cap penalty if you drop someone in the last year of their deal?  So if you paid lets say  at the beginning of the year youd then pay another  no matter when you drop them?IR so I place a player on the DL and their salary doesnt count towards the cap while there.  Does it cost me money to add a replacement?  Can I sign that replacement to a contract?  What if I trade for a player or add them off waivers and that player has years left on their deal?  What happens at the end of the year if I never activate the player off the DL?  That DLd player is activated again?  What if that now puts me over the cap?  If I activate the player off the DL during the season what happens to the player I drop?  I take a cap hit for releasing them?Waivers Pretty sure FAAB is used to acquire players off waivers in a silent auction not free agents so how are you setting the value for new free agents? The way things are setup it looks like you have some sort of miniauctions going on for each player but how do you do that without waivers?  And how are you assigning contracts once added?  Trades Again what about unbalanced trades?  Lets say I deal one players with a  deal for two players each on  deals.  I then have to drop someone who may or may not be claimed off waivers.  If they are am I free of the cap hitif not do I have to eat that?  What if that puts me over the cap?  I guess Id have to factor the potential cap hit into the deal.  What about the team getting the one player they now have an open roster spot.  Can they just add a free agent?  Are they ?  Can I sign them long term?  What if I trade a prospect for a major leaguer?Buyouts So its September nd and my team is out of the race.  I decide to drop some or all of my players.  The cap hit wont hit me until next yeardoes that hit include this current season?  No one can make waiver bids on these players as their contracts are too big to fit under anyone elses cap.  They clear waivers and become free agents.  Again Im unclear on what the method is for adding free agents as you imply some sort of auction.  Could I add these guys for cheap now?  Contending teams would likely be out of cap space and FAAB dollars in September.  Whats to keep me from dropping all my players and then readding where I might be the only bidder?  Or taking the cap hit and then being wide open for the next season?  What implications are there if I do this preSept  or postSept ?  What happens to prospects at years end?  Do I have to drop someone to make room once they graduate?  Does this cost me?  What about prospect promoted midseason?  Do I have to pay to drop someone to call them up?  Can I demote them later?  What happens to that now empty slot?  I have to pay to add someone again?  What if I have more than the allowed limit because of tradesdo I need to drop players until Im at the limit?In addition to these issues you still have admin complications including countless minioperations that need to be done for every transaction and then need to be tracked the rest of the season and possibly beyond no apparatus for midseason player acquisition of free agents nor a way to assign contracts and there is nothing in there about how the league then functions in regards to cap contracts prospects etc in years  and beyond.But the biggest problem is that there are many ways to lose cap space and not many to free any up.  Not only are almost all the players controlled for a very long time but each transaction takes a giant bite out of the salary cap.  You end up having a sort of reverse inflation deflation I suppose where pretty soon all activity will lock up.  Trades are going to be really tough too if you want things to stay under the cap.Like I said at the start I went through this  years agoI might have even started with the same contract!  I then spent months not just the few minutes I took right now going over every contingency then adding rules changing structures etc yes I had more than one occasion of shooting up in bed in the middle of the night with whatifs Id just thought of until I came up with the system Im using now.  It works great and has been tested by some of the most devious minds in the game mine included and it works damn near perfectly.

260687,0,t3_1x35nj,You spent  on closers haha you can get an elite hitter for that. Mark Trumbo is not the type of player for your team. Having him as your number one outfielder feels too risky. Since you went so heavy on pitching you need to count on an assembly of low risk hitters that offer reliable and consistent production. I like the picks of Phillips Prado and Beltran because you pretty much know what kind of numbers theyre going to give you. Nothing spectacular but solid. I think you shouldve targeted Matt Holliday instead of having Trumbo as your number one outfielder. You could use  from Trumbo and the rest out of your massive closer budget. I understand the logic though it seems like you are counting on Trumbos HRs because the rest of your lineup wont hit too many of those.

I believe in both but I dont think their seasons will replicate last years.I dont love anyone in your OF.Wright and Longoria is huge. Having probably two of the best Bs in baseball makes you eligible for big trade later this year where you can acquire the OF you didnt draft.Depending on where you drafted Pujols that could be a very good value.I hate James Shields for fantasy purposes.Love the Zach Wheeler pick.,fantasybaseball,cfrqja3,3,t5_2quxe
455076,0,t3_1zalyq,You have some solid keepers. Id drop Kipnis and Zimmerman and keep the other . Maybe keep Kipnis instead of Encarnacion hes no longer B eligble and try to get one of the sleeper B like Abreu that you should be able to get in the middle roundsThe other hitters are for sure keeps. Id toss up between Kipnis and Encarnacion. You can always find Ace pitchers in later rounds and waivers. Id just keep Darvish there.,fantasybaseball,cfrzogu,2,t5_2quxe
455114,0,t3_1z9mxd,Okay. Just to sort this out. BTW I dont know why you did the next  picks or so cause its really about  before the first one. And youre only in an team league Never mind. I assume the first dash is where your nd pick would come up. Your Keepers  Darvish Encarnacion Upton Machado CJ WilsonFirst round  Id probably target Jose Fernandez or Carlos Gomez. The obvious guys will be gone Hanley Beltre Fielder Braun Ells so unless one of them falls to you try to bolster your OF or SP early. SP especially because a lot of the good ones are kept.Second round  Youre going to have the top pick. I think you have to go high upside here. Bumgarner is a good pick and if you have Darvish Bumgarner JoFer you have a lot of time to wait before you get another starter. You can almost wait until Shelby Teheran and Wacha. Maybe Freddie Freeman falls to you? If so I think having FreemanEE is just amazing. Gives you a lot of RBIHR.Other than BumgarnerFreeman you could grab Desmond Reyes or Pedroia. Just to strengthen your MI early.Third Round  Now youre around Allen Craig level. I think I would get Craig Adrian Gonzalez or Matt Carpenter. Carpenter only if you have an opening at B.You can get a high RBIR guy in the outfield with Craig which your team really needs. Especially if Upton disappoints again or you didnt grab GomezFreeman.Fourth Round  Youve probably got all your infield spots filled by now. Maybe you need a SS but theres a lot left way later. I think here is where you should fill catcher with Mauer. I think hes going to have a lot of value this year especially if he plays every day at B.If you dont like Mauer maybe you grab another starter just to strengthen an already elite group. Gerrit Cole Zimmermann Minor. All good picks.If that doesnt float your boat maybe Heyward or Donaldson fell to you. Or you could always grab ChapmanHolland to start off your closers strong.FifthRound  Basically the same as the fourth. Whoever is there who fills a need. Possibly another OF? I like Werth and Brown this year. Neither are bad picks for your OF.SixthRound  It gets interesting here. Do you grab another starter? Shelby Miller is awfully tempting.Maybe you dont have a SS yet? Everth provides  steal potential. Your team lacks an elite base stealer.Beyond  After that its hard to say. Theres too many variables so just go with guys you like. If a guy falls  rounds and youre even mildly interested its usually better than taking a guy  rounds early. Most of the time a guy you want to reach for ends up being there your next pick anyway.I notice you have Gray Salazar and Abreu circled. I wouldnt reach for Abreu if you draft how I just did. You wouldnt really have a need for his power. Especially with Encarnacion at B already.Im all for GraySalazar though. I think you could have  extremely good starters if you try to.By the way why the hell did you keep CJ Wilson? Just wondering.,fantasybaseball,cfrzu35,2,t5_2quxe

504394,0,t1_cfxiuug,I read tons and tons and tons of articles first starting out. Matthew berry is one I frequently follow and agree with. Read his manifesto for more. But dont reach. If your second pick is late first round and there arent any bb around take the OF. They are shallow but Im not gonna take a guy  picks before hes available. In baseball there are a total of  amazing players and the rest are similar or really good in one stat. The draft round is based on your league. Usually about  rounds. Usually  hitter spots.  Pitching. And the rest are bench spots. You dont have to switch it every day. You can set your roster up for a few days in advance. But in baseball you have to rotate your pitchers in and out because there arent enough spots for them all. If I were you though I wouldnt just draft one good pitcher. I made that mistake. Its an average over  days. So your one pitcher will only pitch  or  days that week. Even if he pitches a perfect game and two other guys get shelled that week youre gonna lose era and whip. My strategy for you if you dont wanna switch every day would be punt Ks. Grab  good to really good pitchers in the first  rounds. Worry more about era and whip. That way you dont have to switch and can keep those guys in starting spots all week. Get steals late in the draft and worry about power and runs. Usually the team with the highest runs winsmeans your on base getting RBIs. Good luck! ,fantasybaseball,cfxlpof,1,t5_2quxe

If the innings minimum is low and your opponents first few SPs have very strong starts then he can just rest the rest of his pitchers and possibly beat you in ERA and WHIP while punting wins ks and saves. If there isnt a cap on per week acquisitions he can do the reverse stream pitchers and punt ERA and WHIP to win Ks and wins. Also how many closers are you planning on holdingcan you start? Youll probably need   to win saves every week.Your strategy is also very vulnerable to injury.

Youll never win saves but you can stack your roster with SPs and youll have a much easier time winning Ks and Wins each week. Its up to you if you want to punt saves but you certainly dont have to.

642659,0,t3_21idtw,Yes this is viable. I did it last year and weve since added minimums and maximums for games started each week bc it was a cheap strategy that worked too well. Grab one top closer Jansen then a bunch of closers who have good numbers but low saves like Casey Janssen he might be hurt. Then make sure to grab every closer in waiting Brothers Farquhar too late for Soria. Now yes a . IP w  ER can and probably will ruin a week or two for you but people overestimate the effect. With all relievers and  pitching spots you can basically afford ER a week and be good. Another option should you notice other people going all relievers is to stream starters and take QS and IP every week. Just remember a league of  players can in my experience sustain  steaming teams and  allreliever teams before the well dries up and youre getting in each others way. So I submit a third option draft as normal. Get a stud pitcher and a few decent closers and spend the rest on hitting. Then at the end of the draft if nobody did the allreliever strategy youre golden. Trade your starter for a stud hitter at a position you missed on dump your entire staff and start gobbling up middle relievers who could get the closer job. Get on the Closer Monkey mailing list and wait patiently for injuries. You just need to survive for  weeks or so until you get your staff settled and then youre golden for a run at the playoffs. ,fantasybaseball,cgdbk8k,1,t5_2quxe

664578,0,t1_cgfsz3q,Strasburg was in the conversation but he was off the board too early in every instance. Its a coin flip for those two to me so give me the guy with the later ADP. When I draft SPs the last thing I am thinking about is Wins. Those come or they dont. I really like Avisail Garcia. I kept him in a  team keeper league. In fact I was worried he was going to haunt the Sox for years as a Tiger before they acquired him. His bat will play and if he hits third this season like it looks like he might he will be one of the most added OFs in fantasy baseball this year.Bogaerts was born in  and he was good in the World freaking Series last year as a  year old. His stats in the minors are ridiculous when you consider his age vs the average age of the league. If he sticks at ss he is going to be a first round fantasy pick for the majority of the next  years. Nothing special? Not yet maybe.Prado is boring but where does he hurt you?

665586,0,t3_21r3pd,Jedd Gyorko  He mashed the ball last year before hurting his groin and I think a big part of his struggles after coming back stemmed from that. Knowing he was available late let me be comfortable in passing over b.Everth Cabrera  Was killing it at shortstop last year before he got suspended. Hes good at taking walks and stealing bases. He had been kinda inconsistent so far but his walks are up and that could mean hes finally got this batting thing figured out. Could go . with  strike outs but could also go . . I love his upside where hes going.Chris Carter  Strikes out like crazy but whats weird is his homeaway split in terms of batting average and power. He was .something at home and . away with most his power also coming away from home. If he could somehow find a way to normalize that he could be super useful.As for pitchers its probably Buchholz and Kuroda. Both are going pretty low both had monster st halves. One usually ends up hurt the other usually ends up fading out but for where you can get them in a draft I really feel like they are worth it or what they could do in the st half. I kinda draft these guys late knowing I will have to try and trade them or drop them or at least watch their match ups later in the year and dont get too caught up in waiting for them to get out of their slumps.,fantasybaseball,cgfxczd,5,t5_2quxe

No and I wouldnt sell them personally but its not outside the realm of possibility. Danks has been really great after taking years to recover from his own injury so theres the slight possibility he bounces back to being a solid SP in fantasy again and this is the first step.The point is. We dont know.Heres something I posted in another one of these discussionsgtMany years ago when Johan Santana was still considered a fantasy ace we had an owner trade him for a young speed only centerfielder who had never seen more than  AB. It looked very unbalanced at the time and we almost vetoed it. The owner getting a relatively unknown Michael Bourn said he really needed speed and was fine with SP. I knew it was a bad trade but as LM I let it through.Santana went on to have a . ERA in June and then wound up missing the last  weeks of the season with an injury. Bourn meanwhile exploded for a league leading  stolen bases while hitting . and eclipsed the  AB mark. gtThe owner that received Santana missed the playoffs.

944249,0,t1_chbl4kk,The  HRs on the season I can totally buy especially since hes already banked  this year. Thats just  more homers over nearly  months which is very doable if Rasmus can stay healthy.  Its the average that I am not buying. I think hes a lot closer to a . hitter than a . hitter. Unfortunately Rasmus doesnt run at all these days  SB in  and  which also hurts his value. Hes a negative contributor in SB and AVG.  Basically as a quick baseline were talking about a  HR SB starting point. Without the average were looking at Raul Ibanez  HR  SB .  RBI  R or Mitch Moreland of last year  HR  SB .  RBI  R. Neither of those options are too appealing unless youre in a pretty deep league and really hurting for some pop. Slightly more powerful versions would be Adam Dunn  HR  SB .

981628,0,t3_25c74i,Considering Frieri is back in the closers role you should definitely explore your free agent options. Smith holds very little shortterm value and there is almost certainly a more optimal way to utilize that roster spot.Robbie Erlin is a very interesting starting point and a topic Ive been interested in ever since he was acquired by San Diego in the deal that brought relieface Mike Adams to Arlington back in .Hes  lefthanded  years old and only throws  mph... so why is he interesting?Well to start he has the benefit of pitching in the National League and in Petco Park.The main thing that stands out about Erlins stats is his ability to avoid walking guys. He only has  innings pitched at the MLBlevel but his . career BBrate is certainly promising . in . IP so far this season. His MiLB BBs were always sparkling including a spectacular .. KrateBBrate combo in  innings split between A and AA as a year old  IP in AA. Okay so he throws  and doesnt walk very many guys... cool? Well he strikes out guys too  his . Krate puts him th in baseball higher than Jeff Samardzija Gerrit Cole Jered Weaver Julio Teheran and Sonny Gray. . . . . ..Those are the respective walk rates of that group of pitchers  only Teheran a commandspecialist has Erlin beat. Now obviously we are dealing with small sample sizes here and K  BB are just two stat categories  albeit the first two I look at when analyzing a pitchers stats  so we need to take these numbers with a grain of salt.With that said Im not claiming Erlin to be a better pitcher than any of the aforementioned five guys owned in almost all leagues... Im just repeating the stats for you.The part that makes Erlin very interesting is his . FIP. SIERA and his current . WHIP. In many leagues a guy with a  Krate translates to .. K for those less acquainted with K a . ERA and . WHIP pitching in Petco is at the very least an excellent streaming option.The crucial thing is Erlins  has actually been somewhat unlucky  . BABIP . LOB . HRFB. The HRFB could see a tick upwards but the BABIP and strand rate could very well be due for regression in Erlins favor. Ill say the regression in both HRFB and LOB will more or less negate each other and his yearend ERA will stabilize near his SIERA at roughly . the BABIP will come down to around . giving Erlin the benefit of the doubt based on his . swinging strike rate  lowering his WHIP under ..TLDR Given his home ballpark Erlins the type of young arm I want to bolster the backend of my fantasy rotation. By no means is he someone Id rely upon as anything better than your th or th starter but he will sprinkle a few gems in with an overall very solid season . ERA. WHIP K and if youre smart enough to skip those starts at Colorado and be selective with when you use him youll be rewarded even more handsomely.To OP uaubgrad considering the lack of SP depth in your free agent pool Id suggest making the proposed move and dropping Smith for Erlin. ,fantasybaseball,chfvauf,8,t5_2quxe

983329,0,t3_25db8t,Honestly though it wouldnt be crazy if Gomez outproduced Trout this year. Its not likely but its absolutely possible.  Trouts striking out  right now  which is pretty terrible by most standards. His walk rate is down from last year . to ..  He only has four SB opportunities on the season  out of  and theres reason to believe this trend will continue all season given Anaheims recent massive investment in the young baseball wunderkind.  Hes swinging through more pitches . compared to . last year  its very possible that pitchers have adapted slightly to the year old phenom remember hes still only   most prospects his age are getting their first taste of AA this year. Trouts numbers simply are lackluster compared to expectations on pace for about  while Carlos Gomez is off to a fantastic start.Gomez is sitting at  right now compared to Trouts . Gomez has converted on  of his  steal attempts and figures to receive quite a bit more steal opportunities than Trout given Milwaukees minimal  year.M investment in him.Trout is clearly the better player in real life as Gomez is basically a bag of tools that just recently figured out how to play baseball while Trout as we all know is a cyborg sent from the year  trained specifically to be better than everybody else in every facet of the game.Theres no way Im trading my Mike Trout for Carlos Gomez straight up  but it is absolutely feasible that Gomez in fact outproduces Trout all by himself. Currently Gomez is on pace to basically match Trout in R RBI and AVG and actually trump him in HR and SB. So if I had the first overall pick and drafted Trout only to see him underwhelm through the first  of the season and desperately needed help in my rotation..

1194416,0,t1_ci3z5ty,Close but thats not a fair characterization. Yes Chisenhall has been on a tear but what Im saying is that he absolutely categorically will by no chance remain at anything close to this pace. Its not even a question  he wont. He wont even stay close to it. Hes going to slow down and slow down in a hurry. Some guys can sustain a high BABIP speedsters mostly  Chisenhall is not one of them. As that BABIP comes down so too will that BA and along with it all those pretty counting stats. Im not saying what Davis is doing is more normal. Im saying what Davis is doing is actually sustainable while what Chisenhalls been doing isnt. Look at it this way Davis has been roughly comparable to Chisenhall over the last month despite having a significantly lower BABIP. If hed had the same BABIP or even a similar one he would have had a better month than Chisenhall. As such if we make the reasonable assumption of both players having a reasonable BABIP the rest of the way Davis comes out ahead. ,fantasybaseball,ci3zo3a,1,t5_2quxe

1286981,0,t1_cie7171,Thanks for responding Drumline and you make some good points. There are as many definitions of Sell High as there are for Buy Low and I tried to be clear as to the types I was discussing. Most of the owners I play with would seldom jump on a player who was seriously overperforming so we dont even make such offers if we want to keep the lines open. Im talking about players you can get the most for right now compared to whatever their usual value would be even if we are talking about a round or two upgrade. The first group of SP I listed have  things that many other top  SP dont have. I chose the guys with the highest level of name value as that often does help in trade talks more than just the numbers. Most of those pitchers have pretty loyal fan bases. The other thing they all have is WHIPs under . and ERAs quite a bit lower than their lifetime ERAs. Do you think all those guys will finish the nd half with WHIPs under .? Pitching is so good and so deep now that it is not easy to pull off a Sell High of any serious magnitude. I did consider Cueto but I didnt think he would command as much value back in trade as the guys I did list. If Kershaw gets me Miggy or Trout in June then I believe that is a Sell High.,fantasybaseball,cieegvf,0,t5_2quxe

Id argue that how you pitch through an entire home stretch of a season is more important than how you do over  randomly dispersed starts. Klubers entire nd half ERA is . to Felixs .. Thats huge and shows me that Felix regressed a bit as the season went on while Kluber got stronger when it was crunch time.Kluber also had  complete games to Felixs . In those three games he had  Earned Runs. This pushes me in Klubers direction as well especially since they all came in the nd half.

It is just that he has so much power.  He absolutely crushes the ball as you showed me in your other post top  in flyball distance.  He is certainly the most risky of the top ten picks this season.

Cincy was a mess last year in general he had the knee scope and part of it could just be a speedbump of sorts where he had a down year.All comes down to his ADP but Id be surprised if he wasnt going in the s compared to his usual ish ADP I think that has been his going rate correct me if Im wrong. Most men have their price where would you draft him? Or are you out and have no interest?In those prime years you didnt really turn a profit when you drafted him but he did his job and provided the production and stability over the course of a full season not necessarily on any given week needed to account for what you paid.

He most likely wont hit  HRs career high of  in  and expecting a major HR threat is probably unrealistic when you take into account his home ball park. Belt is the type of player that will have a good season because he has a pretty high floor but his low ceiling is what is limiting him in regards to where I actually draft him. I dont think you can blame anyone for taking the risk of drafting Trumbo Moss Carter Chris Davis Adams or Santana for their juicy  HR upside. Getting that many HR from that ADP can win you a fantasy season.

Id lean towards Walker since hes been compared to King Felix for years now and has a slightly better track record.Taillon and Wheeler both havin that TJ surgery both pitch in the NL in great pitchers parks and both have good mid s stuff. Taillon will be back this year but hasnt blown away the competition in the minors while Wheeler is at least a year away and IMO has too high a walk rate to bank on year in and year out.

Primarily not sure if you have enough quality IP. Samardzija is  and McHugh close behind but Harvey probably  Carrasco maybe a touch more the rest questionable to even hit those levels. Might seem radical but I think Donaldson is a good trade chip.

You have more options for streaming starts and in roto leagues I love scooping up elite setup men and deploying them to take advantage of an otherwise dead spot in my starting lineup. Elite relievers can help you with Ks and ratios without burning through your starts cap and in the event of a trade or injury to the current closer you step into a tremendously valuable asset.

I think it works only if you can get those relievers on the cheap andor get the later guys for a solid value.  Just dont aim for the big names like Chapman and Kimbrel.  Theyll go for more than you should pay for the stud reliever strategy.  Try Boxberger Clippard Robertson then aim for excellent nonclosers for  with Wade Davis Andrew Miller Pat Neshek and Ken Giles.  OBviously not all of them but be aware of them all so you dont overpay.Dont hesitate to snag an excellent SP for higher if it means youre getting a good value though.

If however there are holdover limits and you cant keep a guy past a year or two I can  see the Donaldson Degrom side as the way to go.

For starters you have the absolute elite in Trout and Altuve who are both going to score a lot of points through many ways. You have potential to lead your league in SB for sure as well as AVG.  I think your pitching is decent with your top  obviously being Harvey Cueto and Sale. Harvey is a bit of a gamble coming back from TJ but I expect him to still produce but not to what he did two years ago. Thats just my quick rating but overall I think you got a good team.

Third if you bothered to look up what wOBA means youd know that it adds weights to hits with various situations of runners on base. This means that with an insane lineup like the dodgers had last year puigs wOBA obviously gets inflated.Fourth and most important you didnt consider nearly enough stats to rank puig.

As for Corbin I give gausman the slight edge because  they had extremely similar seasons last year  gausman has an elite pedigree and  after his first couple outings Gausman has been lights out . ERA and Ks in his last  IP Moreover gausman has had his elite stuff working in all his outings  hes been touching  mph and experimenting with throwing high heat which should lead to better K numbers  has gotten a nice handle on his new curveball has had his splitter working as well as ever and has been throwing his slider which was never on par with his other pitches less and less.Ill put a disclaimer on this though due to the fact that Im an LSU grad so I may be a bit of a gausman homer.,fantasybaseball,cr73yje,2,t5_2quxe

3981442,0,t3_362fx1,I usually find it pretty hard to give up on guys with long solid track records. If a guy has multiple productive seasons in his recent past then I like to look at Fangraphs to see if theres any underlying cause for a veteran to be significantly underperforming. Ultimately I think it comes down to the same thing that it comes down to with most playerdrop decisions  is there a more productive player available and do I think my current veteran will get snapped up immediately by another manager.It makes me think of Ryan Zimmerman vs Adam LaRoche. I own Zimmerman and kept trying to convince myself to drop him through his struggles although the RBIs are there but I just couldnt do it because with his recent history and multiposition eligibility I knew another owner would grab him. But if I also had LaRoche I would have dropped him weeks ago because I just dont need a struggling b on my team even though just last year he hit hrrbi.Its interesting that you mention these three guys because I have a hard time seeing them as veterans. Theyve all been around for a while but altogether they have only seven seasons of  games played  of those being Morse there isnt much of a track record on which we can pin a lot of hope.For what its worth I think Pearce and Morse can be dropped. Pearce has one good major league season and no longer seems to be an every day player and it seems like Morse may be aging out of his prime years. With Carter Ill just say what Ive read on this sub a bunch of times  this is kind of what you sign up for. Personally I dont want him and Im not sure when the big hot streak is coming but hes been a slam dunk  homer pace the past three seasons so I feel like theres more leeway here since part of his track record is exactly these kinds of slumps.,fantasybaseball,cra4a66,4,t5_2quxe

4013264,0,t1_crdpapd,Sorry but what is the question here?  im guessing u want my opinion on the trade. In my opinion adding more starters is useless because at a certain point u just end up hurting ur ERA and WHIP and u dont get points for ur margin of victory in the strikeouts and wins category. I hate comparing my team to others cause every team is built differently but as a general rule u want to have roughly the same number of starters as your peers. Another general rule never punt on a category. There is so much deviation week to week in the MLB and fantasy that sometimes even a couple of saves will win u the category. Plus since ur league gives credit for saves AND holds correct me if im wrong Im sure there are players out there that can easily help u out. I believe that getting rid of ur relivers is the opposite of what u should do. U have Kimbrel and AJ Ramos  two solid building blocks. Kimbrel is obviously elite and AJ Ramos is a great pitcher that was just named the closer today. Ik this is kind of long but in short u should reject this deal even tho it is pretty good and focus on building ur relivers. also as a side note I think u should trade Semien hes overproducing and its a good time to sell high same with Josh Reddick,fantasybaseball,crdqrdx,1,t5_2quxe

What if in the th i took Chapman or Lester and then in the th I took Mark Melancon . and Masahiro Tanaka .? I pair up Lester  Melancon vs Champan and Tanaka because thats when those players are being drafted what the value of taking the  Closer and waiting on a SP vs taking a nd tier SP and a nd tier closer.Using the  ProjectionsLester  MelanconIP Strikeouts Wins Saves ERA .WHIP .Chapman  TanakaIP Strikeouts Wins Saves ERA .WHIP .With an equal ADP you drafted two different strategies.

Lets say this right hander has  HRs in  PAs against this LHP over those past  seasons. Ownage right?  Between the dozens of other left handed pitchers he struggles against before match ups with this LHP does the hitter have some special talent or characteristic that helps him dominate this LHP over all the others? If so what is it? Or is it more likely that in that tiny tiny  PA sample size hes just run into a few hung pitches? You wouldnt ever judge a hitter off the first  PAs of his season would you?If so then read this.Sample SizeIt takes at least  PAs for strikeout rate to stabilize and thats the stat that requires the fewest. You can glean absolutely zero information from batter versus pitcher stats that would give you better information than just looking at career platoon splits.,fantasybaseball,crv1qgl,2,t5_2quxe

4207802,0,t1_crzvbcd,Only in one league that uses hitter ks besides points leagues and it works arite. It seems to have a strange effect on player value during drafts as guys like Bruce and Springer go for super cheap and some low k batters have an incredible price tag. That probably has more to o with the scrubs in this league though. There always seems to be one or two teams that boot ks and managers are operating with very different player values compared to other setups. Interesting twist though. And if your offense shits the sheets you can bench your bats and take ks worst case scenario. Dont love it.K adds a ton of value to top tier pitchers. It is a fun cat to play with though since it brings some stud midle relievers into play as well.Yep no such thing as perfect cats. If only it was possible to assign point values to categories.

4297354,0,t1_csa0g9g,Harvey has a slight edge and hes an improving pitcher with better raw stuff. All that coupled with the fact that his path to the MLB has been very normal makes him a tier above Arrieta. Arrieta has atypical past whose  season was slightly worse than Harveys first season in the MLB. And whose  line is comparable to a guy that has been lit up in  starts. So basically Arrieta at his best is comparable to a Harvey at his worst. Thats all weve proved using predictive statistics and ur still arguing that Arrieta is an ace. Not to mention that no where in your analysis do u prove that Arrieta is actually better than Hernandez and plz note that like Harvey his line this year is inflated by  bad starts. I dont think this debate is going anywhere. Its becoming increasingly apparent that the goal of this post was do discredit Harvey and Felix and simply hype up Arrieta has an ace. Arrietas a great pitcher nothing more nothing less but the whole world would agree that Harvey and Felix are better. U can mention predictive stats all u want but even using those which I dont mind using as tools but i generally have problems when people treat them as the end all be all i have proved that Arrieta isnt a ace yet.  Perhaps instead of debating that we should just wait it out and appreciate what Felix Harvey are doing and continue to watch Arrieta ,fantasybaseball,csa19jt,-1,t5_2quxe

He will eclipse  HRs this year currently at  Bats rd or thPlouffe  Cons Low upside you know what you are going to get.

4874386,0,t1_cu8uv84,Since it is dynasty Im inclined to say Vogt. Yan Gomes is a very good catcher. Hes been playing very well over the past two weeks. He also was good last year looks to have turned a corner. Second a reliever. My vote goes to Jepsen. Street RamosCasilla are a solid base and Osuna Rondon are both solid. It looks like Rondon has the closer spot. If you really want to hold on to your relievers Kazmir. Kazmir has struggled as of late but he good be decent down the stretch. However your rotation is ridiculous. It should be able to withstand losing Kazmir.Definitely dont drop Eaton. Its a dynasty. Eaton has good speed and is a potential . hitter or just below that. Hes changed his approach allowing him to hit more HR. Whether that will last remains to be seen. The increase in K rate definitely looks like hes changed his approach. Eaton will score lots of runs due to his above average speed and contact ratescareer .,fantasybaseball,cu8ydni,1,t5_2quxe

No setup man as far as Im aware.Atlantas situation is looking marginally better with Freeman back. Id rather have Doolittle even though he may get fewer saves Oakland is ranked last by a wide margin in my projections but Doolittle is the better closer when healthy which he looks to be.

4924507,0,t1_cuf82ue,You would have to drop  people probably Valencia and WilhelmsenGose if you take the trade. Hamels worsens your teams WHIP but FRod would help balance it and add saves. Im not sold on Wilhelmson but a foursome of Frod doolittle familia and gregorson will be an above average group on RP. If youre looking for a big boost in SB Cutch wont do that but he will make your offense much better and might add  per week. The return of Span and GardnerGose should allow you to hold your own in SB.Overall its really tough to give up Sale. Felix and Richards have begun to implode and I think Sale is too valuable to lose in the number one position. Your OF is strong and should bring you enough SB the rest of the year to keep that category competitive.

It takes considerable skill to outmaneuver the experts in your league and even more luck. I owe far more to VMarts crazy  and Altuve suddenly becoming a top player than any decision I made all year.Commend yourself for always being in the thick of things and never giving up or falling into last place. And dont be afraid to try some new strategies next year  suck at streaming? Try drafting only stud pitchers and chase those ratios. Do you never stream? Give chasing those Ks a shot. Nothing is guaranteed but if you make a team with a certain strategy in mind you might be able to make other owners have to adapt to play you which could be enough to push you over the playoff hump next time around.

5703229,0,t1_cx3wgja,FWIW I am not arguing for Lackey anywhere in this thread.As far as your argument on projections  thats a big misconception. Projections in general regress players towards the mean. That means the regression affects both McGee and all other pitchers. Its hard to reconcile as fans... we tend to think that all players that are good resultswise will always be good. But thats usually not the case and the systems like SteamerZiPS consistently beat handmadeFan projections year after year.For the sake of fantasy valuation the raw numbers for savehold totals are pretty irrelevant all that matters is the relative amounts projected for each player. They are generally projected out at lower values because of what I explained earlier that roles fluctuate. For instance everyone expected Storen to be the closer all year for the Nats in  and look what happened there. Or Cishek for the Marlins. Every time a guy like that gets ousted the thth inning guys fluctuate too. Unless you get really elite secure guys youre generally much better off playing the waiver wire.,fantasybaseball,cx41hru,1,t5_2quxe

6002035,0,t3_3xnrom,Honestly? I would get rid of the NL and AL player pool distinction and open up the league all MLB.If you have two divisions than you have enough teams where you dont have to resort to ALNL only. I dont know how big your league is but you will end up with the same depth in the player pool because the two divisions essentially are a marriage of two shallower ALNL leagues.e.g.  team league  in NL  in AL. This is like two  team leagues which would make sense for ALNL distinction in isolation. But  would be plenty deep enough to open to all MLB.You can eliminate a lot of randomness the unfairness of MLB trades from AL to NL and just make your fantasy league better IMO by destroying the distinction.For tribute purposes you can still call each division the AL or NL but now theres flexibility.,fantasybaseball,cy6eaxa,1,t5_2quxe

6069092,0,t1_cyf3yqh, lt results hereFor a league like that I generally would play for  with a slight bonus for younger guys but not too much   years is pretty short. I added a column here labelled  to show the surplus value for each of these guys Projected value minus cost in .Correas the obvious one and Sale Blackmon Archer and Maybin are all roughly similar value. Personally Id take one hitter and one pitcher from that crew. Sale is an elite player in this format and just might be worth taking over Archer especially if you think your rivals will keep their aces. Otherwise you could keep Archer and use that th rd pick to get a pretty good player instead. On the hitting side I love Blackmon as long as hes still in COL. Maybin was surprising last year but I think odds are good that DET gives Gose playing time over him at some point this year and that he regresses quite a bit as well over the next  yrs.I dont think it changes the calculation much but do you play with long benches?

6132154,0,t1_cylsk5u,I agree with you  that DeShields is every bit fast enough that he should be able to swipe  bags a year. I consider myself a DeShields guy.. I was pretty vocal in support of him on here last year.With that said gross MiLB SB totals dont transfer very well to MLB success. In the minors raw speed wins  times out of . In the major leagues raw speed is probably half the equation which is the reason a guy like Goldschmidt or Rizzo savvy baserunners can steal more bases than a guy like Christian Yelich or Odubel Herrera who are both undoubtedly faster than our first basemen. Im well aware of DeShieldss minor league exploits but dont forget that Billy Burns stole  in  followed it up with  in  and then mustered only  in  attempts at the MLB level last year despite  PA and a solid . OBP. While theres a good chance DeShields sees an uptick in PA from his  in  it cant really get much higher unless he literally is their everyday leadoff guy in which case hell crack . Hes a very patient hitter doubledigit walk rates leading to a very solid . OBP. If he can maintain the OBP and reach  PA he probably stands a chance at  steals... but I would still err on the the lower side. With that said he probably falls more in that  PA range but I also wouldnt be surprised to see his OBP crack . with some extra development... so if I had to peg a solid overunder number for DeShieldss steals in  itd be  on the dot. Long story short we essentially agree but Id be worried if DeShields was one of my  starting outfielders unless I was pretty damn strong everywhere else. Hell score runs steals some bases wont destroy your average and might even help your OBP but he offers no HR potential which can be a tough deficit to overcome. Also Brinsons closer to the bigs than you might think and is their longterm centerfielder. Ive seen the kid play hes pretty special. Mazara is a cornerguy for sure but scouts seem to think hes basically ready for the show. And we know the Rangers FO isnt shy about bringing guys to the big leagues early Andrus Profar Odor Gallo etc.. Just saying getting playingtime in  and  probably wont be a walk in the park for DeShields. ,fantasybaseball,cymnu4p,1,t5_2quxe
6134322,0,t3_3zhpex,Im actually kind of surprised at the number of variations people are suggesting. Goldy Rizzo Arenado Altuve and Salazar. The case against Bautista is trying to hang onto your first round pick in the hopes a more valuable dynasty asset is there plus getting to keep another player Salazar in a later round. Salazar is a more valuable keeper than Cespedes or Adam Jones in this format and is available numerous rounds later.. pretty close to a nobrainer for me.,fantasybaseball,cymwp5u,1,t5_2quxe
6141494,0,t3_3znmve,IMO a true dynasty league keeps  of the players. But if youre keeping the majority of your players its closer to a dynasty than a normal keeper league. Many of the keeper leagues I see in this subreddit actually play closer to redraft than dynasty. So its always a little funny to see people wanting to chose upside young players over older established studs in that kinda format.Heres a hypo showing the difference between keeper and dynasty  lets say youve narrowed it down to keeping Steven Matz vs. keeping Nelson Cruz in a keep  league vs. a straight up trade offer of Cruz for Matz in a full dynasty league.Totally valid IMO to prefer Matz in a dynasty valid to prefer Cruz too depending on team setup league depth and championship window but Id go Cruz by a mile over Matz in the shallow keeper in almost every possible scenario. In keep  or any shallow keeper youre never really gonna have an issue of not having enough good players to choose as keepers. Goal should always be to get the best player availablebest talent and try to win now cause theres still so much talent left in the draft. Dynasty goals on the other hand can focus on the future a little more especially for teams not ready to contend immediately. For teams ready to compete in the present theres usually two approaches  sell the future to try and win now vs. stay balanced and try to have your cake and eat it too try to win now and still be in a good position for the future.As you get more and more keepers though more of the dynasty mindset can come into play. Its like a spectrum. On the far left is redraft leagues keep  in the middle is keep  e.g. keep  of  and on the far right is dynasty leagues keep .,fantasybaseball,cynq2bb,5,t5_2quxe

I like the in week management aspect of balancing ERA and WHIP while making a push for IP and Ks but it has put a premium on pitching as most managers stream pitchers throughout the week and a bulk of benches are comprised with pitchers.

I like Seager but this spot hes st in NFBC removes his value which was always about being a good pick up later on. Little bro Corey Seager goes a few picks later at  overall. I can seethe helium raising Coreys price as we march ever so slowly into March.First closer off the board is Kenley at . Collete and Sporer from Fangraphs take Lindor in th round after already having Correa. I know theres a MI to fill just not sure if I would have worried about it so early on. Six picks in Ciely has no infield. Has StantonBautistaHarveyCruzFelixChapman. Curious to see what he does. Was about to poke some fun at Revere going at the top of the th round but thats only  picks above his average ADP. Damn hes pretty coveted atop that WAS lineup huh?Closer run started halfway through th. Six closers in  picks.

6610364,0,t3_466mel,I did pretty much the opposite.  I know my league has an unusual amount of categories and different settings but regardless good pitching early has always been my key to success in almost every fantasy league specifically Kershaw.  This hurts to say as a diehard SF Fan.  I took him nd overall over Stanton in this league last year and I won the championship. I think I went with Kershaw Altuve Strasburg Lestor IIRC.  Granted I traded Lestor for Ian Desmond early in the season only to drop him and then at the deadline swapped Nelson Cruz for Corey Kluber.My theory is you can find good hitters off the wire more often and later in the season than finding good pitchers off the wire.  I stream pitchers only very early in the season and as I continue picking up the ones that continuously perform the amount of streaming spots I use diminish. When a pitcher performs he stays on the roster.  If you go with pitching early I would only target workhorses like Kershaw Bumgarner had these  in my keeper roto Kluber King Felix etc or pitchers that will most likely improve on previous numbers syndergaard for ex.  I dont like to take risks on pitchers that have had Tommy John recently or didnt pitch less than  innings but is projected to be really good or pitchers that came out of no where like Keuschel or Harvey.  But I havent really looked at ADPs or rankings for this season so Im not considering what round these guys are going in.Anyway sorry this was so long I havent been able to sleep tonight and this is the first fantasy baseball thread to pop up in my feed in quite some time so I was excited to share strategy.

As for who to target at SS Im high on Semien and Suarez who are both being largely ignored in drafts this year. Another option is Ketel Marte who would be a good source of speed for you.I did not see the Giles question! I said this elsewhere ITT but dont put too much value on spring stats.

7005847,0,t3_4bm12d,Stuck on my keeper options. Our league is  team HH. The scoring heavily favors pitching in our league. Example The highest scoring hitters were Josh Donaldson  points and Goldy at  points. There were  pitchers who scored more than the highest batter. Kershaw  Arrieta  Greinke  Max  and Dallas at . Our keeper options get kept at the year they were drafted the previous season. My options Max Scherzer nd round Good but not great value.  scoring player potentialJacob deGrom th round About  rounds lower than his ADP. Another guy who could score more than any hitterAJ Pollock th round ADP of nd round. But will he play as well as he did last year?Jose Fernandez th round We can keep these players in this round every year so this option really intrigues me. Young stud for cheapKyle Schwarber th round Great value but is he worth keeper over a stud pitcher? Dallas Keuchel th round Another stud pitcher but he will most likely regress. The price tag is cheap though. What would your  keepers be? I really like JoFer deGrom and Max and then load up on batters in the draft. But Schwarber and Pollocks price is nice enough to consider. Edit Leaning towards deGrom JoFer and Schwarber. Im nervous about Kyle though. Will he keep his C eligibility? ,fantasybaseball,d1agh5x,1,t5_2quxe

Just going to ignore the fact that Machado has blown out both of his knees and has had major reconstructive surgery on each of them?Stanton had some lingering injuries earlier in his career but you cant hold it against him for getting plunked in the face or the fluke hamate injury. He hasnt earned the injury prone label like a Tulo has  at least not yet.You cant really go wrong with either here but dont base your decision on Stantons injury prone label when Machado has had his share of major injuries.

Specific to Kluber highlight the underwhelming nature of his fastball via pitchfx to support your argument  theres plenty of data to substantiate your argument such as contact rate and babip. You can then extend that analysis to how his increased usage of the fastball last year is what assisted such a considerable regression from his Cy Young performance.Dont just go about complaining at the perceived ineptitude of others.

7173765,0,t3_4drcha,I used to be a huge SP streamer in hh but I found that I was often shooting myself in the foot by the middle of the week. Id stream guys who would put me deeper into ratio holes sometimes adding them at the expense of legitimately good pitchers who I shouldve held onto. See Carlos Martinez last year thought Id be able to dropadd him one more time but he was claimed off waivers after the last hot start I got out of him.Now my strategy is to wait until later in the matchup week WednesdayThursday to see where my numbers are at. If my ratios are ugly and I can make a roster slot available at little expense Ill stream at the end of the week to try to make up some ground in the counting stats W and Ks.Your league scoring doesnt include the ratios but I think a similar view can be applied since the hits walks and ER are still a concern. I dont think Hughes would be much of an asset here since hes not a big strikeout pitcher and he could get knocked around by the Orioles.When I stream now I assume that any pitcher I drop will not be available if I want to pick him back up. It makes me pause for a moment and really look past the current week and decide whether the tradeoff is beneficial in the longterm. In this particular case I dont think the short term add of Hughes is worth losing out on Rodon or Sanchez. Although for the record I myself dropped Sanchez after his great start mostly because I dont have a lot of confidence in him against the Yankees next week and would prefer to have the roster flexibility with the open slot.,fantasybaseball,d1tl8rp,1,t5_2quxe

I targeted him in all my leagues and got him in  out of . He had  HRs in April last year then wasnt the same after hurting his shoulder crashing into the wall in left field. He also looked lost out there which likely contributed mentally at the plate. He looks much more comfortable at first and seems both physically and mentally healthy so far this year and is hitting the ball really well.  That said I see Stroman as an ace on a very good Jays squad. Could reach for  wins this year  Ks and Cy Young consideration. In a keeper league definitely Stroman. In redraft probably still Stroman.

Anything north of . means that a majority of the variance gt  is stable.Im far from a math expert but Im trying to understand more about it. This is something I got from a Wikipedia page about the Coefficient of Determination gt Suppose r. then r . and it implies that  of the variability between the two variables have been accounted for and the remaining  of the variability is still unaccounted for.Its possible that I am reading this incorrectly and I would like to be corrected if its the case.

7481259,0,t1_d2sk6vx,Going from . to . isnt as big a jump for a contact hitter as it would be for a swingmiss power guy in my mind. Dee just hit more singles in  really. PEDs may have helped his speed and made a few outs into infield singles though Ill give you that.Fo Collabello Im not sure... I suspect that getting regular ABs helped him improve as well as anything he may have been on at the time. He has  more ABs in  over  ish vs ish which would contribute to a better plate presence.Braun is also injury prone which I would wager factored in to his PED choices and seeing in the neighbourhood of  less ABs per season post suspension. Also hes in that age group where decline can start to set in as well.I guess what I was getting at is that even juiced to high hell you need to put the barrel on the ball and thats not an easy feat to begin with. Once the barrel is on the ball the extra power youve derived from PEDs would come more into play via sheer force or speed out of the box.,fantasybaseball,d2sks86,-2,t5_2quxe

He was pretty inconsistent his hitting was really streaky but that all could have been because he was getting moved around in the lineup weekly. I forget which coach said it but he said Betts approach at the plate looked like he wasnt ready to hit. But that was all when Betts was  years old on a struggling Boston team in early . The rest of the year he turned things around quite well and people seemed to be warming up to him.

Theres not much wiggle room left for him to be activated in time for most fantasy playoff schedules though.At the same time I think its a foregone conclusion he gets surgery before next year. There arent very many cases of nonoperative recoveries for pitchers and hes been bothered by this for too long. If thats the case you have to wonder if weve seen the very peak  theres a clear correlation between operative lumbar treatment and reductions in career length and statistical performance.I mean for a guy like Kershaw that probably means hes slightly the best as opposed to overwhelmingly the best but its still something worth considering.

8634604,0,t1_d6kdnww,Your dilemma is a tough one.  Sale and Thor are legit keeper options but youre saying that wins are a problem?  Sanchez is a solid keeper for catcher eligibility but I dont think that outweighs what you can get from Sale and Thor.  Its gotta be Sale and Thor in that order I would think.  Gotta see how Thor adjusts in his third year and Sale might get traded if the White Sox have another bad year and you may be in for a good time then.  Even then the White Sox do win a good number of his starts.Edit  Also Lamb is much much riskier.  Hes had one good year and I love how hes been improving but with Pollock and Peralta coming back next year Segura remaining  or  and Goldschmidt still there Lamb is batting lower in the lineup.

So all in all if my opponent has a good relief appearance tomorrow I will probably lose ERA and saves which will put him in the lead. So Im kind of forced to start a pitcher. With DeGrom and Carrasco done for the season I can afford to pick up TWO starters tomorrow could close the gap of  in Ks if Im really lucky. A lot of the starters are already taken Nova Duffy etc. but there are still options! TLDR Who would you stream if you had to pick two of Bauer Pomeranz Reyes Norris Ross Odorizzi etc.?

9044947,0,t1_d7yu8fs,Even though its a small sample size that doesnt mean you cant find something meaningful from it. Since its only  atbats we need to look at one could examine those atbats and look for some reasons why arrieta might hold such dominance over Carpenter. For example if he hasnt been anywhere close to a hit in those atbats then maybe its because arrietas strengths as a pitcher match well with carpenters weaknesses as a hitter. Considering arrieta is an elite pitcher this is not completely out of the question. You can even go farther and look at exit velocities or swst to get a better look at what exactly is going on in those atbats that has led to such a different result than what you normally expect from Carpenter. If Carpenter has merely been unlucky and had some near misses for hits then the picture is obviously a bit more muddied and the best choice is probably to just roll with Carpenter because then it likely is fluky. You can even crossreference those atbats with guys of similar caliber of pitching. Maybe even take a look at his performance and atbats in games that arrieta started but was relieved. My point is basically that just because we have a small sample size doesnt mean that data is completely meaningless. Sure carpenter might jack a run homer and cost you some points. But maybe you grab Brett gardener off free agency for a spot start and he gives you a nice boost for the day while carpenter goes  with a single and a K. You can always dig deeper and maybe you can find some meaning. ,fantasybaseball,d7z23j9,2,t5_2quxe

9502389,0,t3_5axbk3,My top  for  are Posey Lucroy and Sanchez. Posey is a guy that you know what youre getting and hes essentially a given top  C unless something crazy happens. Though I think in a lot of cases hell go earlier than he should just because of the name recognition and the lack of depth at C. Then Lucroy who is a stud himself as well.  HR  RBI both better than Posey this past year. If you want a nearguaranteed top  catcher but dont want to pay up for Posey then I think Lucroy is your guy. Sanchez rounds out my top  despite my personal tendency to try to not buy in to hype until we have some sustainedproven results. However this kid just looks good. With a shallow pool I think he could definitely wind up in the top Touching on a few of the other guys OP mentionedSchwarber Dont believe hell have eligibility at C and I personally dont see him as a catcher in the MLB but his bat is legitdArnaud Not a fan. Cant stay healthy only  year with over  games played not great production when he is healthy. Im avoidingWieters Think this guy is someone that could quietly sneak back into the top . Had a solid year after coming back from injury. If you look closer at his numbers he really wasnt a dud at all last year unless you were expecting top  results. Hes not near the same level as my top  but think he could be a solid option and not cost you a lotMcCann Believe the plan is for McCann to shift to more of a DH role and let Sanchez take over catching if he stays in NY which would be good for him. Should keep his eligibility for this year and getting out from behind the plate should be easier on his body.

9554353,0,t3_5bizdq,As far as true category production like Betts offered this year  Gregory Polanco is the first name that comes to mind. He stole  bases on  attempts in  and was on pace for to clear  pretty easily in  before a knee injury slowed him down for much of the summer. He played through the injury and then made up for lost ground by stealing  bases in the last month of the season.He looked like a legitimate superstar in the first half of the season with a ... slash line that was already starting to decline due to the knee and a shoulder injury. He still finished the year at  HR SB with a ... tripleslash at the age of . Dont be surprised if hes healthy and we see peak Polanco for an entire season. While I wouldnt expect that to equate out to quite as good as Mookies  I think he has an outside shot at hitting  HR and with his lowerhalf at  seems like a lock for  SB and a safe bet for . Call me crazy but I think Polanco goes  with  runs scored  RBI and a tripleslash hovering around ... all season. Others that offer that type of category upside Trea Turner could put up a Villarlike season with positional flexibility David Dahl Drew Stubbs with a much better contact bat? Alex Bregman probably more of  SB upside but I think he puts it all together in  Xander Bogaerts hes going to hit  bombs sooner than later and hes stealing more bases than most people expected Yoan Moncada probably the least likely but also might have the highest pure ceiling Francisco Lindor Im not sure theres anything this kid could do that would surprise me anymore Javier Baez another lowerfloor guy but  PA of Baez with some addl development could mean  potential MVP candidate Addison Russell I dont think hell ever steal even doubledigit bases but I think his biggame HRs in the postseason will carry over into . Still just  hit  HR this year huge RRBI potential in that lineup I think he has an outside shot to go  in  Christian Yelich the ultimate groundball hitter finally found some loft and popped  bombs has the speed to steal  but only managed  on  attempts.. wouldnt bank on it but a  season wouldnt shock me Andrew Benintendi not sure the HR power will shine through this early and not sure how often theyll let him run but hes another guy where a  season wouldnt shock me.. would project him for about . Another guy I could see really catching people off guard is Jungho Kang.. career ... hitter across  PA despite the adjustment phase to big league pitching and catastrophic knee injury in  and then playing through the sexual assault allegations this year still hit  HR in just  PA. Assuming hes innocent until proven guilty and stays healthy in  I think Kangs power is on full display and he hits over  HR and to make it extra outlandish Ill say he flirts with . ,fantasybaseball,d9qrrol,3,t5_2quxe

10498395,0,t3_5qc9jd,Ill take a serious stab at this... David Dahl Top  prospect from .  potential. Plays at Coors. Hit very well in his  MLB games last season. Im leaning more and more toward taking a chance on him depending on how low he falls relative to his ADP. Julio Urias Was rated the top pitching prospect in the game by a lot of publications going into . Huge K potential but also relatively raw. Could be like how  Velasquez was for owners except on a good team and much better. Ws probably wont be an issue since hes on a contender just a matter of what kind of workload he gets. Will almost definitely be on an innings limit. I would probably take a flier on him if he fell low enough and I missed out on a lot of the SPs I am targeting. Thats what happened to me with Velasquez going into  I got him in the th and I was very happy. Alex Reyes Starting the year in the Cards rotation. Will face the best offense in the league a ton. Has had crazy control problems his whole professional career but also crazy K rates. I am personally passing very hard. Trea Turner Will be gone in the nd round. B SS and OF eigible.  hr SB last year in only  PA. Legit HRSB combo threat. Probably the most hyped young player going into  and anyone who doesnt think its warranted is kidding themselves. I personally am not wasting my nd round pick to draft him but I cant wait to see if he lives up to the expectations. Michael Conforto His K rates in the minors werent as bad as they are so far in his mLB career so Im hoping theres hope that he can fix himself. Doesnt steal bases which is a trait I want in my outfielders. Has  grade power but wont see tons of playing time considering the Mets have a crowded outfield at the moment.As far as risky picks I think all of them are fairly risky besides maybe Turner but that risk is more if he can replicate what he was doing  but extrapolated over a whole year. I have very little doubt that hell fail though. Out of Urias and Reyes Id say Urias is the less risky pick because of his makeup what we saw last year over a bigger sample size and the fact that hes already pretty highly regarded. Conforto is an unnecessary risk.,fantasybaseball,dcy3qpm,5,t5_2quxe

10675970,0,t1_ddh3u4q,Except there isnt a reliable trend in that. You provided a game sample of suppressing walks as a game sample. In  of his  starts you cited his walk rate was bad. There isnt a trend in having a BB of . over  starts then having a BB of . over  starts then finishing the season with a start stretch with a BB of .. Whats more you pinned it on usage of his change and you flatout ignore that point when I show his increased change usage in that stretch didnt lead to improved results. In fact FG rated his change quite poorly in that stretch.Your response to pointing out the flaws in your analysis? Cut it up change the measurements and act like you did nothing. That you would call pointing out bad statistical analysis gaslighting is ridiculous because all youre doing is doubling down on not looking at the big OR small picture.It does not make sense to ignore  of Rodons innings in favor of  nor does it make sense to ignore that the  youre looking at is  bad and  good. So youre not really looking at onefourth of the data. Youre trying to focus on solely the positive which is onethird of that onefourth. Youre building an argument on onetwelfth of Rodons work even as it has bad numbers on both sides.And seriously to pick a sample then say my pointing out sampling flaws isnt applicable its just showing a complete unwillingness to have a rational discussion. To pair that with claiming a root the change then refusing to acknowledge evidence refuting it or even try to offer support of the claim is similarly showing that you flatout wanted to just do a driveby feel right and head off. You didnt want to actually have to look into the numbers you claimed lest there be the potential for being wrong.In all of this one side of this discussion has provided analysis of the other sides data. One side has conceded points both for Rodon and against him. One side has both used the simple logic of looking at the whole picture and played the silly game of judging on a small sample. On the other side youve changed your argument from making a claim worth observing whether the increased pitch mix led to better results to looking at increasingly small samples with different data trying to cut out games you simply dont like and changing to ERA and not once actually addressing information that factually disagrees with your claims.,fantasybaseball,ddh59al,6,t5_2quxe

EVERY SINGLE YEAR dozens of people say this is the year Belt hits  and I just have no idea why people still say it.Which is also tied to the original comment that made me do a double take I see VERY few similarities between Bird and Belt who you comp to Bird.

11317470,0,t1_dfet5j2,I do understand all of this. And i also understand that baseball in general takes in to account every aspect of human life. Stress pressure weather teammates and many other factors. Fantasy Baseball is  about stats and points. Simple fact is his second half numbers were well below the first half numbers and I wouldnt take him in the rd round with the other guys with similar ADP still available.

11333459,0,t3_61p1wh,I dont like paying for saves especially on a meh closer who required a lot of luck and especially on a guy that will be suspended for the first month and a bit. You probably could have drafted Reed a lot later got saves from him until Familia is back and by the time Familia gets back theres bound to be a few closer that have lost their jobs meaning you can then drop Reed for some free saves.

11455963,0,t1_dfucr29,Hey buddy. I LOVE The Score. Bountiful options for following not only Teams but also Players across a variety of Sports. Its very very helpful when you want to keep a watchful eye over a player you have on your ESPNLeague Watchlist and are thinking of picking up. Getting that Notification that they just hit a HR will have you racing to the wire and beating others on picking them up.You have full control over what type of notifications you receive and how you get them. For example I work  jobs for  hour workweeks and I love that I can just click my phone on the lock screen and get all the news on my players in a glance and then Im back to working or gaming or whathaveyou. Much easier than having to pull up ESPN Team Page and then try to figure out the batting info or looking at them on the wire. The Score does that for you and sends it right to your lock screen Notification Center.  Pitching Notification Options Batting Notification Options Team Notification OptionsPlus its free. So just download it and try it out. Im a researchaholic and I love it. But you can use it very casually as well. I hope this has helped!,fantasybaseball,dfuix4b,4,t5_2quxe
11458633,0,t3_63jl5t,The Sleeper and the Bust is the deepest and widely considered the best. Paul Sporer hosts usually has Eno Sarris or Jason Collette has his cohosts. Real nice analysis and great perspective from everyone on the show. My only criticism is they do tend to linger on one topic for a while.I listen to CBS often and enjoy it. They cover a lot of players and provide good insight and move quickly through topics. Theyll cover a lot in one show. Some of the personalities can be grating Heath can be a bit brash Chris can be slightly condescending and Scott can be a bit of a bore. A good upside for this one is that they put out new podcasts every weekday.Some people will rag on the ESPN podcast Eric Karabell and Tristan Cockcroft but this is another one i download and listen to. I think its just popular to bust on ESPN these days but this podcast is fine. Both are pretty knowledgeable and introduce good topics to think about. They move the show along pretty well most of the time but Tristan will go completely off the rails  he tries to be too jokey and comes off really nerdy and just plain unfunny and you find yourself wishing theyd just stick to the topics at hand.There are more but these are the main  that i listen to.,fantasybaseball,dfutts9,3,t5_2quxe

Even if Wolters gets off to a hot start when Murphy is out I expect him to regress to the mean eventually. I just dont see any scenario where a healthy Murphy is strictly a backup to Wolters given their respective skillsets. The playing time question is legitimate though.

I would think that it would be something that he has continually worked on since . People make adjustments. People fix things. Look at Paxton last season as he is a prime example. As someone else pointed out Amir topped out at  yesterday when he is capable of hitting . Has he stopped trying to throw so hard to reign in some of the control issues? Whos to say but for now I like what I see. I dont think he wont walk another batter all season but he could regain some control and that could lead to him being the top are in Great American Ballpark. ,fantasybaseball,dg7sl6o,-3,t5_2quxe

But rankings such as this DO affect daily value calculations no?  The fantasy market is pretty much a herd.  Its crowdsourcing at its best and worst.  Dollar values and draft positions are affected by everything from thoughtful analyses to offhand comments by pundits.

But remember that the points league format increase the value of replacement players so dont be afraid to move some of your good players if youre going to upgrade your team overall.  If you feel that you have to find an ace maybe look to move Machado.  Hes an amazing player but b is deep this year and if you get an ace plus a moustakas Castillanos Franco Sano Bregman etc etc package it could be worth your wild.

If youre trying to trade Archer for example Id target rd th or th round hitters you like and send the offer to a bunch of guys in your league.

It is an AL or NL last guy in your rotation type stat line.  Mediocre WHIP mediocre W . ERA with just awful K is not something I want.He is also losing his job for a start or two soon.
