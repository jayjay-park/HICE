Which is cool because im a troll in real life and i love messing with people but this dude was looking down on a homeless lady while I was up in Tallahassee visiting some friends with my fiancee. Saying really offensive shit about the lady. I didnt know he was missing until my fiancee and her friends invited me to a vigil for him down here in sofla.This guy wasnt a saint maybe he pissed off the wrong person.

Not much is being said about how it will affect students who will switch over from the joint CoE to just FSU during their undergrad. Im graduating but can already see that the split is a touchy subject and emotions are high from students and professors alike. What about the curriculum ? Sure FSU can base their different departments curriculum off what is at the CoE now but you have to consider that the new school will likely not be staffed to the extent that the CoE is now right out the gate. ,fsu,ch58vg1,2,t5_2qwzt

5005079,1,t3_3jge7k,Hey Im one of the original members but since Im alumni now I can give you a general idea of who they are as far as Im aware of how it is now. Overall chill and diverse group of guys. Theres the people who go out all the time those who play sports or play FIFA at home something for everyone. As far as Im aware theyre planning on buying the house if possible but currently its being leased from the original owners of lambda chi alpha. Zbt has had it for several years now and they wont give it up without a fight. As far as pledging is concerned nationals outlawed the process in . But to get new members educated about the fraternity they have the journey program where you learn about the history and learn about your brothers. This is fairly different since you become initiated early on in the semester. To compensate zbt also has sbrv a review vote where brothers can be expelled from the fraternity for not following brotherly standards. Essentially the whole goal is to avoid tedious and unnecessary hazing which isnt even suppose to be allowed on campus anyhow. Ultimately I really enjoyed being a part of zbt and I hope that helps. Best time to get to know them is rush week. Ask questions and generally youll get the answers youre looking for.,fsu,cupatey,4,t5_2qwzt

5345438,0,t1_cvtniv7,What is wrong with going to  different universities? I went to  to get an AA then went to another and had to drop out since I almost fucking died and had to finish school online at another. You dont know a a god damn thing about me so I suggest you think before you speak to someone instead of acting like some pretentious judgmental know it all asshole.I get tired of reading all this bullshit about FSU is for everyone and the best and and blah blah blah since that is just a really fucking bias reality. There are programs here that are obviously the top in the country in which you would gain some serious benefits from being a part of while there are other programs that are completely garbage and arent worth anyones money or time. Plus there is just inherited flaws of going to an extremely large university. FSU is not this perfect paradise to where everything is magical and nothing can ever go wrong. Telling people only the good shit is fucked up since its extremely misleading and doesnt benefit anyone. The statements I made are NOT inaccurate whatsoever. Tallahassee is a poor ass town with shitty weather that is extremely unpredictable and is either being on the extreme end of too hothumid and too cold. FSU is literally the economy of the town outside of the FL government stuff. This city is dedicated to education which means that its extremely hard to find a job outside of education and politics. This is why so many people come and go out of the city since its not that many peoples long term destination.Racism is REAL in Tallahassee and and this is coming from a someone who has lived in MANY different places. People definitely treat you a certain way based on your color. Ive had professors grade me a certain way due to my race and bus drivers treat me like shit just because Im white. Racism is still a fucking real thing in Tallahassee due to politics of the past especially once you step outside of FSU but dont be surprised if you deal with it inside the school too.Financial Aid is really fucking shitty here. I had to call them  times to process my loan money. I have never dealt with that at any other school I went to but again that is just part of the problem of going to a school that is really stretching its resources. Also there is the issue of FSU mostly being ran by TAsGAs. How ironic is it that your paying money to have someone who is barely older than you teach you a subject. Not saying that is really the worse thing ever but to act like this is right or it makes any good sense is just being an asshole.But like I said I think FSU is still a good institution in spite of all of this. The school has was built from literally nothing by some really incredible people and there is some things to respect about the university at large. However the school has fucking problems and its better to know them coming in instead of spending a shit ton of money time and thinking wow I fucked up and maybe this place isnt for me. Trust me I wish there was lots of things people told me before coming here since it would have definitely changed some of the decisions I made before coming.,fsu,cvuxucs,-1,t5_2qwzt

8306836,0,t3_4taj38,This is a massive post. Ill try to break it down as best as I can. Dont worry about not being an active smoker drinker or partyer. Im the same way and Ive come along fine over the course of my first year here. Many people like to go out and get wild over the weekend some even during the week but if you arent interested in hanging out with them you can pretty easily disassociate without being crucified for it. There are numerous locations available throughout Tallahassee for student rental mostly because the FSU student population is what gives this city life. I lived on campus for my first two semesters because it was recommended to me by basically everyone I encountered. It gives you an easy way to learn the schools layout by walking everywhere you go and also lets you encounter new friends in the form of roommates. Given that youre a rather shy person from what I gather I can understand you may want to personally select a roommate and live outside of the sometimes intense situation that is the oncampus dormitories. I wouldnt really know where to start for offcampus housing but Id recommend poking around the find a roommate thread to hunt for someone that matches your personality type. Be aware that there are many awful living locations in Tallahassee  as I said FSU gives this city life and if you stray too far from it you end up in the slums. Scope out the location that you find interesting make sure you read numerous review on it and visit it in person before making a decision to sign a contract. Im not very active in organizations on campus but I know there is an Anime club Ive seen their advertisements around which you might be interested in. Theres also the Association of Computers and Machinery ACM which is the primary computer science organization on campus. The people there are very friendly and will likely share many of your hobbies. ACM has a programming contest every semester with prizes group activities and questions for all sorts of programming languages. Favorite professor is Melina Vastola. Shes an excellent professor  Id say she could teach a rock how to code in C and Unix. I havent encountered enough CS professors to have a least favorite but I found Robert Myers to be a rather tough teacher for ObjectOriented Programming. Hes a nice guy though hence me not calling him a least favorite. Every professor Ive had lists their office hours in the syllabus and if they cant show up theyll inform the class beforehand with an email. I personally built my own gaming PC which doubles as my school PC Ive seen a number of students in my CS classes using Mac laptops. Since we use a Unix environment for g compiling and Mac has a built in console that works off of unix Macs can be handy in that sense. However many programs used for development are PConly and may require running an instance of Windows in a partitioned space of the Mac hard drive. For my laptop which I bring to classes with me I use a Toshiba Chromebook  which has a surprisingly fast lightweight operating system. I find Chromebooks to be excellent investments even for programming students. With Googles online pseudoMicrosoftOffice suite you can write notes and make presentations using FSU wifi anywhere on campus. For coding I use codeanywhere an online service which lets you code in multiple languages and save files on the web. For  Id take my Chromebook over a weigheddown slow Windows laptop any day. As for the graphics courses I havent taken any of those  Im working mostly towards C development and maybe PHPCSSHTML if I find courses for that later down the road. If you come from very cold climates itll take you a while to get used to Florida heat. It gets hot as shit during the summer but outside of those three months the weather is a pretty casual  degrees. Im from Miami so Im already used to it although Tally is very humid. No idea about the foreign language placement test. Im just grinding through French. Every professor must list the disability accommodation policy in their syllabus. If you contact a professor via email or in their office hours and discuss what accommodations you need they will likely go ahead and assist you with that. Just this semester a student privately spoke with my professor and asked him if another student could takes notes for them. The professor kept the student completely anonymous and sent an email to the class asking if anyone was a good notetaker who was never absent who would be willing to send notes to said student. Professors are kind and intelligent here at FSU so you shouldnt have any trouble getting aide if you need it.I hope I answered most questions in your post here. Let me know if you need more information Ill be happy to help!,fsu,d5fwt8c,4,t5_2qwzt

And public assistance is not trashy or something of which to be so openly ashamed....but when you talk about it that way it encourages people to continue seeing food stamps as something to judge and laugh at and the world already has enough judgment from rich pricks who think the poor are trashy.,fsu,d7fnkh4,30,t5_2qwzt

9069443,0,t1_d81zqx5,No not a TA I just recently started the program. I wouldnt worry too much. In my experience every class that had a reputation of being really hard or notoriously unfair has really not been the case. Especially with the finance and accounting classes the more you know the foundation material the easier it is to study for and retain the more advanced stuff. ,fsu,d8200nc,1,t5_2qwzt

10262407,0,t3_5mmhvk,Hi there! Sorry for the delayed response from us. This is common for many classes but the best policy is to email the instructor for each class to ask. While many instructors are comfortable with this there are some that have specific preferences. For example there are some that have different syllabi for onlineinclass sections  some prefer specific inclass lecture sections for online students and some who have inclass lectures that meet or exceed the room capacity so online students may be discouraged.Hope that helps!,fsu,dc7astm,1,t5_2qwzt

11018904,0,t1_degxveu,There isnt really a devils advocate here our football program makes us a LOT of money. Were one of the  best teams since we became a team and were the second best team in the last twenty years. The amount of money football games bring to our city during season is ridiculous too. Its a huge boost to our economy. ,fsu,degynbj,13,t5_2qwzt
