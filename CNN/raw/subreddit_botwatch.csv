609599,0,t3_214gjh,Zants has mentioned IFTTT but I run bots for the Yogscast subreddits that do exactly that. usipsbot  usjinbot  uYOGSbot  uzoeybot And several more. You can find an old version of the super simple python code to do it here Or if youd like I could set one up for you they just all hang out on a VPS I use for general stuff.,botwatch,cg9kba0,6,t5_2u3r3

It could certainly be called harassment since the user being searched may not want the history to be known widely.  And although it does sent copy the exact post linking to a users gone wild post that they may want to delete at a later date pretty common  is against the rules.  Even if you want to hide behind technicalities it just feels ethically shady.  ,botwatch,cugjejr,0,t5_2u3r3

7130247,0,t1_d1n92el,You could be right there might be too much for it to look through.  Why dont you try doing this change to the bot so you can leave it running over night.up at the top where the import statements are add this one          import requestsThen down in the main method change line  from          except praw.reddit.HTTPExceptionto                        except requests.exceptions.ReadTimeoutThis should prevent the program from quitting when you get that one exception.  I think you said it was always the same exception you got.  If it turns out youre getting multiple different exceptions let me know and well do something a little more complicated.EDIT formatting and a word,botwatch,d1omnrx,1,t5_2u3r3

Because if its installed in their subreddit they would have to at least know the bots name. Again I did cover this in my opening question.

7943440,0,t1_d3klnur,I know this was from a while ago but I got here from google. Im needing to host a bot that will edit a users tag when it detects a comment that tells it to do so. Would the freetier Heroku handle that? Also slightly worried about the  minute sleep thing but that could probably be figured out. My understanding is that  hours is more than enough to cover constant hourly usage through a month but not sure if thats how it actually handles it.,botwatch,d48x0jb,1,t5_2u3r3

10192541,0,t1_dbbva0o,Thats a flawed argument. Everything costs money. Your computer your time to develop the bot your internet connection...remote servers and all the related infrastructure required for them as well as for the middlemen businesses required to be able to offer you your own tiny slice of a single server for an idiotically low monthly price...etc etc...Want the cheapest possible option? Run the bot on your personal computer. Nextcheapest? Run it on old hardware at your home. Want more uptimereliability? Pay for a service or pay to rent a slice of a server directly VPS.If youre really lucky maybe you have or can find a friend with spare space on a server whod be willing to let you use it for free. Ive done this for various different uses usually web hosting or Minecraft in the past for people with servers I rented for other purposes that had free resources  subject to restrictions and monitoring of course and with no guarantees on service. But theres no way in hell Id ever give someone with your attitude something like that.Actually fuck all that. Want the cheapest possible option? Use AutoModerator instead.,botwatch,dbzdpyv,1,t5_2u3r3
