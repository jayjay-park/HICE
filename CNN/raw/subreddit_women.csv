Being affected by other peoples oppression is NOT the same as being oppressed. Of course oppression affects everyone because it affects society as a whole but there are HUGE differences in the way in which it affects people specifically in their ability to obtain power wealth and status and especially with what severity it affects people. Those differences are anything but trivial.gt This is commonly accepted among psychologists sociologists anthropologists economists historians and many other academic groups.My stepfather has a PhD in psychology he has no idea what youre talking about.

You think this is even one iota your fault because you went into your own basement to suggest to your husband that he should be quieter or the neighbours might call the police? No. No. No. No. No. You did not do anything wrong by going down there. You absolutely did the right thing. My husband isnt perfect sometimes he rages out over stuff. People get mad. Its part of being human. But if my husband starts to yell inappropriately and I point it out and tell him to quiet down he quiets the fuck down and apologizes. Even if hes been drinking. Thats normal behaviour on both our parts. It was okay to tell him to be quiet no matter how you worded it or what your tone was like.   Im so sorry for whats happening. It sounds like its all gone horribly wrong. Getting married right out of college isnt inappropriate you were an adult who was more than mature enough to make that kind of decision. But life happens.

If you go with the copper IUD again chances are you are going to have the same effects as last time. I just had my copper one removed after having it for  years cause my cramps were terrible on it and my periods were so heavy that they would normally last for  weeks and then be gone for  and come back again etc etc. I switched onto the Mirena last month and only had a day or so of spotting after the initial insertion. My period started on time last week and ive had spotting again that is still there but I can use light tampons now or no tampon at all and just use liners. Before I was using super plus tampons and needing to change them every  hours or so.

Its not just that hes trying to remake how she looks but it also looks like hes trying to remake her in general. He wants a wife with more schooling or maybe one who isnt working and dependent on him.Its only been six weeks and he seems like hes working to fundamentally change her life. Hes moving her and her children into his house. Offering to change how she looks getting her to leave her job for schooling. Getting her into counseling thats religious and that hes chosen.

The psychologists who ran the study were saying that.Hence this Salon article about why science is annoying this week.No one anywhere made the argument that women shouldnt behave as capable adults with leadership skills. But there are people doing social science who think women should man up.The point of this article is that seeing men and what is stereotyped as masculine behavior as the default norm and better than stereotyped feminine behavior is the problem. It has nothing to do with women not being assertive enough for jobs and your response is a pretty egregious misread in my opinion.,women,cjkm5ob,8,t5_2qh8d

You start to believe that the birth experience is your chance to show everyone what a Strong Woman you are and what a Great Mom you will be...if you have a vaginal birth without pain meds thats some serious street cred right there! I even had a woman subtly berate me because I was noisy while delivering  apparently its more efficient to give birth silently and of course she claimed she never made even a peep. Theres so much judgment going on and you feel like you have to defend every decision you make and everyone is clamouring after the most epic birth experience so they can feel less insecure. It only gets worse after birth because then you have to contend with women who will tell you that youre poisoning your baby if you feed him formula one woman on a forum I frequented told the nurses that she would consider it assault if they gave her baby formula...wtf? or accuse you of being a nipple nazi if you breastfeed and dare to enjoy it or do it in public. Youll have to justify your choice to use cloth diapers you think youre soooo much better because youre environmentally friendly! or disposables youre not only poisoning your babys ass cheeks with all that bleached plasticy diaper filling but also poisoning the planet! shame!. Whether you stay at home lazy! unambitious! or smug! selfrighteous! or work outside the home lazy parent letting someone else raise your kids! you will be judged. Its endless and its so easy to get sucked down into it when youre a firsttime mom because so much of it is coming from moms who are older and experienced and that makes it seem valid. It makes you lose perspective and forget about what really matters.I felt cheated when I had my csection. That surprised me. I wasnt prepared for that. I was so sure Id have another vaginal delivery even though my water broke at  weeks and I kept going into labour and they kept stopping it and I was bleeding heavily and was basically fucked right up. I was still sure of how this birth would play out. And then they couldnt get labour to stop and I was labouring as hard as if I was  cm dilated but I was stuck at  and my babys heart started slowing down perilously during contractions. It was low enough that theyd have been trying to revive her had she been outside my uterus and not inside it. Emergency csection for me. It took me a few weeks of smoldering and feeling like a failure and feeling cheated of some experience before I smartened up and realized that what mattered was my baby. She was alive and beautiful and perfectly healthy a real little fighter and I was still alive too. What else mattered? But Id spent so much time involved in parenting forums slinging grenades and bullets in the Mommy Wars that I wasnt thinking clearly up until that point.

8680732,0,t1_d6qoj9a,gt My point is that people need to have more regard for the woman who is alive and in the world.Yes but thats just the prochoice position restated again.From the prolife perspective youre arguing that that futurewoman should be allowed to be murdered for the presentwomans right to maximise her medical options.gt So what theyre saying is that in the end that fetus once born doesnt have basic rights anyway. So WHY does an unborn fetus have more rights than the woman it turns into?No theyre arguing that the right to life trumps the right to not be pregnant. Both life and bodily integrity are basic rights but as with any two rights when they come into conflict one of them has to take precedence over the other. You and I choose bodily integrity  prolife people unsurprisingly choose life.Dont get me wrong here  Im prochoice and I dont agree their position mages sense but until you learn to argue from the other persons point of view all youre ever doing is restating your position instead of debating or persuading anyone.For example to someone who thinks abortion is murder whittering on about a womans right to choose sounds monstrous because to them youre taking about a womans choice to murder. Thats a lost debate before you even start.Conversely an actual argument would be to attack the definition of a foetus as a person or to differentiate between things that with the right environment may form a person say sperm and eggs... or an embryo and an actual selfaware individual with a wiredup brain a consciousness and a sense of self.Alternatively you can take their stated principles or priorities to their logical conclusion and show that they lead to dangerous or abhorrent outcomes  for example if they genuinely believe that the right to life trumps the right to bodily integrity they should necessarily therefore agree that the government should be able to compel nonfatal organ donations from healthy people for terminal patients which I think even most prolife people would balk at.,women,d6qpry4,1,t5_2qh8d

But putting women up on this supposed pedestal stereotypes us and takes away the idea of woman as separate individuals. It makes us the other.  It puts our gender ahead of our humanness.
