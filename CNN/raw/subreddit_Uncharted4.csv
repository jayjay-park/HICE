7564470,0,t3_4ixu4s,I was actually just coming to the conclusion that thats my only gripe with the entire game. Its just something thats absent that is sort of a no brainer for any multiplayer I cant see the reasoning behind taking it out. Still great fun though,Uncharted4,d321l2z,3,t5_2z1ex
7597384,0,t3_4jcjod,Uncharted  is a masterpiece not playing  and  will cause you to loose so much emotional weight and context for the story. Please do not play  untill youve gotten through the others. Youll thank yourself in the end. ,Uncharted4,d35s8vx,1,t5_2z1ex
7679848,0,t1_d3ez2jq,Honestly your opinion is totally valid in respect to the grand set pieces I felt more so than any other uncharted game that either what I was playing I had played before  car chase scene or that when it did occur It seemed like I did not have as much control over it more like I was watching it   Nadine fights. Elevator is an awesome scene though.I still think it is wildly successful I ultimately give it a . where it fails is in the fact that in my opinion it is held back by this balancing act of emotional grounding and uncharted grandness when they do them both it is phenomenal but sometimes the balancing seems uncharacteristic of uncharted But I really dig your Bully point and thanks a lot for checking the video out and leaving your thoughts,Uncharted4,d3f5i4u,1,t5_2z1ex

10581112,0,t3_5rcaar,I do too loved the game and its good they put an end to Drake.  I personally didnt want them to keep it going and going then the game wouldve lost its unique touch if you know what I mean.,Uncharted4,dd7cyxt,1,t5_2z1ex
