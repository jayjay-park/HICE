10267448,0,t3_5n0co7,Well the removed all trading nuked the displays at all the disney stores and only do releases at the parks on online store. I stopped buying them once they nixed the trading boxes because that was one of my favorite aspects. The eachez are coolish but theyre  to  each well above my personal price point on a possibility of a duplicate. I would probably only buy open box ones anymore on ebay. The new ones dont even get mentions anymore on their blog or facebook page theyve mostly been replaced by Tsum Tsum which seem to sell in much larger amounts but their  price point is spot on i would own at least x more vinylmation if they were  each.,vinylmation,dc7vdnv,1,t5_2suyq
