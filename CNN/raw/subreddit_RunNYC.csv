3533651,0,t1_cpuuqms,Ive read on rrunning that gait analysis is a little overrated. I just want to try a few pairs and get one that fits well. ,RunNYC,cpv266l,2,t5_2xqvx
3580331,0,t1_cpytece,How do you accurately keep yourself at a set slower pace outside? I am on a training plan that keeps me at a specific pace slow and long at first to build endurance then ramp up speed as the  gets closer,RunNYC,cq0dwrr,1,t5_2xqvx

Although you can look up your bib already.  Yup Im running it. The start line is less than a mile from my house and Ive casually run it for the past two years. This will be the first time Ive properly trained for a half marathon so Im ready to run!,RunNYC,cr4q8rf,4,t5_2xqvx

5360648,0,t3_3odoce,I ran the half last year and again this year. I knew there was a new course and for the most part I liked it but those new hills were pain personified. I had a great first half but as soon as I got off the Boardwalk I blew up hard.  The SI crowd tends to be very supportive and vocal which is great. The only thing this race was I witnessed a situation were some guy was being a real ass. I dont know if he was making jokes or being willfully mean but I never saw anything like it before. If I had his bib number I wouldve said something to a marshal regarding conduct.,RunNYC,cvwvt71,2,t5_2xqvx
5365685,0,t1_cvxefyd,Its so funny most people in this thread seem to have liked the course but it looks like people over on NYRRs FB page hated it... I didt run last year so nothing to compare it to. I know what you mean about not enjoying an out and back as much  less variety in the scenerynot as interesting since you already saw everything on your way out.,RunNYC,cvxizig,1,t5_2xqvx

11221056,0,t3_606q88,If you really are right by ESB theres nothing in terms of uninterrupted routes. Running blocks avenue blocks btw so much less interrupted east or west to either the east or west side paths is your best option. You could also run street blocks so intersections every .mi instead of every .mi up to Central Park do the lower loop and run back that should put you right around mi starting from ESB.,RunNYC,df3w58v,3,t5_2xqvx
