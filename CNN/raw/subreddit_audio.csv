Personal preference objectively it could lead to cleaner sound depending on the ported or unported speakers youre comparing. Its unclear to me whether thats a pair or a single... If its a pair then thats probably a fantastic deal. If its a single then Id stop and think carefully. Compare them to Klipsch Tannoy and Focal equivalents.

Im afraid that may put you a bit over budget and while there are a few cheaper options at W per channel youll be pretty much future proof as it can handle the likes of Klipschs  RF II set.    However to answer your question there is no requirement for wattage. Even a  TAmp could power the FSs but the issue is volume. The FSs have a lower sensitivity meaning they wont get as loud for a given amplification. While I wont go into the logistics of calculating the wattage requirement for a specific sensitivity for a specific room size more power amplification watts is almost always better. In short an amplifier will perform better with less distortion at  its capacity than at .,audio,cmzzr7m,1,t5_2qhms

3062802,0,t3_2v5frv,The best way will be to have your signal path as  Computer gt Valhallagt Lepai gt subwoofer gtbookshelf speakers.    Set the level knob on the Lepai either all the way up or else use it as a trim so that the level of the speakers matches the level of the headphones so that you arent reaching for the Valhalla level knob each time you switch between them. Hide the Lepai behind the desk and it will act as your poweramplifier and you wont need to see or think about it.  That linelevel adapter is intended to go the other way taking loud signal intended for speakers and turning it down to make it a linelevel input. It either does that with a pair of tiny transformers in which case it has poor bass output not good for subwoofer  or it uses resistor voltagedividers which would turn down the signal in either direction.    You probably know all this but just so it is clear for anyone else who searches here to solve their similar problem  The subwoofer has a builtin channel power amp for the subwoofer. There are two ways to get the sound into it   the MONO RCA jack intended to connect from a hometheatre system that has a SUBWOOFER OUTPUT jack that is also RCA.   two pairs of speaker terminals  this is actually really clever as the subwoofer has built into it two goodquality speakerlevel to linelevel circuits along with a means of summing the two stereo channels into  without adding crosstalk making the stereo image narrower or mono. So the subwoofer can tap the speakerlevel signals that continue on to your two speakers and combine them before its own poweramp reamplifies just the very low bass to the subwoofer speaker cone.  So connecting a linelevel preamp output to those speakerterminals would be far too low a volume level to get any meaningful level from the subwoofer would not provide any amplification for ones left and right main speakers and would be driving too low an impedance which would mean that the Valhalla would distort.,audio,cofgfvx,2,t5_2qhms

See items  and  on page .I would suggest using the RCA inputs over the  jacks as the RCAs will be inputs designed for consumer line level which is what a phone uses. The  jacks will be designed for pro line levels which are close but a little higher so if you use the  inputs with a phone the volume will be reduced which wont be good.As it looks like you need to run a separate cable to each speaker I would personally get a short male .mm to female RCAs cable and then two of the  RCA to  RCA variety of RCA cables Or get a single  RCA to  RCA cable because sometimes you can peel it apart into two separate cables but I cant tell from the picture whether that will work.Alternatively you can get male .mm to female RCAs cable and then get an RCA extension cable to reach the second speaker.

4501757,0,t3_3cq8wm,You probably want to stay away from tower speakers and aim for pro loudspeakers. The Bs you found would probably be okay. If you wanted to hook those up to an iPod you need a .mm to XLR cable and then just plug it into the two speakers. The alternative would be a .mm to XLR and then an XLR cable connected to the output of one speaker to the input of the other. The second setup gives you greater flexibility in terms of placement so that you arent forced to keep the two speakers close to each other. Alternatively why dont you just rent a setup? Everything would be  ready to go beforehand and probably would be cheaper. ,audio,csy3l8w,1,t5_2qhms

And then that single wire goes to the eg. front right terminal on the receiver?  Same goes for the other speaker but this being front left.

4601734,0,t3_3dyvm1,Alright So Im guna try and make this as easy as possible to work outA lot of the random noise issues can mostly be attributed to the nature of the cheap hardware you are using. As the saying goes you get what you pay for. You said you would be ok buying another mixer and I would recommend the Behringer XENYX Channel Mixer  which can mix your audio signals properly and will eliminate the random noises. You will need to buy either some adapters for the RCA cables to  inch to plug them into the mixer or brand new cables like these Hosa Cable CPR Dual  Inch To RCA Cable  . Foot Now onto the separate paths issue thing. You said you wanted to set it up like thiscomputer gtspeakers computer gtheadset computer gtspeakers computer gtheadsetHonestly it doesnt need to be that complicated. What you can do with adapters if needed is simply plug your headphones into the mixer and simply turn down the volume for the computer you dont want to hear.

I said that if you step it down to line level where there is already a circuit built to mix the signal then you dont need to worry how to mix it. This is because its already a solved problem there are already left and right line level inputs.gt It is far less expensive to mix at line level vs. speaker level.Hence why Im suggesting that it might be easier to build if an amplified input signal is converted to line level.,audio,cvhuyce,1,t5_2qhms

5379471,0,t1_cvz0lsn,Id skip the external hardware equalizer unless you need it for something else like live PAamplification or your home stereo.  EQ is definitely something you can do easily in Audacity after you get the audio recorded in fact its probably better if you do it in software than if you do it with lowendprosumer hardware.  If you record it through the external equalizer and goof it up youll just need to rerecord it  and digitizing tapes is a timeconsuming task.  If youre doing fixes like EQ or noise reduction you can try different settings over and over again in moments or minutes without losing the work of having recorded it in the first place.  Of course whenever youre editing a digital audio file first make a copy of it and then edit the copy in case either you mess it up or if something goes wrong and corrupts the file.,audio,cvzadhd,1,t5_2qhms
5531962,0,t1_cwihugr,I dont think it could be the UPS or the power outlet as the other speakers are working. If it was none of the speakers should in theory work.The only thing I can think of that would cause the .mm input to not work is if you dont plug it in all the way. That would reverse the signal in one channel making the subwoofer not play at all and the sound coming from the speakers should sound weird as well in that case.In most cases what is causing a speaker to fail on Logitech and other computer aimed . speaker systems is the plug for the speaker with all the controls on going bad or having a loose pin so if you plugged it out and back in again to look at it and it worked after that that is most likely the cause of the subwoofer going silent. ,audio,cwir8x1,1,t5_2qhms
5568291,0,t1_cwmqv5t,The audio source is your laptop or pc. If its a laptop w battery power try unplugging it and see if the fuzz stays or maybe try another source. If it stays then you either need balanced cables or the dac. If it leaves then all you need is a ground lift. Basically a ground loop happens when you are running your audio source and your speakers on a different circuit because the grounds are attached to the main ground at different spots. Since you are connecting the grounds via the cord you got a large circuit which causes a buzz. This does not often matter for home use but in the case of laptops and pcs the transformer that switches the power from ac to dc presents a problem. The behringer hd is pretty cheap ish at least in the USA and works pretty well although it is  trs. Which you can find an  to  trs adapters pretty affordable.

If you were going to try any go wireless you would be much better off with using some sort of RF transmitter or an audio repeater.

8754695,0,t1_d6zy96l,Righteous this makes total sense. So in essence I dont need powerful speakers just a wide array of smaller speakers across the surface area of the room. I am in a ft by ft room now.You could do  speakers with an offset of  ft with three rows  ft apart from the center.  My issue has all ways been listening distance. If I am in the far right quadrant of the room wouldnt the other speakers have to be adjusted? Or is there a way to make the volume sound even across the whole space. Id imagine volume increasing is not the way to go rather to create virtual fields where each row DB rating is based on a set surface area. With all that in mind I mostly likely would want to create a singular listening room in the household and keep it as a studylibrary or whatever your main room is. Then areas you spend less time in you can just  have single speaker for ambience if at all needed. ,audio,d6zztgz,1,t5_2qhms

8947494,0,t1_d7mtji7,Sorry I wasnt really suggesting specific things although one of them could be the problem. I was trying to give examples of things it might be to give you the types of things to think about.A motor or compressor like on a fridge can cause a lot of interference especially when it starts running.  A cell tower may have continuous transmission but a tower with other transmitters might only operate intermittently so if theres any tower nearby it might be the problem. Possibilities people that use strong intermittent transmitters taxis police fire other public service radio stations. Is one of your neighbors a ham radio or CB guy? Walk around your neighborhood and look for antennas.So Im not really trying to give you an immediate solution.

11567084,0,t1_dg7488n,HDMI is kindof in some cases two way.  As modyhead mentioned theres a feature called ARC that allows your TV to receive an audiovisual signal and send the audio to an HDMI device backwards.  This means that if you have the Netflix app on your TV it sends the audio back to the receiver to get amplified and sent to the speakers.In my personal limited experience ARC is not perfect.  Youre probably best off getting an inexpensive HDMI receiver using it as the hub rather than the TV and using the TV purely as a display ie no sound and you never change the TV input you select the input on the receiver instead.  Youll have inputs into the receiver and it will send video to the TV over HDMI and analog audio to speakers over paired copper wires.  Further your TV doesnt leave much in the way of expandability.Grab an inexpensive HDMI receiver something that has like  HDMI input ports and  output port with channel sound.  Get passive speakers for the front and center channels maybe get wireless for the rear or just run cables and get passive speakers youll get more bang for your buck.  If you want to get fancy grab a multizone receiver and run the rears off the second zone or put them in another room and play music while somebody else watches a movie see Onkyo TXNR or similar.  Im not saying wireless speakers are bad but theyll consume much  when your sound system could be way better with wired speakers.  You can get reasonable value by buying those boxed . receiverspeaker systems as long as they have the connectivity you need.,audio,dg74uip,2,t5_2qhms
