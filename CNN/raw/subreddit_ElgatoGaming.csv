4649065,0,t3_3e3aiz,That happen to me once or twice generally if I run the software when Im still in consoles main menu and than start the game and the resolutions change there is some hick up due to loading or when I have it connected to my PC for a long time and than try to use it. My general advise is to keep it unhooked most of the times and before toy start recording connect and disconnect it once and run the software once its a bit more awake. Also just in general start recording once the game has already started.,ElgatoGaming,ctgksn2,1,t5_2y5jw

6467621,0,t1_czo308a,Alright you might be right it may have something to do with the CPU. Im using the Elgato HD I was recording fps and live streaming so I was using around . Mbps theres no problem with the TV because basically its just a mirror from the TV right? I dont know what the Bitrate is and Im really not sure what it is either.The elgato however is used thats how I bought it but Im fairly sure thats not the problem but I could be wrong maybe the elgato wasnt securely connected and thats the reason why I could be getting that. I dont know what encoding preset is though.,ElgatoGaming,czoaq9q,1,t5_2y5jw

7488737,0,t1_d2t0kbf,Theres definitely a spare PCIe slot as I had a look in there when upgrading the ram. Im not sure on editing as ive never really done much before. The only thing I can say is that im a graphic designer and it handles jumping between Photoshop and Illustrator with big files fine.I havent got a dedicated GPU at the moment as ive never used it for gaming and dont plan to now. Is this necessary for streaming and capturing?Thanks for the help! ,ElgatoGaming,d2tfgij,1,t5_2y5jw
7601422,0,t1_d368nxx,Stream command is working fine on my Mac and it is letting me add overlays and different scenes etc. as of now I have my logo and my webcam up. So its not an issue of compatibility because I am up and running. The issue however is that I am not able to customize the settings of the webcam or picture I am using and on the elgato website showing off the new beta for Mac with stream command it has a section for adding webcams and pictures and also discusses the settings button in the lower left hand corner. The settings button is missing for me. So Im assuming its supposed to be there since its on their site. ,ElgatoGaming,d368r8i,1,t5_2y5jw

7715281,0,t1_d3j688x,Yea I can hear it. For your audio clips see if you can record with Audition and live com in the Elgato software at the same time so I can then analyze the exact same audio. ,ElgatoGaming,d3j6aqw,1,t5_2y5jw
7981175,0,t3_4og8uu,Whats funny in all of this is my Mac actually works better than my PC. Yeah. Go figure. But Im also just using an elgato hd so... its probably a little outdated.

8061900,0,t1_d4m5ljg,Okay I didnt know that. To be fair I wasnt really looking at GPU encoding as a feature. I more so meant things like new stream command features sound capture etc.The fact that GPU encoding is missing isnt because you are running it in Bootcamp its because the power isnt there. You could build a PC and still not have that feature without Apple having anything to do with it.With that said I am getting saddened by how much Apple is crippling the Mac. They used to be top of the line in specs especially on the Mac Pro and now they are getting updated less and less and getting less power when they are. I dont want these thin portable computers. I want an old Mac Pro case with top of the line CPU and GPU options. Sadly my next computer may have to be Windows.,ElgatoGaming,d4m8ee5,1,t5_2y5jw

9000609,0,t1_d7tp7yt,Ah I didnt notice the last caveat here most people in this sub Reddit have Elgato hardware already.The delay wouldnt really matter I wouldnt think since youall be playing on your phone and simply recording to Elgato. Quality is pretty high for all of them depending on settings. I even find the old Game Capture HD to be more than adequate.If you wanted to try other options first though have you given this a try,ElgatoGaming,d7tqf89,2,t5_2y5jw

Save the file change the extension from .txt to .batThen drag and drop the elgato .ts file over the bat and it will convert the video to mp.

11058426,0,t3_5xkd15,gt I understand that the HD has an onboard x chip would enabling the Software  BuiltinGPU do anything?For streaming it would enable the x software encoder. For recording it does not make a difference. gt Again I understand the the HDs uses your CPUs x chip for encoding would enabling the Software  Builtin ensure it only uses the CPU to encode and not the NVENC encoders of the GPU?When using the HD S the computer does all the encoding so in this case Software means that x is used for recording and streaming. ,ElgatoGaming,delgdac,1,t5_2y5jw
11215508,0,t1_df33yld,I understand that. And thats the minimum requirements. It could vary greatly when you start tweaking with settings trying to get the best set up. My question is how different.

11496273,0,t1_dfyuqd7,I dont know that much about Elgato myself just yet Im still learning. If youre talking about the game audio then I have no idea as I have yet to have that problem. I have noticed that when I am doing commentary that my responses to something ingame comes out  seconds delayed but thats because Im using a usb microphone headset. Theres still a slight delay with commentary feed via analog but its less.As to ingame sound being out of sync when exported I think I remember a friend saying how he had that issue with an older version of Elgato. If youre using an older version of the Elgato it could be that but Im not sure. I have the Elgato HD myself.,ElgatoGaming,dfz3ofs,1,t5_2y5jw
