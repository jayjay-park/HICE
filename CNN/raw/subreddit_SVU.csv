742328,0,t1_cgom93x,Hes always wanted to inflict as much pane to his victims as possible and in the case of Olivia there was nothing more he could do. Olivia needs to live with the fact that he killed himself in a world where people arent going to be  sure he actually did. This of course is going to have some crazy ramifications next season.,SVU,cgonozb,2,t5_2t476

3659077,0,t1_cq74qsv,Why is it a problem though? Is anyone being hurt other than possibly the reputation of these kids? And couldnt they hurt their reputations in any myriad number of ways that the government wouldnt lock people in jail for? Again it comes down to what do you think the purpose of prosecuting child pornography is. Is it to protect children in which case kids taking pics of themselves does not necessitate anyone protecting them or is it to protect their reputations which I would argue is not the role of government or is it to punish people society labels as deviant because they look at naked pictures of kids even those the kids took of their own free will again something I dont think the government should be doing? Answer that question please.,SVU,cq9cz85,1,t5_2t476

3690166,0,t3_32mb8d,Oh man I feel your pain. I used to watch most of my TV as repeats and thus lack closure for so many stupid two parters or crossovers. With that said have you checked your local library? They might actually have the DVD so you dont have to buy it. I just checked and my library does. Maybe if your librarians are Law and Order fans theyll have it too.,SVU,cqcwiz0,3,t5_2t476

6704698,0,t3_470pla,The episode where Olivias babysitter suspects something at a friends house. Then Olivia goes over and gets taken hostage. I was so on edge the whole episode. It was so stressful. All the guns waving around. And then the one perp raped that girl. The episode was already so awful. Listening to the rape was just over the top horrible. And then he gets shot at the end! Olivia was pretty badass in those final moments. But it pissed me off that he wasnt going to have to pay for his crime. ,SVU,d0cto0y,2,t5_2t476
6922018,0,t3_48o7gn,Everyone is talking about Liv and Tuckers relationship and how that got her transferred.Think about it. If they found out she wouldve lost her shield. Not be transferredI think Chief Dodds transferred Liv to allow for Sgt Dodds to be promoted to Lieutenant. It is what Big Dodds wanted for Lil Dodds. We all saw how pissed she was at Lil Dodds at the end of the episode,SVU,d10xnr0,3,t5_2t476

9414436,0,t3_59j77j,Im in NYC have watched since the early days wish I could help you out. They film near my school all the time. A lot of people I know like the show bcof strong characters and familiarity and also ripped from the headlines stuff. ,SVU,d99cg4f,2,t5_2t476
9555621,0,t3_5bexl5,I love Olivias character progression and feel that Stabler at times held her back. He was not going to progress with this behaviour and attitude in the show. Iv watched it twice now I do miss some of his moments but they where at a price of the story line. When he left it opened up a lot more character storylines and entertainment. As one of the longs running law and order series and all the cross overs with Chicago PD I felt that if he was still in it the show would not have lasted. I know thats a big statement but thats just how I see it. ,SVU,d9qxdmy,5,t5_2t476

10030521,0,t3_5jbvi5,Amaro has been referred to as good looking and guapo several times. But it doesnt really compare to how people treat Amanda. But it probably has to do with the fact that most of the perps are men? Idk...,SVU,dbf05vn,8,t5_2t476

10322254,0,t3_5nmtx9,Music has to be licensed and the theme song was not for a number of years. I know the versions in France of law and order had completely different music and credits when I first came over it freaked me out. I think new credit sequences were created for export. Later years it was all homogenized ,SVU,dce31nm,1,t5_2t476
10706276,0,t1_ddk9j7y,Yeah I definitely noticed that they recycle actors which is totally fine but also super strange to me. I think Kelli Giddish was a rape victim in one of the earlier seasons. Thats the only other one I can think of.,SVU,ddk9tn6,2,t5_2t476
