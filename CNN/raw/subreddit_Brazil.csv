The Third World was normally seen to include many countries with colonial pasts in Africa Latin America and Asia It was also sometimes taken as synonymous with countries in the NonAligned Movement In the socalled dependency theory of thinkers like Raul Prebisch Walter Rodney Theotonio dos Santos and Andre Gunder Frank the Third World has also been connected to the world economic division as periphery countries in the world system that is dominated by the core countries.gtgtImage i  The three worlds as they were separated during the Cold War era each with its respective allies as of the period between  April  the fall of Saigon and  August  the communist takeover in Laos.

1106333,0,t3_26scf0,The current mainstream music state of affairs in Brazil is not so good at least when it comes to my personal tastes. There used to be really good rock bands here in the s and s with really unique styles. Some of them are still active and relatively popular but currently whats being pushed by the major recording labels and consumed by the majority of the population is in my opinion basically garbage.Heres an overview of the trending music here in brazil right now Sertanejo  Sertanejo is a style somewhat similar to american country music but with slightly different thematics. Usually sad stories about guys abandoned by their wifes Traditionally sung in duos mostly by male singers popular examples include Bruno amp Marrone Chitozinho e Xoror Leonardo used to be Leandro e Leonardo but Leandro died in an car accident of cancer years ago Rionegro amp Solimes. Their target audience is mostly adult females.  Sertanejo Universitrio  A spinoff of Sertanejo targetting a younger and slightly more educated audience. The name literally means University Sertanejo. Usually sung by young and handsome guys the thematics of the songs are usually about how successful they are in life now They have cars women flock around them etc. An example would be Michel Tel. Funk  Not the same as what is known as funk in the US. This electronic music style most defining characteristics are a strong beat use of weird samples like car horns and other bizarre sounds and monotonic but shouted vocals. The thematics are usually the life in the favelas ghettos and being a badass gangsta. Originally played on massive ravesorgies known as baile funk in the favelas. Even though Funk started with the lower classes of the favela it now appeals to a much larger audience.  Funk ostentao  A spinoff of funk appealing to a much younger generation.  year olds. The singers are also teenagers who usually record and edit the videos themselves and share them on YouTube. The thematics are usually about showing off how you can afford expensive swag from famous brands even though you live in the ghetto. Even though the style itself is not appealing to me right now this is IMO the most interesting thing going on with music in Brazil because its an almost entirely organic but massively popular movement produced by a younger generation who is very familiar with the internet and social media and who doesnt understand or want to put up with the slowness of the older generation. They are known for organizing massive meetups with thousands of teenagers overnight rolezinhos in random malls or public spaces and want to claim social recognition for their families and communities even though in very weird ways e.g. by idolizing foreign clothing brands. Ax  Beach party music very upbeat usually sung by female vocals like Ivete Sangalo and Claudia Leite and played in parties and outdoor music festivals. I consider this style passable and sometimes even enjoyable in the right setting i.e. in a beach or pool but otherwise kinda uninspired. Pop  In the recent years a couple pop singers have appeared copying the style and presentation of american pop singers like Lady Gaga Katy Perry and particularly Beyonce but with strong influences of brazillian funk. Most notable example is Anitta.Styles that were more popular in the past and that I consider more interesting include Bossa nova  A mix of samba and jazz very soothing and slow paced with well thought poetic and sensible lyrics about every day things. Popularized in the s. Classic examples include Tom Jobim Vinicius de Moraes Joo Gilberto Mayza and Nara Leo. MPB  Brazillian Popular Music Started in the s influenced by Bossa Nova. Characterized by a very lounge and chill feel. Thematics were mostly centered on profound but veiled criticism of the military dictatorship we had going on. Classic examples Milton Nascimento Caetano Veloso Chico Buarque Gilberto Gil Marisa Monte e Maria Betnia. A couple more recent examples Maria Gadu and Ana Carolina. Brazillian Rock  Popular in the s. Influenced by american and british rock. Lyrics have various thematics including politics social critique youth life among other things. Examples Legio Urbana Cazuza Capital Inicial Ultraje a Rigor Tits Paralamas do Sucesso.Were also very open to international music. Id say  of what me and my peers listen is international.,Brazil,chu1pmn,26,t5_2qmku
1111445,0,t1_chtwpvr,To sell the condo it will be needed authorization from the judge who will oversee the estate to protect the rights of everyone involved specially the minors. If everyone agrees it wont take that long if if there is an heir who doesnt agree it can takes years but most likely not the  years. The judge will appoint someone to oversee the assets and that person under the guidance of the judge will be able to pay taxes and other costs and sell minor things but the most valuable assets like the condo will need specific authorization from the judge. Someone also will be appointed to defend the rights of the minors in cases like that its usually their mother or if this is not possible other close relative. The rights of his partner will depend on if she is considered his commonlaw wife or not. Note that the requirements for that in Brazil are complex and not very well defined a judge will decide if they intended to constitute a family. Its very hard to know the chances unless you are a family lawyer and know every detail but if they lived together she will probably won the brazilian law was written with the goal of protecting those women.,Brazil,chumoca,2,t5_2qmku

Youll also find leftwing parties which tend to be more extreme and think of Marx as a form of illuminated being that created a perfect theory  which will work eventually somewhere when properly applied.

2875647,0,t1_cnuyb67,I agree but you cant deny that Brazilians are not the most well mannered culture regardless of the setting. Brazilians always cause a ruckus which is one of the great things about our culture. People love interactinghaving fun with other people but it looks poorly when taking to the next level. I dont think misbehaving is the right word hence why I didnt use it. But being annoying and a tad obnoxious is very much a common trait when you combine a group of Brazilians. I also I agree that this isnt Brazilian only trait. Teenagers in general act the same way regardless where they are from. I think Brazilians stick out more bc there are so many of them traveling to the US in recent years something that never happened before. We arent necessarily used to traveling abroad at least not historically. This will get better with time. But like I said its not just us. Same for any group of youngsters. We just happen to stick out more due to the sheer number of us. ,Brazil,cnuymyq,4,t5_2qmku
