219995,0,t3_1wm852,I will wager that  of those arguing that the defense needs to be looked at or recalculated are also players that are outnumbered in players or Level  portals. Or both. On the other hand if all of the aggressors in those situations spoke up with we think defense is just fine Id wager you be right back down to even.The only true advantages one can have in the game are external Numbers of players transport access etc.    With a lack of an overall objective in the game with few foreseeable ones coming the only true win anyone can experience is by keeping a crazy strong commitment until another player quits out of frustration. That win is selfdefeating mind you. as with no enemies the game will grind to a halt. Play the game enough farm enough get off your ass and walk enough  any higher level player can take out anything. In that sense Everyone is even.  I believe the game has been structured that way on purpose. If it took    guys to take out one level  portal the game would slow to a crawl. How long does it take  players to deploy on one portal? days to weeks. Getting  guys together at the same time to take out one portal? Damn the game would stop dead  once something went L that would pretty much be it. It would just stay like that until once or twice a year if a big Op was planned. I digress. TLDR There is no disadvantage in defense. But rather the team in your region is either outnumbered or they dont play enough. You have the exactly same advantage as the other team. Get more players and farm some more. Thats what they did. ,Ingress,cf3i4hl,1,t5_2vij9

314964,0,t3_1wm852,I agree with the general idea and this certainly is a very nice alternative viewpoint for considering the issue. Thanks!However you seem to define offense as anything that anything that advances the score and defense as anything that prevents advancing the score.Of course as they are words they can be defined to match whicever concept the speaker wants. But I dont think that definition you use maps well into what game players of any game would consider offensedefense.My definition would be more something like this Defense is any action that attempts to keep the playfield state created by friendly player actions. Offense is any action that attempts to modify the state created by opposing player actions. This definition also has to include advancing or building or somesuch which is any adjustments to the playfield state to achieve a goal.Please note that this is just discussing the definitions. Whether Ingress is a game that can or should rely on just offenseampadvance mechanics ignoring the defense mechanics is another matter to discuss.,Ingress,cfdeygw,1,t5_2vij9

Edit She didnt know that she had uncommon chromosomal sex until she hit early menopause when she got her chromosomes tested. Have you had your chromosomes tested? How do you know what your sex chromosomes are? Then theres people with androgen insensitivity who are born with penises they are raised as boys and often feel like boys... and then they grow breasts at puberty. Biological sex in relation to chromosomes is not simple.Trans people whove had surgery and take hormones and live their lives without anyone knowing theyre trans cannot actually change their chromosomes so theyd be being asked for extremely personal birthsexdisclosing information which could put them in danger.Im not sure Ive made it clear but it cant be said enough. Chromosomes ie biological sex has nothing to do with gender which is a much more significant piece of information in surveys. If people want data on GPS games in connection with how people live their lives and present themselves to other players and nonplayers chromosomes could not be less relevant  but even if it was there are a dizzying number of sex chromosome configurations aside from XX and XY,Ingress,cg4qsx4,2,t5_2vij9

Thats a massive flaw.gtBonus levels have been discussed for over a year and it hasnt happened yet.They have happened. We dont need the number to change to know what someone means by L.gtIn my opinion bonus levels really bring nothing extra to the table at all. In fact it only points out how daunting it is to get to the next level and that would potentially alienate me much more than a prestige system .m AP is much more attainable than .m or .m.gtI honestly dont care about any of the platinum badges because they are set so high that its not even worth me getting excited about.Games arent meant to be easy. It would just be patronising if there werent things that were actually significant accomplishments. There are a few players who have achieved most platinum badges and are well on their way to onyx. Yes onyx is out of reach for most players and platinum is a very high target but an active agent would be able to reach platinum within a year or so of play for most badges and gold is definitely something that everyone can target.gtDoing the same thing over and over again makes the game stale to a lot of peopleIsnt doing the same thing over and over again literally the entire concept of a prestige system?gtI look at the L G Community my area has and there are so many people who have grown tired of the game and quit playing. This is not unusual. Ive moderated owned and participated in thousands of communities many gamebased. You will never see anything have zero member turnover. At best youll retain about  of membersusers over the course of a year.In any isolated system entropy can only increase. In short people get bored of doing stuff. This is not a problem in and of itself the only reason it seems like it is because Ingress is a more social game than many others.Seriously I see threads like this on a daily basis. Imagine if people started talking about how Angry Birds needs a prestige system every single time a user got bored! Its absolutely ridiculous.gtTLDR My idea is meant to be another way to spice the game upIt completely fails at doing that though. What youre doing is saying that the current goals are too high and then introducing your own system that completely destroys the entire game again how the hell are you meant to make an L farm when people are resetting for prestige? and with the justification that because the numbers are smaller its somehow easier. No its not the numbers are smaller because the achievements mean less. You complain that getting . million AP is too difficult but getting  prestige would be just as difficult and that would be considered as equivalent of an achievement. You cant say that its because of a finer gradient either because you could just count AP in millions instead of in powers of two.If I played actively I could get an additional prestige level every  or so hours. Gaining a prestige level would mean very little and only major prestige milestones     etc would be considered an achievement. These major prestige milestones are nearly exactly the same as the bonus levels in that theyll scale exponentially and be just as difficult to get.It just seems like youve resigned yourself to the incorrect belief that youll never get achieve any of the existing achievements and your solution to that is to devalue any achievements so that theyre easier for you to get. The problem with that is that if theyre easier to get noone will care about them.So in summary It ruins the levelbased game balance and makes agents useless to their faction when they reset. It doesnt add any extra challenge it actually devalues achievements. Its meant to stop people from doing the same thing over and over again despite you still actually having to do that Its implemented in a way that completely ignores immense amounts of work by prolific agents despite that data being there.Yes its nice to have additions to a game that keep it fresh but when it completely destroys the entire basis of the game ignores previous contributions and doesnt solve the nonexistent problem its trying to fix its not something any sane game developer would do.,Ingress,cgk9u25,-1,t5_2vij9

Use a program to keep your phone from locking youll be scooping up XM at a prodigious rate but only if your scanner has its screen on. Change the proportion of looking at the screen to looking at your surroundings When we walk with our scanner on a lot of times were staring at it and paying minimal attention to our surroundingssometimes it can lead to running into things.  If youre moving around  times as fast as you walk when youre biking then youll naturally have less time to react.  So if you need to do a rolling hack or need to take your eyes off of your surroundings for an extended period you will want to slow down enough so that you can see and avoid hazards in time. Wear Sunblock if youre out during the day Sounds silly but making fields during the day will more than likely burn youwe cant always stand in the shade while resting because the portal that we need to be near doesnt always let us do that. Bring a lot of water You may find yourself out longer than youd expect and so youll want to be able to maximize your reaction time and muscle endurance. Bring food Once again you may be out longer than youd expect and youll be burning more calories than youd expect. Bring your battery packsolar charger While bringing along more power is obvious if youre out during the day for an extended period youll have your screen cranked up and youll burn through your battery fasteryoull find yourself running out at the worst possible times when playing Ingress.  So the obvious answer for most scenarios is an external battery pack.  However a solar charger will do quite well during the day since youll have power as long as the sun shines provided that youve got a charger with a high enough mAh and voltage.,Ingress,cgv81qj,8,t5_2vij9

I guess Niantic Labs had a doh moment and decided to extend portals in that city. My buddy went from  approved to  in a matter of hours....It depends on what cell Niantic is reviewing. Typically they will review portals submitted in cities being hosted for events but ever since the new levels and the stupid seer badge they get on average from one person who works there k submitted a day most of which are repeats or bot spams.They should just get rid of the seer badge and put something else on there.

I dont think that needs to go beyond L.A L player can still take down a L portal made by a L player. And a single L cant recharge against it unless they had L cubes.

I heard that spamming Ls was easier on your XM pool or was it bursting out of portal attack range? shrugId have to disagree with tossing Ls. Ive been in multiple situations where due to nonideal circumstances Ive ended up being assigned to hold multiple portals with  people. Having the Ls made keeping the  resos of the portals full much easier due to the deploy limits on higher level Resos. The idea is to have at least  people per portal but people are people and when that comes to pass you end up holding a sculpture garden with only  other person D. ,Ingress,chma9hf,1,t5_2vij9

1085770,0,t1_chreikv,According to the rules its cheating which is the only excuse some people need. The owner believes if youre willing to accept the consequences you can play however you like. Which justifies every form of cheating However in this case the website owner says he simply enjoys fiddling with available data. Data that only helps the green team coincidentally enough but on we go.  Once that site hit reddit the other day the owner changed the layout to make it look like a resistance reminder page... Which not only screams guilt but only an idiot would think was a legitimate idea. Its only intent has ever been to take out resistance guardian portals.By the sounds of it the site has been around for some time. Loooong before the new levels. So when it was set up guardian killing wouldve been simply a way to get under opponents skin but effectively wouldnt mean anything. However I gather players that use this site to guardian snipe may not take into consideration that destroying a guardian now has a ripple effect. Which means theres strategic actions in taking them out. Or not.  When it comes to killing a portal If that badge disappears another one steps in line. So where it used to be ha your guardians gone!. Now it might be  your guardians gone.... And... Youre about to destroy  resonators in a row to...get a ..platinium....shit... The owner of the website should update the page with a disclaimer that says with the introduction of new levels killing a guardian is no longer an empty but really fun victory. Be advised you may inadvertently launch a new style of play from a player as that player will begin chasing a different badge. Pick potential victims wisely.,Ingress,chrpd4v,3,t5_2vij9

1628013,0,t1_cjkd3nr,I wasnt really going to get into it but the short version is it seems only a few very specialized people like the change. Those who only care about badges and levels those who are new and only for the first week or so and those like yourself in purely one sided dominated areas. Though for you I present the argument that has anything really changed? You still have your farms and if the blues really tried to put up any kind of real resistance see what I did there? and build anything surely you would smash it. Their victory is hollow at best. Soon theyll realize that and youll be left with nothing but gray portals. If at any point you want to create more competition locally there are better ways to do it. A few of you could change or you could choose to just let those portals decay and let the smurfs not only capture but link before you smash. It will take a team to decide this. Dominance feels great and it should. It means youve worked hard but eventually it gets stale and  day decay isnt going to fix your problem like you think it might I fear. ,Ingress,cjkdjl0,0,t5_2vij9

Along with the limitations of the mediums inherit geometry there is also the issue of available parts in the appropriate colours especially in your personal collection.

2382025,0,t1_cm63ats,Ingress APK Teardown ..  Welcome back to another Ingress teardown. For those new to Teardowns we simply compare the previous release .. to the current one .. and note the differences. You would be surprised at the amount of changes that go unannounced or simply hide in the APK for an upcoming release. With that outoftheway. Lets dig into ... Changes on Changes  Usually a new version has around  files changed. This is because Proguard the obfuscator used for Ingress shifts the naming of variables among the source files which causes quite a lot of false alarms in the diff reports. As versions have come out my tools have become smarter at handling this.  .. changed all of that. We are looking at a newer iteration of obfuscation and a bit more effort into hiding whats in the APK. Directories shifted locations and even Unicode variables were added to just relocate data for the purpose of obfuscation. This can be seen overall via the diff report of .. compared to ... files changed  insertions  deletions  This is a huge diff report. On top of a new obfuscator version new versions of the internal Google Play Services JSON Parser and libGDX have been included. This seemed like a version to just update all the dependencies on. New Item EXTRASHIELD  There are a few files I watch when looking for new items. This time I was quite surprised when I saw a new item named EXTRASHIELD. Usually when items are in development like Capsules their entry in this file includes a human readable name and a description. Like EMITTERA  Resonator. In the case of EXTRASHIELD the value for the human readable string was null along with a null description. This is probably because Niantic is getting tired of teardowns revealing information before they can so they keep the descriptions blank till such item is ready to launch. An image was included for this mod but the image is completely blank.  The sound appears to say AXA Shield. Thanks to Morgan Jones we have a video of the item which confirms our guesses.Android Wear?      An application requires an update to the Android Wear app.      Update Android Wear      This app wont run unless you update the Android Wear app.  It is quite possible these strings are added in the upgrade to Android SDK Build Tools . Im not sure however the strings are in the APK regardless. So I thought I would mention it because it might actually be an extension for Ingress to Android Wearables.   Ads?      Allow Ad to store image in Picture gallery?      Allow Ad to create a calendar event?  Once again these strings seem strange because there is no picture gallery or calendar in Ingress. Yet the strings are there. So just reporting.   Google Wallet  In App Purchases ?  There were some unique references in the colors to      rescolorwalletprimarysecondary.xml  Along with the following layouts      Theme.IAPTheme      WalletFragmentDefaultStyle  and the string  Buy with Google  With a new item possible ads and wallet. It makes me wonder if this new item potentially plays into our wallet. Im really reaching there but all these features were added in this version so they could possibly be connected. Then again this version was completely reorganized code wise. Its quite possible the code base is shared among other mobile apps Endgame and the changes dont directly affect Ingress. Nitty Gritty Knobs  new enableIOSGridPhotoViewer  deprecated enableIOSRecruit  deprecated enableIOSPortalDiscovery  Built November  Obtained November    Conclusion  A new cycle of development has started for Ingress. Code has been reorganized dependencies updated and a new itemchange is coming. Development seemed to have stalled with nothing but bug fixes since the release of missions. Its safe to say active feature development has started from our point of view.,Ingress,cm64k4b,4,t5_2vij9

Link fully deployed portalsMake fields wherever you canHack opposing teams portals for easy APMod friendly portals but for the love of God keep link amps to yourselfSubmit portalsSubmit new pictures for existing portalsAs you level up find portals within your level range and start killing resonators. Real damage begins at level . As far as finding portals check the Intel map from any browser. I suggest creating a link to the Intel site on your phone for easy access. The easiest way to level up is to join one of your local communities. People in your area will be more than happy to help you level up as it ultimately helps the team to have more lvl players in the area. Enjoy your new addiction!!,Ingress,cnfoefw,10,t5_2vij9

Only if theres nothing to destroy nearbyKeep Keys from Portals you visit every day so you can recharge it remotely. In addition to that also keep Keys from Portals you link regularly.Keys from places I will not visit in the near future get recycled.Capsules are pretty usefull for key management I have a capsule with keys from portals I recharge every day so I dont link to them accidently.I also have another one with Keys from places where I had a good time When youre participating in an bigger OP capsules are very usefull as well put every key in it you dont need in the OP so you dont get confused or link to the wrong portal.,Ingress,cnqvhmn,2,t5_2vij9

Want an example of a skillbased game? Starcraft. Or if you want the same but in a macroscale Guild Wars. The difference is simple if I dont have free time to play Ingress I can have all the skills in the world and it wont matter  unless said set of skills includes altering the timespace continuum  because I cant be out there and play. On the contrary if there is a single player who can spend  hours a day playing Ingress the skill of his  opponents who can only play h each wont matter as long as he has time  simply because they cant do anything he cant nullify given that he has more time  and probably more resources. They cant outskill him.

Yes this is annoying but it keeps the server load under control when youre linking.  Itll definitely break that remaining section and splitting the empty chevron doesnt seem to reliably fix it.  Whats more annoying is when you do this  theres some Nianticspecial code that now has an incorrect list of whats involved with one or more portals and the problem will merrily continue to manifest until someone strips the damaged portal white.

After I took this high level portal over with my puny L xmps some other guy upgraded the resonators and I got my first guardian badge a couple days later.

4136894,0,t3_382gg7,There are two ways to make layered fields    Max Layer Method Pick two portals as anchors. For these you only need a key to one of them. Find  apex portals. Normally these will be in some kind of straight line but as long as the links from them to the anchors wont cross itll work. Farm  keys to each of the apex portals. Go to one anchor and link to the other anchor then the  apex portals. Go to the second anchor and link to the  apex portals making fields as you do so. For this method I prefer to make the biggest field first then work in.Max Of HoweverLongYouFeelLikeFarmingAnchorKeys Method Pick two anchors that you dont mind farming the heck out of. Find your line of apex portals. Since youll be linking out of each apex a maximum of  times and theres no limit on links going into the portals this can be as many as you want. Farm up keys to the anchors. Youll need as many keys as you have apex anchors plus one more. Link the anchor portals together using the portal you have the additional key for as the target portal. Starting at the innermost apex portal link back to both anchors. Work to the next furthest apex and link back to both anchors. Optionally at this time you can also link back to the last apex which will create two smaller bonus fields. Repeat until youre at the end.Really the way you do it should depend on how easy it is for you to farm keys for the different portals. Also the first method listed can be done very quicklyeasily by two agents one standing at each portal and can be synchronized so that you split the APMU fairly evenly. I do a lot of solo work in my fields so I tend to stick to the second method as its pretty much quietly farm keys make sure theres nothing to block the links then just go ham linking back as you run in a line.,Ingress,crrtp7q,9,t5_2vij9

Is there something I have to turn on outside the game to make it work? For the first four levels playing this game I didnt have Use GPS Satelites checked under my androids Location Services. It was only using wireless networks to determine my location so it kept bouncing me around. I almost gave up playing assuming my cellphone was too old or something. I cant find a setting to make the dynamic compass more dynamic tho. I appear to be stuck with static compass no matter what i do.

5066198,0,t1_cuwkh78, It is definitely impossible to defend against a determined and wellstocked attacker. The goal in defending a portal with mods and links and recharging is to make it less easy for the attacker so that hopefully he runs out of bursters andor cubes before he kills all of the portals you want to keep alive. Just a few links and a couple common shields can make someone use x as many bursters to kill a portal as if it were without defenses and keys and common shields are easy to come by! plus you get ap and badge progress and the satisfaction of knowing you at least made life a bit more difficult for your enemies. imo you should save force amps and turrets for level  portals though andor use them on a cluster of portals that no one will hit incidentally while killing something else nearby. They are cool in theory that they cause massively more zap damage forcing opponents to eat cubes and slowing down their bursters spam... but in practice since they only modify the base zap of a portal they dont do much on lower portals which have shorter zap ranges and lower zap damage. Plus these mods pop off very easily and a lvl  player can easily knock them off with bursters before they are even close enough to get zapped back,Ingress,cuwo2fu,1,t5_2vij9

5389064,0,t3_3ou7zy,gt Farming gear is just a necessary evil. It gets in the way of capturing MU and playing the game. So going out of your way to destroy enemy homeportals when theyre high level is a dickmove.A necessary evil? Maybe for some. Personally I enjoy farming. I like glyphing I like seeing MUFGs full of VR mods I like knowing I always have AXAs or virii or enough USbursters to get something done when I want to.That aside there are no such moves in the game as far as it relates to the other team. Theyre the opponents and it is not against the rules to hunt a guardian or blast a farm or scud a BAF OP. Killing a couch portal is especially NOT a dick move imo because why the hell would you want your opponent to benefit from that? Especially if its not a benefit you get to enjoy yourself?,Ingress,cw0ihv4,1,t5_2vij9
5395246,0,t3_3ou7zy,You have to look at the amount of effort that has gone into the portal vs the amount of effort you going there requires.  If its directly in your path take it out no matter what and do the same with every portal you come across that time and gear allows for.  However if its out of your way do some calculations.  If only the person who livesworks at the portal has deployed on it and theyve only put down rare or common hack mods or no hack mods you are definitely losing by going out of your way to go there unless theres a particularly high amount of fields coming off it and you want the AP.  You would get a better return for your gear and effort if you look elsewhere and critically all you are doing is giving your opponent very cheap AP.  If they find your visit annoying theyre an idiot because its far more to their benefit than to yours.  If people have visited and upgraded the portal then the amount of effort youre putting in is equal or less than the amount of effort your opponents have put in.  In this case its worth taking down the portal because theyll be forced to put in that same effort again so youre trading your effort for greater effort from your opponents.  The time they spend upgrading is time lost playing in other areas no matter how much they play.  If very rare hack mods are on the portal or its been levelled through multiple Jarvisada take it out no matter how many people have visited.  VR Hack mods have drop rates of  nonglyph hacks and jarvisada .  They will definitely not get this many hacks from the portal so you taking it out mean they have wasted their gear for a smaller return than their investment.  If they keep doing the same thing they will run out or they will have to spend a greater amount of time hacking than destroying your portals.  In summary take out the portal when it means the enemy has put in more effort to the portal than you will have to taking it out.  Dont take it out when you will be putting in more effort than the enemy.  Being a dick doesnt come into it.  If you take it out being a dick but it was more effort for you than the enemy youre actually helping the enemy.  If it was more effort for the enemy than you youre doing the rationally best move regardless of what the reasons were.,Ingress,cw1aww2,1,t5_2vij9

5713129,0,t3_3tcxzz,This came up at a cross faction meeting hosted by a Niantic programmer about  years back and at the time he indicated that the idea had been brought up in development meetings a couple of times and always would get vetoed because the Powers That Be had data from industry studies and their own testing that showed that the app had to be as visually interesting as they could make it to get players to keep coming back to play it after the initial install and run.  ampnbsp  When people countered and suggested that it be a setting that defaults to visually interesting but can be adjusted if the player wants to the response was three pronged   Adding options to software increases the chances something will break. It went unsaid that this is Niantic were talking about those chances are plenty high without extra help. Having two different versions of how the user interface looks could be potentially confusing because any documentation or new feature announcements would either have to have twice as many screenshots or leave one or the other versions out. Also there would be the confusion factor when a fresh recruit having been told about this awesome game by a veteran player loads it up for the first time and what they see on their screen doesnt look at all like whats on their recruiters screen. The Niantic rep did also point out that he knew wed just tell them to switch to the performance setting right away which would mean the OMG This is SO Cool! factor theyre trying to go for to help hook someone in for the long term wouldnt get a chance to take effect.

Level  can be used on top of the portal and they will hit all resonators...  amp  can hit multiple portals in an area and while the damage is lesser they also have a chance of stripping mods.The idea is to use the right level of bursters to hit the maximum number of resonators and portal centers.  This way you maximize your damage and likelyhood of stripping mods...  Since lower level bursters are easier to get depending on your supply they are easy to spam and replace... saving the higher level ones for more dense locations or for those times you cant reach the resonators etc.For a nonshielded campfired portal all resonators near the center I dont waste my high levels...

One day I go to hack one of the portals and the glyph game screws up royally.  I dont remember exactly what happened but it threw me.  I tried to continue but whenever I tried to hack that portal it reported that it wasnt hackable it was in cool down or some other mysterious reason why it wouldnt be able to be hacked.

The rollovers occur at the time of your first hack in the streak.So if you hack just after your rollover on Day  skip Day  entirely and hack just before your rollover on Day  youll be good.Ive also noticed that it is always a hour period regardless of things like daylight savings time. So if your rollover was at noon during DST it would rollover at  AM when on standard time then go back to noon when DST is on again.Using this knowledge Ive managed to narrow my window to between  and  PM PST or  and  PM PDT. I signed up around this time and have had my streak active since the beginning so I cant tell which theory is the one Niantic is using.

You would visit static locations like portals that would be same for all players on the map.This is where the similarities would stop though. Ingress is pretty involved if you want to level up and do well. It has definite competitive nature to the game. And the PvP aspects are not for everyone.I imagine several AR games that can be much more casual. Not necessarily Candy Crush IRL AR but something that more people would immediately find accessible and fun!AR games will be a thing of the future.

Usually honest player understands that it is in her interests to meet and proof her honesty.

The docents at the lighthouse are all volunteers. This isnt the kind of place where you can casually wander in after closing time sticking around while the docents are asking people to leave is an obvious annoying act.A few months ago Res tried to delay leaving during a portal battle and the docents yelled at them. We would like to avoid this since its a nice lighthouse and the docents are nice and we think it would be good to be able to continue playing Ingress there.

The cell scoring mechanism rewards this behavior however. Obviously since winning the score means more than everyone having fun in a video game this behavior will go unchecked. never mind that it is just for bragging rights and nobody gains anything for winningThis game is predicated on who has the most time to spend playing. Those players are typically the ones fielding over areas and cities for this purpose. casual players dont have the abilitytimewant to go drive  minutes or more out of town to destroy things.

8046103,0,t1_d4kcig2,Users really dont have the ability to analyze the data beyond how Outgress presents it which isnt presented in a stalkerfriendly way.  Its not like the users can query the data directly there is an option to dump raw data for the users to do what they want with it or analyze it how they see fit.On a side note I actually did a little poking around on some local agents where I know where their home portals are to see if it was able to make that determination.  While not an exhaustive check on every agent it knows something about I noticed something with the data... its showing that the most attacked portals by agents as home portals of OTHER agents.  Which makes sense really because Outgress agent tracking is purely based on attacks and as a player you tend to attack other portals more than you are attacking your own portal.  You might retake your home portal but unless every agent that capped your home portal is feeding data into Outgress you end up with a data set that skews you away from attacking your home portal.  But when you attack AgentOutgressFeeders home portal every time you attack that one it logs that attack.Best I can tell in realworld use it tends to put you in the right city but away from portals close to your homework.  Thats not going to be  the case but Id say Enl tend to live in green areas and Res tend to live in blue areas so theres going to be less for them to attack in the immediate vicinity of their homework.  Certainly not alway the case but statistically speaking as far as attacks go.For me as an agent it puts me at the next city over as my most played in area which is the case because my area is pretty green so not much to attack here but I get lunch over there a lot.,Ingress,d4kgi5q,2,t5_2vij9

The journey to L is really just teaching you the basics of the game mechanics ensuring that you learn the value and limitations of each items level before you are exposed to the next item. Once you get to L you then have the challenge of what to do with them. For example you can no longer win outcomes just by having higher level gear than your lower level opponents. Chances are that many  maybe even most  players will still be a higher level than you still able to defeat your actions apparently easily. How do you respond? How do you turn the tables?

So we couldnt all put our pokemon in and there was also  guy from another team who could not do anything at all xD. But I dont have many friends living nearby so its just the people I meet while playing.

My highest is like  or something and the rest is below . Only have a few above . I feel like thats low for my level but I am barely capturing any pokemon because there are not so many they often run away if I move too far from their spawn point and about  pokemon is weedle rattata or pidgey which are not so valueable evolved although  pidgeots are among my best pokemon xD ,Ingress,d6sahmv,1,t5_2vij9

8929896,0,t1_d7l6vmn,Agree something is definitely going on there. Regarding soft ban in general...Ive been playing for . years and got soft banned once a few months back. I used to think that if Im just playing normally soft bans wont happen to me. On that day I was happily walking not driving through Googles Mountain View complex working on a mission capturing and glyph hacking portals when suddenly my XMP bursters started doing no damage and I couldnt deploy. Contacting Niantic only got me canned responses. The soft ban lifted automatically exactly  days later and as far as I can tell to the minute. By coincidence I was again on the Google campus playing when the soft ban lifted.It wasnt even close to my most intensive gaming sessions I estimate that it was under k AP per hour. I didnt change phones. I only log in with one phone. There was no excessive drifting there was no speed lock I was walking there was no spoofing Im not running a custom ROM Im not using a rooted phone Im not running any other GPS application other than whatever Android location service runs in the background. I was on cellular data and theres excellent signal strength. Heck I wasnt even running IITC. Since only Niantic knows and Niantic never talks about it I figure itll always be a mystery to me.Thankfully that was my only experience with getting soft banned but Ive been a bit jumpy ever since whenever I get back a hack acquired no items. Because I know it can happen to me even when playing normally.The only good thing from being soft banned is that I could work on my glyph hack points without worrying about inventory overflowing.,Ingress,d7l8pq3,5,t5_2vij9
8934093,0,t3_52nl70,Maybe its because those are Niantic sanctioned accounts.  ??Do you remember this being a problem before CMU and the store existed?

And people freaked out?  oh no no those were just fan made images used on accident.  mmmmhhmmmmmmmmmmmThen the store comes out with rather mild wares on sale.  ....and also the spam accounts for xmps and AXAs ramp up.  You savvy?  Thats not spam.  Thats how you create a paytoplay store in a hostile market.  Whales are gunna whales the rest of us can turn our noses and Niantic turns a profit.  I mean you cant hack ADAs right now and the price of ADAs in the stores hasnt changed in response?  You think guys running hack bots and spoofing that black market gear arent going to gouge the fuck out of you when even they cant hack them?  mmmmmmhhhhmmmmmmmedit  And what about all those cease and desist letters to the PoGo rd party sites?  hmmmmm???

9177845,0,t3_560fdc,I think it really depends on the number of portals you have access to at any given time and your willingness to walkdrive between them. I think the following guidelines apply The more portals you can access in your cluster the less heat sinking you need.  The more portals you have the less multihacks you need. The more inventory you need to replenish the more multihacks you need.  The more easily you can setup the farm the less defensive capability you need.As an example in the Vancouver Mountain View Cemetery farm theres about  portals. They get common multihacks shields rare or common and no heatsinks. Set up a driving team and youre done in  minutes.In your example I think that configuration is best if you have  portals to hack. I know I hacked a cluster like that and I was only occassionally running ahead of the cooldown.EDITAlso remember that your defensive mods will not stop anyone from taking it down theyll just make it more time consuming. And given that these are Ps theyll be farming the equipment they need from your farm.,Ingress,d8fcxkf,5,t5_2vij9

I play that way most of the time but If I need gear of a certain level its easier to call on some friends for bumps.Also if you get  players lvl and higher together you can make a farm to get high level gear.Heat Sinks and MultiHacks are great for your home portal. Theyll let you get more hacks in more quickly which translates to more gear.Branching out into other areas is good too! You get medals for capturing unique portals as well as hacking new unique portals. Plus you never know you might want to toss a big field!,Ingress,dalgqzw,10,t5_2vij9

Two things that spoofers and cheaters in general wont have issues with. On the other hand legit players with no technical background or spare time end up locked out the game for no reason.This is specially true for any device that lacks CTS compliance comes with unlocked bootloaders or prerooted from factory as is the case with some Chinese manufacturers. Root doesnt mean cheatingspoofing. Unlocked bootloaders dont mean cheatingspoofing.Neither does aesthetic system mods. Screw that.Pd Im all for heavy security measures where is due like banking apps.

10660105,0,t1_dderhu4,Im sure that was one of the reasons certain medals came into play at all. The game used to only go to level . When medals were initially added with the exception of literally  players after well over a year your black guardian was pretty much required for L lest you grind away for another year or more. Guardian hunting was HUGE then because cheaters could effectively keep someone from reaching the highest rank. Once annual medals came in and passive medals like the recharger walking badge etc the guardian badge wasnt required anymore so lots of people stopped giving a shit about it.,Ingress,ddfibmu,2,t5_2vij9
10662320,0,t1_dde6p4i,gt I am working on reaching out to the local players.Thanks for doing this. This is definitely going above and beyond to find a peaceful and productive solution to help both the concerned property owner and the players.If you reach out to the local RES and ENL communities theres a pretty good chance they will want to cooperate with local law enforcement. In as much as organised Ingress communities have any control over players we try to get them to behave better and to cooperate with police and so on.A little side story Im in the UK and this past weekend I was in Cardiff for an Ingress mission day. An Enlightened player decided to chalk the Enlightened logo around the city. I saw this and initially I was just mildly amused. I checked the Hangouts chats and see a lot of very concerned people saying that it is wrong to graffiti even just with chalk and a few people asking the locations of the graffiti to go out with wet wipes to clean the chalk off. They wanted to do everything they can to keep relationships between the Ingress community and the police city and community good so that when we had events in other cities we could cite the success of the event in order to get other cities to sign on for big organised events. Our community tries to be responsible and selfpolicing if we find out who chalked up the city we will try to hold them to account. From now on other Ingress groups will likely try to teach newer players that going around chalking up local businesses isnt okay.A second side story after this incident someone got mugged while out playing Ingress. The organisers shared this information with the rest of the community as soon as they had told the police in order to try and help other people avoid the area where the player had been attacked. We look out for each other.Third side story in the same weekend an Ingress player stopped playing and was late returning to the meetup because they stopped and gave CPR to someone who had collapsed in the street.We look out for each other we try to do good and we try to selfpolice our overenthusiastic idiots and help the policeemergency services when theres a crime.If you do get in contact with your local Ingress community about this generally they will do their best to publicise the issues around that portal to players they know. That wont stop every player not everyone who plays is also part of the organised player groups chatrooms message boards Reddit etc.there are lone wolf players who dont know about their local communities are just visiting dont want to participate in the social side may not be welcome or may have some kind of social anxiety or disorder that makes it hard for them to take part in the organised social side of the game.One thing the players can do is if they are told that using a certain portal late at night is off limits is message players on COMM to tell them that its disconcerting to the property owner that people are using that portal so much.Ultimately local players cant control whether a portal is therethats up to Nianticbut most will try and do what they can to guide their own communities to tell them certain portals are offlimits at certain times of the day. We want to have fun but we dont want to make the lives of local people miserable. In fact it is a point of pride for some Ingressers that while Pokemon Go players caused a lot of anxiety and problems for their local communities we were subtle undertheradar and didnt cause trouble.,Ingress,ddfqjmb,5,t5_2vij9

10692203,0,t1_ddf6112,Im gonna second this one. Im about  million away from L its taken around  months and the only times Ive ever gone out just for AP are when I hadnt played much for awhile and it genuinely sounded like fun microfielding in cemeteries is actually fun if you are a nerd who likes maxfielding!Also its always fun to knock out an opposing multilayer field.Dont get stuck feeling like if you cant dedicate an hour or  to ingress that your efforts will be wasted. I read never did the math myself that an unclaimed portal is worth about XP even without linkingfielding  resonators  mods and a glyph hack. If you never did anything but fully deply grey portals and you did  a day it would take you roughly  years to hit L. Thats a long time but for almost no effort at all. Up that to  portals a day and now youll get it done in just under  years again without ever throwing a link or field without ever attacking the enemys portals without ever recharging a portal etc. Obviously you need badges etc and no one wants to wait   years but Im just making a point do the small things when you have an opportunity. Going to the grocery store? Take that block detour to deploylinkfieldsmash. Going to a big city for the weekend? Thats right take a bunch of resos with you. Those little things done day in day out will really help.Edit I did the math. Assuming I didnt screw it up XP is for fully deploying a modding the resonator without a glyph hack. A good glyph on an L friendly portal is worth another . This lowers all estimates by .,Ingress,dditljf,2,t5_2vij9

10853121,0,t3_5v30yw,Thanks for writing this up.  You make some good points about the fundamental nature of man. Lol.  One thing I noticed right away is that when you make a suggestion realize not everyone knows how to accept advice.  Or perhaps they are seeing the bigger picture and know your suggestion doesnt quite fit.  The point in that case would be that they need to let you know that your suggestions are valued.. or at least they should be open safe communication. If your ideas wont work well in this case they might offer an explanation as to why in a private message.  If they like your advice they should tell you and let you know if they can implement it give you credit for it involve you if can.  This is all just typical people management and not everyone knows how to do it while still maintaining order or influence.I want to bring up the point that you said youre not allowed to say no.  Being able to say no any time without having to explain yourself is exactly what the nearby agents were doing who said they couldnt come assist you on your mission.  Perhaps you shouldnt have been lied to but you shouldnt place them in an obligation you yourself are trying to deny.Needing assistance to add to the fun.  It sucks that you cant have both that and stay out of the larger community in your area. Regional flow can change through time or from location to location. Have you considered playing only at anomalies? Or playing in an online fashion to build friendships and skills that way?  Have you tried taking a month or two break?  You tried some other methods which is awesome but didnt solve your dilemma.  It sucks you had to give up for good.I also hate the ownership or pride of the game.  I completely understand that one needs to be aware of their surroundings before completely destroying their own teams hard work. But when it gets to the extreme point of control  do what I say or else because this entire area belongs to me.. thats just silly.  They dont actually own anything.. they simply play there.  The way they demand respect from you you should be receiving some from them.  Open communication verses delivering orders.. they have no innate right to tell you how to play and they should accept that.When a teammate labels themselves as an enemy by taking a direct action against me thereby preventing or destroying some effort I have committed in order to benefit me or my team in a malicious way.. they are no longer my teammate.  From that point on they are now my opponent no matter what color they claim to be.  It easy to continue playing my game while thinking of them this way.. it alters my methods and keeps them at arms length and on my watch list with no hard feelings.Well anyway if you want to discuss more sounds like a fun discussion.. just pm me.,Ingress,ddzf82v,1,t5_2vij9

In others the occupants own the thing entire thing jointly in common. Not as common to be sure but common enough. In both cases everything behind the gates is owned by the same single legal entity not a multiplicity of individual ones.

11398577,0,t1_dfnmv2y,It wasnt a random person it was the owner and he drove out on his tractor. I was just in the parking lot which is open to drive in.. but he was complaining about people going inside. And its not a blue dominated legit farm take a look again.. currently its mine though the portal in question is sketchy  its slightly reachable from the road but you have to get out and walk a little towards his property to reach it completely. The blues using it know he doesnt want players there but continue to use it anyways causing tension and thus why Im suddenly trying to remove them take your ill informed sass elsewhere.,Ingress,dfo0ilf,3,t5_2vij9

11477159,0,t1_dfwtspk,no they were resistance links we may have reused them to make links after tearing down the other portal they were connected to but no way to know for sure I tend to keep around  keys for portals we commonly field off of,Ingress,dfwxk0n,1,t5_2vij9
11481367,0,t1_dfwrrsw,Safe pedestrian access could also mean once you get to the portal. I interpret it as it doesnt matter what you need to do to get to the portal you just need to be able to walk SOMEWHERE within range of the portal. There are many portals on islands near me that I cant personally get to because I dont have a boat. However I do know that they mostly at piers or parks on these islands that you can very easily and safely walk around at once you get off your boat. I could be wrong on this interpretation but I see the merit behind it. ,Ingress,dfxes7m,1,t5_2vij9

ENL capture and start dismantling ADA. ADA refactors disapear from portal networkVia Lux Res wins and restores ADA somewhat including ADA refactorsVia Noir ENL wins and prevents Olliver Lynton Wolfe from activating some ultratechnology that would have been ultrabadFateOfThe Shards Determining which lore characters contracts will be renewed for the next round of storytelling.  ENL could eject Res leaning researchers from the Magnus in favor of more ENL leaning researchers.Ingress . Because RoboVM which is the backing for the iOS version is shutting down Niantic needs to rebuild the entire app on both platforms so that they can continue releasing updates.  Should be the same game just cleaner and more visually interesting.,Ingress,dg5sjk4,8,t5_2vij9

11680771,0,t1_dgjwqc4,It doesnt have either of them. How do I setup twenty different chats all grouped together with common management? You dont. Yeah you could manually copy the same settings to each one but thats tedious as hell especially if you need to change something after setting it up. With discord you could change the settings later in one spot And how do I send someone a voice message and have it automatically play on their phone? Like if theyre driving from one portal to the next and I need them to hear me without them having to touch their phoneAs for faults of Telegram I know a lot of people who refuse to sign up because of the weird requirement to give them a phone number. And I was quite disturbed when I signed up and several people I hadnt talked to in years were notified that I had an account now just because they had my number still. Talk about a major privacy issue And speaking of privacy they talk a big game about encryption but theyre consistently rated one of the worst encryption schemes in chat,Ingress,dgk15xu,2,t5_2vij9

These are some titles of mission badges for example time to walk the muffin quarter. I did find a site that lets u look up banners but not all are part of a larger banner. It would be nice to be able to figure out how to get the badges I like the pictures of with out having to tell someone Im stalking their profile especially if they are not on my side.,Ingress,dgsnxol,1,t5_2vij9
