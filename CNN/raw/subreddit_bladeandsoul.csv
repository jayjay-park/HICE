An easy solution would have been Now that gamescom is done we need to stress test the game to help us determine server usage ect. After that we will be opening CBT to founders packBeta invite members to explore and give the team feedback.

5195978,0,t1_cvbv4os,the problem with this is that the current system tells other players who is friendly and enemy by the outfit they are wearing. So if you cant see said outfit due to a purchased costume or something then you dont know they are an enemy and thus have no clue if they are flagged. It would be a huge pw boost for PvP players.Also the flagging system allows people to opt in at their leisure if you split all the PvP players onto one server the PvE players will pretty much never have the option to PvP since all the PvP players will be on the other server. The opt in would be completely pointless. With the current system you have to have everyone together on equal servers.,bladeandsoul,cvcb57l,2,t5_2skd6

BM not lyn BM is the tankiest class in the game and generally regarded as the main tank in raids or party dungeons because of their iframes and the impervious block skill.honestly aside from the really powerful skills your block can virtually...well BLOCK anything. Use it abuse it love it sleep with it keep it by your fastest trigger finger at all times.Using block will also build your combo orb...so yes block is an ESSENTIAL part of blademaster gameplay.,bladeandsoul,cvx6d1n,1,t5_2skd6

Ive read that its Unreal Engine  causing it but that doesnt really make sense to me since theres other MMOs running on that engine that work completely fine.Im guessing the game is just really poorly optimized. One way to tell this is by checking your CPU and GPU load. It should be fairly low. A well optimized game uses as much resources as it can while a game that isnt well optimized will stick to something around  GPU and  CPU load. It should definitely be much higher than that though.,bladeandsoul,cw38l9s,1,t5_2skd6

It brings their margin of error slightly up when you have an ability with a quick CD that can essentially cancel a misplay. I am not saying sins do not require skill as they are in the top  hardest classes to play but it is not worth mentioning them for needed a very low ping to perform well.   They do not have the meleerange parry that must be activated within .s of an attack on a s CD like KFM and FM do.

Try log into arena with a premium user and a regular user youll see their attack is completely even even though the Prem user have the  attack bonus. And before you start spouting about world PvP sorry but those were never meant to be balanced to begin with the sheer fact that you can get zerged AND gear matter make it impossible to talk about balance in those case in the first place.And dont talk about sell cosmetic and shortcuts this whole conversation started BECAUSE they complained there wasnt enough in the Prem bonus to warrant buying it. And to me minor PvE stat boost is an actually valid bonus to give since its small enough that it doesnt even matter yeah  when youre stacking  against a fucking mm HP boss that gotta make a huge difference right? not skill at all right? but it still give the illusionfeeling that its giving you something.Do your research before getting on your high horse PLEASE. ,bladeandsoul,cwrj0w6,1,t5_2skd6

I played with the settings for over an hour tried to run it in compatibility mode for Windows  messed with my catalyst control center.... nothing could get that game to run over  fps and for the most part it would be in the s. In comparison I could run Final Fantasy XIV which looks significantly better at over  fps. Hell even Arkham Knight which is notoriously unoptimized can run over  fps on my machine.As much as I enjoyed the game play and art style of the game the performance kills it for me.

5692411,0,t1_cx23f7f,Positioned different. Have you tried following the build? Are you saying Im a liar? DHere are all of the things I had trouble with when following the build Jaesung posted I wish we had the appropriate trees   . We do not have the rd column in Flying Slam which knocks enemies into the air without precondition. In NA were fored to settle for Knocks knocked down enemy into the air. In order to get this to work instead of jumping in for an air combo you need to either backstepgtLBMgt to extend the knockdown so you can get back enough to Flying Slam gt Air Combo OR After using a knockup gt Air Combo after your RF using right click during the dazestun backstep as soon as you hit the ground and Flying Slam gt Air Combo.. We dont even have the ability in the Counter tree to spec into immunity against stundaze. The list shows that its available  points in. On ours theres a resist to status effects in the st branch  tier a hongmoon talent which dont have access to or the  second resist in the guide thats found in the th branch th tier another hongmoon talent. NOTE I actually couldnt afford to put any points into counter.. Shin kick requires  points not  in order to trigger the ability to hit with searing palm.. For Comet strike the layout is different on this one. What you want to follow the guide is the nd branch tier . Oh and it costs  points not .. Thank god everything else is the same but I did notice that on searing palm Jae put his searing palm into the left tree instead of the extra daze tree on the right. Im not sure if theres a meaning to this or not.. Watching his KFM combo video Ive watched it a lot xD with more skillpoints he uses the knockup Smite triggered off of F which is in the rd branch nd tier of Smite. With the extra points that we were forced to spend Despite not really having any need for the ones in counter because the good talent isnt available we cant get it without making some other sacrifices like you may be able to drop both a point in shin kick if you only wanted searing blow procs off of resistsleading palm and a point in cyclone kick which might hurt your rf combos efficiency. Just remember Jaesung didnt actually include this skill into the build either so Im sure its fine.And finally what Im working on now is just trying to fit  rfs and a right click knockup within the same  second stundaze. Its super hard! I can get the correct number of rfs off but not within the stun timer. D I feel like its because I waste too much time in the stundaze animation and dont cancel it properly but Im not sure .OH AND NOTE The darker colored pigs just northwest of Pig Ranch are really good to practice on if you use a training weapon of some kind. They are the hidden training dummies!,bladeandsoul,cx2p6bo,1,t5_2skd6

However I like to go into games blind so I didnt watch or read any guides just a few class gameplay videos.  I caved in earlier this year and played the Russian private server a little but only got to level  before telling myself to stop and wait for it to release in NA.

5753300,0,t1_cxa8nlp,I still have the feeling of anticipation in between each closed beta.And for launch well have a  day break of playing the game and by the last closed beta Ill probably have all the classes to  so I will get a break from leveling.Leveling does get a bit boring however but it doesnt take too long so I power through it.I would have to say currently of the  in order. Force Master  This class has a lot of potential to be really good and I like the feel of it while PvPing. It seems to be the second fastest class to level and with the potential it really makes me strive to be better at the class.. Summoner  This is probably the easiest and fastest class to level up but it currently feels super strong and just seemed to be able to face roll a lot of the content.. Blade Dancer  This was the second class I leveled I enjoy it in PvP but it seems like it has a larger margin of error that it is capable  of recovering from. Making it to me too easy of a class. Now I just got done saying Summoner was the easiest but in a sense that its actually fun with how easy it is. If I just want to mess around I can play the summoner and really enjoy it. Probably rd easiest to level.. Destroyer  It plays too slow. Once I get the other  classes to  this will probably be lowest on the list. It feels too bulky there isnt really much variation on what you do. Get them to get their cc breaks on CD and do the same ani canceling. If  you have any more questions let me know. I just learned about the game after Alpha  ended and joined on CBT  but I feel like the method of leveling all the classes is the best way to learn what each does for PvPPvE content.Ill be out for lunch so Ill check once I get home.,bladeandsoul,cxa92su,0,t5_2skd6

At level  and no hongmoon skills you simply do not have the tools needed to effectively fight assassins. The only real advice I can give is to get into the habit of quick turning to face your rear and block. A lot of assassins will use the move to get behind you while in stealth and since BM only block in a  degree range in front of them you have to get good at quick turning. ,bladeandsoul,cxclqkp,1,t5_2skd6

So If you played the earlier BampS  years ago and compare it to the current one. The current one is extremely easy.

It is an Instant cast but my latency made it feel almost exactly like a  second cast making it virtually useless for reactive play i.e. when you most need it. Since from my understanding Warlock burst mobility and other resists are limited this was not a good sign.Finally for some reason I encountered additional gameplay stuttering from skill lag   and  were worst offenders whenever I was on Warlock and only on Warlock.So in my own experience I am only be able to play the least pingdependent classes well i.e. Summoner gt Blade Dancer gt Destroyer.You can just give it a try till  on TW server for free  on the right server and faction red the community is nice!

Spam more BM and the experience should come in. no one is going to be a god right off the bat. Uh I dont know GitGud?

6167544,0,t3_4007wa,looking at the official forums and the dojo and reddit there are not many people active my estimate for those would be kk bought founder packthen if we include all the streamers that streamed blade and soul cbt and brought it to the eyes of new people i would say thats another kk founder packsthen there are probably some communities that dont show themself on the english boards cause they cant speak english so for those i would add around  founders pack maximumso my rough very optimistic estimate would be around kk founders pack have been sold maximum and a more realistic estimate in my opinion would be around kk people bought a founders pack there is really no reason to buy a founders pack cause the game is freeplay and the value of the masters pack is not for the mass cause they dont want to spent  on a game they probably only gonna play a month and even the  pack or whatever it is is too much for a freeplay game and they could buy themself gta or something else insteadso yeah i dont expect more than k sold founder packs,bladeandsoul,cyqop04,1,t5_2skd6

6317263,0,t3_4253fy,Theres a few different ways you can spec into some healing. My best method on never dying is a weapon gem when crit you get hp lifesteal.kinda got lucky finding mine haha Change skill  to the spamable ice shards. Level up your frost stance F crit skill for  dmg you get as hp. And in case level up skill  for healing  of your damage. Essentially. Skill  throws up a single ice shard into the sky when you have a target. You can Spam it  times before the first one lands as each insta cast has less animation delay. Then just spam  and youll surely get a crit before your focus runs out and just spam F in frost stance. So now you have shards falling from the sky and rapid fire healing bolts hitting your enemy. Good sustainable DPS and focus. This may not suite every need for sure. But if you like soloing dungeons and not dying. Give it a shot. Its pretty fun. ,bladeandsoul,cz7pajh,1,t5_2skd6

6347821,0,t1_czb649g,Yeah most definitely. Some weapons you need for breakthrough are only able to be gotten from Dungeons that both drop a random weapon during the run for your entire party to bid on I assume you know how loot in parties work and a chest that you unlock with a key to get a random weapon. So in each run you either have to get lucky and have the dungeon drop your weapon and win the bid or use a key on the chest to get your weapon. Both are RNG so you want a stockpile of keys to keep running it especially if you dont have a lot of money to outbid people.Heres a tip for dungeons though try and make sure you dont have it checked where you can get another of the same class in the same party in crossserver dungeon lobby or only accept people that arent of your class when youre in front of dungeon entrance so youre not heavily competing with other people of the same class if the weapon you need drops since it cant be traded and others wont need it as much.,bladeandsoul,czb6d10,3,t5_2skd6

6350596,0,t1_czbfv0z,gtThe game just released why should it be obvious?lol The game may just released here but its actually  years old...Im tired of people jumping on MMOs and saying they didnt know that the game was like. Its  we have the internet where you can read reviews Reddit where you can read and ask questions watch videos on Youtube and Twitch to watch people play live while you talk to others in their chat. If you buyplay a game these days there is no reason why you shouldnt know whether a game is themepark or sandbox in nature... If people were really interested in the game they would have been reading about it all this time since when they first heard about it.gtGenerally businesses dont want to sacrifice a group of their customers for an arbitrary reason.Correct however if you arent focused in the combat portions of the game then you are not their core audience that they are targeting. Just as I said every game doesnt need to cater to every type of player and trying to do so usually makes something for all players to complain about. If you play this game you should enjoy fighting and anything else in the game is secondary and designed to not be intrusive to getting out in the world and killing something.Especially with the mass of MMOs these days you should cater to the core players as they will be the loyal ones that are more likely to spend money. Typical MMO players now a days are swingers and hop around to the new hype until the new new hype releases.gtThe limit is dumb uve played MMOs for  years never have I cared about a trade skill or the market in them but the cap is dumb lol.If you dont reach the selling cap then how is it dumb? With certain mats being in cash shop a PWer could craft and sell non stop then funnel that money towards upgrades or to their main account Still can be done but its a more time consuming process this way which detracts from the value of actually doing it. It also means there wont be people listing all their items in singulars which in other mmos mean you could own the whole first page. The last point I like that it means less of an oppertunity to stategically inflate or deflate markets based on a single player.I understand you have a different perspective to it but i feel this game has been well managed so far beside bots but they are working on it.,bladeandsoul,czbhqbd,0,t5_2skd6

That said a lot of the HP sets have Crit as the thpiece set bonus. I think I used Scorp for awhile I cant exactly remember but stick with HP and crit for last set bonus.Edit oh and because its so easy to get Fusion powder try Fusing some of your older sets with whatever current set you pick up.

6367688,0,t3_42vdyc,As a Force Master against an Assassin everything and I mean everything is riding over whether or not you have a Frost Orb.Glacial Beam should be your  skill specced  points down the right tree and if it connects youll have a Frost Orb. If you manage to crit with your RB Ice attack you can use your Frost Fury F to gain a Frost Orb though watch out for the Assassins counter.These are your  main ways of getting Frost Orbs. If you have one around you anytime youre hit the enemy will get a chill stack on them. They hit you  times and theyre frozen. This means that just having those Orbs around you will mean that an Assassin simply cannot walk up to you and use his Lightning Crash in stealth and any attempts to combo you will be met with him being frozen in place.Other general tips would be Spam your  while the Assassin is in stealth. You can hit them out of it if you connect. If you havent already spec your SS to be a stun break. As a Force Master you have two stun escapes on a  second cooldown if the Assassin is going to burst you such as after a knockup into web combo you can use them to get away. If theres one thing FM isnt missing its escape tools. Learn to use them wisely. If you spec  points down the right tree for your Divine Veil X you also shut down a lot of the Assassins tools. The dagger they throw in stealth that allows them to daze and teleport behind you? Thats stopped by Divine Veil. Their Turning Leaf attack that has you swap places with them? Thats stopped by Divine Veil. The poison shuriken that they can throw on a resist and then lets them restealth with Tab if theyre close to you? Thats stopped by Divine Veil. Its a very important tool on your matchup. Chill Chill Chill. If the Assassin is Chilled he cant use his charge skills which means he cant restealth by going behind you or stealth after using the position change skill. So long as the Assassin is permanently chilled his stealth is heavily compromised. Not only their stealth from behind is locked but also the restealth skill that stuns you and their Lotus Fury where they charge at you and attack you five times while being invulnerable. Keep Chill on them at all times. If they place a Smoke Screen the thing that stops projectiles you can still hit them with your Ice Coil Ice Z as well as AoEs like your  skill. So if you can get them frozen inside the Smoke Screen you can use your  to push them out of it and get damage. Your Force Choke  can also be used to drag them out of the field. Watch their counter. Do not attack when an Assassin uses their counter. After that though you have  seconds of damage where they cant get stealth from you hitting them this is where spamming RB and F to get Frost Orbs would be a good idea. Keep a mental note of when they used it and count down the seconds until they can use it again that way youll know when to stop attacking and start paying attention. If you feel like you have skill points to spare you can put  points on your Snowball Ice X down the middle line which will allow you to break their defence and instantly freeze them if you succeed.Ultimately itll ride on whether or not you can work around their Decoy counter skill and if you can keep your Frost Orbs up. If you can manage these two things you should be good. Things like Ice Flower Frost Armour and Divine Veil will allow you to stall for important CDs like Glacial Beam and if you play wisely youll do well.,bladeandsoul,czdfprd,1,t5_2skd6

Thanks for the rewards but NC really doesnt need to ask me the same question  times. Just give a person the rewards if theyve already filled it out. Requiring answers on openended responses. Good luck going through the massive amount of responses that are trash and dumb and separating those from the legitimate ones. This is an incredibly poor move and will make analyzing those openends nearly impossible if not amazingly expensive and time consuming. A number of questions have poorly worded options and others have subpar likertscale options.All in all this data they are getting will be sooooooo meh its embarrassing mainly because of point  and .

6449936,0,t3_440pl0,I can live with most of the business decisions NCSoft are making. For example I think its a very strange business strategy to lock costumes per character instead of per account and its a definite reason that I wont be purchasing those  however its their business choice and I assume it makes them money so peace be with it. But the lack of more BASIC account wide stuff  like a shared vault between characters? For materials and items that are tradeable  able to be sent via mail anyway? I just dont get this. Theres rumors that theyll introduce some cash shop item to allow this I guess well see how that works out.My main complaint however as a player who spends  hours in v arena instead of dailiesdungeonsupgrading my gear  I cant forgive how utterly unstable the connection to the servers seems to be. Im not even talking about the EU server outtages here that stuff is unfortunate but it happens I guess. No MMO launch is perfect. But even during normal uptimes Ive begun monitoring my latency Ebon Hall EU ... and its just insane how rapidly it swings. I mean Im spiking from  ping to  ping at random while questing entering and exiting dungeons and its definitely noticeable. Imagine this during Arena fights its impossible to commit combos to muscle memory when the same finger movements and timings leads to entirely different outcomes depending on whether the game thinks I should be at  ping Which is expected as I live about a days drive north of Frankfurt in Denmark or  ping which is just crazy.

Its more that it just feels like a punch in the gut because up until today pretty much everyone assumed that all costumes that would appear in the future would most likely just be a flat amount of NCoin.Now people are just worried that that outfit they looked forward to for ages is going to come along and be unobtainable. Thats all it is really and this feels like an annoying reduction in the customisation options. It doesnt affect the gameplay or the quality of the costumes we have now.It just makes some of us a bit sad that the future of the cash shop costumes isnt as nice as we thought it would be and the hope is that if we raise our voices enough now at the start of this then NCsoft miiight reconsider any major plans to massively roll out constant RNG boxes.

Purple poh set is super easy to get if you just do your dailies and slowly collect them.I did both sets at one point and arena one forces you to camp the npcs for a really long time with minimal fighting and action. Purple poh only requires you to do your  man and  man dailies for a few days which you wouldve done anyway.In that sense fast really comes down to if you want to get a good set RIGHT NOW or you want to wait a week or two to get the optimal set without having to grind for it. In my case I didnt even feel like I invested any time for the purple poh set except unsealing and comparing stats.I also never said that you can get it in half an hour. Read my post again.

6477996,0,t3_44ar6z,From what ive understood from SPvP Diamond BM is that you have to play the ground game to your limits if you wanna be able to compete. This means theres no room for error when fishing for combos. The issue right now is that its extremely hard to do so because it requires perfect timing and cc baits in pretty much every matchup and if that isnt enough you also have to know exactly how much chi you have to squeeze in for DPS without messing up your rotation.I see him do the following against most classes.Vs DestroyerLBM Z    E  A  E as opener  If they tab perfect. If not air combo. Then they either roll back or .Against  you wait it out and follow up with  sec Tab daze and at this point you can C charge if the decide to F roll from the daze take the one that closes distance. Immediatly after you managed to catch them during their F rollback with C use A  RMB  RMB    RMB  E  LMB  LMB  F air combo and then use we cooldowns u have left to chip in more damage with flicker strike stun and  in drawstance.If you do however fail at  of these losing  of your ccs during parry or we reason because your reaction was not good enough youre pretty much done for. thats how hard it is to fully utilize BM atm.Because you pressure so hard people will use their defensives in a very inefficient way and thats where you can make the plays. Dont give them breathing room like i see  of the bms doing. Lead the game. Except vs assassin thats virtually impossible unless you outplay them heavily.Against a summoner that is slighty worse  better then you? Dont bother.

They admitted their mistake of having  login server they announced theyre working on finding a way to split the login servers but its not done yet so they have to do this for now. Every thread is just filled with OH EU TAKES ANOTHER ONE UP THE ASS and its just amazing.I normally play early in the morning more than at night to be honest. The unannounced maintenance was especially annoying for me because I would wake up  hours before normal so I could play a bit only to find I couldnt play at all.But instead of running to the forums to whine about how my day is ruined because I cant play BnS I just decided to play another gamedo house choresmake a nice breakfast for myself since I had so much extra time. At least with the last few theyve announced it so I can plan around the maintenancepatch.Even despite that NA got screwed during prime time on the first weekend the game was released. It sucked yes. I was upset sure. But holy shit Im not so entitled to think that a few hours of the day I cant play means I deserve compensation or that NCSoft is an incompetent lazy bunch of assholes who should all be fired.To be honest Im just happy I can play BnS. Been watching the game from afar for so long that getting to finally play it has been great. I can deal with the issues for a while.Dont get me wrong if NCSoft announces theyll fix these problems and months down the line they still exist Ill lose my faith in them too. But its not even been a month yet and theyve fixed the problems they stated they were working on. Rather than bitching Ill just continue supporting them until they fail to deliver consistently.,bladeandsoul,czv3l7t,3,t5_2skd6

6544337,0,t3_458ezz,I havent renewed my premium and honestly if it wasnt for the glowy shit that premium has when sprinting I wouldnt even have noticed a difference. But Ive just decided to spend my monthly alloted budget on costumes and shit like bag space instead of premium. This looked like it was gonna keep things fresh for me but Ill be goddamned if ncsoft didnt find a way to fuck that up for me by putting the valentine shirt in a retarded bundle... I get that someone at ncsoft is at least trying and it ever so subtly shows. They tried doing a RNG box well damn near the entire player base had a collective hissy fit over that. Which is completely understandable who wants to possibly spend hundreds of dollars trying to get a costume? Not this guy. So they tried to do a bundle instead and managed to shit the bed by throwing in charms xp pots and some roses in an attempt to justify the  price tag. Dont get me wrong Im buying the bundle because I really dig the costume and I genuinely want to support this game. I just would much rather have a morning afterbed head hair style or some sort of adornment to make it feel more like a bundle. Rather than a costume reskinned glasses and some other random stuff that cant be too good or else you get dangerously close to pw. You can notice the devs are listening and trying to find a middle ground with us. It just seems like their hands are tied to a certain extent and the executives are forcing them to try and drain us dry as fast as possible. ,bladeandsoul,czw8ka9,1,t5_2skd6

6546771,1,t1_czwdlxe,And here I thought Guild Wars  you know another game published by NCSoft was still successful getting updated and people were generally happy with how the cash in that game is operated. I guess I was wrong?A lot of X company has a history of Y posts are generally unfounded. If you think NCSoft milks a game as hard as they can and stops caring provide examples. Ultimately a game like Blade and Soul is difficult to rerelease in NAEU if only because they need to figure out a way to make money without fundamentally changing any game systems in a market that is extremely hostile to the point of practical boycotting toward most monetization strategies.I know Ill likely not be agreed with much here because quite a few people seem intent on witchhunting NCSoft instead of providing constructive feedback around the monetization model but Ill go ahead and say what I believeNCSoft did not create a good monetization model. However the game exists to make money. NCSoft knows that making players happy will keep them playing the game and spending money on the game. Because players are unhappy with the current monetization model undoubtedly the monetization designers at NCSoft are attempting to find a way to fix the system. Nobody who is hired in a professional capacity to come up with a way to monetize a game sees something like Blade and Soul and says we should try to make as much money as we can in  months and then turn the servers off! Believe it or not but most of the designers for these systems are better at determining a longterm monetization strategy than the average redditor.That being said its up to you if you dislike the monetization model enough to stop playing the game. Its your prerogative and an easy way to vote with your money. Theres nothing wrong with that. The literal claim that they milk a game as hard as they can then stop caring is the misguided part of your statements.,bladeandsoul,czwhmqb,1,t5_2skd6

Dont forget that Lusung stole Compass from her and made sht behind her back and when she appeared to punish him for being led by mortal greed Yonkai ordered his men to attack her. Thus making obstacles between her and Lusung. I believe they were killed only because they tried to stand in her way while Yehara Soha and Juwol moved aside. Also what grinds my gears is Yunwa Lamangs Syndicate boss is Mushins heir. I realized in that moment that stories from different maps are not connected. Because according to all story we got from first level i had strong belief that Namsayoo was the Mushins heir considering she is Dodkans adopted daughter who found her ages ago and Dodkan tells us during Blackram siege on Bamboo city we have no idea how important she is and we have to save her. About Yunwa except Compass pointing at her we had no other evidence which made story a bit dull. knew that Lusung bastard was going to die he was level .

Any time you exit or enter a shape you get a loadscreen. So when you die in open world even if the respawn in game is only  meter away you are in Death world space you have to reload back into Open World world space.

6594828,0,t1_d01e92s, gtThat post based its entire idea on the fact that piercing did no extra damage vs someone with NO DEFENCE.  Im sorry but THATS GARBAGE.Then wail on an enemy and provide combat log data proving read statistical evidence repeated trials that the piercing behavior works according to your interpretation.   People can argue semantics all day but numbers are a different story.  gt That post says Mobs have  defence. Says WHO? Where is it writen that mobs have only ? Please I must have missed it could you link that please.From the section on defense The defence of the bosses in the big  dungeons in BNS CN are all measured to be .  As for the mobs in the a typical big  dungeon i have measured the defence of the pig spearman and pig gunman to be  just to get  a rough figure on the  def of the target we are hitting. For Sea Serpent Base boss Pohwaran Chef and Fish King has  defence while bartender has  defence see Ref At the bottom of the page are two links to chinese posts with screen captures of the combat logs.  If you want to translate and verify it have fun.gt If you only needed  then you would no longer need any piercing after around .Considering that values of defense vary per mob optimal piercing will vary.  I dont think the other source addressed the issue of mob level vs defense vs piercing as well.  This is all assuming that additional piercing with worth more dps than crit crit power attack power ect.gt ....  Which is LESS then you level  weapon Ring Earing and Necklace give you.Well the hongmoon necklace is the only one of my equipped accessories that even gives piercing and true profane weapon a very common stopping point right now loses the piercing bonus.  Even with the full blackram supply soul shield I only have  piercing.  Most posts advise using mixed soul shield sets so I suspect the majority of players have lt piercing.  For reference gt I guess the game which caps piercing at  gives you way more then that by mistake...... was probably only picked as a soft cap due to the lack of known mobs having more defense.  Even if the big  bosses have  defense nobody will care since theyre kind of a joke.  People will minmax around  man content ie bscbsh.  Assuming bsh bosses have the same defense rating as bsc bosses piercing has no value past  assuming piercing is incapable of generating negative defense values on targets.  If piercing functions as you claim then the cap would be much higher than is possibly attainable with our current gear.gt The game says its works how maths says it should.Again most people are not going to trust that translation and its very easy to argue semantics.  Numbers are better hard evidence.gt The game gives you way more then  just by levelling. There can not therefore be a cap that isnt .Considering defense supposedly functions on an asymptotic curve a very common design for RPG scaling its unlikely piercing would even be able to attain a  defense reduction without being an additive stat.,bladeandsoul,d01gjpa,1,t5_2skd6

The idea of exchange rate is to make it fluctuate on the players so that way even if someone paid for an item with gold in the end a player actually purchased those coins in the end  so that way they always get paid.

6628129,0,t3_46gjtg,Hello Assassin here.What youve described is the two different Assassin playstyles that more or less can make this match up a relatively even one or one skewed towards the Assassin.Theres Assassins who are more aggressive and try to win by killing you. This involves hitting you with their tabswitch which goes through your spin or catching you in a combo in some other way. Animation cancel comboing is more or less the only way a sin can reasonably kill a Destroyer.Against these sins its about not messing up more than twice within your escape cooldowns. If you can just prevent one of the ways they can open on you tabswap shadow slash knockdown or just some random ass stun that you didnt resist with spin then youre relatively safe and want to try to get in your own combo. Sins are squishy so if you catch them without their escape in a full combo you more or less won the round.The other playstyle thats much stronger vs Destroyers is to play for time. This sin specs into skills like Poison Mine Stealth Bomb etc and just chips away at your HP while maintaining stealth for as long as possible. Theyre not trying to kill you they just want to get enough damage off to win by score which they WILL in almost all cases if you let time run out since you naturally have more health than sins and score is based on damage dealt AND you have much more sustain than them.Against these sins youll have to be aggressive. The worst thing you can do is think the time they spend on the other side of the arena is a good time to use your shield to heal up. Doing so is  in favor of the sin as youre just letting him get up more cooldowns to stall more AND if they get out of combat they can get another s of free stealth. For this kind of sin I highly suggest specing into your vaccum skills I know your Jump can be techd for a m pull and your kick I think its Z? can also be specd into an AoE m pull. These skills will rip sins right out of stealth which can really mess up these sins flow. ,bladeandsoul,d04wm1h,3,t5_2skd6

6629316,0,t3_46gyq6,Thanks that youre taking the time to give us this AMA.My Question isWhat are your plans for EndgameContent regarding OpenWorld PVP and Reward Systems?While the leveling phase of the game felt exciting and the game overall offers a great Look amp Feel it lacks in my opinion endgamefeatures that feel exciting and worth doing.To give you a little bit more insight my current BnS day is nothing but grinding for nothing and it feels boring.Ive finished the new mushin tower in minutes with only  wipes.Open World PVP is pointless because it offers  rewards. Players therefore only split into channels and join their factiongroups to farm eachothers camps.It is completely pointless to level up your equipment right now because there is  No Open PVP at all see above. You can do any dungeon with Infernal Equipment Dungeons offer nothing but new soul shields and ofc costume grindsHope you can give us a little bit more insight because i doubt that me and my friends can stick to the game much longer if theres no change coming. We keep doing dailys and grind Arena  but at the moment we feel like theres no point in grinding anything at all.We have high expectations in this game because the CombatSystem is really exciting and unique so please give us something to do that is worth doing.Best RegardsYuuffy,bladeandsoul,d05113j,8,t5_2skd6

Nice work and thanks for the ideas given me some thought against FM and Summoner which are the two matchups I have the most trouble with by far.I was plat last season and nearly plat this season mostly thanks to you teldoo and supa hot vile.What are your thoughts on ice mine against summoner? Ive been experimenting with it and found it works as a nice oh shit button if you dash at the summoner and plop down the mine and detonate right as the cat is dashing at you. Its a very useful delay since you can string it in to wait out your tab lotus fury and shuriken cloud cooldown. It allows you to survive one of those annoying flowers on your face and it also guarantees you a free invis afterwards against one of the matchups thats hardest to stay in permainvis against.But you lose a lot of the pressure that poison mine gives you and its harder to spam shadow drain without a second source of poison you can apply while invis. I feel its a much more defensive option and makes it harder to outpoint the summoner by the end of the match though surviving becomes easier since you have another source of breathing room.,bladeandsoul,d081vq4,9,t5_2skd6

6674451,0,t3_472flo,There is a lot to learn about this boss but compared to a lot of classes this fight is hard for BM. Once you learn the pattern it will help you deal more damage when you can and how to avoid damage when you cant. People saying this is easy for BM most likely have done this fight many times before and already know the boss mechanics. After understanding the most dangerous combos i have been able to beat him but just barely passed  days i was at  secs left. If you CC him with  sec left and maintain that CC he will stay CCed for the final bit of damage. My problem is i dont know the minor combos that allow me to still dps and so i lose time there. This fight is all about burst windows and it takes practice but its by no means easy for BM.,bladeandsoul,d09p2h9,1,t5_2skd6

Do you realize that there are some websites that are so busy that they dont even log http requests? You are a phony.What is arena? I timed it and you average about  soulstones per hour which comes out to a measily .gph and thats not even including the fact that I didnt account for the time needed to farm certificates and I won all my games because my rating wasnt stabilized yet.,bladeandsoul,d0gslw3,1,t5_2skd6
6743742,0,t1_d0gpptx,Well sure but Im not the one complaining. I merely gave them examples of what it took to change the mind of certain companies even if reluctant at first.Im not inferring that NCWest has to listen to us but if you gather enough people then in one their meetings they will have to discuss what to do to handle the issue. Otherwise the old dangling carrottreat in front of the customer isnt going to keep them going and consequently not spend money on the game. Obviously not everyone would leave due to the issues that many are upset about but its usually much harder to gain a customer than to keep one after a certain point.FWIW I dont have bots on my server probably cause it isnt one of the highly populated servers. However you get  players or sometimes  that want to mine a node and have waited considerably to reap the rewards however only  does. If they were looking for rewarding the player fairly then this is not the way to do so. If instead they want the most cutthroat reward system possibly which makes the various game design decisions seem somewhat logical. However there are other areas of the game where the design decisions seem to conflict with that principle.,bladeandsoul,d0guz12,1,t5_2skd6

Check for Cinderlands ones too trade any you find in at the Hogshead exchange wheel. PVP dailies will give you  stones and a fair amount of beans for just a few minutes of work. Field boss dailies barely require effort because other people will do most of the work for you Huren Safiji Huljikar Lycan whatever the bears name is hungry ghost profane jiangshi king kaari Green dungeon dailies skip Croak King because you cant cross server or windstride directly to it.  When I cross server these usually the party is like halfway done before my loading screen even finishes.If thats not enough youll probably have to run around doing mob dailies.  And if THATS not enough you might have to farm cinderlands stones to trade in.,bladeandsoul,d0lzmpu,2,t5_2skd6

Dont stay too far or else he does his annoying charge. If he says React it means hell SS back and do a  hit combo which means CC him.  I just Phantom Grip gt Drain to stop it. Spec was basically full burn spec except chill on RMB.  Keep burn up to keep damage up. The Red AoE buff is very important.  For FMs you get  AP per stack but take  damage per second.  I decided to go for  stacks. If you dps fast enough you can skip the ice circles but if not use Divine Veil for  hits and QE knockdown. For the Fire AoEs at  stand m away and QE the last AoE to keep up dps time. Divine Veil Frost Fury and pots for healing.,bladeandsoul,d0nenzf,3,t5_2skd6

6806158,0,t3_48wjqw,I just got lvl  and am in the Misty Woods area.What does it mean when people are saying things like looking for red ? Im guessing its something about kill trading for the faction dailies? How does this work exactly? Do the opposite fraction people invite you to a party or something?What does it mean when people are asking for the channel for insignia farm? What is insignia farm what is it for and where do you do it?I see people wanting to sell or trade things in the chat. How does trading work exactly? Is it even possible to trade outside of mailing and the marketplace? Do two people have to be on the same server to trade? The same area?I read this guide that says one should do the world raids E.Fleet Supply and Nightshade Harbor daily to earn gold. Can I do these as a fresh lvl  with bad gear? I only have k hp.Even though Im lvl  I havent explored all parts of every map yet in Moonwater Plains. Should I go to the remaining areas or can I skip them?It seems that exp earned after lvl  goes to the HM levels. What do I get when I level up? Is it important to level up fast to play end game things like raids dungeons and world PvP?What is the most profitable way to spend ViridianCinderlandsMoonwater Valor Stones? I have no idea what these things are for.Is it worth it to keep doing craftinggathering? Im lvl  in all my  guilds and barely get any profit yet. My guilds are Green Thumbs Tree Fellers Soul Wardens Merry Potters which I read somewhere are the best ones  or is there a better combo? When I create alts should I choose the same guilds as above or another combo for most profit I have not unlocked mailing?Anything else important I need to know or do as a lvl ?Sorry if too many questions.,bladeandsoul,d0nru96,1,t5_2skd6

After he teleports get ready for one of the  special moves he says nothing gt he either counters or he does Dragon char.  If you get countered hell use a followup while you are stunned so use Tab or SS if specd. he says Resist gt he does the halfcircle AoE that stuns and you can out range him if hes casting or iframe if youre too close.  If you get hit hell do a nasty followup. he says React gt he SSs and then charges you and does a big  hit combo.  You need to CC him I use Phantom Grip.If hes too far away he may do a big combo.If youre slow he does the Red Circle AoE around him and you can take the buff if you want but its a DoT on you.  If you see bluewhite swirls around him just SS back and hell go up into the air for  projectile shots Divine Veil it and then QE the following landing hit.Thats pretty much all his moves.,bladeandsoul,d0o896y,6,t5_2skd6

We can kill fujinampraijin with over . minutes left on enrage. Why would I ever pug with complete randoms without putting a gear req. It takes  shit profane characters to get the dps of  pirate characters. And thats ignoring the skill differential implications of not investing in your character. True profane level is easy and the people at this level rarely have the other stats up to par nor the experience.  If you cant gear yourself better than my alt that has always just done faction dailies and pvp you dont deserve to run naryu with much better geared players.

Generally ranged is of course safer because they have to dodge a lot less and in most mmos that also translates into higher uptime because meeles have to run away to dodge  dps while ranges can always attack. In bamps however you can dodge without running away with iframes. Of course with that said you still carry a higher risk with meeles so with the mentality of safer is better you will of course prefer a ranged over a meele dps in pugs because with ranged you dont have to pray that he can find his dodge button.Regarding wow  if i remembver right they increased meele dps to account for the lower uptime made meele top charts on static fights while still being mediocre on dynamic ones. ,bladeandsoul,d0tjkvz,1,t5_2skd6

Glad to be proven right that they are treating this game as nothing more than a short term cash grab that has no future. Actually Im not glad. I hate it. But hopefully more and more players will see the truth of the matter and voice their concerns both vocally and by not spending money and supporting this scummy fp model. Properly incentivize Premium. Dont paywall key features to force purchases because youre too lazy to come up with something good which is brain dead easy.  The NAEU versions of this half decade year old game are by far the worst. Maybe thats their reason... the game is old so who cares no one will want to play it. Whatever they think about this game they need to change it and fast. Mushin and Arena still ms for a month and a half. No comment. No update. No resolution. No fix. This is just one example of the game limping into an early grave. Lot of people bailing and going to BDO. Starting to think these are the smart ones. ,bladeandsoul,d0u069k,1,t5_2skd6

6867288,0,t1_d0uo414,Id say this one will have  years at least to it just like every other MMO out there.  Whether or not those will be average or great years is a whole other story.So far its just as you said the team just seems to be concerned with making money.  Fortunately for us its a free to play game so players will keep playing as long as they dont get bored.  The pace of new content is nice and well probably stick with it for a year or so before it slows down since by then I think were supposed to catch up to the other regions.  And as long as new things exist to spend money on which weve established theyre so good at releasing I cant wait to see what they charge for wings if we ever get those people will keep buying stuff regardless of the number complaining or boycotting.The good news is that they do seem to make progress bit by bit.  Login queues and servers being full will plague pretty much every game launch and those are gone already.  The gold spam in chat has decreased significantly plus they added the separate block list for spammers.  Being a Korean game Im not really sure how much NA can change or do on their own as well as how big their team is to work on things.Nothing at the moment is truly gamebreaking so I expect the community to thrive for at least a full year.  Were still only two months into this so people currently feel invested and obligated to stay to get their moneys worth.  If the devs dont start to show an interest in us besides a cash grab by then people will continue to play since its free and the game will keep going for sure but a lot of people will give up decide their time and money are better spent elsewhere.,bladeandsoul,d0upujc,1,t5_2skd6

6948058,0,t1_d13eiht,Basically a party usually consist of  tank   DPS. The  DPSs each bring their own utilities.KFM is both Tank  Utility. Sins only utility unfortunately overlap with that of KFM namely the buff. So when it come to picking between the  KFM is picked over Sin. Because KFM fill  roles while Sin fill only .Now theres that argument of stacking the buffs since the CD is .m while the buff resist is only m allowing for more up time.The thing is in  cap most fight dont allow you to stand and fight for very long so having more buff actually dont bring that much most of the time. And you want the KFM buff to overlap with the WL buff anyway for that extra uhm when it come to down time think Minotaurs debuff staged when he hit wall for example many bosses in  have similar mechanic where you want all your buffs to stack for a specific short duration so having an extra buff can actually bring more harm than good since it mess up that overlap duration m every overlap instead of .mSin are usually used when a BM is main tank. But since KFM is the vogue tank slot Sin are usually left out in high tier  man statics.KFM  WL buffers  Des  SMN grabs is considered the most perfect comp.TBH though just play what you like then find group that suit you.

6999636,0,t3_4bihvy,I cannot fathom why people are complaining that NCSoft is rushing to get North America up to date with Korea. One of the things that I love about what Square Enix does with its MMOs is that all regions are always in sync.Who cares what the motives are? Do you really want content to lag for years behind Korea? Do you really want it to be rubbed in your face all the time that Korea comes first and us dirty westerners can have our sloppy seconds and we can like it? Surely if NCSoft thought this game was dying in North America it wouldnt be putting any manpower into getting new content to North America. Sure maybe its a little irritating to all the people pushing progression right now but if we get to patch parity with Korea things will even out. And if we get patch parity then we can push progression on the actual current content instead of stuff people in Korea have had on farm since last year.

7005071,0,t1_d1acsav,They are pretty fucking bad. Anyone that can tech chase will win the match up every time. Both their  escape and f are practically the same animations and will get blown up by tech chases. At least other classes when they escape they get a second chance. Against a good destroyer LBM BM or KFM you lose the instant you get knocked down. The only one that can match your down time is an LBM so thats the closest of the bunch you have of winning the match up. FM vs WL is actually a  match up that is impossible to win if your opponent is even half competent. Im not even overstating or exaggerating that. Its literally almost impossible to beat a FM with WL assuming the FM isnt retarded. The only class match ups that are alright are against summoners and sins. The only class that even matches close to your description is Summoner. I dont think any class is even close to op insta win class by even a tiny margin. You can ask any good PvP player and Im sure theyll tell you something similar. Warlock was worse than BM on the last patch by a good margin. ,bladeandsoul,d1adazb,0,t5_2skd6

7011063,0,t3_4boofr,Here my comment on another post.True Profane to Oathbreaker is cheaper than True Profane to Siren but every breakthroughevolve past that costs more on the Oathbreaker path. You save maybe gold of matsgold on Oathbreaker but then you end up paying g of feemats every evolvebreakthrough if not more due to some of them requiring Silverfrost mats.Awaken siren also gives Skill boost which you only get on Awakened Oathbreaker I believe. Also the oathbreaker series seems to give the  crit buff. And overall it has like  more attack power per upgrade. But its still not worth the extra gold you end up spending on them... There was some chart based on TW matsfees where you can calculate with markets cost. And by putting a very generous Silverfrost mats price on the spreadsheet Like very very cheap prices for all silverfrost Profane to True Breeze through Oathbreaker path was about g more than Profane to True Breeze through the Sirenpirate path.,bladeandsoul,d1b1u4k,1,t5_2skd6

They give you a HUGE boost in stat compared to other accessories past lvl  that only give like  atk power  crit and whatnot for x the cost..

The mechanics there is the most straight forward of the . No auto attack just hugely obvious AoE that can be iframe. I play FM and as I usually get aggro  of the time Yeti has been the most relaxing to play for me. The other bosses keep rushing me and auto attack me like a bitch. But thats just me and FM i guess.

7028754,0,t1_d1cwbkl,Its not about being in max gear  near max gears. Everyone can do that if they play long enough. The point is that people are too used to using gear to push content right now. So when harder contents come around even those that have the highest grade of gears wont be able to clear it simply because they werent prepared for it. Add to that the buffed HP and damage and that mean  of the people will struggle.Also with the rate of release that were getting if youre required max gears to clear new contents most people wont be able to do so. Youll end up having a majority of people being behind by several tiers of progressions.Ive never said that i want the game to be face rolling in my post. In fact I made a point that the game right now is too easy so the buff is warranted. But I do think that making it too hard artificially is not a permanent solution much longer in the future consider the power creep of the contents that were getting especially for the demographic of players of the West players who buy too easily into public consensuses. What do you think will happen when we hit a plateau where a majority of the population cant clear? Theyre gonna cry the game being too hard and push for NC to nerf. And they might overdo it like they do right now nerf contents to oblivion. I dont want that to happen.Also your point of Why would a nonmax or near max geared player be doing the hardest end game contents without dedicated clans backing them up? is only true to a certain extend. Ive watched ton of streams of KR where random pug with suboptimal gears  or  tiers behind were put together on spot and just casually clear the latest dungeons. They are able to do that because a majority of the players there know what to do in those dungeons.But we dont have that here in the West. People cant even be asked to read the patch notes let alone researching their contents. People with True Pirate were failing Yeti all fucking day. Now imagine those  mil bosses come our way with a buffed  mil boss. A single player will no longer be able to carry a party like we do right now. So the entire population will be stuck for a long fucking time.Im not asking for easier contents Im just looking for a confirmation that NCWest have some sort of vision of what theyre dealing with and that theyre in some way actively looking for a happy medium for what to come. Because if they keep going with the formula that theyre using I can only imagine the cry on reddit when that happen.,bladeandsoul,d1d29q2,1,t5_2skd6

Also if a sizeable amount of the players online or in a given area report one person for spam say  of the faction in BnS for instance they should be automuted across all chat types including and especially whispertell for a certain amount of time say one minute and each time it happens again to the same name the penalty time increases by .

So doing men dungeons crossserver would just result in you getting kicked when trying to join a party up to a point where most people would require you to have lets say AP no sins.But I am in a position where I am in a static group and we do dungeons every day so I cant really tell a lot from experience how cross server is for nonFMs or nonsummoners.But I wouldnt go as far as saying the game is so unbalanced I need to retire my character to reroll on a FM or something which quite a few sins I knew actually did.Also it isnt about trust it is just that when you get FMs you dont need to do or know anything in the dungeons in fact no one needs to know anything about it the FM just stand somewhere and melts the bosses hence most of the FMs I meet cant even play the game properly.,bladeandsoul,d1go4f7,1,t5_2skd6

7072937,0,t1_d1i2e54,Yeah so I just watched some of the video you linked. You seem to have no fucking clue how anticheat in games works or the most efficient way to get rid of bots.No its not a good idea to hire GMs specifically to go around banning obvious bots. You want to know why? Oh hey out of all the bots I just banned I seem to have banned  legitimate players as well. Oopsies! Now you have to invest more into support teams to actually get those players unbanned! So now you have  people on board thanks to human error. Double the salaries.Oh theyll just ban the obvious bots! Alright so there wont be anymore obvious bots. Then what? People arent just gonna quit botting because of that. Theyre making a fuck ton of money from it. Theyll just get a new script. Ban the guys with the name zzzasdk Okay so the next batch will have the names. Erania or Komozaro Those seem legitimate no?The only reason the bots are a problem at all is due to the fact that theyre literally not invested into an anticheat at all. Theyre using fucking game guard. A completely dog shit anticheat. Literally completely useless. They should not be investing into GMs specifically to go around and ban bots. Thats inefficient as fuck. What they should be investing into is a small anticheat team. One that works on creating an anticheat to automatically detect botters. So again just gonna go over what I said in case I missed anything.The reason you dont want to hire people to go around the game banning bots is that due to human error they WILL ban real players. This solution only works for the first ban wave. After that they are a completely useless hire.

I dont believe theres any animation cancellingMostly keyboard presses LB and RB are used pretty sparingly but itll mostly be RB but even thats just between attacks or during cooldownsDPS probably wont be as high until you get HM skill but if youre in a party all you really need to do is be level  and soulburn here and there at good times and everyones happyHelix build isnt too bad either its mostly pressing  and RB but the pacing is faster. Id probably go with something slower first to let your wrist get some rest. Your health takes priority. Either way your main damage is pretty much keyboard buttons while holding RB for subsidiary damage. LB is for focus recoverychip damageYou dont even touch Q or E since its only used for when your thrall is outOverall its a pretty stationary class that relies more on planned attack usage vs spam so Id highly recommend it.Summoner might be okay but your DPS is a moderately paced LB  RB alternation if you go sunflower route,bladeandsoul,d1jdimv,1,t5_2skd6

7094046,0,t1_d1keo63,Watch videos and practice a shit ton. If you dont enjoy bm pvp or pvp in general I dont think its worth trying to do for gold. If you arent plat I dont think the time you invest is worth the money you get out especially if you arent actually enjoying it.That being said if you want I can try to teach you a few things sometime or at least enough to beat the destroyer bots. I got diamond for the first time the other day but dropped back to like  so Im not the best but I think I can at least teach a few things. Pve wise though your problem is actually a pretty common one. The real ways of making money in this game are often gated by well having money. Just try to do your dailies and stick to the  man versions of the new purple dungeons.  Do misty woods  faction dailes every day with soulstones prices thats a solid g I do it on  characters a day. New faction dailies give  soulstones a day but I doubt you can get credit there with your current gear. Other than that I think the best advice is to find a guild or people that are willing to help you and maybe run things with you even if youre a bit under geared. In my guild on poh I try to invite some of the lower geared people for our dungeons give them the drops like poh perfume. If you learn the dungeon people should have no problem running with you even if youre a bit undergeared excluding again the new purple  mans. Id imagine the ap requirements are really frustrating but if you wanna catch up youre gonna have to work hard as youre pretty far behind already.To give you an idea though new purples give about .g total just for their dailies. Mushin tower is another g if you can clear up to . misty woods faction is g more if you level  Alts then you can do silver frost  mans another g or do random silver frost dailies i usually do the ones in the mountains theres like  dailies that give s and a shit ton of exp each. Then you can do poh  bsh  and lab  which is another g even if you get no drops So assuming you do these all of them youre entirely capable of doing except maybe mushin past junghado youre looking at almost  gold a day.,bladeandsoul,d1kh9qe,2,t5_2skd6

He might or might not have official info that clued him into it. ...This explanaition is invalid and you choose to ignore it.Now your best analysis is that Ncsoft is inflating the HP on the money machine that is Jhungado and the otherwise perfect bot farm that is mushin tower is a good way for Ncsoft to attack  Money Sellers while also make some mad money by selling gold in game at that awesome exchange rate they have going in the currency trade at the expense of us the poor players that will take all this abuse because as part of the good mmo community we are known to never abandon a game no matter how difficult it is...Besides that you are completele right. It is really unfair to ask people to waste time doing repetitive stuff in a MMO just so their characters achieve arbitrary inflated numbers! No one wants those numbers and wouldnt do that unless they are forced! After all this is a genre where skill should trumph all and no one should be prevented to challenge AND WIN any form of content if they know to dodge the red stuff and to press their keybinds really really fast...

I have a work laptop that is essentially my own PC while I have the job I take it home I choose what is installed on it and I use it to develop software. When I want to use it to play games after work I reboot the laptop as a quick way to make sure any work processes are gone.Blade and Soul works after I reboot. I get this error if I try to start BnS during my lunch break I dont reboot during lunch since it would be a waste of time. Im running a bunch of things right now ranging from Virtual Machines to Outlook to various CC development tools and IDEs VPNs proxies. Its a clusterfuck of a PC that youd only see for someone developing the kind of telecoms stuff Im working on and sometimes video games when Im working on my indie game. I honestly think that GameGuard is upset by something Im running given the nature of the work.

But I know now that youre supposed to get a frost orbit so whenever the cat attacks you the summoner gets frozen in place.Okay so thats all very fine and well but how does that work? Why doesnt the cat get frozen too? Or maybe it does and I just havent noticed it. So how do you combat that? Do you just recall the cat use petal storm and wait until the FMs frost orbits expire?

7166644,0,t3_4dnq2f,A couple corrections and additions.a. Hongmoon F inferno is better than F inferno if you can afford the . second cast time because a both hits do a lot more damage b both hits do not increase your threat c each hit gives you  fire orbits for dual dragonsdragonblaze and d the second cast does not put all your other skills on the global cooldown.b. TF of LMB is better than the non hongmoon F and arguably better than the hongmoon F because it creates fire orbits on crit so you dont have to use fire fury to get orbs for dragonblazedual dragons making your rotation easier in my opinion and fire fury is a dps down from other abilities. It also is significantly better during Soulburn since you can spam awakened dual dragons without having to to use fire fury to build orbs.c F of impact is better than F because you cant animation cancel F so using it causes a dps loss.D Short fuse recovers  chi per second for  seconds on use very useful for if youre running low. F RMB increases your attack speed making you do more damage in PVE. The chill isnt very useful in PVE so you should always be using F in PVE. when youre in TF of divine veil any resist including melee attacks into frost sheath heals you for . if youre getting attack by a bunch of mobs veil into frost sheath will heal you up to full Glacial beam is an instant cast stun that also snares bosses for  seconds. take it and use it. Meteor does negligible damage without burn but a LOT of damage with burn. If you use meteor make sure burn is up. Burning Soul increases your LMB damage and causes dragonblaze to increase your damage from fire abilities by  for  seconds. Extremely useful and make sure to take it. Windstorm has a shorter global cooldown between uses than your other abilities. If you spec it into tF its your best damage potential IF the target is grappled outside of soulburn just hold F. Put  extra point if youre worried about taking aggro. Heatwave Fire Tab f or f is a short  second cooldown AOE  second CC for mobs and bosses very good for bosses like Yeti and Blood Mane where you need to CC them to save your team.

7175654,0,t1_d1thi8x,I was with your idea until gt  In addition to it they could increase CD of stealth mechanics or put a debuff not allowing restealthing for a short duration upon leaving stealth.Thats too much of a nerf for a class that isnt at the top anyway. Unless the short duration is maybe .s or something. Dont need longer cooldowns though theyre already super long..mins for flower stealth and s for smoke stealth. Decoy is literally our only defensive skill that isnt a timed iframe so making that CD longer would just gut the class. Thats why no one uses the dazeblind one unless theyre trolling because they know theyre far above in skill. That extra s CD is enough to ruin it.I think a good change would be to make the s invuln just a base thing like it is with summoner and remove the evasion after those  seconds so if we get hit were knocked out of stealth.Also these same changes should apply to summoner stealth. They also should lose the evasion after s invuln.,bladeandsoul,d1tt0m0,0,t5_2skd6

Unless youre very lucky or you spend money on cash shop for keys expect many days even weeks to get to True Pirate.The new path is more expensive about g more. But all the breakthrough fodders are given to you via story quests.So it come down to your choice of how you want to play. If you dont mind buying gold then Oathbreaker is a much better option just for the fact that you get it up right away day  if you want to. But if youre playing regularly without wanting to spend any money then youre gonna have to go the Pirate way simply because of the cost but this would take you many days of continuously grinding old contents that most people no longer do regularly.

7199933,0,t1_d1whq7t,SSPlains is more about how messy it can get Ive yet to experience it properly so I cant really comment.Frost Basin is a huge step down in design compared to E.Supply and NSH. Of the only three quests available one is a generic grind instead of a set of specific grinds which meant that the field would spread evenly one is a boss list which is fine although the spawn mechanic for Barakan was obviously left unfinished and just tied to raw naga kills and the third one is a collection. The problem with the third one is that it has two areas where it can be completed but the right side sacrifices and vases is so obviously better than the left side that everyone flocks there.Then theres the lack of a proper final boss with a specific spawn mechanic having to kill  bosses to spawn PohMM meant that the entire channel had to work together. Balroks instead just spawn over time well technically the guys circling their spawn point do. Dark Balroks then are just a predictable extra spawn with nothing interesting except a slightly spicier box and double the HP.Finally the biggest problem of all the level design. The two pirate harbours are intricate developing over different layers with obstacles. Getting there the first time was a wonder of where do I go. Frostscale Basin is literally a flat round valley. Take any two points in it you can travel from one to the other in a straight line. Its completely uninspired.,bladeandsoul,d1wkowz,6,t5_2skd6

Why play a Massively Multiplayer Online game if youre just going to solo thats just asking to quit. Sure theres a lot you can solo and going through the storyline is basically a solo experience but when you get endgame its almost necessary to group up or youre going to have a hard time.That being said this games leveling was pretty enjoyable to me since it has a very linear gear progression system and was very easy to level with our absolutely OP gear.

Judging from your responses in this thread it sounds like you shouldnt play arena if youre interested in winning pvp by only knowing your own class and not your opponents.   The only really one sided matchup here is sin. Here are some basic tips for the other two matchups from my experienceFM  Triple kick i leave targeted instead of aoe since FMs are so slippery   pts middle tree in avenging fist is a necessity it lets you close on them and break freeze   points in ice guard lets you break freeze and escape from large burst  only need  point in your tab since nothing else really helps  run elbow smash instead of counter its weird to adjust but it is super spammable and reflects damage to them even at range  using middle tree in flurry can be good. no daze but it is an i frame instead so itll put you on them with your triple kick rdy to go  Summoner   pts right side of triple kick so you can stun both pet and player  amp instead of ice guard helps burst through their healing so you can guarantee the   at least  point in left tree of TAB is necessary so you can break out of cat grapple always save your tab for this  again run elbow smash but even more so here since it doesnt count as a block so summoners cant use some of their skills on you  run pve tree of searing palm for max burst  Sin  if you get a sin more than once... take a break and queue back up in  Anyone feel free to add in but I think those simple build changes will make a huge difference.,bladeandsoul,d27bivl,1,t5_2skd6

But this was kind of thrown at us after a few weeks of silverfrost a lot of already farmed tons of pages for the  page HM skill. We should have been able to buy the pages for beans especially because PvE and PvP are intertwined whether we like it or not. ,bladeandsoul,d2b7sgv,13,t5_2skd6

I farm up half the mats myself but still spend around G for the remaining soulstones moonstones and quartz.

Youll also need the sirenpirate bangles for evolution and breakthrough so I think the total amount youll need after you can skip these dungeons is  belt   pirate weap   other pirate weap   pirate emblems from NSHBSH  bracelet   belt   siren wep   other siren weap   siren emblems. You also get perfumes machismos and other goodies from these dungeons all needed for upgrades. They go for s. Also BSHNSH purple soulshields are the base stepping point from every begginer character. Also its been a long time since I did these dungeons so I mightve forgotten that you can buy some of these accessories on the market I think it was the siren bracelet. F gt siren bracelet you can check it yourself. Hongmoon gear is forever but if you dont have the resources needed to upgrade your equipment you can temporarily replace it with the superior bracelets you get from drops and quests depending on what you like doing in pve. There are bracelets which increase threat crit etc while belts offer more defensive stats. Think for yourself but also make some research on whats best for you.Also later you can get a soul from the naryu dungeon which is upgradeable as well although very costly.. No you dont get to choose anything its a linear storyline. I dont want to spoil anything but its all part of the plot. SPOILER  you want revenge join the dark side but then learn that it was a mistake become good beat the bad guys gg.THE ONLY choice of goodbad you can choose is when upgrading your legendary weapon. You can choose the good side for increased defense healing triggering defensive skills or the evil side basically increasing your attack skills power etc. Your weapon design will evolve accordingly whitepearl for good darkred for evil but this in no way declares your character personality or interacts with the storyline.,bladeandsoul,d2pilqp,2,t5_2skd6

In most cases this is a better option than the  second dazestun resist of the left tree.As soon as you get Hongmoon Counter though the final tier of teh left tree also gives you this iframe so the th tree is basically worthless for pvp the difference between st and th with hongmoon is  seconds of bonus threat vs  seconds of stundaze immunity as both have the iframe now.Note that once you have hongmoon block youll generally use  points in the Left tree but against some matchups youll want to swap to Elbow Smash nd column. Assassins Forcemasters and Warlocks are generally the ones you want to use this for as it gives faster spamming of higher damage reflects and you can use it when debuffed with no defensive skills like sins wasps as Elbow Smash counts as offensivedefensive.,bladeandsoul,d2xahjc,1,t5_2skd6

This was a on going trend for months but recently Ive decided it was too much and Im burning out. So I have been cutting back to just doing the Daily purple  Dailly chellenge on my summonermy PvE main. After that Its arena sorta... lately I have burnt out from arena. It seems like the population of Arena players have greatly dwindled. It becomes hard to find any game over k rating. Honestly this point im not sure what I am doing. I dont want to fall behind in PvE content so I do my Dailies or the ones that are most profitable and If I got time I would do a few matches of Arena do daily.,bladeandsoul,d307y4n,0,t5_2skd6
7549076,0,t3_4iqo3j,I think youll like this game. massive time sink for fp with the option to buy your way through all the grind pprogress or pw not gonna debate it here. It is what it is Repeatable content. Most content is instance based with a supporting lobby for easy access. Very easy to jump into a lobby from anywhere. Themepark style. Even travelling the open world is replaced by teleporting shrines. PvP is geared balanced but not level balanced nor skill balance. I have a feeling NCsoft will address this issue in a few months due to one of the biggest pvp community disband until further support from NCsoft for various issues. PvP is still playable but i wouldnt recommend playing this game sole for the pvp content sadly this game was marketed as a great pvp game the irony.... Pve is typical for most MMOs. The combat is one of the better ones out there. Pve is fun for me but to get most out of your experience you would need a good group of friends or clan to play with. You can have OP gear or should I say gear that is over the required recommended level for current content. The wall for this gear is really high with current content i have a feeling  of all top geared people spent some money to obtain their legendary weapon. OP gear is used in both openworld pvp v and pve content. Is it getting support? Well... its getting fast content release. I dont follow the community managementPR guy or contacted their support team yet. Seems like the kinda listen to our complaints? Not sure how much they are willing to cater to the community so far its been very underwhelming for support.If you need support for technical issues i hear its a lost cause.If you need support for payment issues i hear you have to jump through hoops and waiting time.If you need support for lost items from hacks or accidents i hear its good!If you need support for getting hacked i hear it makes the issue worst! side note NCsoft may have had a security breech but i think its more likely that people who got hack used the same email and password on other less secured sites. If you want my personal experience I was never hacked on any game except for vindictus which I quit long time ago but when I logged in to check my stuff it was all gone lol.EDIT I may add one thing. You should play this game with atleast  friend. Soloing content early level is difficult because of the sparse population. Everyone is now clustered at the end game content with little people joining from the bottom. You may remedy this problem by looking for the most populated server maybe they have more people in the early stages of the game the early stages isnt that long though you can get through it with  hours of game time if your semiefficient,bladeandsoul,d30aky8,5,t5_2skd6

7669610,0,t3_4kcwsd,While damage is a long topic of debate Dark pulls ahead because its far more versatile since theyre actively using Decoy Stances tools which protect the party and inflicts poison stacks and have more reliable double CCs. Lightning also carries a significant amount of weaknesses Lightning is incredibly overreliant on Stealth Stance which is very difficult to maintain due to enter stealth conditions and true sight or area of effect mobs constantly hitting you out of it. Lightning Decoy Stance damage is utterly crap while Dark Stealth Stance is still quite strong. Decoy Stealth Protection Poison Breath Venom Slash and so forth are all only available in Decoy Stance. Again your DPS drops the moment you exit Stealth Stance as Lightning. Lightning is less capable of inflicting  stack poison since Venom Slash and Pierce need Decoy Stance and Decoy Venom Pierce ruins Stealth Protection and Acrid Star needs a resist. Lightning only has double CC stun without sacrificing essential tools in their kit. Dark has both double CC stun and knockdowndaze and Hongmoon Heart Stab can effectively cover Shadow Drain.Darks weaknesses are not major as Lightnings. Their overreliance on poison though Lightning is affected by this too and hongmoon skills can be easily alleviated and not staying long in stealth to receive its benefits of higher evasion and increased movement speed isnt too relevant in most cases.That said Lightning still shines in situations where we can solo areas to avoid dying Frozen Lairs miniboss pair Awakened Necropoliss Pyre Lord Avalanche Dens Yeti Chief Hunter Soguns Laments GoldSilverkins etc. but otherwise,bladeandsoul,d3dzo78,4,t5_2skd6

7788487,0,t3_4m035b,I dont think you should choose to play this class considering wether its   hard to learn or if its op in arena. A tip is to farm up mats and gold for the sf class and when the class come you decide if you wanna play the class after testing the class out. You probably wont continue playing the class if its not fun so wait with deciding the main class for it to be released ,bladeandsoul,d3rhdx4,7,t5_2skd6
7789691,0,t3_4lyl02,I made my FM the day the game launched and I had no idea what to expect. Since often played mage andor healers in RPGs it seemed to be the class that came the closest. I remember it was pretty rare to see one in parties or while leveling up. I began to see a shift in FMs when people started to farm BW and Terrors and started realizing FMs tended to be the class that could get boxes the easiest. The patch where they made the Burn build even more viable to allow  uptime made your DPS spike massively.Then SSP came and all of a sudden when I queue for parties in dungeons theres a high chance of  or  FMs and  or  Summs plus  or  WL. Maybe with proper optimization patches people will feel more comfortable going back to melee but its definitely way too punishing for them now. The main reason all my three characters are ranged lol.,bladeandsoul,d3rm94r,1,t5_2skd6

You make more money with your time by running dungeons until stingers become less than half the value of moonstones. I could duo SSP on my sin in TW servers.

I always make sure to have at least  weapon gems before upgrading which has saved me TONS of gold.As per the ember I ran asura man with my guild only the rule being we each get one. So I literally paid c for the ember so I only run man for the gold and the ember hasnt dropped since QQ. The reason I have so little gold is my playtime and mentality. I can only play maybe  hours per day. I set grind goals which I meet daily so my income comes from gold rewards and drops I dont bid on. If I were to sell everything I make I could earn around G per day in those  hours but I keep it since I try to cut costs whenever.It may be a flawed model I know but its allowed me to enjoy the game and not feel burnt out from so much grinding.,bladeandsoul,d4dc0we,0,t5_2skd6

8102271,0,t3_4q5cvb,Hardcore ff player here that was literally involved in incredibly fast decision making and timings that could split hairs since the start of . until ..The combat system is very slow to start but at the end has you doing a lot. It turns into hardcore skillcommand weaving between your global cooldowns whilst respecting animations all whilst positioning as smartly as you can. If anyone tells you that the combat system is slow try playing an endgame scholar white mage black mage ninja or monk keep in mind that outside of endgame content you will not be pushed to maximize the usage time outside of your on the dot gcds so it will seem slow or even easy there. That said its still your typical tab targeting system. I ended up taking a very extended break due to life  running into horrible players all the time... its incredibly noticeable to see people who have been pushed to being comfortable with maximizing their time and risks and those who have not... bad players are VERY noticeable.BnSs combat is completely different. Like... completely different. There are small individual gcds but most of your time is spent managing either your animations or your buffs. Its action oriented and the goal is to both pump out as much damage while avoiding or dodging as many mechanics as you can. No content in the game pushes you to do this. Its simply not difficult enough yet. That said you can only have  class on one character and is very second class unfriendly ff allows you to have everything on  character... because it treats classes as jobs that your character embarks on learning and BnS treats them as bloodlines. There is no trinity but that said every class has its own form of support alongside the obvious damage that it brings. Some forms of support are tanking party wide damage buffs cc stacking projectile nullification stealth barriers that resist hits healing and even the ability to mass res. Obviously the tanks will end up doing slightly less damage than everyone else but have buffs that enhance threat generation and its normal to bring one along to most dungeons but note that theyre also one of the hardest roles if not the hardest role to play in the game. In terms of balance. Honestly ff does it better. It makes more sense. First ff understands the difference between melee and ranged dps. Melee fights for uptime amp buff management and ranged fights for intelligent positioning targeting and buff management. The balance in BnS has the ranged outperforming melees not tanks in fights against your standard target dummy doesnt move or do any mechanics. Frankly its backwards but it seems that theyre trying to improve this? Second it seems that ff attempts to give better rewards to the content that engages their players the most. BnS on the other hand... theyre trying but the content that is most engaging isnt neccessarily the most rewarding. In fact some of the most fun parts of the game also some of the more difficult parts that really separate the men and women from the boys and girls are often just wastes of time when it comes to their gear treadmill.So if the balance is worse in terms of both class design and game design... why am I playing BnS? Well... my favorite part of ff were the raids but thats too much lifemental commitment for me at this moment in my life. BnS allows me to play a little bit more casually all while having an interesting challenging combat experience. Also because the challenge was important for me I picked and love kfm wind build ftw was included within the first  of Jiwans main BW tanks. That said Im not very rewarded for that challenge especially when there are classes who can perform better with both thumbs stuck up their butt and play with a controller upside down but its having fun that matters.Either way youll have a good experience. My two cents is to follow your friends. Playing with people is what makes mmos the most fun.,bladeandsoul,d4qro5h,1,t5_2skd6

If you feel your AP is low and dont want to LFP pug then go through a different angle. Farm Ivory Scales from Zaiwei and advertise your party most high AP characters wont mind you since youre fronting the entrance fee and you get an easy carry.Form your own party with adequate AP  is already overkill for everything available  is more than enough for the coming content until years end. Also if youre joining parties that exceed your current AP say  asking for  ask politely to join. Youd be surprised just how many people are willing to carry a newbie or two.TIP please and I repeat PLEASE dont try to dupe your party. If youre new to an instance then say so. Again people are willing to carry you so long as you dont make it hard for them. Dont try to stun the boss in Sundered Nexus if you dont know how or knockdown the twins in Soguns Lament. Learn from the more experienced people first then try to contribute.Lastly dont false advertise especially in Cold Storage. Dont ask for people  when youre only  or around.

Thats just her belief.Spoilers In the original KR story however she actually does go after Mushin for revenge. She justifies that her machinations are just to lure him out of hiding. This is because he unknowingly carries a fragment of the Dark Lord since he went into the Dark Realm and got pulled out by Yura which would subconsciously affect his decisions in summoning the Dark Lord he throws Yunwa toward the portal.

8406850,0,t1_d5s6321,No as I said this is the best assumption I can make based on the various reports people have posted of their evolution success rates added to my own.  The first three evolutions all were in the range plausible for  to be the actual evolution chance.  After that each evolution had fewer than twelve reported evolution attempts and so I couldnt actually say anything with actual statistical certainty margin of error for a survey of eleven or fewer is larger than  but each was still between  and  when they had four or more attempts.Again this is all very small datasets so this is partially guesswork hence my allowing people to download the spreadsheet themselves and change the probabilites as they see fit.  One thing I will say is that if NCSoft placed even the higherend success rates at  or lower then participating in this event wouldnt be worthwhile at all except for the cosmetic items the nebula stones arent worth it on their own so only the gems and the boss materials can make this worth it but the boss materials and comparable gems sell on the market for less than  gold so that places an approximate cap on how expensive they would be in the event... despite conspiracy theories NCSoft generally makes their events more generous than simply playing the game normally.,bladeandsoul,d5seh3u,1,t5_2skd6
8408605,1,t3_4usfvj,You appear to be doing something wrong.The economy is never good or bad it just is.That said your point about ssp channels isnt exactly accurate. There are as many channels as there need to be. Channels are dynamic and save for channel  and  only exist when the lower channels reach a certain player threshold. More players farming will cause more channels to exist and vice versa.Second this is no longer the only source of moonstones. You can get them from pouches which you get the needed transmutation materials from the new end game dungeons. Naksun and iron heart in Mushin tower also now drop moon stones.Stingers were needlessly expensive and this drop in price is good for more people than it is bad if you want to look at it as black and white. People who could otherwise obtain them can now do so at a reasonable price.The new end game dungeons are considered highly profitable and the new drops can be used to obtain moon stones.,bladeandsoul,d5smd61,0,t5_2skd6

8435374,0,t3_4v6qin,I complained about Profane weapon Wheel of Fate on this sub on the th June therefore its safe to assume that I have reached Level  on the th June or so.Reached   days ago and have g in mats banked.Most of my boosts come from daily challenge in the past few months while it lasted. Also when I was  I bought both LD and Block HM skills which made me an effective F tool because it allowed me to carry people through Nexus despite that I had never even done it before. Merchant event ahhh good times but it also set me back AP wise. Still when I whispered and asked   of the time a  AP would still invite me. Yet I still got carried through all of the dungeons at first. I can now do all CC in Nexus but it makes tanking at the same time very taxing and only need that if theres no s around but Im the one doing most of the carry.Also  AP gem  AP gem from event I still carry these and I will keep them for a while. All my crap is True Oathbreaker  but the weapon is Awakened Breeze. I see so MANY people with True Siren Necklace and Infernal Accessory and True Breeze weapon its hilarious. They pay g for their weapon and have shit accessories plz Its like they havent done anything but grind. Literally the only times I have grinded was in a week where I decided to level Soul Wardens. Im now doing daily Challenge and then just spam Shattered Masts out of  runs yesterday I had only one run where I didnt bid on the Silverfrost  Seed. Im also totally up for daily Asura and the occasional m but heres a warning stay away from that. Out of  runs in all dungeons the past week Ive seen a shitload of stingers only once.I have never done SSP also its dead on Ceru here noone does it anymore. People on our sever can make several thousand gold a week CrimsonOh ah and yeah Naryu labyrinth when you have  clears you get an achievement that lets you use  AP bonus  I think effectively without all the ninja shit I must be like  AP lolWith all that said my  Summoner has enough has cleared all dungeons. Comparing that to what I think might have been my BM back in the day imho the  is more than enough for anything even Nexus people usually dont wipe upon enrage. If theres  x  in the party to carry you and they complain they are only doubting their own dps. So I just ninja queue for recruiter flame the bads in Yeti do flower for quick daily and never die and I get my dailies P Summoner has gotten to level  on st July missed the costume  but if I did all dailies on that its another g. I do the daily challenge queue for CS Mandate and Gloom and then just leave back to BM.Shoutout to DPS meter btw finally an antiafk policy that I dont have to third party its a ressource hog.With all that said Ive received amazing help at everything no gold or mats mind you but people just seeing a new guy asking questions. Ill never forget the one BM who showed me Grand Harvest and the Gorgonzola in Plog telling me to do it every day. The XP from these events definitely helped with HM levels a lot which also increase AP.Also last but not least for the first two weeks of July I played a LOT.Btw theres no point in buying ANY mats as of now. Any gold you have should go into Moonstones for your upgrade and if you arent crafting Silverfrost Transformation Stones then thats another but apart from that by the time you have enough Moonstones for an upgrade you will also have the other mats. Ask yourself if  AP increase is worth it to spend all your gold or if you can wait another  hours and be sure to have the mats and dont have to buy them from the market.,bladeandsoul,d5vym0p,2,t5_2skd6

I joined saw everyone at around HM  and thought nothing more. We begin and as per other runs it shouldnt take more than  minutes to finish. However were near  minutes and still Winter Mane is at  HP. Finally the beast goes down and out of curiosity I check the party member stats.As it turns out the strongest member was me at AP by a BIIIIG margin. The next strongest was  the lowest . It finally dawns on me they were all clan members and probably baiting a stronger player into carrying them. I said nothing and left slightly salty at the fact of being used hmph! but now more cautious.I dont mind helping lower tier players but I do mind trying to con others into an easy carry. Once I had an Asura party with  requirement asking us to bring along a guildie who just hit . No one refused and the run was very smooth.

The reason why theyre strong isnt because of the damage but because they have multiple ways of returning to their combo or resetting the fight.I didnt write up something for a Sin outside a basic guideline as an FM is because the matchup is so dynamic.  It depends completely on your playstyle as well as how the Sin plays.  Its not feasible to write something out for Sins because a strategy that will work for one player wont work at all for another.OP is likely hitting into every DecoyStrafe the Sin is using which only works to either extend their CC chain hello Spinal Tap or give them breathing room with the invisibility.

8568934,0,t3_4x44et,Personally I leveled up with a horrible build but as a BM that played both Fire and Lightning currently at fire this is what I can tell you aboutFire is good if you have bad ping for you just have to RMB then LMB until you start losing focus and then RMB again for the easiest and laziest to work with fire. The only big problem when leveling up is that you lose an AOE which is lightning flicker lightning flicker is very good for managing plenty of mobs which you end up finding a lot in early game.Pierce is a move not many use unless absolutely lost say no way to enter draw stance for about  seconds you just poke a little with pierce so youre not doing nothing. So dont really bother on that technique for its not really the best no matter if youre lightning or fire you wont use that as much.Spec onto SS so you go onto draw stance its a must and will serve you a lot.What Id say perhaps is to do a firelightning hybrid as you level up until your crit is high and such with dragon tongue  lightning flicker so you have your focus and your AoE at least thats how I would do it if I was leveling up a new BM.Flash step is important and DEFINITELY blade call when you get it take it out of flock of blades ASAP because Blade call will be very useful for you.Im not sure on what else to say for Im not sure as to what exact pointers you need but I hope I could help a little.,bladeandsoul,d6cp4cr,2,t5_2skd6

Them changing the amount of the discount reversed that which makes it completely relevant its a reversal not a continuation of what it was to begin with.

8978372,0,t1_d7qu7qo,BMs can use boot shoulder charge lightning retribution to break his counters. I think you can also just penta into it if you dont wanna change stances.Ice falling phase is after . Periodically he jumps to mid. There are  things you need to iframe and  thing you need to blockparrycounteriframe. Iframe the pull. My visual cue for this is to watch the blue trail that circles around him when he begins the pull animation. When it reaches a  circle then you can iframe it. Iframe the explosion. My visual cue is about half a second after he stops spinning from the pull animation. Iframe the icicles. After the explosion he will start a hit flurry combo that ends with a knockup. After the st hit icicles will start to fall randomly around the area. They are usually lethal and as far as I can tell there is no way to tell where exactly they will fall so the safe thing to do is to always iframe them. This is the one where you want to use a longer iframe because the icicles dont all land at the same time. Blockparrycounteriframe the last hit of his flurry combo otherwise it will knock you into the air and you are dead.Typically you can facetank the st and rd hits of his combo. The nd hit will usually get absorbed by the same iframe that you used for icicles. rd hit might also get absorbed depending on how long the iframe is.BMs can block the first hit cyclone ndrdicicles block th hit.

When you start the game up the first time after booting it takes longer but after that Windows keeps the files in unused RAM to access them faster. This happens with all programs you use.You have two ways to combat this problem. Get an SSD and put all your essential to load fast things on it Samsung  EVO is a solid choice. Dont shut down your computer completely use hibernation sleep or hybrid sleep.

9479656,0,t3_5am9yu,Your opener is fine just save Dragonblaze for when he jumps then Force Blast in order to secure the s burn during fire AOEs.  Make sure Dual Dragons is on CD during this time as you need the Dragonblaze projectile due to travel time in order to guarantee a correct timing on embers  Force Blast.If youre having trouble pushing through phases as youve said at  then just take the extra second or two to guarantee a burn debuff.Also note that you dont need the s resist potion during the fire phase just stay m away. One thing Id say is to use Fire Fury during the third AOE then toss out Dragonblaze at ish meters and qe iframe the explosion.  You can Force Blast immediately after to continue the burn debuff with  downtime unless you have wonky phase pushes.With the new Force Blast  Inferno change youll be able to fit in another XVX at around the  jump phase.,bladeandsoul,d9hklbs,1,t5_2skd6

9511548,0,t3_5b3e5s,As someone whos been trying to learn how to mark properly as a ranged class done it  times now and is willing to volunteer for the role in pugs Ive come to realise one thing. You will ALWAYS be blamed for anything that happens. If someone gets knocked back further than your position  you will get blamed for being a bad marker if they get it. If someone  such as a melee stands waaay to close to the boss at  even though they arent supposed to we still get blamed. Even if you got mark but either a  or  didnt get the orb intime resulting in killing you you still get blamed and called a bad marker. In every run Ive ever been as a marker weve still cleared with plenty of time on the clock but regardless I still get lecturered about being a bad marker. Orginally I listened with open ears so I can try to improve myself. But at this point its gotten silly with how repative it is. This just goes to show that its not that people are resilient to mark its just that no one wants to be the guy who gets blamed for everything. Quite frankly after having to deal with pugs and their nonesense for so long and finally getting my necklace for an affordable price. I wont even ever bother being marker again since its not worth the headache and having to be blamed for everything.

10331184,0,t3_5myb4c,Recently getting back into the game remembering why I fell in love with it a year ago.I tried out Soul Fighter since it was the new shiny class and boy I do enjoy it. It seems to be crazy good at solo play with all the iframes easy cc and damage. However I realise that in party play lateendgame they generally dont offer very much outside DPS and later in patches will become unwanted. My question is should I continue with Soul Fighter since I really enjoy it or should I invest in Warlock because I enjoy it less but it will always be desired in parties? I would move to KFM but I really dislike the stress of tanking previous BM main. How badly will Soul Fighters be unwanted in say the current KR patch?Thanks!,bladeandsoul,dcf3ij3,2,t5_2skd6

Then slapped Time Bomb which refreshes poison duration and can be detonated instantly with Mine Toss.gt Also he does it again at  but he had  choke bomb up too why not use it instead to proc the tiger bracelet?Choke Bomb reduces Time Bombs cooldown by  seconds hes trying to conserve it for that.gt In general im still debating on what element to prioritize for BTs elemental accessories Its true Lightning has significantly higher damage output what with the absurdly high Lightning Rod modifiers and  crit damage bonus from stealth however the biggest problems with Lightning are that Lightning Rod is very hard to anicancel and they do absolutely no damage when not in stealth. Its very easy to get kicked out of stealth for seemingly no reason for example Lord of the Flames lightning ball and conducting chain both remove stealth and Zakhans beginning and ending of Heavens Breach both remove stealth. Despite the fact that Lightning is stronger its very inconsistent because there are key moments where they are  denied from stealth and thus will literally do no damage. Dark is more consistent and ChokmaRaven weapon and BT accessories provide the means for stable critfocus. The build itself is also much more versatile since they dont rely on stealth majority of the time.KR can easily afford to have both Lightning and Dark equips since they have a higher pay grade from quests and such and its been out for  years but Lightning Sins are a rare breed there because of their most glaring weaknesses.Its all preference really personally I pick Dark because of its consistency and versatility.,bladeandsoul,dcyztax,5,t5_2skd6

The item discount in the trove is huge so it will generally crash the market price for alot of items thats where your gold worth more and you can spend your gold to buy stuff more efficently. The next trove is gonna be around march but thats just my guessThe  of crit is as high as possible but around  crit chance is good enough for me personally warlocks with low crit is just horrible to play with. You need  accuracy to not miss your attacks and  to not miss your attacks in Naryu Foundry but thats a long way to go so aim for  first.

Now they basically made it so you just click as fast as you can or well if youre smart use R instead of LMB and just spam RFBlade dancer are far more versatile. Their Z X and V can all be specd differently depending on your skill and familiarity with the dungeon. Z is either a huge dps boost or a massive iframe for yourself. X is either another iframe or a boost in dps V is either a really good iframe a double cc or a massive hard hitting ability.

10664195,0,t1_ddfsdv5,Who cares? This is a totally unrealistic scenario. Plus its not really possible to measure since the DPS meter is only enabled in dungeons. Suffice to say every single class can put out enough damage to make their presence in the group worthwhile and every class also has something extra they bring to the party beyond DPS. Also remember effective damage is often not shown on the meter. When I grip a boss the party DPS increases drastically for a few seconds and my DPS does not. That extra DPS that Im responsible for isnt credited to me but its helpful all the same. Similar deal with Warlock Soulburn and KFMSin blue buff or BM tanking or what have you. DPS isnt everything in any game and its even less important in BNS than most. ,bladeandsoul,ddfxi1p,0,t5_2skd6

Be aware that the first msp pieces you get under I think  or greater dont have crit as the base stat so you need to infuse crit primers to them and also you lose crit with  and  asura.                      MSP  set gives you a  boost to your blazing beam which I believe comes after the burn and db buff damage calculation.                        ,bladeandsoul,dec6nhe,0,t5_2skd6
10977095,0,t1_dec20ok,Clearly there is no point discussing this with you as you prefer to grandstand instead of actually discussing the issue at hand youve shown yourself to be an increadibly dishonest participant in this little debate weve been having with this sentance. You say its your opinion and yes it is do you know why? We were disagreeing on what was the definition of active you call yourself someone who logs in for minh per day and more on the weekend active and I gave you my definition of active and now you try to turn this around asking for evidence of my DEFINITION. I dont need evidence to explain what message I am trying to bring across when I say the word active have you never debated or argued before? To avoid confusion one has to first establish what we are talking about and what we mean with certain words but you either clearly do not understand that or are just being dishonest while trying to push an agenda.You also  ignored everything I said economy issues issues that the playerbase will face while upgrading and proposed solutions which is why I am leaning more towards the dishonest possibility than towards the innocent mistake. I base my opinion on what I know is achievable with what kind of gear and on the cost of upgrades it doesnt take a genius to calculate that. Thats probably the closest to Evidence based we will get here. example  if you earn g per day since september which is insanly easy you will have earned g by now. Currently fully upgrading a weapon to Stage  will cost you around about g and reaching Stage  will cost you about g each accesory will cost you about g. So by simply earning g per day for  months you could easly reach Stage  with true boss access. You have been playing for more than one year now and you are nowhere near Stage  and thats fine you be you but dont call yourself active when you are very clearly in the casual category of PvE I personally wouldnt even call g per day active thats like  dungeons and Mushins ? But we we are done here when people dont have arguments anymore they start asking for evidence of definitions lol.,bladeandsoul,dec8izk,2,t5_2skd6

10987513,0,t3_5wqkg6,Welcome to the grind! No cookies though.As a saying goes Jack of all trades master of none this is something to be avoided at all costs.My recommendation would be Get Hongmoon soul. Either grind out the Oath weapons or money to buy them or grind out the feathers in Heavens Mandate. Get sould up to at least level  for a nice AP but beware of expense. Its quite large. Get upgradeable pet. Or any pet for that matter at least to start. Upgrade to at least to level  for a nice HP boost. Do ALL purple dailies even if you have to LFP it good luck xD. Its easy gold and XP and it accumulates over time. Only doing your  dailies is paramount but expand on it or money will be tight. Get your MSP soulshield. To start Asura  and YetiBe Ido  are good. Ideally youd want a mixture of Elder and Challenger which gives great stats and a significant HP boost but this will take time to farm. Always do your daily Tower of Infinity for random loot and badges which are very useful for your skills. Once youre above  or  start camping Ebondrake Citadel  Desolate Tomb to grind out your legendary accesories. Even if you cant afford to bid on them at first youll make better money when they drop or on Honoraries. Farm out Naksun or SSP for soulstones and moonstones. You need quite a lot and theyre not exactly cheap at the moment. Grind out your HM skills. Depending on your class some may be pivotal while others utterly useless. And thats about it. Prioritize your character growth and learn dungeon mechanics. I cant count how many times a party has failed because people with high ap never bothered to learn mechanics and wipe on the first bosses. Dont try to overreach. This is a point that takes a long time to overcome and is always a necessity. Fall into a comfortable routine and youll be upgrading at regular intervals.Above all else have fun! This is a game not a job. Youll run into trolls newbs griefers good players and lag take it all in stride let it help you grow into a better gamer and youll fall right into what the game was designed to be entertaining.,bladeandsoul,dedeemf,1,t5_2skd6

11058122,0,t3_5xwbn1,I understand your anger toward it yes ive been beaten tons of times by ppl using ridiculous gear in this game i am a ap casual fp player. I know i wont get that item any time soon or at all. That been said here is the point.    You DONT need that item nor need a lot of legendary gear to clear the actually content. Let me explain why something like this is even in game atm.Why this item exist?  Ncsoft is a company and they need to make money to keep the game alive they need to give incentive to ppl to pay for the game. The pressure on the devs and ppl working there is real in any company the owners need to see the profit.But why this item so powerful?  This is a heavy skill based game i can beat ppl with ap in v ive been playing for a long time so my skills are not bad. Now how do you think a person who payed thousands of money to have a good gear been beaten by someone with lower gear?.Is not good for the company itself Ncsoft. They need to make ppl who pay feel like they are actually getting something good from it or no one will buy right?.So yea they need to give ppl an overpowered item wich helps them skip the skill needed to make them feel their money is not wasted.That been said this game is really good and as a fp i apreciate that ppl are willing to pay for it. But you must undertand the ppl with full gear are very few in this game and they keep this game alive Ncsoft been taken adventage over gamblers is another topic wich i wont discuss here.Why do they release such item so soon?  The other reasons i gave are part of it but mostly every game starts like this and ends like this start easy to gear and gets slowly more harder to get gear. This game gear from other regions is really expensive and absurd to even think even getting there. So this game population is gonna fall slowly as they release updates as i said every update will be harder to gear the company Ncsoft need to take advantage while they still have a decent population in game i dont agree on ncsoft taking advantage of players but then again i wont discuss that here.I hope this helps you understand a bit more about how this business works yes for them is business.Lastly i want to remind you this is a game have fun chill out with friends sadly this is how games are designed mmos if u are not having fun there are a lot of other games out there i hope u find something that can make u happy if u quit this game. Good luck.,bladeandsoul,delf4ip,19,t5_2skd6

11120005,0,t1_des9au0,Id humor you and provide specifics but Im not going to reinstall Revelation amp the other pertinent games just to win a petty argument on reddit. I will however point you in the right direction to start looking. A bunch of armors in the game have their base meshes from BampS outfits. Some hairstyles have been lifted from BampS TERA and Aion and slightly altered. Walk cycles are slightly altered from BampS walk cycles. Some mobs have had their base model and various animations taken from BampS too. Near the end of the tutorial island you fight a mob that has its base model and some animations taken directly from BampS King Kaari boss. If you know how to extract and view the models you can verify what I am saying yourself. In the first dungeon you might have noticed they took a Kobold sound clip from FFXIV for one of the mob types if you have played that game.Ever learned in school that copypasting an essay and then modifying a few words to make it sound legit is still plagiarism? Well thats what is going on in Revelation.This wouldnt be the first time a Chinesemade game has used stolen assets though.

RMB Flame Palm TS LMB Frost Palm TS  Blazing Beam TSLMB gt RMB gt  repeat.At Lv you spec  Force Blast TS for Burn debuff which gives you bonus Flame damage on certain skills for  seconds and then it will need to be reapplied.Next is a short list of milestone skills in order of importance X Inferno TS instant cast with Force Blast on  ember enemy very big damage hard cast for instaburn V Meteor Shower TS good damage with burn C Short Fuse TS instaburn focus regen Casting a non MB move causes a  sec global cooldown so its in your best interest to weave RMB and LMB between every large spell cast.FM relies on kiting enemies so changing Frost Palm to TS can help mitigate damage by not allowing enemies to move  chill stack blocks most advancetype skills  chill stacks results in a  second snare.   ,bladeandsoul,df2oj1p,1,t5_2skd6

11555748,0,t3_64x1w4,I know you said to not convince you about fire dps but the dragon bracelet benefits fire more than lightning while the tiger bracelet benefits lightning more than fire.The lightning anicancel speed is about .s per lbrb. So  seconds of tiger allows for  rbs while  seconds of dragon allows for  rbs. So the question is can you activate tiger  times over  seconds?The answer is most likely yes. You need the F badge that lowers lightning draw cd on an rb crit during V. So you can start with ZV when V ends your  is back and most likely raven cd reset is soon too which will give you another .So there are basically no real difference between the two except that tiger needs the new F soul badge. If you are worried about chi management and want to stick with the flicker badge then go dragon. If you think you can take care of your chi with the BT mystic amulet then use whichever you want.,bladeandsoul,dg5ujb5,2,t5_2skd6

11558531,0,t3_64mx4b,Well seraph used to get a buff from getting hit so now that its been changed to the same damage dealing mech as Baleful people are starting to wonder if it its viable now on SF.In my opinion it is not. When you look at the stats the few things that seraph has going against it remain. The primary two offenders being you regain health with seraph per hit and you get CD reduction on your Z. The primary problem is these two stats.Any player facing a new boss will have to get used to the fight and the rotation. You cant expect to dodge every attack meaning that the HP regen from seraph could come in handy at first. But after an extended experience with the boss youll get hit less and less as your skill with the boss increases and you find youre able to get more damage in as well as take less hits. So that being said the additional effect that seraph provides although useful at first youll find becoming wasted over time. You HP wont drop often when you get used to a rotation and when it does you have necessary skills to heal yourself without the use of the seraph effect. Its nothing you want to trade for the damage increase that bale users will be utilizing with every hit.Now the Z CDR. Keep in mind that the cooldown of focus is a full minute a moderate waiting time reduced by a measly  seconds with the CDR. At max rank seraph shines brighter as the cooldown reduction is doubled but even then youre going to be waiting  seconds for a mere  seconds of buff time enough to utilize your V and F skills. This is not bad in fact its quite a good buff but when you look at baleful it buffs the damage for a skill thats going to be over  of your damage. In long and short you dont need to be studious to see which one will provide better effectiveness in an extended battle.There are a few justifiable reasons to use seraph though. Some being if you have high ping youre into PvP and dont want Galaxy ToI survivability and if youre... bad at dodging I guess.Theyre both good but seraph is more situational and Id recommend Baleful if youre planning on running PvE often.I hope I helped.,bladeandsoul,dg65wlj,2,t5_2skd6

If you are the only blue buffer in your group go dark. Overall though its personal preference.Also you can always switch your bracelet to the other tree.

11626424,0,t3_65vw6s,Here are some constructive criticism for your test. You need to include a video. We cant tell if you are simply better with one build than the other or if you are playing optimally in your tests.. You point this out yourself you are not using the bis gear for either build. The thing is people want to know the potential of each build before they commit to one of them with BT accessories mystic amulets legendary bracelets. If someone has the gear in your test they can play lightning or fire with no cost. It is the bidding and upgrading of BT accessories and the  feathers for the mystic amulet that makes people pause and decide.. Same thing with crittrue soul. A crit dragontongue does way more than a noncrit dragontongue while the difference for honed slash is much less.In conclusion your test does not really answer the important question for the current blademasters who need to decide which element to go for. It is more like a goodtoknow thing.By the way it is completely natural for LBgtRB in lightning build since you can cancel lightning draw with LB.,bladeandsoul,dgdv8f5,11,t5_2skd6

Have you put your new HM Points into Offense in your character screen P by default?  I have a few AP gems but that only accounts for maybe  of my AP so you should be upper s if not over AP I would think.  At  AP you should be able to run everything up to Ebondrake Citadel and MAYBE Desolate Tomb.
