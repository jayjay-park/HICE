11063693,0,t1_delqcce,I am in Switzerland so it might be different? And I wasnt using it as a charger but I was using it for the fan heater. The item itself was faulty because it went through  Adapters.  At least I think it is faultyI tried shutting down the breakers but getting the adapter out was difficult. It wouldnt budge. Could this cause a fire? I think Ill try to get an electrician to come asap.,HomeRepair,dem1vux,1,t5_32k1h
