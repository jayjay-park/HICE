Perform the following  steps  times in a rowTurn off the light for  secondsTurn on the light for  secondsAs soon as you see the bulb flash once you can stop the above sequence. The bulb should dim and then turn back on when reset. Once it is reset try to add the bulb with your preferred Hue app.,huelights,cny2id1,3,t5_2vp40

3444930,0,t3_2zm8nv,Ive heard one or two users around here claim that that happened when one of the colored LEDs inside burnt out. See if theres a specific color range that you cant access with that lamp. That might tell you if one of the LEDs has burned out inside.,huelights,cpky43d,1,t5_2vp40

I am living in the f future!!!!Now I just need to figure out how to run this thing on my jailbroken AppleTV instead of Mac and this would be amazing and usable in real life instead of just as an experiment.Unfortunately the MyTouchHome app is not very intuitive in adding scenes to it. I wanted to replicate my iConnectHue scenes.This is how to do it Set the scene you want to copy Connect through the Hue API debug web interface and query the lamp info Conver the queried values into the values MyTouchHome expects brightness and saturation in  and hue in degreesGetting Lamp ValuesConnecting to API through BrowserVisit  IPgtdebugclip.htmlCreate userPress link button and then send HTTP PostURL apiMessage Body username fbcddcadeebf devicetype testPress the POST buttonfbcddcadeebf is the md sum of test it is also your API key  username from now onQuery Lamp DataURL apifbcddcadeebflightsMessage Body Doesnt matterPress the GET buttonConverting API Values to MyTouchHomeBrightness bribri .Hue huehue... degreeSaturation satsat.Next on Get this thing working on my jailbroken AppleTV so it doesnt depend on my macbook.,huelights,cqq9grx,2,t5_2vp40

5192452,0,t1_cvbub1h,The Philips scenes are stored on the bridge so that should work most of the time. You might have to periodically refresh because bridge scenes work more like a cache than permanent storage. I never saw the purge rules described.,huelights,cvbvtlb,1,t5_2vp40
