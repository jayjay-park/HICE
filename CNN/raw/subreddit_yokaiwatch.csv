Oh and as a side note your scaling on the flair seems to be a bit off. Are you doing it with bicubic or something like it? Its not very smooth at the moment and it could be.

5640683,0,t3_3sd0oj,I think I understand where youre coming from I hate Japanese Anime culture. Its a whole subset that is not something I can get into. YoKai Watch has its heavy basis of Japanese culture rooted in mythology and day to day life of Japan. If you like Pokemon I think you would like YoKai Watch  I find the tone and humor is similar to Pokemon at times. Theres no monster girls no senpai notice me or strong anime tropes that disrupted me during my play through. I think you have a good shot of enjoying it if you like Pokemon  just know that beyond the tone and fighting monsters that it is quite different gameplay very enjoyable though.

It took a while but I would recommend just rolling along those  trees on graduate street dont go past the train track part where it turns into whateverthatother street is hitting them up when your meter says its a Crank then popping back into uptown and resetting the trees til you get him.

I still think youd see the same six Yokai on everyones team with very little variation only because theres little room for variation without being underpowered compared to that best team. And then some battles would be up to the luck of an unfortunate loaf or  fortunate attack at just the right time.edit You know if they were to add the rule of no Legendary Yokai similar to Pokemon maybe I could see that increasing some variation but I still feel youd see the same SRank Yokai on every team.,yokaiwatch,cx28alw,3,t5_32oeb

5711860,0,t3_3taw5k,Snartle scales up depending how far you are in the story. Hes easier then if you grind levels early in the game without advancing the story itself. I had gotten to watch rank D and opened up Blossom Heights. I then ground out levels until my team was all between levels . I had gotten  pieces of bacon from a quest reward and they were the best meat I had snartles favorite food type. I saved my game before crossing the road for a th time and triggering him. Then I just restarted the game every time I didnt befriend him so I could keep using that bacon.My team was Jibanyan Cadable Noko BakuEspy from Crank a Kai and Komajiro. I also had a crap load of hunks of bread from the bakery for healing as well as my healers.

5717962,0,t1_cx5jvt9,Hello! Ill try to help but Im admittedly not the best player there is. But here we go.First things first Id suggest going through this thread  theres some good advice Ive gotten here. Knights posts have been very helpful and this one too so Id suggest reading them over and taking their advice. Basically try to go back to the beginning and catch as many Youkai as you can try to assemble a team from the same tribe or with as many Youkai from the same tribe as you can and train them and level up as much as you can. If a team doesnt work just switch  try a lot of configurations and see what works!Ive been stumbling through the game too but I think Im getting the hang of it  and really I think that once you get used to it it becomes easier to see how to connect them to bring the ones you want closer to each other and see how to form longer combos for example. Catch Youkai train them switch your team and dont worry about trying to rush through the stages.I struggled with level  too but i beat it last night. I gathered a team of heavy hitters and tried to have a lot of finishers when I triggered fever  and then I didnt try to gather more I just kept pressing as many as I could to cause as much damage as I could. It was what worked for me but it did require training and a lot of attempts that ended with me hitting a wall so dont be discouraged!,yokaiwatch,cx5vayj,1,t5_32oeb

That aside I think youre doing both series a disservice to deny the similarities. To me at least its obvious how much inspiration Yokai Watch took from Pokemon. Im not just talking about the way the game plays though there are quite a few similarities there but the games style and its feel. Not that I think thats a bad thing on the contrary most great series take inspiration from others. Yokai Watch is unique in very many ways and I dont see it as a Pokemon ripoff at all. Just a game in the same genre that took a few cues from Pokemons successes. ,yokaiwatch,cyizjw2,-1,t5_32oeb

I find it easier to restart the match once Whapir doesnt show up and or exiting and reentering the stage. Also try to knockout Whapir with a single Fever Time Draggie included. I happened to do this for Payn and ended up getting the Generals Soul. Tried the same method and I got the Ageless Powder from Whapir as well.

7554529,0,t1_d30vi3m,Indeed aware of Exporbs as well and Soul Secrets are technically a Recruit but certainly a waste of use unless using them on Legends! Baddinyan is Crank Exclusive pretty sure? As for rates it seems there are two major backets ED and BAS for difficulty. As I said in the OP I threw  Candy Apples with a Max Soultimate Shmoopie at Frostina with no luck. It appears that the higher the Rank of the Yokai the less numbers are changed to Recruiting cases. I cant exactly pinpoint this multiplier as everything in there is named under single letters except Strings to entail the algorithms outputs so I can only base this upon data of hundreds of runs across Peegeray Leafy and I. My data shows a sharp drop off with Rank B and higher which seems to plateau with A and S Rank. Ill edit the OP to include Soul Secrets as well for completion.,yokaiwatch,d30wwsu,1,t5_32oeb

8421360,0,t1_d5ts6p5,I finally got Oracanos once today probably after about  times on Ultra Terror in Chance Time and with best meat and the other fruitynyans except for the watermelon one crankakai exclusive?. Just wondering Did you use any befriending soultimate yokai against him? What is your Orcanos team? Ive been using a healer and a powerful rearranger like Damona in case he turns everything black.Orcanos soultimate at level  is pretty weak so I wonder whether there is any point spending all that time grinding to upgrade his soultimate to max any idea how powerful it would be?. At this rate I cant see how it is possible to befriend him  times in a little over  weeks and I dont intend to spend any Soul Secrets on him.At the moment more interested in befriending Mircle and Baddinyan to max out their soultimates and get them out of the crank but given their befriending rates I wonder if it is more economical to go back to grinding massiface for Ymoney instead. Wouldnt mind grinding Goldenyan either to get his soultimate up as I might need a powerful healer down the track but Ive beaten him  times so far with chocolate and Dandoodle to no avail.,yokaiwatch,d5u7nss,1,t5_32oeb

9159687,0,t3_55rbhn,I beat her about an hour ago heres what helped me.Silly tips. if you play in fast forward mode just turn it off. as soon as I did that it helped me a ton.. When youre purifying make sure to keep an eye on what shes up to. she likes to do a soul steal right after inspiriting everyone finders keepers because she can get off the full attack without being bothered.now if youre like me and saved over when you had revives and were left with only a few or none here are some more serious options. I would straight out avoid using soultimates. she can steal them when you charge it up and use her own which is way stronger than yours.. the jury is out on if you should take out the dragon noodles or not personally I stopped bothering. the dragons are able to siphon away your strength making your moves do less damage and I am about  percent sure killing one off will regenerate your strength back. however it will also come back after a period of time. some people say it makes her stronger as well but I didnt notice a difference. I personally stopped taking them out because they were sort of red herrings for me. Plus they regenerate so quickly it just got frustrating.. Her soul steal attack is the most frustrating each little soul she takes tends to do about  damage each. take them out with your target or at least take most of them out. I found taking the battle out of fast forward mode made this waaaay easier.. Level wise Id suggest low forties for your strongest guys and mid thirties for your weakest. its pretty easy to grind in that area.My team washogun jibanyan betterfly tunatic flamurice sooper hero.

9185840,0,t3_5656lf,You know how people dismiss YoKai Watch as a Pokmon clone?  I feel that Pokmon SUMO contains a lot of elements inspired from YoKai Watch . A main Cat character with a fire element amp Ghost with an info pad as a constant companion. See the picture. . Zmoves mimic the high amount of Body Language from summoning YoKai amp their specific poses. . The Zring is a YoKai Watch equivalent. . The overworld in SUMO seems to be a lot more exploratory adventurous and has more favorsquests compared to previous titles esp. with the introduction of riding Pokmon collecting Zygarde cells and the overhaul in the D overworld. . Alolan forms remind me of recolored YoKai or are inspired by Jibanyans many forms. . There seems to be a greater focus on friendship with Pokmon in SUMO with the grooming feature and Pok Box island feature. I know PokeAmie focused on friendship back in  but it seems to be a more prevalent theme in SUMO. I feel the advertising is also focusing more on friendship. . New and creative names using different punctuation ex. Type Null Tapu Koko etc.. . The use of QR codes to index Pokmon. Im sure there are many other similarities and even more will be evident with SUMOs release. Post any more I may have missed or if you agreedisagree with this. Im not trying to create animosity towards Pokmon Im just pointing out something I find interesting. I could be overthinking this but I do think YWs success in Japan had an influence on the game development of SUMO. I remember watching a prediction video from the YoTuber Gaijin Goomba where he predicted more Japanese themes in SUMO to win back their Japanese audience and compete with YW. ,yokaiwatch,d8gdeu4,1,t5_32oeb

Its sad bc the top playersnot that I have anyting against themmind you. really arent happy with their spots. And have to try so hard that after a certain point if you kinda dont have good enough fingers you are just behind by a ton.  Thing is top  people are always the same. and they cant increase the amount untill more people have the game and play score attack.its sad,yokaiwatch,denbtob,3,t5_32oeb

11620361,0,t1_dgd5y31,I know what you mean! The fat guy is so freakin rare as a crank pull and even worse its not guaranteed  The ticket pulls can be annoying since its entirely luck based with pulling the ticket then befriending the oldfashioned way ugh Heads up to any who do manage to pull the pass this dude loves sushi.This event is torture. All of these yokai in the tournament from score attack bosses to event exclusivesrare crank pulls and you cant befriend them at all. Whyyyyyyy u u,yokaiwatch,dgd6g31,1,t5_32oeb
11660241,0,t3_65onou,Awesome idea! Im a prop makerfabricator and when I was crafting while actively collecting Yokai merchandise I never thought of simply doing this to help my issues with the official Hasbro binders not being big enough to hold the foam inserts pages both the plastic pockets and gloss printed medal info pages and the damn medals as well.  ....mada mada.I actually just started crafting again today and this is now on my list of propscrafts to be finished tonight....Im going all out! Big binder detailedreplicated official exterior design medals in pocket pages gloss printed medal info sheets that will be edited for size differences between binder selection and based on personal organization preferences but to stick close to Hasbros released ones.Im sooo pumped! Ill have images to come and also will credit those that wantshould be credited. Also also I have a huuuuge amount of series  Yokai blind bag medals I should be making a post of it soon for any of those interested in them.,yokaiwatch,dghpbku,3,t5_32oeb
