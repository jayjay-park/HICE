2106327,0,t3_2j0ifx,I heard or read somewhere I dont remember where  that they looked specifically for a Rick Moranisesque actor for this video.  When Rick Moranis found out hr asked them why they didnt just ask him to do it as hes a huge Dan fan.  So thats why hes in the video for Tomorrows Girls.,SteelyDan,cl7k5zq,3,t5_2s642
2191077,0,t3_2k3j4t,Agreed. I love all the added harmony hits horn parts backup singers and the general tightness of the band. The thing that always gets me the most though is the keyboard intro I like it a lot more than the guitar intro in the real version. Theyve played this song all three times I saw them live and I wish they used this arrangement still!,SteelyDan,clic88m,2,t5_2s642
