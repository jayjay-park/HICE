10096354,0,t3_5gfjzc,The Xbox one controller with a  nyko phone clip makes a perfect OTG controller when paired with the usbbt joystickcenter app or moonlight game streaming to use the Nvidia Shield protocol and play PC games on your phone. My Moga pocket is outlasting my Moga pro power which now has a software seemingly unfixable drift in the left joystick. I am considering buying a Moga Pro as with a Bluetooth controller I can plug my phone in and not worry about battery issues.,Moga,dbnkinp,1,t5_2zv96
