5508700,0,t3_3qdvuo,EDITEveryone starts where youre at ... seriously if they dont  they got that starting jitters experience before going in to the industry.Best advice ever received ... just relax.  Why?  ...because eventually youll be fine about it.  Faking being relaxed casual helps let the other person youre having to talk to know what to expect  it sets up the conversation before you even say anything. Eventually youll have this confidence and no need to prove anything.  Also it doesnt matter what your bosses tell you  dont chase.  Maybe get plates if you can without confronting them outside if you dont confront them inside dont bother in my humble opinion.  If I were to get plates I would casually walk out the door and pretend to ignore the person till they got in their car  which sounds like you are kind of doing already.  When I was at home depot at least  years ago  we had two guys who were Olympic development program members one for weight lifting.  They bled orange the home depot color.  A call goes out from a cashier as they are standing around about possible shoplifter who walked through cash registers without buying anything  it was legit.  These two guys begin to hustle after the person  who speeds up his walk to a trot.  I walk over to the door to see if they are going to take this guy down.  When I get their I see this dude running from the two Olympic athletes amp hes got something in one arm cradled while holding his pants in the other was sagging them before when he left.  He gets to a car and has to slow down  the driver throws open door amp the shoplifter throws the item in the vehicle amp pulls a sidearm.  The distance is maybe  feet to these two and when the guy turns around with the sidearm they are both veering off in separate directions.  The guy fires two shots that I could tell both of them claimed it was  later on.  No one hit but scared the bejeezes out of all of us amp the customers who were in the parking lot  one little old couple we sat down on a bench and opened some food off the display for because they were shaking so badly.This wasnt a bad area  no violence ever recorded before at this home depot.  I guess instead of scaring you  Im trying to say dont escalate the situation  you never know if someone is just having a bad day or really unhinged.  I was trying to see if the news article was still out there amp saw that recently home depot had another shooting .... Link  Then an armed woman chases a shop lifter in a home depot parking lot  weeks ago ... Link ... shes probably going to be charged  as no ones safety was imminently at risk until the idiot loss prevention sprints out after the shop lifter amp she starts shooting.  Would not be surprised if the loss prevention person is fired too.  EDIT  NM they did charge her ... LinkEdit   Looks like yes Home Depot still fires people for chasing shoplifters ...

9833366,0,t3_5g1ja2,Part of my weekend job is to do a once over of the bar make sure the lights are off make sure no ones passed out in he freezer etc. Keep in mind I was only maybe a month into the job when this happened. The bar is three floors in total the top floor is only rented out for private parties and such but I always make a point of checking anyway. After all thats done I go to the back door to set the alarm and head to my car but as I press arm it says theres motion on the third floor so I cant set it. This also happens if I forget to shut a door sometimes so I head back up and pass through the second floor to check the door on the third but as Im doing so I distinctly hear footsteps coming from the third floor a real god fucking dammit moment. So I put on my bum gloves hoping the drunk I missed would leave without an issue. Im sure you can see where this is going I turn on every light up there and theres no one there and then turn on every light in the building and search it top to bottom just in case. Found no one killed the lights set the alarm and started heading to my car parked on the street. The bay window for the top floor faces the street and I happened to look up as I was getting in my car and saw someone standing in front of the window clear as day. I called my manager and told him that Im gonna need to head back into the bar with the cops he asked me why. Theres some asshole on the top floor who managed to give me the slip while I was locking up. He asks me Hes in the bay window facing the street right now? Yeah howd you know? Then he tells me. Dont worry about that just head home. Maybe I would have questioned him if I had any desire to reset the alarm and call the cops but I hung up and went home.,securityguards,dapb5pm,3,t5_2u042

If the guards didnt know this guy and he started walking towards the shooting victims room that is most likely what caused them to react.

11529379,0,t1_dg1xaho,At the risk of being labelled argumentative again...Since OC is an oil use of water with a surfectant like a baby shampoo helps to neutralize the covalent bonds and float  flush it off the affected surfaces. The inherent danger in air drying especially in chemical agent mixes such as OCCS is that eventually the body produces enough oil to create a barrier at the skin surface making the subject feel like its over. Later when they take a shower the water removes that barrier as it flushes the product off the skin leading to what many term reactivation. The fact is the agent was still active. You can wipe your finger on an exposed area and contaminate yourself. When I teach this we have buckets of water a garden hose and generic dollar store baby shampoo safe on sensitive tissues such as eyes and nose membranes available for contaminated subjects. We dont provide fans. This oftentimes leads to an effect similar to windburn or chapping. People sometimes opt to fan themselves but for reasons discussed earlier they basically are only removing the carrier product from the deployed agent. ,securityguards,dg2uv5x,0,t5_2u042
