1239344,0,t1_ci8wq60,Good explanation.  Just to add two quick things to this... Wingbacks wouldnt work well at the NFL because of two big reasons. They would be required to do a lot of blocking on DEOLB type players which would be a huge physical mismatch.. The types of plays that utilize wingbacks depend on deception from presnap motion and players with superior speed.  At the NFL the defenses are too intelligent and filled with physical phenoms for this to be a factor.,NFLNoobs,ci91jfn,3,t5_326ue

1251909,0,t3_28fho9,Theres a bunch of nicknames. I also know theres an ElephantJoker linebacker a CharleyJack I believe are both are the same and backers and those two I believe are all just hybrid positions Mo Mack Victor are all backers. Theres a F receiver in addition to X Y and Z which I believe is just a th receiver. But Im not sure on all of this stuff. ,NFLNoobs,ciage8t,4,t5_326ue

1423994,0,t3_2af1pt,theres a Redzone line sometimes.  That is when you are within twenty yards of scoring,NFLNoobs,ciurwyn,2,t5_326ue
2011270,0,t1_ckvjlc9,Yeah Ive noticed many teams line up two TEs instead of a fullback and if they want the FB in the formation a lot of times a TE motions back there.  Still there is an advantage to utilizing a true full back.  That sneaky handoff at the goalline ala John Kuhn is a great play.  I do miss watching Moose Johnston create holes.,NFLNoobs,ckvjzn8,1,t5_326ue
2017471,0,t3_2huj15,If the receiving team touches the ball it becomes a live ball so anyone can take it.  That is why if the receiving team doesnt catch the ball youll frequently see the returner waving his arms and shouting to his teammates to stay away from the ball.  The returner usually wont try to pick the ball up or catch it after it lands because of the risk of turning the ball over.,NFLNoobs,ckwavms,3,t5_326ue
2772346,0,t1_cnibvav,Reading your post Id guess that you probably have about the ideal bodytype and skills to play LB. To put it simply linebackers job is to cause chaos for the offense. They need to be good at pretty much everything but not necessarily amazing at anything. Linebackers need a good combination of strength speed size and intelligence. Duties especially at the lower levels focus on stopping the run. Youll also be responsible for helping cover eligible receivers mostly on short routes. Linebackers that show aptitude for it will also be asked to rush the passer.It sounds to me like LB is probably the spot for you based off what Ive read though of course I cant say for sure. Id try it out see how it feels. ,NFLNoobs,cnj7ey6,1,t5_326ue
2797772,0,t1_cnm2uwg,Then the kicking team would get a first down. A double change of possession meaning the defense gains control of the ball and then they on the same play give the ball back to the offense will give the offense a new set of downs.,NFLNoobs,cnm3hel,2,t5_326ue

5130281,0,t3_3l8muv,learning the players probably isnt that important to a new fan just learn the main players on the team you follow and you will learn about other players watching the pregame shows and during halftime when they show highlights from other games and talk about the big players from other teams.   getting to know the rules and such you could learn by playing the video games or just learn over time watching the games.  ,NFLNoobs,cv4e35x,5,t5_326ue
5950853,0,t1_cxzo58o,Interesting. Well maybe im wrong when the offense  fumbling team recovers... I was thinking about when the ball ends up with the defense. I just know Ive seen my receivers when catching and then fumbling get credited for the yards they caught and then lose points for the subsequent fumble. But I guess maybe when the offense recovers the ball its counted as one big play?  damn thats a good question  ill try to do some searching cause now im really curious. ,NFLNoobs,cxzoqgp,1,t5_326ue
6902179,0,t1_d0yls1e,Im an Eagles fan so the most recent example I can think of is Vinny Curry. He typically played less than  of the snaps but tied for the most sacks on the team in . He was used purely as a pass rushing specialist and was usually only on the field during obvious passing downs otherwise he was replaced by Cedric Thornton who was more of a run stuffer.,NFLNoobs,d0yoijd,2,t5_326ue
