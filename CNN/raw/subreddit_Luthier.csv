195154,0,t1_cf0njz6,I didnt angle the neck I SHOULD have.  It is very easy to do IF you have good tools.  Simply do the math find your required pitchangle . degrees is good usually.  Draw it on rough cut with bandsaw put our planer on a low low setting shave it down until its perfectly smooth.  My bandsaw was crap it couldnt cut through that thick of material  and maintain a  degree angle so it wouldve likely screwed up my guitar.  Sustain wont be killed by glue pockets that is logically ridiculous.  If you are good with your tools you wont have any problem making a solid connection.

264714,0,t3_1x4qoc,About a month ago we had a sort of post like this where a guy was complaining that the sub should be called Electric Guitar Premade Assembly.  Same sort of deal never contributes just makes a complaint thread.  Depending who you ask a Luthier is someone who builds string instruments or repairs them.  We arent all Paul Reed Smith.  Im sure theres all different professionals on here like someone who just got their Luthiery Certificate or someone whos been running a repair shop for  years.   The difference in degrees of experience is why verification makes no sense.  Earn your reputation dont sign up for one.

463735,0,t3_1zcqlm,With a crack like this I remove the strings and probably the nut to see if theres access to cracking under there pour a bit of Elmers Carpenter glue or Titebond etc. on the crack carefully flex the crack open and use a  gauge string to work as much glue down into the cracks as I can. Wipe off the excess glue and then clamp. Let it dry for  hrs. then remove clamp and clean up. Im sure there are other repair methods but this is a simple approach that works for me with this type of damage. The string tension works in your favor. Finishing and hiding the repair is a whole nother thing.Ive learned the hard way not to overclamp or apply too much clamp tension. Its possible to introduce some twist to the neckheadstock by being too aggressive with clamp pressure. Firm snug pressure that squeezes out a bit of glue is all thats needed. Ill bet you can repair it yourself!,Luthier,cfsz80n,1,t5_2rxqu

1526025,0,t3_2bnizf,I started doing minor repairs on my own instruments when I was about . Pickup swaps rewires setups strap pins headstock cracks all the easy stuff you can sort of figure out. At  I decided I wanted to do more and went to Robertovenn. RV is a great school that taught me a lot but people tend to have the wrong idea about it. You will get out of it what you put into it. If you show up and do the required work everyday you are missing out on a lot of info. I did me best to fully immerse myself everyday. Constantly asking about things that werent in the actual curriculum reading any books I could get my hands on and just having as many conversations about the business as I could with anyone qualified. RV focuses on building they pump you full of information that you dont realize has anything to do with repair until you start trying to repair.   After graduation I got an apprenticeship with a third party company that was inside of a guitar center. It was an awesome deal because I got paid what you should be getting paid between  per hour for quality repair work. After a while my boss put me in charge of thy location and wet to open another shop elsewhere in our area and I had increased my business by doing a pickupdrop off thing with a shop about  minutes from my city. At that point the evil masterminds of guitar center decided they werent getting enough of my money and started taking  of my money as rent. This went on for about two years until they realized they were still missing out on thousands of dollars a month. They then decided I would HAVE to be a company employee or leave the store. I said no to put it lightly. Actually its a better story just to say I told the district manager that  per hou was an insult and you can go fuck yourself. So I left to strike it out on my own. I still had the pickupdrop off deal going for me but they are a small shop in a small town and dont have much business. I tried to go on my own for a while and.......paid the bills but just barely. I had gone from nearly  per month to about  per month. After about six months I caved. I got a call from GC begging me to come work for them and I was desperate so I negotiated . per hour. This was a VERY VERY BAD IDEA. Everything about that company is terrible. So I did what any person with morals would do........and I sat back hardly worked and collected a check for a year and a half before they caught on. This time when I left I told te new district manager that this is great. I have never hated a job so much in my life. I couldnt be happier to leave.    This is where things got good. I had some money saved up so I found a cheap central location and opened my own shop. I was right near downtown lots of parking lots of neat local shops nearby lots of music venues nearby and a Wallgreens drugstore across the street that will become relevant in a second. There is nothing better. I was teaching mandolin lessons I had other instructors teaching guitar and banjo I did a little bit of building on the side I wasnt Rollin in money but I felt so good. Nothing like being your own boss. Fast foreword one yearCvs drugstore is on a national campaign to put Wallgreens drugstore out of business they are IDENTICAL and purchases my building uproots a dozen local businesses an demolishes the place. So I am back where I was before then. I work out of my house and sce up money to reopen my shop. I have a good reputation so people seek me out but its hard to not have your own place once you have had it. I should be reopnening soon.Now theres something else I would like to say. My class at RV HAD ABOUT  graduates. As far as I know here is who still works with guitars guy works at Santa Cruz.  guys at Collings.  guy at Parker.  guy at Rick Turner guitars.  girl who works for a private builder. There are probably about a dozen of us who do repair but that number seems to get smaller as years go on. Its a tough business to be in because every year RV has up to  graduates gallop has quite a few then there are the smaller schools now lots of colleges are having luthiery courses plus the internet shows you how to do what you want. It gets harder every year and your reputation is the only thing tht can really help you. My old boss was an amazing repair guy but a ton of his long time customers left him for me simply because he is kind of a grumpy guy and I have a sunny disposition.  I wish you the best of luck!,Luthier,cj7kbvy,3,t5_2rxqu

1556873,0,t3_2c2ujk,I a rank amateur luthier tried winding pickups with a handheld drill a few years ago.  It was a fun experiment that ended poorly.  The wire snapped frequently I had to estimate my turns and it was more difficult than I expected to strip the ends of the coated wiring.  Also I built the bobbin out of wood. It worked but was much harder than expected.If I ever do this again I will spend some time and care building a jig that will put the wire on consistently and count turns.  I would also make a bobbin jig.TLDR  No.  not practical.,Luthier,cjbfeeq,1,t5_2rxqu
1630640,0,t1_cjkpcb5,True. Other neckthrough designs I have seen have shown that you can access the nut through a pickup cavity. Doesnt seem too hard.

1641984,0,t3_2d3rip,They have an effect but the majority of volume and brightness in a classical comes from the top construction nuts and saddles are minor adjustments compared to that.I cant say what material will sound best on your guitar it depends on the individual guitar and what sound you want the harder materials are generaly a bit brighter though.Ebony is a fine nut material and if you have some you can make a nut and see how you like it. The few blind tests I have seen does not seem to indicate that people prefer one particular material on all guitars on some guitars bone is the best on others plastic sounds better I think plastic works if you have a guitar that is too bright as it can dampen the highs a bit.,Luthier,cjm4xhj,2,t5_2rxqu

1702010,0,t3_2dw5xv,gt. Id like to replace the stock bridge and I dont use tremolo. Is this the kind of bridge I want to be using? Does this still need to be blocked professionally?Your link didnt work but if its a Gotoh GTC that bridge is really for an unrouted body.As ALR pointed out you can block the original tremolo pretty easily yourself.  If you want it more professional use a wedge of some hardwood instead of the stack of coins.The added mass of the tremolo block has an effect on the tone which is why Eric Clapton went that route.gt. I want to change out the pick ups as well as doing the bridgemid pickup with the same tuning pot mod. Can this be done fairly easily?Yes so long as you know how to solder without burning up a pot or making cold solder joints.As ALR said you might want to invest in a new replacement pickguard to make swapping easier but it isnt necessary. Pulling the pickups and replacing them couldnt be an easier job than on a Strat.gt. I dislike the color of my strat and would like to refinish it. Is this actually possible on these models or is the factory paint on there cured too well? I really want to do just a natural wood finish maybe maple or walnut.Im not sure what you mean by cured too well.  Modern factory built guitars tend to come standard with a polyurethane finish to protect the body and paint from gouging chipping and fading.Can it be removed?  Yes.  All you need is a decent random orbital sander sandpaper and time.You will want to put an oil finish on it at the very least when you are done to keep the body sound.gt. Is there any way to get a neck for a strat that has  frets without messing up the guitar as a whole? Warmoth makes direct replacement fret necks that will fit any standard Fender Strat . bodyneck pocket.You will have to moveremove the neck pickup however as it interferes with the extended fretboard.Good luck.,Luthier,cjtp8p9,3,t5_2rxqu

1881973,0,t1_ckfxu9q,I think I shouldnt have used them. The first time I tried them was right there during that postconstruction test play. I had never heard those strings before and they sounded flippin stellar with the V in the bridge at that time. When I broke her back down to apply TruOil the strings had had enough of the way the locking tuners kink them. Locking tuners are great but once you have strings on you better keep them on.Long story short I got to try the Cobalts on a guitar I had never heard before and it was a face melter. Im hoping some of that juju was due to the guitar Ive got normal Skinny Top Heavy Bottom Slinky on there now. My preferred gauge for standard tuning.,Luthier,ckfyy4a,2,t5_2rxqu

It does also give the advantage of the hum cancelling effect  which is nice..As always the pickups you use will affect the sound you have when they are paired.

2491772,0,t1_cmjm61i,Its all pretty good but not really good.Thats probably about how I feel about them too. The hardware isnt bad but its nothing to write home about. The Wilkinson stuff they carry is a little better but its still the lowerend Wilkinson hardware Wilkinson licenses his designs to several manufacturers some high quality like Gotoh and some lowerend like Jin Ho and Sung Il. GuitarFetish certainly doesnt carry the better Gotohmade Wilki hardware though. Still Id take the Wilkinson parts over the GFSbranded ones.Ive seen GFS bodies and necks but have heard too many horror stories to want to risk money on them. There are plenty of threads on various guitar forums of people buying bodies with routes and screw holes in the wrong places warped necks that sort of thing. GFS is good at marketing speak and presentation but theres a reason those parts are so inexpensive. Theyre usable most of the time but they often require so much extra work that I dont really think its worth saving  over a MightyMite bodyneck or spend a little more on a basic Warmoth neck or KnE body and getting much better quality. Personally Id even rather have an Allparts Bstock body over a GFS one any day of the week. Despite their low prices I actually dont think the GFS necks and bodies are a good idea for a beginner because theres often more work involved to get them playable than someone might be able to do. If theyve got misaligned mounting holes it could lead to disappointment.The one bright spot I think are the GFS pickups. They tend to sound pretty good and are made well...then again theyre made by Artec who manufacture a lot of the OEM pickups for guitars like Squier at least some of the Duncan Design pickups ToneRider pickups and a bunch more. They seem to put a lot more thought and quality control into the pickups than their necks and bodies. I think theyre a pretty good deal overall as long as you know what kind of sound youre after because......GuitarFetish has something of a reputation for less than stellar customer service. They can be a pain to try and returnexchange stuff with so it helps if youre already sure of what youre getting and its another reason I wont order necks from them. Dont get me wrong they will do returnsexchanges but its usually not a pleasant experience and they seem to have a bad habit of making it seem like theyre doing you a favor.When it comes to hardware there are better deals to be had IMHO. If you spend a little extra time searching the web you can often find higherquality parts for not much more than GFS charges for their own stuff in many cases. A set of basic sealed Gotoh tuners made in Japan can be found for around  but will work so much smoother than the GFS ones and will last a lifetime. Even a set of Hipshot locking tuners can easily be found for  and those are fantastic full disclosure theyve recently become my alltime favorite locking tuners so Im a little biased  . You can even buy the Fender Standard MIM bridges directly from Fender for around  now and even though theyre not high end at least youll have a better customer service experience if you need it.,Luthier,cmjt9eu,4,t5_2rxqu

2822897,0,t3_2sfdb9,My guitar bridge is a Floyd Rose so Im quite used to play with the springs.

3143685,0,t3_2w55kl,A few guys on the reranch forum seem to like the seller mydzyefxy on eBay. Seems like the kit needed little to no work to get a finished product big problem for some. His LP kits seem to range from  to  bucks. the only problem if you care is the kits that have a figured maple top seem to be a pine top with maple veneer where as the solid maple tops are real maple. So something to think about if the wood used matters to you.

And please dont apologize for asking that! Completely reasonable question. Ive been playing for about  years now so Im fairly sure Im doing it right at least I hope lol. I always double check with a quick youtube video when ever I do something I havent done in a year or so. Thats what I did this time. Having the fundamental note played open low E and tuned perfectly and having the harmonic perfectly tuned at the th fret... I played the th fret fretted and it was sharp. So I naturally kept bringing the saddles back away from the neck. I worked slowly and eventually I ended up with what you saw in my first set of pictures. Im used to my strings starting at  and ending on  on my Ibanez. However I used normal  strings on the Fender. Would using lighter s cause this? Can lighter strings cause a difference in intonation?

3729228,0,t1_cqh10zb,gt Sometimes you can take the nut off and stack washers if the nut is bottoming.Not if its a doubleaction rod in which case the nut is welded to the rod. Im not sure if OPs particular guitar has a single or doubleaction rod but Fender should be able to tell him if he sends them an email. Im almost positive it has a doubleaction BiFlex rod but Fender changes their specs all the time so hed be best off asking them directly.To OP It seems like the guitar is acting as it should. If it has a BiFlex doubleaction truss rod its common for them to have a slight bow in their center position meaning where the rod is neutral and not forcing a forward or backward bow. If the action is correct now Id leave it alone for at least a couple of weeks and see if anything changes. Keep in mind that dualaction truss rods feel a little different than oneway rods and they often dont require as many turns to get the same amount of adjustment in the neck. DONT FORCE THE ROD! If you break it your neck is hosed. Now that Ive scared you a little dont worry too much because it sounds like the rod may have just been in a pretty neutral position and you put some tension on it.,Luthier,cqhcuaw,1,t5_2rxqu

4436430,0,t3_3bh792,If they dont buzz with that kind of gap they might buzz if you glue the ends down. The ends should have been glued down during a refret. Even if he is your friend thats not how you do a fret job on any guitar. On my guitars that I build I glue down all the fret ends that stick up like that. I take some medium or thin CA glue and put a drop in the fret slot in the end and clamp it down. I try and apply wax around the fret so the CA glue wont bind to the board. Otherwise youve got to clean a ton of glue off your fingerboard. Masking tape could work too.I use spring clamps for this kind of job. I put a flat board behind the neck so Ive got a flat surface to clamp to. The slot depth should be fine but definitely make sure theres room below the tang to press the fret down flat. The biggest issue I could see is that this should have been done before the frets were leveled and crowned. If you end up gluing the frets down and have height issues youre going to have to relevel and recrown the frets. Since theyve been leveled and dressed youre kind of doing a step back. ,Luthier,cspwbgx,2,t5_2rxqu

Just snip them next to the posts and leave the windings on.Close the gap by hand to check it actually closes and then work out a clamping system that will keep it firmly and evenly clamped. Do dry runs. Use cauls to spread the clamping pressure.Gluing is the easy part now. Apply a decent amount of glue you can add a little water to the titebond to get it to wick into the deep end of the crack not too much  maybe.Apply your clamps wipe off squeeze out with a damp cloth and let it sit.

5985586,0,t3_3xdc3k,I stopped using Bourns pots because I didnt like the way they feel and I kept breaking them during installation. Only pot brand Ive ever managed to do that with at least four separate times. The brassshafted Alphas that StewMac sells are some of my favorite and feel perfect after a week or so of normal use. CTS are kind of all over the place some feel great out of the box but the most recent ones I installed were really stiff far more than I like. However I did grab some of their new pushpull pots circuit board not the older ones with the lugs on the bottom and those feel great.If you want to make pots stiffer youre probably going to have to open them up and squidge some grease inside. Im not a big fan of opening pots unless its absolutely necessary but as uKendleC pointed out you can use whats called damping grease its specifically made for pots and faders and is what pot manufacturers use. DeoxIT FaderGrease should work well but you might also try a place like Antique Electronics Supply who sell parts and tools for restoring vintage radios and tube amps.

6182668,0,t3_408zsy,You might want to look into a gravity feed sprayer rather than a blowing over the top of a bottle model those tend to spit bubbles and globs.Im pretty confident that youll get better atomization of your finish with something like this assuming you have an air source that can do the right cfm. I usually spray lacquer thinned about  with acetone at about psi pressure at the gun. Great results.A similar gun is on sale for  this week without the regulator by the way.If youre comfortable with rattle cans a touchup gun will shoot a similar pattern and would be more inline with that experience. Unfortunately theyre more expensive than the full size models.Im not a Harbor Freight sales rep by the way I just couldnt find better pricing at any of the more common big box stores or on amazon. Ive used both models linked above though and they perform well and are easy adjust and maintain. I also have a number of CampbelHausefield and IngerasollRand guns mostly cheapies but they do a good job and last well. ,Luthier,cyselcv,3,t5_2rxqu

6960894,0,t3_4b0ke6,I live in an apartment and have sprayed here although NOT indoors! I learned that lesson once the hard way no matter how careful you think you are with covering things up youll get overspray on everything and youll keep finding it for months.Being an apartmentdweller and spraying from rattlecans isnt difficult it just requires a little more walking. Id spray three good coats per day and Id have to walk down a flight of stairs to do it. Not a big deal although I certainly wouldnt go that route if I had a bunch of bodies to finish. I set aside a place where I could hang the body to dry and the fumes wouldnt bother me lacquer stinks whether its nitro or acrylic but its not bad after an hour or so.Theres a slightly higher risk of getting dustdebrissuicidal insects stuck to the paint if youre going in and out of the apartment but I really didnt have any issues that I couldnt easily scuff off between coats with green Scotchbrite. Unless you drop the body in the dirt or something you can still get a glassy prolooking finish without a hermetically sealed spray booth. If you go with lacquer and Id highly recommend against catalyzed k paint for your first go at refinishing its very forgiving and easy to work with. Seriously lacquer is supereasy to work with.You can brush on a solid color but thats going to be a lot of work and will end up costing much more in both money and time. You have to build up much more paint to be able to levelsand it so youll end up wasting a lot more. It shouldnt take more than a couplefew days to spray all your coats of paint but brushing it on is going to drag that out because youll need to keep levelsanding the whole thing if you want it to dry anytime in the next six months. Brushing a lacquer finish onto a guitar is something few people would ever attempt more than once if they even attempt it at all.Heres what I would suggest having stripped factory poly k catalyzed finishes to bare wood dont. Dont strip the old finish back to bare wood because its a massive asspain no matter how you attack it. Instead you can scuff or levelsand the current factory finish to flatten it out and itll give you a nice surface for new paint. Itll act as a sealer and filler so you can just spray a couple coats of primer and go right to your color coats. Since youre doing a solid color you can skip the final clear coats if you want but youll need to build up a few more color coats so it can be wet sanded and buffed later. You can buff out solid colors directly but dont do it with pearls metallics or flakes because itll wreck the way theyre supposed to look those need clearcoats. If your current guitar already has a lacquer finish you can even skip the primer and start spraying a new color directly over it because lacquer melts previous coats and basically forms one solid layer as it dries note just in the interest of avoiding future issues Id probably still spray a couple coats of primer over the old lacquer but strictly speaking you dont have to.The thing with most modern factory finishes is that theyre a catalyzed part polyurethane or polyester paint. They undergo a chemical change as they cure and theyre ridiculously tough as far as paint goes. Ive tried one of the nastiest chemical strippers you can get Aircraft Remover and it doesnt really do anything to it even after several applications left overnight each time. A heat gun is the easiest method but its still a lot of work and theres always the potential for scorching the underlying wood or weakening glue joints its usually the best way to go but its still timeconsuming and you need to be very careful about not overheating any one area too much. You can sand it off but dont even think about doing it by hand and dont do that indoors either So. Much. Dust! Its hard to impress just how strong poly finishes are if youve never tried to strip it off before.TLDR brushing on a solid color lacquer paintjob is a lot of work its way more involved than spraying and often doesnt end up looking very good after all that work. Being an apartment dweller and spraying outside really isnt that bad and as long as the weather is nice theres no reason to avoid it unless perhaps you live on like the th floor and have to go all the way downstairs to spray.,Luthier,d15cpgt,7,t5_2rxqu

You may want to apply some when you are buttoning this project back up though.  if its like outdoor wood stain it may have protective properties. If its just dye you should have some form of topcoat. a can of Tung Oil or a bottle of Truoil can be rubbed on to build up several coats or you can spray a urethane and scuff that to a satin with steel wool when its cured.

Better quality control and I can have the same configuration Ive got here with the added option of a chambered body.I was looking at ash finishing techniques and found a really interesting option with white pickling gel stain Old Masters brand seems to be the choice. Darker base stain first using green on my next one seal it with something like Zinnser Bullseye clear shellac then use the white pickling gel and wipescrape it back. Ive seen a few done in deep blue and purple like that and it really looks great under a good clear coat.Mayones Guitars does some amazing finishes with ash that take advantage of the heavy grains appearance and texture. It looks like theyre doing media blasting or some other kind of scouring technique to remove the soft grain and make the hard grain into more pronounced ridges then doing a similar technique with dark stain first seal then color to accent the grain.,Luthier,d2773x4,1,t5_2rxqu

But in the end you didnt answer my question. You essentially told me not to try. I asked Where should I start the process of elimination for fret buzz? and your response was Dont. That doesnt help me. I walk away no closer to my goal. Im gonna get this guitar set up and Im going to do it myself. Thats why I bought the guitar in the first place The sole reason I acquired it is so that I could take it apart redo the finish dress and crown the frets wire new pickups put it back together and set it up. I bought it for learning. I already have several guitars. This one and one other are my learning guitars. And to be honest I know enough to know that this specific part of the process is not rocket science. Yes theres skill involved and there are definitely points beyond which you need a veteran but a quarter turn truss rod adjustment is not like diffusing a bomb.So I guess what Im saying  respectfully  is this Im going to fix this problem anyhow even though you told me not to. Because thats why I bought the guitar and theres no reason why I shouldnt.

Just be sure to practice the repair a few times get a nice clamping system down and you should be good. ,Luthier,d9p2jzk,2,t5_2rxqu

9883427,0,t3_5gv3kf,One instrument at a time one customer at a time and a good bit of luck. A day job or some kind of income stream apart from building is usually a must. Solid repair experience goes a long way towards a good reputation and I would argue that its pretty much a prerequisite to a professional building career. The vast majority of builders fail. Musicians even pros generally dont have the money to pay for hand built instruments and most hand built instruments arent any better than factory made instruments and in a lot of ways are usually inferior. And artists and craftsmen are usually terrible business people. And really just buy a Gibson or a Fender is pretty tough to argue against. I have several from both brands and they are very very good guitars. And then there are Martins and Guilds and Rickenbachers and Collings and Gretches and Paul Reed Smiths and ...,Luthier,davu1og,1,t5_2rxqu

10069221,0,t3_5jvemf,Hi!Crimson Guitars has some excellent videos on the subject and the website frets.com is a brilliant resource too covering all sorts of repair work mostly on acoustic instruments with pictures it also has some articles on fretting and nutmaking but the whole site is worth a read as many of the same principles apply to building a guitar in the first place....In a nutshell The neck is usually angled back slightly relative to the plane of the guitar top by careful fitting of the neck joint. The frets are installed into the fret slots in the fingerboard typically with a small hammer. They are then leveled to take out any high spots which leaves a slightly flat surface on the top of the frets. The frets need to then be crowned to restore the curved tops and dressed along the edges of the fingerboard to remove any sharp bits and make everything nice and comfortable to play. Finally the frets are polished to remove any scratches or file marks and make them nice and shiny!Take things step by step in a logical order read as much as possible around the subject and watch some videos Im sure youll soon get to grips with it! Having the right tools for the job really helps too  proper nut slotting files leveling beam etcHope that helps gtgtWoody,Luthier,dbk1j2y,3,t5_2rxqu

The shadow tells me there is significant drop off of the fretboard tongue where it is glued to the body typical and the frets go out of focus about fret  or  the area where the truss rod begins to exert the most influence.

They can differ in quality a lot but a very good quality one can be had for  and some slightly lower quality for  under They can come with traditional pickups single coil or humbuckers or even piezo pickups if you prefer a more acoustic  electric.

10862607,0,t1_ddzrdlf,Hey thanks for replying! I decided to just chisel away the rest of the guitar and build the existing block into my bracing. I found a box that looks nice and is big enough last time I went to the cigar store but at  a box Ill go see if theres something else first. I see potential for a headache with the square neck block on the angled box. It also isnt very deep but the pickup under the original guitar bridge still works so Im not too beat up about it.In any case Id be happy to post some pictures in this thread tomorrow and a new post with the final product and maybe some build pictures.,Luthier,de0eghv,1,t5_2rxqu
