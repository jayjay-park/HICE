6170999,0,t3_3zyw1p,The well known places that tend to get alright allocations in no particular order with my comments in parenthesis   Midtown Alright enough Im never that direction so I dont stop in often. When I moved to Nashville about  years ago they had some alright bottles from time to time. Frugal McDougals Same as above Craft Brewed Great spot good bottles but everyone goes here so things go ultra fast. Red Dog Another good spot with a good selection seems to get a similar amount as Craft Brewed but not as popular and out in Franklin so things seem to stay around longer IMO Reds Things tend to stay on the shelf because they are regularly  more expensive than anywhere else in town but if you are desperate...  I think they had KBS on the shelf for like  weeks. Cool Springs Wine amp Spirits Not bad but they never seem to get many bottles maybe they just dont know me well enough.,NashvilleBeer,cyr2ub2,1,t5_37i42

What kind of place are you thinking? Taproom with snacks? Strictly taps and bottles? ,NashvilleBeer,cz7ynvg,2,t5_37i42
6592756,0,t3_45xxad,Just swing by Demonbreun and th you can check out both Jackalope and Yazoo taproom and Frugal McDougals for anything else they might not have.  Craft Brewed as mentioned is another great bottle shop just a mile or two down the road.,NashvilleBeer,d018u20,3,t5_37i42
