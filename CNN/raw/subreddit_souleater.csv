893211,0,t3_24cf57,Spoilers No he dies in a effort to save everyone. He over worked his soul when useing tsubaki while fighting mifune. Mifune had no choice but to also stab black star in the heart. However tsubaki was pregnant with who will later be called Grey star. He is raised by Excalibur because Medusa uses Tsubakis body to become an adult again  thats why medusa hair is black. That is what lead crona back to medusa also because maka lost all hope and crona thought it was hisher fault sence the battle could have been won if they got brew but crona put the snake in marie... the loss of black star also caused kid to become insane and kill his father and becomeing a new god of death who just wants to end all life...ON A SERIOUS NOTE YES WE SEE ALOT MORE OF BLACK STAR IN THE MANGA ,souleater,ch5t90y,2,t5_2t27x

9238688,0,t1_d8n1c3v,I never thought of Ragnaroks nature disappearing because hes slowly merging with Crona thats a cool idea. My theory was that Ragnaroks personality was never more than Cronas selfloathing and repressed desires given a physical form and as Crona fell apart as a person he ceased to exist.,souleater,d8n2kr2,1,t5_2t27x
