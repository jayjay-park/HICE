No responsibility or leadership stuff required which lets you get a better feel for our community and gameplay style.If you would be so kind as to have a peruse through this setup guide before Saturday thatd be fantastic. Well be absolutely willing to help you with anything in there including troubleshooting we just cant do it on Saturday. We want to play our game too after all not troubleshoot.I would also strongly encourage you to drop in our IRC channel and introduce yourself! Were very friendly and again will be more than happy to help with troubleshooting or answer any questions you might have. That IRC channel is also our primary method orders of magnitude more than our teamspeak of general community interactionchatterimpromptu game planning so it is general place to hang out both to get to know the community and to find out ifwhen impromptu games Arma and others are happening.Most of us idle in there whenever were at our desks youre certainly welcome and encouraged to do the same if you decide you like hanging out here. Oh also if this is your first time using ACE and ACRE  or indeed if those names mean very little to you  please say so in the IRC channel! We will be happy to find someone whose schedule matches yours to jump on the server with you and show you the basics of how those things work. Theyre really pretty simple once you have seen then a bit but as with troubleshooting we simply cannot be giving a tutorialfirst introduction to them during our Saturday game. Youd miss out on all the fun too if we had to do that. For your own benefit and enjoyment if you are rusty or entirely unfamiliar with them let us know so we can find someone to do this little refresherintroduction with you.,ClearBackblast,cu04rk9,7,t5_2vqyb

5259475,0,t1_cvfietr,gt Genuine question though regarding illumination flares as Ive never really used them in AAC. Do you have much control of where they ignite? It seemed like most of the illumination flares may have been shot straight up over our own position instead of trying to get the flare over where the enemy is at. Sure some of them were shot for the sake of signalling an attack or position but all of the ones shot for the sake of illumination during combat seemed to be directly overhead. Shouldnt the idea be to illuminate the enemy while attempting to minimize your own illumination?Theyve got a decent enough radius that I usually shot them about  degrees towards the enemy and they ended up lighting up near the top of the arc. Once or twice I shot them over the enemy about  degrees but even then theyve got a pretty large sight radius that it didnt seem to matter too much.,ClearBackblast,cvjyfju,1,t5_2vqyb

5613367,0,t3_3ry22h,MoldyTowel  Boris SLThe Mission Maker  QuexFirst of all I love anything with old soviet era tanks and the Takistani Army faction so it had me in that aspect from the git go. The choice of map was a new one definitely a fan of Reshmaan Province. The mission itself was straightforward and in my opinion well executed. Seize the Power Plant. Up until the counterattack it never felt like we were safe and were under harassing fire the entire time. It was very cool and frustrating. I liked it a lot. Well done. More Combined Arms oriented missions! I do want to talk about the counterattack though after a couple minutes and bathtub smile killing the armor it was sort of thwarted. Boris got very stagnant and really had no mission at that point. Maybe the enemies could have came from multiple directions? Or in waves? Just spit balling im not too sure how I would have done that. Overall it was a great mission!Command  FletcherYou did a really good job here. You should take command slots more often. You balanced well between managing squads and letting them make decisions for themselves. Your command voice was good unlike my mumbo jumbo scatterbrained self impromptu squad leading sessions just be like that sometimes!. BorisWell done by all. Apologies for the extremely unorganized and piss poor start quite frankly my bad. Wasnt prepared to SL and yeah it showed. Nothing further to say here really.BathtubBad ass dudes! When we executed the iron curtain all the way to the Power Plant was probably one of my favorite things ever and in ArmA fashion only  guys were turned to tread grease in the process. This tactic actually worked which was super cool.,ClearBackblast,cwsw51z,8,t5_2vqyb

6107971,0,t3_3z7lwr,Ghazni  Designated Rifleman On the whole his was a pretty entertaining mission. The whole beginning sequence with the explosions was really nicely done and I felt appropriately disoriented although disorientation describes my goto state of being in most missions. Beyond that it was pretty straightforward with me doing what designated marksmen are wont to do and plinking away alongside my squad from cover. A highlight was when my fireteam moved out of the FOB towards the other compound and sat in the rubble as sporadic artillery rained around us and ignored orders to retreat blared over our radios. If I were to do the whole thing over Id probably drop the Apache having a hovering death machine shitting all over our enemies made the whole thing feel a smidge easy.,ClearBackblast,cyjwwqv,3,t5_2vqyb

6790670,0,t1_d0gdute,So in the case of the smoke what went on is that we were in a firefight nearish to the drop location and needed to drop smoke for concealment from fire while some guys got patched up. I cant remember if I threw it or it was someone in my fireteam but either way we figured white smoke would be fine since we figured a colored smoke was being used for helicopter marking. We figured wrong  Lesson learned it needs to be communicated what color smoke is being used for signaling and it probably shouldnt be white or black smoke if at all possible.

8454510,0,t1_d5y0ax9,I suspect the flaps do make some small difference just not enough to significantly affect takeoff profile. If it were a smaller faster plane they might have made more of a difference immediately after wheelsup but the C is such a boat that it honestly cant rotate fast enough for that. Angle of attack doesnt get steep enough for flaps to make a difference on stall angle for several seconds and I was a fireball well before that point. Funnily enough in the tests I did the flapsdown takeoffs actually ended up being higheracceleration than flaps up. Thats probably just random variations the runway was pretty bumpy for instance which could affect direction and speed but its indicative of how little of a difference flaps make. For that airframe at least. Im thinking I may do some more testing under more controlled circumstances with a few more planes and see what happens.,ClearBackblast,d5ycks8,3,t5_2vqyb
