1487233,0,t3_2b6ikm,I think My Neighbor Totoro is one of the greatest films of all time and perhaps the greatest animated film of all time. It is an animated film that says things that only an animated film can say. It expresses emotions that tell a story with images that feel familiar and warm while being completely unique. It is extremely human and extremely surreal. It is overwhelming and kind. It is sincere and whimsical. It expresses feelings that are distinct to childhood things most people forget. But it reminds us of them not through nostalgia or memory but by making us relive them in a story world that feels like how the world feels to a child. We experience the small moments again and our world is as big of the backyard yet the backyard is still filled with mystery and wonder. There is a sense of anxiety hanging in the air of this film but its foundation is warm and comfortable. It exudes love without romance. Anger without hatred. Fear without exploitation. It feels like childhood. Beyond that from a technical perspective Miyazaki is one of the greatest visual artists of our time. His ability to make character animation and images feel rich and honest while still remaining simple and efficient is largely unmatched. I think My Neighbor Totoro is one of the great works of film. It achieves so many things without imposing those as goals onto the audience. Its a movie that you live within as it plays. Its an experience that you try to hold onto as you leave the theater but you can feel it slip away with every step in the real world. Its dreamlike in so many ways and while its not without fault I think its wonderful and Id be skeptical of someone who had major issue with it.,12hrJDConnor,cj2p70f,3,t5_32fwb
8857813,0,t1_d7934lw,Hey Patience sounds cool Connor Ill have to look into it. I think the jazz comparison you make is great. Both Peanuts and Jazz exist in a similar kind of place to me  both are intriguing american and old and I often feel like Im not quite understanding all of their subtleties Im too culturally removed to ever quite get it completely but theyre both things that I always return to with interest. Like you say I think Peanuts will definitely remain in the cultural consciousness even if only on the fringes.,12hrJDConnor,d7cl192,1,t5_32fwb
