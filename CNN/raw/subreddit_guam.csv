367705,0,t3_1ya6gl,I grew up and lived near DCBaltimore. Major light pollution.  My first night in Guam I remember looking at the stars and was amazed how many there were. I never have seen so many. I am used to seeing  if that due to the light pollution. In Guam there is no pollution to drown out the stars. ,guam,cfivm8x,1,t5_2qx3l

1287328,0,t3_28tvds,Ive done the whole loop youve mapped out on a cc. It took me two days but I also included stops for sightseeing. From our home base in Tamuning the bottom half of the island definitely needed a full day because the hills kept our speeds at mph and lower along most of the western coast.,guam,ciefvim,1,t5_2qx3l

4455895,0,t1_csck2gq,UPDATE I got in touch with GTA to ask them if I really have Fiber because the online map says that my neighborhood only has ADSL up to . She explained that I actually have VDSLbetween ADSL and Fiber and Im in line to get Fiber once its ready.  This might explain the upload speeds as well as the ping. The neighborhood across the street has Fiber up to  so Ill probably get Fiber soon.  So just make sure to check the map before you sign up.   ,guam,csscj5e,1,t5_2qx3l

5660718,0,t1_cwyrcka,Yeah man I was honestly only half joking. Its really not worth it though def would not recommend it lol. I had the same issue in HS no car and we lived in the jungle basically. Its tough but if you cant find anything then just study or do something good for your health. Hang tough!,guam,cwyrlqu,2,t5_2qx3l
5663482,0,t1_cwywe8l,you take a lot of shit out of context...  Guam was going to be either a territory of the US or a possession of China... or if you want to alter history Imperial Japan.Based on your attitude at least being part of the US territories gives you the right to bitch...  youd be fucked in China.Guam without outside support and logistics would be deserted.  It is so isolated there would be literally no interest if not for the strategic placement.  I get the sense that you would prefer shucking coconuts for a living and you could have that if you want.  At least until the Chinese arrive.So bitch away my islander friend.  I love Guam for what it is.  Tough spot being so strategic trying to keep the Chinese from claiming even MORE territory in their pursuit for local dominance.  Guam will ALWAYS be in this position as perhaps the most strategic place in the Pacific to keep China in check.  Unless you want to go Chinese then you are going to have to cope.As for PR... they want the best of both worlds...  sovereignty for themselves and st World protection and benefits.  When shit happens who comes to aid...?  China..?  Well they might for your island.You have the freedom to do and become anything you want right now... as did I.  I suggest that the difference you seek starts with you.  Find your opportunity before China finds you.,guam,cwz3yy0,2,t5_2qx3l

7155914,0,t3_4denfa,A referendum was already held on this exact issue back in the s. Guam with a higher Chamorro population voted to become a Commonwealth while a very small minority voted for total independence. The Commonwealth movement fell through because  legislators at the time were unwilling to coexist with the military bases. Realistically the federal government owning a third of the island isnt much different than in the mainland where  of the land is also controlled by the federal government. Plus Guams strategic importance makes that even more of a sticking point. I can see Guam becoming a Commonwealth once it can get past that issue. ,guam,d1rk2qu,4,t5_2qx3l

9999808,0,t3_5is9ab,New car Realize that auto dealers here have no competition. One Toyota dealer one Kia guy Honda etc. islands just too small for more. Being mentally prepared for that will help you deal with the pricing in your brain. Cost for autos here is dictated to local dealers by the big distributor system in the states or wherever its coming from. From there dealers tack on the shipping cost they say they do not profit from it. Then taxes and tariffs paper fees etc. its a clusterfhck of other stuff. So go online. Be sure to match the EXACT model wpand fearure to what they have locally. And price match them. Dealers here are in no way stupid. They know exactly what everyone is doing with pricing and what wed expect. So they try to hide a lot of the price jacking with a whole bunch of crap. But then they also understand that they cant just out and out rape you like a dealer in China would. So they try to give the semblance of a good deal. Pay a couple  more than states and thats what youd get. The way you make up for in sticker ask for tons of extras. Just go crazy. Say you want the high end floor mats really a whole bunch of oil changes better rims whatever. Just keep asking. Get the company umbrella and mug and pens. Ask for the sunshade. ,guam,dbb057z,6,t5_2qx3l

11747344,0,t1_dgrdw1a,While active sonar isnt always on  I didnt claim otherwise  the Navy didnt curb its use to for the reasons I mentioned.  They did it because they were sued and the courts got involved.  That was after they ignored the mountains of evidence and many requests to at the very least reduce their rampant destruction of various marine life.So while your statement is true further explanation of the current behavior and what brought it about actually bolsters the wideheld notion that the military couldnt care less about environmental studies and public input.,guam,dgrla8t,1,t5_2qx3l
