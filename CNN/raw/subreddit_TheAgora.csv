2293,0,t3_1u4z0e,Would you say being elitist and being selfrealized are the same thing? If so then being elitist is the core ethic of Transhumanism. The more people that are striving towards excellence the sooner we can evolve as a species technologically andor biologically. We will see less and less use for average minds when automated machines take over many jobs. For example what will selfdriving vehicles do the taxi chauffeur and semi truck delivery job markets? Education is bleeding into the internet good computers are becoming cheap internet connection will be available to all. Perhaps the Information Age is the threshold to the Elitist Age. So my thesis is that it is morally reprehensible for any sufficiently intelligent person not to be elite.,TheAgora,ceep6p9,1,t5_2s584

You know its wrong or even if you dont you just do not care. Being just is for the benefit of the group so without that inhibition there isnt a reason to be just but youll be alone.,TheAgora,coju99z,1,t5_2s584
