8918391,0,t1_d7ilg8a,I dont know if you got my most recent messages on twitter they kind of got scrambled up since they were  replies.I paid attention last time this happened and the event that lead to it happening was that trails stopped completing for about  seconds.   i.e. I was back in my land and yet the trail wasnt completing.   I actually had to spiral inward on myself and almost died.The trail eventually did complete but from that point the fill algorithm was broken.   The trail completion delay persisted but slowly caught up in that the next trail completion still had some delay but less and the amount of delay tapered down with each trail completion until it was nearly instant again.Is there some trail completion event queue that can get backed up?    If so that might be a clue as to what causes the fill algorithm to break.As well one of my neighbors seemed to have the fill problem at the same time as I did but the other one did not.  So I dont think its universal for a whole server but it does seem to affect multiple players at the same time to some extent.,splix,d7juz1h,1,t5_3fk1z

If I then close the browser tab with splix.io on while watching the Activity Monitor about GB of application memory is released.EDIT I switched the quality to low and the problem went away.,splix,d8uyi7e,2,t5_3fk1z

9712239,0,t3_5dvvk2,Happened to us too on teams but the one time we spawned on top of a team that was also being spawned and we had no trails. We could kill with impunity and only died when we hit the walls or paused and someone hit us. We felt guilty after  kills and killed ourselves. Fun glitch!,splix,daa8r7f,1,t5_3fk1z
