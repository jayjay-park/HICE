1944981,0,t1_ckn7lyz,Naw no kids yet but within the next  years for sure. My BF was born in Seattle but moved to SD at  months. I spent  years in my elementary to middle school years between Bothell and Mukilteo. Ive only been to Whidbey Island for girl scout camp before though. Kitsap isnt the El Cajon of Seattle is it? Please tell me its more rustic and less methy.,Kitsap,cknkkwy,2,t5_2saeq

4275785,0,t1_cs7l74y,On one hand  RVing is a huge thing in Washington which is somewhat unique though not terribly so.  On the other its an RV place that is all over the sound that is named for a Kitsap county town.  On the third hand and appropriate for this hand  its kooky.  Why not?  Especially if you pronounce it as one word...Like I do.You know like South of the Border in the South East of the states.,Kitsap,cs7ll2a,1,t5_2saeq
4834631,0,t3_3h0wxq,If you have the whole day you should drive right on through bainbridge island. Cross the bridge hang a right and go to Bella Luna Pizza in Suquamish. Its only  min from the ferry. Sit outside and enjoy the view. On a clear day not today you can see mt. Baker the cascades seattle and mt rainier. Sometimes you catch the moon rising too.  ,Kitsap,cu3xzz8,2,t5_2saeq

6649449,0,t1_d073tfb,Ive been to bremerton waterfront a lot recently not exactly right now as ive been abroad for a week and I saw a very clean downtown without any people. I saw this on a thursday afternoon a friday evening a saturday midday and so on. I didnt see any of the solicitingdrug dealing that people keep harping about. Its certainly not as bad as it is in Seattle. But I saw a lot of closed and empty businesses.Very few people go to waterfront bremerton and I dont think its because of some odd people you come across sometimes. Thats a worldwide city trait that doesnt take away from business success. Rather many locals cant afford it or are not interested in the stores there and why would Seattleties go to Bremerton if they can get the same storesatmosphere closer and better to where they are now. Whats needed is more Bremerton professionals either working in Seattle or better yet in downtown Bremerton itself.Bainbridge is able to do this very very well. Bremerton can do it even better.,Kitsap,d073zs5,1,t5_2saeq
7024329,0,t3_4bsw8y,TLDR I dont really know but suspect you wont be able to just cast a vote and leave.I did back in  in Poulsbo but it was poorly run amp I suspect that experience wont generalize to this time.  I reported to a local church basement I think? and we segregated into Clinton amp Obama groups talked amongst ourselves for a bit and then each chose delegates to go to the County caucus.  I want to say the whole thing took about an hour but Im not confident thats right.  The weird thing was that there was no dialogue between the groups at allI was expecting to trade arguments wthe Clinton supporters but nopenothing.  The lady running the thing later indicated that yeah thats not really how it should have gone down but at that point we had worked out who were going to be delegates amp were ready to be done.At any rategood on you for caucusing!  I hope you can stay as long as it takes to have your effect on the nomination.,Kitsap,d1ck62i,2,t5_2saeq

10966176,0,t3_5wl9aw,Asking around  is a good start. Talk to your network to see whats out there. That how I have found many of my jobs as a younger person.. Do you have work or volunteer experience? If so get a resume together and use that to apply to some retailers on line. Spell everything right! Proofread or have someone look it over.. Can you pass a drug screen? Consider applying for a helper position at the shipyard. It might take a while but its a good gig. If you cant pass a drug screen stop using drugs til you get a job.. Whats your transportation situation? Can you get to a job thats not close to home? . Would you be willing to commute to Seattle? ,Kitsap,deb30xv,3,t5_2saeq
