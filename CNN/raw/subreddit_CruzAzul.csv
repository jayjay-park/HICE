2790626,0,t3_2s1by7,Roque is fucking good It may be early to tell but I dont think weve had such a great presence in the area in the last  years.Only thing missing is a little bit of fitness in the second half a few players looked totally exhausted.Btw does anybody know where the hell is Formica?,CruzAzul,cnla8n9,3,t5_2y7k1
2985570,0,t3_2udgke,Im sick of Joao. He loses possession every time he touches the ball or sends in crosses to nowhere. Does anyone know why Lizarzo hasnt made his debut? ,CruzAzul,co7g9jm,1,t5_2y7k1
3116005,0,t3_2vu736,Like uVirgateFire said it might be the th goal. Unless he got hurt or mad about the second chance he had but Im sure it is the first one.,CruzAzul,cokz1wf,1,t5_2y7k1
3855705,0,t1_cqvrjtc,haha yeah at this point we have tried old DTs that gave us victories but couldnt do the same on a return trip. I rather have a new DT that has promise that they can do great with the team than old DTs again.,CruzAzul,cqvsb2o,2,t5_2y7k1
4147150,0,t1_crrys4t,The signing is a complete joke! Wtf were they thinking??,CruzAzul,crszoej,1,t5_2y7k1
4579326,0,t1_ct7nfk3,At this point alemao would of been better for one more season to see if he developed over roque who just stays injured while charging a big check.,CruzAzul,ct7tup1,1,t5_2y7k1
4774915,0,t1_ctwec0q,Those shirts are quite thinner and more expensive! than the ones they sell at the store though.,CruzAzul,ctwf5ii,3,t5_2y7k1
5609291,0,t3_3ryder,I dont even know what happened. This season was broken since the very start.Im not sure of what do I expect for Clausura three liguillas missed in a row is not us but Im afraid it could be the new us. We are turning in a joke of a team with an empty stadium a corrupted management an elder squad that plays like unexperienced boys and the worst of the team attitudes Ive ever seen in a team.Wake me up when the new tournament begins Ill be there at the stadium wearing my teams jersey and I really hope they want to be there too fighting for what it means to have the team crest on their chests which seems something theyve all forgotten.,CruzAzul,cwsdxww,3,t5_2y7k1
5765422,0,t1_cxbn3nc,Yeah he can definitely bounce back and if Mendoza keeps improving we would have a pretty nice  at RB,CruzAzul,cxbr58i,3,t5_2y7k1
6791574,0,t3_48pwcq,Didnt know he was in our academy. Great lets see if being Chacos son helps him into the team later on. We need more academy players come to the first team. ,CruzAzul,d0m43no,2,t5_2y7k1
9067874,0,t3_54h8r8,estoy orgulloso de cruz azul solo dejo tirar a tigres una sola vez en todo el partido si siempre jugaran as no se les reclamara nada,CruzAzul,d81t8c0,2,t5_2y7k1
