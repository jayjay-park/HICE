7176827,0,t3_4dsn25,Could we get a font size adjustment option on the iOS version? The default font scale is a bit larger than Alien Blues previous tiny option it massively reduces the information density perceived and otherwise on small iPhone SE displays. Id like to switch most of the new apps really quite nice but this feels really unwieldy to use. Feels like a real regression.Its not just the font scale that makes it feel less dense its the sheer amount of paddingwhitespace around the comments. It just doesnt feel like an app that was designed with  displays in mind and there are a lot of us out there. Contrast Alien Blue with the new app,redditmobile,d1txu8z,30,t5_2rmtr

Dont take me to the comments and make me have to press it again then have to swipe back  times once to get to the comments after viewing the post once more to get back to browsing the subredditIf I wanted to see the comments of the link post Id press comments!Also make an option to disable thumbnails whatever the big pictures that come up are on the non impact view because itll make me think theyre link posts ex I wrote a review on some pants in a self post and I linked an image I took of the pants IN the text post. On the app it shows the picture I took as a thumbnailish giant picture thing even though my post is a self post. Make it so when someone types rinsert subreddit it links to that subreddit idk if its already like that I havent checked yet.Anyways do these things and itll be the best app out thereAlso Id like it if we could swipe our finger from left to right while browsing a sub to open a sidebar that displays our subreddits like on the iAlien app yafeelme.Thanks.EDITSAlso press and hold while viewing a picture to save it to photo galleryAnotha one you literally have to open imgur within the app to view an entire link post. EX  on the app unless you open the post then press imgur while youre at the comments youll only see up to the  not the Greek letters   lt what you see on the app. then you have to press the imgur right next to the guys username to view the entire image. Link posts on the app are ass tbh fam. Just make it so all link posts have a thumbnail all text posts have no thumbnail at all.
