11464512,0,t1_dfvhccn,Thats a good question! I never really had any interaction with the prison staffs where these guys were housed but I would guess that the behavior continues in jail. This also explains how some sociopaths occasionally suck in female prison staff members into helping them escape etc. theyre usually really good at turning on the charm to manipulate people and when the right vulnerable person comes along... Sociopaths always think that theyre pretending really well and that no one will catch on but this thread proves that they are dead wrong about this. Almost everyone gets an uneasy feeling from sociopaths and pretty much everyone catches on at least eventually!P.s. Lol re gut feeling! ,My600lbLife,dfvhunz,3,t5_38ycw
