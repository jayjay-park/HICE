61341,0,t1_cekxa8r,Well the article is about the lessons Tiina Booth learned and did not learn while coaching high school so it makes sense for her to point out the things she has not yet figured out. She isnt saying that she is unwilling to learn the things in  just that she so far has been unable to and is glad that she has assistants who can teach these things. It also serves to illustrate a very good point that the vast majority of ultimate teams at every level have less coaching support and infrastructure than they should. Most teams dont have coaches let alone assistant coaches and some coaches are just alumni who still live in the area but otherwise arent especially qualified.As to number  I can only speculate that this issue with cross country runners as opposed to soccer basketball football and hockey players is that soccer basketball football and hockey are all team sports that rely on everyone working together and spacing appropriately on the field whereas cross country is not. Spacing and teamwork are HUGE and while a runner might be slightly fastermore conditioned than a soccer player they are usually much much worse at spacing. ,ultimate,celewqg,2,t5_2qnym

214346,0,t1_cf2uffi,Plyometrics are great but not for endurance. The thread title mentions sprints but the OP later said he wanted endurance... so... mixed signals.But on to your direct questiongtis it good to sprint after a long run to simulate a tournament scenario?You need to separate in your mind simulating a tournament with preparing for a tournament. For most cases training and preparing are different from performing the actual event. Marathon runners do not just run marathons. Football players do not just play football.  Theres a lot that goes in to preparing a training program but just going allout is generally considered not the best approach. You need to be challenged of course it should be difficult and stress your limits so youll grow but it should not be simulating exactly what youll do in a game. There are nutritional and physiological impacts that you can leverage to better prepare yourself. Use the bodys natural growth process to your advantage dont just tax it to the point of breaking and hope youre better after recovery.Edit I realize I went on a tangent and didnt directly address the example. Sprinting after a long run is not detrimental to your goal but not the optimal way to improve speed. Speed and short twitch muscles should be taxed to gain improvement. But if youre starting that after a  hour run youll just not be able to push the same as if youd first had a recovery period. Yes this is more like what youll do in a tournament but youre not in a tournament youre trying to prepare for one. Perform resistance exercises sprints weights plyometrics etc... when youre fresh enough to push yourself. That is how youll improve speed and strength. After a  mile run youre more likely to just go through the motions and realize much less gain from the exercise. Work smart rest your body replenish carbohydrates then do some sprints where youll be going near your top speed. Recovery time depends on your individual body some people could run  miles before breakfast then do sprints at lunch. Thats great... but I cant recover that quickly so I dont do that.,ultimate,cf2ux3u,4,t5_2qnym

543582,0,t1_cg1vccj,Clearing in that manner lets the defender poach the lane since for a few seconds at least the cutter is not a threat. Even just by starting the hard deep cut the cutter forces the defender to stay on him. Its not a low percentage throw if the defender doesnt stay with him. And if he gets help then someone else is open. If the defender does stay with his man then sure make a different cut. But at least youre engaging your defender rather than letting him get in the way of the next two under cuts. ,ultimate,cg228g6,1,t5_2qnym

As long as you arent clogging the offense you should be fine. The only word of caution I would have is that in some situations getting the disc worked to the breakside of the field may be more valuable than moving the disc upfield such as with a heavy crosswind and a hard downwind force where completing the swing all the way to the sideline turns every throw into a downwind throw.,ultimate,cg8knwk,15,t5_2qnym

914712,0,t1_ch85lms,The only way I know of to figure this out is to lay out for a bunch of discs that might be too far away and miss some of them. Then youll learn how far you can reach when you bid. An entertaining way to practice this is to get a running start and lay out for discs thrown over a swimming hole or if one is not available a slip and slide.For your original question position yourself the same way you normally would on defense. A layout is just a way to extend your regular reach. If youre covering an upline cut and the thrower throws the disc youre probably slightly behind and to one side of the cutter. Imagine a scenario where you are running shoulder to shoulder with him and can just reach out and catch the D. Now imagine youre slightly behind that position  if you lay out you can still catch the D!,ultimate,ch89bv3,3,t5_2qnym

All of the trips were all expense paid trips for the American players all over the country of Japan for two weeks at a time. Sometimes we taught in  degree weather. Sometimes we taught  players in a day. It was tougher than the American players thought it would be. They earned their free trip no doubt. We grew the sport in Japan to such a great level that the Japanese won three out of the four divisions at the World Championships in Perth Australia . I was proud enough for tears even though I am American.I went back to Japan for  for the Dream Cup tournament and received a standing ovation from  Japanese players at the event.

My wife Alison could not understand why we were treated as royalty and were not allowed to pay for a drink or dinner anywhere. I was both embarrassed and rocked to my soul. I knew they understood how much I had done and how much I cared about Japanese ultimate. We moved the sport in Japan at a high rate of speed to catch up to the United States. My feeling of major accomplishment there was for all of the Japanese players to get inspired by all of the incredible American talent we brought to Japan.,ultimate,chlkpl3,14,t5_2qnym

Have separate practices but at the same times so that the B team players can still see what they are working up to.  Absolutely make sure that the culture on the B team and the A team is the same.  If you have an identity as a goofy team whose main goal isnt to win nationals dont have your B team be all about winning.  Likewise if your A team is all about winning as I think it should be make sure your B team has the same mentality.

Its harder for defenders to gain distance from offenders so if youre playing good defense and keeping your feet under you you will be physically closer to your man and closer to the bid. More opportunities.. If you are on the fluffy stuff physical penalties for you and anyone around you are degrees safer when laying out.

Im also an Accounting major and will be working fulltime in a Public Accounting firm right outside the Big  think BDO GT McGladrey etc. I am quite certain that you can play Competitive Ultimate while working in Public Accounting. Most Club teams have their formal practices on weekends announced far in advance and may have individual workouts that are to be done on your own during the week. So pretty much what you need to do is budget an hour per day to do the workouts you probably only have to do  per week if that and make sure to keep tournament and practice weekends free again youll know about these weekends far in advance.

2494740,0,t3_2o6d8p,Interesting article and my general view is that the ultimate community is too small to divide against itself.  The recommendations at the end of the article make sense and the USAU should maybe loosen up a bit.Some comments thoughWhat does Brody have to do with anything?  The nature of internet fame makes it hard for me to believe that Brody is here to stay whatever that means.  He shows up in the beginning of the article then disappears.  Not sure what he has to do with the point of the article.On that note Im not sure the pro leagues are here to stay either.  Right now they seem like a labor of love.  As Skyd has pointed out that only gets you so far.More substantively though I still dont understand the problem.  Even the section of the article called The Problem isnt clear.  Snuffed out?  What?  Whats the problem again?Id argue that it doesnt matter if kids know who Brute Squad or Revolver are.  Those are club teams for the players.  Players founded the team to play the best ultimate possible.  They are not a performance or a spectacle.  The teams is about them the players.  It is about playing.  Doing.  Not watching.  Fame isnt the point.  Playing is the point.Let the pro leagues worry about the entertainment product.For the record though I dont think the ESPN broadcasts of the USAU games were unwatachable.  Unwatchable how exactly?  I liked them.  Yes it helps if you know something about ultimate.  Same with any sport.  Just because some guy doesnt exactly understand every little thing does not mean there is a problem.  I still dont get half the rules of pro football and I watch it every week.I dont really want my USAU dues going to make good players famous or getting people to come see big games.  I want my dues going to improve the experience of grassroots ultimate the games I play in.  All I care about is my experience as a player.  Im not hostile to fans just indifferent.  Club ultimate is a thing you DO not a thing you WATCH.More players than ever are showing up to play USAU college and club ultimate.  Thats what the USAU should care about.  The USAU should not care that spectators dont come to these tournaments.  The USAU is for players.  Those are your dues.  Lets not get confused.Kids who start playing ultimate will figure out who Revolver is pretty quick.,ultimate,cmk78ee,11,t5_2qnym

Do you think that taco bell subway McDonalds etc gives suggestions or do you think they tell them the quality and branding they expect?Youre twisting my words. Tell vs suggest etc you know what I mean. I am confident the AUDL has a series of expected guidelines for each team to follow and they present these guidelines to each team in a manner of telling and not just suggesting. These guys arent idiots most have business backgrounds and understand the level of oversight needed to produce a great product especially after the events of the  legal battles.McDonalds Taco Bell Subway etc are perceived the way they are because theyre BIG. Franchises still retain plenty of control but their individual failures and successes are lost in the mix. Because the pro ultimate leagues are smaller theres much more scrutiny. I think a better example is the NFL. Each team has its own set of owners and managers and while they are still regulated to some extent they have freedom to run events and shape their identity. As such with only  teams their highs and lows are documented more thoroughly much like the AUDL and MLU.gtI for a fact wouldnt want a game cancelled because my team couldnt afford to pay for travel.What are you referring to?

You arent going to lose Beau youre going to gain Claire Desmond.  You arent going to lose Alan Kolick you are going to gain Opi Payne.  There is a natural limit to the number of starsteam in singlegender Ultimate but in mixed you can have a diversified roster of stars that allows you to develop more. If you watched the world games it was clear that the women matchups present opportunities for developing stars. gt Honestly I cant see most of the elite players taking time away from their open teams to join a mixed pro league.Since its seems like your objection to following mixed and the new elite team identities is based in your belief that the best players wouldnt play mixed you should read my counter to that in the article.  Ive laid it out and there are sources.  Ive talked to players about this and I dont share your conclusion.gtIf less people are watching sponsors arent going to care if it promotes gender equity.First sponsors do care about values in addition to the number of people watching.  For example sponsors drop Tiger Woods when they perceive that his brand doesnt reflect well on their values.  They add playersteamssports whose brands align with their brands.  If you watched the super bowl a lot of brands are trying to align themselves with integrity and opportunities for women.  Second you keep going back to this not a lot of people will watch assumption which is unsupported.   people bought tickets to watch the World Games final.  When mixed is the main event and has the best players people will watch. Your previous assumption is based on your other unsupported assumption that the best players wont play. I challenge you to support those assumptions.gtbut the reality is that neither of them are going to budge and we need to stop trying to press them to.USAU will budge if the values are aligned andor the majority of the Ultimate communitytheir membership support the leagues. They cant credibly support a conflict with a proleague that advances everything USAU wants for the sport simply on the basis that USAU has no direct control.  gtI havent done a lot of research on this myself but heres a scholarly article that shows that men and women have different preferences in televised sports. And I dont think I need numbers to back it up but men are the primary watchers of televised sports. While I cant read the scholarly article due to access the abstract is really interesting.  I could put together a too long for this forum case that Ultimate with selfofficiating captures the best of both worlds in terms of the interaction of athletes and the form of the sport. And of course more men are the primary watchers of televised sports.  Who makes the programming decisions? Who are participating in the vast majority of televised sports? Who played sports growing up because it was expected so are more likely to appreciate watching it? The trends for these things are changing  .

3852860,0,t3_34cn7x,This and next year are Blackmans year. Im not in state anymore to follow it personally but its still lead that Blackman should take this year with a few close games then dominate next year. After that Independence should have built another powerhouse team. That rd and th year have potential to produce a decent USN team but its unlikely and after that USN will never again be a serious contender. I expect to see White Station rise to become a serious threat in a few years and maaaybe Knoxville will produce a good program soonish. McCallie I could see getting strong since the team as a whole has a decent understanding of the games principles but they never produce great individual players which will hold them back from the top stop until they fix that. Really the next decade or so should be a back and forth between Blackman and Independence since those are the only reliable programs currently set up but I think their example and presence in the community could help other schools develop comparable programs.Edit woops just noticed this was about the tournament not the scene as a whole. Blackman should take it Indy at second and I think maybe McCallie or White Station at third.,ultimate,cqvgm9x,1,t5_2qnym
3860504,0,t1_cqwbd6m,That doesnt make any sense.  If hes cutting in and youre in front of him and in position to make the D you WANT the thrower to throw it.  You want the D.  Its much easier to get a D in ultimate than a steal in basketball so you want to encourage risky throws by the offense.Youll be in even better position to defend if you run as fast as you can which involves using your arms to run and not to obstruct the cutter  UNLESS youre fouling the cutter by pushing on him or grabbing him with the arm.  Basically I think the OP is full of it and he fouled the guy but is trying to frame it like he didnt to get people to agree with him.  The OPs story doesnt make any sense.  Its either bad defense or a foul.  Cutters dont get pissed off in that situation unless the contact by his arm is a lot more than hes trying to say that it was.An alternate theory would be that the guy is just super sensitive and thinks any contact is a foul but that doesnt seem likely since he didnt call a foul.  He just told the OP after the point that his use of the arm was inappropriate.  I dont see any reason not to take his word for it.,ultimate,cqwbyqx,1,t5_2qnym

3863491,0,t3_34ome2,The relevant rule is XVI.H..c. There are two sections. When the disc is in the air a player may not move in a manner solely to prevent an opponent from taking an unoccupied path to the disc.... A player may not take a position that is unavoidable by a moving opponent when time distance and line of sight are considered...Neither says anything about offense or defense. In principle if one offensive player blocked a defender from making a play on the disc but wasnt himself trying to catch it it would be a blocking foul on the offense by part . Not sure how it would come up though.In any case this play was certainly not an offensive blocking foul under rule  because the offender was trying to make a play on the disc.It might be under rule  if the defender can argue that the contact was unavoidable. If he was already bidding towards the disc for example and the offender cut in front of him it would a foul on the offense. But if the offender changes direction to the disc the defender does not have a right to charge into the space its a foul unless the contact was unavoidable.The offense could try to argue that the initial contact was not a foul  both players try to go to the same space not necessarily a foul in accordance with XVI.H. but that the subsequent contact that knocked him over was a foul. Not sure how that would go over however.I dont think it particularly matters that the offensive player was ahead of the defender except as that applies to time distance and line of sight are in play. If the offensive player doesnt realize the defender is coming up behind him but the defender can see the offensive player clearly then the offensive player might be able to call a foul on the defender but not viceversa.,ultimate,cqwo827,5,t5_2qnym

If the cup plays loose Id put the poppers in the holes like Elias says. If they play tight and dont react to fakes or poppers because their positioning takes away those throws anyway move your poppers back and have them ready to anticipate and react to swings.Similar thoughts for your wings if the wing defenders stay out wide move the wings to the middle with one wing stretching the deep deep while the other has room for over the tops. If the cups playing tight it could be good to keep the wings wide and make the wing defender cover both the popper and wing.

4238968,0,t3_39eeha,I play in the DC area. Our summer leagues are of varying quality and size. For most of these Ill assume were in rec league beginners and people who want to teach beginners because that tends to be a popular league as well as the one with the most variance in skills. We also have intermediate and advanced leagues where a lot of these points may or may not apply e.g. truly terrible players etc. and Ill talk about those a little bit too if the answer depends on the league quality. Well also address these in terms of improving yourself. gt  The other team has a terrible player. Your team baits the throw to them then clamps down like crazy once they get the disc.Part of the game is exploiting matchups and making the other teams second or third or fourth choice beat you. Its certainly not nice to do this to beginners in summer league. Id say in a league where beginners exist you should at least start out playing honest and if they show themselves to be terrible you can say we should run on that guy or we can let that guy have the disc underneath. If youre assigned to guard that terrible player youd probably gain more from not letting him ever get the disc. I mean...if the rest of the team is playing good defense on better players why shouldnt you shut down this terrible player?gt  Same as above except theyre a great athlete and this is the best way to contain them.Perfectly fine strategy I think. The difference between this and  I think is that beginners are generally trying to learn the game and no one is really getting any benefit from making them throw a bunch of turns  theyre not getting any enjoyment out of it theyre not really getting any better and youre certainly not getting better by beating up on them. A great player firstly is harder to contain and secondly gets a lot more benefit from having a tough defense thrown on them. I think you get more benefit from being challenged than you do from being completely overpowered. In other words you gain more from losing  than you do .gt  The other team doesnt throw to their women so your ladies spend the game poaching.Totally fine. Thats the other teams problem. If they want to take advantage they should throw to the ladies and if they start doing so your team should adjust.gt  The person youre guarding has no idea where to go on the field so you poach deep all point.Your prerogative but know that youre not getting much better from doing this especially if they never really challenge you by sending the disc your way. Having this matchup allows you to do several things actually. You can poach a bit but choose your moments. If they actually make a legit cut stay in the lane for a second afterwards. You can also assume that they know what theyre doing and keep your mind in the game. Where would they like to go if they knew what they were doing? Stop that cut before it happens. Stay engaged on defense for the whole point. Sometimes youll have that favorable matchup and its good to keep yourself mentally ready for when you dont have it.gt You look off players who always turn it over because they are totally inexperienced.Bad. Dont get into the habit of looking off players. Youve been inexperienced at some point and Ive been inexperienced at some point. I was fortunate to have good teammates and coaches early on who gave me more chances and helped me when I made mistakes. At any rate it sort of sucks when you are just starting out do something right get open on a cut and then for no good reason the throw doesnt come or if you make a couple of mistakes the throws stop coming because your team no longer trusts you. You never want do I trust my receiver? to be part of your thought process when you make throws to open people especially on open underneath cuts. When you play on more competitive teams this will be less of an issue and you dont want to have the habit of looking off open throws.gt You look off players who always turn it over because they throw stall  hammers instead of dumps.Are they inexperienced? Then see above. If theyve been playing long enough to know better then by all means avoid throwing to them. Actually Ill amend that statement. Every game is a fresh start. If they do it once talk to them. If they do it twice Id stop throwing to them unless as a last resort.gt Youre trying to improve your physical defense so you match up with another club player however the player doesnt enjoy that style of play.I think that physical defense is fine in general and very few club players will object to it. If they start calling fouls tone it down but feel free to contest if you really disagree with a call. If you bump each other because you beat your man to a spot then that shouldnt be a foul but if youre using your hands pushing etc. then that is probably a foul. gt Youre trying to improve your deep throws so you look off open incuts in favor of  deep shots to your best receivers. Theyre working consistently but only a few people touch the disc.Improving your deep shots are not just about throwing it well. Theyre about throwing it at the right time. If youre holding the disc waiting for a deep look to open up then its probably not the right time. The best hucks tend to happen on stalls  and . In fact never look off an open under cut if youre waiting for a deep shot. If the cut hasnt happened yet and youve had time to think about throwing it deep and you havent sent it you probably wont get a better chance on that particular throw.gt Your working on throwing and going so you look off people who dont throw it back if you get open.Ehhh...I do the throwandgo thing a lot. Experienced players know how to do it. Many inexperienced players either arent quick enough to catch on dont see the benefit of giving the disc right back for little to no yardage gain and often a yardage loss or have that nasty habit of turning upfield as soon as they catch it. Heres the thing...if you dont get it back you still have something to work on because the throwandgo move doesnt always get open especially the second time you do it to someone. You didnt get the disc back for whatever reason. Set up your dump cut or continue your cut deep or something. Have a continuation move ready for the times you dont get it back right away. If your receiver is inexperienced show them the move explain why its beneficial using a reason other than Im a better thrower than you and then throw to them again next time.gt To get better at layout Ds you mark up on a slow and inexperienced player and bait the D.This one is a mixed bag. You should be marking up on someone who is at least comparable to you. If youre marking a slow player because youre either slow or because your six teammates all have decent matchups and you got left with the slow guy then have a ball. I dont know that youd be getting better by doing this though because getting a layout D is not just about baiting a throw. Theres an element to that but its about closing speed and anticipating your matchups cuts. Work on that more than just baiting. A lot of my layout Ds have been a little bit of baiting but mostly making a good educated guess on my opponents cut before they make it.gt Youll try to sub in whenever you can by quickly heading to the line after every point however youll step off if asked or enough other people assertively go on so if everyone did that thered be no problem but more passive players might not play as much.Dont be too proud to take a couple of points on the sideline. Everyone has paid to play in the league and should get a decent amount of playing time. If youre trying to sub on when youre not ready then youre doing yourself and your team a disservice.,ultimate,cs3fnd0,1,t5_2qnym

4313510,0,t1_csb598j,This is clearly not the discussion for you.I am definitely reaching in this conversation... but not really here where you mention it.What is the relevant underpinning of the rules which you are trying to bring to light?Im trying to grasp the minutiae of the travel rule because I believe it can be better written and that players tend to make assumptions about what the travel rules are and are not.  I want the language to be clean simple and concise.  I want players to be able to change direction after catching the disc but before coming to a stop because thats a totally reasonable thing to do and  of players do some version of it already! The ones who DONT are the ones who look out of place... just like the teammate who counts an actual second stall sticks out like a sore thumb..  I do not think that these goals are unreasonable and I do not think that the current edition of the rules is a perfect finished product.   In playing for nearly two decades on all variety of crap fields Ive never had occasion to place my pivot on a sprinkler a hazard disc or a garbage bag.  I have however caught the disc stopped with one foot in the air. I did so again recently and from there my brain started humming about the travel rules and the assumptions the rules make governing travels and other onfield actions.  So I came here to investigate the ultimate hive minds opinion on some of this before I dove back into my own thoughts.Im not looking to find a hole in which there is no rule against it and devise some masterplan of onefootstandingstill receivers.  Doesnt seem viable.  Im trying to understand what the understanding of the rules is when it comes to this specific area and others but not in this thread.Itd be different if I came in with some goofy idea like it doesnt say I cant throw toasters at my opponents during play right?

4496650,0,t1_csxc4ix,Thats a pretty narrowminded way of viewing this. Im not made of money and I can only budget a limited amount of charitable donations each year. I donated with the expectation theyd come to my home state as that impacts the people in my home state  it fuels the local economy supports the native teams increases the interest in ultimate and inspires young girls getting into sports. To have AllStar pull away from NC means my donation no longer supports the local interests. I wouldve happily donated my money to a local org like Take the Field or TYUL or YMCA instead.There was no inclination the cities would change. The asterisks said dates might change but nothing was said about cities changing.This would be like if you donated money to Habitat and Humanity who said they were planning to help disaster relief in your city then after your donation changed their mind and helped other people in other cities ignoring your city. I mean yay go Habitat but living on a limited paycheck its kind of frustrating to be misled by false info.

4992258,0,t3_3jar4q,Part of what makes ultimate appealing is that the culture is generally very accepting of everyone and each person is just as important as everyone else on the field in theory. There are no embarrassing lineups in the gym or on the field where teams are picked one by one until just a few remain and they feel inadequate and unimportant this feeling would be exacerbated if you were the absolute last one picked. Most pickup games I have been to either divvy up the teams by flipping the disc heads one team tails another or do it by what color tshirt you happen to be wearing at the moment when you show up or just kind of drift towards the endzones in roughly even numbers and start a game.edit wanted to add a little more about how I felt and some examplesIve never played another sport where BOTH the people and the game are inclusive and accepting of everybody.Have you ever seen some guys playing some basketball on the local court or at the Y and want to pickup with them? Nah man we already got even teams is what youll usually hear even if you tell them youd be cool with subbing in and out. Or see some people playing soccer in the field in the park and want to play with them? Sure theyll usually let you get on the field but youll never have the ball passed to you.

Do you do an equal amount of pressing and pulling movements?My upper body lifting isnt super intense. I dont do a ton of work with weights to be honest mostly just dumbell bench presses going for reps more than weight.

5426126,0,t3_3oo7qv,Im late to this thread and will preface this by saying I am nowhere near an amazing player. That said I really found layout drills to be helpful. Some teams are not fans of them so in this case find a friend to either toss or hold a disc  about waist height. Get a running start and just... dive for it. Figure out how far you can dive and put a coneline. Just repeat it  times and youll get used to the slight pain that comes from landing on the ground. For me once I realized I wouldnt break a bone every time I dove it was a lot easier to do. This doesnt work for everyone but its worth the  minutes to give it a try.One handedrim catches Find someone to toss with you and really focus on watching the disc all the way to your hand. Concentrate also on getting the gap between your thumb and forefinger as wide as possible. The most common problem is closing your hand too early try and make yourself wait a fraction of a second longer. Playing is the best way to hone these skills but to develop your fundamental abilities isolating the one thing lets you focus on your mistakes and improve upon them.Definitely the biggest thing is just seeing the disc all the way into your hand.

5824501,0,t3_3uzgay,To me a horizontal stacks strength lies in setting up cutters away from each other so that defenders have a harder time helping each other.However I feel it has quite a few disadvantages though I will acknowledge a lot of them come from teams not running it well imo.Too many teams get caught up in the idea of lanes stay in your lane just cut in and out in your lane. The problem with this is that it presents your cutters with really one threat and so the defense only has to win a footage to one place.This is because hucks that go directly over players and especially that go directly over the receiver have a much lower margin for error. I will acknowledge this is less of an issue if you have top throwers but it still means you have to rely on a much smaller margin for error.How this translates is that the two cutters on the force side arent really deep threats. Sure if you let them go theyll catch whatever junk comes their way but so long as the defenders stay within a step of them huck options arent going to be that good. This means the defenders get to just sit a step under oh and they are on the force side so thats basically a ton of space they get to clog with no real downsides.Similarly the cutter on the far break side of the only real deep threat. If a defender sits a step deep of them they have the cutter beat deep and are equidistant from the disc. This means the cutter has to rely on superior athleticism but at that point who gives a shit what offense you run?Finally this leaves the middle break side cutter who is the only threat with more than one option.On the other hand if run properly a ho stack is fine because it follows the basic principles of cutting with the added effect of spreading out the defense to start. So long as the lanes arent set in stone and only a starting point its fine to have cutters going under in the cutting lane clearing out and setting up real deep cuts to space with a large margin for error.,ultimate,cxj48c3,1,t5_2qnym

5873173,0,t1_cxp5vc6,Calling it a layout roll might be misleading. This roll is only good for a very specific situation. Layouts are good for the disc is so far in front of me that I have to jump to get that extra foot and they typically dont allow a roll afterwards.This is good for low awkward discs that you still have to run for. It lets someone fall forward grab the disc and get back up into the action very quickly. Its not always an optimal solution but its nice to have in a players tool kit. Its also just a very good coordination and falling damage control exercise.,ultimate,cxpi6i0,3,t5_2qnym
5885684,0,t3_3vva82,It is more likely than you think that pulling IB is the suboptimal choice.However to pull it OB one need not pull it directly OB.  Rollers blades and the like can be serious weapons.Consider how much time is needed to chase down the game disc as well.As mentioned below various teams at the top level even in situations wo extenuating circumstances low numbers high wind whatever choose variations of this throughout play.The real key is that the pull determines the starting point of the disc duh.  This is the only time the defense gets to choose anything about the discs place.  So in a certain sense it is less important what statistics are available for other teams though Id be early in line to look at that info than for keeping statistics for your own team to determine where the best place for pulls on your team are.,ultimate,cxr5ahc,3,t5_2qnym

Wristbands maybe just a cheap and apparently ineffective alternative to pennies?I dont know of any videos about this but Ive run pickup at UNC for a couple years including creating a new highly competitive pickup and can probably answer some questions.How you run your pickup game will depend on context If you are starting a new game you can make this up from scratch. If you are managing an existing game figure out what peoples expectations are and go from there. We have competitive pickup which is virtually normal ultimate except teams are random and we have casual which has no stalls stacks or subs. There is also pickup in our area that is closer to traditional pickup standards run like normal ultimate with last back subbing and whitedark but competitiveness is low. What you go with should reflect the player expectations and not try to come up with something abnormal that nobody likes.The biggest thing Ive learned is to have chill if people arent playing by your preset rules but are ok with it and its not deviating too much from the style of pickup then just roll with it.Im a big fan of last back subbing and whitedark shirts and most pickups should definitely do it. You can also help encourage people to follow it pretty easily by leading by example and having it just be a thing.

Thats ColinMcIs position in the first quote in my previous post.  Im clearly reacting to the thrower though.Similar example.  Your man cuts up line and you are inside and slightly behind.  You see the thrower pivot and in response you turn and jump the throwing lane to prevent the up line throw.  Doubleteam?

While I am slightly uncomfortable with the forced nature of the USAUs policy I also fully believe that any person regardless of race color religion gender sexual orientation national origin or any other identifying feature deserves respect as a fellow human being which is the real ideal of the rainbow flag. I think the USAUs choice to use the special discs is one that is defensible as well as one that is significantly less antagonistic than many other moves they could make. If you feel that the USAU is overstepping their bounds I think that genuine and open discussion is the best way forward.In response to the core issues being debated in North Carolina and around the country I firmly believe that restrictive legislation and hatred are directly opposed to American and Christian values. As someone who was brought up in the Catholic church I think a lot of the antiLGBTQ arguments that come up bespeak a worldview very different from the one Jesus embodies in the Bible.

But I have been one of those people on your friends list this past week who have been factchecking sourceciting pseudointellectualizing and bickering over the bathroom bill discussion. First off thanks for making this post! It is always very cool on rultimate when we have star players post about themselves or games they were involved in and your post presents us with a similar opportunity an insider perspective or whatever youd like to call it. I noticed no one has responded yet so I only came in to bump and ask you a question. Thanks again!Q Can you discuss how HRT has changed you athletically or even on a more personal level if you care to? I dont know a lot about HRT and how it would affect someone athletically and I think the topic of fairness in terms of matching up gender across is the biggest question a lot of us have. I hope Im not being insensitive but I think a lot of people leaning to the more conservative POV on this subject are focused on the idea of a woman who was born male having superior athleticism to a woman who was born female. As someone who has been doing HRT for  years and who still decides as a transgender woman that she prefers to guard men what influences your decision? When do you think that decision might change? Is it a matter of fairness self principle peer pressure or something else?Again I apologize if any of this is too probing or insensitive. ,ultimate,d2mjow5,6,t5_2qnym

Hence why you get floppingdiving people will do things that they think the ref wont see. That isnt a route I want the sport to go down as it is the sportmanshipspirit that makes me enjoy ultimate. Of course you will get players who will obviously intentional make bad calls in order to benefit but often not all of their teammates will agree with them.Personally I think there needs to be some way of having spirit having some sort of effect on the overall outcome of tournamentsgames.

7504002,0,t3_4i55ui,Irv is correct sort of that there is no rule against jump passes.  There is however a rule prohibiting speeding up or changing directon after you have caught the disc which many people extrapolate into a no jumping rule. this is of course when throwing on the run once you set a pivot you are required to maintain that pivot so jumping would be a travel thereFrank has always had a strange obsession with adding basketball rules to ultimate.  There is nothing inherently interesting about basketball rules that makes them good ultimate rules.  Some changes might be fine some might not be but there is no reason to go well you can slap the ball in basketball so you should be able to in ultimate! They are different things they dont need to be the same.  Thats like saying well you cant touch the ball with your hands in soccer you shouldnt be able to in ultimate.  Offense is too easy in ultimate we should kick the disc down the field.gtgtWhat would basketball look like if you could run out of bounds pivot out of bounds take as many steps as you need not get penalized for taking too many steps and the defenders were not allowed to knock the ball out of your handsRunning out of bounds  to be comparable to ultimate lets say this is only when gathering in a pass and not while dribbing dribbling OB would be the equivalent to turfing a disc OB.  Eh not that different.  Less OB turnovers for sure but it wouldnt change the game that much assuming they have to inbound again because they cant dribble out of bounds. Pivot out of bounds  almost no change whatsoever.Take as many steps as they need  equivalent rule would be legal as long as they are slowing down cant score on the run unless its before the third step.  Not that big of a change.No penalty for too many steps  there is a penalty for this in ultimate.  Not allowed to knock the ball out of their hand  D would be weaker for sure but basketball allows much tighter body on body defense and contact without it being a foul overall it would be pretty similar game but a few less turnovers a game. In ultimate even if you got a clean slap at the disc you would probably be fouling them in other ways or violating disc space.  You are rarely going to knock the disc out of their hand since it has a handle and you will just slow the game down with constant fouling on the mark as people go for disc slaps but would increase point blocks.,ultimate,d2v5zg6,6,t5_2qnym

A defensive player in contact with or who last contacted an out of bounds area is out of bounds. They simply cant cause the disc to be out of bounds solely by touching it they have to catch it.For practical differences this means a defensive player can not jump from out of bounds and attempt a greatest because they are out of bounds when they leave the ground and that would be an invalid throw subject to turnover.

There were concerns brought up before that I think are valid in members relocating after the summer ends to go to school or work as well as changing weather and fields start to get locked up with schools back in session.Second Im not the guy you need to talk to about this. Im not arguing for the club season to shift either way. Im just pointing out that USAU has been pretty adamant about when they want to shift the club season so either you need to accept it or look for a compromise. You can try to fight it but given how long theyve been working on this my guess is that will just create friction and waste time while people are locked into what is basically a lost cause instead of trying to get things done.,ultimate,d53dkf9,-2,t5_2qnym

The interesting part was the  point advantage was only true for elite open and as you went down the advantage petered out and then when you got down to high school the advantage went to the pulling team...I looked at him and asked wouldnt that mean it would be in the receiving teams best interest to simply catch the disc and launch it right back like a counter pull?

8515685,0,t1_d65ywc9,For me it depends on how long you give the pro athletes to practice. If they have to play directly after learning the rules no throwing practice or strategy I think the frisbee team has a chance by throwing zone on D and hoping the pros dont understand how frisbees fly on O. On the other hand if you gave the pros from a major sport a couple of weeks of training camp with a decent coach its not close. Just have them throw a lot and teach them basic offensive and defensive principles. Do you think any frisbee player wins against someone like Westbrook Julio or Bale deep or in the air? How about keeping up with Messi or Curry in the handler set or trying to beat Sherman on an iso cut? To my knowledge the best athlete frisbee has ever had Peak Beau would have maybe been average for an NFL wide receiver in terms of  time and vert. ,ultimate,d660pwn,9,t5_2qnym

With only the perspective she had on the play full speed looking at the disc and then the limited information given to her by  other very biassed participants there was not enough for her to change her mind and not contest the call.

8706416,0,t1_d6trvql,Those are pretty different things in my book. Starting your cut to me means your first active move after you enter the lane whereas your change of direction is where you actually get open most of the time. Id advocate for starting your cut as the preceding throw goes up and changing direction or committing to a cut on the catch. If youre super good at jabstepping or significantly faster than your defender you can get open off a burst into a straight under or straight deep cut but if not it will take too long to cut change direction and clear if you start cutting at stall . Your thrower has one maybe two cuts to look at before they should address the reset rather than a certain two initiator  under filldeep continuation which is often the better look because youve just cleared space. Being late is usually the problem with lower level players not early. ,ultimate,d6txqhd,1,t5_2qnym

They dont want to elect a bigot and dont support his discrimination and offensive statements but also have felt like they were getting stomped on for many years and were desperate for a change in DC. Its just a tough position to be in. As such I feel like cherrypicking Trumps worst traits to suggest that individuals who voted for Trump supposedly agreed with said worst traits is unfair and counterproductive. Not saying youre saying this but many people are. In fact as many election reporters are now discussing perhaps one of the factors leading to Clintons loss mightve been that our blanket appropriation of Trump voters into one lump of hatespewing discriminatory pricks hampered our ability to have meaningful and productive discussions with them. Instead of changing their minds all that did was incite them and spur them to vote the way they did.I mean the simple reality is  million people voted for this man and I refuse to believe the alternative that all  million people are racist sexist pigs.

9678262,0,t1_da60tek,The advantage is onesided because the rules heavily favor the leading player and the defender is usually trailing. If the defender is ever in the lead then any good cutter could immediately cut in a different direction and get wide open. So it is only in a defenders best interest to be in the lead if there is only one dangerous space on the field which isnt very common.I believe that the move I described should violate a rule because it is dangerous and against the SoTG. If I was extremely competitive and was a bad person I would use that move all the time. The only way to guard against it would be to intentionally collide with me so that you could call a blocking fouldangerous play which would be cheating.Again Im not arguing against the idea of using your body to deny space to others that is something I accept and even like about the game. What I dont like is that it is legal in all situations even if you are creating a dangerous situation as long as no contact occurs.,ultimate,da61sgc,1,t5_2qnym

How will you continue to grow the division otherwise? There are some tremendous athletes who play mixed that could play on top mens or womens teams and youd be depriving people of the opportunity to watch them if you threw mixed by the wayside because its mixed. The mindset that mixed is an afterthought hurts the sport more than it helps and its arguably one of the worst aspects of the ultimate community.

The ho stack is great but requires continuous team chemistry and understanding your role. Side stack is not desirable because continuation is so difficult.

10652024,0,t1_ddeger0,There are several arguments to be made why people would be motivated to watch mixed sports but Ill give you two Many people watch sports for the narratives. Some people always root for underdogs others root for dynasties. Some people watch for gritty defense and physical play others watch for intricate offense and high scoring shootouts. Some people prefer the rotating cast of characters intrinsic to college sports for the sense of urgency it creates others prefer to root for a franchise player over the course of a long career. The list goes on. My point is that your ideal narrative might be a contest of physical feats and athleticism and thats totally cool but if the person sitting in the stands next to you is there to watch a chess match between coaches and doesnt care so much for contested hucks even if the result of each individual play is exciting and highlight reel worthy well maybe they would prefer a league that emphasized things other than physical feats and athleticism. For some that could be mixed ultimate. I dont know how many but they certainly exist. There is an enormous body of work indicating a strong correlation between the ability of a consumer to identify with the characters in the media they consume and their interest in and enjoyment of the consumption of that media. Its why Hollywood is always casting white actors in movies about nonwhite cultures. The movie is intended primarily for a white American audience and they want to maximize profits. Its not that people are incapable of enjoying a movie that features actors who dont look like them but if you want to maximize appeal across a population then you stick with actors in the majority demographics. Or so the argument goes. Based on the same science however you could in fact make the opposite argument to maximize appeal across a population you should diversity in order to appeal to the broadest range of demographics. More men play and watch sports than women but is that because men like sports more or because there are fewer womens games available and they arent marketed the same as mens games so there arent as many women interested in watching? How many more people women would go watch an AUDL game in their city if there were women playing in it? Would it be more than the number of people men who stop going because they only want to see men play? I have no idea but its not an outlandish theory that women would be more likely to go if the AUDL was mixed and that attendance numbers might rise as a result.So thats two rational reasons why people would go watch mixed. I cant guarantee that a mixed league would be profitable but then the AUDL isnt currently profitable so that hardly seems like a valid argument against the idea of mixed pro ultimate.,ultimate,ddeoact,3,t5_2qnym

10961972,0,t3_5wjbrw,Its funny Im actually hesitating between whether I think cutting or throwing is more important and at which level.Like if you are a perfect thrower but cant get open tough stuff. Similarly if you can always get the disc but cant throw.That said I think that the minimum needed for a top handler is the ability to always create space to get a pass. That means either getting open yourself to be able to move the disc or being able to cut and then clear hard to let someone else get it. If your throws arent elite you can still go far by having handlers keep the disc active and then get it to cutters to score.This is everything from where to set up for a cut to having the explosiveness to beat your defender to having the discipline to not dance around and instead do your thing now. If a handler is getting the disc that generally means several stalls have gone by and things need to happen immediately.Next comes decision making and near perfection at basic throws. You have to be able to pick up a disc on the sideline and not turn it over. You have to have it ingrained to turn to your fellow handler if cutters are shut down and keep the disc active and if you catch a disk you need to have the discipline to look for the next throw in sequence on basic level that would be continuing the swing or throwing a huck depending on where you are. Throwing and going comes in here too because you need to be able to threaten that upline.  You also need to have all your basic backhand and forehand throws pretty much perfect. Twenty yards in just about any wind should be  completion. Dumps swings and uplines should be second nature. You should also be able to throw a flat huck out to space for someone making a good cut and some IO minor break throws and stepping around breaks are useful.From there its throws and maybe some creative cuts. Pinpoint throws that slice through a gap to your target or hucks that are put in literally the only spot that your receiver can get to. You should be able to throw full field hucks in normal wind and probably fourth plus in even fairly strong wind. You already can get this how he disc and now you need to be able to devastate a team with it.Finally I would say anything over the top. Some people would put this higher Im sure but I really dont think hammers and scoobers are super necessary.,ultimate,deaneoh,7,t5_2qnym

The rules are different.gt XVIH  It is the responsibility of all players to avoid contact in every way possiblegt Avoid contact in every way reasonable possible while still playing Ultimate. Some contact is inevitable but players have an affirmative obligation to make reasonable efforts to avoid contact.Initiating contact with an opponent because you cant be arsed to turn your head andor position yourself better is very much not in accordance with the rules. Furthermore its asking for them to take a step back you to step towards them and collide albeit at low speed because youre not actually watching them.Another difference between ultimate and soccer is that in soccer the rules are that you pull as much shit as you can without the ref noticing where in ultimate we try to follow the rules not least because its in the rules to follow the rules.gt XIXG In addition to the assumption that players will not intentionally violate the rules players are similarly expected to make every effort to avoid violating them.So whether or not you believe your opponent may let something slide is not grounds for intentionally breaking the rules. This is discussed heavily in the community because at high levels this nuance can be lost and there has been an epidemic of reckless dangerous plays and serious injuries in highly public games.

11315891,0,t3_613fu0,Gotta disagree with the practical applications here.   When youre picking up a disc youd have WAY more control just scooping the disc up with the backhand grip and throwing it with no windup basically doing exactly what you did but with a backhand grip.   As for the throw and catch definitely faster than intentionally catching with a throwing grip but again less control and more importantly youll realistically never catch a disc while standing still AND with an open teammate that close by who ALSO is in a better position for you with the next throw. Otherwise the throw that went to you wouldshould have gone to them in the first place and you could probably just catch it and throw it to them completely in control as a superior alternative.

11394394,0,t3_62i777,As others have said its situational.  Depends on what your teams defensive strategy is and where the disc is located on the field in relation to the cutters.If Im on my own without sideline help I tend to watch the throwers eyes and try to read what theyre most looking for and emphasize taking that away. I also switch my priority based on the stall count.  Late in the stall I tend to prioritize taking away the easier around dump until the last moment when I go to take away the big throw whereas earlier in the stall count I try to make the inside break a little more difficult as cutters should be timing their cuts to be open early in the count.  ,ultimate,dfnjemp,3,t5_2qnym

11452646,0,t1_dfu4tce,Definitely disagree with your first sentence.  Nationals bids should be distributed where the top N teams advance to nationals its N vs  so that the autobid is satisfied for each region.It very well may be much harder for a team to make nationals from the deeper region but if the surviving team isnt better than the team from the other region tough.  The probabilistic approach says that the  team doesnt get to go to nationals because despite being better than the team surviving the other region they dont get to go because the rest of their region is weak.  Teams should earn bids by beating other quality teams not based on how good their neighbors are.,ultimate,dfu5d28,3,t5_2qnym
11464219,0,t1_dfv4pck,I can see wheels are spinning in place so Ill be brief.gt What you describe is actually privilege not equity.Nope its equity its a mathematical variation of the term that usually isnt used in this context. ownership especially when considered as the right to share in future profits or appreciation in value. By having X of actually containing a top  team each region has a degree of equity to the top  pie.gt To balance the benefitpunishment you look at teams individually and evaluate them on their individual accomplishment vs combining them.That doesnt benefitbalance punishment it shifts benefit to team that have weaker neighbors. Meanwhile bids arent allocated to teams they are allocated to regions.gt But the problem is that when the dust settles we arent comparing  teams to . We are comparing two individual teams from different regions. Again bids are awarded to regions. The teams then have to earn them. Thus you are comparing regions and their claim to housing teams that are actually in the top .gt the  already beat all four teams in the only competition that involves them all the regular season.You cant say that for certain due to a lack of confidence in the rankings. Thats the entire reason using equity is the appropriate measurement tool.gtIn probabalistic their shot at nationals vanishes because their neighbors didnt to their part. It vanishes because being ranked in the top  does not mean they are necessarily a top  team. Thats equity. gt I shouldnt have to make my neighbors better to show Im better than you especially if I already did.Being ranked  instead of  doesnt mean you showed youre better. You showed that you are probably better.gt Your poker analogy shows flaws. I apologize for sounding crass but it isnt its just over your head.,ultimate,dfvgnje,2,t5_2qnym

11484708,0,t3_63v3ty,As a woman who has seen many women quit over the years I would say the trust issues are the biggest problems. We have indoor leagues where you play v since we have snow here so if you wanna play... and you always need at least  or  women on the field for your team to be accepted. So you get a nice ratio. Also the field is shorter so the plays are shorter the passes are shorter which makes it easier for women to learn how to handle.Getting women to play is great but I find it insulting when a guy thinks that I cant follow my girl so he poaches and ultimately his guy makes the point.Trust your women and give them responsibilities on your team calling the ups on the sideline making them handler sometimes choosing a player to call the whole game whatever works.

USAU defines it as Sustained contact with and control of a nonspinning disc.So if you catch it in the air you have possession so dropping it is the same as throwing it i.e. turnover.The accidental drop is simply a corrolary of II.O. Loss of possession due to ground contact related to a catch negates that players possession up to that point.

One of my teammates threw the disc that got caught in the wind and started coming back to her. I started thinking would it be legal to have tipped the disc in the hopes that another teammate would have a play on the disc? From my search it looks like yes tipping your own throw is legal but if you touch it again or catch? its a travel. This seems incompatible with rule XII.D. in which its an immediate turnover if the thrower catches the disc.What am I missing? That one rule is for receivers and the other is for throwers?Relevant rulesgt XV. The ReceivergtA.A player may bobble the disc in order to gain control of it but purposeful bobbling including tipping delaying guiding brushing or the like to oneselfgtgtTipping brushing etc. to someone else is legal. It is legal to tipbrush your own throw. However if after a tipbrush one is the first player to touch the disc then it is deemed a tipbrush to oneself and it is a travel.gtin order to advance the disc in any directiongtgtRemember you can bobble for the purpose of gaining control so kicking the disc up to yourself to help catch it would be legal. But tipping the disc for the purpose of evading a defender would not be legal.gtfrom where it initially was contacted is considered traveling.gtXII. TurnoversgtD.
