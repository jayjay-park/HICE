6049528,0,t3_3ycz4m,My father died this year and my mother has been essentially out of the picture now for over half a decade.  My brother knowing I would spend the day alone otherwise invited me to Christmas lunch with his inlaws. When time came however I got snubbed. Whether uninvited or forgotten I dont know.  Now what bothers me about this is not that I was looking forward to social interaction with extended relatives I spent my Christmas day playing games and watching funny videos and enjoyed it. Possibly the least awkward forced Christmas Ive had to date. Rather its the fact that I was made an assurance by someone who is supposed to come through for me and it wasnt upheld.Growing up mostly alone in a solitary environment I also lost my sense of what loneliness is. I do sometimes feel like interacting with my few friends but its not a need like thirst or arousal. The only pressure I have to change my way of living is from aforementioned friends nagging and they know my stance on that.Lastly a bit of empathetic advice  Lose some weight. Ive dropped the better part of lbs over the last three months and I have to say it feels good man. Part of the reason for my fathers death was his weight  he had experienced a number of painful andor distressing health problems from sciatica to gastric reflux to sleep apnea. Youll live a more pleasant and prolonged existence if you reduce your bodys mass to a more healthy weight. Youll feel more energetic youll sleep more comfortably and restfully and you wont have to feel concerned about being treated unfavourably because of your appearance. Not to mention itll save you a small fortune in food bills and in the longer term medical bills.  That void you can imagine where the eating used to be is really not that hard to fill with more of the movies literature smut and games.

6323579,0,t3_4289s3,This is essentially what you have just done. There are a number of women in this sub alone that run opposite to your experience. Maybe you need to reevaluate where you are meeting these women. It sounds like a matter of incompatible personalities. There certainly are patterns of seemingly vapid personalities amongst a lot of women but you must consider the possible underlying reasons behind each of these cases instead of taking it at face value. e.g. they are insecure about showing off their intelligence because they have been tormented for it in the past they are afraid of emotional intimacy and find it easier to break the ice with shallow subjects etcThere are plenty of men who fit this description as well. Its not a genderdefined trait. Its interesting that this situation is the result of either your bad luck or their poor social skills. There is a degree of personal responsibility in every interpersonal interaction isnt there? If you feel unstimulated by the conversation why dont you try to bring up something you find stimulating? Why do you lament that the women youve met want you to lead the conversation when you want them to lead the conversation?This is all intended without offense. I just subscribe to the if you want something done right do it yourself mentality. Its not on the women you run into to be interesting its on you to find interesting women. You do not exist to be the gossip rag and therapist to these women anymore than these women exist to be mentally stimulating and socially skillful for you.You should probably answer your own question before asking anyone else.

I work in an environment where the occasional gorgeous woman will come through all the eager guys start salivating.  Ill get her attention by not doing anything at all.  This is probably an unpopular opinion but if the woman doesnt give you the up and down look right at the beginning of the date just try to get the hell outta there without feeling too rejected.  If she is polite shell say lets do this again if she is an honest person shell just say no thanks.  The sting of the former hits you about  minutes after hearing it as youre walking to the subway wondering if the date went well or not.

7522462,0,t1_d2vn9x3,I find this particularly alarming at least from my own experience.Diagnosed SPD here.I am one that is capable of relationships and I form very strong bonds even if I suppose theyre private and dont affect the person Im bonded to.  It occurs rarely however.Theres a guy I started dating eight years ago.  We were on and off for the first five.  That included periods on not speaking for six months at a time being totally out of contact from one another.  Hes fairly histrionic probably diagnosable though never had any form of psychological treatment.I have love for this man and aside from my brother hes the only person I truly desire to talk to that I feel enriched by speaking with instead of flooded with the farce of this is how to speak to people a burden you must now actively engage in and try your damndest not to fuck up or be spotted as a fraud within just so that you dont hurt people or sabotage yourself.  The desire here is key.  Its more than toleration amusement or knowledgeseeking.Our biggest issue was this  He has an anxious attachment style and Im obviously the opposite.  He wanted so much more from me than I could give basically to dissolve the boundary between us in a way not atypical of average relationships but the desire may have been stronger for him which is something Im very sensitive to and freak out over.  I have dissociative panic attacks over this stuff that last upwards of an hour and put me out of commission for days.  This will sound so dramatic but its perceived by me as a true violation.  If I need to be alone or run away thats something I need.  He would do things like refuse to get out of my car after wed had a fight and I had no more to say and needed to be alone.  Or he would keep callingtexting me writing a book keeping on trying to fight or resolve whatever with me.  And the fights were usually a spin on me abandoning him.Hes not possessive a trait theres no way in hell I can stomach but the egodissolution was terrible.  Both of his parents are schizophrenic if thats gives you an idea.  I think in general schizoids need space.  Really need the space.  I cant be one with another the way a lot of nonschizoids can.  Getting close to it is maddening hell for me.  This can come off as heartless to the masses however.  Cold robotic bitch and all that.For what its worth I love him and he loves me.  In different ways.  I now live five hundred miles and a mountain range away from him and everyone I know and our relationship is healthier than ever.  Were not dating and havent been for a few years but there is an affectionate and sexual aspect of our relationship that would and does change if either of us were to date someone.  I dont have any interest in finding a significant other or dating or sex with anyone else by the way.  We have tried over and over and there is a part of me that wishes we could be a couple because I feel so bonded to him love him and think hes wonderful but it will never work.  After a while it destroys us when were together.I say that this is the healthiest its ever been.  Im not calling it healthy for the record.  But he does bring me some enjoyment nowhere near the amount of pain he brings me but eventually I miss him and the stimulation he brings.  And for what its worth I do truly care about him and his wellbeing.,Schizoid,d2x9mdp,3,t5_2qxro

10133760,0,t3_5l239t,Ill admit Ive been a bit of a bully to my younger sister over the years. Most of the time its like a dominance thing. If I wanted her to do something like move over on the couch and she refused because shes a bitch Id just push her over or pick her up and move her. Weve gotten in a lot of fights over dumb shit like that. There was one time I drove her to tears just because I wouldnt stop lightly rubbing my fingers against fabric where I was laying the very faint sound irritated her. She came over and started pulling and clawing at my feet. When Id had enough of that I kicked her in the face which resulted in a bloody nose and a lot of crying. she was like  at the time and Im about six years older. There have also been times when me just being in the same room has set her off. Shed tell me to leave then I wouldnt because fuck her. After minutes of telling me to leave shed get so frustrated that shed start crying and hitting me until I got bored of the melodrama and left. Again the last time that happened was when she was about twelve. Ive been at college since. Thats another part of the whole bullying thing. The reaction out of the victim is enjoyable. My sister is quite emotional which both irritates and amuses me. Another part is the whole transferring insecurities onto someone else. If my sister is irritating me or treating me like shit deservedly so I want her to feel worse I want to get back. Going back to my earlier years I cant say I was bullied much exactly. There was a kid who beat me up on the bus a couple times but that was only twice. There were bullies too. I didnt take any shit from them though. I had some serious anger management issues back then so if they did anything to mess with me Id fight back. I got in a lot of fights and again over really stupid stuff. Middle school was when I went full schizoid. My anger went from out of control to inexpressible. Stuff like being called a name that would have started a fight before I just brushed off and refused to let affect me. And at the same time I completely withdrew from any social interaction outside of school. In general though I dont have any reason to bully or fight with anyone anymore. Nothing matters to me enough to actually make someone feel miserable. Im completely capable of doing so. If I felt someone deserved it I wouldnt feel any remorse in hurting them. I just have no reason to. I cant really speak from the victims perspective. I havent always been the one to start fights but Im never one to back down. The second time that kid beat me up on the buss was because I through a leaf I found on floor at him for beating me up the first time. Which amuses me to this day even though I was the one who got hurt. Anyways if someone just goes along with the bullys wishes its probably because they fear conflict. ,Schizoid,dbsfmt8,2,t5_2qxro

Its not just when someone starts asking personal questions though although that would definitely be a reason and definitely Id want to get away if a stranger or aquintance did that. But with people who Im sort of becoming friends with or whatever and they like me for whatever reason then often it wont really be for any particular reason other than I just feel like they are getting too close.

And that is something I wish to avoid and also know that I cant or am not willing to necessarily meet those expectations. So I dont let it continue.

11092093,0,t1_deok0rq,My boyfriend at the time didnt want kids and was in agreement. It just freaked him out and he thought it was some serious thing and projected that on to me. I think he thought I was bothered by it like he was. I cant explain. How he acted. But basically it made him see like some burden. It was the way he seemed to projected these emotions on to me which was annoying because he wouldnt just come out and say what he thought and break up with me straight away. I dont like being misunderstood and for people to project stuff on to me etc. It was pretty ridiculous.I did think about being pregnant. In an interested detached way. So I guess it sunk in that I was pregnant but just that there wasnt anything to really consider in my mind like I thought about and it was interesting but it wasnt a big deal. Ive heard you get hormone changes when pregnant but I was only  weeks or so pregnant when I had the abortion so I dont remember feeling any different it didnt even show up on the ultrasound at first when I went so I had to come back in a couple of weeks to get another appointment as they have to be able to see the foetus to check there are abnormalities in the pregnancy I guess which would complicate the procedure. So I had it done at the earliest possible time I think basically. Thats silly and insensitive what your sister said. Just because she wants kids she cant impede on your choices. Its like projecting but for things someone wants instead of negative qualities subconsciously. Im not sure if theres a name for that. People seem to do it a lot though. Also having a baby really doesnt appeal to me. I wouldnt choose to. I dont find babies or even kids cute at all. And I really wouldnt like it when they are a baby. And the thought of being pregnant and giving birth grosses me out so much. Ew. Its pretty disgusting. The whole thing sounds weird. I dont have any  However I also wouldnt mind some aspects of it like maybe it could be interesting and teaching it stuff when it gets old enough to speak. Its not something I want or my thing but if I was in a relationship and they wanted one then I can imagine just being like yeah ok. But as long as it was the right time and I thought it would have a decent life. To be honest one appealing aspect would be to prove to myself that Im not like my mother. And that Im not abusive and wouldnt mistreat a child. That I could give it a really good upbringing unlike what I had. But I know thats like over compensating for my fear that Im like my mother and trying to somehow right the wrongs of my childhood so to speak. And I dont have to do that. I dont really feel the need to do that as Id prefer not to have kids. Why are you thinking of this now anyway? ,Schizoid,depa1qz,2,t5_2qxro

I could go to school wearing nothing but a sweatshirt and shorts no underwear or anything underneath in the middle of winter then go home without changing my clothes and sleep in a sleeping bag on my bed because I couldnt be bothered to do my laundry or change my sheets. Its disgusting now that I look back on it but I was completely fine with that at the time. Not to mention spending summers never talking to anyone and spending all my free time playing games. Part of the issue with mental disorders is the inability to see that you are in fact disordered. The issue with SPD in a lot of cases is an inability to care about things you really should care about. ,Schizoid,dff7968,10,t5_2qxro
11323760,0,t1_dffilxz,To be blunt I cant even understand what the first question is supposed to mean.   I do what I do.   I am content.I do not network.  I do not socialize.   I work alone.    I entered the work environment by giving my initial resume to a placement agency.   They placed me in a salaried position.   I got poached relatively quickly and am a carefully protected by the owner.I continue as always.   I do what I do.    The owner turns it into a lot of money and gives me some so I dont run out of coffee and key lime pie.,Schizoid,dffj2lw,6,t5_2qxro
11340442,0,t3_61tf8n,As far as being more unique I can be really sociable and no one would ever guess that I just put on a happy face to go through the motions of social interactions. Its enough to get me by because no one really presses me for further interaction lol. I like to sing and physically play music thats pretty nonschizoid I think. I am understanding of emotions even though I never get deep with other people.I have anxiety. I realized though that I havent had a panic attack since I stopped going to school. So I think you could just chalk it up to stress. When I experienced it though it just enabled the schizoid tendencies holing myself up in my room failing to fulfill obligations. It was a good excuse.I can be really sympathetic to a wide variety of causes. I think most people here arent as much. Thats just an assumption though.Edit I cant believe I forgot this lol I dont do the fantasy thing,Schizoid,dfhf3x8,8,t5_2qxro

11533992,0,t1_dg2heys,Yes very afraid of flying lol. I suppose a train might be possible but the extra travel seems unappealing.Have you come across tourists yourself before? I will keep that in mind though. I woul like to travel someday.Its true that the places I want to travel to are relatively safe especially Japan and Hawaii as I understand it but when you travel internationally I assume the risk for danger goes up. Maybe thats just a homebody thing p,Schizoid,dg3dp6d,2,t5_2qxro
11559967,0,t3_647ni7,Truth is we dont care. We dont sense enough emotion to care. If you tell them just dint be surprised if they make a weird face on you.What I mean is that almost all of us have to keep it a secret as long as we achieve something from the relationship.

11595651,0,t3_64ykzo,I looked into Pua a few years ago and I learned the basics and must admit it does work quite well..if you are decent looking and know the basics of Pua you can get quite a few women interested..thing is I find the game overall to be mind numbingly boring..the idea that I can mentally manipulate a woman into sleeping with me is a turn off in itself..then again im not really into sex that much do..  You get social skills by practicing and watching social people interact..just sit and listen the next time you are around a group of people..listen to what they say when they interrupt someone else etc etc..,Schizoid,dgadiz7,2,t5_2qxro

11615638,0,t3_650ve8,. Highly doubt it. Bet most schizoid IQs are normal or maybe a little above average.. I care about animals... not to the point where Im a vegetarian though. I have a pet cat and many fish. Theyre my hobbies. I dont think caring about animals has anything to do with it. Many of us care about people too just at an extreme distance. . With other people? Umm yeah. Your sex drive has nothing to do with your schizoidness.  of us have a sex drive. We just dont really enjoy sex with other people or find it an emotional experience. By the way yes you can have friends and be schizoid. I have friends I just cant bear to see them for much longer than an hour at a time. If something awful happened to one of them Id feel bad.... but at a distance. Does that make any sense? Its not about lacking empathy. That would be sociopathy. I find SPD to be sort of kittycorner to sociopathy and completely opposite of borderline. Of course theoretically its possible to be schizoid and borderline I just find my symptoms to be very opposite. Borderlines think in black and white for example. Everyone does to an extent but I feel that the average schizoid sees things in a very grey manner. BPD people experience extreme mood swings caused by little things schizoids have very flat moods and are unaffected by most things. BPD people feed off drama thats not a diagnostic symptom so forgive me if you find this to be wrongits more of an observation schizoid people couldnt care less. BPD people have attachment issues. Schizoids dont get attached. ,Schizoid,dgcn5fy,1,t5_2qxro

11755554,0,t3_67qt9c,Nothing in reality can ever be known with absolute certainty. Thus one must rely on inductive reasoning whereby sufficiently controlled correlations can be regarded as causation after ruling out all other possibilities. The concept of Occams Razor also applies here. The argument with the least assumptions must be taken as the correct one. In your case if all information sources have one bias or another and you take information from a sufficient quantity of sources then inductively the commonalities between them should be regarded as true unless proven otherwise. To reject all sources of information as false due to some inherent bias would be irrational. As would ignoring any bias a particular source could have.Now the deeper question you get at is whether or not people care to think this logically about the world they are in or the information they consume and the answer is no. ,Schizoid,dgsisfm,5,t5_2qxro
