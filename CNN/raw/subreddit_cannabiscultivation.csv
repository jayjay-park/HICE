3283459,0,t3_2xe86j,mde is correct. DO NOT use led. Especially on what appears to be your first grow. For the space I would definitely go with two w lights. Make sure you have enough power to cover to handle that and MORE. I would Definitly get vented hoods. You said you are venting out through carbon. Make sure you are bringing in air also. If you are running a SEALED room then no need for either. Just bring cool air through your vented lights and out. No need for carbon if just running cool air to cool the lights. If not running a complete sealed room. Then vent out of your carbon and bring air in. Spend the money on CO!!! Do not take short cuts as they will end up costing you a lot more in the long run. Good luck!!,cannabiscultivation,cp2jhnv,2,t5_2qt87

10696487,0,t1_ddhs821,Actually man I looked at Royalqueenseeds article on  and it would work to force flower from seed. If you started  at  days it would still continue to veg for a while until it flowered. If you do  from seed it will be a much smaller plant and itd flower sooner than starting after  days even though it wont flower until  weeks have passed,cannabiscultivation,ddj9h8d,1,t5_2qt87

11279117,0,t1_df9aukp,well I dont even think its trolls so much as jerks who want to be the best so could they care less about others succeeding. its quite sad. thatll never help us actually move forward with the legalization effort. cause negativity is negativity. and the people fighting cannabis would be thrilled if no one grew it anymore.also here is a list of movies that will get you totally understanding the basics. if you watch all of them you probably will be able to kinda grasp everything youll be facing as that little lady matures.several hours of growing guides and tips from sources you can trust to know a bit about the plant,cannabiscultivation,dfagzei,1,t5_2qt87

11541372,0,t1_dg45m3l,Thats correct. Milk based edible shake. Traditionally its made on holi the Indian festival of colors. It is illegal  cultivation possession and consumption  but the Indian gov seems to look the other way. Note that bhang predates any drug policy,cannabiscultivation,dg47snb,2,t5_2qt87
