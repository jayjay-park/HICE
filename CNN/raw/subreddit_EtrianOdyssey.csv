In fact I probably wouldnt have heard of the Etrian Odyssey series if not for it!  For those curious I own PMD Red and Blue the DS version of Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer PMD Explorers of Time and Sky and Final Fantasy Fables Chocobos Dungeon.Based on what Ive heard from the rest of you EMD seems to be very good so Im very excited to purchase it.

4084696,0,t3_379uwe,Quick thing I wrote up in a few minutes.Team BuildingFor the most wellbalanced lineup take a Fortress a healing class of some sort Medic for now theres another unlockable healerish class later on and the other  members should probably be damage output or status effect users. This is mostly preference TBH. Whatever you think is cool go for it. I recommend diversifying your team but again if you really like one class you can make a whole party of them if thats what floats your boat. Also I highly recommend you go with  members in your party. Leveling is slower EXP is spread out across  characters but overall the game is balanced around having  ppl in a party so yeah. MinMaxing isnt much of an issue for EO until really far into the game so I recommend you just go with classes you like or classes that feel good.How to earn moneyGo into an area youve already cleared beat the shit out of a bunch of them return to town and sell everything. Alternately if you can beat FOEs farm those instead. Gathering is another potential source of revenue but realistically unfeasible unless you want to make gathering characters not worth it.Another potential source is the Air Balloon read on.Air BalloonIts the overworld in this game. You unlock the ability to fly higher as you progress through the game. Youll be using it for quests to find new dungeons and eventually to fight overworld FOEs and progress through to new zones. There are some food gathering points scattered across the overworld that you can gather by flying over them and collecting them.

Their songs provide nice buffs their Force boost can keep said buffs running forever when paired with Force Shield grimoire and you could even slap a Link Order III grimoire to chase elemental attacks on down turns.Or if you want to try the ailment reliant route swap out any  attackers and your Medic for a Hexer War Mage and Dark Hunter. You can still get your necessary healing while taking advantage of Ailing Slash and Vampire when your Hexer slaps ailmentsbinds on the opponents.

6951534,0,t3_4ankhn,A lot of people like  the best actually.  Number three was still great but the multiclassing was implemented in such a way that your characters were less about strictly unique classes and more just two pools of skills to be minmaxed.If I recall correctly  was the last one to have d monsters.  I found the d art more expressive and stylized than the d models.  The d models were never that impressive or unique looking.  At least they kept the character portraits in d.I guess the only thing is that no one chooses Etrian  for their favorite?

9211954,0,t3_56h4gz,This is something I came up with on the spot but a weird as heck class that only has passives and support skills no active damage dealing ones. And I dont mean something like a Troubadour or a Dancer I want the class to be a damage dealer and it would set up with its support skills so when you either press Attack or Guard it does something special. Like if you simply do a basic attack after it does some support skill it does something niche and attacks with a charged buff. Or the class can have a passive that makes it do damage ignoring resistances or something. Dont know how itd look like though.I also want some kind of class that does niche things over moving between rows. Like if we take the Hoplites two spear skills Switch Stab and Long Stride and make the class be all about that. The class can perform a skill that makes it switch rows and bring it to the back row and then have it perform something like Long Stride which then brings it to the front row which Long Stride doesnt do and as well do more damage since the attack came from the back row. The class could be something like a Cavalier or some kind of speedy character with leg boosters. Theres also a want for that th Dragon III aesthetic in an EO game where we have these futuristic classes and we can have an Idol or something be in the game. Sadly it would be so close to copyright then huh. ,EtrianOdyssey,d8jomdo,3,t5_2tor2

9752134,0,t3_5eqdc6,Acea has already covered most of the important points but I will add some of my own suggestions. If you keep the party as is add a Gunner or Alchemist for Spear Assist. Gunner is more preferred since Burst Shot turns Spear Assist into a Quad Elemental attack Stab  Fire  Ice  Volt that makes it really easy to get the Conditional Drops from the Dragon Trio as well as some others. If youre going to run Vital Hit as a major offensive component you want two Medics to do so  one to use use Overheal on the party and the other to actually attack with Vital Hit. Its either that or you keep the single Medic relegating Vital Hit to supplementary damage and then put more stock into the Beast using Wolf Fang which is similar to Vital Hit but with different scaling mechanics.,EtrianOdyssey,daf6136,2,t5_2tor2

With subclass you get access to that classes skills except the foraging skills cooking skills and the proficiency skills I think. Also the levels of the subclass skills will be halved. They will also be able to access the armor and weapons the subclass can use as well I believe. The strength of the skills also depend on stats like STR TEC VIT AGI and LUC of the unit as well as what level the skill is.  You get subclass about halfway through the third maze. Foraging skills are only one point and you can always rest your SP if you dont want them. I personally have points in all three types of foraging skills when I play.,EtrianOdyssey,db2m5or,7,t5_2tor2

10273626,0,t3_5lbb6w,Im pretty sure youve probably killed dream eaters by now but for referenceShield  speedHeavy Armor  speedMedium Armor  speedLight Armor  speedGloves  speedShoes  speedAccessories and helms are neutral.Gunblade  speedHammers  speedSwords  speedThrusting Swords  speedKatanas  speedDaggers  speedBows and staves are neutral.Some skills start with negative action speed others start with higher action speed.Each point of AGI adds a point of speed.The game rolls a random number between  each turn for every individual and adds that number to their speed.Ive used this information for my current dancer party run. Refresh waltz dancer had shoes light armor and a status daggerbowfor backliner iirc. And if you ever play the other EOs pretty sure these bonuses also apply to those games.,EtrianOdyssey,dc8kkx8,1,t5_2tor2

10674976,0,t1_ddfs8et,You can also just put  points into Spotter and give your Sniper an accuracy accessory and that will get you hitting nearly every shot. Honestly worth it considering all of the evasion disabling stuff isnt guaranteed and has resistances so it costs extra TP from your Arcanist or sub Arc.,EtrianOdyssey,ddh1kbp,2,t5_2tor2

10687288,0,t3_5sovzc,Offtopic but am currently playing EO. I see a couple things already translated Like the title of the game on my DS is already been translated to Etrian Odyssey V  Beyond the Legends. Also ingame stuff like Map mechanics with Zoom Map Lock and Auto Pilot already being in English as well as town buildings  what you can do seems to already have been translated. Stuff like Inn  RestStorageSave etc I dont know if other japanese games do this especially if Atlus games or EO games do this as well but would be safe to say that a localization IS already planned if some stuff is translated?,EtrianOdyssey,ddibbe0,1,t5_2tor2
10855262,0,t1_ddway45,You say that but its got to be economical for them.  EOU had the lowest sales yet in the series for a variety of reasons.  And that was using Japans sales figures Im not sure about US sales.,EtrianOdyssey,ddzn6c3,1,t5_2tor2
11437228,0,t1_dfrspf6,Is that really how they did things? I came into the series after every game so far had been released.,EtrianOdyssey,dfsed61,1,t5_2tor2
11522428,0,t3_64c6xy,I liked it while playing th Dragon Id be stoked to see it in EO. They already have modelled enemies and mainline EO titles usually have comparatively low amount of classes.I mean in EOIV we did have three boss fights which are kinda almost there already.,EtrianOdyssey,dg22hur,2,t5_2tor2
11763891,0,t3_67ofwv,I think we were getting spoiled with so many EO titles over the last few years. We got  two Untold titles and EMD in a span of  years. For most of my time following this series it has been the redheaded stepchild of Atluss properties. Were right back where we belong ladies and gents.,EtrianOdyssey,dgtgsyj,4,t5_2tor2

11773986,0,t3_680495,No confirmation but it gives me hope that it says TBA under release time instead of exclusive Japan release.,EtrianOdyssey,dgum6ar,-4,t5_2tor2
