124799,0,t1_cerxucl,No you do not inherit the same as your siblings. Siblings can inherit completely different pieces of autosomal DNA. That helps explain why one sibling might look or act completely differently than their other siblings.Think of it like this Each person has a bowl. Your ancestors DNA are bits of salad thrown high into the air. Only a certain amount can fill the bowl the rest lands outside it.Everyone inherits different pieces in their bowl. Of course if the ancestry is mostly carrots or celery or eggplant...youll see that more often no matter what. If the ancestry is really varied though or sometimes anyway you can see one sibling with nothing but carrot when most of their family CURRENTLY is celery.,Genealogy,cesn5up,1,t5_2qmdf

Im certainly not even remotely Orcadian in the last  years.Anyway it turns out that estimated your autosomal ethnic heritage is less of a science and more of a subjective art with some ethnicities like British being more  notoriously difficult to categorise.This article was a goldmine for me understanding my results.From what I understand the DNA companies use a selection of pure ethnic samples to represent wider continental ancestral populations.

No one else in my family has ever been interested in genealogy so I dont really have a reliable source for stories and  personal information.

2626196,0,t1_cn19n8t,What I found interesting is that in the marriage record of Marie Deray and Pierre Dufosse while Pierres father signed Maries did not and instead only her brothers did. This made me wonder if the brothers were actually biological but the parents had passed away prior to Maries marriage.I ended up looking into Parish Records for Huchenneville and though it also seems quite small both Dufosse and Deray are common in the records. There is a  death record for a Jeanne Le Clery in GrebaultMesnil listed as the wife of Pierre Dufosse which I found interesting as I have found no death record for Marie Deray and found no evidence of a second Pierre Dufosse existing at the time in the area.  I am not  sure that the relationship stated is wife but it does look like it. That record is here bottom left Any help is appreciated.Edit Now that you mention it I may have been confused. I believe I may have been thinking of a will for a french man who passed away in England which was written in a mix of languages. I apologize for the confusion.

2713549,0,t1_cnchbn1,Well Im pretty sure it was Leith there is a river named Leith in southern Scotland called the Water of Leith and there is a district of Edinburgh called Leith where the river empties and a Leith Hall which I know is tied to my family. Theyre minor nobilityland wards Which is why Im surprised that I cant find any reliable records. This particular Leith was supposedly the one who built Leith hall John but it doesnt help that of course he had a son named John that I am not descended from it would be his brother James or Alexander I keep getting conflicting information on which one this is who had a son named John and they had ancestors named John. So yeah having fun with that. I just didnt know if there was an off chance that my family is Leath and not Leith and that Im basically barking up the wrong tree. So far though most records are centered around southern Scotland ranging from Aberdeen to Fife to Midlothian. And there is a John Leith found in each of those from around the same time and yet they seem to be the same John similar yet variant names in immediate family.Variant spellings though are Leath Leythe and Lethe and from what I can tell consistently Ive been using Ancestry.com to keep track of things though its not the only place Ive been using as a resource for records this is what I have so with this partIsobels family is very well documented records for her family go very very far back but the Leith family is harder to pin down I dont know if they only became that prominent in Johns lifetime so before him isnt as well recorded or what.

3644888,0,t3_323ieo,Good luck!  Ive been manually tracking couples that show up frequently among matches and finding some promising clues. For example there are some where Ive originally thought there couldnt be a connection but months later Id learn that someone close to the couple had lived  miles from my known ancestors in Ireland. That tells me that at least in some cases I am on the right track. Its cool because the unexpected connections names locations ethnicities stand out more among matches and those can be fascinating for example even though my grandparents didnt leave Ireland until the s we have a ton of DNA matches that point to the US Southern colonies. My working theory is that some families sent one son to the Virginia plantation and another one to the Ulster plantation both of which occurred in the first quarter of the th century. Even though I dont have certificates to prove descent and in some cases they may not exist I can build up a case on Unexpected DNA matches and historical documents. I hope the new ancestry feature would help me find some of these common ancestors but it hasnt yet.

4704518,0,t3_3fbzog,I think the biggest mistake beginners make is not documenting sources of information.  Beginners also tend to copy family trees or other genealogists information and treat it as fact not as a hint.  A source could be listed as  Louis J. Stiers story KY Death Certificate Ancestry.com tree of xxx or Chicago Tribune  July  page  Stier Obituary.  Vital records and Census records are great places to begin their search.   Is the record a primary record that the ancestor herself provided the information? Birth record marriage record WW draft registration. A death record has information given by an informant who may be a distant relative or  may not really know the information as fact but as their best recollection.  Census information can vary depending on who answered the door and gave the information to the government official who knocked on the door.  A family researcher should also know what government level the vital records are housed depending upon the year and how the system in that area is set up.  Certain records in one state may be kept at the county courthouse but in another state vital records are kept in the town where the event occured.  If you dont know the exact date list it as about  or before .  Genealogists usually list dates as day month year.  Women are listed under their maiden name.  Names may have many variations Elizabeth Lizzie Betty etc and last names are often written as they sounded Stier Steer  Stir Stear  Seer etc.  I would give copies of family group sheets and a  generation work sheet. I would also give a list of free websites to use.  The local public library in the town their relatives are from may have local obituaries and biographies.  Join a local historical society.

5031273,0,t3_3ju32r,The record you link to is his pension index card and thats an official record so you can take it as valid. Assuming your guy and this guy are the same person. Pensions werent originally issued simply for service which is why this one is dated . You dont say when he was probably born but thats  years after the war ended so he was likely getting on in years. Hence the invalid pension.However this is only for his application. It doesnt indicate that the pension was ever actually issued so he may never have received it. You really need to send for his complete application file. This page at NARA will get you started. Its not free but not expensive either.Even on the Union side there are often errors in the grassroots records  the local enlistments state musters compiled by AG offices and so on  so I wouldnt worry too much about his absence from the Maryland records.Do you know the death date? And have you found an obit? If he lived most of his later life in Chicago you can check with the Chicago Historical Society for records of the local chapters of various Union veterans groups. They may have them but they ought at least to know where they are.Theres also a nd Maryland Infantry bibliography you can rummage through for clues.

I would tend to believe that contacting the Gniezno archive by email would be faster and possibly cheaper. EDIT I also searched for Louis Szymkowiak and Maria Olejniczaks marriage record on the Poznan Projects website. Since Louis is an English name I decided to search for its Polish version Ludwik.

5298255,0,t3_3nkkt7,gtDo cemeteries that have abandoned family plots use them for burials?Yes.  Peoplefamilies buy plots all the time and fhen forget to inform survivors who then end up buying them completely new plots after they die.  Sometimes no immediate family even remain to inter in those available plots.  Most places have laws that allow resale of the vacant plots once a certain time period has passed and the cemetery has made a goodfaith attempt to contact any remaining possible heirs about the vacant spaces.  Otherwise there would be unused spaces that could be put to use.gtWhat other scenarios might be happening?In many countries the family plot is simply rented out from the cemetery for however many generations their heirs are willing to pay for upkeep and then after a period of nonpayment the cemetery exhumes the bodies cremates the remains and reburies them in one giant communal plot and then rerents out the original spaces.

5415459,0,t3_3p1io3,Of course every case is different but I may have some suggestions. I have  German ancestors all coming from different places in Germany and after a while I managed to trace all of them back all by different means. There might be differences as they migrated to Brazil instead of US but many of the difficulties might be similar. I will just tell the full story and you can extract what you find valuable to your case. My greatgrandfather called Theodoro Nilles was always listed as German in the civil records. His parents were also described as German. There was nothing about them online in any genealogy database as far as I knew. Not that many church records either. I looked for them in digitised newspapers archives and found they had been involved in a legal dispute and prosecuted. Then with the date of this occurrence and their names I was able to find the police records where their names age and place of residence in Germany were declared. And only then I found them in the German records.. His wife was the daughter of two German immigrants. Her father was called Pedro or Pedromax Eilert in Brazil. His death certificate said German but nothing else. It was difficult to find any church records since they were Protestant and most of the records there are Catholic. With his complete date of death however I was able to find him in the cemetery records. The burial record gave me his full name Peter Max Friedrich Eilert and his complete date of birth. This was of little use as he wasnt on any genealogy database either. Some time later it occurred to me to look for his name and date of birth combined and written in German rather than in English i.e. . Mrz instead of  March and then yes his name turned up on an emmigrants list stating his place of birth. And only then I could find him on the German records.. The wife of Peter Eilert was the easiest to locate as her and her parents are on the familysearch records database. The difficulty here was to identify her mothers maiden name which was only made possible after flipping page after page of church books in Brazil where her brother on one single occasion declared her maiden surname as well the married surname.Maybe you have done all that but looking at the info you posted I would Look for burial records? Look for their marriage records? If they married in Germany you could try to identify a place where there is a significant amount of Hollnagels and Jacobs. Of they married in the US they might have come each from one location.... Look for them on passengers lists? This is one is known to be helpful for many althought it wasnt the case for me.Happy hunting!! ,Genealogy,cw3vtka,2,t5_2qmdf

6342481,0,t3_42hn6v,gtName Andreas Karpinski German or Polish name or other?Polish last name. gtOn four American censuses up to  and his naturalization he identifies himself and his parents coming from Germany. In fact one says he was from Dortmund or Dortmunt Germany which does not sound Polish??He probably grew up in Dortmund Germany and identified himself as German. But his family originally came from what is Poland today. They were most likely part of the great migration from Germanoccupied rural Poland to the German cities west of the Oder river.  Dortmund is a big city in the Ruhrpott an area known for coal mining ore smelting and steel production. During the th century industrial revolution happened people moved from rural Poland to cities in Germany for work in the mines and the factories. Many ethnic Poles ended up in the RhineRuhrArea. About  of all Germans living in Germany today have at least one Polish greatgrandparent and Polish last names are very common especially in the Ruhrpott. gtBut family believes he was Polish. Yet he spoke German when coming to the US...normal for a Polish person in ? If he was born to Polish parents in Dortmund and went to school in Dortmund it would be totally normal that he spoke German and almost no Polish. Even if he grew up in what is today Poland it would be normal for him to speak at least some German. The main administrative language was German and it would be hard for a person who spoke only Polish to find a wellpaying job. Think of Latin American immigrants in the US who speak only Spanish. Additionally there was significant intermixture between the German and the Polish population a Polish or German last name meant very little. Identity was shaped by religion catholic or protestant? the main language spoken at home Polish or German? and how other family members identified themselves. gtI cant find any records of Andreas when in Europe which is very frustrating.That is because Germany is about  years behind when it comes to putting records online.  Additionally there are strict data protection laws that you might run into. But I found this entry from the adressbook of Dortmund in  Beruf professionBergmann minerFamilienname last nameKarpincki Vorname first nameAndreas Adresse adressRheinische Strasse  OrtDortmund  This adress is today in  DortmundDorstfeld if the adress is still the same chances are he worked in the Dorstfeld mine gtChild was Greta Margaret Karpinski who was born in Germany very near to the  emigration date.Since the last place of residency of the family was clearly Dortmund I would request her birth certificate from the Standesamt in Dortmund. Note that her birth was less than  years ago so you might need to proof that you are a direct descendant. Write an email to urkundenstelledortmund.de  urkundenstellestadtdo.de in German!!! . Be prepared to include scans of your birth certificate your parents marriage and birth certificates and so on. Important You want an Auszug aus dem Geburtenregister inklusive aller Randvermerke excerpt from the register of births including all remarks in the margins if you ask for a birth certificate you might get a newly issued certificate dated from  with the federal eagle without all the neat details the original entry contains.  Costs are  EUR plus an optional search fee that varies depending how many records they have to search. For the birth record of Andreas and the marriage record assuming both happened in Dortmund I would contact the town archive of Dortmund. stadtarchivdortmundstadtdo.degtBut...it lists his birthday as  Nov  which Im pretty sure is not correct but is close to  APR .No freaking way that this is the same guy. German records are meticulously kept and people living in the Prussian police state where you could not even leave your village without a travel permit from the local administration in the village knew their birth dates. If you have a record that your ancestor was born on nd April  you need to find a birth record of an Andreas Karpinski born on April nd .

6981101,0,t3_4bav3g,Hey! Haplogroup stuff is confusing let me know if this helps. You have two haplogroups your maternal aka H from your mother and your paternal I from your father. The maternal is carried on your mitochondrial DNA and your fathers is carried on your Y  chromosome. The paternal haplogroup marker is passed down from father to son in an unbroken chain  every son has a father. It can only be passed from father to son because it is carried on the Y chromosome which females do not have. If you are a female you cannot know what your paternal haplogroup is unless a male relative father brother paternal uncle paternal grandfather is tested. The maternal haplogroup is likewise passed on from mother to daughter in an unbroken chain  as a son you inherit your mothers maternal haplogroup marker but you will not pass it on to any children son or daughter. If you have a child you will only pass on your I haplogroup if you have a son  the maternal haplogroup will be provided by the childs mother.  But every one person has both markers because every one person has both a mother and a father. ,Genealogy,d17nah5,4,t5_2qmdf

You dont have to use those questions but they are their as a guide if you want to use them to help give you ideas. Second Pass It Down allows you to tell a story in multimedia which allows you to tell the story in a way that they are comfortable with. For example my grandma doesnt really feel comfortable being on video that often but she loves being able to tell a story in audio and I can add photos and text to that story. My grandfather George on the other hand loves being on video so I have been able to capture his stories on video and add photos and text to those stories as well. Finally by creating a digital story you can easily share that story with all your relatives around the world. Eventually we will be able to tie those records in to family trees offered by the big genealogy companies! Hope this helps and if you have any more questions let me know.

I took an Ancesty test because I am adopted and never knew my heritage so I was interested in that end of it but I never expected to get the information I did. I was an anomaly and actually got a direct hit on my bio father. I could then eliminate the common matches with him and with a little work figured out my mother. My point being is the predicted relationships are either exact out to th cousins or are very close. One on my th cousins was rd once removed and the like but it is like witchcraft what they can deduce.As far as predicting heritage it isnt quite as exact but they are pretty close. They give you a predicted percentage but it is really a range. It predicted  English for me but based on the tree I have now it is probably closer to . Now when taken as a whole they got all of the big areas right but with European migration patterns it can be tricky to be exact.I guess it all depends on what you want from it.,Genealogy,d2dz2t4,2,t5_2qmdf

So Im certain my grandfathers notes have been taken from someone who has done research in church books etc because all the dates marriages and all the childrens are accounted for.Here are the papers I got from my grandfather.   easiest to look at the computer written copy at the bottom made by my uncle rd picture. They are in swedish but here is what you need to read itFdd  BornDd  DeadGift med  Married toBarn  Children The line goes from top to bottom starting with Carl Jnsson Sabelskld the knighted one.  And then their child who I am descendant from is underlined. And in the next paragraph they continue with that childs dates of birth and death then their spouse and their dates of birth and deathThen their children again the underlined is my ancestor too. etc. etc.To note is that my grandfather made a mistake copying this because from the research Ive made online the Carl Sabelskld in the second paragraph married to Elisabeth Dureus is actually the son of the first Carl Sabelsklds oldest son Jns Sabelskld. The dates of birth and everything else are correct he just skipped him in the copying.I need to find the one who did the research. Ive contacted them on their website asking if they can confirm the lineage. Apparently they have records of members ancestry research saved so I hope to get confirmation that way.

7803042,0,t3_4m4ewz,So I hate to be the Debbie Downer here but when you start getting to th Century Royalty while not outside the realm of possibility that you have an actual verifiable trail of records since those do exist for some people it is the records themselves that are notable not the actual nature of descent.  Once you are getting to  or  or  generations back the pedigree collapse is incredibly huge and the number of theoretical ancestors you possess far exceeds the population of the planet at the time      . This is obviously impossible and is an easy way to illustrate that in fact we are talking about the common ancestors of pretty much every human being of European descent. It is also demonstrated by studies of genetic ancestry which backs up our napkinback math finding that even geographically distant Europeans share ubiquitous common ancestry within the past  years. The goto figure for Everyone is descended from him is Charlemagne since not only is his name known but he also had a number of children and we can track their movements and those of their children around Europe but it similarly holds true for other figures who lived many hundreds of years ago and it is a safe assumption that most European royalty of the period could be advanced for a similar claim as long as they did have progeny. Now that all being said I dont want to totally rain on your parade here. Just because of our common European descent Hi th cousin! means that we all are related to the notable figures who lived  years ago doesnt mean that we all know how we do and for me that is the legitimately cool thing about genealogy finding those paths. A family tree once you start going back enough generations or only a few in some places... is really better thought of as a family web since as I noted while you have  theoretical ancestors  generations back the actual number of real people is much smaller. If we assume a generation is  years and the totally unfounded assumption that ancestry is evenly distributed around the globe that means that  years ago when the world population was around  then each person of the th generation would actually appear  times and also a few times in the th or st... since generations dont keep perfect pace. So this means there are an incredible number of paths which you can follow to reach any given person... but how many were ever recorded let alone remain intact and accessible? Someone like Queen Elizabeth II can do it easily since her lineage is through notable figures but for many out of those literally billions of threads that your ancestry traces through who knows if even a single one still remains. And if there is one out there to be found it can be quite the slog as many on thus sub can no doubt attest. We cant all say Well King George was my dad and King George was his dad and King Eddie was hiiis dad. Centuries ago King Bob had ten kids... the rd daughter got married to a Duke their th son was only a Baron and his rd daughter married a wealthy but nonnoble landowner who gambled it all away and their kids faded into obscurity and in only a few generations youve gone from royalty to insignificant and a few generations from there quite possibly lose any records that would have gotten you back there.While Ive been fortunate enough on my fathers side to find many good solid records at least into the th century and a few tantalizing hints beyond on my mothers side it is nearly impossible to find information that reaches even into the th century so the contrast can be really quite stark and being able to reconstruct those records can often be very rare.So what this is all to say is... dont get too caught up in the holy shit Im descended from a th century King! Do get caught up in being able to trace how you get there though because that is a legitimately rare treat for doing this kind of research once youve followed ustrohbies advice of course...  It is tempting to jump on those vague hints  and plenty of people make trees that arent well supported. They are only cheating themselves and you should never take their work for granted.

You always have to explain to people what it means so that part is just bragging rights.I used to work with a genealogy librarian who was a also a CG an NGS board member and a teacher at Samford who qualified himself for at least two dozen lineage societies mostly because he considered it good advertising for his professional skills.I should add that Im also in the General Society of the War of  on several lines redandwhite rosette which is a much smaller group than SAR because it was a much smaller war. My Dad paid the fees on that one back in the s for him me and my brother and I did all the actual work on the application. He was a career Army officer and it simply tickled him to belong to such a specialized military lineage society.,Genealogy,d52px4n,9,t5_2qmdf

8246698,0,t3_4sb0im,I joined a couple of years ago purely for access to their genealogy database of proofs downloadable for  per lineage. I had hoped to push through a brick wall with respect to one of my VirginiaNorth Carolina ancestors. I only managed to knock out a chunk of mortar with respect to that particular ancestor but I still have hope of getting through eventually.The database and lineage information available for free did help me shore up proof for a couple of other lines and I was able to find out more about the Revolutionary War service of several other ancestors that I hadnt known before. I knew ahead of time that I had at least  direct ancestors that would qualify me for membership from New England to South Carolina.The members are very nice and some were acquaintances before I joined. That being said they pray a lot  too much for my taste. Then again I live in a southern city where theres an annoying amount of religion. They start and end meetings with prayers and bless the food before eating it. I dont know if all chapters do this. Theres a lot of flagwaving too which I think is kind of silly. I like talking about history but the level of mindless patriotism is a bit over the top. I am mindful of how when and why the organization started and take that into consideration though.The chapter I joined has regular meetings with a speaker on some aspect of either history of genealogy so its interesting and enjoyable from that perspective. The meetings happen in the homes of members at public places like museums etc. I know a couple of women who say they are joining specifically for access to the scholarships for their children. Based on what Ive read on the DAR website though I dont think there are enough scholarship awards to make the odds of winning one worth the price and effort of joining for that reason alone.,Genealogy,d58e5ik,6,t5_2qmdf

8605914,0,t1_d6go9pu,Hello and thank you for your feedback. Regarding the state field I explained in an earlier post in response to someone else that the field can be input with any other political subdivision as appropriate i.e. province territory etc. so please feel free to input what is relevant to the person being written about. I plan on making that clarification in an update to the design of the feature so people are aware of this. After thinking about the date structure further I will leave it as is since if I change it I would be getting messages about the format coming from Americans. If you become a member you will be able to edit the article manually after it is created via the Story Creator tool so you can then change the date format as you wish. You can also add take away and edit all the other aspects to the article in this manner as well. The way I envision the use of the site is this the Story Creator feature is used to get a page created by members and nonmembers alike and then members including the person that created the page if they joined as a member can edit and add as they wish. So it may be better as looking at the Story Creator tool as a way to create the first draft of a story page and not thinking that once it is created it couldnt be changed or edited later. I also think that the ability to edit after the creation of the article should resolve the name issue since you can put down nicknames of the person in the page. I hope this helps and I really appreciate your feedbackits helping me develop my refinements to the site as well as the messaging I use to communicate about it.,Genealogy,d6hc1a9,1,t5_2qmdf

10017122,0,t3_5j3npo,Honestly before you start with an ancestry subscription start writing down what you know and how you know it.So write down your name...your birth date...where you were born...your parents names. Your source is your birth certificate.Next...your parents. Your mothers name...date and place of birth. Does she have her birth certificate? If not order it.  You say you dont speak to your paternal side...does that include your father? If it does do you have any information about him? Name age place born etc. Do you have enough information to order his birth certificate?  If your parents were married do you have a copy of their marriage license and certificate?Using the information from your parents birth certificates move back to their parents. As you get further back you will eventually not be able to use birth certificates since most states only implemented state registration around the turn of the century early s.  But you can start using census records. The most recent census available is . From  the census did list the family relationships to the head of house so that is helpful in determining relationships.Also ancestry is great but why dont you start with the free site familysearch.org?Finally...do not blindly trust trees that other people post on ancestry...or any site. They are often WRONG. Keep in mind that in many places you might have multiple people in the same family with the same name. So you might have person A named John Smith. Who also has a father named John Smith. And person A also has a son named John Smith. And then there is also a cousin named John Smith. etc. etc. etc.  There are many people out there who see a name that matches their person and doesnt investigate any further and just says...that must be my John Smith...when it really is not.,Genealogy,dbd9cpx,5,t5_2qmdf

10840365,0,t3_5uzfn6,Something I suggest look for websites on rootsweb or otherwise with your family members included. I have had two main successes with this method I actually only tried contacting two people so far lol. Rootsweb websites almost always have contact information. One of my successes was somebody I contacted that hadnt updated their website since . This was a person I later found out was something like a th cousin. I was looking for information on an old line of my family that I was missing information for. They ended up sending me a hundred page thoroughly researched and cited book that she had received from a distant cousin of hers. I also recommend searching for blogs about your ancestry. I received many photos from a distant cousin related by my rd great grandparents because she posted about her genealogical findings to a blog. She in turn connected me to more people. If you cant find any blogs or websites then the moment you find any sort of photo of any ancestor do a reverse image search on it using google images or  . Or both. If its posted anywhere else on the internet you can most likely find it to find more likeminded relatives who may have information.
