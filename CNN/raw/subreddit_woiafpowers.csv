2816469,0,t3_2sbx6j,Application FairmarketOrkmontThe Iron Islands have always been my favorite of the seven kingdoms Im just in love with the characters they produce and am really excited at the chance to make my own as their leader. The concept of ironborn rule in the Riverlands is so intriguing to me and Id love to see it go not as terribly as it did in the true canon. Im glad this game is set preHarren the Black and preHarrenhal because I do not intend for House Hoare to go the same route. The challenge of gaining the River lords trust and trying to unite the two kingdoms is so exciting to me and I think itll make for some very rich role playing.My hypothetical leader of House Hoare would be a devout follower of the Drowned God unlike the canonical Hoares who intermarried with followers of the Seven. However he would be an older and wiser ironmen who is still physically quite large strong and intimidating but more liberal in his beliefs and acceptingunderstanding of the traditions of the various cultures of the world. He stays true to his culture but is not so radical as to mindlessly murder those who disagree with him as many ironborn do.I think a more levelheaded Ironborn leader such as this would have a better chance of establishing a healthy rule of the Iron Islands  Riverlands than the canonical Hoares did.I think being a RPG gamer of my experience I am wellequipped to take control of any house in this game regardless of their power. The issue is availability which I seem to have plenty of so I am confident in claiming a more significant house.Like many people my age Im well versed in video games of most types especially RPGs so no need to get into my experience with that type of stuff. Im also a huge fan and constant player of strategy board games from Settlers of Catan to the official A Game of Thrones board game so Im extremely familiar with tactical mechanics in strategy games.Im also not new to roleplaying. I have a friend who is quite the accomplished Dungeon Master and our group of friends has been through our fair share of lengthy DnD campaignsMore relevantly Im a player over at riceandfirepowers my first game of this type. I controlled Sunspear ac to start and participated in sparked a civil war stardprince. After I lost and my character died I claimed Moat Cailin where I play pretty casually. That is what brings me here  I seek a more serious and structured format of play.uadamhernandez Ice and Fire Powers highlights Prince Hieronymous Biography insunspear Summit between rival leaders tweenprincenymerosandlady Antwoord Naharis arrival sandacontingentof  Declaration of Independence domofetruriadeclaresits Minor RP eting Desperate Etruria acallforjusticetothe The Bastard Prince rdprince House Jermaine Lore theweircraftSo theres my nerd resume.

2826188,0,t3_2sgmg0,Edit The people of the Reach have convinced me to change.. Goldengrove  . Old Wyk  . Castamere. The Crag. YronwoodWhy did you choose these claims?    I have put Goldengrove first as I have been well convinced by other Reach claiments. There is a nice array of veterans and well respectable people claiming there. Plus flowers.  I put Old Wyk second due to Tydides being King there. Ive had good experiences with him and they seem friendly as well.  The last three choices were due to interest in the canon as well as previous experience.  Why do you think you should get one of these houses?  As said in my King application I have RP experience up with and surpassing many people joining.  Id like to think Ive left a good impression on other people and that I have a good understanding of the canon surrounding most of my choices.   Extra  My activity fluctuates according to other events in the world. A lot of what I do is also behind the scenes in IRC PMs and private subreddits then I make something according to that.  ,woiafpowers,cnpbzbq,3,t5_34bwk

I have friends countrymen in these lands who will not suffer their lands being pissed upon by Lannisters and Reynes. You would be so bold to interrupt a period of peace?He spat at the ground.I will not see anymore blood shed. I will not release the Ironborn to you. I will not see my men die before you.

2919460,0,t1_cnzs8l5,Horas swore fealty to houses Blackwood and Durrandon and returned to the castle of Fairmarket to collect his belongings. As his men took down the banners of House Frey from the walls of Fairmarket he visited King Harwyns solar there was one last thing he needed to collect. As he entered the room his gaze fell upon the iron crown that sat on King Harwyns desk right where he left it. He plucked it off the table and turned it over in his hands one last time the crown was not a thing of beauty but it had a feeling of power to it a feeling of power that Horas had thirsted for his entire life and wearing the crown for that short few months had only made his thirst for power stronger. As Horas was about to leave the room a sly smile on appeared on his face. With a flick of his wrist he tossed the crown onto a pile of headless Ironborn corpses that sat just outside of the solar. With that he turned and walked down the hall the laughter of his the guards that had seen what hed done rang in his ears. ,woiafpowers,cnzy9co,1,t5_34bwk

3168525,0,t3_2wek3i,The White Wolf watched the duel from a distance with great interest. He was panting beneath his helmet from the exertion of the battle. His arms were nearly numb from the blows he had dealt and received. His armour was dented and scuffed and caked with gore. His white wolfhead helmet was streaked with runnels and splatters of blood.His horse Hilde had taken an arrow in the flank and she sucked the hot air loudly. Ben patted her on the neck with a gauntleted hand comforting her. She had done well as always.Bracken had dismounted to fight the enemy leader on foot and advanced with his battleaxe raised. Ben raised an eyebrow quizzically surprised by the foolishness of the man who had come up with such a lucid battle strategy. Then the duel began. Boros was quickand seemingly skilled. But he wasted too much time with taunts and high talk. He suffered several wounds for his hubris.Then the fool decided to strip himself throwing his armour and shield aside and licking the blade of his axe. It was supposed to be intimidating Ben assumed but it had a nearly opposite effect. The soldiers who watched only looked on with disgust and confusion not admiration. This madman is supposed to be our Captain? He cant even control his own behavior let alone a companys.The fool charged the enemy and in a series of blows felled the already crippled commander. What he did next sent a wave of disgust across the field of observers.Boros knelt picked up a severed armand held it over his upturned face. With a look of pleasure bordering on ecstasy squeezed the blood from it into his open mouth.Ben had seen and done much in his days as a raider and soldier but never had he seen such preposterous savagery. This mannothis animal had displayed a lack of humanity that was outofplace even in the maelstrom of combat. Honourless scum he thought noting the look of ignorant arrogant pride on the Brackens bloody face. He would remember that madmans grin for a long time. Dark days will come upon us if that fool is left with command.The White Wolf wheeled his horseand rode back toward the camp.,woiafpowers,coqezt3,2,t5_34bwk

His eyes wandered across the city looking at the tall buildings and the dark alleys as well Lannisport felt familiar but he knew the Free Cities and the Slavers Bay would feel strange and odd so many different cultures and different ways. He had read some books to prepare himself for the journey and he had practised his rusted Valyrian after long years of not speaking it.He looked down to the sailors at the docks and the people loading his newly bought ship it was a small war galley made of a dark wood though most of the hull was painted in a crimson paint. The figurehead was a smiling lion made of iron with eyes of fake red gemstones but the ship was too far for the details to be seen. It had but two masts sporting golden sails and a small red flag most likely emblazoned with the sigil of House Lannister. Brightroar was written in golden letters on the sides of the ship.After a moment of consideration he looked over his shoulder to his cousin shrugging his shoulders once more. He flashed his usual bright charming smirk. Do I need a reason to see my darling cousin? You have been secluded ever since... He silenced himself his eyebrows furrowing and his smile fainting. Ever since the squids... Well you know... You have family to rely on. He did not want her to know about his voyage nor did he want to tell her about the ship. He knew she still mourned the death of her family and so did Jason he missed his brother and his father dearly.,woiafpowers,crkwag9,2,t5_34bwk
