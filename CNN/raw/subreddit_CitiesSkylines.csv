2490948,0,t3_2o1g64,Im pretty sure Ive read that this game is single player only. Are there plans for any multiplayer components or game play? I imagine most people would prefer this game to be completely single player I have a few friends that play sim cities though and it would be neat to somehow play together...

2492142,0,t1_cmju3ed,OK. I skimmed through and what you provided was very helpful.  Two more specific questions after reading  will there be movable bridges  will the player need to create railyards  I noticed it seems all cargo related train traffic is just handled from the mainline.  In reality this would cause major issues with traffic on the tracks...but I can see how the game may have to treat it in a simpler manner.,CitiesSkylines,cmjuzz8,5,t5_331rj
2529767,0,t1_cmm7gft,Well yes and no. We have decided to decrease the size of some buildings and utilities for gameplay purposes for examples power plants farms and airports. This is because they would take such an insane amount of land normally that it didnt make sense from a normal players perspective.Yet we have heard our community ask for all of these things to become larger and I am sure that either we will decide to act upon this feedback post release or some brave modder or team will take it upon themselves to create alternate assetsets for these buildings.Nevertheless we aspire to be a city builder that listens to our players so please raise your voice on this topic and add to the flood of feedback. Its appreciated and helps us decide what to do after we have released the game.,CitiesSkylines,cmorz2k,15,t5_331rj

3260298,0,t1_cozwnd5,You should be able to both replace and add to the existing buildings although adding to the existing buildings will of course add also the the memory requirements so adding hundreds of buildings can lead to slow downs and longer loading times since there is more stuff to load with new models and textures and so on.You can create both zoned and ploppables the most important differences being the sizes zoned are from x cell to x cells and ploppables have their own restrictions.It took me a few evenings to model and texture the building although I wasnt working on it all the time when I was in the process of modeling and painting the textures. The modeling time depends more on the complexity of the structure rather than whether the building is a small detached house or a large story apartment building.,CitiesSkylines,cozxw3x,3,t5_331rj

3278132,0,t3_2xo2vz,A previous comment regarding rush hour I postedYeah with Colossal Orders last game Cities in Motion  it simulates day night cycles and cims would behave accordingly. This means you should get peak traffic flow when you would expect it.You would expect the morning rush then another smaller peak at mid day then another rush after usual work hours. CiMs day night cycle is much longer that the passing of days in Cities Skylines and even taking that into account I found that in CiM traffic tended to build up all day eventually dying out some time around midnight.There is however the ability to create custom rule sets in which you could amongst other things alter the rate at which time passes. This allowed the simulation the necessary time for traffic to peak and trough at multiple points during the day night cycle.This would result in a single day night cycle taking the best part of an hour to pass.Balancing this with other aspects of the game is not an easy feat. A substantial bank loan taken to build a new network connection could take four in game weeks to pay off or  ingame days even giving a modest  mins for the day night cycle thats  minutes . hours.OK so you balance the economy to fit around the new pacing... now you will end up rebalancing the entire game.Changing these aspects of CiM also tends to demand more from your system so you would have to raise the minimum specs for the game.Furthermore does this more realistic pacing actually make for a more fun game? There are rule sets that do this available on the CiM Steam workshop. Ive tried a few of them also tried doing my own and Ive felt like none get the balance quite right and Im never sure if they bring me more enjoyment from the game.,CitiesSkylines,cp1xm56,2,t5_331rj

3312560,0,t1_cp5tr9p,When you have an onramp so close before an offramp it creates a slowdown because cars entering will merge further in the hwy and backup the cars already in the roundabout. Also idk how useful a  lane roundabout is as cars will very very rarely use the innermost lane. From what Ive seen the right lane becomes a dedicated turning lane for AI so if a car is not turning at the next intersection it will move inward  lane regardless of what the road arrow says. I dont think the inner loop is necessary. Cars exiting the NS hwy have to slow down to make those sharp turns ,CitiesSkylines,cp5uyn3,3,t5_331rj

Perhaps in the code a right junction like in the image creates a right only lane rather than straight amp right.Re lane   in a perfect world theres no reason to use lane  unless there is a lane.  The reason for this is In no traffic  all cars are driving at the same speed so no overtaking In traffic  while the individual would benefit their merging later would slow the overall flow of traffic leading to the same length of queue so if youre simulated traffic as a whole it makes sense for this behaviour to not exist although it might be nice to have for immersion.,CitiesSkylines,cp66pat,1,t5_331rj

Secondly I think I read somewhere that in .. the ground pollution is still purple and in .. that got fixed. I still have the purple.

3403165,0,t3_2z6mis,I also had a difficult time raising population when my residential commercial and industrial needs met an equilibrium. The best way I found is to make a lot of jobs available. Even though in a the bottom of your screen industry may not be needed add more industry zones this will cause an influx in the number of jobs available and cause the demand for workers causing population need to go up. Once you have offices unlocked I recommend getting rid of industry offices are much safer and do not cause pollution. Dont forget to edit pollices for districts with offices to maximize profits. Offices fill the need for industry! However with offices comes a higher need for educated workers and will require more schoolsuniversities. Also once you have high density residential unlocked it will allow more people to live in small areas boosting population. Hope this helped!,CitiesSkylines,cpg6pt6,2,t5_331rj

This eliminates intersections and makes them work like the highway system where the roundabout has right of way.This is really useful when building residential areas.

3424016,0,t3_2zfxz1,My recommendation  Play with the roads coming off of the circle.  Since we cant modify the turn lanes ourselves yet you have to try and get it to behave how you want by using different road types.  If you have highways sections coming off of the circle and two lane one ways coming in it works very well as the highway forces the right most lanes to be right turn only.  Since they look so far ahead you can even get people using the fifth lane in assuming its a  way traffic circle.  Otherwise its no better using a  lane one way than a  lane.,CitiesSkylines,cpika0y,1,t5_331rj

A whole lot of people ended up not getting their item which is obviously a bad thing. It was intended to be a onetime exclusive just like preorder items or stuff wed give away at conventions. Alas with the extra struggle that appeared with the missing keys we decided this shouldnt be the case.So were giving it to everyone.Well update both the standard and deluxe versions to include this item by default. As were working with the Steam backend it might take a little while for it to update but expect it to pop up ingame under parks some time today.Please note that were not planning to make a habit out of giving away promo items to everyone.

If your unemployment is high do not build more commercial or industry even if the RCI demand chart wants it!! You will only make it worse. Instead build residential even though it might take a while to fill eventually you will have enough workers. Workers who are very educated will take industry jobs but only as a last resort so you have to force them to by giving it time.

3457448,0,t1_cpmb5ei,You can use a lane oneway on a highway if you are absolutely sure the traffic is going to split evenly into a Tjunction or an intersection after that.    I would personally use the highway as far as possible and then go to a lane oneway that splits into three x lane roads all spreading into three different directions. Then it is easy to downscale those roads to lane twoway roads or back up to laneslane twoways....or a highway.    This is what Ive found works best for my city at least.

3461963,0,t3_2zwal3,Ive encountered this as well. I believe the game is not telling you that your city needs more residential zoning or that your cims are to educated or something. As far as I can tell there are enough workers but the offices are to far away from the houses. Try improving our infrastructure build more motorways and add public transport. Also make sure that commercial and housing zones are not to far apart. I tend to zone islands of housing areas in my commercial areas. I then add public transport and try to connect the whole thing to a highway. Normally that solves my problem. Thats why I believe its not the number of workers in your city but merely that they cant reach their workplae easily enough.,CitiesSkylines,cpmw0bm,1,t5_331rj

3496807,0,t1_cpqredu,Oh my goodness. Im sorry I commented already on another reply of yours but I just had to comment again because youre claiming to have proven something that just isnt true and claim were all spreading misinformation when I dont think youre really informed that well yourself.Having more jobs than workers doesnt necessarily have to be destabilizing. All it does is cause pressure for wages to rise. If you look at a simple labor supply and demand model what youre saying is that if the quantity of labor supplied is less than the demand for labor meaning number of workers less than jobs this will suddenly make the economy a mess. But what youre not seeing is that the real equilibrium happens at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. If theres a labor shortage thats just a driving force for us to move up along the demand curve to the point of intersection of the two curves at a higher wage. Thus if firms cant find enough workers theyll increase wages as a way to attract the workers that are in the labor force to their firm. Increasing wages decreases their quantity demanded of labor since now labor is more expensive and were back at equilibrium not instability. More jobs than workers is a gold mine wages rising unemployment falling firms selling more because of the rises in income due to higher wages. Thats in fact a lot of the discussion going on right now about The Fed raising interest rates. We havent seen wages go up because firms havent felt the pressure to do so yet which shows a weakness still in our economy after the recession which caused a lot of people like in your city to move into jobs theyre overqualified for. Until the Fed sees wages rising they wont be too quick to move on interest rates. So really all youre showing is that CS follows basic simple intuition of economics. Not enough jobs for welleducated workers? After a while theyll go to factories. Not that everybody else is misinformed and PhD graduates are okay with their jobs making widgets in your factories.Another simple Econ  model. If we want to keep thinking of equilibrium and market clearing if your city has more jobs than employees thats simply an incentive for workers from outside the city to move in and work there if people see the US as the land of opportunity with endless jobs theyll all migrate there simple as that. So the market will eventually clear. Just no.EDIT Also I probably sound like this so sorry if Im coming across as preachy. Just...,CitiesSkylines,cpqv0mv,1,t5_331rj

3611659,0,t1_cq2x36y,I dont think so. BF and BF Mods needed dedicated privately hosted servers. There were DLC packages for BF and BF that were bought happily by everyone I know that was into battlefield at the time since these DLC would run on servers hosted by EA. If EA would keep ranked servers for their DLC and allow modding and unranked privately hosted servers for mods then their games would sell just as much and probably even more. The funny part is that BF didnt really have official mod tools they were created by the community members and were quite difficult to learn at first. BF had an official mod tool which was quite good but and we can see this today in the mods that are still played.I was a huge fan of the BF series but I cant be bothered with them right now since I lost interest after BF thinking they would stay true to the BF formula. Eversince they went to consoles the BF series has slowly deteriorated into something I cant support anymore. I honestly like playing ArmA more than I do BF at this point.BF has some really cool mods one of which is forgotten hope   a total conversion bringing BF to the WWII era. Their latest update was on th May .. Theyve brought the German US Canadian Italian and Britisch armies to the game complete with player characters vehicles and weapons and maps.just watch this  to see how epic this mod is.Then theres Battlefield sandbox mod theres project reality also one of my favorites and several others..

3620474,0,t3_31tydm,Well it doesnt look that bad. But a few possible tweaks.One of the queues at the exit is backing up onto the highway and the other isnt far off. Lengthening that exit slip will give space for traffic to queue without blocking the highway.You have two separate exit ramps  the ones with the queues  meeting into a single intersection. I believe they will take turns having green lights. Merging them together first then meeting the intersection will let a single green light phase serve both.In the city you have signalled intersections quite close together which will cause delays when the traffic gets heavier. You could try making some of your twolane roads oneway so that some intersections have both two lane roads going only out that will remove the lights. More drastically you could make some roads deadends but expected houses to be torn down and rebuilt so dont do it to all roads at once.,CitiesSkylines,cq4yln7,1,t5_331rj

3628784,0,t3_31uho6,In case youre wondering why you dont see this in real life the lane going from the East to the South suffers from an effect called reverse curving.  In short coming off the highway you turn right and start to decelerate. To make that turn at highway speeds the road rotates on its axis to the right.  At some point the turn becomes straight and rotates back to a neutral axis.  From here it goes  in the opposite direction turning left and rotating to the left on its axis.  This hard change back and forth leads to a bunch of vehicle control issues.,CitiesSkylines,cq5wqob,2,t5_331rj

3645105,0,t3_324e8b,Ok here we go  CS is by far the better city builder.  Its really the true successor to SimCity. CS has much better performance. CS has the huge workshop which allows you to easily expand the game. CS has a better UI that doesnt get in the way and while subjective feels simpler and more modern.  With a simple mod CS has nearly the same city footprint km vs km. CS has a more detailed and realistic simulation.At its heart I would say that CS is a true city buildingsimulation game whereas XXL is simply a city design workshop.  Theres not a huge challenge managing large cities in XXL while Ive found that while not overwhelmingly difficult in CS either you do have to think a little and do more critically.If anything after  titles Monte CristoFocus Home has failed to deliver a true king in the citymaking genre.  XXL is simply not a worthy successor.  CS on the other hand is a great game with a great community and so far great developer response.  You should get CS to if just to support CO and help move the citygenre to the next level.  I can only imagine what COs next title could look like.  And thats good for all citybuilder fans! ,CitiesSkylines,cq7romd,1,t5_331rj

Note that the three train stations are built in loop formation off of the main highway and the internal station is another small loop off the same highway. This allows trucks that are moving cargo between the internal and external station to remain in that loop without impacting local traffic. Works great!,CitiesSkylines,cq7uo9w,1,t5_331rj

3684653,0,t3_32k682,I made a writeup dealing with this. Basically for whatever reason trains have a maximum rate that they can enterexit the map at. Perhaps this is to simulate inefficiencies in the external rail network.If you have passenger and cargo train station hooked directly up to the regional network you might notice that a large number of the trains entering and exiting the map are below  full. This means that you rail network isnt being used efficiently. This isnt a problem if you have light rail traffic but can become a major problem as your rail traffic gets heavier. Separating your cargo and passenger traffic as well as separating local and regional traffic encourages trains to be utilized more meaning that they will be filled to a higher percentage before departing the station.Before localregional separation of my cargo lines my trains would average  full. Now they average  full which is a far better utilization and frees up congestion.,CitiesSkylines,cqc9wlc,2,t5_331rj

Our Skyline is a monument to the collective achievement of humanity. It is a monument to science engineering and architecture which our society does mostly still hold close as valuable. And I think in that respect it absolutely passes the Is it something meaningful test he put to things. Nobody even knows what companies are in most of the buildings  we just know that they are incredible and beautiful feats of human accomplishment. And I think that they are way cooler than having a church spire be the center of town or something. Aspiring to be awesome humans is much more interesting that aspiring to be closer to God IMO.

To select it I think I tried creating a stop at the same place or create a line around and adjusting the line to create a stop or something like that. It involved being able to trick the line editor to select that stop as part of the current line being created. Im sorry I cant be more specific.

It is very easy to ignore the noise pollution because the ground value is high anyway.And what is the point of parking cars? Is there any disadvantage if there is no parking space?nuclear reactors are have a very low pollution when it is working normally but the pollution caused of construction maintenance and the deconstruction are extremely high aside from the very low acceptability of those buildings from a great part of the population.There should be some kind of punishing for building them like in real live.I give you an other example a wind turbine is huge if you compare this to a nuclear reactor. it has a giant area of noise pollution an a very low power output. yeah thy have a very low power output and they may have some kind of heavy noise pollution. i think they missed a few things in here.You skipped the farming sector.

Increasing a service will improve land values making people move in. Decreasing will do the opposite.

Purely aesthetic. They do not function. They simply make nice screenshots.If Cims have reasons to stop at road stop filling gas getting refreshments long drive break or visit the stadium sports team scheduled concert or use car parks mandatory parking where cars must be persistent and cant disappear. Things like that is what I mean by Cim simulation.Then theres the passage and simulation of time and how it relates to what Cims do at specific times of the days. Thats just another dimension and a Pandonas box of game design problems that can be discussed at much greater length.Anyway the game is very good but on a very superficial level now. Ive made realistic infrastructure like these too. Made my large space stations and industries for which my city is recognised for a forest area in the hills for Cims to go trekking and hiking a big University campus with its sports facilities parks plazas and malls for the University students to decompress between their lectures and assignments.All of those have been purely imagination.

All you do is fill in the area you designed with the x or x x x and x brushes.For the smooth edges along roadsrails you can use the circular x brush.

4149557,0,t3_388xar,I think the first step is to stop gauging your city with the people that might be sharing it here or on Steam.  Im not saying not to enjoy other peoples creations but dont get discouraged when you see someone that has an amazing layout and spent a lot of time in their city because one screen shot probably doesnt do the justice it took to create it  hours upon hours of tweaking and refinement.I doubt anyone here who is serious about this game has ever looked at some of their first cities or even their more recent ones after hours of playing and think theyre perfect  thats inherently part of the pyschological nature of this game I think.  The beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and a lot of artists  and in our case city building artists  never are satisfied with their work and always feel it can be improved in one way or the other.Maybe try to set some small goals?  Dont shoot for this  tile urban sprawl that encompasses k cims.  Maybe your first step is refining a basic style and pattern that you like personally.  Start by making a small neighborhood  a complete one  in that you spend a lot of time on that neighborhood to get a strategy and overall style down.Do you like to use one ways?  Do you like certain design aspects like round abouts?  Do you like grids?  Do you like rural scenes or more densely populated metrosuburban looks?  Part of your problem is there may be no strategy that you have to mold your city after.  The thing with these games is they mostly leave it up to the user to create their own  they do not define these for you.My advice to sum this novel of a comment is to step back for a minute and think smaller and in building blocks.  Refine your strategy and style for neighborhoods and then build out that way.  Take it slow.  Rome wasnt built in a day as they say  and neither should your city.  I can sometimes spend an entire night making a fucking onoff ramp for an industrial connection.  But I want to make it functional and pretty and somewhat realistic as part of my as I said above defined strategies when I build my city.I often times will go to Google maps and search ideas and cool nifty areas.  Google some design ideas that you like in real life and implement them in game.  If you are struggling with creating your own creative juices  use a mold and template on a real life area that you can use to get started.  Then after you are comfortable with that take off and make it completely your own.For instance heres a post I did a while back that showed a very interesting housing development.,CitiesSkylines,crt9ijl,20,t5_331rj

4308028,0,t1_csb800j,That is the key here zoning slow. The reason why industrial always goes first is because it is the last job a cim will pick up. Limiting education is only shooting yourself in the foot. If you see not enough workers simply look at the household ratio. Has everyone moved in yet? you may have zoned and buildings appeared for residents to meet demand but most of the households may have not even moved in yet. If there are barely any households left to move in just try zoning more residential until your workforce catches up. You may have too many seniors which is why there are no workers and no demand for residential.I see that you kept zoning for commercial which could also explain it. Instead of bringing a workforce in to work industrial you are giving them a preference to work commercial instead of industry. And if you get really desperate and in need of workers bad just bulldoze residential buildings with mainly seniors to kick out the lazy bums.,CitiesSkylines,csb8o07,1,t5_331rj

4316349,0,t1_csc289y,No the deaths always happen and you dont see them.  The first grey skull icon does not appear with the death it only appears after the hearse is late.  Watch a hearse in the Deathcare overview  theyre purple and easy to see.  They make lots of stops usually where there is no icon.  Thats because they are getting to most corpses within a time limit dont know what the threshold is.So if you see lots of skulls its not that theres suddenly lots of death although that might be a cause too its that theres suddenly a lot of late hearses.  And then you get red skulls because the hearses are still delayed.  And then abandonment....So what suddenly made lots of delayed hearses?  Is it a sudden surge in deaths which you are ruling out or is it actually a substantial slowdown in traffic.

4628865,0,t1_ctdzg1h,D talking of dark secrets... I think I have a few too...First the industry parks doesnt have very good road planning for logistics. Quite a lot of traffic jams along the industry  port industry  highway routes. There is one roundabout especially serious with this type of jams let me get a screenie when Im back from workThe jam was there also for downtown around the highway intersections what I did at that time was to divert the traffic with one way roads. Now it has indeed better traffic but the downtown residents now complain that they dont have enough garbage trucks visiting. Thats why there is a lot of garbage bin icons in the second last picture of the album. Im rather happy with earlier districts... Just that it becomes hard to fit bigger parksunique buildings in with the distorted grid built along the river valley. Park systempark boulevards is something I have overlooked in this city and I will definitely try when I start afresh. The reason Im going to start new city is not only that I wanted to try something new but that it seems i have used far too much assets that it takes quite long time to load and crashes quite a lot  which often caught me when I have built a big stretch without saving. So I am going to axe quite a lot of custom assets when Im done with this save. Though I love this city still and I guess I will still tinker it quite a lot.Oh yes the airport  it was in a relatively remote area when I built it and I had considered to build the peripherals to make it more realistic.

Its about carving your own digital piece of the world and having satisfaction in creating something.  Most people cant even come close to the creativity you needed to show in your screenshots.This game can be about a lot of things but in my opinion the priorities are about personal satisfaction growing your skills through your creativity and designing outlets.

4766776,0,t1_ctv9w1w,When it comes to other expansions can you add an opposite meta game that dynamically forms as you build your city? Is something like that on the table or do the minimum specs kinda destroy that possibility?Like in Simcity  your city specialized depending on what you funded and where you were opposed to following a list. It was one of the crowning achievements of Simcity  that no one else seems to do.A water locked city unlocks the water based buildings. An artsy city gets murals everywhere and art houses. A smart city gets labs and all the out there stuff that super science brings.So what I am asking is a dynamic culture that forms in the city depending on how you run it opposed to you plopping down buildings to check the list to unlock a mega building. Potentially where portions of the city form their own micro cultures.an expanded crime system car chases and other events that happen and form within a city would also add a lot to the life of the city. A lot like the gang system in Prison architect but on a city level. Gives something the news to cover as well because once you get on your feet the news serves zero purpose because all it really does is say if you got low power water or toxic land.and as a side note as everyone else has said when going into the future you could easily steal the crown for the entire market of starving fans and get all the money. You already took Simcity and EA down a peg you can make the games everyone asks for but no one delivers.Games in the vein of Theme hospital evil genius Capitalism II Zoo Tycoon or even another game like Jurassic Park Operation Genesis can be things you can bring up.Hell I am amazed Paradox hasnt made an economic simulator like Capitalism II where you start a company and try to pry your way into the many industries the game has to offer.

You can overflow any program if you make changes that circumvent limits on the number of elements in a particular system without making sure the rest of the program is capable of handling it.Im not sure what you think the Unity engine has to do with this. Do you think all the government UI all of the algorithms for traffic population growth demand etc are just part of the Unity engine? Were talking about object limits not just polygon limits.Ninja Edit Someone above just linked this comment from a dev.

5186932,0,t3_3m1qvy, Id say its quite noob friendly. It takes you by the hand at the beginning and lets you unlock buildings in a nice progression but be careful you dont start with enough money to build a metropolis right at the start. Also the game is considered fairly easy going. You wont see a GAME OVER screen just because you forgot to place a police station or something small like that. Just watch your water and sewage and youll be fine basically. The tricky part for most people seems to be the traffic. A few people complain that its broken or not quite realistic enough. But I think that its the best simulation out there and that you just have to play around it. Travel routes are calculated at the beginning and thus you shouldnt expect people overtaking or finding alternate routes when things clog up.  Id reccomend not using any guides and explore a bit for yourself first. Its a very creative type of game as opposed to goal oriented so not knowing every step of the way from the beginning might just give you a better experience.  I find that mods contribute in a good way. Ive played a lot of vanilla and lately Ive used a lot of mods mainly assets. The biggest strenght of CS is that its a good core game that with the help of modders lets you tailor the experience to your liking. So if you want to minmax theres room for it you can focus on transport aesthetics European American. ,CitiesSkylines,cvb7rn6,3,t5_331rj

5340474,0,t1_cvu9gvk,I mean specifically the cargo freight terminal train station. The building has  invisible lanes called Cargo Lanes in the games code that are basically the driveway. The distance between where the car spawns in the bays to the curbside is a specific road type that has the exact same stats as your basic roads  lane each way max speed . It doesnt matter if you connect a basic road  lane road ramp or highway to a cargo terminal. Traffic will always travel at a max speed of  pulling into and out of the bay. That is always the bottleneck no matter how you design your roads. Cramming a highways volume of traffic through a basic  lane road just doesnt work. Trains can pull in faster with a larger load than the amount of trucks that can cross this distance in the same period of time. This causes trucks to backlog and queue up in the terminal without restriction. Given enough time of  load backtoback inbound trains the backlog gets to be great enough that a building will get abandoned before its delivery ever has the opportunity to get to the front of the queue and spawn.TLDR Cargo train stations accept goods from rail faster than they can put them on the road. This difference can grow to the point where buildings get abandoned before their deliveries can get on the road.,CitiesSkylines,cvuaz07,3,t5_331rj

5361208,0,t3_3og2d9,What I miss the most is an option to use district policies or some other emchanism to turn off traffic lights in any region for the night when the traffic is lower.Another thing is that it feels strange that police are NOT using bike lanes for patrols and no not driving cars on these but sending out bike patrols directly. That should totally be a thing! I tend to build my road systems in a tree structure so it gets from local to regional roads and from regional to highways but betweek all these I love to build a massive network of cycling paths and walkways. Having police patrolls on bikes is something I expect to happen there but its not a thing.Fire trucks and other emergency vehicles still stand in traffic and obey traffic lights! In trafficheavy areas its just a recipe for everything in the area burning down to the ground!Crime system is still pretty shallow. After You plop down a prison its just as before with slight fluctuation due to daynight cycle. What Id love to see is adding more options. Abandoned buildngs affecting safety parks being more dangerous at night maybe crime scenes blocking streets with police cars just as fires block them with fire trucks.Multilane railway tracks are still not here! Trains already can go both ways on both tracks which is a great feature but it is still an extremely easy to clog system. For cars we can build smaller or larger streets but for trains we only have what we have. AD added SOME upgrades to the whole transportation system but at the same time this issue remains as it was. We do not have multi track stations despite we have multi strip airports!.Also ... just a small fature. Since we have an option to turn off snapping to grid can we also have do not connect option in both road and rail? So when I drag a new railway or a road it does not try to plug into any nearby object like a horny teenager. That would be SUPER helpful with building more compact infrastructure without having to use  mods to overcome the issue.And finally  building one metro station on top of another so there are two levels using the same enteranceexit but dot need to be parallel. ,CitiesSkylines,cvwye0u,2,t5_331rj

5648550,0,t1_cwx89e5,ah no I cant see it as its blocked by buildings.Im not sure why its leftmost lane then  it should be bunching them in the nd most left lane.The only other thing I can think of is that theyre all actually wanting to make the next left something that supports this is that your garbage trucks are going straight through. Since any intersection with more than one entrance that isnt a highway results in traffic lights theyll use whatever lane makes sense for their destinations. This is possible  and the problem is more that you have a traffic light. If youve used a mod to remove traffic lights you also need to use another mod to manually assign which lanes go to which so that all lanes can flow otherwise only one path can execute at a time.Finally the entire thing is compounded by the length of the short highway segment before the hex that segment is so short only  cars can be in the intersection per lane at a time so the people exiting the highway are unable to fully use the concrete there.I might have other ideas if I think harder. I like to pick apart game logic.IMO if you construct a bypass highway exit to where most of those cars are headed youll kill most of the traffic. I.e. from the same exit put an underground tunnel and pop it up in the hex where most of the traffic is.,CitiesSkylines,cwx9a2c,1,t5_331rj

Now what we would prefer is the AIs ability to adjust its route DURING its route however the amount of processing power that would take for each car on the road to continuously search for the fastest route taking in to consideration all the other traffic on the road is immense. There are give and takes when designing a game based on numerous factors. Thankfully we have a very supportive mod community that does its best to help alleviate the shortcomings of the traffic system. Is it a perfect solution? absolutely not but understanding how the system works goes a long way in eliminating the issues. I find just thinking about how I would go about driving the route helps me manage how I want my traffic to merge which streets need one ways etc. Always remember its just a game which provides enjoyment no need to get upset.,CitiesSkylines,cxwi8ys,3,t5_331rj

Abandoned buildings are replaced within a month or two and normally the low land value is of nearly no concern its a problem that if you ignore it it literally goes away. The only thing which isnt autoreplaced is burned down buildings but frankly you shouldnt have too many of those Fire Stations the big ones are pretty effective at dispatch so unless your city is gridlock central they should be able to put out virtually all fires.

6164840,0,t3_3zzhe6,yeah the skinny heavy roads arent great for buses because they dont have a pullout lane due to being so tiny. basically the skinny heavy roads are just squishing extra lanes into the regular  lane skinny roads. usually the space outside the travel lanes is used for parking or for decorations like trees or grass and the bus stops are stuck into these areas its similar for larger roads as well but those ones dont have any equivalents that squish in more lanes so you wont see the same issues so they dont block travel lanes. if you use the modded skinny heavy roads the buses just stop in the middle of a lane to board and thus block traffic in that lane! congratulations youve found another strange way the game indirectly simulates real life,CitiesSkylines,cyqdnn2,2,t5_331rj

I guess the problems are the same is in most of the world separating living space by building roads single crop forests and fields and an ever expanding population. In norway many of the red listed species have historically been living in agricultural landscapes that are now either monocultures or being paved over or split by highways.

6296616,0,t1_cz50234,Oh sorry by next I meant sometime after the recently announced awesome looking snow! I realise development is long term and dont expect a shift overnight.When it comes to specific suggestions my first thoughts were akin to what the other commenter has suggested  make the environment be tied much more closely to the simulation. Though when thinking down these lines I appreciate how difficult balancing player choices with simulation difficulty might be.After thinking about it some Im actually not  convinced anymore that the game is at actual fault but rather our expectations are. Anything I can suggest is way above and beyond what SCK SC had and yet I still feel those games were deeper and I absolutely cant categorically put my finger on why that is the case. Some possible reasons might be I remember struggling to plan aesthetics in earlier SC games you had to save build haphazardly and then redevelop as revenues went up  dont think I have ever really been constrained to do that in Skylines finished districts pretty much seem to stay finished. The gating of tech to years set the pacing of SC games and also helped force redevelopment  endgame in Skylines isnt about managing and redeveloping a city it happens so fast you still usually have most of the initial developing to go!I realise this is coming off as why Skylines isnt exactly like SC and I dont want you guys to clone SC. Its just the SC titles set the tone for genre and importantly the expected level of sandbox to game trade off. Whatever the underlying cause these sort of depth sentiments are shared by many on this sub perhaps a wider engagement with the community specifically on that issue would be a good way to really pick at why so many people tend to feel like it is too much sandbox. ,CitiesSkylines,cz5cr0r,1,t5_331rj

6312765,0,t1_cz6j1x8,Food is the  thing that other people rave about Singapore. Variety price and deliciousness are the best things there. And the biggest plus in comparison to some western countries shops are all open late until pm. This means I rarely cooked for myself when in Singapore getting takeaway from the food stalls was more delicious faster extremely convenient and at a good price to boot. Tip In Singapore the stall with the longest queue has the best food. Trust the locals.Tip . Note that in the neighboring country of Malaysia where Im from the halftruth is that the dirtier the place is the better the food is. The semilogic is that if its still in business while being so dirty it must be good. Oh and bring tummy tablets. Your stomachs might not be used to the food yet Tip In crowded food courts a packet of tissue paper placed on the table means that it is reserved. So you can find a empty table place your packet of tissue paper on it and then you can go around the stalls to get your food. This practice is called chope or choping for the verb.Tip Try Singapore Chilli Crab with a group when you can. If not for the actual crab just for the sauce  the fried buns. No Signboard Seafood actually gives you disposable bibs so you dont splash sauce on yourself. ,CitiesSkylines,cz76w3a,4,t5_331rj

Hence the smallest road is actually  lane slots  parking or bike or trees etc. and  travel which is why you can only choose one of them. You can also see that on bridges it goes down to  total lane slots I think it should be moddable maybe? but that may involve having to decrease travel lanes on the larger roads.

6521694,0,t1_cztse5l,Suggestion think more about what and how your community wants you to communicatie with them. After the AD announcement you didnt address the lingering problems sufficiently which made the announcement of more new paid stuff with Snowfall feel greedy. Then you release this which talks about more new stuff while everyone is still waiting to hear about what old stuff is being fixed. Perhaps not in a press release for the masses but at least in some thread on the forum for the hardcore fans to find. Even knowing that its being worked on but isnt going to make this particular patch would help. A post like yours helps but dont afraid to go deeper or be more directspecific. We can take a list of bugfixes or hear that a certain thing isnt coming within a month.I also have to disagree with your broad approach to DLC. I dont think its working. Almost none of the paid features DLC really work as well as the systems in the base game do. Snowfall seems to be more of the same even if it isnt its a shame that many think this. If you focus the DLC on one thing I think youll be able to do much greater things because everything can be interconnected. AD tried to do too many different things daynight cycle bikes prisons taxis tourism leisure but none really blew me and many others away aside from the graphical part with daynight. PDS focuses its DLC much more than you are doing and I think its paying off. This approach wont satisfy every single player but at least youll have more chance to put out DLC that completely satisfies at least a part of player base instead of feeling okay to most of the player base.,CitiesSkylines,cztw7pq,16,t5_331rj

6528250,0,t3_451pdn,LOL. You are using few mods with same functions at a time. Uninstall Tree Brush and Terraform Tool because you have Extra Landscaping Tools. EPTUI and TLM arent fully compatible i prefer TLM so i might uninstall EPTUI. Also you are using one of the most heavy options from T with TMIA you might use instead TMPETraffic Manager President Edition. Toggle Zoning is out of date better use new one Same for MultiTrack Station Enabler Better version I also dont think that Pause on load Better image overlay and One way street arrows are necessary. Also TLM got auto color function so you might uninstall Auto line color. Also I wouldnt use mods like simple clock because it wasnt update or at least rebuild for current version. Also i read some comments about OneWay Street Arrows that it may cause some nasty lags in a game that can be caused by custom shader issue but im lazy to test this.,CitiesSkylines,czukmz8,7,t5_331rj

6603703,0,t3_461exx,everything about this games traffic system is the reason I rarely play it anymore. Why the hell cant cars use all the lanes?  There is  point to using anything other than standard  lane and single lane  way roads.... anything higher will just cost you more money and not help the traffic. the inability to control how lights and stop signs appear at crossings is infuriating.  The fact that we as players have to fiddle with the intersections for hours to get them right is a huge time sink. Highway interchanges.  They suck.  Like really really suck.  Ive seen a few interesting ones but the transitions between certain road types makes all of them look retarded if you look close enough.  Id rather have no traffic in the game at all if its going to be this bad forever.  The fact that this comes from a company that has specialized in transportation systems in the past is quite frightening.,CitiesSkylines,d02dlsf,4,t5_331rj

I often have to make low density residential right beside high density residential some areas I dont want apartment towers shadowing the street below. The High Rise Ban district style doesnt seem to work that well as IIRC it seems to max building LEVEL out but not necessarily height. Just helps you more easily divide your residential areas from rural all low density suburbs low density  mediumhigh density more urbandowntown mostly mediumhigh density to metropolislarge city core stylealmost all high rise. I think Simcity  did it right by havinglow density single family homes villas often with yards.medium density lowmedium rise buildings condominium complexes tenements townhomes sidebysides etchigh density covers the tallest of the medium density buildings but includes high rise apartments.Simcity  had a medium density for all zones I believe. I dont think we need it in this game but it would help a lot unless they can fix the high rise ban district policy. If anyone finds that it works fine please let me know  maybe my assets are not complying which is why my highrise band only limits building level and not height.

On a sixlane oneway road the only option larger than a two lane oneway this looks pretty silly. It also creates lots of congestion. Also why no fourlane oneways?Laying water pipes is a nonstrategic time sink. Why cant roads carry water and power?I like using trains. Hoever sometimes if my city is sending out lots of trains they get backed up somewhere beyond my borders. Ive read people suspecting that its because of despawn time but I know Ive seen for myself that the triangular Y splits the game has for train tracks can create gridlock. If the stock maps had rail intersections with better spacing at least more than the length of a single train for all segments it would probably help a lot.UI feedback for if a dam would actually work.

The way that your roundabout works with the regular roads is that on coming to the roundabout intersection cars ON the roundabout will give way to those entering the roundabout.  This is NOT how a roundabout works IRL those ON the roundabout ALWAYS have priority over those wanting to enter.   Changing to all highway entrances  exits means that the priority is switched back to those ON the roundabout.  You can actually see it happening in your first screenshot.  The cars are stopping on each of the four normal road entryexit points whereas on the highway roads the cars are going over like normal.,CitiesSkylines,d18yan7,2,t5_331rj

I dammed it up early which barely any water flows out of it to make power so I shut it off.  But I put a bunch of out flow pipes on it the whole lake is brown now but the water level never rises at all!  As I originally thought the flow of poo into the lake would force some flow threw the dam to make power.  But it did not so I shut off the damn.    ampnbsp    Even after the patch I got rid of the dam raised the ground up and put Quay walls all the way around it and the water level still never rises.  ,CitiesSkylines,d1bu4lr,2,t5_331rj
7022786,0,t1_d1c6ebl,Edit Moving my comment here for better visibilityAll of what you wrote is correct and Im sure thats an answer to some question or remark but most certainly not to mine. This is not about limitations of simulations and definitely not about graphics. Sorry my post was not clear to you but I dont think I can rephrase it to make it any more obvious. The bugs occur independently of the graphics and even in very short distances as I have mentioned! so factors like processor resources and traffic recalculations are not the issue here. In fact particularly in a simulation of traffic good approximations should be more accurate the shorter the distances. This is something you learn in the first semester at the university the infamous traveling salesman problemTrust me I know a bit about heuristics cost functions complexity of multiagent systems etc. but while you are talking about suboptimal solutions Im talking about unintendederroneous results like the ones mentioned in my previous post. Producing a suboptimal result for a long route is a not a bug not recognizing that there is a direct connection between point A and point B and calculating a route that is  times longer is.     After rereading everything your point is more nuanced than I gave it credit for sorryIm glad you see the difference now.Let me just reiterate a few facts  This traffic bug has been around since the initial release.  The complexity of traffic calculations has been cited as one of the main reasons for the limit on agents simulated people and objects streets sections etc..  Recently the object limit could be improved by optimizing the code.It is therefore not unreasonable to conclude that the bugged traffic which leads to longer and therefore more complex routes represents a significant portion of the required calculations. Solving this would consequently not only solve many QoL issues services being more reliable etc. but furthermore free up much needed processor cycles for other tasks e.g. allowing another increase in objects.As good as the communication with the community is I find it extremely frustrating that issues like this are not taken seriously and being dismissed. I would be totally fine with them saying that they have looked into it and cant fix it in this version of the game . I know how difficult finding these kind of bugs is and I have the utmost respect for their development team. However ignoring this issue and trying to pass it off as a natural limitation of current PCs is simply dishonest which is totally unnecessary because they have our respect for having accomplished so much with such a small team Im sure the community would totally understand and still support them and who knows maybe even be better able to help in the investigation. My gut feeling suggests that for some reason the road sections are sometimes not registered correctly and therefore arent used when routes influence areas etc. are calculated. Obviously it is more complex than that since at least some traffic recognizes them but thats where Id start. Again as these are smart people Im sure its not a simple matter and Im probably totally off but one thing I am sure of  there is a bug somewhere and it is not a minor one.,CitiesSkylines,d1cdufj,2,t5_331rj

In vanilla my Intel Core i .GHz can easily maintain a solid fps up to around k. But with the settings I have set for TMPE I get about fps in the same city most of that due to the higher simulation accuracy. Decreasing the accuracy sees a tangible improvement in framerate. Keep in mind that I have Rush Hour enabled also so if you dont have that installed youll probably enjoy higher framerates and a happier CPU. EDIT Also want to add that my framerates vary depending on whether I have a bunch of hearses driving around picking up dead bodies. During death waves my framerates hover around fps but during more prosperous and happier times my framerate sticks around fps so YMMV. ,CitiesSkylines,d1uv6dg,4,t5_331rj

7640111,0,t1_d3ad99x,To clarify note everything I say applies specifically to the USStop signMust come to a complete stop before moving.  If multiple cars are approaching an intersection and they all have a stop sign ex whoever got there first goes through the intersection first.  If one of the cars does not have a stop sign they can go through the intersection without slowing down or stopping normally side streets would have a stop sign when approaching a busier street while cars on the busier street would not have a stop sign ex  In this case the car waiting at the stop sign would have to wait until nobody was coming to enter the intersection.Note that uncontrolled intersections where everyone can move freely through the intersection without stopping are dangerous and because of this intersections without stop signs or lights are very rare and only appear in intersections that will not get much traffic at all.Yield signsActs as a stop sign but you only need to stop if someone is coming from another direction.  Otherwise you can continue moving.  Yield signs are almost exclusively seen in merging lanes some roundabouts others use stop signs and dedicated right turn lanes that bypass traffic lights such as this light where people turning right can use one of the outer lanes and can ignore the light as long as nobody is coming from their left,CitiesSkylines,d3amzk4,1,t5_331rj

7924961,0,t3_4nt1tg,gt Do you make an unattractive block at the beginning to get over that initial funding a population hump?Yeah pretty much.  I dont go off somewhere else though.  Grids arent necessarily bad and I can easily build off what I start with and often rebuild my early areas especially industry as the city grows and its needs change.  Lots of real neighborhoods are made with straight blocky streets.Heres a shot of one of my cities when it was just starting outNew city!I should note that the shot is more focused on the landscape but you can see how the young city is little more than a square.  Thats another thing to keep mind screenshots dont tell the whole story!  You can get a great screenshot from a very simple basic city.  One of the things I love about this game.Heres that same city a little bit later seen from the other sidenotsonew CityThe starting area just blends in.

OP says hes from Dallas and theres at least three Dallas skyscrapers in the workshop.   And lots of other really tall buildings which are honestly kind of rare in Europe.

He should be happy that CS supports user content as well as it does.  Remember SC and all those dependencies you had for just about every building?

8657052,0,t3_4yfej3,It doesnt look too bad actually it could just be heavy traffic volume without congestion because you have the intersections well spaced out. First check out what kind of traffic youre having there is it industrial trucks or people commuting from residential to offices? For the latter you could put down a train or tram line between residential and highway running to the middleriverside of the office district and further that will take a lot of cars off the road. I wouldnt recommend adding highway exits to the residential district because then youre just moving the congestion somewhere else but the end of the highway could use a smarter grade separated no traffic lights junction.,CitiesSkylines,d6nqw43,2,t5_331rj

8699058,0,t3_4z36iy,In my opinion which is in fact based on others Ive heard the way water pipes work in this game is a bit stupid as in real life the pipes would just follow roads in most cases. They could just keep the pipes to link water treatment plants to the road network but incorporate pipes in roads by default with a cost increase. Now of course all roads dont have water pipes so they would have to make an option for that. And given the fact that the devs want to make the system simple well...

8716581,0,t1_d6uyhby,Well my graphics card isnt nearly top spec but from what people say that doesnt matter so much with this game.  I do know that playing with the settings doesnt change much so I leave all of them on high.  It uses every bit of my VRAM most of the time when Im playing but GPU load is usually only  percent or so.People say i doesnt help much.  I dont know for sure whether it does or not and am not saying it does but the game clearly uses them to some extent.  CPU load with a k city runs about  percent on normal speed.When I first load a city it loads about  GB into RAM but then it tapers off.  The other day I paused the game and did something else for a while and when I came back it wasnt even using  GB.  Then I resumed playing and it went up to maybe  GB.  Nobody will ever answer me when I ask if this is normal.  I wonder because it used to not do that.  Whatever it loaded into RAM when I started a game stayed there and at some point it started doing what it does now.If youve played the Sims  you probably know that even with brand new hardware it doesnt really improve the performance of that game.  I seem to remember the same with SC.  This game may be like that but time will tell.,CitiesSkylines,d6v7mck,1,t5_331rj

On the contrary they do it all the time. But the railroad is not supposed to be the line that weaves around the other routes.Railways moreso than roads pedestrian paths or any other transit route save for boats and ships must be flat. Locomotives are lousy at dealing with inclines on account of the weight theyre pulling and furthermore railway networks existed across the world before highways as we know them ever came into play. So the railway will take the path of least change in altitude and then other roads should come in weaving underoveraround the railways however you please.But basically those ramps shouldnt be cause for the railway to change elevation. The ramps should be elevated above the rails. ...I mean theyre coming down from an elevated section anyway.,CitiesSkylines,d73cr9g,3,t5_331rj

It took hundreds of hours to master each Simcity iteration. Expect the most recent one but it still was challenging for a long time.  All of them felt like a game.I have not played Cities XL for example but if you compare CS to Simcity. CS is less game more sandbox simulator. Simcities all have a tons of game in them. CS is more like landscape tool with  simulation. You can master it after building one test city. If I have heard correctly Cities XL series is even more about building pretty cities than CS. They have hardly any amount of simulation and thus even less game than CS. While CS has the most complex simulation of all city builders it still has less gameplay elements or should I say rules than Simcity series has.  ,CitiesSkylines,d81fyu6,1,t5_331rj

But with selecting to export to a city it may be a good idea to have a similar selection process to the loans  different prices for different amounts of garbage.I would fully support a waste DLC tbh my only concern is whether or not it can be a free DLC since an update this big might affect people that dont even have the DLC if that makes sense.

Google Earth is your new best friend.  Have a look around certain cities and get an idea for where they place their infrastructure.   Dont be afraid of the bulldozer or relocation button but its really trial and error.. . A couple of must have mods Some Id recommend. Lay some paths down after you lay a few roads but before you zone.  . I dont use canals much but Id try laying them first and then building around them.. Try using straight roads for guides in between and then bulldoze them.. The best tip I can give you is just build and bit by bit you will learn from your mistakes and get better.

10381632,0,t3_5myi1j,I would love to see a more complex social model unemployment land value incomepoverty crime education age illness and all those factors similarly related should really have a bigger influence.I would want to have a city that naturally goes through changes as manufacturing is replaced by high tech industry or offices many people lose their jobs. The working class parts of the city would decay under some specific circumstances crime might rise.And then when the rent is cheap artists and students might move into the old brick buildings at the old harbour. After a few years hip cafs and theatres follow.... until one day the city council decides to modernise the area and it becomes too expensive for the people who lived there or moved there before.This would add a whole new dimension to city planning how does my city treat the poor parts of the city? Do I try to educate them and police the areas? Do I try to attract jobs for lowskilled people? Do I put policies that cap the rent or do I provide social housing? Can students afford to live close to the university? Or do I provide special student tickets so that they can afford to use the metro to go to the uni? Do I encourage investment into decaying parts of town? Can I transform the old and now defunct cargo train station area into a hip place that keeps the old structures and might become a tourist attraction or do I just raze it?TLDR A more complex social model with some added tools for the mayor would be an awesome challenge!,CitiesSkylines,dcktlzq,3,t5_331rj

Some limitations for example you are based on a grid so no free drawn roads and there are less props still good mods though but in terms of the simulation...beats CS out of the water. Its engine is slightly different for example traffic is displayed cosmetically based on the number of cars trying to use that road ie a car you see isnt a sim that you can follow from home to work whereas in CS you actually see a sim trying to move somewhere.

Theres a specific point on the highway you can stick your hand out the window and feel the air turn from dry and hot to boreal and cool. I wasnt used to seeing pine trees. I didnt know what a forest smelled like. This screenshot is my memory of driving from Pinetop all the way up to Flagstaff with my mom.

Pay attention to which way the water is flowing so you dont pump unfiltered poop right back into homes.

11418145,0,t1_dfpow1x,I doubt that will happen to be honest. As far as I see it CO basically facilitates the technical infrastructure of new features and for the most part adds a relatively modest implementation of that feature as a starting point for the community to build on. From there on the mod community can take over enabling it to cherrypick what features it wants to change without having worry about grownup stuff like time management costbenefit analyses deadlines etc.  One may call it a lazy approach but to me it sounds like the most sensible and productive one. It isnt perfect by any means I think the range of the API what it can access proper tooling and documentation made available to the mod community are sorely lacking but that doesnt mean its bad either just look up a few vanilla screenshots from immediately after the games initial release and the difference genuinely is night and day one could easily be forgiven for not recognizing that a heavily modded version of CSL is actually the very same game...,CitiesSkylines,dfq8gyo,2,t5_331rj

11559980,0,t1_dg678dm,So Ive uploaded some photos of what I did on my OneDrive Took me a couple of hours. Ive amended a few things like the laneways cause there was no good way to put it in at the scale I was doing. I got rid of the eastwest streets that were cut off by the plazas mainly because in real life it just looks like parking lots plus that would dramatically change the scale I wanted to build in. However I made it so there was three major eastwest arterials and only two northsouth which are the two that border. Since the roads on the inside are smaller in real life than the bordering streets. With the most southern eastwest arterials I decided two oneways with trees in the middle since thats the closest I could get to the real thing plus limit cars choices forcing some extra ped use.This photo here is just one block on its own so you can see the detail.Looking back actually Im missing a whole row of city blocks with squares in them I was on a lot of strong pain meds when I did this so that probably didnt helpHopefully this gives you an idea of what you want to do or what can work the city only has a pop. so far of  and is running well... so far.Let me know what you think and what you end up doing.,CitiesSkylines,dg6btkg,1,t5_331rj

I had piece in oneway roads that were backwards and thats why my traffic wasnt flowing.I still havent figured out how to remove the underground ramp connectors.

11765866,0,t1_dgtnzir,I think you will. But I can see your concern. I think the Avenue is a specific road type you can place or upgrade to but I think the other road is just a normal one with a monorail built over it and the supports default to straddling it. I dont think it requires or automatically changes the road type. In the back of this image on the right you can see the Monorail crossing over roads and running parallel to them. Maybe there will be a snap to road option that will more or less change the road type in that mode but also allow you to build unsnapped if you disabled it? Thats how I would design it personally.We shall see but I can agree with your conern of limited road types with the Monorail is over head.Admittedly I never bought snow fall and I havent ever used tram roads so Im not familiar with how limiting that is. ,CitiesSkylines,dgtow2q,2,t5_331rj
11769511,0,t1_dgtwvky,You dont get parks before the first milestone. First pause the game. Then build dirt roads they are far cheaper. But dont build lots of roads at first maybe a total of u of road. Then make sure you have enough power and water and pipes covering all the roads. Make sure you pump station and sewage pump have power. Take power lines a small distance from the power source and start zoning there. This ensures your citizens get power as power jumps from building to building. It also reduces costs as you dont need lots of power lines everywhere. Zone and press start then wait. Dont zone everything at once do it slowly to match the demand at first. You will go into negative money just wait for people to move in. This is why it is important to have enough road you cant build more once you are negative so you need enough to zone until to get a surplus.,CitiesSkylines,dgu3sl2,2,t5_331rj
