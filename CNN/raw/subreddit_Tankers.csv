4034330,0,t3_33k9k0,When my Platoon got attached to a Infantry unit with Bradleys they had no idea that the average speed I liked to maneuver at over open ground was around  MPH while the Brads could only make around  MPH safely and risked tipping over if they turned too fast. They need to keep in mind I can and will move my platoon at significantly faster speeds than them.  Ill work with them to make sure we keep the tempo and not get too far ahead but overwhelming speed is my go to tactic.  Ill also need the fuel constantly available to maintain this.  But I do like having their Javelins and TOWs backing me up.,Tankers,crg57hf,1,t5_2wiy3
