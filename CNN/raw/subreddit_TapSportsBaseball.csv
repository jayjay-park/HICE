11778732,0,t3_67zdcs,it seems that glu is trying to get people to progress to avoid what happened in .  Depending how strong your team and your upgrades are you could face gold tier players.  I was doing  tournys yesterday im silver and i matched up with a diamond player twice.  If you want to stay in silver i suggest leaving your upgrades low and keeping a crappy team. I cant say for sure how they do the match ups though..  People farm gold by watching the free videos and resetting their ad id or hack for gold.   The highest scores you see are from people hacking. sprint event scores are high because people run huge streaks and spend a ton of gold,TapSportsBaseball,dgv5nhq,1,t5_34gb1
