6048511,0,t3_3xwtz3,i have quite literally open mocked phablets in the past particularly to my brother who got an iphone s. however i recently moved from a lumia  and  to the lg v and its amazing. i was concerned about the size but now i wouldnt want to go back. there is so much real estate and i dont find it all that much more difficult to navigate than a smaller phone. the benefits of screen size outweigh those difficulties anyway. the screen on this phone is insanely good.plus the phone is much more comfortable to hold than an iphone due to the grippy back and stainless steel rails.edit just to clarify this phone isnt any bigger than a s but has more screen real estate. it is bigger than a regular s but like i said i feel the smaller form factor phones really cramp you once ive moved to a phablet.,lgv10,cycgpzl,2,t5_3a5la

6693277,0,t3_47a7w4,In simple terms it produces the sound you hear from your earphonesheadphones.People who have higher end earphonesheadphones tend to carry around a music player DAP which is basically an iPod because usually mobile phones have limitations that do not allow them to take advantage of the higher end equipment they use. Lousy DAC which results in Music not sounding as good as it could Lack of power to amplify the sound signal to the higher end headphones which require more power to run.So the LGV with its high quality DAC amp Amp will actually allow people to use it as their music player just as most normal people do.TLDR LGV allows people who are fussy about how stuff sounds to use their mobile phone to listen to music.,lgv10,d0bn67i,3,t5_3a5la

First of all theyve already dropped display support for the second display and instead gone with a software fix that allows a display with in display feature on the LG G. Because of this Hardware eccentricity this device needs it completely separate build of Android for every flavor that the developer wishes to support. Second theres no following models in the V series no V as it were. The V was an interesting diversion and for a moment it captures the zeitgeist.

7135491,0,t3_4dai3x,Looking back now the only reason I purchased the V was at the time they were running a pretty awesome promotion on launch.  Without the promotion I would have just stuck with my original phone Nexus that being said.  The V will be a hit or miss device for you its got a pretty bad light bleed issue where the first and the gimmick second screen meet.  The battery life is subpar by todays standards.  While the quality of the camera is freaking awesome that was one of the main selling points of this device the device as a whole left a lot to be desired.  We dont get the monthly security updates at least on TMobile  I havent had an update from LG in the entire time Ive owned the device.  It seems they launched this phone and completely forgot about it while moving on to the compartmental G device.  If I had to chose between the x and the V Id opt for the X.

7373487,0,t3_4gc3ma,Well Bluetooth will do it. I dont know about too many other phones but I know my old IPhones Galaxy S Galaxy S and V all gotget hot if I use the cellular antenna wifi adapter screen or Bluetooth adapter for any extended period of time. Its pretty normal as far as I know. I also know most phones have some sort of temperature management system for example if the screen gets too hot it will automatically dim. I wouldnt worry too much just if youre using Bluetooth and your phones getting hot try to rest it on a conductive surface and not insulate it in your pocket. Worst case scenario is your phone will turn itself off.,lgv10,d2gbbpp,3,t5_3a5la

Out of nowhere it would tell me to turn left where there wasnt even a left near it would lost the signal many times well it wasnt accurate at all.On the V sometimes i even get surprised how things work. It never failed on anything its really fast doing everything. Ive got Google Maps Waze MeoDrive its like nDrive for specific from my country and Here maps. Although in general they probably do similar things i end up using Here maps everytime i need to get directions to somewhere for now its being perfect as it is.I dont know much more to tell you and as i said i cant compare much to different kinds of GPS but on the V it never told me to turn where i shouldnt and never lost the signal or anything similar so i guess its working as it should.,lgv10,d2z02xg,1,t5_3a5la

8026549,0,t1_d49sc24,Okay so after about a will heres my reviewThe case is huge but not in a bad way if you already have trouble fitting the phone in your pockets this wont be for you but otherwise its not any more noticeable then the otterbox is. I read reviews saying it is difficult to reach the back buttons but I think it kinda helps locate them a tiny bit. The first couple days I dont think my phone knew what was happening as the battery drain looked normal but my phone stayed at  for a few hours of use. Over the next days my phone seemed to better reflect the actual percent I dont know if thats even how phones work but thats what I experienced. I was able over the past  days to use GPS Bluetooth music to my car and not have a problem with battery even after  hoursmoving states sucks. The case isnt very good at being a case as it gives only a small ledge around the screen so I would say try to put the phone in your pocket screen to skin. If you already have another case maybe use that if your going to have a violent day but otherwise this works great. ,lgv10,d4i9cjf,4,t5_3a5la

So it cant be fixed by repair only improved design. With Android . in an effort to make the battery last longer they made the screen super dim which makes the retention allot worse thats why when you max out the screen brightness for a while the image retention clears up.,lgv10,d88b78s,1,t5_3a5la

This morning however I awoke to check my phone after charging overnight and it was unresponsive. I have since tried  different charging cords and a car charger and it doesnt respond to being charged by any of them. The power button has also become unresponsive as when I hold it down for  min nothing happens to the phone. The only response I can get from it is when I take the battery out for a couple minutes and the android logo appears after a vibration as it should but then after a couple seconds it blacks out and then becomes unresponsive yet again.

Ive returned phones for less within a year. They also offer a  day warranty themselves I believe beyond the manufacturer one. I find your claim questionable about the return not the bootloops and your demeanor more than a little inflammatory. iPhone  all have touch disease which will eventually get to all of them. So that whole year of their devices which are not worth buying used. They also have failed to innovate anything in the last few years. Samsung put out little explosives this year. LG had the bootloop problem which affected many devices but it seemed to be a manufacturing issue and not a design one.If you dont like the v. Thats cool.
