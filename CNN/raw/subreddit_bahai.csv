The quality of the experience was highly dependent on the quality of participation.  I dont recall the instructors being very hands on or active.  They felt like an anonymous assignmentgiver.Further there were some eccentric personalities...and online communication is always fraught without the aid of emoticons.  Defensiveness could sometimes set in when a comment was misinterpreted or overpersonalized.My impression probably should be taken with a grainpound of salt.  The summer I attempted it was bad for me psychologically and I couldnt get motivated to do the work so I am partly to blame for my poor experience.

775114,0,t3_230133,I agree that some Bahai divorces have causes similar to those of wider society.But I also think some causes for divorce are uniquely Bahai. In my nonscientific observation many young people meet at nationalinternational Bahai conferences and inspired by fleeting spiritual connections attempt to initiate a relationship over long distances. Later they find that their marriages failed due to personality traits that werent visible from afar. Moreover many wellmeaning Bahais exclusively seek relationships with traits that reflect important Bahai social values multicultural international serviceorientation but do not account for the core traits of the individual such as compatibility patience humility. Basically a certain hyperidealism motivates many young Bahais approach to marriage without understanding that marriage also depends on boring ordinary matters of attraction and lifestyle. In other words being two wings of a bird is as much an analogy for earthly purposes as well as spiritual ones. For the record Im a single nevermarried Bahai male in my s living in the US. And Im certainly still trying to figure it all out. ,bahai,cgsdv35,5,t5_2qi5p

1284311,0,t3_28rbsg,Hello! Thanks for the questions.I cant help you on the language or the calligraphy but...I would encourage you to read through these two compilations on Obligatory Prayers.Basically since Bahaullah prescribed  and Shoghi Effendi clarified  how to do the Medium prayer if you follow those instructions youre fine.  Theres no need to get tangled up in defining the day according to the Badi calendar.  It is assumed though that you complete an obligatory prayer for the days preceding and following the day you chose to do the Medium prayer...or you just always do the Medium prayer.As for the use of Amen  AFAIK it is a law only in Judaism and one that was developed through the oral history and commentary of the Talmud.  Christians adopted the custom and Muslims accepted it as well but it is not prescribed.  Amen is also primarily used in congregational prayer which the Bahai Faith eschews except for the Prayer for the Dead.  Most if not all Bahai prayers close with recitation of several of the Names of God. ,bahai,cie3nzz,2,t5_2qi5p

2655218,0,t3_2qbe7c,Hegel articulates this concept he called the LordBondsman dialectic. Generally speaking when two different people meet they can each recognize each other on their own terms and grow more fully or one can choose to reject the other and judge himher by his own ideas of that person. In this latter case the person rejecting the other is the Lord and the person rejected is the Bondsman. The Lord has a halfformed broken identity and their refusal to recognize the other only leads to a constant retreat inward to their own ideas. The Bondsman retains the freedom to grow gains insight into social situations by being rejected and can use the Lords own ideas against him.When people invent and defend ideas of the Bahai faith we should pity them. We become the Bondsman. We retain the freedom to perceive reality. We dont fear the other and we enjoy discourse. Its such a pity such people dont want to accept others on their own terms.

3113243,0,t1_cojf6vc,The love is allowed to exist though prejudice plays out towards this also in community life only the physical expression is frowned upon disallowed.Yes this is problematic. It is not explained well in the writings save through a moral definition that appears and is in effect judgemental and inclined to generate one could presume on application and taking on board pain suffering loss cognitive dissonance and alienation all the things the faith is purported to be about aiming at reducing and dissolving in human societies. Long term effects?I have a perspective unofficial pertaining to a larger context but I dont really have an answer for this and it stumps me also.I would link some possible reasons for this to metaphysics where two forces are identified and conceived of now reduced in association and meaning in English to masculine and feminine but originally indicating deeper and more profounder forces pertaining to creation in its origins forces clearly delineated and distinguished in terms of qualities and function Purusha and Prakriti in Sanskrit and after Samkaya for instance Yang and Yin after Taoism the active force and its recipient after Bahaullah. We exist in a world of creation created Nasut after the hierarchy of worlds in Bahaullahs cosmology after Sufism. The teachings are transmitted from another dimension Jabarut or Command where perhaps or presumably these forces still exist very clearly delineated singular forces in interaction if that indeed is a dimension of dualisms like here. Here in this dimension were dealing with psychological and biological realites and interiorities where distinctions of definition and function are crossed mixed in flux inverted mutated projected reified and so on. The distinctions of qualities roles and function in terms of these forces are not so easily discernible across different individuals nor are they crystalline except perhaps in terms of gendered biology they are in fluid in potentia if not in performance. We in gendered bodies and psychologies embody represent and are these archetypal forces in varying degrees of conscious knowledge and countenance. The teachings on this may Im attempting to think through this this isnt correct by any means be related to means of bringing about distinctions of quality and function in terms of those forces in the human system and interior effects of detachment of identity between self bodymind experiential identifications and location and Self or Soul also existing on another plane but associated with the body towards relocating certain effects on consciousness and identification that become reified through this mixing going on interiorly and externally in this dimension. This isnt necesarily inherently wrong or bad or negative but it appears so when its dressed up in a moral judgement.However this is problematic in terms of justice and love which are unaccounted for absent in the moral ruling this is wrong but it is not explained why which hinders development of compassionate understanding and removes elements of agency.That isnt an answer either doesnt resolve your question or perspective.

5196398,0,t3_3m5sa0,Hi there Ive spoken to people who have been brought up believing the BahaiFaith was a cult before.There are a few things which I felt helped in particular when I was trying to dissuade them. Progressive revelation. This is a religion which considers itself the next step of all religions. It accepts Muslims Jews Christians and others as all coming from the same God at different points in time. Typically a Cult diverges greatly from previous revelationWitness or it claims to be something completely newScientology. Independant investigation.We are to investigate the faith by ourselves without being told by someone else what we should think. If we disagree at any point we just walk away. Acceptance of others and interaction with other communities.A very important part of the Bahai faith is to accept others even if they are going against our understanding of Gods Law. These people should be loved interacted with and helped in any way we can. We are also encouraged to go out in the community and build relationships with others with different belief systems or even no beliefs of their own. Any hierarchy that may be perceived in the faith is not permanent. Really there isnt a hierarchy but there is administrative people. Every position such as LSA member to Universal House of Justice member is voted on by the community. Even in the UHJ there are times when someone just isnt on it anymore. Cult leaders keep power. Material posessions of those who are well regardedheavily involved. Typically in a cult the people who are in charge have some level of power or material wealth due to their position. As I said Bahais dont really have these positions of power. We have administrative leaders but not spiritual leaders in the traditional sensethose who tell us what to think or how to react or even vote! Man if a Bahai member ever tells you how to vote in Government OR in the Faith it is a huge NO NO. They may even lose their voting rights. Anyway those people who are administrative do not have mansions or huge cars or whatever is associated with wealthy cult leaders. They live moderately.I hope these points help. I suggest approach some of these head on. Say to her look lets look at this point and see how it stands up. There is a lot of negative talk about the faith out there and it is important to investigate that information openly together so she has a better understanding.All the best!,bahai,cvccyko,5,t5_2qi5p
5198696,0,t1_cvcfxp6,Let me give you an example where that is an appropriate request.  I was in a large community of over  Bahais. We would gather for  day feast at a community hall and many people would be there each feast. Every time wed see new guests new faces and old faces. There was always someone new. The secretary would be informed of any nonregular person attending as a way to kindly introduce and welcome them.  However at one point we would have some middle eastern men attend in groups of two or threes. They said they came without anyone inviting them and had friends in Iran who were Bahai. The secretary was surprised that no one knew who these men were.   Despite this we continued the feast but altered the admin program.  Soon we found out that these men were Muslims who were trying to find out about the Bahai faith in order to go back to Iran and attack the Bahais with anything they had learned.  Others had different stories. Some wanted to become Bahais in order to get refugee status granted quickly without having any knowledge of the Bahai faith. They wanted to use it as a expediting agent.  So imagine youre at feast a place where you can feel comfortable knowing youre protected in an environment of mutual beliefs and no one has the intention of causing disunity.. and then you have random people show up and try to cause dissension.  In most cases this would be a rare event. But in places such as Los Angeles or my community in Australia there is a need for Bahai ID to ensure that the people who do attend are Bahais and no just going by assumption.  Maybe in your case it wasnt like the above mentioned and that is a learning process where we should feel welcomed rather than be overboard on strictness for who is Bahai and who isntwho is allowed to attendwho isnt. At the end of the day... we should strive for unity even when were with our enemies or with people unaware of the Bahai faith. ,bahai,cvcmwt3,3,t5_2qi5p

5364236,0,t1_cvxblac,Just as the physical laws are at once the constraints and also the enablers of life on Earth and in the rest of physical existence the moralspiritual laws constrain and enable the most productive moral and spiritual life. Asking why these  particular moralspiritual laws is very similar to asking why these about our physical laws. Why do we need gravity? Whats up with magnetism? Etc. The answer is  for me we have no idea why those ones and not others but its how Creation is set up and we can see the utility and wisdom of the laws in action. ,bahai,cvxcbe7,3,t5_2qi5p
5537634,0,t1_cwip6c1,gtI am not certain that our desire to have an objective base for morality is the proof of the existence of deity. I feel we should believe something because we determine it is true not because we like it to be true.Its not the desire for morality to be objective that proves God exists.  Its the actual belief that most people have that morality is objective including atheists.  I feel that this is an irrational belief without the existence of a moral creator.  Its a common argument  The problem is that we cannot objectively prove that morality is... objective.  The proof of morality is very much related to the proof of God.  Its impossible to empirically prove that there is a right or a wrong.gtI feel that Bahai morality is relative as truth is relative. If we believe in God because of the morality of the life of the Manifestation of God we must consider their morality in a relative sense. Example that Bahaullah had  ? wives which was moral in the time and place he lived. I understand that morality or truth is relative within certain contexts.  But we can differentiate between social laws and the deeper universal moral truths behind them.  The social laws our hearts dont necessarily recognize are those like keeping hair on our heads or saying an obligatory prayer once instead of three times a day or having a day feast abstaining from alcohol premarital sex etc.  These laws are moral for this time not necessarily for any other.  But we should always be kind loving generous compassionate and I think the vast majority of people recognize that as true.gtTo debate with atheist is difficult one. If they are looking for empirical evedence for God they may not find it.  One may ask an atheist what kind of proof would you accept for existence of God? And it usually boils down to their religious background. Yeah I agree.  In my experience they are generally arguing against their own belief system not necessarily ours.  There are a number of interesting logical arguments for God that might give an atheist who is open to God something to think about.  In the end though its not a debate that can be won... in a debate.  ,bahai,cwjhcei,1,t5_2qi5p

5870233,0,t1_cxoc61t,Thats like saying Christianity is a Jewish religion because it is built off Judaism. So although they are related they are very different. The Bahai Faith has laws and principles just like Islam and Christianity and every other religion does. Bahai laws are no more or less Sharia than Christian or Jewish laws are. There are more similarities between Jewish laws and Islamic laws than there are between Bahai and Islamic ones. Bahaullah claims to be the return of Christ so your premises that all of its claims comes from islamic prophecies is false. Bahais dont recognise Muhammad as the final messenger but yes the seal of the prophets from the past cycle. Muslims do not believe that any Manifestation will come after Muhammad yet alone a new cycle be started by one and would be deeply offended for our Faith to be called a Muslim religion as we are considered apostates. We believe the Quran was the word of God  years ago as much as we believe the Bible was the word of God  years ago. The Bahai Faith also keeps many teachings from every other major world religion not Islam specifically. For example yes just like Muslims were forbidden to drink but polygamy for example was prohibited in Christianity then allowed in Islam then prohibited again. The Bahai Faith is an independent world religion and is no more an Islamic religion as it is a Christian Jewish Buddhist Hindu or Zoroastrian one. ,bahai,cxp4ad2,1,t5_2qi5p

6152373,0,t1_cyoxfav,And its an interesting topic for sure!See I dont think seeing a ghost for example is necessarily at odds with the Faith. For instance people have experienced seeing Abdul Baha in various situations including my father who swears he saw Him plain as day on two occasions but the reality of what hepeople witnessed may not correspond with the common idea of what a ghost is. Perhaps its more of a vision...of heightened spiritual discernment...something like that rather than an actual physical apparition or a soul in limbo as some have believed. We cant really say for sure.Abdul Baha doesnt say its impossible. He says that often many simple hearted people will believe theyve experienced such things and are sincere in their belief. But on the other hand we know that the prophets and certain disciples have had real experiencesthe nature of which we cant comprehend. Theres a story about the Bab while he was in the prison of Maku. The warden was approaching the prison on horseback when he says he saw the Bab freed from His cell kneeling by a river deep in prayer. The warden was amazed and furious that the guards would allow the Bab to leave His cell. He raced over to the prison to chastise the guards and upon his arrival he found that the Bab was still imprisoned in His cell. The Bab said to the warden that He wanted him to see this vision to know that God has absolute power over the workings of men. But to some if put in this position they would swear they had seen a ghost!Ill find the source for this story if youre interested I read it ages ago and its stuck with me ever since. There are many such stories spanning different revelations. We might call these visions we see ghosts but the definition we assign to the word ghost may not correspond to the reality of what were experiencing.I dunno.

6996021,0,t3_4bhkpw,That guidance they are thinking of was for a long time ago and has since been overwritten by updates from the House. And it was NOT to not have any association with Muslims. It was to be very careful. Here is a good repository at the Bahai wikia. Looks to be exactly the same as from here at Lights of Guidance which as usual has absolutely everything in it. Love that book!gtAs a general rule the friends should not seek out contacts among Orientals i.e. those of Muslim background from the Middle East Pakistan and India whether students or not. However when contact with Orientals occurs in the course of normal social events the friends as in all other cases should show courtesy and kindness but in these days when the political situation is so confused the friends should consciously avoid making any effort to convert Orientals to the Faith.gtShould such individuals however show real interest in the Faith even to the point of wishing to declare your National Assembly should be contacted by either the Local Spiritual Assembly or the individual teacher so that you in turn can contact the National Spiritual Assembly of the country of origin of the applicant giving that Assembly full particulars and requesting it to inform you whether there is any objection to the enrolment of that particular individual. Nevertheless if it appears that the Oriental wishing to declare is contemplating a return to his own country soon you should follow your present practice of requesting that he declare to the proper administrative institution of his own country.And DIRECTLY to your concerngtThe House of Justice feels that the friends and sometimes the Bah institutions have tended to overreact to the instructions given from time to time about contacting and teaching Muslims from Iran and other places in the Middle East and they often take to extremes the cautions given in such instructions. The friends sometimes think they should shun such people entirely or that any contact with them is considered a breach of Bah law. We are asked to point out that the House of Justice has never forbidden the friends to contact Iranian Muslims as such a general prohibition would be contrary to the spirit of the Faith. However given the history and the current situation of the Faith in Iran it has urged the friends in the West to act toward these people with wisdom and caution. In fact the House of Justice has clarified the matter on various occasions by stating the following to National Spiritual AssembliesgtThe instructions of the beloved Guardian regarding teaching orientals from the Middle East are to be upheld even more so at this time because of the present situation in Iran. Iranian Muslims in particular should not be sought out in order to teach them the Faith. It cannot be categorically said however that the friends should have no contact with Iranian Muslims. Some of the Bahs have relatives who are Iranian Muslims some have close Iranian Muslim friends who happen to reside in the West and they should not relinquish these friendships. At the same time it should be stressed to the Iranian Bahs that while they should not cut themselves off from their Muslim relatives and friendsa step which could create animosity and turn them against the Faiththey should not normally seek out Iranian Muslims in order to initiate friendly contacts with them or teach them the Faith.gtFrom a letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada March   in Lights of Guidance no. This is the OLD guidance. Very old! And yet it still says that folks have gone too nutso with the caution and wrongly shunned peoplejust as you have observed.Anyway these old cautions have since been superceded by encouragement to teach the Faith freely among Muslims out in the free worldand especially by Persians to actively teach such people. NOT in countries where it is still illegalunwise such as Iran Malaysia etc. Who can link to some of that new guidance?Try to introduce them to the new guidance if someone posts it here and that last quote about it being totally wrong to avoid people and gradually educate them.,bahai,d19cbsp,9,t5_2qi5p

Shoghi Effendi had a particular mission and role in relation to realising the vision of Bahaullah.In saying that the purpose of religion that Bahaullah conveys and defends is that of one to bring forth the hidden gems embedded in human potential and realities. There is the collective and the unique system with its varying participative domains and demands and there is the individual task to bring forth what is in effect to be as I imagine it some kind of suprasubjectivity an evolved kind of individualism able to move in the collective but not swamped and lost to the demands of such able to navigate this and also manifest the particular qualities imbued and latent with each individual characteristics and potentials unique to them in their difference allied to varying degrees of capacity and learning with specific kinds of service.

Theology is part of this but can still make appearances of difference through doctrinal divergences of interpretation. Find the key ideas that are the same in religions ie. the Dharmic religions recognise the Dharma which although employed with multiple meanings across various traditions can be defined after notions of the law. This can be extended to Bahai even though Bahai is a religion of the Book.

9605373,0,t3_5cjkuz,Bahais as individuals are encouraged to be open to all people and the Bahai administrations authority is entirely voluntarily that is they do not seek to exert any authority over nonBahais so the Bahai community is accepting of homosexuality from a secular point of view and indeed the Universal House of Justice has encouraged Bahais to support the end to oppression of homosexuals in the wider community I am not sure of the specific date of the letter or where it would be available unfortunately.However the Bahai Faith does not allow Bahais to express homosexuality sexually although I think characterising it as being condemned is incorrect framing the Bahai writings do not contain a specific reference to homosexuality to my knowledge the closest reference that is sometimes interpreted as being a direct reference is to my knowledge actually a condemnation of the middle eastern tradition of dancing boys.Rather the institution of marriage is defined in the Bahai writings as being between a man and a woman and sexual expression outside of marriage is forbidden. As such homosexuality is assumed to not be permitted under these specifications. However Shoghi Effendi does say one can not rank homosexual sexual practice as any better or worse than any other act that is not permitted by the writings.,bahai,d9x24q4,7,t5_2qi5p
9654101,0,t1_da31tg1,Thank you my friend this is a very nice article.  gt We can engage in public discourse on issues of general concern to society based on Bah principles such as global climate change race unity the advancement of women global prosperity etc.  Well thats reassuring.  Also I understand that these guidelines are meant to last as long as the current governance system is in place but that it will be abrogated when societies evolve in a Bahai way am I right ?  Anyway this is quite enlightening. I think more and more of monks who are very helpful comforting but neutral I dont like that word. They see things from above which prevents them from being politically engaged in the partisan sense of the term yet they are very wellconsidered by the society I think of Catholic and Buddhist monks. It seems that we need to cultivate that sense of being above which sounds almost like an outside of pettiness low earthling matters while trying to embody wisdom.,bahai,da32hhu,4,t5_2qi5p

9835962,0,t1_dapkz89,gt But I heard a very interesting or different understanding of what this really means to repeat Gods name  times a day.  The verse  implies that it needs to be done in a row.  gt a prayer that shall rise above words and letters and transcend the murmur of syllables and sounds  Interesting !  gt It seems to me that this Revelation is still in the sowing seed period.  Absolutely. That or the seeds are just at the beginning of taking root.  gt I am not sure exactly the cause and effect chain  if it is limited to material explinations or if there is some spiritual growth and intellectual growth in evolution that many may be experiencing.  There is definitely a correlation between the spiritual evolution of mankind and the fact that we expand the horizon of our mental activity through modern technolofy thanks to car driving and video games we think faster we treat more informations in shorter lapsees of times and the images and sounds of the modern world are way heavier than that of the ancient world.  gt We often think of evolution as something that has ended.  We are evolving but spirituality is beginning to condition our evolution it seems.  gt I think the technology boom must come from mans brain in part. Is it evolving? Are parts of the human brain opening up and communicating with other parts of brain that did not  or  years ago? It could be.  Could be indeed. Some suggest on the contrary that it is the technology that shapes our brain and we transmit that shape to our children. ,bahai,dapncjo,2,t5_2qi5p
10233143,0,t3_5m485g,This is a throwaway account. After a cursory reading of part one of the refutation I would like to bring this quote to your attentiongtO ye peoples of the earth! During the time of My absence I sent down the Gates unto you. However the believers except for a handful obeyed them not. Formerly I sent forth unto you Amad and more recently Kim but apart from the pure in heart amongst you no one followed them. What hath befallen you O people of the Book? Will ye not fear the One true God He Who is your Lord the Ancient of Days? O ye who profess belief in God! I adjure you by Him Who is the Eternal Truth have ye discerned among the precepts of these Gates anything inconsistent with the commandments of God as set forth in this Book? Hath your learning deluded you by reason of your impiety? Take ye heed then for verily your God the Lord of Eternal Truth is with you and in very truth is watchful over you. Chapter XXVII. Selections from the Writings of the BbYou may want to refresh your memory of The DawnBreakers p. liliv From what I understand humanity was graced with direct guidance from God from the declaration of Muhammad  AD to the death of the fourth and last Gate  AD.

11371482,0,t1_dfkvzto,This is a wonderfully formulated question and really is the essential one. How can we know?I think you have to read whats available from every source apply it to your life consult your heart and pay attention to the effect these teachings have on yourself and others you meet. Anything from God should have a result beyond mere words and ideas though it may take a little while to recognize it.Although we carry in our heads our own standards of truth discovering real truth must involve abandoning that personal standard at some point. Otherwise we could not learn anything truly new since it would not fit our preconceptions. This is as much true in science as anything else. The trick is how and when to discard what we know for something new. Are we being deceived? Am I throwing away truth for delusion? Or the opposite?Stay sharp purge your heart from every attachment and pay attention to whats happening around you. I trust in your humanity that at some point what is true will begin to illuminate the background.,bahai,dfkxpuj,5,t5_2qi5p

11601908,0,t3_64d3ow,gtBut My first request would not have been beyond your strength  if you had only trusted Me.When ones test is to unlearn that ones own self its systems of operations its agency and the promptings and guidance of God that arise through that cannot be trusted then youre in for a hell of a ride of a test.Why a suggestion towards possible culpable guilt for not being able to trust? Or is this after a manner of reminding us of our potential? The assertions prescribed appears to suggest a universalism out of its specificity of original context but how does that work subjectively? Mistrust is long learned deeply embedded in humanity. As are also developmental variations of constructed false not judgement laden in its usage here selves. Who do we learn to trust ourselves from or through the first step in learning to trust the guidance and imposition of tests from the Will of God when our parents or teachers or society convey a mixed message and displacement of trust into questionable outsourced external priorly compromised forms and authorities then introjected as socialised through? It isnt like we learn universally how to deal effectively with the various hands life deals us in our upbringing or education in terms of a deep trust what that involves or how to process the situations that come to us so we can even respond appropriately to what were called to by Spirit as much as events. Even the spiritual in its guidance or forms of appearance isnt a reliable teacher in some regions of this process unless and until certain kinds of selfSelf understanding are reached.,bahai,dgb32ze,1,t5_2qi5p
