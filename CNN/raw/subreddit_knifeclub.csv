Otherwise I like the Kershaw Baby Boa with a flipper aluminum scales and a . blade.  Its really attractive but a little flashy for me I own one and would probably never get rid of it because its fun to flip and play with but does have a healthy recurve so if youre opposed to that you may not want it.The SOG Twitch II fits your description and its a very unassuming knife but its got this weird split top backlock design that Im not terribly fond of.

As for CTSXHP Ive heard that its very similar to CPMD which has exceptional toughness and good edge retention. Both of the knives are made in Taichung which arguably pumps out the best made knives of spydercos lineup though it would be fair to say its not better than but just as good as the Golden factory.

904042,0,t1_ch5gbxw,SV is unique. It has really high primary carbide content but those carbides are relatively small. Still its no razor steel. The carbides in it are nowhere near as small as in a low carbon stainless. Those carbides are really hard and they can interfere with getting a polished razor edge.If you are finishing with a high grit gt US a fine diamond hone and a light hand might give you a better initial edge than some of the softer stones. Diamond has some ability to break up those carbides into smaller pieces. Still I think youll get the best edge by finishing on a strop regardless same as regular high carbide stainless steels. Id give a wood strop a try yes because I suspect you might be rounding your edge. If used properly you cannot overstrop with a wood strop. SV should be able to take a really fine polishedmirrored edge that push cuts and still slices aggressively.But you see this is a tradeoff. In order to get a sticky sharp polished edge on a high carbide steel you need to spend some time on a strop. And then that edge doesnt last very long anyway. This is why razors arent made out of SV. For applications where you need that high a level of sharpness a mild stainless or a plain carbon might be better suited. You can maintain and restore that level of sharpness with just a few swipes on a fine hone. This is why wood carving knives and razors tend to me made of plain carbon or mild stainless steels.This is why I dont buy into steel rankings. If you are obsessed with the very sharpest of edges the cheap steels are hard to beat. You can use them at maximum sharpness and restore and maintain that edge in seconds. Trying to make a super steel that will be able to keep a true razor edge while cutting stuff besides hair is futile. The supersteels are good at keeping a fairly sharp edge for longer but if you want to run at scary sharpness you will end up spending just as much or even more time maintaining that edge vs a cheap steel. So for an everyday user your time might be better spent by not polishing the edge on SV. Traditional steel rankings show you which steels hold a decent edge longer.

944345,0,t3_24x1q6,Im with ucolonelbunkymustard on the benchmade . The price is about right and I have a lot of benchmadesspydercoskershaws and the  just seems so solid. The only reserve most people have with it is the handle material which to some feels very plasticy. I personally do not mind it and enjoy that it is easy to clean water resistant and extremely durable in the case of dropping it.Also good to keep in mind is that for a slightly higher price you can go on the benchmade website and personalize it as the colonel suggested. You could do a really cool color combination and then his initials engraved etc etc.Another thing that comes to mind is a Buck Vantage Pro in S v. I havent personally gotten my hands on one but for the price I hear good things about them. They offer two sizes and if you dont want the sv you can downgrade to lower steels to reduce the price.EDIT gtDepending on how much time you have you could sign up for bladeforums and between rknifeswap and blade forums you might find a high quality gently used knife for a lower price. Thats what I have been doing for my friends and it seems to work well.

1462773,0,t3_2ax42c,Thanks to uTheHsza for posting the sale link. Action weight and build feel nice on the knife. I can see it being a great EDC. It has reasonable traction although I wouldnt call it great. I dont feel like its going to slip out of my hand or Im going to fly onto the blade but it is smooth enough I would think twice about stabbing into anything really heavy in a forward grip.Custom hardware looks nice. Unusual thumbstuds feel good on deploy and look cool. Pivot screw looks pretty nice as well but does take a standard torx so adjustments shouldnt be an issue. Lanyard attachment is actually on the spine side of the butt of the handle. The back spacer is cut out and there is a post going through so a lanyard can be threaded along the knife rather than through it. Looks cool coming off a post like that and not having the hole. I was able to thread a piece of paracord through it without removing the core so thats good too.Pocket clip looks ok and rides decently deep tip up left  right only but out of the box it was really tight which made it hard to clip on to my jeans. Its smooth enough that removal is easy its just a little harder to put in the pocket.Nonmilled steel liners on both sides make it a little heavier but it also feels really sturdy because of it. The liners are reasonably thick so the liner lock feels like its pretty robust.Was reasonably sharp out of box as well. Certainly was able to go through phonebook paper although not quite shaving sharp. Will probably sharpen it myself before carrying.Feels like its definitely worth the money. Paid  on the sale but it feels nice enough to be worth the ish that I usually see it for.,knifeclub,cizmuoa,3,t5_2ulfn

Since I already know about it and cant have it yet I thought taking a couple pictures of it would help ease the anticipation. I know its a newly released knife and havent seen anyone post about it yet. I had a chance to inspect it before I made a decision and it was down to this or the  Mini Reflex. I opted for this because of the confusing laws surrounding automatic knives. Theyre not technically illegal in my state but Im not one to push the envelope on things like that. Traveling for work and pleasure also played a role in that decision. At this point I can only hope my wife is as happy with what I got her as I am with this knife.,knifeclub,cjj574u,3,t5_2ulfn

1797918,0,t3_2f4bfo,Made this over the course of a couple of weeks downtime so probably something like  hours in it cut me some slack Im basically teaching myself all of this. The blade is   purchased preannealed from New Jersey Steel Baron and cut to shape. The grind was mostly handfiled but I eventually got impatient and made several mistakes so I just finished it up with a belt sander. I finished it with a forced patina using mustard. The handle is Bocote and the the pins are steel rods arranged inside of a brass tube. I lost some clarity on one of the pins at some point during the process but the pattern is still kind of visible. Finished the Bocote with several coats of walnut oil. The sheath I made from some scrap chrometan leather we had sitting around the shop and I stitched it with paracord because I had some handy. So what do yall think?,knifeclub,ck5rz8s,2,t5_2ulfn

1830433,0,t1_ck9pz9h,Yeah something like that. It also depends on the composition of the steel. Certain steels can handle more acute angles while others cant. A good example is high hardness kitchen knives. They are thin and wear resistant this allows them to do lots of high repetitions of up and down think prepping veggies on a cutting board and make good slices. If you have a nice acute edge it will help with those  reps.,knifeclub,ck9rdig,2,t5_2ulfn

1904997,0,t1_ckifwog,You shouldnt have to switch. A Lansky particularly one with the extended stone selection will make a good edge and should definitely be able to trim hair. I still suspect this is somehow a burr issue. The easiest test I know of is to over strop one side of the knife on cardboard intentionally rolling the burr as much as possible and trying the paper test again. If it does so so and a few strops on either side improve your results dramatically you still have a burr. Clear it off by pulling the knife through cardboard or a wine cork and follow with more edge trailing strokes. Or of course go to the next highest angle setting on the Lanksy and lay in a microbevel.If that doesnt work you have me beat. Youre reaching the apex and working with a guided system. Theres only so much that can go wrong.,knifeclub,ckiqnu8,1,t5_2ulfn

2155506,0,t1_clds790,You know its actually fantastic. Detent is just right action is super smooth. They did a fantastic job with this midtech. Its definitely worth the  dollars they were selling it for at the knife show. I dont know if youve played with another graham or have any experience with the tail clip but its fantastic. One of my favorite work carries simply because of the way it disappears into your pockets seamlessly. It does take a little getting used to because I usually anchor my fingers against the pocket clip so when I flip it out and there is some recoil sometimes if Im not careful it almost falls out of my hand.But TLDR great knife and well worth it. ,knifeclub,cldtb7o,1,t5_2ulfn
2156016,0,t1_cldv6go,It definitely does take some getting used to like I mentioned but its very utilitarian. Heres a couple of things I noticed.Sits super low in your pocket.To extract the knife you cant use the pocket clip to help pull the knife out instead you have to actually reach into your pocket with your pointer finger and thumb to pull the knife out of your pocket.

2978061,0,t1_co634jn,I did mod mine though I havent posted it. I dont like the look of some people milling a circle out where the Spydie hole is covered. It ruins the lines of the knife.What I ended up doing was grinding the showside down to the level of the G throughout the finger groove. I didnt really like how it looked so I ground the G down to match the shadow boxing of the rest of the frame. I also chamfered the lockbar because the jimping is sharp. I like this so much more because it creates a solution to the problem without ruining the aesthetic. Its so subtle you would think its standard.,knifeclub,co6mdms,2,t5_2ulfn

2995202,0,t1_co84evm,Of course it doesnt make sense for any existing knives because they were already designed around a certain lock.  A CBBL Endura would be awkward like a back lock PM.  Though the Manix was originally a lock back.  I would like to see a couple of new designs with a compression lock or even a CBBL.  Its neat that Spyderco is doing a lot of collaborations but this year seemed to be a bit anemic on the for the most part original Spyderco designs.  I have a feeling that the U.S. knives are where the majority of the more unique locks are going to be implemented and the Colorado factory is probably not capable of handling several new knives on top of the current offerings which still have a lot of demand.  ,knifeclub,co8g8bs,2,t5_2ulfn

3019240,0,t3_2ur5vq,They are both strong enough to be abused for a decade or more so on that front they are a tie. The Benchmade is going to be fatter in the hand. To some people this is comfortable enough to negate the extra space it takes up in the pocket. PM is very comfortable as well. Keep in mind the blade is designed to be a little small for the handle on the PM and a more traditional handle to blade ratio is on the Benchmade.Price us up to you these prices are pretty fair for the knife you are getting. CM is going to be slightly less capable of holding a keen edge for a long time compared to SV SV is the better steel but CM is good and on par with VG. Both locks are excellent just different. Lefties will prefer an Axis lock. You cant go wrong with either really. Whenever I make comparisons which end in a draw like this I usually pick aesthetics or in this case the opening hole vs thumb stud. The Paramilitary  would win for me based on this.  ,knifeclub,coaxwr1,5,t5_2ulfn

3468499,0,t1_cpnmrlo,Well the diamond rods are much coarser. They also make cbn rods which people have found to be at least as coarse as the diamond rods if not slightly coarser so those would be better for removing more metal if a more aggressive sharpening is called for. I currently only have the base set and a little freehand diamond stone and then some high grit sandpapers to finish stuff up after the sharpmaker but whether you want the add on rods is up to you. It certainly is convenient that they make a few different types of sharpening rods to add to it and it all fits.,knifeclub,cpnmtww,1,t5_2ulfn

I start my post HT bevel grind to bring the thickness of the edge down to .. at  grit then work my way back up to my desired finish.  I do the same thing when sharpening.  Cool the part down if it starts to get too hot to hold.

3620065,0,t1_cq4vvlc,They dont have to.  Liner locks and frame locks dont take much to fail.  Unlike a lot of actual locks they dont really lock the knife open but prop it open.  They also did a test on the Spyderco Tatanka or whatever it is Im not looking it up right now And the lock never failed though the blade did break.  The reality is that whatever you put up against either a triad lock or a compression lock it probably wont beat either one.  Both those designs are just really strong.  And besides liner lock and frame locks most other popular knife locks actually have to break the handle to fail.  So most common locks will do better than frame and liner locks.  Given a certain minimum quality.  And again in regular use it doesnt really matter.,knifeclub,cq4wwy3,1,t5_2ulfn

Dremel and bits  I used this bit for grinding out the choil  I also have a dremel work station so that helped me keep the dremel stable but you dont need this part.. Glass of water. Protective wear glasses face mask gloves if you wishThen I marked the knife with a sharpie where I wanted the choil to be and went to work.  Just slowly and steadily grinding at the blade flipping it now and then to make sure its even.  Dont forget to frequently dip your blade in the water to make sure it doesnt get too hot to mess up the heat treat.  And thats it!  After I was done I sanded down the edges of the choil a bit with some high grit sand paper to smooth them out.,knifeclub,cra2mhl,2,t5_2ulfn

4018564,0,t3_36iivt,Dont sweat the haters! Honestly anybody who knows at least a little about knife brands knows that Kershaw makes quality knives that hold up to whatever you can throw at them. Plus there are very few knife companies out there with warranties and customer service as good as KAIs!What matters is that when you grab your knife in the morning it makes you happy that youre holding it and that when you reach for it to use that it does what you need it to well! All the rest is chaff. Ive had everything from midtechs to hardware store knives and hell I still frequently use my  year old Gerber Paraframe I that made a helluva knife back then IMO and we all know how people feel about Gerber around here for the most part haha. Also the Sharpmaker is great but so is having freehand sharpening skills on a whetstone! In fact Id take the skills over the system any day since being able to do that means you can sharpen your knife on most anything you have on hand. I do both freehand and use my Sharpmaker and usually do both in conjunction. Sometimes I even use the Sharpmaker as a freehand stone. Anyway post more here on knifeclub where people are awesome.

4048353,0,t3_36wilo,Hey guys!  Thanks for posting the video utestunagouchi glad you like it!Im actually going through the process of seriously retooling my shop at the moment with the goal of being more productive and efficient so I can get more knives out to wonderful customers!In January I bought a beatup vertical machining center large CNC milling machine then spent a few months rebuilding it. I then spent a month or so reorganizing my shop and saving money to buy tooling and so on for the mill hooray for tax returns!.I now have the mill and tooling and Im working on prototypes and processes for the new version of the Resolute!The new version will be in between the  and  versions in terms of size. Roughly . blade  overall. Slightly larger in the handle than the previous  version to fill the hand a bit better slightly shorter than the previous  version for better tip control.The blade will be A tool steel at HRC. Handles will be G as usual! Im planning to have the blades either DLC coated or something similar. Im looking into actually doing a multistep coating with something like chromium nitride underneath the DLC for hugely enhanced corrosion protection. Thats still up in the air though.The new sheaths will be vacuum formed from either kydex or zytel and will be of my new  layer design which eliminates any possibility of jamming the blade when resheathing. The sheath will also have more space around the blade to reduce scratching and to further reduce the likelihood of the blade freezing into the sheath when put away wet in freezing conditions.Overall the new knife will be similar to my previous models but lots of little improvements all round!I started work on the prototypes for the new Resolute blade on Wednesday theres a short video of me and the machine in action here And theres a video covering the restoration of the machine here I always love chatting with you guys about this stuff so please let me know if you have any questions!Aaron,knifeclub,crhqrzm,9,t5_2ulfn

4143950,0,t1_crsl9h9,Think about fighting you might see on TV like the UFC.  seconds is a LOT of time when youre in a fight. Most street fights might not even last  minutes either someone breaks it up or someone gets knocked out or injured. In either case it only takes a couple of seconds to get really hurt. Thats why when you train to defend yourself you should pick a fighting system that focuses on getting in causing damage and extracting yourself. You shouldnt train to stand there and bang out or rely on  seconds to one minute for your opponent to bleed out. Knees and elbows are vital spots. From a knife fighting perspective you could damage a tendon but on an elbow they could still use that arm if adrenaline is flowing resulting in a few wild swings that might still hit you. With knees theres more to cut through a slash might be deep enough or it might just be shallow enough to break the skin. That might cause bleeding but it could be enough to shrug off. Attacking joints is kind of the realm of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and similar arts. Striking a knee or an elbow is a good way to hurt yourself because in most situations theyll be slightly bent.  BJJ focuses on getting the right positioning to immobilize the limb then you can hyperextend or break it. A mobile limb just flapping in the breeze so to speak is actually pretty hard to hyper extend because a strike will just knock it back unless youre some kung fu master who can exert multiple hundreds of ftlbs of force on a single target. If youre going to kick someones leg the side of the knee is not a bad idea or repeated kicks to the quadshamstrings. Eventually with enough kicks they wont be able to put weight on it. Thats actually a pretty common MMA technique. Some people in MMA matches forfeit outright because theyve been kicked in one leg so many times and just cant walk. gtI would sure not want my face near someones foot but its also a possibility especially if youre strugglingfighting on the ground.True but a couple of things If their foot is near your face on the ground you are probably going to be guarding your face to keep from getting kicked or youre going to be focused on kicking your attacker in the face assuming your feet are near his face. It would be a better idea if youre struggling on the ground like that to work for a better position preferably on top away from the feet into some type of mount position. Then if the attacker is not trained in some ground fighting style you can attack the face with punches or elbows or if you really feel a knife is necessary it probably would be needlessly cruel and hard to legally justify at that point you have the option to use that on the targets I already identified. Or alternatively hold the guy down until assistance can get there. gtIm glad someone else sees it as a possibility but also understands the consequences and responsibility that these actions would have. Words running away and other methods will always be better but I like to have something for that just in case situation. Most of you guys live in the US where and I dont mean to undermine your violence problems one of the worst things that could happen would be being assaulted for your possessions. I live in Mexico and I wouldnt hesitate for a second about pulling out my knife if I was being kidnapped. I would much rather have them kill me then and there than be turned into a slave sold mutilated and tortured at a later time. Thats just my opinion though.I dont subscribe to the idea that its a bad idea for self defense. It is a bad idea to pull your knife out if somebody has approached you with one. If it came down to a situation where your life depends on it absolutely all bets are off do what you have to in order to survive! You are right most violence problems in the US dont result from something like human trafficking. Mostly what we have to deal with here are robberies and even more common the person who has either had too much to drink too many drugs or a mental illness and suddenly decides to buck up. Those situations are still dangerous you can still get seriously injured or killed but youre right theres no immediate danger of being snatched up and held tortured or anything like that. ,knifeclub,crsmloa,1,t5_2ulfn

A little bit about my experience with it so far  Packaging wasnt anything impressive though I suppose thats sorta the norm. The action was a lot stiffer than I thought it would be. Its smoothed out a bit over the past few days. Also not as sharp as I hoped it would come maybe my expectations arent very realistic?. Aside from that though the construction is great. Theres no blade play at all. It doesnt feel that small in the hand due to the shape of the body. Its definitely the lightest knife I own. I sometimes forget its even in my pocket.

5369561,0,t1_cvy0mas,What Im saying is Amazon holds the power. They already get an arguably unfair advantages on the prices due to selling such a high volume of product and Spyderco not using any real MAP pricing. As soon as all of your products funnel through one channel its gonna have a lot of potential to create issues. Spyderco should be trying to keep their market as diverse as possible without compromising quality. By all means stay out of big box stores its really hard to keep quality up in those stores while keeping prices low but keep your online markets open. If you are willing to sell to knives to amazon at such a low price that a consumer can buy it for less than a dealer then dealers lose all interest in selling your product.,knifeclub,cvy0shc,1,t5_2ulfn

Done correctly its beautiful and you wont notice a difference in function Id recommend using a synthetic if you do this G or Micarta something super tough G would be better. I am willing to bet you could make choppers like this that would stand up no problem tbh. So even though  in my max depth I have designs I am going to be making shortly that are  thatll work out just fine with my tang extensions. You gotta be able to grind steel square to do this!

The EnZo has Sv or D steel choice of flat or scandi grinds and carbon fiber or sculpted micarta handles. Spyderco has a lot of great knives at around that price point the Manix  Centofante Para  CF Chaparral etc. but the EnZo gives you more knife in less space than any of them and better suits my own aesthetic and functional tastes  I think a narrower blade read not wide amp leafshaped is more agile in the kitchen and works better at more things daytoday. The EnZos blade has a subtly dropped point that retains a lot of strength at the tip while still being very pointy. Also the fit amp finish is up there with the best Taichung Spydercos  its rumored to be manufactured in the same facility in fact.The Birk folder just gets all the details right. Its the perfect size its got simple exceptional ergonomics the knife flicks open effortlessly the thumbstuds stay out of the way while cutting and sharpening and the clip is one of my alltime favorites deep carry with countersunk screws so it doesnt snag.  And other than the Cold Steel Finn Wolf its the only folding knife I know of that comes in a true scandi grind.

5906624,0,t1_cxtvyqu,Are you sure? Because Ive seen a good amount of videos where people baton with folders and it often leads to permanent lock failure. If you put your hand on the folders handle like you do on a fixed blade the lock essentially becomes the fulcrum and it takes the brunt of the force when you whack the spine with a piece of wood. Most locks cant handle that sort of abuse and bend.  I do agree with the last part though I think the only reason why some knives fail the test is because the sudden shock makes the lock jump out of the locked position briefly. If you simply press hard on the spine it should not fold on you.,knifeclub,cxtw3uz,3,t5_2ulfn

6036821,0,t3_3y5oi4,Yes it is but youll have to match the current angle on your knives. What I mean by that is if you dont have an exact  degree angle it wont be hitting the edge and as a result not be really effective. So youd have to use the stones and freehand to match your angle. As long as you hit the angle add a strop to the mixcardboard leather whatever and youll get some really nice edges. Id really suggest getting small dmt coarse xc stone and stropping compound though. A small DMT is not really expensive and will be all you need for reprofiling. You can lay it againt your lansky system and it will give you a pretty even  degree reprofiled edge. Once its reprofiled move up with the stones you already have. Then use your strop. This is essentially what I did. My sharpmaker was not cutting it hur hur so I got a stropman strop with compound and a dmt coarse stone and went to work. Results are really nice mirror edges. ,knifeclub,cyaxvbu,1,t5_2ulfn

6170454,0,t3_402w28,Decided to carry the Spyderco Gayle Bradley  today along with the Spyderco Streat Beat. First time carrying these two together and theyre making a fantastic pair!I loved the GB but for me the GB is an easier carry with it being lighterslimmer and having better ergos for my hand. Plus how can you not love M! Im really liking the direction Mr. Bradley and Spyderco went with this second variation but I can see how some will still prefer the GB over the . I also appreciate the blade shape and length on the  more than the .Ive been pineing after a street beat for a while now and now that I have one I couldnt be happier! Wasnt sure if itd be for me since ive never edcd a fixed on my belt before but I have to say this knife is surprisingly unubtrusive and very comfortable to carry I barely notice its there due to its size and weight. Feels incredible in hand due to the contoured micarta scales and that awesome choil. The jimping on the spine of the knife is also damn near perfect in my opinion.

6177746,0,t1_cyrlqw8,Not sure if you got a good answer to this or not.   Rockstead knives from Japan have figured out a way to make their steels go to harnesses well beyond other knife companies but at the same time not be brittle.   They then are hand built and mirror polished wet sanded from  grit up to  grit. The edge is then mirror polished in a proprietary process.   Under a microscope the edge has no micro serrations and that combined with their extremely hard steels results in not only a sharp knife but one that stays sharp even under extreme use.   Rockstead says with normal frequent use you dont have to sharpen it for  years.   There are many tests on youtube showing how crazy the blade is.    cardboard cuts still slices phonebook paper like a laser.   The drawback is that you cant sharpen it yourself and get that edge you need to send it back to rockstead in Japan.   Their knives are simple elegant and quite expensive.,knifeclub,cyrug73,7,t5_2ulfn

Ive got a CF that I deassisted and it flipped pretty poorly due to having a weak detent. Putting my finger on the frame then pulling through the flipper tab causes a little snapping effect that makes the blade deploy consistently.

6780144,0,t3_48mr12,I love my Ontario Knives RATs. Recently I came across the Ganzo copy of the RAT with the Axis style lock and picked one up on Amazon for .. I really enjoy the Sanrenmu Ganzo and Land knives. They are inexpensive and the build quality is pretty good for what you pay. Sure it is  and they will likely not perform as well as a more expensive knive but they also dont come with the worry of loss or ruination that carrying a nice expensive blade comes with either.Anyhow I posted up the picture with the measurements and a couple of comparison shots with a RAT I and II. The Ganzo GM is a bit smaller than the RAT I by about a half an inch. The reduction in size comes from both the blade and handle. It of course uses the Axis style lock instead of a liner lock. The clip is only two position tip up only on the Ganzo vs  position on the RAT I. Lastly the steel is of course  on the Ganzo vs AUS on the RAT.The Ganzo is a nice knife for the money if you can look past the likely unlicensed Axis style lock and the low grade blade steel.,knifeclub,d0ktap0,7,t5_2ulfn

7126046,0,t3_4d4sey,Love my north fork its a small knife that feels much more substantial in the hand. The recurve is very slight but as another person said it gives it a good belly. Full liners makes it very solid vs the hollow feel of the mini grip excluding the new g mini grip. Not sure I could see it carving very well but EDC is great out door use for sure I plan to use it to clean my deer this year. Also I like it well enough to own . A mini grip with the g scales is a very solid knife would be better for carving with the right blade. But the feeling small may bother you but a lot of large handed people like smaller knives. You need to try to handle them somewhere to get the feel for them. Full size grip is to big for my liking but my father in law really enjoys it because of the larg feel.,knifeclub,d1o5edg,1,t5_2ulfn

Open the blade slightly until you see the detent hole in the tang and put a tiny amount of oil in it. That will make a big difference right away and it will break in to feel normal in a few days. ,knifeclub,d1oufl3,2,t5_2ulfn

7341317,0,t1_d2a7j1r,It definitely does depend on the knife. Ideologically you should never pry with a knife. However with designs like the ZT   BM etc you will realize that you can get away with quite a lot before those knifes will even think of getting any damage from light prying. Most  fixed blades will let you get away with quite a lot or prying as well before they will ever come close to breaking.All this being said if you have a pry bar handy then use it. If not then use what you have if you have to. If you want a onesizedoesitall toolknife then you will more than likely be giving up some cutting ability as a trade off for lateral toughness in a knife that will let you get away with prying with less risk of failing. Also be aware that if the blade snaps while prying you may get injured by flying blade debris if you arent wearing any protective gear. At the end of the day I still pry with my knives but only certain ones and only under certain circumstances.,knifeclub,d2cnotz,1,t5_2ulfn

7463693,0,t3_4hl4tz,The Kwaiken is definitely good but the flipper is smooth with no jimping so it takes a little getting used to for deployment. For the ZT once youve swapped out the pocket clip for a deep carry clip the lockbar is less of a problem.Both flip hard and fast with the Kwaiken having the better blade geometrybelly size and shape imo.To me the ZT is the clear winner. The kwaiken doesnt have a lockbar insert and theres loads of reports of the lockbar wearing in really quick. The kwaiken is also tremendously heavier and the ergos are a little bit of like a sawn off stick. But its an amazing looker I have to say. Ill take it out just to look at it from time to time but Ill probably never take it out for a walk.

At  you should either be getting hyper precice machining of high end materials Chris Reeve or complex milling of high end materials Lion Steel SRTi or a mid tech Olamic . The max hits none of these boxes its just a knife made by a low end brand with nice steel. There is no crazy machining a custom maker isnt overseeing production they used cheap handle materials and as far as I know it isnt made hyper precise like a CRK. Few of the things that inflate production costs are here. For the same price you could get a integral titanium frame lock with beautiful machining and good steel or you could get a g handled knife with ti liners and good steel. There is no reason to buy Cold Steel at that price with those materials unless youre a hard core fan boy.

8525809,0,t3_4ajrqh,I just bought the HK Axis Mini a MiniGrip and a Spyderco Delica  to try out and pick one to keep. This is my first EDC knife. Out of the box the HK blade has noticeable drag and requires more effort on the first two trials  a wine cork and slicing paper. The other two are much more effective so far.The HK has a buttery smooth motion to flick open or closed which I like the best of the three. The lack of a thumb ramp is not ideal either. I wear Medium sized gloves and I can get my pinky on the tapered end of the handle.I dont really like the backlock of the Delica even though the grip and blade are great so far. I was excited for the HK Axiss specs at minigrip price but so far its just eh. Well see how it goes but if I keep one of the others maybe a fullsized Axis would be good for heavier duty uses like when camping. It is much heavier than the others though.Picture of the  knives Imgur,knifeclub,d67aeu4,1,t5_2ulfn

In order for it to disappear you need to remove a lot of material from the rest of the edge and once its gone its gone for good.

9177514,0,t3_560sa5,The budget was tight this month but Ive had my eye on this guy so... I pulled the trigger. So far its turning out to be a really impressive folder. Ive heard good things about Ganzo and this confirms them. The blade shape is clearly a copy of a Protech TR which I am a big fan of. The edge was mostly evenly ground and razor sharp out of the box. The blade centering was spot on with perhaps a hair favoring towards the nonclip side. The hardware was all heat treat anodized and while its not uniform in color I dig it. The action was a bit rough out of the box but after a bit of work it has smoothed out very nicely. It can be flicked using the thumb studs or opened and closed using the axis lock wrist flick. Its a bit heavier than what I usually prefer but really Im just being nitpicky at this point. The liners are milled out so it certainly could be heavier. The carbon fiber iirc is a single ply over g. It looks pretty nice but is in no way the quality of say ZT carbon fiber. But at this price point I wouldnt expect anything else and for all intents and purposes its quite nice. I have no experience with the c steel that Ganzo uses but Im sure itll stand up to my measly EDC tasks just fine. Overall the size is sufficient I certainly wouldnt want it any larger. Ive included a couple pics of it next to my PM and you can see that theyre fairly similar in size. Overall Im very pleased with this knife. For the price I dont think it can be beat. If youre ok with the knockoff blade shape I certainly recommend picking one up!,knifeclub,d8fbf6j,8,t5_2ulfn

10714819,0,t3_5t9mcs,Hello to all members of knife club I would like to just share a moment of my happiness that occurred last night at about  in the morning.  But first I need to explain myself a little bit.  I started using knives at a young age of about .  I bought my first knife I think when I was around  or it was a crappy Walmart camo knife loved it though.  Id say that my first quality knife I had was at  years old when I visited my uncles house in California I live in NJ and he had given me one knife from his collection.  I had this kick ass at the time Smith amp Wesson anodized blue knife that had  lock back blades one straight edge and one full serrated that opened opposite of each other.  I loved that knife I carried it everywhere until I was about ish and one of the pivot screws fell out and I couldnt find it so I had to put it on my shelf where it still lies to this day  I blame my uncle on my knife addiction now.  After that I had looked into what my next knife would be and after some consideration I thought that the Bm mini griptillion in the blue scales would be a great choice so I got that at around the age of . About  years ago I had lost that knife it was extremely devistating.  So I got a tenacious then a Kershaw zing in orange and so on and so on the collection grew but I always thought of that mini grip. Well low and behold as I was looking for something last night I found it!!!!!! I was almost laughing like a little school girl I was I took it all apart and polished the bushings and oiled everything and it is going to be in my main rotation now right next to now my second favorite the M PMnever thought Id find a knife that would kick this one to second place though.  I just right to share my glorious moment with you guys in my favorite sub.  I hope many people have moments like this soon because Im almost positive most knife people have lost one or  before I was just lucky enough to get mine back! Have a great day knife club! ,knifeclub,ddl5jpx,8,t5_2ulfn

Its interesting that the liners on your RAT  developed spots while the blade hasnt  I assumed the liners were stainless steel.Quite honestly Ive not had any problems with AUS  I just like the sound of better edge retention because the RAT would be used longer and for harder tasks. I guess its no harder to wipe a bit of oil on the blade sometimes than it would be to resharpen a blade as far as maintenance is concerned. So far then Im still leaning toward the D.

I may give that setup a try with the chaparral first instead.  Watching video reviews Ive seen it is easier than I thought to close one handed.  I know Im going to get a nirvana soon so between that and the efficient I should be covered in the medium to larger sized blades.  The chaparral will make a nice smaller edc that combines what I like about the sage and the native into one knife along with a nice thin ctsxhp blade.

11270417,0,t1_df9fpgv,Because OP removed his comment while I was typing here is my stance for anyone interested. It should not be an issue because nobody did a thing that was wrong. Nobody wanted to hurt your feelings I doubt more than a couple of people even know what you are talking about.Looking it up it seems to only be used as a slur in the United Kingdom. Very few subscribers here are from the UK. The posters above were not from the UK were not referencing people and were using the shortened form of the word Pakistani. You can believe this is an issue all you want but implying that our subreddit tolerates the use of slurs isnt going to fly with me. Because a tiny subset of the subscriber base considers some usages of this word offensive in certain outside contexts it is not going to lead to a policy or rule being put into place restricting the use of that word. It was the shortening of the word Pakistani. Some people type casually and dont spell out full words. This is a fairly casual informal hangout. There is absolutely no history here of toleration of derogatory terms whatsoever. To suggest otherwise is flat wrong and easily disproven. ,knifeclub,df9hh8m,2,t5_2ulfn
