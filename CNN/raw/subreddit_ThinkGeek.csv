2887198,0,t3_2t4460,You are part of a huge group of people that they screwed up orders on that were placed around black friday early december. Youre better off calling their support line. When I finally reached someone they informed me that they had lost my order between it being packaged and UPS receiving it. They offered to ship what they could but two items were no longer in stock. I told them to refund everything. I saw a few other people complain and they got gift cards but I dont want to do business with them anymore so I didnt push for that. Good luck.,ThinkGeek,cnw9ztk,1,t5_2rn4l
