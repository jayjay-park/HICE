4760700,0,t3_3g05sq,Deep learning refers to having a hierarchical stack of models on top of each other each of which uses the output of the previous layer to produce another intermediate result that is a little closer to what we want to get. This is in contrast to shallow models that only do a single albeit very complicated transformation of input to output. Hierarchicallayered approaches work very well in computer vision because images are made up of objects which are made up of parts which are made up of edges... So having a succession of highly specialized models detect ever more complicated features is a much more practical approach than trying to have one model detect everything from raw pixel values. Currently this is almost always done with manylayered neural networks but there is also growing interest in deep graphical models. ,MLQuestions,ctumq1g,1,t5_30rel

7168071,0,t1_d1rw6a8,Thanks so much! It took me almost an hour to figure out what question to ask. Your answer made me decide to try the Coursera ML program and that MNIST article was really enlightening.Im an embedded programmer so Im mainly trying to get a feel for the computational requirements of applying a machinelearningbased solution. It would be a shame to dive in and spend a bunch of time learning how to use ML only to find out that I need a fullblown quad core desktop CPU to do anything with it.edit not that Ive confirmed that I could run an ML algorithm on an MCU but this has given me enough hope to start investigating on my own ,MLQuestions,d1sxx5f,1,t5_30rel

In the first example theta  .theta   So y will always be . no matter what.In the second example theta is now . so whatever x is y  x.Im sure you get it by now too lazy to do example points.Cheers.,MLQuestions,d2b5tzl,2,t5_30rel

7907638,0,t1_d44id2k,I see. Well your network is probably set up to minimize a loss function so its behavior is straightforward. Whatever dataset you choose it will minimize the loss for that dataset. In my experience its often better to use as much data as possible even if one class is overrepresented but you could also use class weights so that you take smaller training steps for the class you have more of.,MLQuestions,d44w6bf,1,t5_30rel

9003427,0,t1_d7tip4x,About LabelEncoding even though I give each ingredient an id for each data point I have a set of ingredients. And that set need not have same cardinality for each data point. So that would give me a set of numerical IDs. How can I deal with that?,MLQuestions,d7u2lvo,1,t5_30rel
9179201,0,t3_561m4o,In a normal linear regression problem you can derive the formula for the exact gradient given all the datapoints. The gradient tells you the direction of where the cost function is growing so you just need to put a  minus in front of it and you will be following the direction in which the cost function gets smaller. Just iterate this step of following the gradient by updating the parameters every time and getting a new gradient from the new parameter position. At some point the direction from the negative gradient will clearly point towards the same area and the gradient will get smaller and smaller. That will be the global minimum.,MLQuestions,d8fj48e,1,t5_30rel
9287919,0,t3_57jcbu,If by student budget you mean you are actually a student or just recently graduated then theres a chance emailing a few GPU acceleration labs at schools that have some sort of relationship to your school might yield some sort of success for getting you remote access to a cluster or good advice for buyingusing AWS from people who do it professionally.Also consider saving the problem of investing in hardware until youve used up all of your AWS credits and you might learn something more in the meantime and the code you write will not go away.,MLQuestions,d8tb6tj,2,t5_30rel

I imagine youd get even better results by normalising the prices to have a mean of zero and a variance of .Edit a word,MLQuestions,datbqmp,2,t5_30rel

11043618,0,t3_5xoxtf,Maybe try a random search approach? I.e. select random ranges with different sizes and look which one works best for you.Otherwise maybe this paper about weight decay estimation is of any help to you. Sorry if this is no direct answer to your question but as I am fairly inexperienced with applying machine learning myself linking those might help you more than me just guessing a solution for you ,MLQuestions,dejrwip,2,t5_30rel
11470369,0,t3_63pdbn,It depends on the amount of iterations you are running.  If youre doing a batch size of  and  iteration then the model has seen a total of  samples.  If youre doing a batch size of  and  iterations  then it has seen  samples.  Make sense? ,MLQuestions,dfw5sln,1,t5_30rel
