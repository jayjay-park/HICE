312857,0,t3_1xn6xw,well you can have it welded up but that will require taking the bottom end apart since no shop I can think of will tig near oil like that. You can probably for not too much money just buy a used complete engine and swap it in. you MAY be able to find a good bottom end on ebay and swap over your top youd need a couple of gaskets and maybe studs but it wouldnt be that hard. just make sure you torque everything down to the correct values.,Fixxit,cfd734v,5,t5_2sti8
312951,0,t3_1xnvki,Drain the brake fluid. If you have an air compressor with an air gun nozzle stick it into the Banjo fitting the place where the brake line attaches to the caliper and blow the air in. This air pressure will pop the pistons out. Be sure you have something to catch the pistons.Replace the piston seals too.I dont know about the best way to order brake lines but I do know it is much better to get braided brake lines. They are more durable than the rubber ones. ,Fixxit,cfd7fsr,1,t5_2sti8

478379,0,t3_1zkhb0,So heres the way to decode the DOT number to get date of manufacture. That being said just replace the damn things. Yes I know its going to be like  but...  . If you blow out you go down and thats going to cost a shit ton more than  in hospital bills and repairs to the bike.  . The rubber hardens with age. Sidewall cracks are a good indication that the tire is hardening up and that means that you dont have the grip you used to have. Less grip  more chance of you going down.In a car its easier to ignore this type of thing. If a tire blows you very well may just be inconvenienced if you are unlucky you get in a crash and get hurt. On a bike its almost a guarantee that you crash. So just bite the bullet and get a new set of shoes.In closing the cracks themselves are not that bad but they are indicative of something worse.,Fixxit,cfun7v3,2,t5_2sti8
491528,0,t1_cfw3szr,You know it could be the rings a compression test would tell you for sure. Smoking a little on startup then starting to run cleaner makes me think that while its been sitting oil has had the chance to seep down through the valve guides. Im not even sure Id qualify it as a reliability issue as it wont ruin the engine. To me reliability means unburstability and Ive never yet heard of anyone being stranded by any iteration of the Triump Triple!With the top end off its not hard to have a look at the rings and its probably worth doing while youre in there.And there are no dumb questions.

553152,0,t3_20gr83,Yes the engine will run on one pair of cylinders if only one coils is affected and this can be useful for diagnosis. I had to do this last summer on my Daytona  which would run but only pull to about  on two cylinders.Work out which two exhaust pipes are getting hot to confirm which pair are sparking. Now swap the lowtension leads between the coils and at the same time swap the high tension leads between  and  or you can just remove the coils and swap them in to the other position leaving all the wiring as normal. Run the test again. If the other two pipes get hot you know that one of the coils is bad. If on the other hand the same two pipes get hot then both coils are ok and the problem is elsewhere.Assuming that its not a coil problem it could be on the low tension side or the plugs. Work though in the following order to minimise cost. Check and clean the low tension connection to the coil.  Check continuity to the CDI connection. Check and clean the lowtension output connection of the CDI. Use contact cleaner for this and if possible avoid sanding it off. The connectors on bikes are usually tinplated sometimes over iron rather than copper and if you abrade that the connectors will corrode faster. Change both the affected plugs . Even if only one of the plugs is bad it will affect both cylinders.  If your CDI has physical contacts clean and gap them. Check the timing.I f its still not sparking its probably the CDI.,Fixxit,cg35exj,2,t5_2sti8

That is part  according the fiche it is holding part  to part . Part  from what I can tell is providing the tension.

869634,0,t3_242win,Try using a tender to charge your battery up.  Then try starting with a new battery.  Then try bumpstarting to see if your bike works.  If bumpstarting works your plugs are fine etc...If your bike works with bumpstarting then youve at least narrowed it down that your bike works and your issues is with starting.  If it is running check the voltage and see if it is charging the battery. I had to resurrect a broken ninja which wouldnt start and after replacing the battery it still made clicking noises.  Bumpstarting the bike  bike ran fine.  It also was charging the battery over  V when engine was running.  The cable going to the starter looked fried and after other diagnostics it turned out it was a bad starter motor easy to buy and swap a new one in.The clicking noise sounds like solenoid is fine though but you never know.I fixed my bike basically the bike had lojack which slowly drained the battery  died.  Hence the bike sat for awhile and when owner used a new battery the carbs were likely clogged from sitting too long.  The mistake the owner made  was to keep pressing the starter with a gunked up carb which eventually fried the starter motor.  If your bike has gunky carbs then no matter how much you keep trying to crank  bad idea.  Anyway he sold me a beautiful ninja  with k worth of mods for  and after I put in a new battery cleaned carbs and a starter motor I flipped it for x the value ,Fixxit,ch34r97,1,t5_2sti8

After the mix hits  gasoline it becomes a potential bomb. So if it leaks say a quarter ounce of gas each time and that gets past the rings it will build each shutdown.

If you have bought a new needle jet or needle are you sure you have the right size and have positioned the needle in the correct notch?Looking at the spark tells you a little  basically the electrics are running in some form. However it doesnt usually tell you how well the ignition is working. There are things like spark gap testers which will do that but they dont usually fit bike plug covers. More importantly your bike is easier to test with the method I described.Dont buy a compression tester until youve checked the other stuff. Do the tests systematically  that means in the order given. Dont jump ahead to what you think might be the problem because you will waste time and money.

3523093,0,t3_30mc0n,Motorcycle owners manuals will recommend installing spark plugs one heat range hotter if youre doing a lot of slow riding and the engine tends to carbon foul the plugs.The same manual will recommend installing spark plugs one heat range colder if youre doing a lot of high speed riding and your stock spark plugs insulator noses are bone white after a long ride using lots of throttle and high RPM.I dont have a Ninja  owners manual so I dont know what the standard heat range is but I can tell you from bitter experience what happens when you run spark plugs that are too hot for your application.Yes the engine will run very hot as the ground electrodes glow cherry red and cause the fuel air mixture to preignite before the ignition system sends a electrical voltage to the plugs.Normal ignition advance may be  to  degrees before top dead center on the compression stroke but preignition is NOT normal it can occur  degrees before top dead center.If your engine is mildly preigniting from using the wrong heat range spark plugs you might hear a tinkling sound like a few valves need adjusting.If you pull the plugs out and look carefully at the insulator nose you may see little black specks that look like pepper.Thats not too bad its just carbon thats come loose from the combustion chamber and its warning you that your spark plugs are too hot for the fuel air mixture.If you see little silvery balls of aluminum stuck to the insulator nose thats strike two!Thats aluminum throwoff from the top of the piston as the preignition tires to burn holes in your pistons.I have personally seen spark plugs that were full of melted aluminum from running too hard with lean fuel air mixture and the wrong spark plugs.In one extreme case on a race bike the spark plugs burned a hole completely through the piston top and the overheated piston seized and a connecting rod broke.The engine had been overheating all morning and was making terribly groaning sounds before our teams main rider took the bike out for a qualifying.No way was that machine going to survive a six hour endurance race while preigniting like that. ,Fixxit,cptuw9y,2,t5_2sti8

4131995,0,t3_37zw1r,Lets do it the hard way and look at it logically There are going to be two circuits in those three wires The Riding light circuit positive  The Brake light circuit positive  The Ground for both circuits The Riding light circuit is going to be from the key ignition and illuminates the bulb whenever the bike is On.  The Brake light circuit is going to be from the brake footpedal switch and handlebar brake lever switch and illuminates the bulb whenever the brakes are applied.Use a multimeter or a lightbulb to determine which is which. Ill use a brake lightbulb for this example. The bulb has two contacts on the bottom one is for the Riding circuit and the other is for the Brake circuit. There is no technical difference between the two. Brake light bulbs are merely two lighting filaments in one glass package. If you turn the bike On one filament lights hit the brakes and the second filament lights producing twice the brightness.The brass body of the bulb is the Ground.For identifying the three wires coming from the bike not the brake light housing. With the bike On touch a wire to the brass of the bulb and another wire to either of the contacts on the bulb bottom until you find two wires that light up the bulb. Those two are your Ground wire and your Riding light wires.. Find which of those two is the Riding light circuit by touching the brass of the bulb against an unpainted bare metal part of the bike frame or the negative battery terminal and touch in turn one of the two wires to a contact on the bulb and note which one lights the bulb up. Mark that wire as Riding. Mark the other wire as Ground.. Mark the third wire as Brake. If you touch this wire to a contact the bulb should only turn on when you press the brake lever or pedal. If it doesnt do this you have an electrical fault in your braking circuit that will need to be deborked.For identifying the three wires coming from the brake light housing you really only need to find the Ground wire. The other two just go to the two filaments inside the bulb. With the bulb inserted into its socket in the brake light housing and visible to you. Attach your nowknown Ground wire to one of the three housing wires. . Touch your nowknown Riding wire to a second wire and see if ONE filament only illuminates. If it does try touching the Riding wire to the third wire and see if THE OTHER filament only illuminates. If they did congratulations! You found the ground wire on your first shot! Mark the first housing wire as Ground plug everything together and happy trails to you. If not. Move the Ground wire to the second wire and touch the Riding wire to the other two wires in turn. If each wire lights up ONLY ONE filament congratulations! You found the Ground wire plug everything together and happy trails to you. If not. Move the Ground wire to the third wire. The other two wires should light up ONE filament ONLY.Basically if the Ground wire is in the WRONG position the other two wires will light up either a single filament or both filaments. If the Ground wire is in the CORRECT position the other two wires will only light up a single filament each... and happy trails to you.If it does anything else you have an electrical issue with your brake light housing which will need to be deborked. Check for corrosion in the bulb socket.,Fixxit,crr9s0f,2,t5_2sti8

4851925,0,t1_cu5gvbl,gtgtQuick question for you.There are NO quick answers since setting up the front fork is a matter of trial and error and it is usually a VERY messy job because of the fork oil covering everything.I recommend going by what feels good to you and educating yourself by reading everything you can find on forks especially damper rod forks.Kevin Cameron technical editor of Cycle World wrote a book on sportbike technology and explained how damper rod forks work and their drawbacks.Air assist allows the use of weaker front springs and relies upon the air above the fork oil being compressed to act as an air spring.The volume of air above the oil is important and at a minimum the oil should just barely cover the top of the piston on the damper rod.More oil means less air and a more sudden increase in air pressure and possibly a harsher ride.Another problem with air assist on bikes built in the s was that the air would cause the fork seals to constrict on the stanchion tubes and the rider would notice a loss of fork compliance.I would always run about  PSI in my GSs forks but then I decided to try stiffer springs and heavier fork oil so I installed a set of Progressive fork springs.Little did I know that Progressive manufacturesgeneric springs that will fit in the fork tubes of many different motorcycles.The instruction sheet that came with my springs didnt mention that fact at all nor did it advise me what the exact level of fork oil should be.I also installed a set of Progressive springs in my GSXRs forks in an attempt to reduce front end dive due to really weak front springs.Again the generic nature of the springs jumped up and bit me on the ass.The Progressive springs fit a variety of motorcycles with the same diameter fork tubes and these springs stick out of the fork tubes about  inches so any time I have to work on the front end I have to compress these longer springs  inches just to get them into the fork stanchion tubes.And Progressive said nothing about the level of oil in the tubes so the first time I installed the recommended volume of oil I encountered hydraulic locking when I stroked the forks only half of their advertised travel!WTF? I had to guesstimate how much oil to install in my forks.Progressive has posted an online .pdf file about how to set up forks but its still a matter of trial and error to find that sweet set up where the forks are initially compliant but dont allow excessive front end dive...,Fixxit,cu64dj4,2,t5_2sti8

This may be as simple as hooking up a jumper wire to the dealer service connector which is probably under the seat. You just might have a throttle position switch which isnt making good contact. The ECM is supposed to cause the fuel injectors to stay open longer when the throttle is twisted but the ECM also takes information from other sensors into account.,Fixxit,cxrry7r,2,t5_2sti8

6516976,0,t3_44whna,the sprocket looks ok the teeth are still in the correct shape and not starting to hook. As for the chain it looks like its a bit loose and has some stiff links in it.the front sprocket will always wear faster than the rear and the chain will usually require replacement before the sprockets. however its recomended that you replace all  as a set.So check the wear limit on your chain usualy stated as a maximum distance over a certain number of links when pulled by a certain weight.OR do what most people do and when you cant move the wheel back any further to adjust it its time for a chain and sprocket kit...Edit best thing to clean your chain is old rag and parrafin kerosene bit of parrafin on the rag and give it a good wipe.

6523684,0,t3_44yz94,Yes KampL rebuild kits are definitely decent but without looking at which out it your carbs it will be up to you to make sure they have what you need.

And of course upon reassembly make sure to consult the manual on proper float level adjustment.

9127314,0,t3_5578rt,You are doing what every newby does you are tackling your problem by picking the hardest least likely tasks as your first port of call.  If your starter clutch is faulty your engine will not turn over just get a whizzing noise when you press the button.  The fact you cant bumpstart it pretty well rules that out anyway.  One thing before moving on.... dont use fully synthetic oil or any oil not specifically designed for stroke aircooled motorcycle engines not even scooter oil.  The wrong oil will prevent the starter clutch gripping and also make the proper clutch slip as well.  Pull out the spark plugs attach them to their leads and lean them against the metal of the engine where you can see them.  Make sure they are ALL touching metal not just some.  Have you got a nice fat spark ?Were the plugs wet or dry when you took them out ?  Is your kill switch by the throttle in the ON position ?   Is your sidestand down and in doing so preventing you starting it ?  Is the fuel turned on... enough of the stuff in the tank ?  At this point you will know whether you are a forgetful fellow and not checked the basics before trying to start also whether fuel is getting to the engine and if there is a spark present to light it with.  So far from needing to strip the  wretched engine into bits you can tackle the real much simpler problem .,Fixxit,d88ydei,2,t5_2sti8

9264361,0,t1_d8q30er,Ok this is actually good news. The bike was already buggered but now you probably know what is wrong. It is possible that a short in the starter motor dropped the voltage low enough for the ignition to fail to spark so you might be looking at the root cause here. Its worth trying a jump start from a car to be complete but the next useful step will be to measure the resistance across the start motor terminals. I hope you can find the right value somewhere but if not the specified value for a different bike should be in the right ball park. Ill see if I can find figures for some of my bikes when I get home. This may lead to having to replace the starter motor but at least you will know that its definitely broken. BTW it was a good idea to remove that pinion for the test to isolate the motor. ,Fixxit,d8qbo0g,1,t5_2sti8

10467352,0,t3_5pudov,Year make model? Different manufacturers use different color codes for the wire on the Ignition Bus.The Ignition Bus isnt a yellow school bus electrical engineers use the term bus to designate the source of power for multiple electrical loads.Suzuki uses orange wires to designate the ignition bus.Power goes from the battery through the main fuse and on to the ignition switch.The main fuse is often located on  the starter solenoid in modern design practice.Power from the switch goes to the ignition fuse and goes from there back to the handlebars and the kill switch and the starter switch.Power from the ignition switch will also feed multiple fuses that supply the fuel pump headlight and other accessories.Japanese motorcycles typical have an ignition switch with a set of contacts that send power to the ignition bus and a second set of contacts that send power to the tail light so it can be left on all night when parked on the street in Japan.If you connect your USB charger to the tail light wire and expect the battery in your laptop or whatever to charge up but you accidentally leave the ignition switch in the park position you may discharge your battery completely overnight.Youre better off to hook your USB charger to the ignition bus.,Fixxit,dcukxkn,1,t5_2sti8

Sometimes for really stuck ones a few not so gentle taps with a rubber mallet on a shifter that is already being forced into the direction of a shift also works.  ,Fixxit,dfzi8al,1,t5_2sti8

11625011,0,t3_65vm0m,gtgt And when it was up on the stand I fired it up and put in in first and sure enough the rear wheel was spinning even with the clutch all the way in pretty damn fast too.Can you say viscous friction?The oil coating the clutch disks has a fair amount of friction and it causes the plates to stick together so the transmission spins and transmits a small amount of power with the clutch lever pulled in.If first gear doesnt make a lound clunk! when you put it in gear its not too bad.AAMOF the clutch on my  SVSF releases so far it stops driving the rear wheel when I shift gears and the bike heads for the outside of the curve Im inbecause of the steering geometry change.I had to adjust the clutch release mechanism so it doesnt disengage quite so far.Hydraulic clutches are nonabjustable and all you can do it bleed the air out.I had a lot of trouble changing the clutch fluid on my GSXR and what I finally did to get all the air out of the system was to unbolt the slave cylinder and push the piston back as far as it would go to push the air back up to the master cylinder.Then I pumped slowly on the clutch lever with the master cylinder reservour cap off.A slug of air came back up the clutch hose and splattered brake fluid on the paint.So its a good idea to cover painted parts with a sheet of plastic before bleeding the brakes this way.Sounds like the clutch is operating fairly normally to me.,Fixxit,dgdpgbp,1,t5_2sti8
