7902121,0,t1_d440xus,This is exactly the post of what I meant when many MexicanAmericans mistaken for Hispanic Latino Spanish and Mexican as all the same thing and also shows what I mean when a large proportion MexAmericans seem ignorant of their own country when compared to Puerto Ricans Salvadorian Americans etc.For example most of Dominica are black. The Iberian implant is so little as its virtually nonexistent outside of the landowning class or upperclass or whatever equivalent of aristocracy and mestes.  A large proportion of Argentinians are nonIberian European immigrants many being of Italian descent in the main places and some of the smaller towns being of German descent. With little Iberian and indigenous DNA in most current descendents outside of those who immigrated to towns with strong Spanish or Indian influences.Dont even get me started with the friendliness towards each other. In the major Hispanic hubcenters in America gang wars breakout and many gangs are formed consisting solely or mostly out of one specific identity such as the mostly Salvadorian MS Mexican drug dealers etc. These gangs are so racist they are even actually more brutal towards other Hispanics who arent of the same nationality than towards whites and blacks. Im not saying that genuine Hispanic unity exist but even than many Peruvians identify of Peruvian first many Ecuadorians as Ecuadorians first etc and unless there is a pressing need to unit such as to protest racist white legislations most Cubans will put the immigrants of Cuba before Cuba first and so on.However as I note from my experience many Mexican Americans dont seem to have this Im from Costa Rica so Costa Ricans go first Im from Nicaragua so the Nicaraguan community goes first and literally believe that Cubans will always help out Mexicans etc because they think Hispanics are the SAME GROUP.,LatinoPeopleTwitter,d449uce,1,t5_3913r
