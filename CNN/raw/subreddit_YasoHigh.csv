Shirous attempt to calm her down seemed only to irritate her further.And youre definitely smarter than that so Im not going to just accept the idea that you somehow forgot. In other words you deliberately kept information from me.Mei looks at Kiyoshi.Why the hell are we even being secretive about any of this? Why not share information? Why bother trying to sneak around each other when were all just trying to figure out the same thing? Whatever its not you who Im blaming its this guy...She turns back to Shirou.Who pretty much betrayed me by not telling me a damn thing. Awesome. Makes me feel great.

He cant advance on his own. And its only May. His level of deduction is months ahead..Im not saying Namatame is in it Im saying Makoto has basically named him.As for your facts..If he doesnt wish to kill them why throw them into a deathtrap? Its known to kill people. To say he doesnt wish to kill them when they only survive because other people came to help is absurd.Victims are thrown in. Everyone thrown in so far is a student. It wouldnt be hard to follow them home from school. If you know theyre a student going to school is a very easy way to track them. Did they actually get testimony from the victims describing the kidnapping? You dont know how long it was between being attacked and thrown in. You can suggest it but to state it as if it were the only logical conclusion is a load of crap. If he had a truck like that he may so well knock them out and put them in the back.
