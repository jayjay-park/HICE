Generally vocals are dead center sometimes a little off center and other instruments might be panned left or right in the mix. Bass is obviously a low frequency so with stereo image capture software you can get just the bass line by isolating the lower portion of the mix. ,SongStems,d93hvju,1,t5_2v88q

11214035,0,t1_df2y10k,Worth mentioning that sourcing video games means you run the risk of losing tracks at the mercy of the games audio engineers and you will always get wet vocals and your standard  mixdown tracks. If they dont like how the echoreverb on the keys sounds muddy on your average kiddie gamers tinny tv speakers say theyre liable to recreate the keys with software if a dry key stem isnt available. This is the case with Im Blues RB rip. The keys stem lost its wet dreamy quality.This is what you get if you somehow manage to get the label to send you the stems. They also send you a floating point cue file thing to line up the samples. Who knows how those get leaked perhaps a public directory slipup.,SongStems,df33ixp,1,t5_2v88q
