9692630,0,t3_5dedyr,This is the reason I rolled the version I have back before they got intrusive. I just dont update anymore.,TerrariumTV,da7tm7a,1,t5_3ei8x
9706415,0,t3_5e1lv4,I dont mind ads  I mind them when the developer is willing to sacrifice usability for it. If you cant effectively get a paid version out soon or at least reduce the ads to a minimum expect an adfree version.I hate to sound like a dick and I will always support developers but I when youve let ads get so bad that it ends up causing your application to crash or consume as much as half the resources on the phone then someone needs to do something to mitigate that.,TerrariumTV,da9iv7o,8,t5_3ei8x
9942965,0,t1_db3lc44,gtHow to Download to Your MicroSD Card Within Terrarium TV App gtgtHere I attempt to explain how to download to your microSD card within the Terrarium TV app on your Android device. I am using a BLU Life One X  phone I got for  on Amazon as its the only device I have that takes a microSD card and it only has GB RAM so it will most likely be slower than your newer flagship smartphones or tablets. So please bear with me.gt Willie D. Washington in Gaminggt views since Sep bot inforyoutubefactsbotwikiindex,TerrariumTV,db3lcc7,1,t5_3ei8x

11675798,0,t1_dgjg386,Yes. My primary issue with showbox is that you cant sync favs. I switch between phone and tablet and TTV allows me to do that via Trakt. Also showbox doesnt have p and sometimes sources are slow. MoviedHD has  but its not reliable. It stopped working for me. ,TerrariumTV,dgjgv14,6,t5_3ei8x
