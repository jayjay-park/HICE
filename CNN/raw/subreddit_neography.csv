212621,0,t3_1wd9qf,i kept looking around the internet and eventually found this helpful post on the linguistics stackexchange i still need to track down the cited bookspapers but the key resource provided was this database  which seems to contain much of the information i was hoping to find. if anyone else is looking for phonetic statistics this is a very useful database.,neography,cf2nutj,1,t5_2rjr2

3084921,0,t3_2vgerm,One thing to remember is you dont have to have as many glyphs as there are sounds.  That would be really inefficient way to do it.Take the english version of the latin alphabet.  English has more vowel sounds than  and more consonant sounds than .Think about the s  the djh sound in invaSion and the voiceless s in possum.  English readers dont get confused because not all sounds exist in the same settings.  So when a reader sees the s before ion they know it almost always makes one sound while in another environment it makes another.We also just have to memorize pronunciations too in some cases.So you might first try to count up how many distinct sound environments there are maybe sort them with a histogram or something and then if its a small number just reuse an approximate glyph to cover both.,neography,cohr15k,1,t5_2rjr2

5224015,0,t3_3lv04j,Graph paper. I almost always start by looking at existing scripts say on Omniglot.com or AncientScripts.com  sometimes I capture them as a graphic then reverse or flip or both the graphic so I am seeing the shapes from a different perspective. Then I hit the graph paper. I draw shapes that are as distinct as I can and I stick to the lines to keep things consistent. Once I have a look and a design that I like  well then I hit the font software and make a font. ,neography,cvfoog5,1,t5_2rjr2

8585658,0,t1_d6ebsgb,This is INCREDIBLE and I love it. D Particularly the handandfinger based semantics behind the numbers. I have words for  already chosen based on an earlier phonology along with a special word for  a hand. Taking your concept and working backwards from those with my newer phonotactics would give me names for the fingershands.EDITHere is a rough sketch of a number system adapting your idea. I like the notation you showed but I wanted it to be more personal. These probably wont be written in cursive to help distinguish them from letters.,neography,d6esmf2,1,t5_2rjr2
