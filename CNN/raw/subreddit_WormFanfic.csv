Marquise described it as equivalent exchange because she doesnt copy powers she takes them. In exchange though she boosts another aspect of those same powers. Like telling the shard to redirect energy from point A to point B while QA itself takes on the neglected aspect of power and uses it on its own. gtWhat QA did with Bakuda was basically tell it to stop powering the aspect of buildingengineering and instead focus entirely on the aspect that was for creationdesigning breaking the limits of Bakudas power in that respect and eliminating the other. Hence why she couldnt remember how to build it. Taylor knew how to build it but not how to design it. An arrow without a bow and a bow without an arrow essentially.,WormFanfic,cpn6olg,4,t5_33pt9

5502623,0,t3_3qagj3,Id roll several of your points into a single oneEverything should have a reason for happening both in the context of the storys world and in the context of the story. If youre just going through the paces and dont have any deeper reason to show something skip it or gloss over it. If something makes sense in the context of the world but not in the context of the story gloss over it if it makes sense in the context of the story but not in the context of the world consider whether it really needs to happen or what you would need to change for it to make sense in the context of the world.So if youre writing a locker scene or hitting the stations of canon simply because you feel like you need to you can gloss over it. If the interesting part of the story youre writing begins later on you can play around with the timeline. Its okay to start later as long as youre not skipping anything interesting! Put thought into what happened and maybe reference it when appropriate but dont show things which are boring or arent important to the story youre trying to tell.You can probably skip power testing scenes  its more interesting to see someone using powers during a fight than to read about them trying to figure out their powers. We probably dont need to know precise details even if you need to think about them while youre writing the story. You can probably skip watching a Tinker build their first lab unless theres a really good reason to show that its something that needs to happen but not something that necessarily adds to the story. You dont need to show the locker scene unless there are major divergences or it otherwise genuinely adds to the story.In general if you dont have a good reason to show something dont show it.Writing fanfiction in an established community is complicated because there are a lot of tropes and community standards that have grown up entirely outside of the original work. There are people who write fanfics without having read any of Worm.Some things have been done to death. The locker scene which I think isnt discussed until . in Worm to show how much fanfiction has blown it out of proportion altpowers which dont change anything else about the world and the fight with Lung are the main ones which come to mind. Ive read fics which do all of these things well of course but so so often theyre not done well. Its usually despite these elements that a fic is good rather than because of them.Find beta readers ideally more than one who are familiar with Worm fanfiction.Oh and plan ahead. Have a basic idea of where your story is going and how it will get there. One of the weaknesses of serial fiction is that its hard to go back and change things if you realize that youve made a mistake.,WormFanfic,cwf0fd1,2,t5_33pt9

5678770,0,t1_cx0xlic,Thats the thing isnt it? Its not that theyre good or bad. Its that their actions are both good and bad and we have a hard time coming to terms with that. They do more to help Taylor than anyone else. And what a difference they make in her life! Its incredible how much better off she is. But then theres the racism the hate and the violence. If you were to add up how many lives theyve ruined against all the Taylors of the world that theyve helped the harm almost certainly outweighs the good. But it doesnt work like that. The bad doesnt cancel out the good and the good doesnt invalidate the bad. They are simultaneously guardian angels and terrible monsters.

6143149,0,t3_3ywx0n,Okay. So at the moment category wise weve got AUs Crossovers  Altpowers OCsSIs  OneshotsShorts QuestsIf this is gonna happen again for  I wonder what other categories should be added? A few random ideas from me Best of the subreddit? like a good post or insightful review or a member that contributes greatly or something to do with this sub  NSFW fics? I think theres lots of potential for some great stories featuring explicit content beyond straightup porn though thats good too  Fics that finished this year?  Humourcrackparody?  Best romantic ship in a story?  Overall best fic of X? maybe candidates could be selected based on collated results from the other categories letting people vote between the top few results from each category rather than doing regular nominations like I mention below after the dot points Maybe also have a section for just meta discussion about the year and not for nominees. Somewhere posts like this one can go and somewhere people can post if they arent sure where a certain fic belongs like the Maharal and Copacetic confusion elsewhere in the comments here. As for the actual gathering of votes and whatnot it may be worth having a nomination thread like this and using something like Google Forms for the actual voting. Reduces the chance of data being skewed by virtue of having all options there at the same time rather than requiring people to visit the thread every day to see if theres a new one they want to vote for or whatever. Current system results in later nominees being statistically less likely to garner vote counts as high as earlier nominees. Reddit is also shit as hell with upvote counts. You can literally refresh a page five times in as many seconds and get a different number every time even on archived posts. Its bizarre. Almost makes me think Reddit purposefully fudges the numbers though I dont know why theyd do that. And thats not even mentioning downvotes causing problems as the edit in the OP seems to indicate is an issue. Edit next time round Id also recommend putting the categories and their explanations in the OP. ,WormFanfic,cynwtrl,5,t5_33pt9

Some stories play with your heartstrings like a cello. This one plays them like a freakin banjo. It takes place in Brockton Bay there are original characters it seems to take place a bit after the start of canon and it only has reasonable stuff not a crossover.        Im gonna keep following it.

7410713,0,t3_4gqzdw,In the increasing order The Reaping by Paradocks  This one narrowly made it into the list but I just love the concept of GU!Taylor and the first few chapters with Sophia were especially good before it became just likeable. Dominion by MateriaBlade S!Taylor with Khepri trigger. Consistently good and interesting. Here be Dragons by Ryuugi Taylor with Lungs power and the constant escalation  and I love seeing Eidolon fighting. Reads like a really good thriller. Tree of Knowledge by MateriaBlade  Taylor with the power to communicate with Scion who turns to be her protector. Fantastic idea good execution I wish it updated. Bug on a wire by jacobk  Taylor approaches Shadow Stalker to help her fight crime instead of doing it on her own. Consequential one of the best AUs out there. Perpetuance by Rescind  Taylor with the power inspired by Hawking Radiation. Tragic realistic moving. Cenotaph. by Notes  Fic that doesnt need any explanation the best introduction to the world of Worm FF. A take at a more independed Taylor that loses her father early on. Slaughterhouse Nine Power Taylor by Thinker  Dribbles on Taylor with different powers of Slaughterhouse Nine Team. GrayBoy!Taylor and Shatterbird!Taylor are the best out of bunch but extremely enjoyable with all of them. The Number Girl by Thinker  Dinah! Taylor on a quest to mend her relationship with Emma after the locker through the power of probabilities. Secondbest Thinker Taylor.And finally we come to the final three ElAhrairah by Anderein  I love Thinker Taylors and that one is the best out of all of them. A different kind of Queen Administrator trigger leaves Taylor with ability to see and understand shards with all the implications. Weaver Nine by Thinker  Jack Slash and Taylor Hebert change their places. The Best Endbringer fight. The best exploration of Jacks power and his abilities when used for a good cause. Agent of Cauldron by Zeitchen  the one and only. Best AU. Best Original Character. The fic that makes you think and leaves you feeling like an ant in the face of immense scale of Wormverse and how Brockton Bay was no more than half a percent of Cauldrons concerns.

9496620,0,t3_5ausrt,Well just a few days ago the author of Worm  posted an update to this subreddit.  I havent read it but Ive read Gadget and apparently he wrote that. I couldnt quite immerse myself into Gadget. The quality of the story isnt bad but it didnt click with me. I felt that the plot moved along a little too quickly for my taste. I dont recall there being any downtime between events and arcs. It was mostly chapters of plot progression with the mc and one or two chapters for other characters. Maybe  is paced a bit better because its premise of cape triggering earlier is more open than that of Gadgets which is about a capes daughter who went with her mom instead of her hero father and seeks his careaffection. But I dunno since I havent read .,WormFanfic,d9jnsir,4,t5_33pt9

10064651,0,t3_5jvbl1,We had a recentish thread on the best but it was limited to Taylor altpower fics. Would be nice to have a more generic list though some of it would probably be awful stories.  That said regarding the question as stated...Master it makes me think of something like Taylors canon power not of controlling actual humans or anything like that so Ships Administration  Blaster not sure actually its a bit of an obscure classification maybe that one story where Taylor gets revived with Skyrimstyle Shout powers EDIT The Way of the Voice  Mover if Phage Quest is not allowed due to being recent very unfinished and extremely NSFW EDIT and not really much about the Mover part of the powers anyway then Heromakers Legacy with all the portals... on second thought what was that Flash fic named again? EDIT  Ride the Lightning thanks uerasels!  Shaker thats easy Unnatural Disaster  Thinker cant recall the name now the one where Taylor has actual telepathy and tries to help Canary EDIT  Perspective thanks uerasels!  Tinker that one CYOA SI with a pocketdimension neutronium gyroscope for energy storage  cant recall the name either EDIT  Technology Will Win The Day thanks uNotACauldronAgent! That ending though... Id rather have an incomplete story.  Brute Taylor Varga was the first but it belongs in another category the next one is a scene though not a story  in one of the CYOA SIs the main character is trying to kill an Endbringer and ends up stuck inside it for a while  Striker I cant think of anyone but Amy for this one... if you want a specific story then Really Bad End or maybe Heredity  Changer Taylor Varga of course the infinitely variable dinosaur  Trump Trump Card because of the name closely followed by Heels Over HeadAnd um Im pretty sure you forgot something... did you mean Mover Shaker Brute Breaker Master Tinker Blaster Thinker Striker Changer and Trump? Um still feels like theres something missing at the end but Im not sure what exactly.  Oh right All Unaware. Not sure how I forgot about All Unaware its like one of my favorite Ack stories ever but it had officially ended and last I heard theres no sequel planned either.EDIT More seriously I also forgot Breaker which is an even more obscure classification than Blaster.  I had to think quite a bit to even think of a character that would qualify and I cant recall many stories with either of them that dont have them as onedimensional villains somehow mislabelled as heroes anyway and the remaining ones tend to sideline the power in favor of character development.  I suppose its that one old crossover fic Alteran Alternative? something like that where Taylor is nanomachines then... not sure if it qualifies either but its pretty similar.,WormFanfic,dbjg4dl,7,t5_33pt9

11696012,0,t3_5f3deb,Deadbolt crossover starring Taylor as the reaper. In the game the Reaper almost has the same powers as Shadow Stalker with slight differences. Taylor will get a breaker power that can turn her into a black cloud though it needs a trigger to activate in this case a lighter. In this form she is invulnerable and can pass through the smallest of openings in the ground walls vents etc. Only thing is she cannot attack in this form. Also while in human form Taylor can be killed by that I mean that if a she is hit with something that could be lethal say a headshot from a gun her body will disintegrate and reform in an another location after some time.If SS uses crossbows Taylor goes for the more loud and lethal options. Several revolvers shotguns pistols and the like make up most of her arsenal though melee options are also there like knives hammers and a scythe cause you cant be a reaper without one.Main weaknesses that Taylor has is that she is only as durable as a normal human is. Aside from her breaker power it only gives her limited options in combat. With guns as her main offensive options running out of ammunition is also a thing. That is one of the main game play points of Deadbolt. Ammo conservation timing and accuracy of shots.For the story I plan it on being basically the premise of Deadbolt as it happens in Earth Bet while Worms story is happening at the same time. Aside from capes there was a long existing line of underground gangs that are supernatural in nature. Zombies Vampires Demons and Skeletons roam about in Bet though mostly unseen by villains rogues and the PRT alike. Dunno how to make it work but its a working draft so meh. Then there is a reaper that exists which sends demons to hell in body bags and the undead to heaven purgatory or hell depending on the case.To make it short Taylor becomes an efficient badass gun wielding grim reaper making sure dead people stay dead gets discovered by Shadow Stalker before she was a ward they hunt down dead people like partners in crime PRT and Villains get involved cause reasons and thats all I have for now.I cant really write but I could draw. Imo drawing Taylor in a suit with guns and a skeleton mask is easier than writing the thing. RIP my writing skills.Heres some game play footage of Deadbolt just to show how I plan Taylor to be in efficient in killing. ,WormFanfic,dglrf4q,2,t5_33pt9
