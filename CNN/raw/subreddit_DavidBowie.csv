I saw The Glass Spider tour there in BC Place in .  row  on the floor IIRC  I thought Duran Duran were really great and while I sorta liked the Georgia Satellites at the time I wasnt particularly moved by their performance.  David was great too  a bit out there in terms of the dance and theatrics involved with that show and as I was still a fledgling Bowiefan I didnt know all the songs but it was still a good time!

You Pretty ThingsLife On Mars?KooksQuicksandFill Your HeartBombersAndy WarholSong For Bob DylanQueen BitchThe Bewlay BrothersI think that Eight Line Poem could have been a Bside a curio for fans. It actually ruins the flow of the album for me.Bombers was originally intended to precede Andy Warhol so thats why Id place it there.My main reasoning for swapping Eight Line Poem with Bombers is that Bombers is the better song.

7237958,0,t1_d20otvz,Theres a live version of Moonage Daydream on the Hallo Spaceboy CD single from around the same time.MD is not as radically different as  the rearrangement of TMWSTW but it definitely sounds less glam and more industrial.I certainly think that the Live tag for TMWSTW on the Strangers When We Meet CD single is a fib. The track is a bit too precise to be a live performance. I suppose the actual title should have been paresthesised with ReRecording of Current Live Arrangement to be more factually accurate.  And as for Nirvanas version... Listening to Bowies own rearrangement of TMWSTW makes you realise that Nirvana were playing BOWIES version all along. They barely injected anything new into the song. It was karaoke.,DavidBowie,d20wj4h,1,t5_2smf8

7632073,0,t3_4jt9pb,I had preordered the clear vinyl sometime back off the website.  It arrived on Friday and I spent pretty much all weekend goofing around at home alternating between listens of Blackstar and everything else Bowie in my collection.  Luckily about a week before Blackstar arrived I managed to snag one of the rather expensive Station To Station deluxe vinyl box sets off ebay which is my favorite DB album and I am ohsoglad I did.  I got it for  and its gone up considerably since.  It arrived in the mail at the same time Blackstar did.  Words CANNOT express how happy I am to have made the decision to buy that box set when I did!  Needless to say I was in Bowie heaven all weekend.  I made a few posts on instagram mentioning Davids birthday and posting shots of my copy of Ziggy on MoFi and of course my Station to Station box.That Monday morning my wife woke me earlier than normal with the words David Bowie has died.  I thought I was dreaming and all I could utter was WHAT?  It was like we were on repeat.  I was gutted to say the least.  Still am.  Looking back I can recall the first viewing of the Blackstar video I had and thinking Man this is really out there even for David  but also thinking He has found yet another character!  Hes back!.  And when the break in the song comes and it gets a little more upbeat...a little more..soulful...I remember seeing David and thinking about how happy I was to see him but something wasnt right and I couldnt put my finger on it except to think that part of me felt like we wouldnt have him around much longer.  Something had definitely changed but you could still see David...the true gentleman and artist that he was..coming through.  He was and still is absolutely mind blowing.  There will never be another David Bowie.  ,DavidBowie,d39q4ei,3,t5_2smf8

11366950,0,t1_dfkdxed,I know its faaaar better than the original it just feels so out of place and I guess I just dont like the song itself. Only track I would remove from any of his albums ,DavidBowie,dfkf73k,2,t5_2smf8
11390774,0,t1_dfmls6f,Slip Away Uncle Floyd and Afraid were both songs from Toy that got redone for Heathen. Your Turn to Drive was finally released on the Nothing Has Changed comp. The other original song Hole In The Ground hasnt seen an official release yet so all we have is the  leak of Toy for it.,DavidBowie,dfn4kcr,3,t5_2smf8

11799947,0,t1_dgx4jzw,I watched a Bowie doc may have been the first Five Years but not sure where Fripp somewhat mocked the lyrics of the song specifically we are the goon squad and were coming to town beep beep. However he was pleased with himself in typical Fripp fashion ha over his uncovential choice of notes to start the track.As for DB I read a quote or two in Nicolas Peggs book to the extent of it is a lightweight track like fashion itself really. I believe it was also recorded conciously as a radio hit to pad out the album so its possible he viewed it as less artistic or original than other songs.,DavidBowie,dgxkcak,1,t5_2smf8
