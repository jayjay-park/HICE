11580332,0,t1_dg8mrgr,Really Ive been having a lot of fun with the x models. Im working on a build right now that will clip to my jacket like a button. Itll have a blutooth keyboardmouse soundboard and a monocle held in place by a magnet that I can snap to my glasses use and pull back off and snap back on my jacket. Sort of like a big ipod shuffle but thats also a full computer with a monocle attached. ,cyberDeck,dg8mya1,1,t5_3cfjd
