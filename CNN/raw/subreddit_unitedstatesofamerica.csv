2704034,0,t1_cnbfckd,The sun is below the horizon. I had to take a  second exposure because it was still so dark. You can tell because there are no harsh highlights and shadows the light is soft and even and has almost no contrast. I have others where the sun is up in the same location just  minutes later and it looks much different.,unitedstatesofamerica,cnbfsl0,2,t5_2sqbc

3438659,0,t1_cpjfx3q,Sure.  I was doing a composite of meteors so really just a single final shot to share.  I really would have liked to get the mountains in the frame but I needed adjust as the meteors were coming in just out of frame using my mm. Oh well...next year.  I parked right here for the night  Woke up at around AM with a good bit of snow coming in the cracked window and had to cover up a bit in my sleeping bag.I found that a blog worked better for my needs than px or flickr so here it is if you were interested. ,unitedstatesofamerica,cpk8e7e,2,t5_2sqbc

8185653,0,t1_d50qo26,We spent a few days in West Glacier. We had kids with us so werent doing any big hikes. On day  we checked out Lake McDonald and Trail of the Cedars. On day  we drove up to Polebridge and Bowman Lake. It was much quieter up that way! Plus Im kind of a nerd with my National Parks passport and I wanted to get a stamp up there. On day  we drove through the park up Logan Pass. That was the day of the grizzly attack though we never saw any emergency vehicles or anything. We didnt hear about it until the following day when family contacted us to make sure we were OK.Polebridge was a nice surprise. I went up that way for a stamp at the ranger station and stopped as we passed the Mercantile. Definitely one of the highlights of our tripthough there are many!,unitedstatesofamerica,d50r9wi,2,t5_2sqbc
