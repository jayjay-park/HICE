8514785,0,t3_4wcncz,Careerism is a huge issue that drives a ton of issues but it is not so much the result of Air Force policies but larger DOD policies and Statutory requirements such as the  GoldwaterNichols Act that restricted the force management of Officers careers across the DoD.To stop careerism you have to give people the option to stay operational and just do their jobs.
