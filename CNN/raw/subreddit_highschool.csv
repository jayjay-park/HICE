57417,0,t1_cegcyc7,The idealogy that you wont have any good options for college with one B is completely flawed. First off you have the rest of your time in high school to get As. Also colleges look much more closely on your th and th grade grades than freshman. Colleges wont only look into your grades. They will look at extra curriculars what you can contribute to the college and anything that can help you stand out. Then there is your reccomendations essays and ACTSAT scores. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT COLLEGES WILL LOOK AT THAT ONE B IS NOT GOING TO RUIN YOUR CHANCES AT A GOOD COLLEGE. ,highschool,cekyu15,1,t5_2r8t0

Even as a senior Im taking multivariable calculus dual enrolled with a university AP Physics C Mech  EampM AP Gov US amp Comp and AP statistics. Im taking other classes but those are the AP and postAP classes that Im taking.  Dont think of senior year as a year off use it as a year to prepare yourself for college.,highschool,cf4m71v,4,t5_2r8t0

Barrons is usually pretty good except in AP LangLit.If youre better at answering harder questions quickly go with the SAT. If youre better at answering easier questions with high accuracy go with the ACT. I scored  SAT  ACT and personally found the ACT easier.,highschool,cz36uno,1,t5_2r8t0

8830385,0,t1_d790sni,Omg thats a great idea!!! Ill definitely try to get that started.. we were thinking for club rush this week that wed sell clothespins for c each and people could write whatever they want on them and pin them onto people. And I just found out we cant request money from our school so we have to find another way to get supplies for our care packages ones full of mini hygiene supplies I was thinking of emailing several companies asking if they could donate or possibly sponsor us do you think thatd be a reasonable idea? ,highschool,d79aeoj,1,t5_2r8t0
8897773,0,t3_512twa,Most colleges that are really good want you to have something solid in every aspect or one thing thats super unique. Sophomore year is a good year to try out ALL the clubs and ALL the sports. After a month pick the top three or four clubs that youre interested in or have a strong relation to your strengthsintended major. Stick with them so you can get a leadership position in your junior and senior years. Start thinking about what you want in a college do you want to stay in state or go out? do you want to study abroad? do you want to do a specific major? You said you want to do track so look up which schools have the best track teams. KEEP YOUR GRADES UP! Small dips are okay if you can bring them back up but if youre aiming to be in the top  and your private school sends most grads to top schools you cant afford any mistakes. Niche Unigo Cappex College Confidential are the best resources you have online for the college process. The first three primarily show you your stats vs. stats from colleges but CC is full of forums of parents high school students college students and admissions counselors answering questions and explaining things. ,highschool,d7hdval,2,t5_2r8t0
9387823,0,t1_d8oplab,I agree with everything said above I just want to add that I think you sound really insecure and want people to console you. But thats not going to happen because deep down you know this is a horrible idea and the excuse youre searching for to back up your laziness isnt going to be found here. P.S. Dont act like a dick to your parents and peers because you have the misfortune of having to go through what millions of other people have to. Im just getting that kind of vibe from you.,highschool,d95z18l,1,t5_2r8t0
10491063,0,t3_5q17rr,Honestly I had the same adversity since th grade but that was because I moved schools. I did make new friends to hang out with but not actually true friends. So be really careful. I joined a program over the summer and this really helped me with my shyness and also boosted my leadership skills. But I also recommend joining a club and sports volunteering etc. ,highschool,dcx9tc8,2,t5_2r8t0
