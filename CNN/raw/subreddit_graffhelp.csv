It helps to get paint markers to be able to go over your previous work or you could just bomb ten spiral notebooks. But the key is doing thousands of yor name. Also dont treat it like an essay and keep in the lines fuckin stretch letters make some fat add swirls but please stay away from arrows  one maybe two at most and add them after you wrote your name to help with the flow of yor letters.

I dont care if you think you are the worst blackbook artist ever I want to hear your opinion. I dont want to call anyone out but useloc. If you are going to come comment on our stuff here give us some actual advice. A lot of us look up to you and respect your opinion. You have been in the game longer than anyone on here. The love and overall  is great on BBG but the guys that post here are here to work and get better. Edit samething for any of the other guys that post on BBG. I guess it should be understood that when you post here you are looking for CRITS.. I think a common misconception of people first starting out in graff is that its something that you can just whip out real quick. You say people need to develop their stuff before submitting but a lot of people really dont understand what the means to work on a sketch. Instead of just downvoting their post we just link them to the sidebar and tell them to hit the books.. Well thats kind of a problem Im probably the most hardcore person here and I dont feel a lot of people really get that. I mean I literally eat toys and krink for breakfest.

For walls I use mostly New Yorkers medium all rounder Pink Dots fat black dots slowskinny and whatever fastskinny cap I can find.   For trains I wouldnt use any skinnys. It was all New Yorkers for detail and pink dots or larger fatcaps gold caps ghost caps etc. Side noteNew Yorkers are a great all purpose cap but they require a trained touch to use well. You can outline with them use them as a fat cap tease them to do detailed stuff and produce a bunch of cool effects. The hooded type caps are easier to get the hang of for someone who hasnt developed really good finger control but it is worth putting in the effort for a New Yorker. ,graffhelp,cfnsujs,2,t5_2u4ca

This is normally frowned upon but my mentor lasted a total of  weeks before he got picked on the street so most of my knowledge comes from books and the streets of my city. TRACE THESE LETTERS FROM EVERY CORNER. DRAW THEM FROM EVERY ANGLE. THEN DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE WITH THE STRUCTURE. If you have no mentor go to the closet book store and raid their graff section. Rack the shit if you can Its a books store they are straight nerds and will never call you out or just buy it. This is a long ass post but ive been lurking this sub for awhile and their are some people here encouraging sloppy pieces.

Thats where graffiti is. Every wildstyle piece out there is based on a tag. So work on your handstyle. With that i mean go get a piece of paper and fill it with your name and first just normal letters so you get the flow going. Do that every time you have spare time. Do it all the time. If you are in school good. Fill the back pages of your notebook with your name and try to get a hang of it. If you do this all the time you will automatically improve and get style and flow among time.Later you can start working on simple block letter pieces on paper and then add a little more details and a little more and little more... With time i believe youll be good. Dont worry you just gotta work.,graffhelp,clnk0p7,1,t5_2u4ca

2699781,0,t3_2qxkwn,First off dont listen to fools whore telling you what should and shouldnt be practicing in your own goddam blackbook. Draw whatever you like kid. You dont need to learn handstylesthrowspieces in that order when youre learning to draw. Its all part of the same basic skillset and nearly every graffiti writer learns all the elements at the same time. Dont restrict yourself to only working on your handstyle cause some fool on the internet called youd look like a toy. My advice would be not to bother colouring your pieces at this stage. I understand why you want to but it turns a  minute pencil sketch into something that takes an hour but the only thing thats really teaching you about letterform is the pencil sketch. Does that make sense? A better way to approach it would be to only draw in pencil and do a few sketches in the time it takes to draw and colour just one. If you are going to colour your sketches and I understand the urge to when I first started I always wanted to colour my shit so it looked like graffiti the best thing to do is set yourself a rule of  do  sketches and only spend time colouring the best one. The truth is sketching is all about letterform. A dope sketch is a dope sketch in pencil or in sharpies every colour of the rainbow. If it looks weak before you colour it its still going to look weak afterwards so focus on that stage of the process while youre learning. But the most important thing is to not get bored. Honestly and I dont say this to be mean but there are a million things wrong with your sketch. Thats ok everyones like that in the begining. But theres not much point in getting crits at this stage because you need to work on every aspect of it. Keep working at it and youll get there thats the only crits you need at the moment.,graffhelp,cnaydsd,2,t5_2u4ca

Dont stop now!The reason the tags feel sloppy when you go too big is due to the thickness of your line. That pen can only go so thick so as your tag gets bigger it feels weaker and you can see more of the bumpssloppiness in the lines.Its also why your nd example here looks better than the others The lines are shorter and so feel thickerstronger. Try stepping up with a bigger pen and youll be able to increase the size of your tag.

6468294,0,t3_448fiq,The letters need to flow together and have similar styling. Trash the N and find something new. Theres basics and theres too basic. Next have confidence with your lines. You can see where you wavered and hesitated and you want a nice clean line. Other than the N your letter structure isnt terrible just make the lines in one fluid motion and look at some other handstyles to really find a flow you like. Keep at it. ,graffhelp,czod8ma,3,t5_2u4ca

6959528,0,t3_4b0y88,Well your bar consistency is pretty good. Baseline apparent. Youre adding something fun without being too crazy to start the coffin T  i dig that. All good things.Things I dont like   for some reason the G still looks like a C to me. Up to you but Id add that other small horizontal bar like in gt G just out of preference.   empty space on the top left of the G. That space is ok to start because all your letters slant forwards. When it gets to the ST those letters straighten up which makes it look like the front half is leaning onto the second half for no real reason. Id suggest either making the ST slant as well or straighten the GHO up so its all even in that respect   the zig zag bit on the bottom of the S. I mean I get it and the bars are Ok but i dont like it. I think thats because youve only used that bit on the S and it takes up almost half the letter which A makes the bit too prominent  like too much soy sauce on your sushi  and B covers critical parts of the Ss structure and makes it relatively harder to read than the rest.Keep it up  youre getting the fundamentals down and I think with practice youll be able to perfect it and expand to more complicated stuff in a few months no problem ,graffhelp,d15744y,6,t5_2u4ca

11011183,0,t3_5x7w80,Legibility id say. Youve got a cool style and nice clean lines. I like the textures and stuff but its still hard to read even when I know it says onepen. Things like the black hearts on N. The contrast between black and white is strong and because its not connected to the other bars yet the other letters are i find myself focusing only on the black bit and losing the N. Also O is very different which is cool but its a bit far from the other letters and idk i dont think it fits. It doesnt have D so theres no real weight to it either. Id love to see a whole piece like you did O though damn.Also i feel like the thin parts on E and P are a bit too thin and especially in the case of E and the aforementioned issue with N the top shapes begin to all look similar which contributes to it being hard to read ,graffhelp,deg3530,4,t5_2u4ca

11044584,0,t1_dejs3ou,I think youve got a really nice concept going with the shapes only thing that might be a problem is that the base shape is a little bit too specific. Like in the A   the hole in the A looks weird because its shoved to the left and the hole in the P is on the right side of the letter. This makes it look kinda unnatural to me so maybe you should try to change the A! This has some good potential though,graffhelp,dejvugk,2,t5_2u4ca
