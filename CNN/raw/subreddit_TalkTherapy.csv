At the time I had some borderline traits so fear of abandonment was a huge issue for me and knowing that this person would be there every week was part of what helped me form a genuine bond with someone that wasnt characterized by intense abandonment fears etc.,TalkTherapy,cv5thwo,2,t5_39dpu
5348884,0,t3_3o6zq8,I felt so embarrassed about the idea of getting therapy. I didnt want them to tell me I wasnt in enough trouble to really need it or to reject me because they couldnt help me. The whole thing just seemed too awkward and I decided to forget it.A year later I was sitting in my advisors office while told me to the psychiatric ER because I was actively suicidal and said I probably wouldnt make it until the next day.

I dont mean that to be mystical Im just too tired to type out all that could mean. Therapy is about to put it simply giving you a love for yourself that helps you stand on your own AND receive healthy love from those you choose. That you have this love is a good sign in that it means you have the capacity to love someone who is not fostering codependence. Youre struggling with feelings that are best dealt with in therapy so bringing them up there may really help. I hope it will. ,TalkTherapy,cz3belg,2,t5_39dpu

7724642,0,t3_4l38bl,Its very common to worry about your therapist dying especially if youve experienced significant losses through bereavement or estrangement. Youve lost other important figures and its scary to depend on your therapist. You wont scare or burden your therapist and Id be surprised if youre the first client whos broached this subject. I know Ive talked a lot with my therapist about my fears of him dying or not being there any more. A good therapist will be interested in how youre feeling and will explore that with you. They might look with you at how you experienced other losses in your life. None of this is silly. I hope you can bring this up with your therapist. As to boundaries you dont break boundaries by having thoughts or feelings or discussing them. This is your therapy and any thoughts feelings worries or fantasies should be allowable. ,TalkTherapy,d3k8kwn,5,t5_39dpu

8954215,0,t3_529h0u,Ive written journal entries before that addressed my fears about something and read those aloud because like you say sometimes its hard to say what you want to say. I never wrote a letter to the individual just read out what Id written for myself. It was very helpful.The only thing negative about it that Ive found is that if what you read is too long they might not hit on all the points youve brought up because they cant remember every single thing. So now I keep it short. Maybe  pages handwritten text maximum. Or I just skip over the irrelevant parts.,TalkTherapy,d7o5vio,2,t5_39dpu
9054109,0,t1_d804hhh,Therapy is a very specialized field one that can place client at great risk of harm. The purpose of education and licensure is to ensure a base level of competency of clinicians and to protect the public. The public at large doesnt tend to be educated in issues related to therapy nor do they necessarily be expected to be to seek therapy so it is important that the field take responsibility for gatekeeping in order to provide protection from harm.     Therapists need education in theory techniques ethics legal issues duty to warn confidentiality and when to break it etc. modalities diagnosis even if you dont agree with it the process is important and case conceptualization human physical and psychological development the process of researching new subjects and being discriminating towards new techniques multicultural concerns and how they effect therapy and evidence based practices.     After all of that education then supervision is the next step. Because of the emotional toll that therapy can take on the therapist this is to monitor therapist functioning and self care to ensure no harm comes to clients.     At this point you may be eligible for a degree in therapy in your field of choice. Then the process of licensure involves further supervised practice in order to ensure growth and client safety. All of this process ensures therapistclient confidentiality in the event of a court order to subpoena your records. Without being an educated and licensed therapist there is no legal protection for confidentiality for clients which means anything you write down about them can be shared with whoever you want.     Hopefully thats a thorough explanation for why you cant just decide to be a therapist one day and hang out a shingle. Its a massive undertaking in order to ensure clients are helped and well served not harmed and protected from having their private business shared.      Edit I just want to point out that asking why not just anyone can decide to be a therapist one day is very similar to asking why doctor need special degrees and to pass their boards similar to licensure as do the people who prepare your taxes for a few you have to have a CPA license in most places. Why should therapists be held to a lesser standard than the person who does your taxes?Edit  Also based on your posts Im beginning to think that this account is an account owned by the same person who uses the philotherapist account. I could be wrong but between the rejection of mainstream education and basis in Australianot to mention you post very similarlyI think its like.,TalkTherapy,d805qy2,6,t5_39dpu

9855229,0,t1_darpm4o,I had a psychiatrist who I dont think liked me very much. She sort of terminated with me because I wasnt interested in her med recommendation and I told her I wasnt certain that her diagnosis was correct. She knew I was terminating anyway because my insurance was changing  weeks later to an insurance she didnt accept. Still it seemed pretty clear that she had had enough of me.  Anyway... I ran into her once in a parking lot. I had payed into the central meter and was walking back to my car to check that it was locked damn OCD and I realized that she was walking right towards me. As soon as I saw her I looked down and when I looked up again I realized that she had turned around and walked in the opposite direction. Figured that she was going to walk past me and ignore me as I was about to do to her but I get she felt more comfortable walking away.

I understand the limitations though but I dont think I could have started to make peace with it on my own! Talking about it in therapy is honestly the only thing that has made the feelings manageable. I feel similarly to what another person posted  I am starting to view this as a good quality about myself. I love this person very much and I have the capacity to do that.

10537576,0,t3_5qvpdq,Its true that there is a lot of group therapy in that type of setting. Hopefully youd get enough individual therapy as well. In groups no one is forced to participate and a great number of people dont. Its more interesting and engaging when people participate but sometimes you just dont have anything to add or say. Usually groups have themes so you dont have to make up things to say out of thin air. Honestly the groups can be a good way to pass the time and maybe learn something otherwise youd just be sitting around doing nothing. ,TalkTherapy,dd2ju9k,4,t5_39dpu

11674698,0,t1_dgikacw,wow.  no one suggests that therapists ought to accomodate overtime  but at the same time this is an example of when the therapists needs come first.  saying otherwise is to put forth a farce or charade.  and the therapist does need to be mindful of how to manage affect within a window of tolerance as well as help clients develop attachment relationships outside.  a therapist should acknowledge that the situationstructure inherently invites people to form attachments  which are NOT naturally limitedmanaged  and then manage them in a business model because well capitalism.  this is UNNATURAL and difficult and it takes a lot of willpower and work.  a therapist should acknowledge this!  ALSO it feels completely awful if a therapist not only doesnt acknowledge it but then  by lecturing on boundaries  demonstrates that it is a ONESIDED attachment completely.  basically humans are built to form attachments.  not onesided relationships that come in minute increments.  to ask someone to accept that is fine but to expect human brains to be able to manage it without strong emotional reactions is neurological nonsense.,TalkTherapy,dgjcd97,3,t5_39dpu
