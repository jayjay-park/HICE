179966,0,t3_1w5sfa,Amrut Intermediate Sherry. . ABV. Thanks to Uncle T for the sample. Nose Very woody and spicy. Pungent cooking spices that I cant quite finger. Nutmeg maybe anise? Intricate and fascinating. Taste Rich and malty. Quite sweet given the relatively dry nose. The sherry influence is extremely fruity and candied. Cherry cough drops and canned fruit cocktail. Tobacco and vanilla bean are there but in the back seat. Finish The spices are back. Cloves spiced orange nutmeg. Flavor holds up in the back of my mouth for a good long while.Absolutely incredible nose but a little too fruity and candied for me couldnt quite get past it. Amrut is good stuff but this wasnt quite as enjoyable for me as the standard CS. ,worldwhisky,ceyxmjz,3,t5_2vadq

614085,0,t3_216irz,Interestingly the Irish Whiskey brand Tullamore Dew is owned by the very Scottish Grant family. Im of course referring to the Glenfiddich Grants and not the Glenfarclas Grants or the Glen Grant Grants etc... Anyway St. Patricks day was just a bit ago so Scottish ownership aside lets review this affordable and available Irish blend!Tullamore DewColor Amber ABV Aroma NeatMulled Apple Wine Cinnamon Flinty amp Mineral Malt Barley Grist Light Corn Syrup Spun Sugar German Rock Sugar Breakfast Tea lets say Irish... Plum slightly Vanilla Bean Mashed Bananas.A complex and balanced nose. The fruityyetmineral malt and sweet grain components are in good balance. It seems good casks exbourbon and exsherry where used.Aroma WaterMaple Syrup delicious! Barley Sugar Tupelo Honey Lemon Grass Golden Hay Vanilla Bean Banana Bread Raisins Nutmeg Cinnamon slightly Honeydew Melon and other assorted tropical fruits. The sweetness takes on a lot of complexity with a dash of water. There is a subtle but important spice undertone that gives the nose a greater sense of quality. Finally an excellent tropical fruit character arises after a few minutes in the glass. Taste NeatCream of malt Barley Waxy Honey FlintStony Minerality Wood Glue Burnt Match Sticks slightly Dried Fruits raisins Lemon Grass slightly.Shows good dimensionality malt fruit oak. A surprising hint of sulfur thats the match sticks but it works in the way a good Mortlach does a meaty fuller flavor is the result.Taste WaterGolden Syrup Dried fruits slight sulfur Flinty Malt Grist Baking Soda Green Oak tannic Barley Water Copper Chocolate slightly Bananas Nutmeg Cinnamon.The pot still character shows through more with water jammy dried fruits and a coppery tang.FinishCooked Barley Burnt Vanilla Marshmallows Barrel Char Drying Oak Glue Cola Nut Tin. Mostly American oak characteristics manifest in the finish which is surprisingly dry and tannic. The wood glue becomes a bit of an off note. ConclusionHighly enjoyable nose particularly with water.Tasty palate with good complexity. The different whisky makes grain malted unmalted and cask types all have something to contribute.Dry and grainy finish with lots of vanilla. Maybe too dry for some. A gluey note doesnt help things.Rating Tullamore Dew is above average for a  USD bottle of whisky. A few flaws are present but this is still a reasonably articulate dram. Certainly something to try if youd like a change of pace from Jameson which is also quite good. Speaking very generally I think in the  USD price range Irish blends tend to be better value for money than Scottish ones... Take that as you will!Joshblog,worldwhisky,cga2n1c,5,t5_2vadq

2306769,0,t3_2lp64r,Greetings WorldWhisky! Im working through my oldest samples and this is one of them. This is Karuizawa Spirit of Asama an NAS single malt from the dead distillery Karuizawa which is apparently a vatting of casks from  and  so this is roughly  years old. This sample is from uUncleTobys. Is it any good?Lets find out!Karuizawa Spirit of Asama  Japan  ABV NAS NCF NCA ml sample from uUncleTobys Nose Dry wineyness. Vermouth. White sherry. Ginger. Stewed tea. Wet tobacco. Plum wine. White pepper. Rather harsh.So very very Japanese in that dry winey way. Interesting but quite young and harsh.Taste Extremely dry. No burn. Vermouth. Dry oak. Ginger. Tobacco. Green tea. Slightly bitter. Plum wine. Brine.Again odd and dry like the nose  dominated by wine tannins and that odd oakiness. Finish Lengthy. Dry oak. Plum wine. Tannins. Slight smoke. White pepper. Pickled something capers?Long and dry continuing the notes of the palate. Summary Theres something about Japanese whisky they almost all have this type of dry wine and oak spiciness on the nose. Someone give it a name please because Im always lost for a descriptor. Is it the Mizunara oak? How common is that actually in Japanese whisky maturation? This doesnt taste like  which is a bonus but its too dry for me. It is very very Japanese though so if you like that kind of thing you might like this a bit more than I do. I dont think Id have bought a bottle when it was released.Score   Weird Japanese.Most Similar To Nikka Yoichi  White Oak Akashi .Buy Again? No.,worldwhisky,clwu09b,5,t5_2vadq

2560530,0,t3_2p2u9z,Special thanks again to everyones favourite Uncle for the sample of this one.So as I said before this whisky was and still is on my Bucket list. I wanted to try it so much and now I have so now I set a new goal which is to keep trying a bunch of different whiskys before I die. Or after because maybe Ill come back as Zombie Whisky Jesus.Heartwood Convict Redemption Batch  just sounds so Australian. Or rather stereotypical Aussie. Youve got the word Convict right in the middle. And Redeeming itself like a former penal colony. I mean only if it was called Heartwood Convict Venomous Walkabout ThatsNotAKnifeThisIsAKnife Irwin Koala Redemption then it would encompass all of the stereotypes.Granted than wed have to make a whisky called Maple Sorry Ice Hockey Poutine Healthcare and thatd be silly.Anyway this is a  year Australian Port Cask whisky from Heartwood bottled at a cask strength usually reserved for NASA space rocket fuel. And if that doesnt interest you then Im very sad for you. Lets see how this tastes!Price No longer availableRegion Australia Abv .Note This is the highest Abv. in a whisky Ive ever had. As such after trying it by itself I did add some water eventually up to  tsp. I didnt really note the difference in my notes however I do believe this needs water. For me at least it does.Colour Deep burgundyNose Apricot pine sour apple cherry sea salt strawberry ginger cranberry scented candlesReally big blast of apricot at first. Hard to get around without letting it sit or adding water. After awhile it had this fake cranberry note.Big flavours though. You can really tell each one. That said it does take some time to get used to it and let each one come out.Taste Orange cake strawberry butterscotch nutmeg custard nutty BlondiesHave I had Orange Cake before? Not really but it tastes like an Orange flavoured cake so there you have it.Not overly sweet. Heartwood so far seems to know how to balance out the different sweetness levels throughout their drams. Really quite nice. Couldnt identify the nut flavour though. Guess it must be a Thursday night.Moving along...Finish Cinnamon dark fruits woody ginger ale light dill pepper burncayenne blueberryBig ole finish that reminds me a lot of a Bourbon. Strong too. First sign of burn after I added some drops of water yet that turned to cayenne flakes once I added some more.Again you can really pick out these large flavours given some time with the dram.Conclusion This is a well made dram. Its strong dont get me wrong and it needs the water just to mellow it out a little yet each flavour is distinct and tasty. Nothing way complex like the Vat out of Hell.Actually Im pining for the last one more than this one. Again this is a great dram with really great powerful flavours that you only need to search for a little bit. Yet I feel that its missing some complexity. Maybe I just dont like Aussie Port? That could be the case. Maybe it needed more time in the barrel? Maybe it needed some time in a dried wine barrel? I cant really say. Maybe Im full of shit? Could be.If youre looking for a good fruity dram that gets the whole sweet balance correct this is a good one. If youre looking for something amazing go for Vat out of Hell.World Whisky review  Australian review  Whisky Network review Other Heartwood reviews Heartwood Vat out of Hell,worldwhisky,cmssqwd,5,t5_2vadq

Though the cask strength Crown Royal is an odd whisky at cask strength since it lacks some of the qualities you would expect of a cask strength whisky.

5518991,0,t3_3qp7ze,Another Fine Day for a Fine Drams review. Buy now!Another sucking up to the Fine Drams guys? Okay Ill get on with it.So I recently did a lot of Japanese reviews. A bombing of reviews... if I was insensitive. Maybe a gaggle? No thats not Japanese... A harajuku of reviews? Perhaps a octopus of reviews? Many tentacles?Have I alienated everyone yet? Okay.I like Japan. I find it interesting though not in that its better than us anime watching umami swilling way. More so I enjoy other cultures and how they do different things. I enjoy Sweden and India too but todays about Japan so fuck those places. Gently.With care.Anyway Im mostly babbling because I didnt find too much about White Oak Akashi Single Malt. This NAS is produced by White Oak from the Akashi range. And thats all I could find. Oh! And its a single malt! So Ive covered EVERYTHING written in the name!Wait! I found a sketchy website!Its made in a mild climate... okay not helping. The malt is from England.. And its made with water. Oh! Jackpot! They use Spanish Oak Sherry American Oak sherry and bourbon barrels.Thats pretty impressive. Or wrong. The website was sketchy.Alright dont want to overload you guys with much more. I mean no one really wants to hear more about whats going in our mouths.Lets see how it tastes.Price NA at the LCBORegion JapanAbv Colour YR Nose Plum sour wheat butter sour cream ginger pepper honey smokeVery sour. Super sour. Buttery and sour. Lots of different notes but sour is the main. Lots of sherry influence... or sour milk. Maybe more so sour milk.Not bad. Kinda harsh in its own special way like a little person with tourettes and a penchant for beating his wives. You dont like him. Nor respect him. However hes good at playing Rummy so you keep him around... Just not around anyone you like.Taste Butter corn cereal sweet milk grilled lemon raw alcoholMore butter... check.. My diets going fine thank you.I like the grilled lemon. Nice burnt parts to it.And then theres this raw alcohol part that isnt so nice. Needs more time in the casks.Finish Burnt cake candy basil floral wheatMore burning. And much like other things that arent bonfires or effigies thats not a good thing. The rest would be passable without that.Conclusion So I think they have a good start here and need to wait for more. The good Japanese whiskies are ones that are taken out at the right time. Or mixed in highballs barring that.This... not so much for me. It started out okay and seems to be a case of pushing something out the door a little too quick. Oh well. I hear the Blend is controversial and fun to drink so maybe Ill try that next... in a few months.World Whisky review  Japan review  Whisky Network review All reviews on my Wordpress,worldwhisky,cwh3nih,1,t5_2vadq

6589425,0,t3_45xwdk,For those from the Toronto area the name Gooderham amp Worts name should sound familiar  it is still prominently displayed in the citys trendy distillery district.  The distillery itself once the larger distiller of alcoholic spirits in Canada has long since closed.  As a standalone whisky Gooderham amp Worts was originally released by Corby as part of their shortlived Canadian Whisky Guild series of the late s. Since that time two of the other members of this series  Lot  and Pike Creek  have both returned as modern staples of Corbys whisky lineup.  I dont know if the resurrected GampW will similarly catch on and persist  so if you are curious to try it you may not want to wait too long just in case.This new Gooderham amp Worts is a four grain whisky blend of corn rye wheat and barley.  Initial reviews have tended to be mildly positive  generally scoring slightly higher than typical for a Canadian whisky although not reaching Lot s starry heights. GampW is now bottled at . ABV and currently sells for . at the LCBO.Colour Light golden amberNose  Very sweet up front somewhat floral and surprisingly fruity.  Notes of pear cherries oranges peaches and apricots. Bubblegum too. Theres a sweet creamy texture to the aromas like condensed milk or creamed wheat which is quite distinctive. Unfortunately there is a noticeable solvent smell initially with acetone particularly prominent. Fortunately this fades once you let it sit in the glass for awhile  so I recommend you pour yourself a dram and leave it alone for at least  mins before sampling.Palate  The sweet floral and fruity notes show up first and that bubblegum again then waves of the classic rye baking spices of cinnamon cloves and nutmeg. These notes really dominate and persist for a good while drowning out almost everything else in the blend. A bit of the wheat persists throughout but its subtle below the rye and the corn is nowhere to be found. Odd that I wasnt really getting all that much rye on the nose. You get some of the classic vanilla and caramel flavours as well  along with a slightly woody character overall.Finish  Medium long with cinnamon hearts and cloves all the way to the end  a very nice spicy finish. Somewhat drying on the tongue there is a bit of the wheat sweetness persisting for a good while as well. This makes a nice change from the bitter finishes of some of the cheaper Canadian blends with their upfront corn sweetness.General Impressions   As you can tell from the above I liked this blend. The unfortunate initial solvent note that mercifully dissipates over time is likely a sign of the young age of some of the grain whisky in the blend. I would also have expected a bit more of the wheat and barley to shine through  although this does make a very decent classic Canadian rye blend as is. At this price point however I would recommend Corbys Lot  or Wisers Legacy for newcomers to Canadian whisky.Score     Lifetime scoring stats  Mean score  . Standard Deviation .

Palate While this smells like it could give you diabetes it isnt overpoweringly sweet. Juicy fruit gum Krispy Creme glazed donuts and more rummy goodness. I dont really like rum but I like rummy things. Like this whisky. Finish Its got some pep to it bringing in some cinnamon and a little bit of bitter tannins. Clove spice is the last note. Summary Mmmmmmmmmmmm this is fantastic stuff and has no problem delivering a boatload of flavor at ABV. This has all the beautiful malty qualities that I admire in Amrut.Score  Lark Port CaskStrength .Color Dark amber. Nose Juicy dark fruits. Strawberry jam and cherry filling. The frosted pastry notes come through in this Lark whisky as well. I really dig the malt profile here and the port accents it just as well as the rum did. Palate Waves of fruit and chocolate with spices artfully mixed in. Plums chocolate cinnamon dark cherries chocolate again and a little cayenne pepper. The spicy kick is energizing! Finish Tongue numbing and awesome. Porty notes linger while ghost pepper chocolate smolders on. I wont forget Ive been drinking this anytime soon. Fortunately I didnt review these in the order theyre listed here otherwise Im not sure Id be able to taste the Sullivans Cove.Summary A monstrously powerful dram from Lark this is just like a ported Heartwood. Its brutal but I love it. It too is an Australian Portonova. Score  Sullivans Cove French OakStrength .Color Golden amber. Nose This has a cleaner more polished nose. Strawberry crisp red grapes and pineapple come through clearly. The malt isnt nearly as sticky sweet but has more of a pound cake quality to it. Palate Wine and tawny port with a prodominent nutty character to it. The fruits are still there as well but darker and drier. Raisins prunes and purple plums are present among dark bitter cocoa and oak. Finish The woody notes take over with chocolate and tobacco. Oak swells up and drowns out everything else as it wisps away. Summary This is quite assertively oaky while the port comes through nicely as well. If you like an oak bomb this will be right up your alley. Its a bit too much for me but a quality pour nonetheless. Score  Final Thoughts Theres a lot of high quality stuff coming out of Australia. Im tempted to say that the common denominator is Lark since many Heartwood products contain sourced Lark. Ill have to cross reference my Heartwood scores against the source and percentages to see if that theory holds up. In any case I hope Australia starts sending more whisky to the rest of the world. I know Id like to have some on my shelf. World Whisky Reviews   amp Whisky Reviews   amp ,worldwhisky,d0sr2ay,7,t5_2vadq

9364033,0,t3_58sx3s,So Ive been away for a bit and its time to get back on track.I was very lucky to be able to visit the James Sedgwick distillery a short while ago. The distillery is most known for its Three Ships Whisky a South African whisky that has been making quite a name for itself recently in the world whisky scene. They also distill Bains Cape Mountain Whisky a corn whisky.The distillery is located in the town of Wellington in the Western Cape in South Africas famed winelands. The grounds themselves are very beautiful with a very well kept garden and a pond with ducks and geese who are apparently well fed off of all the grains. We were warmly welcomed by Simon who was our guide for the visit. We arrived a bit early and Simon showed us around the new visitor center which is very impressive well decorated and full of really nice informational displays about the distillery and whiskymaking. Simon also showed us the room where the  year old opening sale was done. Ill have a post all about this  year old but in short its a follow up to the very tasty  year old finished in PX casks released last year. At  years its the oldest Three Ships ever released and was finished in casks which previously held Pinotage a South African red wine developed in South Africa from Pinot Noir and Cinsaut so quite a unique South African whisky.Back to the tour we were given a cocktail forgot which one while we waited for everyone to arrive. The tour and visitor center are relatively new and were previously by invite only and the groups are still kept quite small around  people and need to be booked in advance.Once everyone arrived we were taken to the still room. Simon gave as the talk about whiskymaking outside as the distillery was in operation at the time. Particularly interesting was the fact that the distillery was revamped in  including bringing in two copper pot stills from Scotland. I think that this really reflects the seriousness and willingness of parent company Distell to let their South African whisky brands compete on the World Whisky scene. This is fantastic news as the skills and ability are very clearly there and have been for a long time. Ive mentioned this in some previous posts about Three Ships but when I grew up in South Africa the brand was very much a cheap local alternative to imported Scotch Whisky and was pretty much petrol. As far as I understood the distillery manager Andy Watts had long wanted to make it something more than that and it slowly began to happen. Aside from the pot stills we also saw the very impressive column still used to make Bains. Bains was introduced in  after some experimentation with a Bourbon Cask finished Three Ships finished with firstfill bourbon casks which was supposed to test the market to see if a sweeter whisky was viable. It worked well enough that the Bourbon Cask Three ships was permanently added to the range and Bains was released as well. The column still is very nicely hidden within a tall structure made to look like the pagoda style chimney found in the classic Scottish distilleries. Like most modern distilleries Three Ships dont actually do their own maltings and bring in their malt from external malting houses the malted barley coming from Scotland so its just a nice decorative touch.We then moved to the maturation warehouses. No photography was allowed here due to safety and all that but believe me the size of the warehouses was very impressive. They use rack storage and store casks in lots of several pallets. They exclusively use exbourbon casks for both Bains and Three Ships and mix firstfill and refill casks to achieve a range of flavours. Simon did allude to Andy Watts special maturation warehouse where he experiments with all sorts of other cask types and which has given birth to things like the PX and Pinotage finished releases. I was very impressed with the amount of information Simon had off the top of his head about the maturation processes done here particularly the unique aspects of the climate in the Western Cape.After the maturation warehouse we went back to the visitor centre for the interactive part of the tour. Laid out in front of us was a tray with three whiskies Bains Three Ships Bourbon Cask Finish and Three Ships yearold. In addition to the whiskies were smoked and unsmoked applechips smoked snoek pate snoek is a very tasty South African fish especially good smoked pulled beef in a sweet BBQ sauce a blue cheese and herb dip dark chocolate mousse and a little pumpkin pie. We first tried the whiskies on their own so here are the tasting notes for the Bains and the Bourbon Cask Finish Ive already reviewed the yearoldBains Cape Mountain WhiskyNAS age varies usually around  years ABV. Nose Vanilla custard. Banana flavouring. Herbal honey. Slight alcohol note.  Palate Very vanillacentric woody note. Banana bread. Dried apricot. Woodspice.  Finish Medium. Woodspice banana. Toffee. Slight saltiness.Would I buy this YesWould I order this in a bar YesWould I drink this if someone gave me a glass YesVFM This is a fantastic Corn Whisky. Its very sweet obviously but has a lovely light character so not overthetop sweetness. Theres a nice amount of wood influence too. It could easily hold its own with some of the best American corn whiskies and at the local price its worth getting a whole bottle just to try some.Three Ships Bourbon Cask FinishNAS. ABV. Finished in firstfill bourbon casks. Nose Salty toffee. Grit. Slightly earthy. Wood tannins. Faint tropical fruit notes. Palate Quite aggressive. Bitter wood. Woody vanilla. Some more tropical fruit but the alcohol overpowers the nicer notes.  Finish Short. Bitter wood and bitter fruit.Would I buy this NoWould I order this in a bar NoWould I drink this if someone gave me a glass NoVFM  its dirt cheapThis one really didnt work for me. It felt unbalanced with an overpowering presence of ethanol drowning out the more subtle notes. Essentially just rough whisky. Of the three whiskies tasted my favourite was the  year old. Its quite peaty I have a bottle at home and its been growing on me more and more but the Bains was also very impressive. We then proceeded to pair the whiskies with the food. Simon was very insistent that this be done without guidance from him so we could freely explore the various combinations. As a peathead I obviously experimented most with the yearold which went especially well with the blue cheese dip. During the tasting and pairing we had some really nice discussions within the group about whisky and South African whisky and some other types of alcohol too. In all it was a really amazing visit the disitllery looked amazing and the small groups really adds a personal touch. The only problem I had was that there wasnt anything special on offer to taste such as a distillery exclusive whisky or maybe being able to try a malt and corn whisky straight from the cask. I mentioned this to Simon who agreed and apparently something is already in the pipes. Even without something unique to try the visit was fantastic and well worth doing. I heavily recommend it to anyone visiting the area its also a nice break from the wine.Reviewed in my blog ,worldwhisky,d92yi24,1,t5_2vadq
9729558,0,t1_d95u0ot,Nice review. I do like this whisky but... My issue with it is that with world whiskies I like to see them create a local style. While this is a very drinkable liquid it is VERY much a Scotch style. I love what Amrut and some of the Japanese distilleries have achieved but for the time being this feels like a world whisky posing as a scotch.,worldwhisky,dacdpt5,2,t5_2vadq

10427629,0,t3_5pcagj,My Nikka WFTB died today. . Thank god I have a fresh one!! And heres whyName  Nikka Whisky From The BarrelStrength  . ProofColor  Amber.Nose  Caramel malt I get some pepper but also flowers and fruit. A bit of oak comes through too. Same with vanilla.Palate  Malt fruit especially orange cinnamon and clove. The oak balances really well with the fruits. I also get some vanilla and caramel as it lingers on my tongue.Finish  Lots of caramel and a smooth sweet finish dominate. Very satisfying.Theres not much I can say here other than that this whisky is a really amazing find. It brings back really great memories of Fukuoka and Bar Kitchen so I am rating this especially high for sentimentality. If you ever get a chance to visit Japan I highly recommend picking one up over there...its  and this is easily as good as whiskies twice to three times its price. I would cry because mine died today but I have a new one waiting for me! DScore  Review WorldWhisky Review ,worldwhisky,dcq1gpt,3,t5_2vadq

11014184,0,t3_5xa3wi,Teeling Single Malt NCF bottled Sep ampnbspTeeling Single Malt is made from  malted barley from a range of different ages including malt whiskey distilled in . Consists of a vatting of  different wine cask Sherry Port Madeira White Burgundy Cabernet Sauvignon finished Irish malt whiskeys. Thanks to uThrozen for this sample!ampnbspNose Green apple pear green grapes honey lemongrass caramelTaste Honey banana custard green apples malt vanilla white pepperFinish Green apples banana oak mineral noteampnbspFruity if a little delicate on the nose. Not a lot of depth but quite aromatic. In tasting the flavours appear younger now but still pleasant. Big hits of honey and green apples up front turning into this interesting cross between a Twinkie and a banana cream pie in the middle with a hint of spice. Good up until this point but it loses me in the finish. Nice crisp apple to start but then the banana hits followed by an oaky bitterness and a fizzy mineral note to end things off. Overall a pretty pleasant dram if a little bland. With all the casks in the mix I was hoping for some crazy flavour combinations but this wasnt complex at all. Im not quite sure what this motley crew of cask finishes did but honestly they all seemed pretty slack other than the white burgundy one. Also got the sense that it could benefit from a bit more time to let the youthful notes develop further especially to improve on the finish. ampnbsp,worldwhisky,degfdgb,3,t5_2vadq
