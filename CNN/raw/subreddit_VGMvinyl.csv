11358088,0,t3_61usul,The Engineer Edition is explained on the bandcamp page for the releasegtTHIS COMPILATION CONTAINS all the pieces from the original Risk of Rain OST... with a twist! Instead of full mixes you get separate audio stems for all main groups of instruments. Those includegtgtDrumsgtBassesgtSynthsgtKeysgtPadsgtGuitarsgtLeadsgtMisc.gtgtThe grouping depends on the track. For example in some synthheavy tracks there are two synth stems. I have also included separate stems of all vocoders and the woodwinds in CdA. All solos are exported in isolation so you can easily replaceremove them at will.,VGMvinyl,dfjf2na,3,t5_3blhp
