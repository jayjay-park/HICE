2806009,0,t3_2s6ulj,My recommendation is to directly buy from the online shops of the various makers instead of these random and more than likely counterfeit pusher shops. Yes you might end up paying more but like MCRiide said well specifically  dont buy a piece of shit  and as well if its going to be something that will be on your face  treat yourself with something awesome and dont settle for less nor put garbage on your face either.  Now my questions for you are this. You want new or vintage? What style of frame are you looking for?  aviator circular square etc What is your facial structure like? Male or Female? From that I can make recommendations. c,sunglasses,cnn18kr,2,t5_2rc6z

3295301,0,t3_2xsq25,I really like pretavoir. They seem to have consistently low prices. I purchased a pair of IC! Berlin sunglasses for  off of msrp. They currently have the aviator I think you are looking for for  They are a certified dealer so you know they are legit.

4788879,0,t3_3gcrus,Why you want a pair of glasses to fall is beyond me. but whatever Plastic frames get out of adjustment easily wearing them on top of your head will splay the temples quickly and youll have the loose fitting sunglasses you desire in no time unfortunately they will start sliding down your nose about that time too sounds like you have too small of a frame and you got too short of temples to boot. The person helping you should have pointed that out and directed you to the larger size.,sunglasses,cty6dyc,1,t5_2rc6z

5342516,0,t1_cvlbfg5,well to be honest theres nothing special about them... but Im a HUGE Jurassic Park fan very poor childhood  VHS tapes one was JP.But also now that Im older I like sunglasses I Just thought it would be very cool to have the very same shades he wore in the movie... As a shades collector I found his shades particularly interesting to me taste such as the unique nosebridge piece.Also but collector I just mean I own only  pairs of really nice shades... so now starting out.Also Im of Indian decent East not western.I just want them because Im a huge JP geek and it would we really be precious to me to own the exact model of shades he wore in the movie. Now that I can actually afford to buy nice things.,sunglasses,cvukd2z,1,t5_2rc6z

9246021,0,t3_56z4q4,At the end of the day its going to come down to lens material and to a lesser extent brand.  Good quality hard polycarbonate will be more scratch resistant than cheapo  dollar lenses but they will still scratch if you treat them badly.Glass lenses are much much more scratch resistant but may shatter when you drop them.  Some types of frames are more prone to this than others.  As brands go a lot of the mainstream fashion brands use the same lenses youll find in your  dollar cheapies coach armani and ralph lauren are the worst offenders here IMO although the ralph lauren lenses provide polarized at a pretty low price.  If you want really nice lenses you either go with something in a glass lens or a high end maui jimstyle polycarbonatehybrid lens.The glasses will last as long as you take care of them.  You dont go throwing them in your pocket or backpack without a case leaving them around on tables etc.  You can even keep  dollar cheapies in good condition without much work.   If you cant really take care of those...expensive glasses will probably not be any better.,sunglasses,d8o017h,1,t5_2rc6z
