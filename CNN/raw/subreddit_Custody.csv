4373172,0,t3_3b3nm1,What you propose doesnt work. Kids need stability AND consistency. So that means one of you will have to have her the majority of the time except holidays. This brings up a legal AND moral dilema. Who should have physical custody? Should it be the parent moving or staying behind? This is usually answered by best interest of the child AND significant change in circumstances. Wanting to move is neither unless you get a substantial improved job that depending on your State may do the trick.The question is would you be able to live not seeing your child frequently? If not then what youre doing is not morally right for your ex and the child.,Custody,csilbgr,4,t5_2rz0i
4579252,0,t3_3cwynk,Passing him on and giving up wont fix anything. He sounds like someone who has given up on succeeding and being sent from ward to ward doesnt help. There will come a time when he will need you more than ever. Make sure you are there and his life may turn around. The first thing Id advise is to let the probation officer know. Do not be an accessory. You can only do so much and it must be physically and emotionally exhausting. However he reminds me of myself when I was in my mid teens. I had no self esteem and didnt think it mattered what I did. I had lost the feeling that I had the potential to succeed in life. He may feel that same way isolating him from bad influences will do nothing because he is seeking those out. I feel the only way you can help him is to bring his self worth back. Have him reach for a goal. ,Custody,ct7tipf,1,t5_2rz0i

5075378,0,t3_3kg2bj,gthe has stated that he told the kids they might miss games because mommy wont be able to go to them and that the kids said it is ok. We feel this has put them directly in the middle of a decision that should have been between adults.Was he wrong? Yall decided not to let the kids participate in half of the games so he informed them of your decision. gtGreat! Now they can resent us for not taking them to practicegames. Did you expect him to lie for you? If they want to play and you dont let them they may be upset with you. Thats life. If youre sure that you made the right decision stand by it and deal with the kids hurt feelings. If youre not sure talk to the kids and consider changing your decision. ,Custody,cuxrw8u,2,t5_2rz0i

6428201,0,t1_czk5eso,What is he now asking for? To have custody basically as agreed upon unless mom doesnt agree in which case you get nothing is kind of unreasonable and I can understand if hed want something more serious on paper.However if hes only seeing them once per year hes going to have a hard time getting a judge to agree that he should go from seeing them once per year to  or something like that.,Custody,czk7pj7,1,t5_2rz0i

7613315,0,t3_4jhisi,A typical experience that mothers also face is when the noncustodial parent is blocked access. btw.. its not visitation. Its parenting time. You dont visit your children. You parent them. The response is to document and file for contempt. My stepson resides with his father my SO  of the time. My former stepdaughter still very close with our family resides with her father my ex  of the time with mother having extremely limited visitation. My best friends stepson resides with them as of  weeks ago  of the time.,Custody,d37lejm,3,t5_2rz0i
7638201,0,t1_d37jloj,Thank you for the carefully thought out message. We have agreed on a day to speak next week about all of this. I am still comfy with the child support change fair is fair. I believe I am ready to hold my ground on the biannual revisiting of the custody arrangement. I agree with you and others that there are already controls in place in the system that allow for visitation of the agreement if she deems it necessary and I have zero intention of opening up loop holes for her. I suspect it will cause conflict but perhaps it will send her down the path of challenging custody as it stands today which is not necessarily a bad thing. I feel extremely confident in my position as a primary parent and know that I do much more than my  the court would surely see this.Of course ideally she just agrees to leave it as is but I am certainly prepared either way. ,Custody,d3af5lu,1,t5_2rz0i

7869234,0,t3_4n2vyy,First thing that jumps out at me is how much about you this is and how much about your son it isnt.  gtMy  year old who loved his dad is distraught as he cant understand why his dad hasnt contacted him in  months.but then... gt It has been extremely nice not having him around but I do worry he will just walk in one day and say he wants our son.I would reach out to dad and let him know that his son misses him.  I would talk to dad about modifying the court order to reflect the status quo.  I would bend over backwards to facilitate any relationship between father and son.  I would absolutely follow the court order.  Whats more important to you?  Your pride or your sons well being?,Custody,d40kp9q,2,t5_2rz0i
8274337,0,t1_d5b5zie,I know its frustrating. But you are doing the right thing.You are. Things like her DV record are tangible evidence of potential harm. No good now but maybe good later. Things like them splitting up and you taking the kids for a month no good by itself but definitely weight on the scale with other things as well. It all adds up if your ex is a fuck up eventually it shows. Persistence and good record keeping pay off in the end. ,Custody,d5bumx2,1,t5_2rz0i
8455153,0,t3_4veq98,You took photos and that is good. A three year old childs account of an event will be taken with abuse grain of salt by the authorities I am warning you now. However you immediately need to call CPS or DCFS or whatever the child welfare service in your area is called and report it. Ask specifically for an investigation. Then you hot foot it to the courthouse tomorrow morning first thing and file an ex parte for immediate suspension of visitation pending the outcome of the investigation. You will wait in the courthouse all day to be heard he the judge. You will be required to notify the other parent via phone call. While you are waiting to be heard by the judge call your lawyer if you have one call a new one if you dont and can afford it. You can get through this Pro Se but I dont recommend it. Get a lawyer if you can. Once you have the change in custody ordered start putting together your case for supervised visitation with the mother. Or if you have enough no visitation at all though thats a lot harder than most people assume it is. That your daughter has visible marking is in your favour but her brother did it not the mother. At best youre looking at neglect. Base your desire for supervised visitation on things like her all of supervision your inability to get her to give you an address you have every right to know where your child sleeps overnight when your child is not with you. Even if your ex has a restraining order against you barring you from having her home address you still have a right to know where the child is at all times. I know I had to give my ex my address despite the fact that he only had visitation no custody no overnights and I have a DVRO against him.Build your case. Child services will take less time than the average time between court hearings to complete their investigation provided they can locate the other parent. As long as the investigation is open you can push court dates out and that gives you more time to prepare. And above all remember that this is about the best interests of the child. Dont attack the other parent directly. Frame everything with the phrase best interests of the child and you should be fine. ,Custody,d5yfgo6,2,t5_2rz0i
9311584,0,t1_d8w9d68,Start journaling your involvement. Keep it in a safe place where it wont be read. My SO created a separate email address for himself and every night he creates an email from himself to himself with the date. He puts in a short paragraph about what time he left amp came home from work what he did with the kid who cooked dinner homeworkbedtimebathtimebonding routine stuff. Anything out of the ordinary like tonight they are going on a hike. Last week he took him to the dentist for a cleaning. Whenever possible he also downloads a picture from the day from his phone and includes that as an attachment to the email. He now has over a years worth of documented journaled parenting time with his son and since its emailed to himself it is all date and timestamped as well. That is a good first step for you. A solid  months of daily parenting time journaled and tracked will be significant. Continue to give the mother breaks as often as possible. Winwin in that you get more time with your kid and she spends less time with a mean mother.And start pocketing that fine money for yourself. Open a separate bank account and put it there. If you can make her monthly fine payments then you can set that money aside for an attorney. Youre going to need it and you know that so you might as well get ahead of the game. Mother going to jail for probation violation and not paying her fines would actually be a very tidy  and helpful way to jumpstart your case. You do not need to feel bad about that. You did not make her get in trouble. You did not make her not get a job. You are not responsible for her choosing to not get a job now. She is a grown woman. Your only responsibility is to pay for and protect your infant daughter.,Custody,d8wb8dr,1,t5_2rz0i

9791499,0,t3_5ed9yc,Ok... I went through something similar also in Ontairo.First doctors as well as police do not want to be in the middle of domestic issues.  Its not their job to enforce custody orders.  While most will try to work with you if it starts becoming intrusive to their job theyll say you figure it out.  I dont like this answer but I get it.I also agree with the response earlier to NOT withhold medication while your child is with you for the same reasons stated.What I did was Send a formal letter to the Dr stating that you have joint custody.  If you have an order attach a copy. If de facto attach a letter from your lawyer. Advise the Dr that you appreciate that its not hisher job to enforce custody but you expect to be informed of and included in all appointments. Copy your ex on the above were building a paper trail here Document. Document. Document. Everything she does that is against the order especially seeking nonurgent medical treatment.  Your ex will say it is urgent but the college of surgeons has a definition of this. If this behaviour from your ex keeps up file a motion with have custody temporarily granted to you.  This will most likely be denied but youll now have court records.  Repeat. If you really want Dr visits to stop file a complaint with the College of Surgeons and send all documentation.  You are being deliberately kept out of your childs medical treatment and some potentially serious meds are being prescribed.NOTE This is a bit of a nuclear approach but it WILL get the attention of the Dr your ex and her lawyer. Most importantly watch your child for behavioural changes. Negative OR positive.  Perhaps meds are the way to go but like you I would consider that my last option after many medical opinions and treatment options.Unfortunately there is no quick answer here.  You have to document the hell out of everything and ultimately convince a judge that your ex is not acting in the childs best interests.I won sole custody and the vast majority of access in similar situations and it took a LONG time.  I started a blog to brain dump some of my experiences but they frown on promoting personal links here.  Youve inspired me to write up something relevant similar to your situation.I could go on but hopefully you get the point.  Happy to chat anytime.,Custody,dak0jy8,1,t5_2rz0i
