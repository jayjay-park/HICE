Its primary positive attribute is a gimmick. There are much much better builds for zero.And nobody needs a legendary to get through UVHM story missions.

The general argument thats brought up for other games is that players with a Keyboard  Mouse would be better than those with a controller but since Borderlands is a coop experience like Portal  I dont think that would be a problem. Plus long gone are the days where patches on consoles were impossible making it hard to keep them in sync with the PC version  TF comes to mind.

Sorry.gtSee what I did there? FAN BASE. Want to give criticism and ideas?

Why should I have to pen anything when twitter is right there?gtGoing on twitter or facebook to share your ideas on how to run a company or make a game is just plain superfluous.Im not giving ideas on how to run a company Im offering suggestions of failings that led to crappiness in a few good games and a few crappy games.

I love all  of them. Yes they were rough around the edges but thats because all except TTAoDK was outsourced but still they were great.

Past the UVHM upgrade and the OP levels which were just poorly thought out and designed to appease. I wasnt saying all the DLCs just the latter ones the ones designed for profit milking not the ones included in the season pass duh.gtBut use your head quit trolling and if you have great ideas on how something is to be run then deal with it in a serious way or you will be treated like every snot nosed kit with a crying voice and bitch slapped from his twitter. Be an adult and ye shall be treated as such.You are just pathetic. Why should I respond to this crap?

First few levels are a bit of a challenge but once you get some skill points in things really turn around. Great survivability both solo and MP exceedingly good damage and in my opinion the most fun of playable characters.Oh and my main tip would be try and get a friend to duplicate you a legendary class mod. Even at  my level  legendary class mod still keeps me going strong.,Borderlands2,cfkfh7l,5,t5_2spu9

PC can only play in splitscreen offline and with certain programs so it is easier to pass items through ClapTraps Stash.I know PS and XBox can play in splitscreen.I do it all the time.EDIT I was saying that a player higher than level  can find better weapons than that Harold and dont cost as much ammo.I was not saying it takes until level  to get to Sanctuary.Ive made it to Sanctuary much earlier than that.And  levels is about as far as you can make a low level Legendary work in Normal mode.It gets worse in TVHM and really worse in UVHMabout  levels for most level  Legendaries,Borderlands2,cfn82ls,2,t5_2spu9

1010684,0,t1_chj3ohz,The events were not created to counterbalance the low drop rates.Events would have been done for a game that had nonexistant drop rates or rates that were specific to given areasdailyweekly happenings.The lowered drop rates are to create the feel of legendary gear. That and they still have a decent drop rate in the first place.  drop rate in the base game further increased as you go higher up.They did fix some parts of duping but the issue is that they had no reason to focus on it so they didnt worry about it. You can do it in BL and there is no way to really fix someone just dropping gear and pressing AltF.,Borderlands2,chj67qw,1,t5_2spu9

The skins are your reference.I would do the main story and then the DLCs.Dont farm until the level cap.Leveling tips dont grind just play.Golden Keys a few ever few levels they get less useful the higher level you are.Gaige is awesome.  I havent played Zero but have heard he is awesome too.  Actually every character can be awesome depending on your playstyle.Soloing bosses is doable.  Soloing raid bosses is really hard.Main story and side quests first DLCs next.  You can look up the starting locations for each online.General tips see the sidebar.Skill tree tips google.Rare weapon locations  quests BL wiki.Anything else just play.  Dont worry too much during PT.  Heck I wouldnt really even worry during TVHM.  Tips and FAQs are good but nothing beats personal experience.

Makes everything much too easy especially if you use weapons like the Fibber or Sandhawk.However the damage boost is nice for soloing raid bosses and helps if you really need to do damage. Otherwise I dont use it much  all I need is the Rough Rider shield!  Shield power  max health and I get to activate super speed too.

I was not expecting all these replies in my inbox. also I know I dont play the character exactly how he should be played but thats the fun of the game is to spec him however you feel comfortable and I feel most comfortable using the bee instead of the normal hide behind turret and grenadierexplosive axton.,Borderlands2,ck06t2n,3,t5_2spu9
1756369,0,t1_ck0iasz,Each gun and shield manufacturer has one full set of parts for each gunshield they make. However nearly every gun mixes and matches.The main body of the gun determines the manufacturer and thus the guns behavior but the barrel determines which model it becomes for example a Maliwan pistol with a Jakobs barrel will always be a torment or a Dahl Sniper with a Hyperion barrel will always be a Strike. All of the parts affect the guns stats usually based on the manufacturers gimmick so Vladof parts improve fire rate Hyperion parts improve accuracy and so on.There are other parts that arent brand specific and these are often the first part of the guns name. This prefix changes between manufacturers so a dubble bandit pistol and a Binary Maliwan both have the same dualshot accessory. This gun has the Etech barrel and Bandit body but appears to have the Hyperion trigger and stock which is good for plasma casters as it will increase the elemental chance.A ways back a guy made infographics for all the parts. check them outPistolsSMGShotgunsAssault RiflesSniper RiflesRocket launchers,Borderlands2,ck0jqi0,13,t5_2spu9

1874041,0,t3_2g2hn5,Gaiges main draw is the anarchy tree. Id read the anarchy talent if I were you just so you understand what it all entails but basically you never reload your gun manually and every time the clip empties or you kill someone you get another stack. If you reload manually before you get to discard mid level game changer then you lose your stacks. Stacks can go up to  with talents  without and up to  with the slayer of terraAnarchy is a very different way to play the game which is why I liked it so much. With every stack you get more powerful but also less accurate.My preferred guns with her are Jacobs shotguns. She has talents that reduce her magazine size these are mandatory to progress in the tree and so a  round magazine will drop to  and an ornery coach gun fires  shots at a time so every shot gives you a new stack. Sometimes you have to dance behind cover while reloading this is more important for ultimate vault hunter. Keep the stacks going and use death trap as a bullet shield and youll breeze right to level . Shes pretty OP.Avoid guns with large magazines. Accuracy doesnt matter.Heres an example tree up to  I avoid increasing his move speed unless I have a class mod for it anarchy class mods are kind of shitty and seem to focus on that one as well as Death From Above which I dont like too much as it costs stacks and the explosion isnt particularly game changing.Funny side note the infinity becomes worthless with her since its clip becomes ,Borderlands2,ckf0k82,2,t5_2spu9

3663820,0,t1_cq9p4em,Its.....ok.  Well Ill elaborate a bit. A lot of people have this misconception that crit buffs will out perform base damage buffs as long as you hit a crit. This is not true. For example you are almost always better off using a damage prefix over the crit prefix. Skookum instead of Tumtum  This changes off you use something like the Bee but if youre not using that youre better off using a decent Jakobs like a Muckamuck or something.  Now you might think but critical ascension should make the Hawkeye better right? Wrong. As you increase your critical ascension the disparity between crit damage and base damage increases. Now Im not saying the Hawkeye is bad you can definitely get shot kills with it but it requires more precise gameplay to achieve this.  Now all that being said I do enjoy playing with the Hawkeye but Zer has better options at his disposal. Disclaimer All of this is in regards to Zer I do not know how the Hawkeye performs on other characters so most of this may appear to be false information to nonZer players. ,Borderlands2,cq9wf3e,1,t5_2spu9

A singularity grenade can help with this.Once you have ruinconverge an AoE weapon will come in handy for grouped enemies as youll be able to shoot straight into a pile of slagged enemies.As far as bosses and straight DPS goes youll most likely want a Cat build. Not a lot of skills go with this but most importantly youll want a Cat or Leg Cat class mod. If youre using elements with this Bone of Ancient relics are best if youre not stick to an SMG Aggression relic.For guns Id recommend a Sandhawk or multiple elements and a slagga for the DPS fights.

4143421,0,t1_crsfaom,Fair enough to each their own.  In direct response to your question the fastest ways to level quickly or more quickly than naturally playing are Have someone help power level you.  e.g. You join their OP Bar Brawl mission and hang out by the vending machines while they wreak havoc and gain massive XP points. Play through naturally only focusing on things that give you high XP points BNKR Warrior rabid enemies etc. Gibbed Youtubeother save gameThat being said as umarklithikk said the game will become much more difficult and you might find yourself wanting to be back in TVHM.  Hundreds of hours ago I thought it would be cool to check out Krieg so I dl an OP build.  I had NO CLUE WTF I WAS DOING because I hadnt experimented on my own and learned his mechanics naturally.  So I had the perfect character but didnt know how to play him.  I see OP Sals that dont know how to health gate trying to run Digi and they are getting wrecked because they dont know what theyre doing.Check out the sidebar for builds and learn the mechanics of the game.

It sounds like you are going Mania so youll want Feed the Meat and Empty the Rage as fast as possible Meat gives you health which youll need to survive and Rage is great melee damage. If you are in coop consider skipping Fuel the Rampage unless you REALLY trust your partner but otherwise it is a great skill to have early as it gives you much more rampages. Once you have these Buzz Axe Rampage is off cooldown when you need it and you can use the built in health regen on kill to kill most enemies.For quests the Incinerator Clayton questline gives an amazing shield for Krieg and any bladed  melee damage gun will help you greatly.,Borderlands2,csiu1jr,5,t5_2spu9

4518547,0,t3_3cux99,Youve done what I would try doing so Im not sure. zark said to restart windows and sometimes the simplest thing to do is the proper fix. bb might also be right. If the save was corrupted and the game didnt know how to identify it the default character is Axton so his explanation would make sense and I would give what he said to do a go. If that works and you lose progress or if nothing works you could use gibbed to build characters back to where they were or remake them. In a wosrt case scenario you might have to delete your saves and profile. It would be a bit of a pain in the butt but youd be able to build up your characters to right where they were in terms of BA rank lvl gear and questplay through.Anyways I hope you get your characters back.

5237981,0,t3_3mqwoe,Went through this myself. You will need gibbed but also a program called Brute Force to deencrypt the PS saved file. Then once you get the PS save working you need to do a cross save and then upload your character from your PS then download the cross save to your PS. There are lots of tutorials on YouTube. You just have to make sure you dont skip any steps otherwise it wont work. Took me a few hours to really get the hang of it.  You cannot do this using just gibbed alone.I listed out the steps to help out someone elseFor you youd need to do a few things before you go to the steps belowCopy your save to a USB drive and then use either Modio or Horizon to extract your .SAV fileOpen your .SAV file using gibbed selecting xbox as your platform then change it to PS and save that file.    Copy save to USB    Copy the save from USB to Desktop    Use Bruteforce to decrypt PFD    Open .SAV file in Gibbed edit then save. Do not rename the save file use existing name    In Bruteforce click Update PFD all    Verify PFD Rebuild is not necessary    Copy the modified save folder on your Desktop to USB drive overwrite all files    Eject your USB drive    Plug USB drive back into PS and copy to System Storage,Borderlands2,cvhd7nz,2,t5_2spu9

5262988,0,t3_3n1vth,For best chances to spawn either play in UVHM and play with the  player difficulty on or with  actual peoplefor OOO You can just pay the iridium to spawn Dexiduous. There will be a few waves of lesser enemies to fight before Dex spawns. The last wave contains  Badass Savages and  witch doctors usually badass witch doctors Wait and watch the WD level the savages. When the go to level from Ultimate Badass Savages if they heal instead then just leave the area becuase OOO will not spawn. You can take a fan boat back over to the other side of the board by the path leading to The Bulwark You can then go back to where the badasses are and they will have deleveled. You can repeat this an infinite amount of times. Even if OOO spawns you can kill him and when you return there will still be  badasses to level.for Vermi Most people suggest the farmhouse as the best way to spawn him and they may be right. I prefer caustic caverns. Forget about the door to the left Just run past the varkids at the entrance towards the acid pools off to the right. Just before the second bridge a Crystalisk will spawn. You can get the crystalisk to agro on the varkids. Once they are fighting just run off into the acid fields and sit wait and watch. You can pull up a timer to be more efficient. Spawn Times are listed on the wiki The farm may have more varkids but trying to keep them aggroed can be a pain. In the caverns you can just run in and then sit and wait.

5316420,0,t1_cvr56yx,My bad I completely read your post wrong. I thought you were asking why the fire one has a higher damage on the card. But yeah it all factors down to what resists what. Also gun parts the way this game generates random guns with so much variety is that each gun has several parts that affect the card stats of the weapon.  Vladof Rifles may have different stats because one rifle has a bandit stock and Jakob grip while the other has a Dahl stock and Dahl grip. If you look around the sub you should fine some info graphics which help you identify gun parts. But again i read your post wrong so this isnt really relevant to your question ,Borderlands2,cvr8h8q,1,t5_2spu9

5347152,0,t1_cvupdow,I cant help you with how to play zero as I havent tried him... I dont know his strengths and weaknesses... But its totally possible to get through this... Ive played with many ppl much much higher then where u are..... But just make sure the enemies arent out levelling you... If they have a skull next to their name you are gonna struggle to kill them... Dont worry about your shield and health... Your hp and shield capacity are where they should be.. The game is pretty good in the levelling.. Providing you have an up to date shield... If they are melee badasses try getting a nova shield...  The blast might give u a bit of extra damage.. Or if my memory serves well doesnt zero have quite strong melee? A roid shield might help to.. A  slag weapon is pretty good... Most weapons wont give u more then that... Except thing like grog nozzle and maybe a rubi.... If they are shielded enemies make sure you hit them with a shock weapon to really quickly get rid of their shield... Then switch it up to a fire weapon to burn them babies.... But make sure you keep updating your inventory..... It doesnt take long for a weapon to be quite underpowered....  Try getting your hands on some form of slag grenade if you dont wanna change weapons... A singularity might help if there is more then one.... Will help in grouping them.. Plus it also puts them off balance so its a little more time u have shooting at them when they arent shooting back..... Try heading back to the morrowfield in  horns.... Farm savage lee a bit and try get a Harold outta him....  In my opinion the  weapon everybody should have in the game.....  Have you put much thought into your build? Google some builds.. Couple points moved around here or there can make a big difference.... And lastly if you got online try get a few other vault hunters run it with you...... Hope this helps... ,Borderlands2,cvv5qi7,1,t5_2spu9

6955077,0,t1_d14eish,When you get into UVHM and slag is a necessity the grog  DPUH combo is fantastic. At that point in the game youd be foolish not to use at least some kind of slag weapon in your secondary hand and it might as well heal you. The Rubi will also do this. If you want to go dual SMG Id try for a Slagga Slagged Bitch or Slagged Bone Shredder for your secondary weapon. Bone shredder is obviously going to be the easiest to get but its pretty late in the story so it may not help you out in too many levels of UVHM. Slagga stands as a good choice throughout almost regardless of the level and a Slagged Bitch is going to be rare enough that it may not be that helpful that I even suggested it. Basically you want something with a very high rate of fire decent magazine size and relatively high chance to slag. In certain segments of regular gameplay I dont really enjoy Grog  DPUH that much its too easy. In certain circumstances you can jsut hold down the trigger on both guns and not even see what youre shooting at and youll come out unscathed. In mobs and against bosses its fantastic but I like some alternate setups for regular gameplay.  One gun I like to farm is the Gwens Head in a slag variant. You can target enemies from a small distance and then come in with the element that theyre susceptible to in both hands and take them out. Legendary guns are incredible but dont overlook some of the other lowerrarity guns in the game there are some fantastic guns out there. ,Borderlands2,d14ow87,1,t5_2spu9

You have stuff like the Antagonist shield and the Interfacer which are must haves on a lot of characters. You also have stuff like the Patriot and Sponge which are pretty much lesser versions of the Lyuda and Sham respectively.

What youre unfortunately experiencing are the few bosses in the game that can be a total pain in the ass to kill with melee and I know how frustrating it is because I was there once myself. Honestly with melee I feel like its similar to eating a meal you dont like. You put up with it for the desert at the end. After like level  and you get that many must fall stuff going on you should be fine to tear through the game. That being said zero is quite gear dependant so a rubigrog nozzle or law and order when used in conjunction with one another all melee damage given is converted to hp allowing for that easy tank is almost required . Also make sure you have some good hard hitting guns like a quad or something for when you need to use a gun. GL man,Borderlands2,d37ek2c,1,t5_2spu9

7788543,0,t3_4lfdlf,Speaking of guns in BL Introducing blast radius as part of the RL stats. Blast radius can altered with RL parts from different manufacturers e.g. Torgue RL parts increase rocket blast radius.     ADS on pistols ARs SMGs and shotguns have less tunnel vision effect.     The accuracy accessory for ARs able to tighten projectile spread and have a critical damage bonus.     Jakobs     . Jakobs RLs introduced in BL. The Jakobs RLs will have high base damage fast projectile speed and the only RLs that can crit at the expense of reduced splash damage small blast radius small magazine size and increased recoil. Think of them as a mix of a harpoon gun and a cannon. . I doubt there will Jakobs SMGs in the third game as they doesnt align with Jakobs philosophy. Even if they manufacture SMGs with high base and crit. damage low fire rate and have high recoil they will be to similar with the Jakobs ARs. Which makes them redundant. . Reduce the size of the wheel magazines for the Jakobs ARs they are too big and they clipped through characters like Maya. . Gearbox need to make a Legendary Jakobs AR with matching Jakobs barrel.     Torgue     . Increase the projectile speed for the Torgue guns. . Reintroduce Torgue SMGs and Snipers. . Torgue guns able to use other elements instead of only explosions. They will have high base and splash damage at the cost of low elemental effect chance.     SampS Munitions If Gearbox is planning to bring back SampS Munitions in BL they need make them different from Bandit guns while sharing the trait having large magazine size. What Gearbox can do is make the SampS Munitions have the reduced ammo consumption gimmick like the Vladof launchers. Each gun types have different Nth shots that will not consume ammo. They wont manufacture RLs just like in BL.     Bandit Just increase their base damage or projectiles per shot to be on par with other gun manufacturers.     Tediore     . Tediore shotguns are generally underwhelming compared to shotguns by other manufacturers plus their chucking damage isnt as potent as the other Tediore gun types. What Gearbox could do is increase the shotgun magazine size and increase the damage output. . Both Tediore RL barrel and exhaust should have some stat effects instead of none.,Borderlands2,d3rhm2d,1,t5_2spu9

7946175,0,t3_4o275d,You dont need legendaryunique gear or hundreds of stacks of Anarchy to excel with Gaige.  You do need good tactics and appropriate supporting gear.Cooking Up Trouble encourages a hit and run playstyle since you have to be at least temporarily out of the fight in order to use it.  edit or at least falling back to meleegrenades  If you use Blood Soaked Shields you will be weaker with every kill and without healing will eventually fall below the health gate threshold.  Consider Unstoppable Force instead which doesnt carry the health penalty and will help you get to cover to heal when you do need it.Discord is also a viable healing skill and unlike CUT works during the firefight.  A common way of taking advantage of this is by discord looping continually running Discord for the RoF buff and healing and using Rational Anarchist and Typecast Iconoclast to rebootstrap Anarchy when you exhaust it.There are three levels of Anarchy use in my opinion and only one of them requires Close Enough and Preshrunk Cyberpunk.  The first is very low Anarchy just enough to support the Discord loop described above.  The second is moderate Anarchy in the  stacks range.  Aiming still works and ADS is helpful to overcome Anarchys accuracy penalty.  Dahl weaponry supports this style well.  At the  level you may need to adjust your range of engagement.  The third level is massive Preshrunk type levels of Anarchy where the damage buff overcomes any Close Enough penalty and where youre usually caroming shots off of a wall or off the ground if youre attacking from  above so that any shots that miss the enemy have a chance to catch him on the rebound.  Here you do want Close Enough.An advantage of not taking Close Enough at all is that you get a better sense of the accuracy penalty as it develops with growing Anarchy since you see shots miss.  I only take it on characters that also spec into Preshrunk Cyberpunk in expectation of  stacks of Anarchy.  And that is not a foregone conclusion on my Gaige characters.  Moderate Anarchy will carry you through all of UVHM without drama.,Borderlands2,d4983f4,1,t5_2spu9

They must be affordable they must be available which is why the cost is always a percentage of your moneyHyperion manufactures them.  Hyperion cannot refuse service to a respawn station.  If they did theyd lose the ability to operate outside of the borderlands.  So its not worth Hyperion refusing to allow you to respawn.Pretty much every enemy respawns as well.  But dying is still possible through hunger or thirst or other methods.  Theres no water you respawn just to die again.

Not technically wrong but anyone with common sense would think that the first assassin only drops the Emperor and the others drop other weaponry. Whilst in fact all four can drop the Emperor and each have an unique drop on top of that. Scorpio  AFAIK no it does not shoot two bullets instead of one. It has variable burst fire whilst ADSing and variable RoF when hipfiring but thats it. AFAIK. Not  sure...Love Thumper  it had the lowest recharge delay in the game somewhere around  seconds  Find me a Love Thumper with that delay and Ill shit bricks. The lowest delay possible is . seconds. Also they failed to mention that the nova hurts allies. But seriously each time they state personal opinion as facts just make me cringe. Like seriously the Buffalo is worth saving for PT.?

The maths behind most of game mechanics is still a mystery and you shoudnt rely on the percentage values too much especially when youre talking about our Psycho class. From my Krieg experience I see no way to get such damage reduction. I used to play with this class a lot with Rough Rider RTB and ToB not NN since it was a pure meleeoriented build  Skin of the Ancients relic.

Shock and explosive will handle the few that you do. You kinda goofed by waiting this long to ask what to get. If go for the Sandhawk and Pimpernel youll overlevel assuming you havent started the Pirate DLC. Since idk what youve done so far you can grab a Lascaux a Good Touch and hit up the Golden Chest a few times.

10346037,0,t3_5o5020,Best Aspects.  Handsome Jack is an AWESOME villain..  Most guns of any game..  Characters are hilarious..  Easily replayable and encouraged.The game definitely promotes exploration but it is slightly restrictive.  On your first playthrough its nothing too bad but going from NVHM to TVHM to UVHM you understand why because enemies will destroy your ass if youre not careful.  The game does feature checklist missions oddly enough but its done in a way that doesnt make it seem horridly boring like in MMORPGs.  Its not like Here go collect stuff then come to me then go back to the same area with this new mission then come to me.  THEN go back to the same area for a different missions then back to me.  You can take all the quests available from an NPC do them and return all at once completing everything.  Gearbox likes to keep you interesting by either throwing in some story details or just giving you a laughing fit while you quest.As you might know theres  levels need both Vault Hunter DLCs for level .  The game goes further by adding in OP levels maxing out a .  The enemies will go  levels up and you will remain at level .

10755480,0,t3_5tupv8,The Avenger is unique in a couple ways that directly effect throws. For starters it bounces like a rubberized grenade. Second I believe it has been confirmed that the number of bullets in the gun when it is thrown determines the distance at which it will blow up. You may note in raid boss speed kills that guys like Demonite and Dinafay will set up at a specific distance often using a mini landmark to note the sweet spot distance. A clump of grass Hyperius arena for example. Each of these increases the difficulty of using the Avenger for chuck kills while mobbing. Generally speaking the Baby Maker wins for mobbing and the Avenger only gets used for bosses who start out stationary Hyperius Voracidous. ,Borderlands2,ddpchwe,7,t5_2spu9

I got through with maya by slagging enemies ruin and eventually scorn you can try to get a slagga from the hodunks if you havent already done the clan war quest and sided with the zafords having a cat com and going back for a good touch.  As soon as you can get a legendary cat com it might be a good idea to try for it as that spiked my DPS by a lot.  Legendary cat class mod  slag  good touch is enough damage to rip through most enemies if youre landing crits thanks to the boosted crit damage from good touch.

Also for me the one on the left is better due to the higher amp damage lower delay to have the shield charging back up sooner and the faster recharge time. As for shield size this isnt as important on the bee. Once the shield has been hit you lose all of the boosted damage regardless of size. Oh and one more thing about delay its not that big of a deal on Axton because of his shield buffs in his tree. This is only my opinion.,Borderlands2,de7t5b4,3,t5_2spu9
