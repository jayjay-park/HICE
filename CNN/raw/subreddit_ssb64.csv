5949490,0,t3_3wwltk,Dealing with Kirbys up tilt as Yoshi is quite tough. In terms of moves that beat it theres his neutral B which can actually outrange it but thats quite risky for low reward so in the end probably not a good strategy but keep it in mind as an option to go for if needed. Otherwise you can try to dash attack. Depending on the timing you might hit them and set up a tech chase or combo or you might clank and at least not get punished. You can also try to hit him with a DJC fair or bair between utilts but thats really difficult and if youre just slightly too late or early you will get punished.,ssb64,cxzib9v,8,t5_2vipt

6120598,0,t1_cylc75v,Definitely not the norm though I can slightly relate. My favorite  controller is garbage. I got it in  and I still use it. I have no idea why but for some reason that controller has joystick sensitivity that no other joystick can reproduce. In  the joysticks are pretty much shot. The left joy stick reads up and to the left at neutral and the dead zone on the right is completely gone. The problem was that I was poor in  so I didnt buy a new one. The issue now is that Im used to the no deadzone on the right stick for  since I used it for so long and now that same controller has a broken left bumper the rubber on the left stick is completely gone and it wont sync to any other xboxs but my own xbox so I cant use it for any LAN events. I dont use it anymore unless Im in an online tournament where Im doing poorly and need a pick me up because using it is pretty detrimental to LAN play. The xbox has a default deadzone of  but for some reason that broken piece of shit controller has no deadzone and I love it. Ive personally gone through  n and  gamecube controllers and I dont play every day. The most recent  were bought new after I was over  so its not my adolescence that broke them. And as for xbox... I have  xbox controllers and   controllers... Ive tried them all. Madcats razer scuf jap they all break. My most recent controller of months broke on day  razer sabre left stick doesnt return to neutral on its own though Im use to returning the stick to neutral by now because of all the other faulty ones. The  controllers just fucking suck though its always the damn left joystick. I dont even rough it up like you dont have to do anything more intense than dash dancing in smash. Here is a picture I have saved on this comp Now that might seem like a lot of controllers but Im not even on the high end of the spectrum. Fucking mk brought a whole box of controllers to a tournament... That box I have is for all the chumps who forget their controller when they come over they get to pick from the litter... edit I didnt buy all those controllers people quit  leave them at my house and never claim. tho i have bought all the popular brands jsut to try them,ssb64,cylck70,3,t5_2vipt

11365035,0,t3_624mla,I wouldnt say puff is easycheap but would say that she is a very simple character go for dairs neutral airs or grabs in neutral follow up into a rest combo. I think people view puff as cheap because of the easiest zero to death in the game against people that cant DI or cant DI well. A couple variations of down air gt ultilt gt rest is super strong at low and mid level. Puff is more balanced than other characters because her frame data isnt the greatest especially compared to Kirby and dies very early can be edgeguarded until she runs out of jumps.Pick up Kirby or falcon if you want another relatively simple character with easy  to deaths and easy punishes. Character selection really just comes down to personal preference though.,ssb64,dfk7e7f,1,t5_2vipt
