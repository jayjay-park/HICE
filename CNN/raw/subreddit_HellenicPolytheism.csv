7810566,0,t3_4maf7h,gtalso why arent we as big as heathenry and asatru considering how much lore you have?Heathenry and Asatru had a headstart. That revival began in the s. The revival of Hellenic polytheism is more recent.gthow are your relationships with the divine and ancestors similar and different from heathenry?From what I understand about heathenry and I could be wrong many heathens dont believe that the gods care about humanity or have much to do with individual peoples lives. Hellenic polytheism to me from my limited knowledge of it is different. Though traditionally there wasnt commonly a sense of patron or matron deities i.e. an individual having a oneonone relationship with a specific god especially in a devotional context  that definitely seems to be the norm for modern Hellenic polytheism.Perhaps more traditional groups like Labrys in Greece dont emphasize that but much of the material on Hellenic polytheism in the Anglophone world does.There seems to be a much more masculinecentered focus to Heathenism than Ive seen in Hellenic polytheism. But of course thats just cultural and a modernday view of things.,HellenicPolytheism,d3tz06n,4,t5_2vyl2
