7418150,0,t3_4guslf,Pick a colors out from the other room and bring it into the kitchen with the indooroutdoor rug and some complimentary kitchen mats in front of the sink andor stove. Also that room seems to have lovely sunlight so think about adding some plants above the shelves Pothos would be easy to take care of. Or some bigger pieces of pottery etc. really just to break up the space and give it some dimension. Think about a table runner or place mats on the table. With a pretty vase or decorative jar. Any combination of these will add some color before youre ready to commit to a paint color. Good luck! ,HomeDecorating,d2le9bm,3,t5_2t8de
7510413,0,t3_4i74wr,Grey can be tricky because when youre decorating with it if you pick other colors that are cool toned sometimes it can make the room feel cold. I think these colors are great. I do like the second one Buff It a little better. Its hard to see without it being together.,HomeDecorating,d2vwa73,1,t5_2t8de

8941809,0,t3_52rnu3,I cant imagine any that do having any sort or weight capacity. Buy a set of garage shelves that can be easily assembled and taken down or talk to your landlord about leaving them after you move the. You get the shelves you want and she gets shelving for the next tenant. ,HomeDecorating,d7mo9ji,3,t5_2t8de

10221870,0,t1_dc2ia78,Nice pics that colour of teal is beautiful!  The one thing I dont think we can do is cover the sofa... we have a couple of cats that despite our best efforts they like to claw our furniture so the gray hides a multitude of sins!  I like your ideas on spraying frames and have actually already repainted the entertainment centre  ,HomeDecorating,dc2pfbn,1,t5_2t8de
10294959,0,t1_dcaza0q,Thanks! Yes with the larger sofa I think  chairs becomes crowded. However I assume its better with chair opposite of the chaise portion? If thats the case... which orientation?I didnt think furniture layout would be so damn difficult! But if spending K on a sofa and more on other pieces... gotta get it right!,HomeDecorating,dcazmt3,1,t5_2t8de
10522285,0,t1_dd0r2pg,jewel tones are basically the colors you would see in cut and polished gems. think the deep sultry color of a ruby or the deepwater blue of a sapphire or the rich purple of an amethyst. they are very rich pigmented colors but not ones that are bright and clashing. they can be matte or satin or even glittery if thats your preference! its more a reference to the color itself than its finish though i personally believe jewel tones look best in matte or satin finishes because it really allows you to appreciate the beauty of the color itself. here are a few examples of jeweltoned colors!good luck with decorating your loft! its a beautiful place im sure you will have a great time making it your own!,HomeDecorating,dd0tc67,2,t5_2t8de

11040438,0,t1_dejerpm,Ive considered switching to a laptop but I feel like Id still want to keep a desk for itwork so the desk would probably have to stay anyway. I am renting but I doubt the landlord would have an issue with holes in the walls theres so many in them already this place really is not in great shape. Ill look into wall mounting the TV because I really do want it out of the way of the window.,HomeDecorating,dejex64,4,t5_2t8de
11420763,0,t3_6272ae,I would slide the desk down the wall o be further away from the dining table.  I would buy a picture of a map similar in size and color to the other picture you have and hang it above your desk. I bought a nice poster of a map at Walmart and it could be framed.  Not a fan of the white chairs. Do you have any tag sales or second stores where you could buy a few wooden ones.  If you cant match the wood of the table you could paint the chairs black.  paint your desk black too.  and add an off white rug to the area.,HomeDecorating,dfqj5my,0,t5_2t8de
