Shooting Star was added as a subtitle in for the US release to differentiate it from the original manga series. The original Japanese manga all the chapters were called Shoots without titles. The English version adds movie titles to each chapter instead of song titles like in the anime.So the other  are the original manga that just gave more short episodes to the show where Shooting Star was more like a reimagining.  ,cowboybebop,co3e0wj,2,t5_2sn1i

7574205,0,t3_4izysu,The ones that come to mind are      and .Episode  is specifically built to introduce the series to everyone without it being overwhelming. The Asimov fight is really great.Episode  has a dog and who doesnt love dogs? Plus its got some humor to it.Episode  may or may not be the best idea to show due to it being a plot driver but Ballad of Fallen angels is definitely going to attract their attention if theyre into action movies.Episode  is a fan favorite Episode  is one of my personal favorites because it involves a lot of space rather than being in the Bebop or on a planet. Its a good episode to drive the point that they do a lot of their work in space and travel around.Also man Cowboy Funk is such a hilarious episode good episode if they enjoy humor because man it makes me laugh every time.Hopefully they enjoy the series from what you decide to show them!

10927236,0,t1_de6t0lm,As a first time watcher you wont notice the difference and the series narrative isnt affected.  Im in the midst of studying the differences in detail and will be dumping my findings soon.  Both the older DVDs and the HD versions have their plus points and flaws and in my mind it depends what you mean by changes since some of the differences are even restorative.  In terms of edits they removed some footage originally added to pad out episodes for broadcast and reedited some sequences for tighter pacing.  The knock on effect of this is that some music cues had to be adjusted for time but theyre usually pretty close.  The majority of the  episodes in HD are actually just about identical as the original version in terms of content just make sure that your sound systemcomputer is mixing the surround mix down to stereo if you only have two speakers and youll be fine on that front.They made a dedicated transfer of the footage from the original film masters rather than a laserdisc master used on the DVDs so the frame isnt only bigger but also slightly wider in scope and the colour balance and contrast is much closer to the original cels than the footage on the older DVDs barring the UK BDs which are the ones with a slightly washed out look. They remastered the music and went to the extra effort of reverting and correcting some sound edits in the older version of the english dub.,cowboybebop,de72gbk,3,t5_2sn1i
