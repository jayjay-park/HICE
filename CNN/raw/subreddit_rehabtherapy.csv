6352279,0,t1_czbohul,Ok but when are NSAIDs really needed according to the latest research? My understanding based on extensive research I have had to do in order to know enough to recognize a provider who could actually help me after wasting a ton of time with many who couldnt is that by the time pain shows up with overuse injuries tendinopathy the damage has already started. There is rarely even any visible macrolevel swelling with tendinopathy. It makes zero sense to suggest NSAIDs to me. Inhibiting prostaglandins in the acute stage also seems counterintuitive because if there is a micro inflammatory response it is there to promote healing. And there is some research to suggest NSAIDs can impair healing.The issue is with disorganized collagen.Im not here to cause problems. I just want to know why this information hasnt gotten around like what is the issue? Because its bad news for patients who wind up losing precious healing time. Like cortisone shots literally everyone knows they make things worse but people are still getting these shots in clinics all over the place. Is it because no one wants to say we dont really understand why this happens and were not  sure what will help yet?,rehabtherapy,czbomef,5,t5_2s9mx
