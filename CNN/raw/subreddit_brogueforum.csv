5575495,0,t3_3retp2,Im sure he is working on it but I actually dont get the same impression from .. as I did from previous versions.In .. changes to allies made ally builds a clearly superior choice and we saw many multilumen runs and masteries in the contests. This could just be we had really great players but probably not. So it was pretty clear Pender would be balancing this.In .. I think this was when stealth was originally added or retweaked? It also needed some work so it was pretty clear some changes would be coming.For the current version I really love the balance and challenge of all of the various builds.

Even at  you still cant stealth kill a dragon in one hit. I would rather have had that weapon Griselbrand mentioned that I didnt know about. The way I died has made me reconsider whether the warhammer is worth it. Its the weapon with the highest strength requirement yet when there are a dozen dragons roaming about a floor you cant afford to be missing out on a turn from swinging it.Laying low in a dooredoff room I was waiting to recover health not particularly worried about dying since clairvoyance would reveal any enemies approaching. A dar battlemage popped his head in the door. A casual swing of the warhammer took care of him. And then I was suddenly dead.

9224634,0,t3_56p58x,Very rare from what I understand. I saw it happen in a seed contest a long time ago. The place where the dungeon entrance would normally spawn... is it blocked off by some sort of obstruction ex. pit? IIRC stairs are one of the last things to be placed during floor generation even after terrain features such as pits and lakes. If the bottom wall is bordered by such terrain the generator has to find a new spot to place the entrance and it can end up sometimes in the middle of the level.Edit Yup... looked at the seed... theres a pit in the way so the entrance cannot be where it would normally be. Penders level generation script is pretty smart that way...,brogueforum,d8lagsf,2,t5_39htf

9855067,0,t3_5ggok7,If you knew for a fact that the only staff you were going to get was the conjuration then there probably would be an optimal spread of the enchants. But as TR pointed out the other staves you have or might end up having are a very important factor. If you have several staves with small enchants on them like  or  and they are staves that can save your ass in a pinch then you would want to go even heavier on wisdom or spread some enchants over to those staves as well. I cant tell you how many times a  staff of obstruction have saved my ass or that  firebolt has kept me from being gassed or cleared an entire level filled with creep.But in general from having played many builds focused on those two items I can say from experience a  conj staff  a  or higher wisdom ring means you should coast for the first  levels. Once I get deeper I find that I end up spamming blades significantly more amp start fizzling and thus Id rather have a  or higher on both. There is a certain point where the enchant level doesnt matter anymore because you always have a charge ready when you need it and its not far from  at least up to D. Ive done at least a few ascensions with the  combo. You cant underestimate the importance of other utility items like obstruction blink firebolt tunnel etc...My opinion is that the conjuration staff is the most powerful staff but also the slowest. The main problems with the conjuration staff are. Nagas basically immune to them unless paralyzed.. Horrors regen almost as fast as the damage from  swords surrounding it.. Revnants.. Dragons also are pretty hard to kill with them but I have done it and the blades also block you from getting flamed so that makes up for it a bit. BUT if you have  or more dragons your fecked. They destroy the blades too fast to kill either  of the dragons. More or less the same with Horrors.. Golems take too long to kill youll die of starvation while waiting for the golem to be killed but the easy solution is spam the golem and leave.Anyways nos  is why you really want other utility items and perhaps spend some enchants on them.Id say that to a large degree the conjuration staff stops being very offensive and becomes more defensive the deeper you go. Its often better to block powerful enemies with a wall of blades and flee then it is to whittle them down. It just takes too long to kill a couple dragons or horrors or golems. Horrors are easy if you have another damage stave like poison  firebolt. Golems you dont want to shoot anything at them other than conj blades dont ask me what happened that time I shot a  staff of poison at a golem and those will take too long to kill with just blades. Multiple dragons are a real pain. I recently had a game with a conj staff and I was on D and I kept running into  dragons at a time not to mention packs of golems horrors and liches wandering into the room in the middle of every fight. And I could just not damage them more than about  after about  minutes of spamming blades. I BARELY got out alive and was happy I escaped with  lumenstones. I not only had something like a  conj  wisdom but I also had a  whip of quietus it was one of the most fun games Ive ever played. But everytime a gap would open and I could go for a whip shot on one of the dragons I got flamed and so I had to close the gap again with more swords in order to heal. This went on for...ages. I just got tired of the cycle and headed up.,brogueforum,das4zba,4,t5_39htf

10398631,0,t3_5ov1po,Im impressed that tiny has managed to use a guardian charm as a main part of his strategy. But that doesnt change that its probably the worst option for a build to be centered around o Ive never taken a guardian charm from a vault and never will. If I happen to have one Ill make use of it but Id never pump an enchant into it NEVER! o I think just about ANY other charm except maybe shattering! would be better to invest enchants into. In fact I have used teleport invisibility haste negation teleport amp recharging charms as a main part of my build with success! Any weapon better than a dagger would be a better investment of scrolls. Any armor better than chain mail would be a better investment. Id rather spend  enchants on ANY staff other than healing amp protection than a guardian charm. Id say youd have to be pretty desperate to start pumping up a guardian charm. The only reason to do a guardian charm centered build is to give yourself a challenge because yes almost ANYTHING else would be a better investment of enchants...As tiny pointed out if you are seen the guardian automatically becomes  useless as everything just runs away and takes little to no damage and then run right back at you after the guardian runs out. The only real use of guardian charms in most cases is to give you some space and cause monsters to flee so you can buy yourself some time to flee yourself or reposition yourself better or get free of a bog monster  krakens grip probably the best use of a guardian charm. My  cents. Until I get a  lumenstone mastery Im not wasting my time with silly challenge builds. There are some build ideas that are worth trying because you wont know exactly how well they will work till you try them. But this is not one of those builds...there is no doubt that a guardian charm build even if used to the best possibility as tiny described is still a bad build...,brogueforum,dcmr201,3,t5_39htf
