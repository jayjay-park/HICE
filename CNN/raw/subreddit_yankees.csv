Whenever Beltrans elbow gets better we are back to  outfielders. Roberts is actually starting to hit but the Yankees need to find someone that can play B for the future. Id much rather see Wheeler getting time over Johnson. Johnson should just be a utility guy at this point. Solarte would have been a great option for B or B but he stopped hitting. Beltran was hitting until he tumbled over the wall in Tampa. Firing Cashman and Girardi doesnt make sense. You have  SP who are probably out for the season and DL stints for Tex Robertson Cervelli Beltran and Kelley. I dont know what you expect of them.  Ichiro shouldnt be leading off but he should be playing everyday. Gardner Jeter Ellsbury is fine for  in the lineup.We are only   games out of first.

The true beauty of the Stadium both older and new but more so older stadium is that just when you think youve heard the stadium as loud as it possibly can be you witness another crazy game that makes you swear you will never hear a louder stadium in your life. ,yankees,cnz14pv,3,t5_2qqfw

6085792,0,t3_3yugja,Coming from a fanbase that likely has a lot of Patriot fans in it this is somewhat hypocritical considering how fast they were to defend Aaron Hernandez. Do they allegations look bad? Absolutely. However I think its important to remember that at this point they are only allegations albeit severe allegations that look to be truthful and that Chapman is innocent until proven guilty.Does this all make me think less of Chapman as a person? I really dont know since I never really thought about him off the field all I ever really think about with him is a  MPH fastball. Its difficult as fans of sports sometimes to separate the athlete from the person. However if these allegations are true it is going to be hard for me to get past them whenever someone brings up his name. The best example of this for me is Mike Vick. I nearly gave up my Jets tickets when they signed him because I cannot ever get around what he did. Despite being one of the best players in the NFL for a few years I will only ever remember him for the dogfighting.,yankees,cyhbroe,1,t5_2qqfw

X  X   .M in additional regular season revenue. By  they were drawing  more fans per game than they were in . So round it off to an extra M per season in revenue by .Doesnt even factor in the massive TV ratings YES network that was helped immensely advertising jersey sales marketing dollars etc.I think if you added up all of the above youd see that ARod was a profitable venture.,yankees,d6f8126,3,t5_2qqfw
