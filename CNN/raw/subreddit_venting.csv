2147799,0,t1_cl3zgf5,Skip the huge confession. Play it off cool the next time she hangs out with your sister. Just walk up to her and chat her up. Keep an optimistic mindset and her signals should tell you where you stand. WIN or LOSE at least you can walk away without going through a super awkward love confession which would probably just scare her off anyhow unless she sectetly feels the same way too...,venting,clcu1e0,1,t5_2sdi7
2531915,0,t3_2omjca,Im guessing youre young. I would try new things go exploring try learning to skateboard try photography try lock picking... Try new things until youre old enough to move out and when that happens go have more fun buy a bike and ride it too fast. Buy a gun and practice with it.  Get new friends and party with them. There is so much to do and we tend to get into a rut get really bored then depressed. Keep life interesting!!,venting,cmp235g,2,t5_2sdi7
9742393,0,t3_5em7ch,Dont be freaked out. Stop thinking about it and just live. Stay aware and pay attention. Listen to yourself and dont ignore your feelings and instincts. Stay independent. The situation will come no doubt but how you   pay attention and handle the situation determines the outcome. Stay positive and believe in only the best for yourself. ,venting,dadyne9,2,t5_2sdi7

11035590,0,t1_deirko1,Okay. so like. It is kinda weird when I tell people in person about it. Like my moms old coworkers at publix or a professor at school. They have this look like they are expecting me to burst out in sadness. But like. I dont. I usually make awkward faces at their overly concerned faces. Whats happening to my mom sucks but there is literally nothing I can do about it. I can fix her. Make her brain Unbroke. So its like nothing to be sad about. Like Im sad. But its just the circle of life. Idk. Its just really weird when people give me concerned looks it makes me nervous. An when I get nervous I get a little hyper. But its nice talking online about it. I am just now really getting over hearing the cinching of her teeth and just watching her fall face first. Im literally just trying not to be the one who finds my mom dead. Thats my only goal in life right now haha.  ,venting,deiv4w1,1,t5_2sdi7
