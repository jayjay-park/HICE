616834,0,t3_217j7p,Cliff dont do it. Now to explain. Pick  mods and load them. Check the game to see if things are working right. If you crash repeatedly or see exclamation points all over remove  mod play again. If you still have problems remove the second mod and activate the first. Check again. If everything seems okay add  more mods rinse and repeat until all the mods you want to try !THAT SEEM TO BE WORKING! are in. Then start a for real game. If you just activate all the mods at once and something is screwing up you could spend hours trying to find the one mod that is bad. Doing it slowly is boring but will save you time in the long run.

2814965,0,t1_cno1f4h,The newest version of FOMM is ... just so you know.I used to use NMM but I found that it was far easier for me to use FOMM due to its comparatively hassle free design and easiertoaccess features.NMM is definitely useful dont get me wrong  its especially good for beginners and I still use it for  mods for Skyrim but I found that the features were harder to use again for me and that FOMM was more simplistic in a weird way. Also Im no expert but I heard a fair amount of talk about NMM being a bit screwy with mod installations sometimes never happened to me in a massive way but I have had issues with it before and I have certainly come across a few mods that dont support NMM installation. It is however definitely more actively updated and as such might be better in the long run but in my case I found it wasnt worth it.All in all if FOMM works fine for you I wouldnt recommend switching just because if something screws up then youre going to have to trawl through the Nexus again to find your mods and thats no good.

4086039,0,t3_37e08y,While I am still interested in the type of mod that I described Ive found a workaround.  Install the Wasteland Melee Mod Pack.  This distributes more melee weapons to NPCs apparently mostly to humans but not to all of them and barely any to super mutants based on my COC consolecommand teleport to The Mall..  Make sure to have the More ammo and x ammo for BoS and Enclave esps checked from NPCs Use Ammo..  Install the ancient More Ammo mod.  Its from  so it surely doesnt cover ammo types added by recent mods which is why you need to complete step .With all these mods enabled enemies fire weapons for a decently long time before switching to melee or unarmed and many humans have a melee weapon I only tested raiders at Springvale and SuperDuper Mart however.If you take down an enemy quickly youll get somewhere around  or  bullets.  I consider this realistic because of how many bullets the enemies obviously have in combat.You can wait until they fire all their bullets and then get an easier kill when theyre out of ammo but if you do this youll get no bullets.,FalloutMods,crm184w,2,t5_2s6oc

That doesnt happen.

There are very few ways NMM can fuck anything up that wouldnt also happen if you installed the mod using any other method and if MO creates orphaned files and fucks things up you can always do a fresh modreinstall.

6231416,0,t3_40whd3,gt I uninstalled the mod with NMM and even after loading the game saving quitting reloading adding a brand new copy of a given weapon with console commands the names are stuck on your version. It was bad enough when random weapons wouldnt have the changes applied when the mod was installed. Now without a trace of it left on my hard drive those names that did get changed are stuck like that.gtI even tried changing weapon mods at the workbench which was the only way for preexisting guns to get their names changed which only worked sometimes anyway go figure and the names wont change back.gtAlso I couldnt get the ammo name changes to apply at all when it was installed.gtI regret ever knowing this mod exists.gtposted    Jan  edited at   Jan by dodspringerIts unsurprising he was a dick to you considering the way you went at him in your original post. Mod authors are only human after all. It sounds like the mod is still running on your system already renamed items would keep their existing names that is normal but newly dropped items ammo and grenades should not.

Did you adjust your load order a lot did you remove a lot of mods and add a bunch while saving with the mods in? What happens if a mod replaces a rigged quested skeleton and the nif that was build in with a newly rigged flamingo? Are there any world edits? etc etc. No way to test a console mod in FOEdit for potential errors or dirty edits whose to say what the thief did before uploading it?

Your best bet will be a new save with everything updated. HOWEVER if you havent given up yet there might be a way. Someone was nice enough to post a link where you can rollback your version of Fallout  to a previous version. I just did this rollback a few days ago in order to keep using the script extender while they updated it for the new patch. Reupdated everything correctly by doing verify game cache on steam once the script extender was up to date. Heres the link At the bottom you can see the downgrade section. Just apply them one after the other to get back to the version you have everything configured for. Important to note to keep steam in offline mode otherwise it might just auto update you again. Shame they make it this difficult to rollback and what not but Im sure it saves Bethesda a ton in support by not allowing you easysupported access to previous versions.Good luck and if you have any questions just ask.

The easier it looks like it can be taken apart the better but I think you could definitely have advanced MKII modules that make them appear to be specially made instead of mass produced.Moving on this is a matter usually fixed by textures but I hope youll be careful about the copperish tubing.

8370511,0,t3_4u6nwf,I honestly think that it has less to do with modding across all Bethesda games and has more to do with the fact that people just dont like Fallout  as much as Skyrim.  I have a friend who mods and just doesnt seem interested in making any Fallout  mods.  In general I think that probably Skyrim is a much better canvas for mod authors because its so bland sorry guys and theres a lot more to do in a generic fantasy setting than there is to do in Fallout which has a specific time a specific theme art style narrative and even voice actor for the player character.  But in general I think people dont like Fallout  as much as Skyrim or even previous Betheseda Fallout games so less people are interested in playing it or making mods for it.

8451176,0,t1_d5xxf0m,Yep! Thats the problem with ENBs. A lot are so good for different reasons. For Skyrim recently I had Seasons of Skyrim ENB which has the most beautiful sunsets of any ENB Ive used. The golden wave on the horizon was perf. But then I found TAZ Visual Overhaul that practically makes my game look like Dragon Age Inquisition. I prefer TAZ overall but man do I miss the SoS sunsets. If only I could combine the two.But anyway I had the same want for ENBs. I want it to be super gorgeous but not stray too far from the actual look. I love those ENBs too but theyre just not my preference. Edit I would have suggested Dynamo as well but someone else already had. I havent personally used it but I did consider it originall after looking at the screens and a video or two. If Im not mistaken its a bit darker while Envada is a brighter and got some slight washing out.Id probably use Dynamo for FO and Nevada for FNV since vanilla FO was already a more dreary game than vanilla NV.,FalloutMods,d5xxm5r,1,t5_2s6oc

8543379,0,t3_4ws4g4,I like a modern military look for my PC. There are a lot of mods that can go into thisClothes Wasteland Grunts  Tactical Operator overwrite  gives you one camo and two plain uniforms. I prefer them because the sleeves are rolled up to just below the elbow. If you dont like those the search results for fatigue on the Nexus should have what you need.Armor Modern Firearms if you want the guns too C.U.T.E. if just want the body armor. Custom Combat Armor allows you to put carbon fiber and a number of camo textures on the combat armor along with other customizations.Accessories Cross Uni Headset  radio headsets Cross Uni Scarf  customizable scarf Armorsmith Extended  probably get gloves from here also a number of holstered weapons available Tactical Flashlights or West Tek Tactical Optics The Scouter is another viable headgear option. Survivalist GoBags  adds some great backpacks with accessories and weapons. Alternately Wearable Camo Backpacks is a fine choice too. Military Caps Extended gives lots more options if you go the beret route Classic Army Helmets gives you the most options once youre in game. If you dont like that one Id just search army helmet on Nexus to find a reskin that you do like  something like Helmets of the Wasteland Theres also Cross Ballistic Masks and Cross Institute Masks if you want to do that.You can see two examples in this settlement album There is a close up of a mannequin using this gear and a shot of the PC and Cait at the end  the PC is wearing this kind of gear.As far as specific camo patterns go just search that on Nexus.

9113392,0,t1_d877xoa,gt Spending all that time building up a settlement to get things that you could easily have gotten from just playing the game normally like bottle caps and adhesive just feels like a waste of time.Adhesive isnt all that easy to come by though. As the sheer numbers of complaints about where to find it right after launch attest. It was an extremely common complaint of where can I get adhesive so I can upgrade my weapon?!. Something like Northland Diggers may be up your ally but it doesnt change the functionality as you are terming it. The purpose of build stuff to attract settlers so you can assign them to things to gather materials doesnt change. There has been some talk of modding the happiness system into a more Sims like experience but as far as I know there hasnt been any actual headway made there. And even then taking it and turning it more towards another game wouldnt make it any less waste of time so I dont really know what it is you are after. ,FalloutMods,d87a6jo,1,t5_2s6oc

9495069,0,t3_5as4yq,I think that a variety of weapons would have tremendously benefited from a deep ammunition system.For example weapons could have a property called tollerance which is how well they handle garbage ammunition. A revolver has  tolerance because even if theres a dud you just go to the next round while something like a gauss rifle would have low tolerance its designed for a specific highquality ammunition.Thus if you have a bunch of rusty gauss ammo using the homemade gauss rifle makes sense because while it has weaker range damage and accuracy it wont jam up every other shot from garbage ammo. Pristine prewar ammo is extremely valuable.Why would you want a two shot shotgun instead of combat shotgun? Because the twoshot has  tollerance. Why would you want a pipe rifle instead of a combat rifle? Because the pipe rifle handles bad ammo better than the combat rifle.,FalloutMods,d9jgxmf,2,t5_2s6oc

But Place Anywhere has the ability to turn on Select Anything using the insert key. By pressing this you can then select truly anything and scrap it. Its convenient to be able to turn the feature off at will. But it requires  mods and FSE. I just cant tell you how many times I accidently scrapped the whole of Red Rocket and had to reload a save.

If you arent sure if you have more than one mod that affects any given thing then load everything and check. .esm and .esp files are both plugins the only difference is that .esm files are flagged as masters for other plugins. Theres a hard cap of  plugins including base gameDLC so that leaves  for mods. Assuming you have all the DLC youve still got room for another  plugins so youre good there. Im personally clueless there. Ive never used the check for errors function. Number of Records you dropped the s is exactly what it sounds like  a total of how many records things like Game Setting variables item IDs keywords etc etc  the shit that makes the game work basically each plugin has e.g the Nuka World .esm has  records and Fallout .esm has .

I think Goodsprings Shack adds a new small player home in goodsprings so it would likely be fine to remove. You generally dont want to remove any mod that modifies a large portion of the base game as thats when you get the errors.Adding a mod at any point in a save is fine as far as I know.

Reorganises weapons and adds custom workbenches for new craftables most mods have options to craft them here as well.Settlement Keywords Expanded and Homemaker for settlements. Competely reworks settlement menus adds framework for other mods like Northland OCD Better Stores etc.Def Hud Hud Framework and the sorting mod of your choice for inventory  UI stuff. Valdacils Item Sorting has the most compatibility IMO. Hud overhauls sorting overhauls and framework for configuration and widgets.Most people will say enboost and shadowboost are crucial too since they help performance so much.,FalloutMods,ddxt7z9,0,t5_2s6oc

Youll still get the hint from Mama Murphy and you wont have to deal with him or the settlement quests.As for bringing back skill checks thats a ways off. The code for that literally does not exist in the game IIRC so any mod author that takes on that challenge is basically starting from scratch. I know of one guy that frequents this sub who is at least planning on trying to do it but odds are something that massive is a few months off at best.As for an altstart mod theres Start Me Up over on the Nexus and IIRC theres one or two others.,FalloutMods,de002ft,9,t5_2s6oc

10927320,0,t3_5w3wi8,Shoeburglar who made the Plasma Cycler and the Makeshift AntiMaterial Rifle has released the China LakeHolorifle. Id been following the updates for a little while now and was pretty hyped for it.Theyre two separate weapons but function similarly in terms of firing speedreload. The Holorifle can be a little difficult to use but then again so was FNVs holorifle. The China Lake has a few nice weapon part options but the real meat lies in its receivers. You can switch it to fire  different types of mm ammo. Nothing can beat a mm shotgun shell.My only gripes with the mod as of right now is it adds  unique ammo items to the game which isnt a huge deal and you cant switch the recievers to fire different ammo on the fly like you can with Seans M Grenade LauncherExplosives So youre stuck with whatever you make it at the workbench hopefully that could be an option later on though.,FalloutMods,de72rj0,1,t5_2s6oc

10944275,0,t1_de7wjag,gtI hate to say this but mod authors should upload their mods both to the nexus and Bethesda mod page.Very easy for you to say my friend. For a modder that only has a pc to play Fallout  with and wants to bring his mod to the consoles? Not do much. Think about it figuring or if their mod is compatible jumping through the hoops Microsoft Bethesda and Sony set up. The actual act of converting the mod which could take many hours depending on the changes that need to be made the continual need to check for bugs despite not even owning the goddamn system theyre modding for. And once its released thats two more file pages they need to police themselves to check for bug reports and spam in the comments. Its not as easy as going into the G.E.C.K. and clicking the button that says Make mod  consloe plz xoxo.
