Spacing is still a bit of an issue.Wording All indicated wording errors have been corrected. But looking over the scoring guidelines  was probably too high beforehand so Ill just leave it there now. Creativity .No change.BalanceMechanics Most of my suggestions have been implemented as well as some others that I approve of good job reworking Resilience. Score increased.,boh5e,cxusy7s,1,t5_39s31
6139402,0,t3_3zklkk,A slew of minor changes have been made now based on critic feedback.Critic changes Colour changes across the board to better reflect phb used the phb itself as reference reworded Hide in Plain Sight text reworded Foe Slayer text Slew of cosmetic changes to beastmaster reworded bits and pieces of Rangers Companion text to better fit with phb Added subsubtitles to help break up the wall of text and improve readability General grammer changesFull list of changes made to base classGeneral All fixes seen in the Players Handbook Errata have been applied Spells Known progression changes to equal Eldritch KnightArcane Trickster progression Lv Primal Awareness can now be used a number of times equal to   Wis modifier minimum . Each use last for one minute. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. The Vanish Feature has been moved from level  to level  far too weak for such a late game ability Lv Hide in Plain Sight feature now requires you to camouflage again only when you take damage instead of when you move take an action or reaction. Also creatures that have spotted you while camouflaged have advantage on Wisdom Perception checks against you until you camouflage again. Foe Slayer renamed Exploit Weakness and moved changed from lvl  ability to lvl . New lvl  ability Foe Slayer. On your turn when you hit a favored enemy with an attack you can channel primal energy to turn it into a deadly blow. The attack deals an additional d damage and the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. If it fails and the creature has  hit points or fewer after being hit then it dies immediately. If the enemy is not a favored enemy this damage is halved and they only die if they are below hp. You can use this feature once per long rest on each of your favored enemies and one normal enemy. Ranger now gains an additional Favored Enemy at th lvl and an additional Favored Terrain at lvl Hunter Archetype lvl  Defensive tactics Steel Will changed to offer immunity to the frightened condition rather than just advantage against it. lvl  Mulitattack Whirlwind Strike changed You can use your action to move half your remaining speed and make an attack against any number of creatures that came within  feet of you during this movement. You must use a separate attack roll for each target and this movement can provoke opportunity attacks.Beastmaster Archetype Pretty much a complete overhaul of the companion system.

10381558,0,t3_5mfs2g,ucalculuschildOverall Score .WritingFormatting .No issues. Impressive to manage to condense all important information into a mere two pages especially considering the sheer volume of recipes. The symbol use greatly improves the efficiency of the word economy. Wish I could use these symbols for my Mad Scientist class. Could you send them to me? I need ones for Fire Lightning and Cold.Noxious Smokestick Spelling error in nd sentence. food cube area.Smokestick Grammatical error in last sentence add s to the end of  round.Zaebelles Torpor rd sentence should say and wakes up if it takes damage rather than unless the the sleeper takes damage.Creativity The use of symbols and the names for ingredients are just lovely. MechanicsBalance .Follows along the progression of ushylockVs Poisoners Kit.Interesting points of departure  Uses d for Common Ingredients instead of d Grants a  out of  chance of acquiring a special ingredient instead of a  out of   Specific ingredients dont matter. Rather it is their essence that eventually dictates the resultant effects. Time to make an alchemical recipe is  hours for every  gp worth of the recipe as opposed to poisoners kits  hour. Uses unconventional DC calculation for determining difficulty of succeeding on alchemy crafting.Unlike the poison effects from the Poisoners Kit the general alchemical effects all have comparative less significant effects and require more ingredients. With the focus on essences it is functional that the probabilities of acquiring any specific ingredient is flatter i.e. much less of a bell curve.Rather than adding a special effect all Special Ingredients do is make crafting more efficient hence the allowance that they come up more often than poison special ingredients.An unaddressed matter is whether Alchemy crafting is considered light activity or not. If it isnt then nobody can craft during long rests. If it is then only the races that trance or similar can. Is it the intention that alchemy crafting must be done outside of long rests especially considering the x plus greater crafting time required?The unconventional DC calculation results in a minimum DC  and a maximum DC  so no alchemical formula is beyond a Hard DC. This is in contrast with poisons whose DCs can potentially go as high DC  Wild Sageroot  Bloodleaf  Spineflower  Emetic Wax assuming you dont just use  Spineflowers. While I agree with a low minimum DC for alchemy due to their reduced potency compared to poisons it is unfortunate that this mechanical design puts a strict limit on the maximum DC at . This is a result of using total number of ingredients to determine the DC rather than the specific ingredients in use. Regarding Custom Alchemical Bombs I am confused. It saysgtAny creature within  feet of that point must make a DC  Dexterity saving throw or suffer the effects of the bomb.Then under General Alchemical Effects it lists several effects with their own area of effects and DCs.If a creature is within  ft of a point where I threw a shrapnel bomb does that creature make two Dexterity saving throws one against a DC  and another against a DC ?Regarding the gel general alchemical effect does this mean that if I happen to have a shrapnellightninggel bomb it will deal  piercing damage and  lightning damage on that creature every round until it gets rid of it? Is it at the start or end of that creatures turn? Probably end to give it a chance to wipe it off first. Why only Dex check and not Str as well? Flinging it off with force as well as with agility.Regarding the Mist general alchemical effect what is its benefit? In what scenario does lightly obscuring an area help?Alchemical RecipesAlchemists Fire With the crafting time set at  hours per every  gp of value this will take  hours to craft. This is unfortunate due to the compared efficiency of simply gaining access to the Firebolt or Produce Flame cantrip or merely lighting and wielding a torch.I am coming to believe that the time scale for this Alchemy was based on the PHB crafting rule of  gp per day of any finished product. If not for the release of the UA Forge Cleric I would have likely agreed altering downtime crafting to  gp of progress as a reasonable update to the PHB system.The Forge Cleric completely upended my understanding of reasonable expectations on crafting time. Assuming two short rests within a day a Forge Cleric can craft up to  gp worth of finished metal product at second level. Even considering that UA tends to be on the toopowerful end simply halving this amount still nets us a  gp per day crafting rate compared to the PHBs  gp limit and your  gp limit.I recommend using the Forge Cleric as a basis. Perhaps every  hour nets  gp towards a finished product thus reducing the time to make Alchemists Fire from  hours to . Alternatively every two hours   gp of progress less intuitive but should get us that Alchemists Fire in  hours instead of .One concerning thing is how this necessarily puts gold values on each object thus also determining sale values. It costs nothing to gather ingredients and only costs ingredients to craft and so a PC could make an extremely lucrative business on simple crafting even with the  hour for every  gp limit. This is in contrast with the poisons wherein there are no gold values attached to anything.Breath Bottle Considering that PCs can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to their Con Mod minimum  seconds this seems like a far too conservative number. I would allow it up as high as  minutes. Or every breath taken from the bottle grants the inhaler  minute of operation without needing to breath with there being  breaths total available.Gashglue Iiiinteresting. Instant Rope Do you have to burst the bladder? Can you instead just pour out however much you want?Noxious Smokestick This has got to be one of the most powerful recipes here far better than ALchemists Fire. Heavy obscuring Incapacitation for  rounds and a naturally high DC? With a crafting DC maximum of  minimum ?Snappowder Wouldnt Perception be more appropriate to detect it? Investigation would be for determining what it isdoes not for noticing it.OverviewThough there are some significant mechanical issues that need to be addressed the creator has done a remarkable job of executing the project to expand the use of Alchemists Supplies. Utilizing symbols and names to great effect the creator has created an accessible document for aspiring alchemists. The overall score is high but the mechanical issues should not remain ignored. ,boh5e,dcktb4h,5,t5_39s31
