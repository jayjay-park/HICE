4276,0,t1_ceeqs6i,Far more reasons than one really. The shortest most important answer is that there is a shared radio tower for most stations in the reallife Los Angeles at this location Mt. Lee is its real name utilized via relay. The reason for this is the presence of mountains and hollows that can interfere with the effectiveness of radio towers in the valley. All it takes is a knowledge of Los Angeles  and additionally process of elimination! ,chiliadmystery,ceexa70,0,t5_2yljs

45707,0,t1_cejmlfw,Alright but I am a bit unclear as to what your point is with the Frozen Alien. We seem to agree that it confirms the existence of aliens in the game. But if you thought that I meant that there are more hidden aliens to be found then I wasnt clear. Im just basically going as far as you are that it confirms that aliens are in the games universe. The fact that it is an alien also confirms that it had to travel in space to North Yankton somehow therefore I move on to the flying saucers.Just thought Id clear that up.Edit I also realized the point that you made with hints as a choice of word.

64116,0,t3_1uu3ug,gtso its fair to say that pretty much any theory regardless of how crazy it may sound should not be dismissedCan you give me a theory to work with? Im not sure what this theory is even supposed to be. I tried reading MWs theory before he deleted it and the best I can make out this is what it boils down togtAqcuire a Perfect Waning Crescent moon.  Or possibly the day before  to allow for preperataion being ready to pick up Ursula from the marina in Sandy Shores.So wait until the moon is at that point in its cycle or just before that point. I havent got an explanation as to why Im assuming the glyph.gtBang UrsulaInitiate Ursulas thunderstorm trigger so it is both later in game than an undefined point in time other than a perfect crescent moon or possibly the day before and also thunderstormingraining.gtHeres where you come into play Go to different important locations after steps  and  above.. Mt. Josiah Mt. Gordo anyone? Different times. Different Weather. Different moon phase. This is really confusing what locations are important? Where abouts on the mountains? They are big areas. And why are we following the  steps above at a nearly specific time or moonphase and weather and then wandering off to anywhere else at any other time in any other weather? It appears the importance of this step is solely to do random stuff after having banged ursula on or just before a crescent moon.gtPotential final step ride the tram up  without skipping the scene. You now have a theory to test directly in game  all day every day think of the combinations to test.When am I supposed to take this ride? What am I supposed to have done first? Im assuming this is the mount chiliad cable car being referred to? It seems like Im being asked to ride a tram after the above steps but the above steps are so loosely defined that I could fulfil this part by just going on the tram ride any time after I have banged ursula on or just before? a crescent moon.I might make another post and quote the whole deleted theory so as to be clear. I have no faith that there is actually a workable testable theory to come out of MWs postings though.,chiliadmystery,celq9n6,1,t5_2yljs

It could be really really easy to solve if you think about it and have never looked at the theories online. Its possible we dismissed the true solution because it wasnt elaborate enough. Something HAS to be in the game and there HAS to be more. I have online and if there WAS nothing more to it or it wasnt in the game theyd have changed the mural. It isnt hard to change a texture they could have either put a blank stone texture on to get rid of it or put something like theyre here or something to symbolise how the UFOs are the end of the journey. Its so easy to change a texture that it must be there for a reason still. They get enough people from here and GTA forums bitching that they dont get it and must have help so its not like Rockstar dont know its there because one Developer slapped it on the end just to mindfuck us.SOMETHING else IS in the game. Something. Its possible that with all these new kids coming on here with  completion going what if you guys try X? weve effectively been clusterfucked into a corner by shitty ideas. Not to be a dick but I dont try things that seem stupid. Cargobob the Space Docker to the UFO. Thats stupid enough anyway but its not a real SD. its a dune buggy and for all that it clearly has two wings that fold out theyre clearly two trash cans stuck to little metal wings and holding right while stationary doesnt lower said wings like the roof of a convertible. I dont think its SD related but Im not about to start cargobobbing my only one to Max altitude to feed the alien ship because some eleven year old who doesnt have a console or gta suggested the aliens are hungry.There must be something. Something awesome. A cool trail for people to follow. Not the mindfuck express down a wild goose chase weve made it. I dont think youll need internet just a blank mind as you think about the mural. Think of all the crappy suggestions on this sub and the forums. We dont need that on our mind. The end is here and we cant see because of the terrible long winded theories.

359945,0,t1_cfhmzwh,Yup Was merely looking for a way to show the transparency of hud. Was just a nice screenshot i found online to put in as the background. The main reason we believed it to be a HUD was that the animation file itself is x. Which means it was intended to cover the entire screen as well as appearing to leave a perfect area in the bottom left corner for the minimap to appear.Unfortunately as of yet noone has been able to find any other related content to this animation or where if anywhere it gets executed in code.... ,chiliadmystery,cfi2ot0,1,t5_2yljs

362663,1,t3_1y8fmk,Thanks T! Karma. What a chameleon. Everyone has been seeing me over the last several months loving and sharing hunting in and out of game  truthseeking with some incredible minds amp wonderful people. Its with this patience and focus that I was brought to the Karma theory. Not to sound megalomaniacal but a lot of you guys amp gals know me and my benevolent nature and the amount of dedication to the hunt. Ive been advocating this approach since before I knew it. Im also an artsy type so I can often read metaphor easier than a numbers person and vice versa. We all need each other to crack this the right way. Just like R needed each other to make this game. To quote Dan Housers acceptance speech at the dice awards. gtR is a family. An occasionally dysfunctional family made up of people who at least in my case would be entirely useless on their own but when were together we can create magic. From megalomaniac designers paranoid artists vain animators passiveaggressive engineers neurotic producers  vicious sound guys rd rate writers  we all belong and have found a home together. Through our collective belief in the power amp potential of the medium we have been able to make and release some very special games. This is us too. Were a dedicated group of people who have come together to share via this medium of the Internet. I may be the crazy guy who hears things and sees things in sound but because of this hunt and our mutual love we have all come together and some of us have been able to look past the crazy thoughts every single one of us had at one point. Like Dan said Magic happens when a group of people can get together and look past the shield of crazy that a lot of us put up. Hell. My reddit name was a joke until I realized its potential to raise awareness to fact check  no matter how crazy it sounds. Some of you may have been disappointed that Ive gone Full Brian and I can understand why. I thank you all for that fear as that means Ive gained some respect with the  people of this sub. Trust me I am not a different person. Ill still be discussing and analyzing this thing with everyone because I love you all. Ive discussed the karma theory and found very sound reasoning in the game through thematic elements that Karma is there. Invisibly so. Best example Shortly after my fellow Canadian Trevor puts the boots to the back of Johnnys skull then goes and kills a bunch of lost and destroys some property. A while later T returns home and hears from Ron that the lost had come to his trailer and destroyed the inside of it. Trevor enters and sees the trailer a mess but is only truly upset when his impotent rage toy was broken. He claims it was one of the most important things to him. The lost did to Trevor what Trevor did to the lost. He killed their idol. Theres more Ive noticed and Im more than happy to discuss them if people are curious but the best idea is to check it out yourself. I cannot believe something until Ive seen it myself. Anyway in short. I advocate freespeech and the repealing of rule . If you feel the same I suggest you do it to. With much love Brother Matthew Tinfoil,chiliadmystery,cficthn,2,t5_2yljs

365399,0,t1_cfilwsv,Yeah pretty much. Things definitely got weirder than Id expected. Lots of egg hunting communities get distilled down to a certain kind of player but its usually role players in my experience. For a long time people looked for new things in Marathon but it never got so.. culty. I looked for Marathon references in Halo games for years and ways of connecting them. Lots of people did. But we knew things were there that there was a bigger story. They were fun games to hunt in. Finding some greater metaphysical meaning in GTAV though thats just.... In any case I think once DLC comes out things will pick up in earnest again as itll bring a lot of people back out of the woodwork.,chiliadmystery,cfin0bi,1,t5_2yljs

699410,0,t3_224rlz,There isnt a jetpack in the game I think thats clear. There are no models no animations no textures no sounds no dialogue no mission scripts NOTHING on the game disc to indicate it exists.The belief that these are somehow hidden on the gamedisc because Rockstar knew we would look for it is quite frankly idiotic.  If they went to the trouble of hiding one part of the mystery why not hide the UFO models textures etc? Why not hide the mission scripts used in the DLC? Why not hide everything?The only suggestion that there might be a jetpack in the game is that theres a picture of one on the mural and something else on the mural IS in the game the UFO.However this theory that the three items in the symbols MUST appear in the game falls down when you also consider that there isnt a cracked egg in the game either.  Yes there is a weird looking egg model one that actually ISNT cracked but just because its on the disc doesnt mean its in the game after all we all remember Hot Coffee dont we?.So you must then consider that IF the symbols at the bottom DONT represent items in the game what DO they represent?,chiliadmystery,cgjrxbo,6,t5_2yljs

For instance in  Werner Heisenberg stated that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined the less precisely its momentum can be known and vice versa.  The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position x and the standard deviation of momentum p was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard  later that year and by Hermann Weyl  in gtgtImage iInteresting Fourier transform | Uncertainty Principle Numbers | The Uncertainty Principle film | The Uncertainty Principle Doctor Who audio Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgqxey oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgqxey.

1060970,0,t1_chosrsq,It staying stationary once the lighthouse is off screen sounds less like a feature and more like basic game culling.If set up correctly most games incorporate a system whereby anything off screen or not in the players direct line of sight is not rendered by the game engine.The reason a map this size and this detailed can run on the PS and Xbox  hardware is due to this. Anything behind a building in front of you or off screen is basically turned off. The models arent spawned and the textured not loaded.This is why you see whats known as commonly known popin when moving really fast. Its where somehow youve managed to get to an area where something hasnt been rendered because it thought you couldnt see it realizes you can see it and catches up.Basically the lighthouse is being removed from existence when it goes off camera. The dynamic light entity is likely parented to something rotating within the lighthouse to manipulate the light direction. When the lighthouse disappears the light stops moving. Move a little further and the cone disappears too even if you could see the lights effects such as reflections of light on rocks. If the light source goes far enough off camera itll disappear and so will its impact on the world. Even if youre looking right where that reflection was when it happens.,chiliadmystery,chovxf3,3,t5_2yljs

I enjoy reading what other people can come up with some of these people have brought up some really interesting stuff. For the most part I like the community that has been formed around this hunt. There are heroes and villains and my life is more interesting to me after having found this place.When someone comes here and makes a comment like you did even using the impossibletonotsoundsmug phrase I told you so all theyre really saying is that they dont understand the apeall of playing the game the way we are or theyve grown tired of it and think everyone else should too. Thats fine that you feel the way you do but its not productive in this subreddit and Id personally feel bad for trying to ruin some peoples good times under a misguided sense that Im actually helping.

1683816,0,t3_2dm5fs, Now this seems to go with the cracked egg on mural and the altruist cam drawing. the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches Easter eggs are dyed red to represent the blood of Christ shed on the Cross and the hard shell of the egg symbolized the sealed Tomb of Christ  the cracking of which symbolized his resurrection from the dead. Easter eggs are blessed by the priest at the end of the Paschal Vigil which is equivalent to Holy Saturday and distributed to the faithful. The egg is seen by followers of Christianity as a symbol of resurrection while being dormant it contains a new life sealed within it. Air emu is also a mailing service with this quote Take our birds anywhere you like. Oh and emus cant fly.  Some eggs like emu or ostrich eggs are so large and strong that the shells may be carved without breaking. Decorations on emu eggs take advantage of the contrast in colours between the dark green mottled outside of the shell and the shellunderlay. The oldest eggshells decorated with engraved hatched patterns are dated for   years ago and were found at Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.,chiliadmystery,cjrep3c,1,t5_2yljs

You need to follow the function calls through the code which can be a bit of a bitch because it requires you to jump back and forth through the text. All functions on that page ufo.txt do appear to be called following the spawning of the ufo at am in the rain. Dont let the giant list of cases fool you the vast majority of it isnt actually being called by the ufo related functions. What is likely being called are case  and case  which refer to ufo and ufoeye respectively both of which have coordinates that match the location where the chiliad ufo spawns. Im no expert so I may be wrong but follow the function calls and you will see that they are all related to the chiliad ufo somehow and replay stuff is likely not going to be related to the UFO seeing as though the UFO has no impact on replaying missions.,chiliadmystery,ck7u1p9,3,t5_2yljs

1960560,0,t1_ckpg6dq,ampampamp Trinity sfw gtgtThe Christian doctrine of the Trinity from Latin trinitas triad from trinus threefold  defines God as three consubstantial persons  expressions or hypostases  the Father the Son Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit one God in three persons. The three persons are distinct yet are one substance essence or nature.  In this context a nature is what one is while a person is who one is.   gtAccording to this central mystery of most Christian faiths  there is only one God in three persons while distinct from one another in their relations of origin as the Fourth Lateran Council declared it is the Father who generates the Son who is begotten and the Holy Spirit who proceeds and in their relations with one another they are stated to be one in all else coequal coeternal and consubstantial and each is God whole and entire.  Accordingly the whole work of creation and grace is seen as a single operation common to all three divine persons in which each shows forth what is proper to him in the Trinity so that all things are from the Father through the Son and in the Holy Spirit. gtMany concepts seen as essential elements of the Christian faith such as monotheism incarnation omnipotence are denoted by terms not found in the Bible although Christians consider the concepts to be contained in the Bible. The term Bible itself which is not found in the Bible is an example. The term Trinity is another such term. gtgtImage i  The Shield of the Trinity or Scutum Fidei diagram of traditional Western Christian symbolism.Interesting TRINITY | Trinity College Cambridge | Trinity College Dublin | Trinity College Connecticut Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwckpgtz oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteckpgtz.

2471525,0,t1_cmgy0pv,my link was nearest to those coords that are in game You think its the phillipines over positions much closer to the REAL LIFE version of Sandy Shores in game I dont know what to tell you Also the Jubilee Trail Happy Trail and small lake identical to the one near Gordo again You can think to yourself it is the Phillipines but Im going to go ahead and say you are wrong.  Those coords are very   close to the in game coords use your brain.  Salton Sea and Joshua Tree State Park are Real locations that are in game and the Jubilee Trail I imagine in BOVINGTON is probably a trail the makers of the game most notably the LEAD DEV uses in real life as a bike trail.  But please convince yourself the coords are random locations in the phillipines......    . N and   . W  IS EXTREMELY CLOSE TO  N and ? W  As are the other coords in the other link. We are talking a deviation of minutes not across the globe.   Those are the locations you get when you put the IN GAME COORDS INTO A COORDINATE MAP.  NOT JUST A GUESS I didnt randomly go to real life locations and then work backwards from that that would be stupid again use your brain.  What is more likely?  Random location that makes no sense.... or locations that ARE IN GAME.  If you want to argue its the Philippines then explain what they mean.

2915477,0,t1_cnz4xbc,gtThat is patently onesided. I understand you want your sub to have a future but you need to moderate fairly.Ive told you before I dont consider a longterm future for this sub when I discuss the possibilities of an answer to the mysterys legitimacy. As long as there is a definitive answer as to whether there is or is no mystery to be solved Im happy. Thats what were here for no more no less.I worked with you to the best of my abilities. I went further than the some of the other mods were willing to go and retyped your question as a support ticket to Rockstar Support and received a contraryconflicting answer to yours. Something that even your ticket was supposedly then later corrected anyway by another employee stepping in.Therefore I dont see any gain from using your private accounts or pursuing things any further. Weve received confirmation both privately and publicly that what you were told in that ticket was not completely accurate and thats all we really needed to know.If this has literally become a fight for your submission to be made public then so be it. Ill publish it for the sake of your honor and piece of mind. But to keep acting like there is some agendaconspiracy or that were not trying to to trust and work with you in the mod mail is very frustrating. Especially considering that before this fiasco I had never used Rockstars confusing Support system and had to find it through a myriad of pages after logging into an old account I hadnt used in over a year just to help confirm your claim.Its not easy to moderate and be liked at the same time and its very difficult sometimes to sort trolls from not given the amount of people that come and go especially considering your reply was obviously from a Rockstar employee not doing their job correctly if a real screenshot.Bottom line your submission is public again.

3801426,0,t3_33xxg4,The skin changer randomizes possible combinations when selecting characters as each character has multiple bodygroups. Similar to how the trainer in GTAIV would sometimes give you characters with hats but then without hats if you chose them again.In GTAV its slightly glitchy. Whether thats the trainers fault or due to the way models are loaded in GTAV is yet to be seen but the eye thing isnt intentional.It happens with multiple models for example some white characters will show up with black arms.The eyes youre seeing here as with Devin Weston as some have mentioned seem to be using one of the other texture files that are used to complete a texture.For example one texture not only has the main colored texture but also contains things like a height mapbump mapexponentalphaetc which when combined together create a texture that has height depth and reacts to light and ingame shaders in appropriate ways.In this case her eyes are not loading properly or the model is unfinished and are showing one of these textures.,chiliadmystery,cqplcfx,1,t5_2yljs

I think the sixth wanted level is used in game though just not how you would traditionally think. certain situations and missions such as the prologue where you have a wanted level but the game has more control over where and when police will spawn as oppose to having it play out with the standard police ai and it be the same as any other police chase you would have in free roam.

The blue lines are added after the fact and should not stop you from proceeding with your pattern.gtbut it still seems far too symmetrical for a lighting bugLighting bugs often show up polygons.  If the polygons are symmetrical as these are then the lighting bug will be symmetrical.gtThis game can do lighting on dynamic deformable objects but cant handle a static curve with preset lighting?I have seen situations like this in my D design class and that was only a few months long and I was already encountering this kind of thing.  Its very common and thats why anyone who has worked with D and seen this issue before is immediately agreeing whereas its taking time for the others to see it.  D lighting can be very VERY finnickey.

I made a post here about the shadows at observatory looking like the eye glyphs and possibly telling us an eclipse. So if those observatory shadow dials are just that then the hippy camp would need shadows from things to point out things in the puzzle.

SOL OM and ON are also  different ways to describe the light or source from where its emits. Its  different languages  Heliopolis aka On was the ancient city in Egypt representing the light.

4839673,0,t1_cu4k50a,These wallpapers are symbolic of the worship of sun and moon as Christ. The hand gesture is using the same gesture Jesus did in many paintings in the past. This is to show you that the moon is a deity in the mystery schools. The poster this OP is talking about was not accurate in what he was saying whatsoever. All of these wallpapers are symbolic of mystery school teachings. The star above the pyramid represents the star Sirius the blazing star of Freemasonry. The lightning in the moons hands represents its powerful nature as a god. The stepped pyramid represents the  stepped pyramid and is indicative of The Great Plan  the new order of the ages aka new world order. These hand signs usually represent the Holy Trinity. However it is quite the opposite here. Representing Christ as a moon atop Sirius and a pyramid tells you all you need to know. It is not about the Holy Trinity whatsoever.

4940224,0,t1_cugwv97,What is a X on a map ? A mark. The people who make this mark knows what it refers to. The people who read the map and discover the mark cant know what it refers to. This is the meaning of Xs. This mural explains a movement as life is universal or life is just one long mystery. From the eye our eye or observation we go we act and make decisions. And because our eye lies or capture unknown markings it goes through our spirit and finally get out as theories or beliefs choices communities etc. As soon as two people throw their eye onto a same land or object or idea they segregate themselves and rearrange the world as they think It should be rearranged. X marks the spot. This is all we need to know. The spot itself doesnt matter we have to understand signs as signs not as disguised references because this is exactly the universal mistake that this mural and the whole game explains and mock about human societies.  from my cave I see thunder and Im afraid of get out  I try to understand this kind of unknown sign  I call it god  I teach to my caves brother what I saw but instead of telling I saw something i cant explain I say there is a god outside follow my steps if you dont want to die  we go out and draw things about god and we make it as a thunder bolt shape  we do it everywhere we can  we meet another group far away from our cave they call it science or they call it god but their own conceptions are different than ours gt this means war. After all this no one can see a thunder bolt anymore but needs to know why this drawing had to exist... Etc. X is a shape possibly refering to anything it is a nonsense shape. It is there to be understood by the people who draw them only it contains no message. At best as the lines end up on those boxes or right after these are the idea of trying explore notice try again and mark. A Japanese song I love is call led Go mad and mark and talk about the way we see old times vestiges without being able to know what they were made for and about our natural need to write something down about how we interpret them and to make our own projections a kind of unmovable truth. Which goes with wars laws seals creation of states.. The one R mock is one nation under god and we should keep thinking about this. The moutain shape is something closed in which the eye penetrates through a little empty box... Anyway Im sure in lost you minutes ago !

The San Jacinto Mountains are just East of Los Angeles in the desert. Some people that arent from California dont realize this but this new version of San Andreas is only a small part of Southern California.

I do see them elsewhere but they just seem so much more prominent in that region so wondering if anyone has spent any time wandering.  I will keep browsing about that area and see if anything stands out.Last point...what about the helipad numbers on top of the buildings?   on top of maze bank...saw an  on  Alta Street I think...does anyone have any thoughts or theories?

At least I think thats a setting off the top of my head.

If you stand on top of the altruist camp as shown above anyone noticed those cops spawning to the cliff left of your position if you are viewing the sunset? Next to the cops spawns a buzzard wich takes off i tried shooting it wich gave me stars imm. Next day same time i tried following it.. It does over the whole map back to LS airport where it keeps going on into the sea.. I messed it up bc after  minutes chasing the buzzard over the sea i accidentally hit the buzzard wich gave me  stars on the spot in the middle of the sea  wich led to hitting the barrier in about  sec after i hit the buzzard.. Anyone knows?EDIT so i was just again at the spot around  then when i saw a car driving off the cliff i went to it. Accidentally hitting a cop who was standing there.. So i got  stars right away. Crazy thing is.. It was very sunny but when i shot down the st helicopter the weather changed into rain and thunder in like  seconds.. I got to  stars at the cliff while thunder was going beserk.. I died ad the cliff with franklin bc of the amount of choppers and ground police..,chiliadmystery,d1ll7ke,1,t5_2yljs

Instead of taking things like segregate and rearrange deciding its an anagram and not a motto saying they are mysterious when they arent and then applying a logic path that was never a path available to begin with.....Rather than it being about the future consider that it is about now.  Again you have people who see things only at a basic level and at face value and then you have GTA showing you the man behind the curtain on everything.

7894267,0,t3_4ncyhd,So just did a bit of testing on this. Put Michael Franklin and Trevor just as he did in the video and found the following Michael will walk in a straight line in the direction that hes facing.  If you let him keep on walking followed him as franklin Hell just walk around the back of the observatory around and back to the street and just start walking down the road. Trevor will sometimes stand still other times just walk in the direction hes facing. He likes to smoke haha.Interestingly it does seem like these three positions are definitely in that category of a puzzle spot Ive heard mentioned before theyll stay standing still if you leave them directly on the bigger plate but if a few steps forward they will walk.Also if you as any one of them walk to the street then it will take longer in the character switch Itll pull out one level into birds eye view if that makes sense Whereas when they are closer on the plates itll just switch without going birds eye.I honestly dont know if this is just random character behavior or if its a part of some puzzle.Its interesting sure but after a fair while of fiddling around with different configurations bringing the space docker chop the space docker and chop testing it on different saves One with cheats then my noncheat save different weather conditions and times I didnt find anything thats really notable at all apart from the M T and F standing still when on the plates.Sorry for the wall of text first time ive done any form of investigation for ages.Kifflom ,chiliadmystery,d43e0ze,10,t5_2yljs

Faded eye glyph ?Now match these to the  boxes on the mural  just like we match. come back when  game completion trigger Red eye glyph observation pointso if we know a single eye means observation point then does it not follow the remaining  glyphs are just observation points that are triggered by the am event.The lighting bolts are probably simple to. just means you need a storm  bolt timer you got the time it takes for ten lighting strikes to get somewhere or do something or somehow get struck by lightingeditjust had a thought what if the idea is to get all  characters and place one at each of the observation glyphs,chiliadmystery,d5ikw79,1,t5_2yljs

If you take  and subtract  you get .  or  to go  in the movie Marty Yells Listen which what you have to do to hunt the beast. Tracks  Track the beast. Also could be a BTTF  reference. Miasma is a rotten smell from sources like dead bodies. Which is technically how bigfoot is hunting the beast. Ebonicsbonics would be a reference to colloquial use of language which would reference the growls. The coin in the top equals cents or scents which you follow to track the beastThe big foot! could reference around the completion percentage or mission number where you see Big Foot in the thermal scopeThe green at the bottom of the painting could be referencing the bush you have to run to in the airport graveyard in order to trigger the beast.

You said you all have already looked at it in this way but just because you dont understand the clues doesnt mean you should move on and try solve the next part of the mystery. You need the clue for that so dont over look them. As for being a newbie! I may be a newbie to this site but not the game. We are all in the same position here we want to solve this but we cant do that if we overlook the glyphs that were given to us by the mount chiliad mural. That is exactly what the mural is. Its a map of where to find the glyphs the next step is the glyphs and only  have been used we need to use the other  for the next step. That is only common sense . The mural isnt an overlay of somewhere else on the map. The egg doesnt pertain to a certain building or location they are all the rewards for solving this mystery that is why there is an egg in the game files that no one has found.

I wouldnt insult a person just because of what they posted no matter what. if I disagree or what not and give a reply then I will try to see if they are saying what I think they are saying. when I know what is meant and I still didnt agree then I still wouldnt ridicule. the replies I get that I fire back at is because I have a good reason for it  whether you can see it or notand not only that but they also show me a few things about that person. its irritating for an fully mature to have to explain things like this when you shouldnt have to when it comes to those that think they have been through all stages of adulthood. dont take this like Im stepping on toes because I do understand its a fact of life. I know I have a hard time getting my point across but understand its not about anyone disagreeing with any of my post its about how you go about replying when the reply tells you the person misunderstood but too immature and inconsiderate and stubborn to know that they could possibly be misunderstanding the person. its hard for adults and youngsters to communicate as it is and its because the full adult knows what young people dont and that is the truth. no if ands or buts about it. at least consider possibilities before ridiculing someone because you just may be wrong.,chiliadmystery,d70hiai,1,t5_2yljs

You said that words not me.. first of all i didnt even suggested a theory at all!... and it wasnt meant to mock other redditors theories.. just trying to figure out why people is more interested in weird theories than the mural interpretation.. which to me is the main thing here.. just an opinion not an accusation.... also im just here for the mystery not worried if people doesent like me.. and last in this entablished sub theres just a  of polite and helpful people.. so idk why i have to be extra polite with people who prejudge without enough knowdledge,chiliadmystery,d784hd0,-1,t5_2yljs

There is also a door on chiliad T that may lead somewhere.  Both of those are equally odd.Reasons to not connect Zancudo to Chiliad.

I dont go to church to say I dont believe in god or go to McDonalds and tell them their food is crapo .The mural is not understood by anybody and anybody claiming that is in denial and denial is not a form of intelligence or control it is just ignorance. There is  glyphs  we understand  the other  still  years have no valid answer even though they are the simplest of the five and most likely relate to viewing positioning  just like the red eye at the top of the mountain how that fits in with lines and radiolightning symbols etc we still dont not have a consensus on .The amount of content put into to this game that relates to he mural mystery is huge so to say this is a half assed mystery gone wrong .....really. ,chiliadmystery,danfpqq,1,t5_2yljs

11061263,0,t3_5xvfx6,I like the electric poles in the triangle and BTTF reference but where is the clock for the lightning to strike? Maybe like in the movie you have to hit it exactly at exactly  pm like in the movie or at am which R may favor.,chiliadmystery,delryci,2,t5_2yljs

11085600,0,t1_deohe5h,Im all for open mindedness and active hunting I just think theres a process to scientific theory and testing that theory and then theres a mad desperate grasp at whatever straw we can clutch in our greedy little hands. Unfortunately I believe this is the latter. I dont think these things really look like what youre suggesting and it should seem relatively obvious at a glance. If more than  of people dont see what youre seeing Id feel like its a safe bet youre wanting to see that.,chiliadmystery,deojk2a,1,t5_2yljs
11107881,0,t1_deqynpq,You dont have to agree and you dont have to help.  Its for the people who want to help.  Yes this community does seem that everyone wants the glory of the next big find but thats only a small percent of the people that also happen to be the loudest. ,chiliadmystery,der2hbe,2,t5_2yljs
11125034,1,t1_desa6vf,A YDR is not a shaderIt is a drawable. It uses cable.sps which BTW all cables ingame use. This is actually just artifacting as the cable isnt a physical object. So no.. No electric can be drawn nor is there a PTFX attached to these cables. ,chiliadmystery,det0hl5,0,t5_2yljs

11299051,0,t1_df8s656,gtThats likely because thats a basic expectation to anyone going into the hunt. And posting that is like going to an Area  conspiracy subreddit and saying Like hey man maybe aliens dont exist! Lets stop posting here.No one is saying lets stop posting here.  I think there is still stuff to unravel in the game and looking into the code is worth doing to figure out what exactly the mural was trying to say with each individual X line and icon.But that includes accepting the very real possibility that theres nothing more to be found except the UFOs.  And not being butthurt at the mere suggestion of it.gtMost people here already have the thought in the back of their mind of no shit of course theres always the chance that theres nothing left to find. Especially if were not currently finding anything but the people that do return to hunt do so for funas a hobby or to make that doubt definitive.Yeah not really.  I would argue thats  the opposite of the thought process of most of the people here.  Have you read some of these posts?  They seem to be physically allergic to the concept that there isnt a major insanely huge secret left in the game.Most of them freak the fuck out at just the suggestion of a chance that theres nothing major left to find.   A lot of them are here looking for a minute cut scene jetpack alien abduction content the observatory to turn into a female alien vagina opening her legs to the stars Nikola Tesla to become an NPC and turn the Space Docker into a Delorean et cetera et cetera.  Thats not a group that seems particularly concerned with rational intellectual honesty to me.gtPeople making posts on a sub dedicated to hunting saying maybe we should stop hunting defeats the point. No ones saying that.  Hunting is good.  I think there are things unfound in the game myself though probably small and nothing related to the mural.The problem is when you are hunting with a nonskeptical eye which results in you hunting for things you believe exist in the game without evidence rather than just hunting and finding whatever is there.In science approach B gets you vaccines and microcomputers and space travel approach A gets you moon landing and  conspiracy theories.  And on the small scale of this sub approach A has resulted in most of the good skeptical people leaving and most of the nutters flooding the joint with shitposts.gtBasically we all have doubts. My personal belief is that it was cut content for an unfinished raid on Zancudo. But people leaving posts saying Thats all folks doesnt contribute anything in my opinion.I dont say thats all folks.  I say the following the mural is probably about the UFOs now lets reverse engineer what the puzzle was supposed to be because its still not  clear what the lines Xs and tile icons are for though I have a good theory   lets keep poring through the code and discussing it to see if there actually is anything left in the game and I will be happy to be proven wrong.Unfortunately that twopronged process which I think would be really productive is shortcircuited by the obsessive nutters who only want to mentally masturbate with their latest word theory of GTA IS REALLY ABOUT insert last deep thing I stumbled over on Wikipedia here!!!!!!Nothing good ever comes from that and if we dont point out that those theories are retarded we are never going to get anywhere because as you can see from this sub those types of things overwhelm rational discussion and the people who post them react to criticism like little titty babies who never heard an opposing argument.,chiliadmystery,dfcqb4c,1,t5_2yljs

11313931,0,t1_dfcz0lq,Disagree if the cap fits. This guy continues to visit this sub even though he is adamant that the mystery is  already solved. Most sane or normal people would have left and moved on as they would be happy with their conclusion but not this guy. He seems to enjoy antagonising the majority of the sub that continue to believe there is more left in the game. So in my eyes the word cunt is completely fitting for his person.,chiliadmystery,dfeezr1,2,t5_2yljs

11376460,0,t1_dflhzwq,No when I say cry cave I mean the one on the east coast fairly near to the humane labs I think... in Lesters house there is a newspaper with the headline man discovers cry cave or something like that and Lester has drawn a UFO above it xDAnd I may have the number of locations very wrong lol sorry.It is the location just before Mt Gordo in the list second to last I believe,chiliadmystery,dfli373,2,t5_2yljs
