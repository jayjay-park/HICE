I still need to keep my single  box for VCenter . which only after a year of being out VMWare decided that  was good enough for vCenter. The one thing I ran into was that I forgot to change my key in the TS out to the new one or just delete it alltogether since i was using a KMS client key.

389849,0,t1_cfl5vcu,I did use Dells exclusively at a previous company but right now Im using all HP machines. I do use a WMI query to name the PCs when I image them but Id like to get them into the system well before that point. Right now when the boxes come off of the truck our receiving department will manually copy the serial number place a corporate sticker on the machine and rebox it. They will then copy the info into a spreadsheet. The PCs might sit around for weeks afterward before they are imaged. Id like for them to be able to scan the PCs or even the number on the outside of the unopened boxes and have that info automatically go into our system. And thats just for a start. Il like to be able to assign an owner to a PC that is separate from the Primary User that I can already define in SCCM.

1791796,0,t3_2eaz1o,Its typically not the best idea to create an image with everything baked in. The best way to achieve it is to use a generic WIM that has Windows tweaks such as HKLM registry values or installing components like .NET. Its also a great idea to install the latest Windows Updates.Break it into that single image and it shouldnt be more than about GB. Use the task sequence to lay down applications drivers and any other custom modifications you may want.If you really have to use a WIM image with applications or whatever baked in make a separate DATA WIM and use the Task Sequence step Apply Data Image to the destination drive.If the OS image exceeds GB it can start to cause errors which is why it get split into multiple GB files.,SCCM,ck508sr,1,t5_2t39l

Ive got a Citrix upgrade project in motion that I cant finish while I keep getting pulled back into SCCM and other projects in the queue in security which is where I want to be.Thats a management problem.

So SCCM recognizes that the object has client finds the optional advertisement but then that TS fails because it has client on the machine or thinks it does and the slow to update TS is only pxe and media.The sluggishness of the whole SCCM updating is making this pretty much useless though.

A batch file or a PSAppDeploy or whatever.Set the Package to be deployed to all the systems with whatever application it needs to update.Set the package to rerun every day at PMSet the package to refresh every day at AM or whatever or every  hours or whatever interval you want.That to me would be pretty simple The systems would get the refreshed files every single day whether or not they changed at the given time. If the files are updated great. If not well they get the same files pushed down to them.We do something kindasorta like this for CTL files we have a server that pulls the CTLs every day at AM. At AM the package is refreshed. At AM a the package reruns on a few servers that host the files voila! New files are placed or the same files are just refreshed either way.The biggest downside of this is the repeated placement of files.

While on paper the option to define the order on collections sounds really nice it is not really useful if you need to keep to administrate a list with hundreds of servers.

Its not actually just registry values either there is actually a group policy provider that enables this functionality that ultimately does manifest as values in the registry though.I think the reason they didnt support this on Windows  was either because something was fixed in Win  that they needed or they simply chose not to support it to limit their testing  dont really know.,SCCM,d632vab,1,t5_2t39l

Your maintenance window either needs to be longer than  hours or you need to shorten the restart timer though you need to be aware that having less than  minutes is bad for your endusers.When you specify these computer restart settings ensure that the value for the restart temporary notification interval and the value for the final countdown interval are shorter in duration than the shortest maintenance window that is applied to the computer.,SCCM,d9pwz2m,1,t5_2t39l

I see youre using IISCrypto and its best practices template is good enough to keep you from being vulnerable to TLS . attacks iirc.Disabling TLS . is also not required yet if youre under PCI compliance. Wont be required by PCIDSS until June . If your auditors say otherwise tell them to update their requirements docs. Theres so much that will currently break if you disable TLS . that its not worth it. If you properly configure your cipher suites ciphers and hashes availability you wont be vulnerable to BEAST LogJam or FREAK among others even with TLS . enabled.Im also kind of thinking that the PCI council will back off of the TLS . disable in favor of getting people to properly configure their cipher suites ciphers and hashes availability. It was startlingly quick how fast they back pedaled on the date from June  to June .Side note Exchange  will currently break if you disable TLS .. Crosssite replication intramailbox database send will break and external mail receipt will break. Seems everything depends on TLS . being available and wont fault up to . or ..,SCCM,daa18ao,2,t5_2t39l
