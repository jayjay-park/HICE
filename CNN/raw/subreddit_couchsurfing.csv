698115,0,t1_cgjio31,I am giving myself  lot of options actually. ive been looking for jobs for a month pro cover letter and resume   apps in total and the only reason I stopped is because now I dont have a place to live or a way to get there. Shelters are telling my case worker and I sorry but she has to be working first. Weve been looking for a month. Ive been fighting tooth and nail not being lazy. And Im in a wheelchair part time because I get paralysis and standing for too long makes me fall down. Id LOVE to do that but do you see how no one would take me? Couchsurfing ad was something I knew wouldnt work but Im getting fairly desperate. . Unfortunately things have gone downhill fast despite my work to the contrary and I will soon be living outside where it will be nearly impossible to get work or be seen as a respectable human being. And its hot out there. I almost fainted today when I was trying to go see a case worker who was going to try and get me housing  she stood me up by the way. I dont have a bus pass anymore either. I dont know how Im going to survive in the heat since less than an hour combined in it nearly caused me to faint a few times today. Plus I dont have the energy to walk a long time. If you see a girl with black hair and a wc and she looks really weak if not completely ill and maybe dying thats me! D. IDK. I hope a miracle happens or I die soon. ,couchsurfing,cgjmmhu,1,t5_2qs85

2465439,0,t3_2nq83s,The blog post was written by someone who has never even surfed! I couldnt be bothered to go to the effort to understand the community and be a good surfer therefore CouchSurfing is going out of style.They are two platforms for two different communities. You cant compare them side by side. One may be used more often than the other but even if the actual organization that is CouchSurfing.org fails people will still be opening their homes to travelers for free around the world. Its just a means to an end thats going to get reached one way or another.AirBnB on the other hand is really necessary as a safe mediator between someone exchanging payment for goods and services. If its not AirBnB people who arent comfortable running their home as a business will need another third party company to step up and offer the same safety net and technical platform. Ive used both as a host and as a guest.However I usually travel extremely frugally with little to no cash on me ...and without participating in the CouchSurfing community Id have to be doing a lot more groundwork than sorting through some profiles online and maybe reshuffling a plan or two on occasion. Old school style making friend on a street or in a bar and hoping they have some space to crash.If you go into the CouchSurfing community with the right attitude and give the best of yourself in exchange its one of the most rewarding things you can be a part of IMHO. Its a huge networked example of What Goes Around Comes Around. So much more than a place to stay for the night even if yes a host falls through sometimes.Theyre both great resources but one is an idea and community bigger than the site itself the other is opening up personalsized bed and breakfasts relying on the platform to be successful.,couchsurfing,cmgffxs,5,t5_2qs85

4146234,0,t1_crgbb16,To me it sounds like you need to do a better job of choosing hosts that have more similar interests.  Read profiles and especially references carefully and look for signs that youre not a good match i.e. references include comments of partying with host.  If you havent already perhaps you need to make it more clear in your profile that youre a vegetarian who doesnt like drinking clubs prefers outdoors in long term relationship etc so that your host knows exactly who hes accepting and can make the right match as well.  As for the final incident tbh I would probably be a little annoyed as well although Im sure I would have articulated it better than he did.  It was a bit selfish on your part to inconvenience this woman and ask her to go on a  min journey late at night just so you could save a few dollars on a taxi.  You knew she would most likely say no so why even put her in the awkward position to have to say no?  Perhaps for him you came across as a needy person and this was the final tipping point.  Anyways like the others are saying just chalk it up to experience and move on.  Im sure he will as well and hopefully each of you will take this as a learning experience and find better matches next time around.  It doesnt sound like anything to leave a negative or neutral review for.  You just werent a good fit and sometimes that happens.  You might make mention of it in the review but I would mainly focus on the positives.  It sounds like you spent a lot of time together so surely you can think of a few ,couchsurfing,crsvxi7,3,t5_2qs85

But not all surfers have the common sense and good manners to volunteer to buy their hosts a gift that at least offsets the costs of hosting. Many surfers still cling to the infantile notion that the world exists to provide for them.Cultural exchange? Pay it forward? That sounds wonderful but that is not my experience. Most surfers are parasites who surf and surf and then never host and never contribute anything to the community. Their promises of hosting me if I visit their cities are worthless.Again I may not be interested in running a forprofit endeavor but a cultural exchange that costs me  in verification plus  in added utility costs per month when the guests pay nothing at all is parasitism at its best.,couchsurfing,cuxxyiu,-2,t5_2qs85

6053320,0,t1_cy8sfro,I was also really worried traveling as a solo female traveler. Also my first time Couchsurfing was supposed to happen in Mumbai India. Not the safest place for women as you might have heard. It turned out to be my most wonderful travel memory so here are a few pointers  choose someone with LOTS of references and preferably mixed couples males females etc.  Message them to get a feel for the person.  Your gut is always right. You dont want to find out why something feels wrong if it does. No room for politeness when its about your safety. On the other hand if it feels good go with it. I even went to the middle of nowhere with my host because he was just a really good human being.  Be super clear about your own intentions. My host knew I have a boyfriend and was not interested in anything remotely romantic well ahead before I arrived at his place.  Dont get drunk its still a stranger who you just met.  If youre interested you can check out my experiences in my YouTube vlogs. My channel is called EnterpriseMe TV. Also if you are coming to Amsterdam feel free to send me a message.

If you do get an acceptance please remember to cancel all other outstanding requests. A short note saying you found other lodging is pro forma.

11516604,0,t1_dfzul34,My hosting experience has been the same so far more requests from girls and consequently more hosting of girls.Id hate to think that counts against me when I send requests but so be it. I wouldnt want to be hosted by anyone who has any reservations about me.,couchsurfing,dg1epw0,2,t5_2qs85
11561822,0,t1_dg69zh1,Someone pointed out something about maybe not having been super clear on house rules which is why I was thinking I might leave a positive reference. I dont know Im pretty open and direct so Id just talk to the person first instead of try to imply something. Some people myself included are bad at picking up on hints so Ill straight out say you need to take a shower!  Ive never had a bad surfer so maybe Im just too kind towards him. If this had happened at my place after Id directly told him whats what then yeah it would be negative. But most of the time Id chalk this kind of thing up to poor communication first.,couchsurfing,dg6jcif,4,t5_2qs85

11764767,0,t3_66ahx1,Im late s and both surf and host. I think in general hosts tend to be older than surfers. Mostly because they have more financial resources and living situations that allow hosting. Whereas a lot of younger people live in situations that dont allow hosting such as with parents or in dorms. But yes most young people only use CS when they want free beds and never think to host when they do have the resources for it.I find it a bit hypocritical that young people will happily surf with someone  years older but find it creepy if someone  years older wants to surf with them.Ive surfed with  year old hosts even females and met up with  year olds. I always had good experiences. Maybe because the people willing to host someone older are interesting and open minded. For any young person hesitant to host someone older heres another benefit. We are far less likely to be freeloaders. We are doing this for the experience. We have money and will probably pay for everyting the whole time.For older people surfing with young people you need to be open to whatever the experience is. If you have to sleep on the floor of a dorm do it. If theyre going to a club until am go. It will all be an adventure.,couchsurfing,dgtke3d,3,t5_2qs85
