1099462,0,t3_25w4ro,I absolutely love the raffle system. I get your point but what people seem to forget is that it is evenly weighted  if a map has  and the other has  the latter will get voted very rarely.Its also given me the chance to play a ton of maps Ive barely played before and broadened the selection of maps. If you look at the hive people are always complaining about it always being SG.Basically I think its better to have variety and the occasional annoying map choice than no annoying map choices but no variety  just my opinion though.,MCSG,cht9iff,1,t5_2txvo
