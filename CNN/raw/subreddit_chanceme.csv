4895172,0,t3_3hw5fu,Hi. I cant chance you exactly but I can tell you why I think youre a strong candidate for all the schools you mention including those in the top tier. First you have two possible hooks  achieving in science patent publications Intel ISEF and  being an underrepresented minority. Second youve done well in challenging classes and on the SAT. Third you have lots of other extracurricular stuff going on. So it all looks good.However if I might hazard a guess I would say youre probably not the type of person who is happy with good  you want to know what you can do better. Here are  questions that you might find usefulIs there a fifth academic class you can take senior year? In my area students take AP government  econ. Maybe youve already taken that. If thats the case you might consider taking another look at what else is available at your school. Youre going to be compared against others at your school so if possible think about taking on a fifth academic class to keep your strength of schedule high.Who is writing your letters of recommendation? This is one of those mysterious but important factors. Not a first tier factor like GPA and SAT but a second tier factor that becomes especially important when youre applying to selective schools. If you dont already have teachers in mind think it over. When you broach the topic youre looking for enthusiasm not Well I guess I could write you a letter of rec... I know forgive me for being obvious but Ive seen it happen.What will you say in your essay? For many highachieving students the instinct is to shock and awe the reader with accomplishment and success. However as youve probably read or heard the essay isnt always the best place for that. Look the honors and awards section and the activities list will show your achievements. The essay is about giving the reader a sense of what its like to walk in your shoes  to understand the everyday moments that have shaped you. I ask my students to focus their essays on character not achievement. Shock and awe not necessary. Surprise and delight perfectly acceptable.Now I know your original question was about your chances for the schools you listed. Have you seen the college tool at Parchment Parchment is a service that sends transcripts and collects student data including college preferences and they have tried to turn that data into college tools. As a disclaimer Im not a fan of the fact that you have to sign up for an account to use some of these tools. But one of these tools is  you guessed it  a college chance tool. If you follow the link above and click on a school youll have the chance to create an account and answer some questions about your stats and background. Then it gives you a  chance of admission. If you would be willing I think it would be interesting for a lot of the people in this subreddit to see what percentages Parchment spits out based on your data. Im definitely curious...but no pressure!Jon ,chanceme,cubkql3,3,t5_3268q

Michigan Berkeley UCLA UNCCH UVA. As an out of state student you may not qualify for much aid but it may be worth it to applyconsider. Graduating from one of these schools will provide a significant return on your investment.Also apply to private schools. Shoot for a few Ivies because your background EC and uniqueness will make you somewhat competitive. Consider USC Georgetown NYU etc. Expensive schools but are generous in giving money to lowincome students.Also apply to UGA Alabama. You will qualify for a meritfullride scholarship.

Play up your Muslimness while you are just like everyone else and appreciate all types of diversity but make it real and within the context of your life and experience. They want minorities and diversity that they can claim within their demographic statistics. So even if your dad is a cardioligist all your friends are white and you love the yankees they can add another Muslim to the list  and Muslim is the hot liberal minority right now so hot! No top school needs more asians and south asians so play up the muslim card. Nothing better for a university than a muslim who isnt an arab.Aside from that real but politically incorrect advice Id say with a   . you should definitely get into Stony Brook RPI GA Tech GW Illinois Hopkins Rochester CMU.If you get waitlisted at Hopkins Rochester GW or CMU its because they dont think youre going to go there anyway because you got in somewhere better. So if those are your best choices once you hear from all schools just follow up and express you strong interest to admissions and you can get off the waitlist. The essay  personality means more at private schools.GA Tech Stony Brook amp Illinois are state schools so admissions are more about grades and scores. If you have certain gradesscores and there is room you get in. State residents get priority but you really help bring their average SAT up. You are way above average for those schools.Princeton Cornell Northwestern...you could very well get in but you never know. Princeton would be the least likely but its still not unlikely.
