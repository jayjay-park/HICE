How do you ensure that thisgt...but that only Bob and David know what the waving of a white flag means.is true?gtwhereby the meaning is only known between the two intended parties beforehandThat is a code or code word. It is encoded in a system know to at least the communicating parties. Its the substitution of an entire message by some transmitted object or idea. But one could also develop a protocol for the encoding and I believe it is then deemed a cipher. But the dictionary Im referencing appears to be in my handwriting...,encryption,cnhocxc,2,t5_2qhvx

6825685,0,t3_494o8w,Yes I know it is far to much this was done while being very bored and to make sure I can still do such things as it has been a few years since last worked on any security that isnt the most basic. As for the USB failing yes that is a problem however I loath leaving passwords or good hints on anything connected to the internet. Never truly felt safe with a pass manager either they always seemed like they could fail or have a backdoor.,encryption,d0pzocy,1,t5_2qhvx
7149304,0,t3_4dg8tn,As a start you need to understand asymmetric and symmetric cryptography.Know at a high level what ECC RSA and AES are. Also know when why and how theyre implemented on systems. Understand the weaknesses and specific vulnerabilities of each. Know what entropy is and know how to compute entropy vs. a particular encryption method.At a higher level you also need to understand information security which is the when why and how to use which methods of encryption among others. How can you be sure your WPA WiFi connection is secure? How is a Bluetooth connection secured? How much overhead does encryption cause and is it acceptable to use on a particular system this is especially important in the internet of things.,encryption,d1qsx88,2,t5_2qhvx

So yeah it has role in securing our privacy on our mobile devices and I have learned about it via purevpn as they help users understand the need even better!,encryption,d4yktn4,1,t5_2qhvx
