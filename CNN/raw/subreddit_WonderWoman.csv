686679,0,t1_cgiawaj,Well the way I saw it including actors who played preSuperman Clark regardless of how long Welling did it wouldve opened the door to tons of people like James Newton Gerard Christopher Jeff East Stephan Bender Dylan Sprayberry etc. And while Welling did essentially play Superman in a couple scenes during the series finale I didnt think that quite counted especially since Welling never actually wore the suit which was mapped onto him via CGI.Similarly I left Bruce Thomas off the Batman piece since he was only in a couple scenes in the Birds of Prey pilot. Also left off Cathy Lee Crosby and Adrianne Palicki from the WW piece as theyd only starred in one failed pilot each.,WonderWoman,cgibrxz,7,t5_2sb3r
1323088,0,t1_ciigcku,She hasnt been on the main screens because she is so great and powerful NO ONE can take her on and play her right. Instead of settling and selling her out and having someone not play her properly. Youre telling me you prefer the change in her out fit yet youre telling me its not about her outfit or how she looks but you clearly are making the same type of judgement as I just from the other side. I love Wonder Woman and everything she represents. If people dont buy her books or comics for stupid reasons then fuck them they dont deserve her as a hero then. She wont go anywhere in my heart and her comics and stories will live forever for me to read. You have an opinion you like her new outfit. Clearly I like her and so do you. I dont care if other people do or dont. I would like her to myself anyway. I dont know what it is youre trying to say lol ,WonderWoman,ciigq2m,1,t5_2sb3r

2019665,0,t3_2hv3fi,Sorry on a phone but this a problem I am having with DC lately. They are going for a darker tone and they have heroes killing in acts that are supposed to be justified. None of them should be killing. I understand why they had superman kill zod in mos. It was to lay the groundwork for his aversion to killing. But wonder woman is from an advanced society. Amazons should be beyond killing. Our superheroes arent supposed to be us they are supposed to be better the way we want to be. This country is getting bloodthirsty with terrorists corruption and a steady stream of horrors in the  hour news cycle but we should want to be better. Its not naivete to want our heroes to be better to save and help people to bring evil to justice not just to kill the badguy and say screw it.,WonderWoman,ckwke0t,4,t5_2sb3r

3436845,0,t3_2za0ch,Wonder Woman  was pushed to April st probably due to David Finch being late and besides the first week DC will only publish Convergence so thats why the Annual was pushed to June.Wonder Woman  will come back April st as well Marc Andreyko said so on twitter and Matt Haley one of the artists of the first arc posted some art on facebook first BampW and then colored by Romulo Fajardo Jr. It will probably be  parts released April st th and th then the print version coming April nd.EDITED It seems it was pushed to April th so it might be  parts or just one week pause between the digital and print. Would make more sense to be  parts though that would be  pages of story each digital issue is around  pages in print  ads or extras.,WonderWoman,cpk0xt0,2,t5_2sb3r

3725474,0,t1_cqgmr48,I love Whedon. I think hes a great writer and a great director. Buffy is easily my favorite television series and something that has had a huge impact on my life. When I heard he was going Wonder Woman back when it was still a thing I was ecstatic. Then he left the project and I wondered why. Then he started talking about the script a little here and there and it sounded off. He seemed like he was trying to make a Wonder Woman movie without having Wonder Woman or anything resembling Wonder Woman. Then the script leaked and for the first time in my life I was glad Joss was not on the project. In his quest to make Diana more relatable he stripped away every defining characteristic of who she is and what she stands for and instead just focused on one aspect the fish out of water. It was clear that he was trying to make his own superhero but was attempting to do it in the confines of what could reasonably be called a Wonder Woman movie. I love Whedon but I am glad his Wonder Woman was not made.,WonderWoman,cqgxh0y,5,t5_2sb3r
4780195,0,t3_3gdf6b,This is a great set. It features one of the best Wonder Woman origin stories with a fantastic animated movie all in one inexpensive package. If you are looking for a good starting point for Wonder Woman have never read Gods and Mortals or have never seen the animated film I highly suggest picking up this set.,WonderWoman,ctx31ml,3,t5_2sb3r
6144354,0,t1_cynzvbv,I agree that for the origin well have to wait until theres another linewide continuity reboot a la Crisis or New .

7010515,0,t3_4bn7rl,Holy shit. If thats true that is amazing. Nothing against Bennett I think shed be a great choice for Wonder Woman. But Rucka has proven to be one of the writers who really gets Diana. This would be an incredible turn of events. Also that would bode well for a future Batwoman book by Rucka which is something I desperately want.,WonderWoman,d1azlbl,7,t5_2sb3r
7672190,0,t1_d1t6g0p,The book had some very good moments I also agree with the Steve Trevor comment and I also really loved the nonviolent Wonder Woman. Overall I wanted to like the book but the fact that Amazonians treat with derision the human world and send Medusa to it no matter how many other victims there are I guess Diana can reverse their transformation but it seems this was something they didnt know before made me dislike the book overall. Mostly for the portrayal of the Amazons.,WonderWoman,d3ea7jj,1,t5_2sb3r

I was hyped for BvS am currently hyped for Suicide Squad but THIS film I have been waiting on for most of my life. Words cant express how I feel. Frankly I get emotional every time something like this is released. God I hope its good. Ill cry like a father at his daughters wedding if it is.

9658582,0,t1_d9yrt3i,Coincidentally I saw this video a couple of days AFTER this thread had died but I think it fits appropriately here Even in the mids Stan Lee already realised that even when the publisher was demanding him to not worry about characterization and plot and to just focus on the action he wanted to do more and he was likegtI wanna write a story and not just all of that nonsense. And so the Fantastic Four was born the rest is history. And to hear this ChoCensored guy say the exact opposite just makes my balls itch. Pardon my Abrahamism.Azzarello and now Rucka again wrote such great stories for Wonder Woman. I agree that Rucka is doing far too well to just leave anytime soon.EditSpellings,WonderWoman,da3mewa,2,t5_2sb3r
