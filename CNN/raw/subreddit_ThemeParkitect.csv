2876134,0,t1_cnuxliz,Its another example of one of the first things I made. Ill probably change it a little bit but the park entrance is going to remain a pretty big structure. Theres a gameplay reason for it that we havent worked on quite yet. In my mind its also where the park offices are and it should feel like a pretty grande structure inspirations for it being Europa Park Its pretty much the same and DisneylandWorlds stationlike buildingsTheres going to be another fairly large structure on the park border too but more on that later.,ThemeParkitect,cnv0n1o,1,t5_32750

4347693,0,t1_csfc3ge,The thinking is that if the entire fence is perfectly on the edge you can only build one thing on an edge and itd clip even worse for example into vertical terrain. If you put it entirely on one side including the posts situations like this become problematic or corners where you have one fence on the inside of the tile and the other fence on the outside. Either you use multiple posts next to each other which we thought looks stupid or you got a noticeable gap?  Couldnt find a perfect solution so we used the one that has the least downsides in our opinion. Heres a fence next to a hedge,ThemeParkitect,csfptqr,9,t5_32750
4548402,0,t3_3bz53k,I dont see the need for this feature.  It was never missed in RCT or RCT and adds nothing to the game in RCT.If you want to design coasters and ride them as a simulation then No Limits does a better job than any theme park management game will ever do.,ThemeParkitect,ct3y8b8,1,t5_32750

5079566,0,t3_3kd45u, Guests were making comments on how great the staff werehow clean the park was and the park wasnt opened yet and no staff hired. Using the Follow Camera for coasters I noticed the train movement to be a bit choppy when zoomed nearto the max  while the surrounding environment scrolled around super silky. It was as if the background had some kind of vertical synclike movement while the coasters had it turned off best I can describe it even though VSync has nothing to do with it I bet.  Stackable scenery on almost anything that would make sense to do so  and collision detection turned off on objects like logs rocks etc. for realism and it give it a less gridlike appearance.  Height markers are kind of hard to read for us older folk. When you zoom in the height markers remain the same  tiny size.. the gray background on the markers makes it more difficult. Very excited about the product. Laying down path is heavenly!,ThemeParkitect,cuya363,3,t5_32750

5113345,0,t1_cv1j6jm,This report just says that its untrustworthy because its a new file that less than  people in the Norton Community have used yet.

5683150,0,t1_cx1gxv7,Ah understandable. Theres a click a drag tool already so will be interesting to see what else would be added. I was actually around near the beggining of RCT modding. But I gotta take into account there is a major difference RCT did not have any prerelease phases and already came with scenery that was used as size guides.Thanks for mentioning  meter is  tile. That will be useful. A bit off topic but since you seem to know a good amount about the game do you happen to know the height of the park guests? ,ThemeParkitect,cx1jtku,3,t5_32750

6013951,0,t3_3vesoj,Built a coaster with two station platforms one on each side of the park forming a loop. In the train settings when adjusting the number of cars it populates the first station until its full and then begins to populate the next station. For my coaster it would be better if the cars were evenly distributed among the stations. As the coaster operates cars pile up at the first station waiting for the other cars to loadunload leaving the other station with fewno cars at any given time.That leads to my second suggestion under operations the waiting time is a nice feature but it would be helpful to have a few additional options. In my case a wait for load or leave if another train arrives option would be useful.,ThemeParkitect,cy7ygap,3,t5_32750
