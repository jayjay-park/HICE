1597560,0,t1_cjg53ux,A suggestion as complicated as the one presented in your link is bound to failure. At the point when Israel can claim Palestinian encroachment because the boundaries are difficult to follow Israel would usurp the little land that they conceded and blame fault on the Palestinians. ,MideastPeace,cjgji8c,1,t5_2rm56

4853854,0,t1_cu6ad79,gt Chaim Weizmann telling the Peace Conference in you have read the FaisalWeizmann agreement right?...and the claim for the Jewish homeland that included that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing nonJewish communities in Palestineand this mean i can judge the palestinians by the words of Haj Amin alHusseini  Hitlers friend? i can cherry pick too you know...,MideastPeace,cu6d4r3,-1,t5_2rm56
4868151,0,t1_cu83wit,gt Zionist Jihadist ... oh this is a great one...Chaim Weizmann was supposedly an immensely clever chemist I say that some doubt about his process and a religious fanatic. gt and the Zionist position was with the same term of the Balfour declaration...no harm to the non Jewish communities...But it wasnt was it? to be as Jewish as France was French was freely being expressed years earlier.gt your interpretation skill is terrible and your argument empty.If say Baghdadi went to a Conference in Saudi and announced that he wanted to partition the UK and make it as Muslim as Medina and Mecca and the Conference agreed to that partition and carried it out I would consider that an existential threat to my existene in my own country.The fault of the Palestinians is that they did not explode in hatred and anger in  when this disaster could have been averted however much Weizmann wanted it.gt the Palestinians lived in the jaffa area that is a ridiculous argument.Did you check the Biblical reference I gave you? The borders of the land given to Moses are here gt you are ignoring the meaning of civil war.When the Germans invaded Poland the resulting bloodshed was not Civil War.Just as the Zionists in Palestine was not a Civil War.It was a war of aggression Lebensraum.gt so the christians of Nazareth are still in Nazareth heh? does not look good for your argument.The number of Christians in Palestine crashed from  to  in  and David Ben Gurion ordered Nazareth to be ethnically cleansed.The town was only saved because Ben Dunkelman insisted on the order in writing.When Israel opens its archives and owns up to their Wannsee Conference which they called the Long Seminar Dec st  to nd January  then well be able to see it.Israel also needs to reopen David Ben Gurions archive personally closed by Netanyahu since much of the Long Seminar stuff is in there.gt absurdly gentle...are you fucking mental?Absurdly gentle  the Palestinians had  years between  and  when they could have dealt with the guntoting and stickwielding Zionists.Their failure to do so led directly to this catastrophe  and has very nearly led to WW.gt you need physiological helpNot me who is defending Lebensraum.,MideastPeace,cu8619o,1,t5_2rm56
