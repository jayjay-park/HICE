573414,0,t1_cg0n1k9,Very true. Most players breaking into jazz go through at least a moment of thinking strictly in modes in diatonic progressions. The mode thing only works if youre playing something that stays on one chord for multiple measures and changes keys when it changes chords  e.g. Davis Flamenco Sketches. Learn your arpeggios and learn the importance of chord tones. rds and ths of chords take precedent over roots and ths. From there get comfortable locating ths or bs for dominant chords.

603006,0,t1_cg8sdt6,Thanks man!!! Im kinda jealous I want a viola! Ill probably end up getting a string electric violin.Listening to a lot of different artists really helped me develop my own style. Turtle Island String Quartet Tracy Silverman Joe Venutti and of course Stephane Grappelli are all amazing artists to listen to and learn from. Also using playalongs are great for practicing scales modes and licks. I used Jamie Aebersold and Jerry Coker playalongs. You can probably find them online. Can you read music? A good practice if you want to completely learn a specific artists style is to transcribe solos. There is special software that allows you to slow down the track without altering the pitch that can help you get the harder parts. After you transcribe practice and play along...thats how I learned Coltranes solo on the original Giant Steps record.Hope this helps!,Jazz,cg8tcu5,1,t5_2qmm6

A lot of my favorite producers like Ott and drum n bass guys like Dieselboy changed their sound to be more like dubstep and those rhythms just make me sick. This group does the same for me. If they were playing anything at all but dubstep Id be a staunch supporter because I think theyre fantastic players who definitely know their way around a horn.

Then theres the protests songs. Why are they so awful?  I was so looking forward to listening to Abbey Lincolns protest music and its awful too. But then the same thing has been said of protest poetry. A local noted activist where I live was a poet as well and people would ask him why dont you do more poetry and his reply was first things first. Sometimes protest poetry is just naturally simpler in some ways. One of my favorite lines of his he was Dennis Brutus a South African who had been in prison with Nelson Mandela was very simple Justice justice justice.

1611990,0,t1_cji6fqs,I just read that article you linked to and I agree with pretty much everything Payton is saying. He is using a very common progressive definition of racist i.e. prejudiced in accord with the systemic power structure. That definition allows the word racism to retain its true meaning without being watered down. Racism  institutionalized racism and white privilege. Maybe on other planets there are green supremacists or purple supremacists but on this planet at this time particularly in the United States racism  white supremacy. Payton is a Black man who grew up in the south born a mere  years after MLK was assassinated  Im pretty sure he knows a thing or two about racism.I think its pretty hilarious that youre calling a Black man racist partially because he feels persecuted. ,Jazz,cjicwpi,1,t5_2qmm6

1803669,0,t3_2f6w62,I dont think of love supreme as a free tempo dorian vamp but more as a spiritual meditation. It takes the magic away from the music if the musicality is at the forefrontThis is something a lot young of players do and its so hard to have to work with. Always trying to find faults in others playing or overanalyze the music. If you do this too much it can get to the point where you cant listen to music. I know a guy who did this with every single tune he heard stopped listening for  years. Emotion is the language we speak when we play everyone understands it in their own way. Jazz musicians have the musical tools to do things people dont understand and I think that it self brings up many emotions and reactions. It gets really interesting when you no longer can comprehend what theyre doing. If you want jazz to survive youll need to do work at the grassroots level community building stuff. It is not that hard if you have dedicated hardworking people. And a lot of those kinds of places and people do exist so I think were good for now! But the best thing we as single individuals is to take our kids to jazz gigs the spacier the better. I remember when I was  mom took me to this opening of a gallery.

1826520,0,t3_2fgx3s,To answer that question you first have to answer the question what is jazz?Clearly Jazz grew out of different forms of music especially blues which has a deep history as black music if you want to call it that. As it developed it grew into much larger than just an extension of this. It gained influences from other types of music. Black and White musicians alike developed the genre as they saw fit. Now its a worldwide genre with distinctive flavours. Is latin jazz black music? Is bigband black music? Is japanese jazz with electronic influences black music?Define jazz however youd like and then find the answer for whichever jazz is jazz to you. For me jazz is so much there is no added value in calling it black music. History is one thing today is another. Today it is worldwide.,Jazz,ck9abt4,1,t5_2qmm6

Jazz hasnt been in the popular music spotlight since the s. I havent looked too closely but I would imagine jazz in the s occupied the same type of space that hiphop exists in today as almost a secondary pop music underneath what is massively popular.What Im saying is popculture has nothing to do with the decline of jazz. Even if you want to take a shortsighted look and say todays pop music is different than Michael Jackson and The Beatles because todays pop music doesnt take any talent! jazz had already fallen off of its pedestal long before todays music was around.,Jazz,cms6c2z,4,t5_2qmm6

2693861,0,t3_2qu5l5,Check out this website There are all kinds of bootleg concerts on here that I would imagine you cant find anywhere else. Not necessarily obscure bands but definitely obscure music given that every performance of the same tune in jazz is so different although now with the internet very few things are actually obscure.    There are a bunch of really amazing bootlegs by Kurt Rosenwinkels band with Mark Turner from the early s in Boston. I actually didnt get these from the site I got them from a buddys hard drive at university. Not sure where they are or how they circulate but theyve got to be accessible somewhere. Anyway they do a lot of the repertoire from The Next Step and tear through it.    Theres one particular bootleg of Gateway Trio from Hamburg in . Completely crazy. They do a twenty minute Bessies Blues where they are constantly breaking down.    There are a couple of interesting Chris Potter bootlegs where they do the repertoire from The Sirens. One with David Virelles on piano where they just go completely insane that might be my favorite performance Ive ever heard by Potters band and a couple with Ethan Iverson that are less intense but still definitely worth listening to.    As for obscure albums there were these two Benoit Delbecq albums that released on the same day a few years ago that are very incredible. I dont know that hes obscure but I definitely dont hear people talk about him a lot. He plays prepared piano and I guess you would call it free jazz but a lot of it is written and ostinato based. One of the albums Circles and Calligrams is solo piano and the other Sixth Jump is a piano trio.    I wouldnt exactly call Steve Lacy obscure but he was around for so long and his discography is insanely deep even though I cant think of any albums that most people think of as canonical classics or whatever. My favorite is Disposability with a sax trio which sounds really prescient to my ears. It certainly doesnt sound like . Epistrophy from  is my favorite of the many Lacy records that consist of Monk covers although More Monk the solo sax record from  is also amazing and very different. The flip side to the cant think of a canonical Lacy record thing although honestly there should be some is that I cant think of a bad one either although some people dont like his wifes weird singing on some of his mid career records I can get down with it.,Jazz,cna7g9a,5,t5_2qmm6

If were talking about soloing you can bust out Eb riffs iiVIs in Eb etc and itll sound great.The general principle is to look for sections of the song where though the chords may change the key is the same. Once you get good at just playing notes in key over that you look for iiVIs and the like to show you how the song breathes  where the tensions and resolutions are within the same key. In a vanilla major key the V chord is usually the tense part and the I is the resolution. If were talking about comping thats a different matter.,Jazz,coa10wn,23,t5_2qmm6

3087081,0,t1_cohbym4,Expanding on this here are some key moments where I think you see the tide turning from exploratory and revolutionary to safe and entertaining for some individual artists and record labels. Note that Im not saying that the later and safer albums wouldnt be good music  on the contrary as it is their success that draws other musicians to move away from experimenting and pushing the limitAfter Bitches Brew Herbie Hancock first goes very deep into murky fusion with Mwandishi but then suddenly emerges with the danceable funkiness of Head Hunters  contrast Sextant  to Head Hunters With Weather Report its a more gradual change but there is definitely an ongoing movement from exploratory to safer grooves. The first Weather Report album  is clearly still very much influenced by Bitches Brew and feels very urgent and dangerous on Mysterious Traveller  smoother sounds have clearly begun to take over. When Pastorius joins the band for Black Market  its almost like a different band.Producer Creed Taylors CTI label scored a big hit with Eumir Deodatos version of Also Sprach Zarathustra  at the time firmly entrenched in pop culture by  Space Odyssey. The commercial success of combining a beat you can dance to with orchestral sounds doesnt go unnoticed and soon disco is born.Blue Note was definitely one of the greatest jazz labels of the s in  Donald Byrds Black Byrd with its new take on electric rampb and jazz fusion becomes the best selling Blue Note album so far. Byrd had been moving in that direction for a couple of years but still its a clear departure from traditional jazz stylings compared to say Electric Byrd Another big seller pointing the way to jazz becoming more suited for light background music than challenging art is Keith Jarretts The Kln Concert  which is highly melodic and easy to listen to certainly a very different mood than for example Fort Yawuh ,Jazz,cohz30n,1,t5_2qmm6

As a sax player I value players ability to insert new melodic lines and navigate the different keys atop the original melodies the absolute original being this an insane example being this If you were to type in all the things you are you would find thousands of renditions from famous players which brings a whole new meaning to the concept of bringing new to the old.I love listening to piano improvisation on a similar principle. If you were to say go play a C chord on the piano or some other basic jazzbased chord derivation you would find a distinct lack of color it would be BORING.

Occasionally she does go up higher for some nice melodies but she will immediately fall back down to where she is most comfortable. When she does sing low it sounds forced or ugly at times compared to her chocolatey smooth voice.Personally thats what I love about her her timbre adds a secret sauce to all of her songs so much so that I prefer her renditions of standards than any other female jazz vocalist.But hey what do I know Im just a teen enjoying summer break writing about Ella Fitzgerald at  in the morning.

In the s Armstrong was his only equal  however sadly Bechet went through a yearslong recording gap while Armstrong was cranking out classics. He was not the first great jazz soloist. King Oliver was assuredly great and was quite a bit older than Bechet. Bechet has great solos on record in  but so does Armstrong Tommy Ladnier Jimmie Noone Johnny Dodds Oliver etc. My favorite Bechet from the s is Kansas City Man Blues New Orleans Hop Scop Blues Texas Moaner Blues with Louis Armstrong and Really the Blues recorded  but in the authentic old style. Check out Coltranes Blues to Bechet  and the modern Bechet acolyte Aurora Nealand I have been considering a Moldy Figs s Jazz Listening Club in this sub to highlight some of these s classics which are tragically overlooked.,Jazz,ctbu2n9,2,t5_2qmm6

There are several reasons for that one of which is that much of jazzdom is like you stuck in a mythologized past. Myself Im kind of glad to see the back of all the analyzing ranking taxonomizing geneaologizing and bloviating about jazz glad theres no ossified public consensus to tell me what I should like or what I should think good music is.

6175891,0,t3_405ews,Milt Buckner was the originator of this style both on Hammond organ and on piano. He called it locked hands and recorded an excellent album of that name Its the keyboard equivalent of big band arrangements where often the melody is played by the instruments both at the top and bottom of a section eg the sax section or trumpets with intervening notes played by the other parts.Typically the right hand plays the melody with the rd th and especially th fingers while the lower fingers of that hand play other parts of the chord. Meanwhile melody is doubled an octave below by the left hand often with embellishments such as chromatic runs or blurs up to the note. For faster passages the locked hands style is sometimes replaced by simple octaving between the two hands.Other comments give good examples of players that use this technique a lot and Ill add Dave Brubeck piano and Wild Bill Davis organ to that list.

The preGinger Fela was equally energetic  AkoFela had his thing down true and for westerners there might be a sameness to the songs but for those who grew up with the music  there is probably more variety in Felas catalog than say Black Sabbath or whatever.  To an African s hard rock is probably the most monotonously narrow and unvaried music imaginable. Its perspective.    Imagine being Asian and hearing jazz as an outsider.

With the emergence of rock amp roll jazz became less accessible to the masses amp morphed into an artistic form much as Serious music with a limited but knowledgeable audience. Thus it stands today unfortunately a geographical consideration weighing heavily upon acceptance amp venues to perform vs literal non existence. Having performed in cities such as Boston NY Philly DC Baltimore Miami LA San Francisco amp others I can safely state jazz is alive and well. Unfortunately if you are an aspiring jazz musician amp not located in an area conducive to the music youd better relocate to a more hip environment.  ,Jazz,czig0xd,1,t5_2qmm6

6809505,0,t1_d0nyc4q,Obviously there are guys who have done similar things before but I dont think you can really compare Kendrick with Freestyle Fellowship or any other artist who has experimented with the music he is playing with. Kendrick is currently one of the most prominent artists in all of music and has basically reached celebrity status. Most of the s jazz rap guys remained completely underground for their entire careers. Tribe and Digable Planets are two exceptions but even then the jazz influence was mostly in sample usage not actual musical forms and neither group reached the point that Kendrick is at right now.TPAB has influenced numerous artists around the world already and the record isnt even a year old. It still remains to be seen what impact hell have on music history but its pretty easy to tell that its gonna be big. Certainly bigger than any jazz rap artist before him.

He was still learning in the teens. Pharoah Sanders is spelled Pharoah not Pharaoh. You spelled the word pharaoh correctly but he spelled it incorrectly. I would take off the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. They were corny. Add Sidney Bechet Jimmie Noone Johnny Dodds.Its Art Blakey not Blakely.Thelonious.Bill Evans was not s bebop. Bud Powell could take his place. Miles was also hard bop and he should be the number one listed under Fusion since he created it. Also list John McLaughlin Tony Williams etc.Hancock.Eric Dolphy gotta be on here somewhere.Its just too hard to do one of these right because theres too much blending or overlapping to neatly place people into categories.,Jazz,d149bha,5,t5_2qmm6

But I truly think there is something to every single type of music. I think this is a jazzinspired mindset... jazz is endlessly eclectic. It has been touched by cultures from every continent on Earth and all those influences are immeasurably important. So I took the jazz mentality as a lesson to have an open mind.

What a fantastic talent and I love that she is eavily featured on this album the official title of the album is Stretch Music Introducing Elena Pinderhughes. I really admire about the direction Christian Scott chose to take with this album and the group to bring on these younger cats Elena and Braxton Cook and I think the whole band really shines from a performance aspect.Also the compositions are so interesting so... relevent now. The way Christian Scott throws in electronic drumnbass type feels hiphipesque production value and layering rock elements... you can tell this guy is checking out everything happening in music right now and trying to use the sounds of the time to express something true and unique.Christians playing has always captivated me. Not only is his language filled with fascinating twirling playful lines he really put himself into the horn. I think hes similar to Miles in that way. Such a unique expressive player I absolutely love him and this album. Ive also gotten a chance to see him live he played a whole set of Black Sababth covers it was incredible and would highly reccommend catching his band if they come through.,Jazz,d40bs7d,23,t5_2qmm6

Theyre generally described as punk jazz a broad and mostly useless term connoting in this case that theyve got the sort of pulse and energy that youd expect from hard rock but they use the instrumentation and exhibit the melodic complexity youd expect from bebop.

8228497,0,t1_d560wk7,American made drums from the ss are much different than what is being massproduced for todays drums. Different combinations of wood plys to make up the drums. Ludwig and Slingerland used ply shells through most of their career. But at least for Slingerland they moved to ply drums with no reinforcement rings.The bearing edges part that the head sits on were also cut differently than the  degree ones of today. Send me a pm and I can get you my email or Facebook if youd like some more info. For cymbals big band drummers such as buddy rich and gene Krupa didnt use many cymbals above the in size. Buddys main setup include a in bounce todays ride in crash hats and a in paper thin splash. Meanwhile today almost every drummer uses a in main ride cymbal. Vintage cymbals sound nothing like todays cymbals something about being handmade and also the dirt and grime build up gives them nice patinas that can change the sound.I dont know every little thing about everything but have a pretty decent knowledge of vintage drums as its what I do. But really I can talk about this forever so get in contact with me!Liatnor,Jazz,d5649tl,12,t5_2qmm6

Heres a cute little tune as an introductionWestern Swing grew quickly by mixing early bluesjazzinfluenced country musicians like Jimmie Rodgers with more Hillybilly dance music like Uncle Dave MaconOne of the most important early groups was the Light Crust Doughboys a group that contained two of the most important Western Swing bandleaders Milton Brown and Bob Wills.Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies were extremely popular throughout the earlymid s until he died in a car accident in . Hes responsible for introducing the pedal steel into country music although Rodgers introduced the steel guitar from Hawaiian vaudeville much earlierThrough his music you can see the format of Western Swing emerging old hot jazz and showtunes mixing big vocals and instrumental improvisation guitar or banjodriven rhythm like in early jazz at least until the drum set arrives in the s.Bob Wills was known as The King. He was the most prolific Western Swing bandleader alongside also playing fiddle and his group The Texas Playboys were the most popular band. Their track San Antonio Rose was a huge hit. His signature was to as bandleader add his own little vocal flair whoops and HAAAAA! and naming his band members even though he didnt usually sing. His main singer Tommy Duncan was perhaps the best Western Swing vocalist of all time. Wills made hundreds of records alongside hours and hours of live radio recordings. The Tiffany Transcriptions are a great place to dig into what Western Swing has to offer.Wills music would prove influential on Rock amp Roll as well. Its said his tune Ida Red was the inspiration for Chuck Berrys Maybellene His younger brother Johnny Lee Wills was also a western swing musician and Johnny Lees Milk Cow Blues was covered by Elvis in one of his first recordings Milkcow Blues BoogieBandleader and fiddler Spade Cooley alongside vocalist Tex Williams was another incredibly instrumental musician in the s. Williams novelty numbers like Smoke Smoke Smoke and Never Trust A Woman are everpopular for their talking blues style.Some lesser known but still enjoyable artists include Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys and Bill Boyd amp His Cowboy RamblersWestern Swing waned in popularity once Hank Williams appeared and Honky Tonk became the more popular style of country music. In todays world of I dont like Country music unless its Johnny Cash Western Swing is mostly forgotten but its influence still exists today.Related interesting musicinfo The Sons of the Pioneers featuring Roy Rogers of restaurant and movie fame were the preeminent Western music group and had a similar sound to many Western Swing groups. This would pave the way for Marty Robbins Gunfighter Ballads which some would call the pinnacle of the Western style. Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys diverged from Western Swing by playing a little harder and faster. They were also known as the first Bluegrass group and also had an influence on Rock amp Roll with Blue Moon of Kentucky appearing on Elvis first single although it wouldnt sound quite right until Flatt and Scruggs left and went their own way. In the late s Hank Thompson started a miniature Western Swing revival. Asleep At The Wheel did the same in the s. Waylon Jennings wrote a song about Wills. Merle Haggard did a whole album. Contemporary country artists will occasionally do throwback tunes.,Jazz,d6v3i2w,3,t5_2qmm6

The barisax intros set the tone for both pieces but they are done completely differently. The bari in the MBB cover comes out brash and charismatic and the piece quickly hits a fever pitch which is exactly what I loved about it the first time I heard it. In the BampR version however the bari starts out almost hesitantly brooding with the backgrounds beckoning it to come out gradually drawing it out and gathering momentum.

It can help you get into and explore different headspaces which can inspire your work.  It can also make you believe youre playing better than you are.Poverty also strongly correlates to drug use.

9375362,0,t3_58yexn,With the caveat that there are few rigid walls between art forms that everything bleeds into each other so what can be said about one might be true about the other. Blues and jazz started about the same time the turn of the th century. Both are forms of black music but blues started in rural pockets around the Deep South. Jazz is more a blend of several kinds of music Caribbean French ragtime and some blues too that came together in New Orleans and grew to other cities like Chicago so its often seen as more cosmopolitan.Musically blues is quite simple. It uses few chords that are played kind of repetitively almost predictably but with the predictability also comes catchy earworm melodies. It doesnt take a lot of mastery to be able to play the blues. Jazz musicians are very skilled and the music is noted for its complexity and how it allows for individual musicians to improvise in ways that tend to be more complicated than blues.Thematically blues focuses on misery or fooling around. Blues was the expression or subversion of black pain in a very unjust society. It features a lot of howling crying or screaming... very emotional delivery. It tends to focus on bad relationships or scandal. The first wave of blues was popularized by women on stage Bessie Smith Ma Rainey who sang about really bawdy stuff. In contrast jazz started out as upbeat party music but also a subversion of black pain because theres no time to be miserable when youre partying your ass off.Blues progressed from women singing on stage to men with acoustic guitars Charley Patton Son House during the Great Depression and the guitar became the predominant instrument for blues but piano and harmonica can also be lead instruments. The simple chords of blues also got incorporated into black gospel and country music. Electric guitars brought on a new stage of blues that got really popular in Chicago Chess Records and Detroit because millions of black people moved from rural places in Mississippi and Alabama to the North because it sucked for black people in these places. But blues remained a niche for black people until about  and was never very respectable. As in you couldnt really become super famous as a blues musician.Jazz became wildly popular in the s  far more popular than blues. Jazz spread all over the world. It started with hot jazz artists like Jelly Roll Morton Bix Beiderbecke and most of all Louis Armstrong. Lead instruments were usually brass or woodwind like cornet saxophone or clarinet. Jazz adapted to become swing music in the late s Benny Goodman Duke Ellington with enormous bands and dominated popular music which you can hear in film soundtracks and old radio broadcasts. By the s jazz lost its danceable aspect when it became modern or bebop jazz and turned into a subversion of popular music itself using chords and rhythms that were unpredictable almost chaotic if you didnt understand what you were hearing and most people didnt. It lost a lot of its popularity but attracted intellectual fans who appreciated it for what it was trying to achieve.As jazz lost its danceability rock and roll got popular. Some of the really early rock songs turned some listeners to jazz because they were so simple think Be Bop A Lula by Gene Vincent amp the Blue Caps. The struggle of black blues musicians resonated strongly with listeners in the UK who had not been very exposed to such emotional music before. Instead of race being the focus of injustice British listeners understood the misery because they had a rigid class system that kept poor people impoverished. British people fucking LOVED the blues and basically took it over. They worshipped the guitar players of the s and s restarting some artists careers like Howlin Wolf and John Lee Hooker. Blues became rock and roll the voice of youth while jazz remained more laid back geared more toward adults.,Jazz,d94e6et,8,t5_2qmm6

The story goes and somehow the hero cant write music anymore but he will eventually find new inspiration or overcoming psichological issues by experiencing some meaningful life stuff romance drama revelation ... you name it and he wins the game of music.Thats why people think being a musician is not a real job or doesnt really requires a lot of effort when you have the right ammount of talent.Thing is the life of a musician is nothing like that musicians sits for countless hours studying and practicing sweating and working out skills and proficiency talent does not come from nowhere but its rather build over time.Musicians gets shitty pay and super expensive gear and only an incredibly small percentage of them ends up getting a life out of music.Whiplash describes that very well if you cut out the final concert part thats the part when everything turns into a sweet unbearable ending,Jazz,da9xfkz,1,t5_2qmm6
