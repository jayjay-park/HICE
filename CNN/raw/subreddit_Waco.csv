995443,0,t3_25fg6t,Id always entertained the idea of fostering pets but after seeing all the horrible google reviews on this place I dont think I will.... I cant afford the apparent mountain of vet bills and disease that all those people talk about.  I would be devastated if I lost one of my current pets to a disease brought home by a foster pet.   Sorry... I realize that most of those reviews are very old and could no longer be valid but thats just not a risk I want to take.  If conditions are better now maybe you guys should ask for reviews from successful adoptions...,Waco,chhftdz,4,t5_2rxyf

3878298,0,t3_32dj3s,Wow I didnt realize Kuma had closed down already. I moved from Waco at the beginning of the year and didnt know this. I belive the owners of Kuma were the same owners from Muddle. The Kuma staff wasnt the greatest. There were some people that worked there that were descent and cared about their job. Before Kuma opened one of the employees was going around all restaurantsbusinesses on or around Austin Ave taking employees from everyone around them.,Waco,cqycyel,1,t5_2rxyf

Find activities that interest you and hopefully youll make friends from all over Waco!Also this is a super Baylor thing to say but if you are the churchgoing type its a great way to meet people and get involved in the community.Welcome to Waco!,Waco,cuuhyq0,1,t5_2rxyf

6300544,0,t1_cz5n2s1,Fascinating. It looks like you put your finger in exactly the right spot. In fact it seems like the compound site and the ranch are on adjacent properties. I really hadnt been looking at alternative uses of ranch space to include religious noncommercial but I feel like this particular detail might be worth exploring some more if I can find any property transfer agreements between Shelton and other parties. My record digging had mainly turned up a connection to oil and the Shelton ranch specifically a Tudor Oil Company well Shelton No.  located onefourth mile northeast of Axtell that I thought might be related. I still havent pinpointed the well location yet.Source ,Waco,cz5stwo,2,t5_2rxyf
