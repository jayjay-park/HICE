5648825,0,t3_3shozl,The CFL fan in question was I.Last Friday I was threatened with arrest for trespassing for refusing to keep off the mask I have been wearing to CFL games across Canada for YEARS.  I want to make clear that I was in no way misbehaving swearing or demonstrating lewd behaviour.The full backstoryexplanation is here Just the video is here Rogers Centre has a policy against anyone wearing a full face mask I take issue with that particular definition of my mask.  I would later find out that this is because any mask impedes their facial recognition software.  There is no compromise on this policy as they need to see your face at all times.The whole incident was rather farcical and I encourage you to watch the video and read my explanation of the incident with its backstory on my blog.  Im not trying to twist the facts to make myself out like some kind horrible victim of policeRogers brutality thats not the what I want you to take away from this.The issue I want to make everyone aware of is the changing policies stadiums are taking towards the costumes and identities so many of us die hard CFL fans take great pride in.  Yes I know there are no more Argos games at Rogers Centre but BMO has a similar policy stating masks are only allowed to be worn in seats and must be taken off at all other times.Grey Cup  is at BMO Field next year.  Will they be harassing the CFLs bread and butter next November while they line up for the bathroom?What about other venues across the league?  Im fine with taking my mask off to show my identity for whatever reason Ill even let security take my picture and photocopy my license.  However I take great issue with being told I can no longer dress a certain way and express myself as a fan just so a computer can log my face.Does anyone else have a problem with this or am I just being petulant?,CFL,cwxai8l,11,t5_2qiwn

After watching a couple games I realized that i had no team to root for so i started to research the different teams and look at their players. Being the die hard Green Bay Packers fan that I am I started by looking at the team wearing green and gold. I explored Edmontons roster and saw that the Eskimos starting QB was on the Packers practice squad a couple of years ago so that was the first thing that drew me a little closer to becoming an Edmonton fan. I kept scrolling down the page looking for a sign that would tell me i NEEDED to be an Eskimos fan and then I saw it the most obvious sign from the football gods that i was MEANT be an Edmonton Eskimos fan the name of the starting RB John White and i share a the same name. Now i know that John White isnt really an uncommon name but it was enough for me. Ever since that magical moment i have worn my Eskimos fanhood with pride,CFL,d1ir6t0,1,t5_2qiwn

7351792,0,t3_4g0c8p,Major story lines in the Eastern DivisionToronto The Toronto Argonauts are at a critical juncture in their teams history. Falling interest and revenues in Canadas biggest city have left the CFL a shadow of what it once in this major market but theres reason for huge optimism. The team was sold last year to an ownership group that includes Bell which is the owner of TSN  Canadas ESPN and the sole broadcaster of CFL in Canada and on top of that they are moving from the skydome which was garbage for football into BMO field which is a natural grass outdoor stadium used currently by TFC in major league soccer. These factors plus a promise of tail gating at the new stadium Canada has wacky liquor laws that prohibits any public drink except in certain circumstances such as hopefully BMO fields parking lot are expected to boost interest in the team and league. The team has their franchise quarterback Ricky Ray returning after  seasons being injured and the Grey Cup is also in Toronto this year so watch for the Argos to make a major push for the championship.Hamilton I would say this is the Tigercats year but lets be honest every year since  should have been their year. Theyve made it to the big game a couple times but fell just short. Their quarterback Zach Collaros was injured late last year which really hurt their playoff hopes... they were defeated by the Ottawa Redbacks in the eastern final after a close game. Their head coach and general manager Kent Austin is arguably a football genius and year after year has put together championship teams. The Ticats are hungry so watch out.Montreal Oh boy this is tough one. Their GM Jim Popp took over coaching duties late last season after firing the coach during a lack lustre season. Their hall of fame former  quarterback Anthony Calvillo is taking an active role in coaching and coordinating this season so things may improve. Duron Carter son of NFL great Chris Carter has returned as a receiver for the team plus SJ Green Fred Stamps and Nik Lewis ? who are all CFL greats are on board. The Als are looking good for guys who can catch the ball the big question is who can throw it. Currently it looks like long time CFL vet Kevin Glenn will have the start to begin the year but who is the long term solution? Rakeem Cato looked great for a rookie right out of NCAA but Jonathan Crompton is more experienced. Its tough to tell what kind of season Quebecs team will have.OTTAWA The REDBLACKS are coming off a loss in the Grey Cup final to the Edmonton Eskimos but as an outside observer it can hardly be called heartbreaking. The team started with a brutal first season with  wins as an expansion team in  and made it to the final game the next year which just goes to show anything can happen in the CFL. Their quarterback who is a long time veteran of the CFL Henry Burris is looking at his last few seasons in the league so he will be hungry to go out with a bang. Plus they signed Torontos ex starting quarterback Trevor Harris as a backup during the off season. The Redbacks are looking to build consistency however major losses in their defence could hamper that.Ill write up the western teams asap my thumbs hurt though. By the way this is all just my personal perspective.,CFL,d2duk5c,6,t5_2qiwn

But At the end of the day the offense scored  points. They did their job they put a winning amount of points on the board and than some. The fact that our defense let  points past them in what is now  consecutive home games is pathetic.  Ticats get a good chunk of credit Tasker looked like the best possession reviever in the league but it is becoming increasingly clear that Edmonton is losing these games off the backs of their incredibly inept secondary more so then the opposing teams are winning them.

11002551,0,t1_deel4or,I dont know how any football fan can say it wasnt a good game. As a Stamps fan the result hurt but the game was great. It was dramatic as fuck and had great storylines the veteran QB with a chip on his shoulder vs his old team and the young upstart with the incredible win  a championship game that goes to overtime. It was an intense game that kept me glued to my seat there were few controversial calls by the ref just a whole lot of good football. The fact that my team lost is a different question entirely.,CFL,def3v80,4,t5_2qiwn

11570045,0,t3_650nt7,This is awesome. Im only a casual BC Lions fan but I love Grey Cup when it comes to town. Got to meet and hang out with this guy during one of the recent visits that Grey Cup Week landed in Vancouver and he was still at the helm. This guy was amazing. Salt of the earth kindness listened and talked with interest to anyone in the room and just not a lot of bullshit. Really pushed that they were working hard to keep the league healthy and wasnt afraid to tackle any question even the ridiculous ones with complete sincerity. Spent maybe an hour and a half hanging out and approaching people to shake their hand and introduce himself. When he was leaving so many people were inviting him to their various nonofficial parties and hed say something to the effect that he was totally booked up for that day but if it was tomorrow hed totally be there. Maybe that was just bullshit but everyone in the room loved that genuineness from him that I totally believe that hed show up at your hotel room party if he had the time. My only frame of reference prior to this in terms of meeting sports league commissioners was Gary Bettman. NOT SIMILAR AT ALL. ,CFL,dg7gxup,6,t5_2qiwn
