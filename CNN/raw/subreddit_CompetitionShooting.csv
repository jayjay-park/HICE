The JM has some kind of coating which appears to be PTFE to me. Im hoping that helps.Have you tried Briley chokes with any success? Ill have to see how mine behaves with slugs but I think Ill try a Briley IC choke as my first step if I experience any troubles.I definitely will do regarding gas system cleanliness.

If I were you I would just show up with what you have and run it for training and practice with what you might one day depend your life on. The second question comes from the fact that many people realize that this game isnt for them AFTER they have dumped thousands of dollars on different guns and equipment. Also you can just borrow peoples equipment to try out. They USPSA crowd is the nicest group of people I have ever been a part of. TLDR Show up with your duty rig and shoot it for a bit.

If youre fine with adding your own magwell and putting skate tape on in place of the front strap checkering the Springfield Loaded Stainless will fit your budget. Maybe hunt around and see if you can get a used . Trojan for k though? Miracles do happen sometimes.Edit looks like Sig has a stainless target model for ish.
