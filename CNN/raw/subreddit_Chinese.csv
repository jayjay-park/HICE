1362623,0,t1_cin0jpw,I think one can be excused for not knowing that Classical Chinese is appropriate here. gt A quick look at Wikipedia has it that the grammar and syntax differ in Classical but what of the characters?I dont think this is the right question to be asking. To address the issue of characters its erroneous to equate or associate characters to a specific language. That is Chinese characters either Traditional or Simplified are a writing system just as the Latin alphabet Devanagari or Cyrillic are writing systems which are applied in different ways orthography by the languages that use them. That is to say Classical Chinese and Mandarin both draw from the same set of characters but the frequency of the characters being used depends on the vocabulary and grammar of the language in question.To answer the question though because Simplified characters a writing system as we know it today was only standardized in China in the latter half of the th century its probably safe to say that the Classical Chinese text in question would be written in Traditional characters.,Chinese,cin3ejo,1,t5_2qilf
