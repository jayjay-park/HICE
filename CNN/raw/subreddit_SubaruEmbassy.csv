10892205,0,t3_5vjn6n,Few questions from a new ambassador. How do you know that the next batch is one month away do new items come out every time our budget is refreshed? Would it be wise to hold out on ordering until the new batch is released or would that be a waste of funds? What items do you find to be the biggest hits? Thanks!,SubaruEmbassy,de3gcef,1,t5_3gmhy
