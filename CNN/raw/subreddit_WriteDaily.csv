139019,0,t3_1vnqjy,There is no art without suffering.  Thats a lie.  An easy one.  Everyone suffers and our vanity makes it easy to see our trivial nothings as epic expressions of the human experience penned in blood across the invisible fabric of the cosmos.  We like to think that our suffering matters makes us matter.  To the small mind everything is huge but to the incomprehensible infinite internal that is existence the greatest human mind is not even a mote.  We toil and wring our hands and create false gods to hear our pleas.  We see depths of meaning in the arbitrary chemical reaction we call love.  No one can understand true suffering true pain true joy true love true redemption truth until they have stood here on this rubberized mat behind this stainless steel counter polished to a greasy sheen.  No one has known art unless they have suffered the noble calling of the sandwich artist staring daily into the churning gaping maw of the pedestrian hordes stuffing their gullets with chicken chunks meatball marinara and the oblivion that mindless herds deserve.  They would call me a hero if they only knew what I suffered.  The truly great artists philosophers and lovers are never appreciated in their own time.,WriteDaily,ceu9iq0,2,t5_2t0bd
