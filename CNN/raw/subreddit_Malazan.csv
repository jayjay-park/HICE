154299,0,t3_1vuew1,Yes! I am very pleased that there is no apparent sexism in these books since I find it very offputting and am very easily offended by it. I like the fact that Erikson gives his female characters active and important roles in the story and they are not showed as inferior. This is another reason to love this series.,Malazan,cew088x,4,t5_2t1dv
230272,0,t1_cf4kxil,Yes the orcs and elves comparison is really blunt. But Im finding the series hard to describe to people as is!The Tlan Imass was always prehumans to me. They are older and it paints a fascinating picture of what if Neanderthals lived parallel to Homo sapiens today albeit undead. Also wasnt it revealed in MoI that the Barghast is another evolution as well?Didnt think about Lether vs. Edur in that way! I was thinking more about their traditions behaviors and environment. But on a more abstract level of course! Worshippers of money ambition and an empty throne great imagery! vs geographically bound spiritual tribes. ,Malazan,cf4m63w,0,t5_2t1dv

832419,0,t3_23nsc6,Theres no need to call yourself a filthy filthy casual in this subreddit. People here are generally relaxed whether youre a new reader or longterm fan.My personal take on your question the stories of the books are selfcontaining but there are multiple overarching storylines throughout the series. So while the former part would suit your available time the latter might be a bit more complicated. Maybe it makes sense to keep short notes. In all fairness Erikson always has this Dramatis Personae segment at the beginning of the book that will help a bit but its nowhere near enough. I guess it all depends on your memory and recollection.,Malazan,cgywcp3,7,t5_2t1dv

880539,0,t1_ch48mlw,Rotting ice has nothing to do with anything in the ice which is why the imagery is frustrating to me.  It simply refers to ice that has been exposed for a long time and has become wet and brittle.  I instinctively imagine it to have some sort of rotting organic material in it but that isnt what it usually is describing.

There were a couple of things I thought were drab and predictable but ultimately I enjoyed the read.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.Next up is either House of Chains or the beginning of a Kingkiller reread.  I cant decide yet.

3132012,0,t3_2vzrby,Im a bit shy here because I dont know at what point you are in book one I assume but here are my two grainsIt was all pretty confusing at first but I knew I was in for a treat at that whole Paran meets Lorn in a ground littered with chewed up bodies. And horses. Goddammit horses. But its only the beginning yet and you feel quite overwhelmed  or suffocated  by the sheer amount of stuff going one. Then I met Kruppe. Then I met Rake. By then I was all ok this is cool but still overwhelmed. I often read two or three books at a time and I confess I used to spend  days reading the others before going back. It was then that I read a interview with Erickson where he goes about compassion as being a major theme on his books and something clicked inside of me.From that point onward I was aware of a constant tune an intermittent note that always made me go back to the book. I mean there are lots of good stuff in there lots of awesomeness but theres this deep connection I felt but wasnt really conscious about. Its a subjective thing but keep on tracks. If youre anything like me in this regard youll savor and cherish these characters development. If I may give you an advice muffle down the confusion and bewilderment and attune yourself to the other sentiments the writing draws on you. ,Malazan,commq8k,5,t5_2t1dv
3133466,0,t3_2vzrby,I got hooked later than most currently reading MoI and what really made everything click and get me excited were two characters introduced in DG names from DGs Mappo and Icarium.

3278888,0,t3_2xo3ed,This is actually the exact thing I did except I powered through WoT in  months. I will warn you. WoT is an extremely deep and wonderful world but Jordan eases you into it. Erikson is going to shove you into the thrashing maelstrom that is the Malazan world and expect you to swim or drown. So Ill give you a few points thatll help the transition.You will be confused. The world is much more complicated. Power through and things will be slowly explained.Everything is connected. Any odd little tangents or side characters are important to the overall arc of the series even if its  books laterIts darker and less clear. Wheel of Time at its core is still a standard good versus evil story. The line is clear between the forces of the Dark One and the good guys. Malazan has no such lines. You will often see both sides of a conflict in Midnight Tides especially and like characters on both sides. There are few characters that can be considered good or evil in truth.Erikson will take your feelings mold them into something beautiful and then stomp them into the ground with cleats. Be prepared to be so angry youll want to throw your book at the wall. Be prepared to laugh so hard youll wake other people up.

5161075,0,t1_cv7xgyi,Well you said you dont care about spoilers so here we go. The Tlan Imass were from what I gather basically something like Neanderthal as we know it way back in the day. That whole thing with them and the Jaghut tyrants kicked off they got their asses kicked and decided that the only way to ensure the extinction of the Jaghut Tyrants of the day was through their ritual. The Ritual is what made them as they are today undead husks with a few exceptions who are obsessed with destroying everything last remnant of the Jaghut so that the ritual will be broken and they can finally rest. They are shells of their firmer selves and have given up all vestiges of humanity in their hateful and blind pursuit of all Jaghut in the world.So they are immortal and they were human once well a forerunner of the modern malaz human but through the millennia they have been reduced by living as undead for so long.

Why do they even care?This is a central question of the series why do gods care about their worshipers and what happens when the ideas of the gods and their worshipers conflict?

6127033,0,t3_3zh0lj,I just have one tip for you while reading them. Dont skim. You can make it though many books just by lightly reading and skipping over some stuff.  Do not do that with these. Things that seem like throw away details may be hugely important to the story  and Erikson is not going to reiterate it just before it becomes relevant to make sure you understand what is going on. It is a very rewarding series if you can do this. There will be so many AH HA!  moments that will be very fulfilling as you read. Thats part off what made me love the series so much. ETA without spoiling anything For example   there is one scenelocation that you see multiple times  over multiple books from multiple points of view. Erikson never goes hey remember this!  Hint hint  the story just rolls on making no real indication that youve been here before... But when it hits you what you are seeing  and start to piece together what took place and how  it is very satisfying.  If you skim through and dont pay attention you will miss out on stuff like this. ,Malazan,cym2w1j,12,t5_2t1dv

6418639,0,t3_43lx0f,The obvious one is Karsa his entire character is a mindless barbarian tropebreaker and of all the characters in Malazan he is one that changes the most. Witness! One of my other favorites is the demons. In Malazan demons have their own societies cultures ways of life. Some arent even violent just trying to live their lives when through some inexplicable reason spells uttered by mages enable them to be controlled and pulled into a strange world from their Warren and forced to do strange bipedal creatures bidding. It makes me wonder if the opposite can happen can a demon sorcerer summon a human to their Warren with the proper spells if technically they are both just regular beings of their respective material plane. Another is the Jaghut who are clearly based off of orcs or trolls which are typically stupid many homogenous creatures but in Malazan they are drywitted loners who can do great magic. The undead zombies of the TLan Imass are not plodding mindless monsters but a complex society with various tribes. The elflike Titse species are depressed moody and not at all nature loving in their nature or magic Darkness being their origin. Sometimes elves are racist in certain universes so the Liosan are a bit of a trope as we never see them really as individuals that I remember they just hate everybody not themselves. The Malazans allow their regular soldiers to think for themselves and are not just a faceless army with the captains and Fists being the main characters. Most of the gods are definitely not all knowing all powerful or all wise. They are more like the Greek gods infallible everyday people with great powers rather than otherworldly metaphorical concepts. Burn excluded. ,Malazan,czj82c4,17,t5_2t1dv

6732764,0,t3_47th9q,I somewhat frequently found myself paging back through the book or with the later ones even going back to previous books to find and reread certain scenes. It was helpful to jog my memory answer questions clarify ambiguous statements etc. Thats not so easy to do with audio and its even easier to miss those little scenes in the first place.For most books I generally think audio is a fine medium but in my opinion the Malazan series is too dense. It probably would be perfectly enjoyable on audio but it really rewards careful reading and you almost definitely wouldnt be getting the full experience. You might find yourself even more turned off of the series if you miss important or minor but flavorful things due to the medium.EDIT spelling is hard.EDIT the second Forgot to say if you just want to power through the first book having decided you dont want to read it go for it. I would strongly suggest not relying on audio for the rest of the series though.,Malazan,d0fq61j,1,t5_2t1dv

I took it as him exploring the Warrens and learning about his new job. So he is now acting with knowledge which obviously would make him a far more confident character. He wasnt exactly shy before that either... antagonising the head of the Claw whilst being alone with the guy in the Imperial Warren?

6786142,0,t3_48phth,Alright its been a while since I have read the series but Ill try and explain my opinion on all of the issues youve brought up. First you mention earning the use of rape in his series in your closing paragraph which I really do not get. Rape is terrible yes but so is murder and I really dont see you protesting the use of murder and war in his series especially the murder and horrible deaths of children. Rape happens in real life just like murder does which is why Erikson writes it into his books. People do  terrible terrible things and Erikson writes it to be truthful to humanity. Nor is he overexplicit with the rape happening in his books he is certainly not a creep about sex. You also mention that you think Erikson overuses rape when in  books approximately  pages and a ridiculous amount of content you have mentioned six correct me if Im wrong incidents of rape and even some of those are borderline not rape in your opinion. I think they might stand out more to you just because it seems like a really really big issue to you even more so than all of the other varied and many crimes against humanity described in the books We are not talking about modern Western cultures that posses modern views on women. We are talking about ancient cultures medieval at best that had entirely different views on women sex and rape. Erikson knows this hes a trained anthropologist who no doubt has tons of experience learning about different cultures. All of the issues you have with rape in the series are about how justified they are in context to the plot and characters. Rape happens in this series because rape happens to people. Its a horrible thing but Erikson does not use it lightly. Women in places torn apart by war and strife especially are vulnerable to rape and almost the entire series takes part in the middle of several separate wars. I might add on more to this later and sorry for the wall of text!,Malazan,d0lhvne,3,t5_2t1dv

7068319,0,t3_4cem36,I feel like they arent really comparable. Most Asoiaf characters are rather archetypical and onedimensional but very thoroughly fleshed out. Every character basically has a minute by minute timeline that shows what theyve done throughout the years for all relevant timelines. Their reactions are often predictable but the fact that the game has so many significant influential players makes it a good thing. The amount of different players makes the world interesting.Malazan characters are nearly universally unpredictable. Archetypes are being messed with most notably Karsa and are all over the place. Large parts of their backstories before the books are completely glossed over in a few sentences and the timeline doesnt make sense at all. Basically there arent many big factions but the ones there are consist of great characters that make their own little place in the world while not being particularly influential when it comes to the overarching plotlines.Asoiaf would a mess when the players were as unpredictable and crazy as the players in Malazan and Malazan would be boring if the characters were as typical as most are in Asoiaf.Theres no better or worse they fit the world each writer has meant to build. ,Malazan,d1hk1jn,17,t5_2t1dv

But on my second read it struck me her story is so sad.... parents dead brother dead betrayed by her sister losing everything she holds dear mercilessly raped on the prison ship... herded with two grotesque companions one of whom is a confirmed murderer... it would be the height of unrealistic cruel expectation to assume that she will function normally later. She could have committed suicide in fact suicide would be a common response in this situation but she chooses a different form of self destruction and yet uses that to try and help out Heboric a bit. To me she is easily one of the saddest most tragic characters of the series and deserves our empathy. ,Malazan,d1m1cl0,16,t5_2t1dv

7278526,0,t3_4f1ue2,Oh boy. I think I understood a lot of that when I first finished the book but now that Im on Dust of Dreams Ive forgotten a lot of this. Ill try to answer some as best I can but I do believe theres just a good amount of RAFO as well as simply not knowingI dont think we really know but then again we dont know how plenty of Ascendants got their fame. I always just assumed he did a lot of amazing things. His name was well known so I suppose whether intentionally or not he established a larger and larger following over time.Yes I believe Soletaken are immortal. Not  sure but everything Ive read about them would certainly suggest so.I honestly didnt remember who Buke was until I looked him up. I assume he went on to do other stuff.... or maybe he eventually drank himself to death. Really not sure.Theyre on another continent so maybe the pull wasnt strong enough to reach them. Maybe they were smart enough to know that it would be too dangerous for them. Maybe they were doing other things.I dont know who the King is but I dont think all spots need to be filled at all times. Thats just an assumption though I dont think its ever stated one way or another.Hard to say on the dream world. Im guessing that it would go away. Not  sure though. To be honest the Mhybe stuff kind of annoyed me so I probably paid less attention than I should have.I think it meant that they could choose to die. If I recall though they decided that they had to help their own kind off in another part of the world so they didnt end up moving on yet. Think of it as a great weight being lifted from an entire race though. Imagine you have this thing in your life causing constant grief and its suddenly just taken away. Tool was made mortal by Togg not by Itkovian.The Jaghut werent extinct theres just not very many of them. However theyre immortal and the Imass were not. Theres a lot of RAFO here.Yes there definitely was a hint of romance between them.I dont remember this at all. Keep in mind that if a mage doesnt have wards up and is caught unaware Im just guessing on the circumstances because I really dont remember this they can be taken down just as easily as anyone else.Kallor is human. A ton of RAFO and stuff that I dont know yet and dont want to search to avoid my own spoilers. His alchemy helps combat the effects of ageing the curse is what made him immortal. Mortals can take spots in the High Houses. As to his motivations for doing anything well... Kallor does what he wants. Hes lived for a very long time so I imagine he likes to keep things interesting. Nightchill may have been part of it but really it just happened to be where he was at the time. Its sad to say but in the grand history of his life this betrayal was just one of what is likely hundreds if not thousands. He does what he wants and hes good at surviving. When youre mortal betraying someone is going to leave a sting for the rest of their life. When youre immortal you can probably wait a few centuries and by then and what you did wont really matter all that much in the big picture. Sorry for the overly long answer but to put it lightly Kallor is a complicated guy.Im not really sure about his race. It might be RAFO.GotM was written about  years before the next book in the series. There are some character inconsistencies and Tayschrenn is probably the biggest of them. I know its not a very satisfying answer but I believe thats the main reason for the different portrayal.To varying degrees the Elder Gods have waned in power. I think Nightchill spent so much time in mortal bodies she eventually was weakened to just a High Mage. Also some beings are just strongerweaker than others.TarthenalToblakai already answered this.RAFO on Gruntle.I dont think we really know. Some might be RAFO but the souls of Quick Ben are a bit of a mystery at least as far as Ive gotten.Shadowthrone doesnt want to draw too much attention to himself. Controlling both Shadow and the First Throne would put a rather huge target on his back. He left the First Throne after he ascended and I believe that was by choice.While dialog makes it seem like the alliance is going quite smoothly you have to remember that the Malazans arent actually outlawed so this could have dire consequences if they dont establish a decent foothold further into the continent. Anyway I tried to answer them all but a lot are pretty murky for me. Hope it helped a bit.,Malazan,d25iq2k,3,t5_2t1dv

7757902,0,t3_4lkfk3,I must give you kudos for what you are doing here going through each book and blogging like this. It is going to be a labor of love I hope for you. Knowing what you are going to experience and being right along with you I can already tell it will be a fun time!The confusion you feel is normal to a greater or lesser degree at this point. I know I was at first. Erikson wrote this nine years before the second book and it was his first novel and it shows a bit.  It drops you in with little backstory and you have to sink or swim at first figure out who everything connects with through the characters POV and plot and Erikson doesent spoonfeed you he trusts you to figure it out on your own as you read. There is a large amount of introspective philosophy which I enjoy but some find it to be to much.  A large part of the greatness of Malazan is the AH HAH! moments as you connect plot points and events in a book sometimes between books. The books usually start out slow characters plot world building then in the last third it all comes together and usually leaves you an epic weepy mess breathless with what you just read at  in the morning because you couldnt stop. It was hard at first there is a LOT in this book but the world building and the craziness of scope and scale carried me through and it becomes much tighter in the subsequent books and all the first novelisms of Erikson goes away. If you dont understand something just ask here but the most important thing to remember this early on is its okay to not understand something and that it WILL most likely be explained later in the book. Rule  for Malazan is Keep Reading.Given how you are meticulously reading this so that you may write about it later I bet youll be fine. I look forward to your posts! We looooove experiences from new readers. And also were not crazed fanpeople here criticisms of Malazan are just fine as well. Malazan is NOT perfect. No series is.

8120959,0,t1_d4qgf2a,my takeaway was  If I remember correctly I believe the warrens were still accessible in seven cities continent its been a while but it was just too dangerous or tricky to do so at that time because of all the shapeshifters converging in the area.     gtwill there be a way that both of these scenarios fit together.  well things definitely become clearer later. I guess rafo and let the clues slowly come to you  warning it will take several books.  gtOr was it simply that the shapeshifters can resist the CGs   infection?      I dont feel like is was because of being attracted to the CGs stuff but more out there for their own personal goals that are becoming available in that area.       gtOr does it have to do were in the actual world you are standing for the warrens to be affected?  Like if Im in Seven Cities   the poison doesnt get here because its only at Genabackis.         This kinda gets clears up later too but my takeaway is no matter where you access the warren from that warren is still poisoned.  However opening up a warren or drawing from a warren in certain specific places can be hard.  Like you definitely cant access a warren on Otatataral Island but in Durujhistan it would be no problem.  Youd probably have trouble accessing a warren around all the Whirlwind shenanigans or other magic heavy events but you wouldnt have a problem accessing it at Pale. ,Malazan,d4sva3d,2,t5_2t1dv

Omtose Phellack was manifested by Hood as an attempt to weaken the FA warren and thereby their power. . I dont know how Heboric took hold of Korabas. I think it has something to do with how he has otataral and jade hands. . Read Blood and Bone. My take is that Tiam is a manifestation of the innate Elient warren similar to Black Coral but much much worse. . Ganoes became master of the deck in MOI I believe. He does struggle with it several times from his perspective. . The Deck is a way to read what powerful beings are active here and now. To me every god and most ascendants have respective cards and when they are active in a region talents can see that in the Deck. As for how that works I dont know. Nor do I think its stated. ,Malazan,d547zwx,1,t5_2t1dv

It feels a lot like a scientific article on a historical sociological and psychological level. Dense fancy words and it can feel incredibly tiresome. I completed the series when the last book came out and read it all over again last year and Im accustomed to academical texts. It felt like an academical text. GotM that is. It tries to tell you a lot of things specific things that only the author assumes you have an interest in knowing. In a sense its like the author tries to explain you high level physics when youre still in high school. I loved GotM so much because its the most concise book of them all. It does a dont tell just show kind of thing as much as it can and still fucks with you. So basically its the most academic book of them all and I love the book for what it is. It tells you how things are and leaves you to figure it out. So basically an academic text on a world the academic text that continues later that you cant help but love ,Malazan,d68d989,1,t5_2t1dv
8541972,0,t3_4wm9fi,I personally suggest Brandon Sanderson. He is my favorite author by far. Yes he does write more for teen fantasy. But his style and writing are out of this world. He has some of the most thought out and planned magic systems that he will write a chart for you to follow they are that planned out.  Especially once you realize things that are going on in the background of his stories and take a few reads to find out.  I dont want to spoil it once I realized everything I was literally speechless for like  mins. I would suggest starting out with the Mistborn trilogy. As that is the easiest introduction to his work and if you like that you will probably like the rest of his stuff. If your brave and want to start a series after only  and you arent daunted by  page books. His epic fantasy series he is writing The Stormlight Archive. Way of kings is the first book is absolutely fantastic. If you dont mind the little details I mentioned above this series is grade a gold. Cant say enough about it. Read both books twice and want to re read them again. There is so much more I can say but it will ruin the discovery for yourself.

9097556,0,t3_54vo1o,Theres definitely more information going forward but I would say that the exact definition of a god and an ascendant and the difference between the two is left pretty vague deliberately. There are many paths to ascendancy as someone once said.FWIW heres the definition from the Malazan wikigtAscendants were individuals who had transcended death. They formerly had been called First Heroes. Ascendants could become gods if they gained sufficient following among mortals but they were not gods by default. They were more or less immortal but could be killed. They had access to magic even if they were not mages prior to their ascension.As to how Kallor was able to destroy his entire Empire while also cursing Elder Gods well I too have always wondered how he was so powerful back then when basically a normal human...  Maybe someone else can help with that.

10412221,0,t3_5p47pb,This going to sound a little weird but I compare Eriksons writing of most of his endless supply of side characters characters to how James Cameron writes the Marine characters in Aliens. He has to make you care about them enough in  min opening intro sequence and subsequent deeds throughout the movie that when they die you feel bad. This makes the movie better because you have associated emotion with it happy or sad feelings. The more in depth characters and there are only a few Ripley Bishop Newt Hicks maaaybe Burke are given more indepth characterization. Erikson excels at making you care about a character in just a few pages Beak Harlo etc the endless Marines who get just a few pages or lines of dialogue here and there in short sequences and he writes his indepth characters with enough brevity and wit heart and soul so that even if they dont go to deep into their past and they dont talk about themselves much it happens but theres nothing like the revealing Jaime and Brienne in the pool scene conversation between Kalam and Quick Ben for example  you remember them for their deeds and actions and dialogue which reveals their characterization.

10787257,0,t1_ddsj88t,Quick thing to specify the implication is that Tamber was the Eresal in a similar way that Sorry was Cotillion. Tamber was presumably normal human at some point. The earliest thing we know about her was that she used to be a concubine in a temple for the Queen of Dreams in Unta. Maybe that was before the Eresal used her. Eresal does certainly have a sexual theme to her.As it often is we dont know what Tavore knew. Though theres actually reason to believe that she doesnt know that what Tamber was at least the specifics. After Tamber dies the only people who see the eresal rise out of Tambers corpse is Grub and Lostara. Grub tells her that she can never tell Tavore. It adds to the themes of Lostara knowing these secret truths of the people closest to her. Would be a bit silly if Tavore knew the whole time. Though at the same time Tavore clearly knew she was special. The best example is Tavores response to questions about who Tamber is with something like shes much more now than she once was. As for why Tamber . doesnt come back well should be clear now that Tamber is dead. I dont think the Eresal could come back as Tamber even if she wanted and if she could thats probably drawing too many questions at that point. The Malazans as a whole are very against being controlled or mettled with by gods. The Malazan Empire is very proud to be unaligned so to speak also why there were lots of people who had issues with Dassem back in the day being such a central figure in the empire when he was sworn to Hood. If anything was going to break The Bonehunters a part it would be if they thought Tavore was having them work for a god regardless of the truth. So the Eresal couldnt show up more directly either. Though I admit its a bit weird how much of a back seat the eresal seems to take after The Bonehunters. I can only conclude that at that point she decided that enough pieces were in place that everything could handle itself.,Malazan,ddsmlym,2,t5_2t1dv

11092909,0,t3_5ydt36,One thing to keep in mind is the story is based off of an RPG.  Often times there are player characters created simply for FUCK YOU DM I HATE YOU SO IM NOT TAKING YOUR SHIT SERIOUSLY!! that inexplicably make savings rolls in certain death situations.  aka Corabb Ublala Kruppe Hellian.Then theres obvious NPCs like Pores TellorastCurdle Iskaral Pores maybe? Kindly Greyfrog.,Malazan,depddih,2,t5_2t1dv
11098064,0,t1_depya6a,...Hmm.  Im trying to remember the death but Im blanking.  So many deaths.They are an arc in the sense that they continue the story of the Crimson guard a lot absolutely.  Great new characters great new plots great new settings.  I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Assail I think its one of the best Malazan books period maybe behind Deadhouse Gates. ,Malazan,depyf8z,2,t5_2t1dv
11144819,0,t1_deu16se,Theyd get along because Quick Ben would ride the wave Mats Taveran plot armor from way out at sea all the way to the damn beach.Granted wed have to decide which universe were working in. In Malazan battle field memories would lead one to trust a squad mage. Wheel of Time has a very different context for men and magic.,Malazan,dev94tm,2,t5_2t1dv

IIRC in GotM the two had a personal thing against Laseen and were working accordingly.

11153332,0,t1_dew5xg9,gtall of those dont necessarily require our world to come into play.They dont no. But Im not convinced it was those guys instead of Erikson having a bit of fun unless its flat out stated somewhere.,Malazan,dew7vfi,1,t5_2t1dv
11200415,0,t3_5zpivx,Im in the middle of restarting the series stopped around  two years ago. Coming back to it a second time Im enjoying even more. I think the reason people find it so difficult and the reason I stopped the first time through is that Erikson has a fairly large and mechanic specified universe developed but unlike most world building authors Ive read he doesnt seem to write the perspective  the readers window on the world with the goal of conveying the central story arc or guiding the reader through the world. Theres next to no exposition of the world or how it works and so jumping in is hard as you kind of have to absorb those details through the osmosis of limited windows. Theres plenty of times where most authors might have used a scene for exposition and Erikson just has oblique references or characters glossing over details known to those in the scene but still a confusing mystery to the reader. I actually really like this style as it gives the world and characters more life for me. It also doesnt help that he shows no mercy with the number of characters with completely foreign names with little indication for most of them how important they may be.,Malazan,df1jxbb,1,t5_2t1dv

11250869,0,t1_df7909c,Thanks I have forgotten most of the details by this point. I think I was merging the fight with Spinnock and the fight with Orfantal in my mind. Spinnock is the one that had the long drawn out sword fight with Kallor right? The one where Kallor actually seemed to have some human emotions and didnt want to kill him.Also while I know that Kallor is cursed to never die that doesnt make him all powerful. I could easily imagine Kallor being beaten and imprisoned or something along those lines. I would imagine Kallor is well aware of his limitations as well because he clearly swallows his pride when it comes to dealing with Brood and Rake implying that he knows they would mop the floor with his face.,Malazan,df79po5,3,t5_2t1dv
11274300,0,t1_df9ussq,I didnt get it at first either but eventually realized that him joking was the only thing that made sense. Weird but still. I also loved how Rake instantly got it though.,Malazan,df9xbsk,3,t5_2t1dv

11478192,0,t1_dfwa4sj,Trust me when I say the more you read the more you LOVE the series.  It is hard not to actually feel like you are kin to some of the characters because SE doesnt hold your hand.  They act talk and feel like you are more there because it isnt narrated or explained down to the detail so you actually have to pay attention and learn for yourself just like the real world.SPOILERRRRRR IDK HOW TO FUCKING FORMAT THISSSSSSSSSDG Spoilers I just absolutely love the part where the Trygalle Trade Guild shows up and the lead mage is talking with Coltaine and he explains how Dujek pretty much funded the shipment of supplies to a NOT VERY CHEAP person with the message saying something like The empress cannot afford to lose Fists like Coltaine of the Crow Clan even though Dujek himself is.... Outlawed..... and at the end of everything the Trygalle guild leader asks if Coltaine had any messages for Dujek in response and all Coltaine says is No.God that fucking line means so much to me now.  It was awesome.I also love when Duiker gets the chance to pretty much choke out the nobleman who pissed me off so much.Oh and the fucking sapper line break on the uphill charge of horses.  Holy. Fucking. Hell.  Gatta love me some crazy ass sappers. ,Malazan,dfx1s9i,2,t5_2t1dv

11496114,0,t1_dfy9ph6,I think a large part of it is also just that people who dont like Malazan as a series likely only read GotM so GotM is the only one they can vogue for as not liking. Not that theyre doing anything wrong. Malazan is certainly a niche series and many people arent going to like it and thats ok. It just has the side effect that more people have read and disliked GotM than any other book in the series just based on it being the first book you read.,Malazan,dfz310j,0,t5_2t1dv
11499534,0,t1_dfz6q0v,I think Silanah was being sarcastic cause Erikson was the one giving the pronunciation as the guest in the podcast and its his book. Hahahahah,Malazan,dfzh02n,6,t5_2t1dv
11500266,0,t1_dfzja9h,Haha no I understood what you meant. I interpreted Silanahs statement to that she didnt like the correct pronunciation so Silanahs statement was a facetious remark on that Of course Erikson is right haha. Anyway one thing that always trips me up are the apostrophes in names am I supposed to use a glottal stop there? I know he references it in one of the books I think its in MOI but I dont know if it only applies to the TLann Imass. Also names like Tehol is it TEhuhl or Tehol? or that one guy Fiddler is it Fiddler or Feedidleedoopler or is it pronounced Strings?,Malazan,dfzjzni,2,t5_2t1dv

11622502,0,t1_dgde3xo,Being on the sixth book as of now Id say forget the reread. If youre going to invest any more time in the series Id say go straight to the next book. You wont get any more answers from rereading the books youve already read only progressing through the series will answer any questions and provide better insight into what is happening.Not only that the writing and characters do get better. Fiddler was sort of so so for me in the first two books but books four and currently six have catapulted him to my top  characters.,Malazan,dgdf6u0,7,t5_2t1dv
