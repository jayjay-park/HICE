8817543,0,t1_d4n5h6o,Hello! Thanks again for your previous commercial fishing answers.I have a random follow up question if you dont mind. No worries if youre too busy or whatever. Regarding rubber fishing boots are those something youd wear when departing the boat and walking through town? Or do you change into other shoes right beforeafter getting off the boat?Thank you!,commercialfishing,d77qywb,1,t5_2suxs
