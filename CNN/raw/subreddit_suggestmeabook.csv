It is quite different from WoT in that it doesnt have the scope of the characters numerically or depth. It is constantly moving and almost always forward. With WoT there are points where it feels like characters are stuck and immobilenot a complaint really functions well in the narrative but Dark Tower series just seems to constantly pick up steam. Itll make you hate characters. Robert Branderson is a great slip. Since he finishes the WoT series it actually is kind of fitting. Name of the Wind is a great book and I love the second King Killer ChronicleWise Mans Fears by Rothfuss as well.

1941048,0,t1_ckmryig,I actually enjoyed We more than I liked  but I understand your points.  definitely goes for a more brainwashing sort of theme where We uses the surgery to remove imagination as an out though at the time the book was written the brain was not well understood and people believed such a procedure to be an actual possibility in the near future and since the surgery no longer seems like a believable possibility I agree that it may not have held up as well.But I also think the books may have different intents. s focus on controlling thought and belief speaks to a position that people can be coerced through propaganda even when the truth is revealed to them. We it seemed to me had a more positive view of humanity. Once shown the truth it takes an invasive external force to physiologically change a person so they are no longer capable of appreciating or believing in that truth.In the end perhaps uummmwhut will read We and make their own decision. But if not then hopefully hell take up your original suggestion because I think The Dispossessed is better than either other book.,suggestmeabook,ckn3c7x,2,t5_31t41

Because if its something she did it may just be that shes not the right one for you. If its something in your past on the other hand its probably worth working on with a therapist or counsellor. Either way though two months is kind of early in a relationship to be having friction which makes me think you may be putting effort into a lost cause and might be better served taking a break from dating for awhile until you either figure out what type of girl would be more compatible with you or work through whatever issues are making you insecure and distrustful.Bookwise though I second the rec for The  Love Languages. It doesnt address trust issues and jealousy directly but its all about how partners can make each other feel loved appreciated and not taken for granted which could have an indirect effect on trust issues by making you feel more secure in your relationship. Its a book thats best read together and discussed though  otherwise one partner is putting in all the effort and the other is reaping all the benefits.,suggestmeabook,cl05u3t,1,t5_31t41

The Four Winds of Love by Compton Mackenzie Wikipedia says six volumes my own printing is eight two for each wind first The East Wind of Love then South West and North.

The various sections are written in different styles as well as different genres and there are no shared characters between the stories. Except it becomes clear at least one and possibly two of the characters are in fact reliving aspects of the lives of the characters in the earlier stories. This is mostly implicit the echoes of the past life are thematic rather than literal but there is a shared birthmark and a cloud atlas which tells you who is who.

Many times his students have come to me to complain about how they didnt get it and how the book frustrated them. I choose not to present it to readers who are new to novels because its satire and its themes dont always land. Satire can be difficult for inexperienced readers. Just going off of what OP said in the post I would still maintain that Animal Farm not be one of their first classics and certainly not their first experience with Orwell. Its totally up to them of course Ive just seem a lot of young people give up reading as an enjoyable experiences because they pick up something someone else says is great it ends up being not so great for the new reader then the reader assumes reading isnt for them. ,suggestmeabook,crq2jw3,2,t5_31t41

If your looking for intellectual stimulation I would recommend non fiction. Fields that interest me are psychology you could check out books in body language I find that most interesting you start sizing up every social scenario you are in. Helps you understand people better. Philosophy books like the outsider and the tunnel for introspective existential themes. Or there are even books that introduce you to the major branches of the subject almost like a crash course. Check out the God delusion for arguments against the existence of God. I like to go through the respective Holy books to understand the other side of it. Brief history of time by Stephen hawking introduces you to topics like quantum physics black holes and how the universe came to be in an extremely simple way...you dont need any science background to understand it and it gives you a good base if you want to continue to read other books on similar topics.,suggestmeabook,crxtkf0,2,t5_31t41

Great YAdeveloping reader selections and they still have rigor and will challenge your students. Provide some classics and more adult reads in there as well for your more proficient readers  depending on your school culture be careful of the novels you select here. For example I require parent permission for books like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo or Gone Girl. Its mostly a CYA thing. I created a challenge shelf where I put more difficult novels and I booktalk one of them a week. Many of my developing readers get hooked into a classic this way.

For exampleAt the end of the book one of the main characters disappears mysteriously from a ship at sea The glowing green apparition that mariners call chainfire began to play about the rigging of the ship. ... One of the other passengers remarked they had not been able to wake the Doctor to come see the display in the first place though nobody thought much of this  the Doctor had been invited to dine with the vessels captain that evening but had sent a note declining the invitation citing an indisposition due to special circumstances.

Das Kapital.  The Wealth of Nations.  Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes.  The Philosophy of History by Hegel. The last two especially for an insight into the dark side of the modern political experiment.

Extremely clever and fun to read. Other suggestions would be The Elementary Particles by Michel Houellebecq Ficciones and The Aleph by Jorge Luis Borges and to some extent The Windup Bird Chronicles by Murakami.Also a couple of movies. Look for Solaris and Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky. Two of the most brilliant philosophical movies Ive ever seen.

7140032,0,t1_d1pclip,Glad to hear it. Id honestly never even heard of the books but there was a childrens literature conference six blocks from my house on Saturday and Ive been studying storytelling in video game form so I thought there might be some good information in the presentations. There definitely was. Kristin Cashore was the keynote speaker and I didnt even realize she was the person sitting directly in front of me for the first two presentations until she was introduced for her talk. She spoke about fiction as a way of dealing with trauma both for writers and readers mostly focusing on Bitterblue.Do you think it matters in which order the books are read? As I understand it Fire is a sort of prequel to Graceling and I know that Bitterblue is an indirect sequel ten years after the fact. Because of good luck Ive had in the past with accidentally reading the second book in an indirect series before the first novel Im tempted to read Bitterblue first.

7306255,0,t3_4fdxpy,The Lovely Bones is in my opinion a beautiful exploration of tragedy and peoples reactions to it.  People seem to either really like it like I do or really dont.If youd like to try nonfiction there is The Year of Magical Thinking in which the author explores her reaction to her husbands sudden death.  She experiences the usual grief but also magical thinking things like I should get rid of his clothes because hes dead  but what if I get rid of them and he comes back and then he has no clothes?Another nonfiction thats not a perfect match but seemed potentially relevant  Revenge A Story of Hope.  The authors father is shot by a terrorist and survives and she decides she needs to find the terrorist and confront him.  Her revenge is not as neat as she had hoped for when she meets the terrorists family.This may seem a silly suggestion but you might potentially get something out of The Princess Bride and Inigo Montoyas quest to avenge his father.  In the film version the actor really connected to his character because his own father had just died cancer and he felt the original author did a good job of nailing those feelings of just wanting someone back so badly.  Its not the main plot of the book but it might help  and it will give you some laughs too.,suggestmeabook,d28o6yg,1,t5_31t41

7912064,0,t3_4nnee7,I feel like I was born for this thread. Here are a couple of my favorites with plot blurbs for the ones I think are lesserknown The Phantom Tollbooth Norton Juster   The House of Thirty Cats Mary Calhoun a young girl named Sarah befriends an older woman who lives in a house with the thirtysome cats shes adopted over the years. But an angry neighbor and a dangerous newcomer threaten the house and its inhabitants.   Someday Angeline Louis Sachar Angeline Persepolis is an eight year old girl who has been moved up to the sixth grade. This of course causes trouble with her schoolmates and her teachers causing her to feel as though she doesnt belong. By the same author as the Wayside School books which are also excellent.   Un Lun Dun China Mieville Zanna and Deeba two middle schoolers discover a strange world connected to their own where things that fall through the cracks end up. A really delightful twist on both the Alice in Wonderland formula and the concept of a chosen one. Full of puns wordplay and really fun imagery.   The Neverending Story Michael Ende Im not fully sure if this one is appropriate for a nine year old as I read it in high school but the story is positively enchanting. A very long read but I think a lot of kids could identify with Bastian.   The Secret Garden Frances Hodgson Burnett   The Graveyard Book Neil Gaiman The Jungle Book but in a graveyard. Could possibly get a little scary for him at some points but Ill leave it here for your discretion.   Coraline Neil Gaiman another take on the Alice in Wonderland trope but with horrifying uses for buttons. Same as The Graveyard Book it might be a little scary depending on how active an imagination your son has. Comes with an equallyunsettling stop motion movie!   From the MixedUp Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler E.L. Konigsburg while I havent read this personally my mom swears by it. From the Goodreads blurb When suburban Claudia Kincaid decides to run away she knows she doesnt just want to run from somewhere she wants to run to somewhere  to a place that is comfortable beautiful and preferably elegant. She chooses the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Knowing her younger brother Jamie has money and thus can help her with a serious cashflow problem she invites him along.   The Tale of Despereaux Kate DiCamillo Despereaux is a little mouse who lives in a castle and becomes obsessed with reading books instead of eating them as the other mice do. Theres a movie version that I havent personally seen but that was apparent fairly good.   Fortunately the Milk Neil Gaiman a very quick and funny read about a dads quest to provide milk for his children.   Walk Two Moons Sharon Creech while on a roadtrip to find her missing mother Sal tells her grandparents a story about her friend Phoebe Winterbottom and their encounters with a lunatic. Sharon Creechs books are normally bittersweet but this one is probably the most so.   Bloomability Sharon Creech Dinnie feels like shes been kidnapped when her parents send her to live with her aunt and uncle in Italy and attend school there.   Ruby Holler Sharon Creech trouble twins Dallas and Florida are considered unadoptable until they are brought to the home of Tiller and Sairy an older couple who are preparing for the adventures of a lifetime.I hope that a couple of these are what youre looking for!,suggestmeabook,d45e2p8,11,t5_31t41

8206957,0,t3_4rqv3d,Youve literally chosen all three of my my favourites series. Except  I slightly prefer The Stormlight Archive to the Mistborn series. Personally I say read them all but read the Kingkiller Chronicles first and I will tell you why. I read the Naming of the wind followed by The Wise mans fear in one sitting. I sat down for  hours and read them both. Im a fast reader though but I couldnt put them down. Theres something about his style of writing and the structure of the story and how the world and characters are so well built and developed. Im not explaining this very well at all but just thinking about those books gets me all worked up Ive reread them countless times and Im eagerly anticipating the Doors of Stone release. So yes read Kingkiller Chronicles Abhorsen is a nice little read as well and then move on to Mistborn. If you like Mistborn and Sandersons style you might want to move on to The Stormlight Archive. Its my favourite of all his work. EDIT because I didnt really answer your question.

8651767,0,t3_4ycedi,How about a book that takes viideo games as art seriously?  My favorite book about video games is Trigger Happy Videogames and the Entertainment Revolution by Steven Poole. Poole has many thoughtful insights into why video games should be considered a separate art form the most interactive form of storytelling to date.  My favorite part of the book is the part where he analyzes various video games archetypes  the powerup health pack extra lives and the health meter for example.  He points out that there was a game without a health meter where a wellplaced weapon blow could instantly win the match but it was not a best seller.  This ties into another one of his themes  we want our games realistic but not too realistic.  A realistic fighting game would probably be dreadfully short and unfun.  A game that allows us to shrug off but only to a limited extent hammer blows to the head is much more entertaining.  Similarly he tells how gamers prefer unrealistic heroes  heroines those modeled after real people were not successes.  His comparison of video game lasers to the way a real laser would work was futilely amusing  amusing because it was accurate futile because most of us gamers want to see the laser blast and the fun of aiming at a moving target.Poole talks about the unrealistic and inconsistent nature of video game worlds but Ive always accepted the conventions as gameplay necessities.  If you can interact with everything in your environment then most of us are likely to spend all our time trying to find the significance of trivial background items.  Almost all of the things he observes are compromises with reality for the same of gameplay.  He made an interesting observation about inconsistencies  in Tomb Raider III the player is given a rocket launcher that can kill a Tyrannosaur but not destroy a wooden door.  I accepted that as how the game designers made me look for that key but Poole found it annoying.  After all if we wanted to play the most realistic football  fighting game wed be playing football or practicing in the dojo.The biggest flaw in this book is that Poole doesnt really give any attention to the strategic  simulation games.  Instead he focuses on actionoriented games.  He admits to this flaw in a roundabout way when he says that he has no interest in these types of games.  By giving these games short shrift Poole misses one of the greatest appeals of video games  the chance to play god at varying levels.  As he points out in even the reflexbased games you have the divine power of resurrecting yourself an unlimited number of times.  The strategy  simulation games give you a chance to take command of people at the individual level all the way up to galactic empires run them the way you want to and see the results.  This is a very powerful appeal.  These games deserve at least as much thoughtful analysis as action  exploration games do.  Unfortunately Pooles book doesnt provide that examination.  Another flaw is the lack of pictures.  Any book about video games should be packed with pictures of what the author is describing.  Aside from the glaring omission of god games and the lack of pictures this is still a very interesting book about video games and worth reading for all gamers.if you want just a history Id recommend High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games by Rusel DeMaria and Johnny L. Wilson.  I have the second edition which goes up to Playstation .  I hope theres a newer edition.  The thing I loved the most about this book is that it is amply illustrated.  Every page has at least one picture of the games under discussion.  The games themselves are described  brief summaries of the most popularinfluential games are included.  This is a very good history of video games.,suggestmeabook,d6n31lt,1,t5_31t41

He talks more indepth about it on his semiautobiography On Writing and how he got through it. I leave that just as a suggestion if she gets into his work since she might find it relatable. But I dont know maybe she cant even deal with the topic at all at the moment. Thats fine.Carrie is great though I think it has some alcohol and marijuana use. The Dark Tower deals with heroine addiction mentions of different drugs and alcoholism so I dont think its the best choice right now.  is really good.

Sometimes he gets a little wordy but overall the book almost exactly recreates the feel of Yharnim and all its innards.Just keep in mind it isnt a happy book.

Written by Naoki Higashida a very smart very selfaware and very charming thirteenyearold boy with autism it is a oneofakind memoir that demonstrates how an autistic mind thinks feels perceives and responds in ways few of us can imagine. Parents and family members who never thought they could get inside the head of their autistic loved one at last have a way to break through to the curious subtle and complex life within. Using an alphabet grid to painstakingly construct words sentences and thoughts that he is unable to speak out loud Naoki answers even the most delicate questions that people want to know. Questions such as Why do people with autism talk so loudly and weirdly? Why do you line up your toy cars and blocks? Why dont you make eye contact when youre talking? and Whats the reason you jump? Naokis answer When Im jumping its as if my feelings are going upward to the sky. With disarming honesty and a generous heart Naoki shares his unique point of view on not only autism but life itself. His insightsinto the mystery of words the wonders of laughter and the elusiveness of memoryare so startling so strange and so powerful that you will never look at the world the same way again. In his introduction bestselling novelist David Mitchell writes that Naokis words allowed him to feel for the first time as if his own autistic child was explaining what was happening in his mind. It is no exaggeration to say that The Reason I Jump allowed me to round a corner in our relationship. This translation was a labor of love by David and his wife KA Yoshida so theyd be able to share that feeling with friends the wider autism community and beyond. Naokis book in its beauty truthfulness and simplicity is a gift to be shared.,suggestmeabook,db2iqgp,8,t5_31t41

10029050,0,t3_5jam6r,If you want to stick with Pynchon Bleeding Edge has a similar pace humor and paranoia to it. Its a little more serious than Inherent Vice but not vast or difficult like the big books are. Id say the two have more in common than any of his other work. Outside of that I really dont know. Inherent Vice is like a stoner surf rock noir novel which of course isnt really a thing. Pynchon is unique and not for everybody...so youre lucky! Id suggest reading more because Gravitys Rainbow and Mason amp Dixon are up there with the best for me. ,suggestmeabook,dbet9z8,3,t5_31t41

Keeping an eye on this thread for Bobesque recommendations.I followed Bob up with The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet which focused less on technology although there is some technobabble about AIs and hyperspace tunneling and more on the sociology of a bunch of different types of alien races. The crew in the book is a mix of interesting characters and reminiscent of Firefly but the overall story is less focused. Think of it more as a fixup of various character short stories and its pretty fun. The details about the Wayfarer ship itself and the description of the year long journey might meet some of what youre looking for though.Other recommendations for detailed space traveltechnology I really enjoyed but less fun than Bob are Stephensons Seveneves and Alastair Reynolds Pushing Ice.,suggestmeabook,dbfxtv7,3,t5_31t41

10298957,0,t3_5ng756,My grandma is an avid reader and taught kids who had trouble reading in elementary school for  years for free. She always says I never taught anyone to read I just showed them how to like to read. She never gave the kids a book to read she would ask them their interests and find out what they enjoy then go to the store and find books pertaining to that subject. She would then take the books back the next time they met and give them too the kids and read with them. So sorry if this is rambling on but my suggestion is to not give them a book to read but find something they really enjoy and find a book pertaining to that. Just dont force it. If the kid likes dirt bikes find a dirt bike book. It just has to be interesting to them. Edit Captain Underpants might be worth a shot for the  year old. Thats some good classic humor. Magic Tree House might be good for either of them. They are short easy reads and there is tons of them so youre bound to find one that interests them. Easy reads that arent intimidating itll show them that reading isnt difficult. ,suggestmeabook,dcbfxu6,8,t5_31t41

10316488,0,t3_5njmh9,I saw the post and took the risk to read it.  You could say that I am someone who has a very similar problem to that your wife has with the end of ones life.  For me the greatest fear can be not knowing not only what will happen to me but to loved ones loved institutions wanting to know everything that will come to pass.  It can come in the middle of a show or book Ive read dozens of times with pleasure or from a conversation point.  The fear and absolute shock to your system is terrifying and frustrating because even someone trying to hold you might not bring the comfort you need if your mind realizes that their ability to give you that embrace will end at some point.  It is doubly problematic for me as my profession focuses on history the stories of the dead itself it might be said so it can and does come up at the oddest of times even though I love history with a consuming passion that few things can match it.The best thing I have found is to keep the mind busy.  If shes able to focus on this idea its because everything else has been cleared from her head if she is anything like me.  As such finding books that please her and help her fall into the narrative or story regardless of the topic would be best.  Its when one has the ability to question the motives of the book or the purpose of books in a civilization that will be gone that it will become a problem.,suggestmeabook,dcdfhik,1,t5_31t41

The writing just isnt something Pulitzerworthy but Ill be damned if the read isnt filled with interesting concepts and amusing jokes.Unless you are talking about Allegiant in which case I refuse to discuss it.

Herbert novels The Jesus Incident A Man of Two Worlds TJI sequel. The Jesus Incident will definitely impress you. Its a spectacular novel one of my all time favorites. A Man of Two Worlds was also really good but its a bit more light hearted which is not a knock ont it. Its just different in tone but its really good if youre looking for something thats not so intense but still meaningful. I forgot what the next book after TJI is called but I couldnt get through it. The only other sci fi books that have really impressed me were  and The Handmaids Tale. I read a lot of Heinlein when I was younger but as an adult I didnt really like them. Thats all I know about sci fi. The Dune books his son wrote were okay. I thought they were missing the philosophical depth his father reached but theyre easy reads to fill your time if you want to go that route. I read most of them one summer. Theyre okay.,suggestmeabook,dd9a3so,3,t5_31t41

Everyone has different tastes and this is my own. I found Robopocalpyse so poorly written that I couldnt actually force myself to continue reading it. The best way I can describe it is thus  take World War Z remove all of the charisma and fascinating storyarcs within the individual chapters add in some generic Terminator themes and youre left with Robopocalypse. I can only stand so much deus ex machina being utilized as a plot device through  or so pages... so I just stopped reading. I would not spend money on it. I would rent it from a library.

11210655,0,t3_600gm7,gtI really want to get to reading some classic literature from around the world to develop myself as well as understanding the numerous farreaching cultural references.gtThe issue is is that I didnt develop patience while reading so dont have a good attention span if the plot does not move at a good speed.gtIm wondering if there is a method to approaching the idea of teaching myself to read better?Judging by these quotes the best advice I can give you is to begin to consciously practice discipline with regards to your reading in a way that goes beyond the plot. For me it just comes down to having to make a choice to put in effort and work towards changing yourself rather than trying to find a book that will do it by itself. Classic Literature is full of books with amazing plots but the language structure style and other facets used to deconstruct and describe a work are just as important arguably more so. One strategy I would suggest to you is to read out loud to try to gain an appreciation of the rhythm of every different author In a sense act out the book like an audiobook or dramatic production verbally annunciating the punctuation silences and emphases. This helps gain a much more penetrating sense of the sound of each individual authors voice. East of Eden is a book I would recommend reading Steinbeck has a music to him that holds its weight with any other,suggestmeabook,df2pr4t,3,t5_31t41

11238621,0,t3_608gu9,Theres a lot of great recs here already but Ill toss in a few more. I personally second Flowers for Algernon and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Theyre among my favorites of all time though both are heartbreaking in their own ways. I do want to stress that its not abnormal for you to be feeling the way you are describing. Youre hitting adulthood and seeing that the world is bigger than the one you were used to when you were younger. That can be a really rough adjustment even for the good kids. Am I speaking from experience? Ohhhhh yes. Youre going about it the right way  seeking knowledge and understanding is both intelligent and admirable. Keep reading keep thinking keep questioning... youll get there. With that in mind heres some thoughts The Things They Carried by Tim OBrien  I read this around  or  and it really shocked my system. Its about a platoon of American soldiers in the Vietnam war. Its a work of fiction but OBrien plays with the boundaries of reality quite a bit for example the protagonist is also named Tim OBrien and that is not were the oddities end. Brings up a lot of questions about the necessity and the justness of war or lack thereof.  Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishigiro  another book I read in college that stuck with me ever since. Its about students at an isolated boarding school in England and something is off about the whole thing. The slow reveal about whats going on is amazing and it definitely got me thinking about some higher moral quandaries I was not expecting to confront. Testimony by Anita Shreve  another book set in a boarding school but this one explores how one criminal accusation can send devastating ripples through an entire community. It made me question a lot about the concepts of guilt and innocence and if I remember correctly it prominently features student athletes as main characters. Hope this helps! Good luck and happy reading. P.S. youre not the only one who did not understand East of Eden. I read it in high school and remember thinking the whole time there had to be something I was missing. Its on my list of reread now that you can adult books because Im curious to see if I have some better insight these days. I did really like Steinbecks Of Mice and Men though... I found it far more straightforward and nice and short. ,suggestmeabook,df5vqro,1,t5_31t41

In this dark urban fantasy from acclaimed author Victoria Schwab a young woman and a young man must choose whether to become heroes or villainsand friends or enemieswith the future of their home at stake. gt Kate Harker and August Flynn are the heirs to a divided citya city where the violence has begun to breed actual monsters. All Kate wants is to be as ruthless as her father who lets the monsters roam free and makes the humans pay for his protection. All August wants is to be human as goodhearted as his own father to play a bigger role in protecting the innocentbut hes one of the monsters. One who can steal a soul with a simple strain of music. When the chance arises to keep an eye on Kate whos just been kicked out of her sixth boarding school and returned home August jumps at it. But Kate discovers Augusts secret and after a failed assassination attempt the pair must flee for their lives. In This Savage Song Victoria Schwab creates a gritty seething metropolis one worthy of being compared to Gotham and to the four versions of London in her critically acclaimed fantasy for adults A Darker Shade of Magic. Her heroes will face monsters intent on destroying them from every sideincluding the monsters within.Its a little hard to describe because the plot is so very unique. But its definitely dystopian because it takes place in Americas futureIm not sure how far in Americas future howeverwhere the country has been formed and mutilated into something else.

There are web sites featuring searchable databases of all the early Church Fathers a good resource. One is called earlychristianwritings.com or something along those lines.
