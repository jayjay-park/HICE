Suddenly your restaurant is seeing x the business as before. Do you hire new waiters for one week only to fire them the next when your business goes back to normal? No of course not.Likewise a company like Walmart isnt going to buy more infrastructure to support a sudden and massive influx of traffic especially since theyre going to sell every NES Classic anyway and nobodys going to stop buying from Walmart because their webstore shit the bed for ten minutes.,minines,da56tt8,5,t5_3fgf2

Maybe  mins later the manager came back out and said that she was so sorry and that she was wrong.  They were all looking for a case of NESs and didnt see that so they assumed they didnt get any.  What actually happened was that the case had been opened at the distribution center and they had two NESs just jammed into another box of stuff.

This is just my opinion though. Look at Amiibo.  Nintendo continues to release new lines of amiibo all the time.  If the original didnt sell well we would not be seeing these new lines.Nintendo hasnt made any announcements yet.  I wouldnt expect any for a while.It could be possible that they announce a NES Classic  with different games or perhaps the ability to download games before they go to a SNES Classic.

Youd also likely have issues between how software emulation works for drawing raster graphics versus how the original hardware drew them.    Basically aside from needing a CRT youd also need the original NES or one of the highend FPGA clones to get this to work in most scenarios.,minines,ddnks15,3,t5_3fgf2

I found a  CRT flat screen glass is flat rather than curved Toshiba circa  on Craigslist for . Id forgotten how large  is for a CRT in this era of HDTV but it looks AMAZING and the light gun works flawlessly. Highly recommended course of action. Plus then you have actual cartridges with artwork. ,minines,dgb46ei,1,t5_3fgf2

11741742,0,t3_67ibti,Unless Im missing some of the story here or misunderstanding it altogether I think the guy from Reddit who sold you the NES Classic is a scumbag. I say that because he told you hed refund only partial payment? When he got both payments that totaled the amount you agreed upon he either shouldve refunded in full or sent the damn thing out in the mail and be a man of his word. He probably had a change of heart and made up a story about his wife nagging him about it after realizing he couldve potentially made more. I had a similar situation happen years ago when I attempted to buy a pair of Nike Air Yeezys in . I sent full payment to the guy he kept my money for a few days and then inexplicably refunds me the money to someone who had evidently offered more. Shouldve been a man about it and honored the sale. But society is full of scumbags so its actually not that surprising.,minines,dgqyfsk,3,t5_3fgf2

11771906,0,t1_dgu6ev0,I grabbed an Edge Gamepad which is basically the exact same thing as the Ortz one that uarminus posted and it works pretty well. It looks good the buttons feel decent and the turbo is a nifty addon for a few games like Mega Man where button mashing is necessary. HOWEVER be aware that you need to get the V ones that come with an adapter. If you get one without an adapter its a V and wont work at all.,minines,dgudlby,2,t5_3fgf2
