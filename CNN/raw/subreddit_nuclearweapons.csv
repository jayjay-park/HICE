8782857,0,t1_d73hddv,gt Im not brushing over anything here.yes you are. you are attempting to paper over the fact that there would have been a much higher loss of life both civilian and military if Japan was invaded and that those people would have suffered much more than the  odd people who turned into their own shadows in an instant and therefore were probably never even aware that they were under attack.gt citation neededhere you gogt I never made that attempt in the first place.really?,nuclearweapons,d73j1wa,1,t5_2tcny
9733519,0,t1_dacou60,I doubt fallout would be a huge problem if I stayed indoors. Itd just increase my chances of getting cancer and at an earlier age. rd degree burns is what had me more worried ,nuclearweapons,dacva08,1,t5_2tcny
10005311,0,t1_dbbnpoz,Wheres New Zealand or Australia? Im pretty sure the North Island of New Zealand would be a better bet than a desolate wasteland where nothing grows or an island which is pretty much the poster child for unsustainable development. ,nuclearweapons,dbbpymg,3,t5_2tcny

11214100,0,t1_df31q40,The fact that were all still alive counts for something. However the only way to really test a system and prove beyond any doubt that every part of it works the way you thought it would is to use it. Maybe we should just keep rescheduling that.I also avoided saying the Chinese would immediately hack our nukes if they thought they could. Testing often uncovers flaws in everyones plans and nuclear war is still kind of bad even if you win. Would ruin the global economy.,nuclearweapons,df33sge,2,t5_2tcny

11620496,0,t1_dgd4pmk,I agree the time of using multimegaton weapons is long gone but I still think that responding to any nuclear attack with conventional weapons is misguided at best. Radicals and despots would likely perceive this limited type of response as a weakness and quite possibly convince them that our reluctance to use nuclear weapons is so strong that even more madmen could be emboldened to acquire and use nukes.,nuclearweapons,dgd6zwn,1,t5_2tcny
