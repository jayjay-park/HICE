If I was taking a carrier Id go with a Nimitz or Ford.  Reason being is it has double the air wing.  I would rather have more aircraft.  ,WorldOfWarships,cfkm6is,0,t5_2t8uj

The Cleveland for example is a late WW CL. CA are up armored Cruisers sometimes with bigger guns as well. For example the maligned Pensacola is a early WW CA. BC are up gunned and up armored CA. Generally meant to bridge the gap between Cruisers and Battleships they typically mount battleship size weaponry although not the absolute biggest guns like  inchers but more like s. They are supposed to be faster than things that can kill them BB. But have enough firepower to kill anything that can catch them like DD CL and CA. ,WorldOfWarships,cpw87x0,1,t5_2t8uj

3701390,0,t3_32s1ec,My initial thoughtsAudio starts a bit late s in and its dead quiet I can hear the audio starting but you still dont talk for another few seconds.The ship comparison is nice might be an idea to have it live and show the stats on each section like the AA range Main gun range turn time and how they compare between the two ships.Bit strange to have the match starting around the  mark with the ship comparison still up in front and then keeping it up for another minute while talking about the turret traverse speed.The battle is nice you talk about the ship and your piloting decisions in the quiet moments which I like but then you go quiet and dont talk for a few minutes from  to about . Goes quiet again after that if nothing is happening then speed up the replay a little.At the end of the match you seem to go over the battle rather than the ship but then you do go in and talk about the ship after that while its in port.Overall I like it shows some good gameplay and how you like to play it which seems to work using the great RoF to lay down withering fire on anything in range.One big thing that Im not sure you mentioned about the ship which is the major drawback the gun range is very poor only km the same as the surface spotting range this means that you can never engage a ship without being spotted.,WorldOfWarships,cqe6lo2,3,t5_2t8uj

Im not sure if the caliber of the guns makes a difference or not so Im not sure how that carries over to larger ships that happen to end up in and around the smoke. I had an instance where a battleship appeared out of a smokescreen m from my ship and collided with me. Im not sure if he was firing at the time or not but it was a little wonky. I dont think anyone really understands all of the exact mechanics of the smokescreens yet correct me if Im wrong here folks but I feel like Ive gotten a pretty good feel for it at this point.

3837386,0,t3_34dnel,Firstly in my experience IJN cruisers can turn very well. However their big weakness is their large sides which makes it pretty easy to penetrate their citadels.AA defence isnt as good as a sametier USN cruiser but you still have the barrage skill so make good use of it whenever you see planes going after your battleships.Tacticswise never ever cruise in a straight line if you know someone can see you. Balance out firing with a zigzag course try to time it that your guns are loaded and ready to fire when youre broadside to target then immediately turn to narrow your profile when the guns have fired. Dont be afraid to disengage if targets find a range on you. Avoid brawling especially with other CAs. Youll want to engage targets that are shooting something else. That being said the .s on the IJN cruisers are pretty good guns with good penetration and damage and are excellent support weapons on targets that are engaged with something else. Torpedoes are a punishment weapon for IJN cruisers and the reason why they can give a battleship a bad day. Dont deliberately try to charge enemy lines in hopes of launching a longrange torpedo run at targets. Your visibility means its rarely ever going to work unless you launch on a tunnelvisioned player. What torpedoes can do however is inflict major punishment on any ship that tries to get up close with you. Enemy cruiser tries to brawl close range? Disengage and send a pattern of torpedoes across his course. Destroyer wants to brawl with their superior maneuverability? Punish them Battleship moving past an island when youre on the other side? Launch torps thatll hit them the moment they clear the island.,WorldOfWarships,cqtp1by,3,t5_2t8uj

Other nations I believe called their equivalent ship class a Corvette. It wasnt fast enough to keep up with a fast task force but it could keep up with freighters and had decent ASW capability. Basically a slower smaller lighter armed version of a DD. When assigned to a combat group instead of convoy duty they were often paired with the small CVEs Casablanca class the so called kaiser coffins that were built on the liberty cargo ship hulls as they were slow as balls as well.

3887608,0,t1_cqzepk1,Most US battleships were designed with enough armor to be able to withstand their own shells at typical engagement ranges.  Given the early feedback on the .. patch I think this will be reflected in the game.  Watch the latest anchor report.  He strait up tells us that he was in a game in a BB under heavy fire and took  damage.  The brief clip at the end before he derps into a torp spread he takes almost no damage at all under fire from at least  ships.  This armor buff is going to be huge.  Most US BBs had massive armor advantages over their IJN counterparts until the Yamato.  We also havent yet seen the dispersion characteristics of the guns on the US BBs.

You can use gold to buy premium ships premium time garageport slots. It can be also also used for crew training conversion of experience to free experience and demounting of equipment. Yes you need to pay real money for premium ships directly or in form of gold. The premium ships should be balanced in that way that they are better then stock ships of the same tier but worse then elite versions. WG is hard trying to not introduce any pay to win elements or remove them. currently the grind is greatly accelerated so we can get and test the ships. The amount of grind depends on the ship level. For the low tiers you can get the necessary experience and credits in  games but to get tier  ship you will have to play hundredths of games . No. It is entirely possible to play the game for free and still fully enjoy it. You only have to sped money in case you want to buy gold premium time or another premium ship. The higher tier ships above tier  usually loose money so it is necessary to play games in lower tier shipspremium ships to earn credits.  Normal matchmaking for each ships is  tiers for DD it is   I think.  There is no advantage to play higher tier  it only depends on you  which ships you want to play.

One where people want to join because of reputation and skill. Not only that but because its where they want to be clan wise. I hope to get to that point some day. Until then I will travel the road not paved in stone but in open seas and rough waters. Good luck finding your home!   Levo,WorldOfWarships,cs5f4ix,2,t5_2t8uj

4437349,0,t3_3bv0l3,Repost of mine on a previous thread..In Closed beta I made it all the way up to the Fletcher at the moment Im on the Clemson class and I dont see the problem...I havent really noticed a difference between CBT and now I feel like the playstyles are still mostly applicable.Sure theyre not flashy and they cant bring invisible death to their enemies by staying in concealment and giving the gift of torpedoes invisibly Im looking at you Minekaze but Ive found two playstyles that are still incredibly effective.The first utilizes the most basic of weapons fire. Being on fire really really sucks. It hurts over time and adds up to surprising amounts. USN DDs still have good guns that can light ships on fire fairly consistently you just have to not be the primary target of anyone which is fairly simple given the ranges you can fire at and the fear smoke you can spurt out if you find yourself in someones gun sights. Even if someone does see you and start shooting youre tiny and nimble! Utilize it! I find myself a nice big lemming train of friendly ships and dodge dip dive duck and dodge around amongst them spreading fire like a kid with a box of matches. Wait for one of the big dumb and slow BBs fire off their big dumb and slow guns then pump him full of HE until hes on fire then hide again. Rinse and repeat. You wont get the flashy kills and such but Ive had games where Ive done upwards of k fire damage just from antagonizing the bigger and dumber ships.The other way Ive found reasonable success as a USN DD is simply ambushing. Use the turbo boost feature to make a bee line to the lee side of an island wait for the big dumb and slow ships to mosey by utilizing the island to stay hidden for as long as possible and then pounce! The reload rate on the short range torpedos is absolutely silly. You can scramble for  seconds while everyones trying to figure out how you got in amongst them which means thats  torpedos you can dispense freedom with. My personal favorite is sailing between two enemy BBs who had their guns pointed the wrong way because their secondaries have absolutely no compunction about lighting up friendlies.Once youre using center line mounted tubes and the reload speeds are getting longer torpedoes become a weapon of opportunity on isolated targets. Once you have isolated a wild BB from its herd wait for its weapons to discharge and then pounceSure that method leads to a lifespan measured in seconds rather than minutes if you miss but you can do some serious harm to an enemy team if you plan things out correctly. Especially if you get the camouflage that magically makes shells less likely to hit you somehow. If nobody swings by your island go CV hunting. CVs absolutely love discovering an American DD is less than km away while their big dumb and slow escorts are all faffing about far far away.TL DRAs a class USN destroyers arent intended to be driven like IJN DDs with their ninja torpedos. Theyre support ships designed to feast on IJN DDs along with antagonizing bigger ships,WorldOfWarships,csq0h4s,3,t5_2t8uj

4437724,0,t1_cspzkf0,It does matter whether you turn into or away depending how close the torps are.  Into if it is feasible is always preferable.  Turning away results in you being in their line of fire for far longer and due to the way a ship turns with the ass swinging out it can result in you eating more torps than you otherwise would.If youre going perpendicular and there isnt a ship or island that would threaten you turn into them.  If youre already somewhat pointed away or youre fleeing a DD turn away.,WorldOfWarships,csq26eq,2,t5_2t8uj

Carrier planes do not count.Shooting increases your concealment range by km on destroyers km on cruisers and km on battleships. So if you have a concealment range of km and you fire your guns and no enemy is within km you will not be spotted.Being on fire also increases your concealment range by km in destroyers km in cruisers and km in battleships.Being behind islands or similar will not increase concealment numerically.

If the ship is angled towards you aim a bit lower if its angled away aim higher.Leading is a bit more difficult because it also depends on the guns you have and the speed of your enemy and your relative speed to the enemy. If youre sailing parallel to the enemy but in opposite directions more lead is necessary than normal for example.

4488289,0,t1_cswaywq,Oh that is probably why. I will try to make a scenario. Imagine you are holding the D key which as we know means steering right but the ship turns left.... Dafuq? Even worst on world of tanks. Imagine you are a TD aiming on the side of a hill for the sake of this scene imagine redshire. When all of the sudden a medium tank goes around and flanks you starts putting shots into the weak back. Hes roughly  on the clock is that right? You know how in movies they say on your ? Anyways as any other person would do you turn your front to them right? So you start moving the butt of your tank suy or jgtg . or whatever AWAY from him well you hold the button lets say s and d and for a split second you turn as appropriate but suddenly it inverses and you show even more of your butt than before..... WHY THE FUCK WOULD IT INVERT? and that is my problem with the steering mechanism in this game. Theres a check box that fixes this on Tanki online but not on wot.

Soviets will still be next as far as I know though because Russian devs and their Russian players from other games. No current release date though. August has been tossed around as a month for premium releases but that is just rumors at best.The Russians apparently suck at WoWS for the record I have heard multiple people say that the vast majority across the tiers basically just run and brawl it out with torps and guns immediately and most games are done in less than  minutes. This is word of mouth stories of course so a grain of salt is wise. Either way we can observe results of this in that Russians apparently think the Omaha is weak as per a translated dev post from the Russian forums and it is likely to be buffed as a result.

4594153,0,t1_ct9dx8l,In the later tiers even though US CVs are meant to be fighterdive bomber based IJN CVs get better fighter setups. The Taiho at tier  gets  fighters  torp  dive. More than enough firepower to take out ships and those  fighter groups can do damage especially if they have the air supremacy skill giving them  planes per wing. The Hakuryu at tier  gets  fighter wings with  torp  dive. With the  point skill it can dramatically overpower the Essex and Midway carriers which at most can pump out  fighter groups giving them   with pt skill and thats only if they give up their ability to attack enemy ships as they no longer get torpedo squads with their fighter setups an awful trend in USN CV fighter setups. I would agree that tiers  and  the roles between IJN and USN CVs reverse. USN CVs benefit more from the strike setup getting dual  plane torpedo wings being able to devastate enemy ships and IJN CVs benefit from the fighter setups launching more squadrons to overpower enemy air.

4605731,0,t3_3e35as,The most important skill BB and CV players in this game have to learn is to play and plan ahead. Smoke for example is a sure tell of a DD and with a little bit of experience you will get a hang of where DD tend to ambush you. Spotted a DD? Always expect torps to have been fired in your direction and take at least some evasive action immediately. At longer ranges even a slight course or speed change will accomplish a lot.When theyre spotted and closing in run away change course and speed constantly to throw off their torps and increase run times even outrunning them if they were fired atnear max range. Concentrate your fire on the little buggers even if you have AP loaded  a full salvo of AP can often sink DD or at least hurt them badly.Think about your secondaries as well. Getting them up to km range isnt too hard on most BB. These hurt fragile ships like DD a lot when they get into the comfort zone most have to get closer than km to reliably use their torps  even the km range will get close to reduce your chances of evasionAnd most importantly  work with your team. Tell them to focus down a specific enemy if they dont do it on their own. Ask for help if in a tight spot and ping the map once or twice no kamikaze pinging plz where you need it. If you have  CADD concentrating fire on them enemy DD will have a hard time getting anything done and staying alive.,WorldOfWarships,ctb4yup,3,t5_2t8uj

When the games arent above a couple of T present its actually a fairly decent SmashFucker  It doesnt suit many peoples play style nor really mine actually.But I do indeed think that many people misexperience the Kawachi because they play it like they would expect a battleship to be played. And that is wrong. Its pretty much the same for the US one too. Heres the harsh truth people Tier  battleships shouldnt be considered battleships. They both lack the range for one. And in South Carolinas case the survivability ramming an upgraded hull St Louis will ALWAYS kill you.  No they fall short of what Battleships are going to be. At least the IJN line because I havent played the USN. God help you if the line feels like a continuing South Carolina.But I digress. Heres how I personally see the Kawachi performing. Its not a sure fire. Its not a You will win everytime all the time type of advice. Its merely how I saw Kawachi give best results. My winrate on it is still average between  and  and my average Exp per game probably isnt even over  because with it its either Steamroll Victory or nearly nothing gained. Theres a middle but I dont see it as often as an average would suggest.First of all the basics   You are outranged. There is no point hanging behind. The only reason you want to be behind is because your speed doesnt let you go faster. Get in their face though not too recklessly.   You are inaccurate. Get used to it. Expect the worse every shot and unless youre real closezeroed in avoid full broadsides even though instincts wants to fire all those big guns at the puny bugs floating defiantly around you.   You are outran. Youre slow as fuck. Dont expect to catch up to something that doesnt actually want you to be close. But people think Kawachi are easy prey theyll most likely come closer. And youll hurt but if youre not on fire youre probably too far to shoot anything anyways. You can allow a lone fire to burn without a worry. Youre a fucking Kawachi.   You are the toughest rock to float. At this tier nothing is more survivable than you. Not even the South Carolina. You could ram anything and kill it. If you manage to catch them. I dont advise focusing on ramming as this kind of tunnel vision will prevent you from using Kawachis actual strong point.   You are a fucking Cameleoneyed gun emplacement. Nothing can get you on your unprotected side. You can have guns pointed literally all around you. Never be caught with your pants down.That was a lot of negative bold text wasnt it? I mean   So how do you play this rock target practice turtle Master of the Seas?  Expect to suck. Yep. Why? Because then you can only do better than expected. That doesnt mean you should suck. In fact. Let that expectation fuel your determination to prove every Sunday Sailor wrong and that you are the Captain so better than everyone than you can literally turn a rock underestimated ship into their crushing death. Your objective is to bring as many down with you as you sink like the fucking rock you are said to be. On your bad games everyone will say  Its okay he was in the Kawachi so he couldnt really do anything. No one will hold it against you. However when you win people will question how you could possibly do that. And you do that by taming this beast. Its a slow calm beast. With outburst of anger. Like a rhino.  But I KEEP DIGRESSING Im sorry. Ill try and finish short. Use cover. Your range shortcomings should be hint enough that you wont do well on open sea.   Be alert. You are slow to react and if you stick to cover rich areas like archipelagoes you will likely encounter agile cruisers and DDs.  Expect to you want to chew on them. The fact you have guns ready to fire on both sides means its harder to take you by surprise. Make sure you look around every   seconds or so.   Be aggressive. People expect Kawachi to be easy preys because they miss a lot and are easily outrange. Get in their bloody fucking face when you can. Kawachi got the best secondary of the tier IMO and those will start fires on those flies buzzing around you. Your salvoes will cripple small ships and at this range its far easier to aim. and harder to dodge. Dodging is not one of your concerns most of the time because you are durable as fuck.   Be the escort. Weird huh? People keep saying BBs need cruiser escort and they are right. However dont picture your self in the supported role in a Karachi. If anything Cruisers of the tier shoot faster more accurately and further than you. You arent the asset to protect. So what do you escort? Your escorts. You can take a beating and as said youre a big fire magnet when the ranges shorten. Every shot you get pulled your way is a shot not thrown at your more fragile buddies. You love your buddies you want them to live and love you back. So stick with them and punish anything that looks at them wrong. Go teeths out and take the fall if you must. Dont sacrifice yourself foolishly but dont be afraid to roar and flex your guns.   Waddle. The waddle term not mine is a good way to have way more guns than your alter ego the South Carolina. You waddle by facing your target. That will also make you less prone to hits and citadels unless shots are coming from the side too. You tilt  your course to have the front turret and turrets on one side to fire at your target ahead. Dont go Full rudder because you want to quickly tilt in the other direction to fire the turrets on your OTHER side. Rince and repeat.   If collision seems unavoidable ram it. Dont chicken out because whatever it is youll most likely take it down unless its a full HP T bB or CV. If youre the one with almost full HP and ramming it would kill you try and dodge if the game is still far from settled. However last minute turns are tough in a Kawachi.  I personally see a Kawachi as the Tank support of infantry rather than the tank that infantry supports. It is usually a target that is left to later if possible but prioritized when the opportunity to kill it arise. And on its own its easy to flank or deal with it. So dont stay alone.And last of all. Its a fucking short grind. Stick to Random battles. All the time. The grind at tier  is ridiculously short. If you are seriously feeling it long you are either  playing a couple of matches with it a day or way unprepared for the grinds to come.  Even if you hate it. Play it. get through it short as possible. Switching between ships that play differently will throw a lot of players off especially starting ones. A BB handles differently than a cruiser and a DD. Switching back and forth screws up your reactions and accuracy in most cases. If you play the Kawachi in Random Battles for  evenings you will be through. Done. Adios.  It really shouldnt be a grind. Its merely an uncomfortable cough to get through.,WorldOfWarships,ctlh8op,5,t5_2t8uj

4796831,0,t3_3gl68b,IX  Iowa  Pros Three hardhitting triplebarrel guns.  Rear gun aims quite a bit further forward than on the North Carolina and the guns are a fair bit more accurate as well.  With the bow facing the enemy and angled a bit you will take very little if any damage from AP from all ships save the Yamato.  The Superstructure is a tad bugged apparently which results in an upperlimit to the HE damage that can be done to it.  The Iowa is Im fairly certain the fastest Battleship out there.  At just shy of  knots shes a speedster.  Extremely good AA means you will shred planes that make the mistake of flying over or past you however...Cons  ...as good as your AA is it isnt good enough to kill more than one or two Tier  bombers on approach before they drop.  If the CV captain is stilled he will hit you with several full spreads.  This ties into the other problems the Iowa is a big ship and though her rudder shift is respectable it takes a while to get that big ass around.  Anticipate as best you can the torpedo bombers and your AA will lessen the blow but expect to eat a lot of planelaunched torps.  In addition though the frontal armor is great dont show your broadside unless you absolutely have to.  Nagatos North Carolinas Amagis especially will all wreck you if you give them a clean shot.  Ts and s will too obviously.  The stern is fairly weak  up close you can be Citadelled straight through the stern by the Iowas own s and up close on the sides... well your citadels are big targets.  I have a number of Iowa kills painted on my hull from knife fighting and getting the first salvo off after the first pass.  As fast as the Iowa is she loses speed very quickly with any kind of maneuvering.  A slight  turn will cut your speed by a third.  Lastly... because she is huge it can be tough to avoid suicide rammers at times.  Do your best.  All in all the Iowa is an incredibly potent ship.  Treat her well and shell treat you well.  Abuse her and youll feel the pain.  I recommend pairing it with either a USN CA or a Fighter loadout CV if you have friends.  Also always prioritize torpedo squadrons with AA but try to leave squadrons with a single plane alive.  Theyre easier to dodge not threatening and force the CV to wait longer to rearm.,WorldOfWarships,ctz6gwu,2,t5_2t8uj

Mogami Atlanta and Cleveland all do fairly disproportionate amount of damage or so it seems.The most ridiculous part are the captain skills. Yes. On paper Atlanta has very short range. However you get  from captain skill making it mediocre. The  reload time is great as well. The thing is even with all this Atlanta is not as great as Cleveland or Mogami just because it is indeed extremely easy to sink. You dont want to be close to one in a DD unless in smoke in which case you can cidatel the Atlanta with AP if its close but if the captain makes even one mistake and your are have mms hes dead.,WorldOfWarships,cu5ojgy,1,t5_2t8uj

4887220,0,t1_cuaj3lb,The default texture files are in rescontentgameplaycommoncamouflagetextures.    You can find there regular tileable textures that are used for the camouflages as well as default camos for prem ships that have them.  At first they look pretty weird because they are all red  green  blue on black backgrounds. If you have a ship with camo these textures get colored and applied on the base skins.    How does this happen?  For each ship there are multiple texture files gameplaynationshipltclassgttextures. One of them contains magenta areas hull sides superstructure smokestacks.... These are the areas that get textured with the camo deck windows on superstructure etc. dont have camo applied.  In order to know how exactly to apply the camo to the designated areas the game refers to camouflages.xml in res.    camouflages.xml file can be easily edited using any text editor.  The file consists of entries describing different ships. The XML tags are in regular English and you can Google translate the Russian comments if you cant figure out enough from the tags.    If you want to make your own camo first you need to create the pattern. I downloaded a Gimp extension to open  save .dds files you can find something that suits you best. When making the pattern you should make it tileable left edge should connect nicely to the right edge and top to bottom. For my dazzle pattern I used red shapes on black background since I needed only  colors. You can easily use up to  colors using red green blue and black.    Once you have the pattern you need to apply it to the desired ships. For example New Mexico is in the same camo entry with the rest of US ships except cruisers and Midway. You can edit the camo for all the ships by editing that entry or if you want to edit just NM take it out of the lttargetShipgt list and create a separate entry for it below copying the original entry and removing everything except NM should be good.  In order to change the texture change the path to the .dds file in the ltTexturesgt ltTilegt tags.  In order to change the colors used to paint the texture change the values in the ltcolorXgt tags. The colors are in RGBA format with all values ranging from  to      would be opaque black    . would be  transparent yellow.    Some more unconfirmed thoughts     When creating the RGB pattern using not  clean colors like    red the final color on the ship might end up being proportional mix of the given colors   If you look further down the XML file you can see how the entries for the unique default camouflages on premium ships are made. It might be possible to create a similar custom camos for an entire ship allowing you to make more features like false bows or wave wakes.,WorldOfWarships,cuakm31,4,t5_2t8uj

Yeah you could have  light carriers... but the other team has  fleet carriers that are as good if not better plus a whole extra ship.Speed for a carrier doesnt matter so much past  knots or so because theyre on autopilot behind the main battle line.

5074785,0,t1_cuxllav,There have been some changes to it though not in the way youd expect.  Originally if someone was hugging the blue line the torpedo guide didnt figure their direction and speed correctly causing many DD torpedo strikes to run long and miss.  By the same token the fall of shot wasnt easy to judge.  WG corrected this making it easier to hit an enemy thats hugging the line and correcting the issue with the torpedo guide.  They also noted that theyre working on some details which will make it harder to hug the line.Personally I think they should do something akin to what WarThunder does in ground battles.

5097474,1,t1_cv0dm9n,gtFuso was hit by aircraft and torpedos during combined operations. Big difference. Youre confusing your battleships. Fuso was sunk by three torpedoes from the destroyer Melvin at the Battle of Surigao Straight. gtKumano was sunk by US submarinesKumano had her bow blown off by the destroyer Johnston at the Battle off Samar. Crippled she pulled out of formation and her sister ship Suzuya stood by to render aid. The submarine torpedoes in part destroyed her replacement bow on the way to drydock for more permanent repairs. I could also add Samuel B. Roberts duel with Chokai however the latter was not severely crippled by the destroyer escort but rather an escort carrier. gtPommer went down at Jutland massive combined operationsExcuse me I thought we were playing World of Warships where we use ships from WWI and WWII in combined operations to sink an opposing fleet. Pommern applies. gtNor are they at all typical for power relations between individual surface combatants. Of course they are not typical. No destroyer was ever designed to take on a battleship in a v fight. No strategist made such plans. That was not my point. My point was they could in numbers. That is why battleships had secondary armament and escorts to deal with these destroyers before they could strike. ,WorldOfWarships,cv0fpei,1,t5_2t8uj

When you have a good broadside and a solid ish degree angle on BBs use the AP at a close range you could probably even citadel some of them the low tier IJN BBs especially. AP  shells will absolutely shred and citadel all the cruisers in your tier bracket. Always use HE on BBs that are angled DDs and low tier CVs they have very little armor at low tiers.Use your torps to turn other ships into showing their broadside or sink stuff thats gotten too close too you. The Furutakas armor and citadel are weak and easy to hit and you have crap AA so be very careful with your angle and watch for planes.

Setting sail to cause some destruction will be a full destroyer line including the legendary Izyaslav Gnevny and Tashkent the lead destroyer of Project  I whose cobalt blue color earned her the nickname blue cruiser. Soviet destroyers bring unique features and strengths to the fight. The hardhitting cannons deliver great accuracy making hitting even the fastest targets at long distance a breeze. Coupled with extremely high speed strong antiaircraft armaments and rapid turret rotation at higher Tiers these new Soviet vessels are capable of delivering devastating attack runs.    Were looking forward to letting players command this line of Soviet destroyers said Daniil Volkov World of Warships Development Director. Working towards new and interesting content to give players different ways to battle is a priority for the team and these upcoming additions will open up some distinct vessels for commanders to discover and leverage in combat.

5188955,0,t1_cvba8j1,Most ships are gendered female. One explanation for this is that in most IndoEuropean languages that retain noun gender the word for ship is female. Another is that it has long been a tradition for boatowners to name their vessel after significant women in their lives. Yet another is that ships were often dedicated to goddesses and later to women of national or historic significance bestowing a beneficent female spirit on the ship. Still another is that longtime sailors would come to love their ship and sometimes feel married to them making the ships female.FADM Chester Nimitz speaking to the Society of Sponsors in  said A ship is always referred to as she because it costs so much to keep her in paint and powder. RADM Francis Foley in Naval History Magazine in  had a longer explanationHowever there are exceptions. The Germans referred to the Tirpitz and Bismarck as male according to von MllenheimRechberg one of the survivors of the sinking of the Bismarck said that Captain Lindemann had asked that the ship be referred to as male because of its awesome power and up until the early th century Germans would refer to a ship as male or female based on the gender of the ships name. After that ships were generally referred to as she i.e. die Karlsruhe although if the type of ship were included in the reference it would be gendered according to the ship type  Das Schlachtschiff Bismarck neuter Der Kreuzer Admiral Hipper masculine Der Zerstoerer Karl Gallester masculine Das Unterseeboot  neuter Das Panzerschiff Admiral Graf Spee neuter. In most of the official records the pronoun was dropped  in Prinz Eugens war diary it would be recorded as ... Bismarck did X ... not ... der or die Bismarck did X ... Prinz Eugens war diary also when it contains gendered pronouns refers to the ship as male  Prinz Eugen hlt Kurs und Fahrt durch solange bis er abgedrngt wird  In more recent usage though ships are universally female so they would say die Bismarck die Tirpitz etc.In Russian however ship  is male and ships are referred to as he. This was not universal historically around  the usage was based on the type of vessel  galleys rowed were female and sailing vessels were male. However this distinction declined and ships are now universally referred to as he.Other languages carry the gender of the ship type back to the bare name. In Spanish for example battleships are male El acorazado and frigates female La fragata so you would say el Bismarck and could refer to the ship as he. ,WorldOfWarships,cvbgjth,3,t5_2t8uj

Any deviation from the basic blob or at least being close enough to it you can shoot at whats shooting them or vice versa is just helping your team lose.  The only time one would consider splitting off is if they spotted an isolated enemy within their range but not that of the blob and they can surely take it out or if youre in a DD that breaks for the cap after the mid pointish or if your team has sunk a good bunch of the other team.  The screening and BB defense capability of DDs and Cruisers is so utterly important in this game mode.  The sad thing is those players are used to going off on their own or splitting off with one or two other ships in regular mode doesnt work here.

5207306,0,t1_cvdntqw,That was just my playstyle. I found that if I played aggressively I could force the duels with other ships to be on my terms. I could encourage IJN cruisers to try to torp which let me citadel them before they could. I would scare other battleships into turning around which let me citadel them. I have even gotten enemy destroyers to torp their teammates accidentally rather than me.TLDR its a mix of tier and playstyle. Im aggressive and the Torpitz is the perfect battleship counter to a player like me.

The problem is that when your ship gets  knots and the rest of your team and most of the enemy team is approaching  knots faster than that your cover leaves you behind rather quickly especially if you spawn at the back of your team. Faster Cruisers can easily intercept a Battleship on its way to follow the rest of its team if said Battleships cruisers leave it behind.Your throttle has more than three fucking settings. Furthermore as a Cruiser your role is to provide cover for the BBs in the first place the exception being if theyre purposefully hanging back and not contributing to the battle.

5349405,0,t3_3oai1v,Cleveland has a particularly hard time hitting people at those ranges largely due to the fact her shells travel quite slow.I believe she also has a high firing arc which makes the shells easy to dodge.Practice leading and figuring out how to lead with angles and angle prediction. Space out your individual shots to get a better understanding of how the ship is moving and the shells are flying. Dont bother firing at a player that is actively dodging shells only very few if any shells would connect.Mind you that if you try spamming shells from km you make yourself a massive target.,WorldOfWarships,cvvg3cz,3,t5_2t8uj

5435751,0,t1_cw6g1ws,I cant claim to be any kind of shipbuilding expert but the Wikipedia link above has some explanations of it in the Origins section which is largely where Im drawing from.I perhaps stated things unclearly when I said that tumblehome designs were not designed to be stable when they lost watertight integrity  it wasnt that they werent designed to be so much as that they were discovered not to be for reasons of physics. As I understand it based on some quick reading the reduced width of the structure above the water makes it easier for the ship to roll over if water enters the ship on one side possibly because theres less inertia above the water and more width below the water which amplifies the force of the roll compared to a nontumblehome design. The RussoJapanese War proved that the tumblehome battleship design was excellent for long distance navigation especially when encountering narrow canals and other waterways but that it could be dangerously unstable when watertight integrity was breached. from the Wikipedia article above which includes a reference.The US Navy is currently building destroyers the Zumwalt class IIRC with a tumblehome design which among other things helps reduce radar signature so I assume that there are techniques which allow it to maintain stability when damaged. However those techniques may not have been suitable for ships designedbuilt in earlier eras or facing different weaponry  modern ships are much more likely to be attacked by missiles than by guns or even torpedoes I would imagine so the threat profiles they are designed to defend againstsurvive are likewise different than a WW era battleship.There is a modern paper comparing tumblehome with flared designs here if you want more detail.,WorldOfWarships,cw6gzmn,1,t5_2t8uj

5556213,0,t3_3r8dc2, SC and Kawachi are both awful. I personally had more luck with the Kawachi than the SC but I hear it varies for people. Either way theyre both slow and not a ton of fun to play. Myogi introduces the Japanese sniping playstyle. Its a rough ship to play in just because the turret inback configuration demands a lot of patience and perfect maneuvering for your shots. At least the speed is good  fast enough to keep apace with most cruisers  and when you do hit you hit hard. Wyoming is godly within its tier. Sure youre quite slow and your range isnt perfect  but six turrets on the centerline gives you some nasty striking power allowing you to reliably land hits at range or continuously hammer people up close. The HP pool is high enough you can afford to take some hits and once upgraded the AA isnt anything to laugh at either.

5756361,0,t3_3tzdzj,Tashkent captain here. Ive got  battles in it fullupgraded and  battles in the Kiev  WR amp  WR respectively  so thats my background in terms of qualification.    On the Tashkent    Less Range on the Tashkent Yes. It does have k less range than the Kiev. However take a look at your average engagement distance. Im willing to assume that nobody only engages other ships between .KM and only considers that to be acceptable. Personally I find that regardless of Kiev or Tashkent anything approaching km starts making me feel uneasy and  is the magic spot. So for me... the reduction in distance isnt so much a factor since my .km shots were kind of hope this works shots anyways rather than dependable hit strings. Yes everyone has better guns and hits harder... but that just means that you have to watch their turrets closer and pick and choose your battles more carefully... even at range.  Ship Size Yup.  Shes a fullbodied woman who isnt afraid of a little red wine with her pasta. Nothing wrong with that. Once again... you have speed that other DDs amp cruisers envy so use that to offset the size. Once again... speed distance and detectability can work to your advantage so use them.  Bigger turrets Yup. Theyre bigger too. And if you operate carelessly you WILL be punished. I find that I lose a lot more turrets in the Tashkent than I do in the Kiev. Once again... you just gotta be careful and respectful for the buttwhuppin the ship is capable of doing.  Module Damage Not sure about this one. I notice modules getting knocked out a lot as well but  of the time its because I overextended myself and got in deeper than I could handle... and that was the only time it was ever an issue. Nothing a little smoke or repair cant fix.  Longer Range Torps Yes. Theyre slower. REALLY slow. With nerfed damage vs. stock torps. But youre in a Russian DD... torps are a luxury item for you just something thrown in because they want your life to be easier. Aside from ambushing players around islands you know what theyre REALLY useful for? When someone pops up out of nowhere and you have to pop smoke for defense and you know about where they are but you lose sightvision of them you know... when its down to you and them for the sake of the match? and theyre hovering around you somewhere... just outside of k? Happens to me all of the time. Not sure where they are but you know they were last sighted about k away lazily drifting toward you waiting for the smoke to clear? Its AMAZING how x wide salvos of torps will usually connect at least once and often more than that... saving your ass.      So yeah... its not the same ship as the Kiev. Hell NO ship is quite like that. I consider the Kiev to be the Minekaze of the Soviet DD line... but at Tier . However I REALLY dont think its a letdown. Once again... like so many DDs it just requires an adjustment in play style. Its a tankier Kiev that allows you to take more punishment. At its speed I consider it to be a highly mobile firing platform for cap control and zone denial AS WELL AS a standalone pocket cruisercruiser killer. Personally Ive got about k XP on my fullyupgraded Tashkent and like the Kiev Im having a BLAST the entire time. Yeah Ill sell it to speed up purchasing the Udaloi but I wont regret a single match in this ship.    Edit Formatting,WorldOfWarships,cxamqls,5,t5_2t8uj

Sure you can have a cruiser at .km and get a couple of shots off but if you have an enemy DD from .  .km anywhere around you or an enemy spotter aircraft of flight group around you will be spotted. I had far better luck just firing from distance regardless of detection. I find that it is much easier to just fire from km and maneuver to avoid the return fire rather than play sniper. Damage output seems so much better when I dont have to add micromanaging my distance to target to the list of stuff to do while maintaining a bead on target.Not saying you are wrong just definitely not my play style.,WorldOfWarships,cxeyotf,1,t5_2t8uj

But the ineffectiveness of such fire was notorious WWII naval gunners often needed hundreds of rounds of ammunition to hit one fastmoving plane.The Navy used the fuze extensively in the Pacific theater it increased the gunners efficiency threefold in targeting enemy aircraft.

5929721,0,t3_3wkjy3,So Im just doing my thing trying to do ranked. Queue up join a battle MM did a semi decent job of organizing the team lets go.Fast forward  minutes and were at A capping and our Atago and  Hatsu get killed off and kill a Benson off in return. Ouch. I dont remember what the other team was doing at this point but I manage to get lucky and demolish a wounded pensa in one volley and almost die to an full health HE spamming Mogami.At this point we have me an Atago at k health a Yorck and an Amagi. On the other team  atagos and an NC still live. So me and the Amagi proceed towards B while the Yorck did his own thing. The NC was right on top of B and manages to obliterate our Amagi but not before I could launch torps and kill the NC in return. Now it was a Yorck and me vs.  cruisers  The Yorck dies gloriously since he attacked both of them leaving  Atago at  health which I take out with one AP volley. Theres about  minutes left on the clock and it was me and another Atago at around the same health as me. Spotted fire pray to RNGesus.We won!,WorldOfWarships,cxwx1o0,2,t5_2t8uj
5931594,0,t3_3wlt2y,Damaging a ship earns a certain amount of XP based on what tier the ship is and what percentage of the ships HP you take out.  Killing a DD with k HP and a BB with k HP will earn you the same amount of XP assuming both ships are the same tier.Capping capture points also gives you XP which seems to be roughly worth the same amount as killing a ship.Cap defense reset ribbons also give XP but I am not sure how much XP they give though it is considerably less than capping a point.Shooting down planes gives some XP also killing about  planes is worth about as much as killing a ship.I dont have exact numbers for you just explaining the logic.

It rolls Omaha and Pheonix with nasty citadels.  You can citadel pretty much any cruiser through T with it.  The guns are really the strength of it because of the range accuracy and damage.  Turret speed is also a bonus.  Ive been fairly successful facing a Cleveland with it.  Just have to play it right and take advantage of Cleves terrible bullet velocity.  You can dodge shots with relative ease outside k.  You just have to watch damage because your engines can be taken out quickly and the hull is made of waxed cardboard.  It plays like a DD on steroids.,WorldOfWarships,cy6n7db,1,t5_2t8uj
6007884,0,t1_cy697k3,The atago doesnt need to be stripped of repair that doesnt fix high tier CA gameplay. The problem isnt that the atago is broken I feel the problem is that every other CA is inferior. Giving even just one heal to all other CA would probably be enough to make the class more desirable in high tier and with the captain skill that could be  heals. Considering that all the other tier s have more guns than the atago this seems like a fair upgrade.I need to test AP in high tier in cruisers VS BB before I come to any other conclusions about them in high tier but I know nothing pisses a BB off more than having a turret destroyed.,WorldOfWarships,cy75xz3,1,t5_2t8uj

6030669,0,t1_cya38vr,Thats partially true.  In  the Navy struck the  Iowas from the Naval Vessel Register meaning theyd no longer be maintained and would soon be disposed of.  The Marines pitched a fit since there were no other ships in the fleet at the time that could provide them with that sort of gunfire support for amphibious landings.  The Navy compromised and put  back on the NVR in mothball status originally it was the Wisconsin and New Jersey then the Iowa replaced the NJ when she became a museum.  Finally in  they were stricken again the Wisconsin was officially donated to the city of Norfolk and the clock started ticking on the Iowa on whether shed be saved or scrapped fortunately the LA group stepped up and saved her.  The Navy stopped maintaining the Wisconsin at that point and honestly theyd already pretty much abandoned the Iowa to rust and rot out in the middle of Suisun Bay years before.The bit about the engines being fired up every few months isnt actually true too bad cuz thatd be awesome but even though theyre museums now the Iowa and Wisconsin are still in a semiofficial status thru at least  where they could theoretically be recalled and reactivated.  Because of that the museum staffs have limits on what they can and cant do no cutting holes thru armor plate for example even if itd make handicap access easier in some areas.  A funny story is that when the Iowa group started restoring her a few years ago and got the list of things they were restricted from doing one of those specified that theyre not allowed to use any of the equipment in the galleys to cook food.  Know what WASNT on the prohibited list?  Firing the  guns!  WTF USN?!And something that probably not many people know is that the Iowas and Wisconsins status isnt exactly unique.  Nearly any museum warship in the US could legally be taken back by the US Navy and reactivated if they really really wanted to even the poor sinking USS Texas because technically the USN still owns them and merely allows their respective museum organizations to maintain them.  The only ship this doesnt apply to is the Alabama because shes actually owned by the state of Alabama.  When she was put up for scrapping in the s the state outbid the scrappers for her so they own her free and clear.,WorldOfWarships,cya50dz,2,t5_2t8uj

6096883,0,t3_3z20vk,The main difference is Aobas concentrated forward batteries she can now fire twothirds of her main battery forward over her bow. This means you can sail at enemies straighton or steeplyangled and not sacrifice too much firepower while maximizing protection. If youre feeling particularly daring you can capitalize on her reasonably quick traverse rate and fast rudder shift time to flick your stern out to unmask your rear gun fire and then go back to bowon to weather return fire. Her torpedo launchers also dont have as good a forward traverse and can only be launched over the stern quarters of the ship so use them only when its safe or as a last resort since youll need to expose your broadside or your stern to use them.Other than that take the lessons and playstyle that worked on Furutaka and apply them to Aoba.,WorldOfWarships,cyinir3,2,t5_2t8uj

It cant bounce  inch shells pretty well from the front and has decent torpedo protection.

6297105,0,t1_cz5cfhv,From what I recall the Bismarck never lost her engines  she lost some speed while she attempted to escape to German occupied France but thats not what killed her. A British Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber scored a lucky hit on her steering gear jamming her rudder and rendering her unable to stay on course. The ship itself was unable to do variable steering via her screws and they were unable to get the steering working again.This effectively turned the ship around and allowed the pursuing British fleet to catch up and pounce on her. Due to her turtleback armor and the fact that the British attacked at short range her superstructure was pummeled repeatedly but they were unable sink her. Eventually they sank her hulk with torpedoes andor help from scuttling charges on the part of the Germans at that point the ship was clearly doomed.,WorldOfWarships,cz5er43,1,t5_2t8uj

Due to how wonderful matchmaking works i am in a team of mostly tier  ships and in late game i am the only destroyer alive in my team and the enemy has a mutsuki. Then i have a couple of clevelands bitching and insulting because why the fuck they are doing killing destroyers where are the other destroyers and so son in the cap area because the mutsuki neglects their ability to enter with well placed torpedoes. Just because I am a destroyer it doesnt mean that my role is fighting other destroyers. IJN DDs guns are absolute garbage in terms of rotation and such.

6312663,0,t3_422fm1,Dont HE spam just practice AP. You will start hitting citadels soon enough.Tips  Some ships you need to literally aim for the waterline. You can citadel a ship even if your shot lands in the water next to them. Citadels are either the dead middle of the ship or split and under the turrets. Sometimes both. Make sure your shots are landing on the deck or on the beltwaterline. Everything above the deck is considered superstructure and you wont get much out of it. Sometimes RNGjesus hates you. Especially American BBs. After some practice you will know if your salvo has a good dispersion on it or if you wont hit anything. Japanese BBs are fast. Some travel at kts so make sure you are properly leading them. Watch help videos or post a video of you struggling to hit one. We can help tell you what to change.  As a BB captain you need to a broadside hunter. If a ship isnt showing its broadside you have a very very low chance of citadeling them. Targets will often show you thier broadside if they think you arent aiming for them. So keep an eye out and dont feel obligated to stick to a single target.,WorldOfWarships,cz76h13,1,t5_2t8uj

This is just a tool that makes it automated and shows it to you in a convenient format. If you dont want to use this just hide your stats and dont use it.Its the players that are toxic not the mod. Toxicity should be fought by giving positive players rewards and by giving players more tools and rewards to cooperate. For example match speed with a ship or an ability to join formation with your teammates. The game already has autocruise and waypoints. Then just give visible rewards for AA kills for the entire formation. etc. Make the game so that it rewards positivity and teamplay and players will be positive and play as a team.And also I will be a happy user of this mod since I like to know who I can trust who needs my help and how hard I have to carry a game.,WorldOfWarships,cze9jd0,5,t5_2t8uj

But only Marginally better.You hit gold in the IJN line once you hit T.  The kongo is an amazing ship once its hull is upgraded.  Its brutal at first.  From there its all golden until you get to the Izumo.On the US side you get the New Mexico at T and shes a brawler and a beast.  Colorado at  isnt that bad.  And the NC is a heavy hitter with bad dispersion.USN  Up close heavy damage brawlers with good armor.IJN  Range and speed with slightly more delicate but still strong armor.Both can provide fun but I think IJN is good to start for someone new to the lines.Remember all BBs are not that great with stock hulls.  People get to Kongo and think it sucks.  They are making their decsision off of the stock hull.  Once you upgrade its a BEAST.

6386751,0,t1_czfkyb3,Welcome to US Navy bureaucracy .  Before around  when there were fewer overall ship types there were just B C and D for Battleship Cruiser and Destroyer.  After  things got a little more complicated as ship roles multiplied and designations changed accordingly.  In addition to just having B for Battleship there were also Battlecruisers BC or sometimes CC Guided Missile Battleships BBGM  never assigned and Monitors BM.  As such mainline battleships received the designation BB to differentiate them from the other types.Same thing happened with Cruisers and Destroyers.  CA Cruiser Armored was applied to heavy cruisers and CL Cruiser Light was assigned to light cruisers. CV Cruiser Voler  which is the French word for to fly was used for cruiser hulls that had been converted to aircraft carriers.  Destroyers were split into regular Destroyers DD and Destroyer Escorts DE  these were smaller slower armed ships designed for convoy escort and antisubmarine warfare  the RN called them frigates.CV has more recently been differentiated into a dozen different type  the most common of which is CVN for Cruiser Voler Nuclear  ie the U.S. Enterprise Nimitz and Ford class carriers.,WorldOfWarships,czflv12,5,t5_2t8uj

6457212,0,t3_443gj1,Dont ever give your sides to anyone and constantly make small heading and speed changes.  Unlike the IJN and German CAs you actually have enough armor to survive a bit at high angles and the gun traverse to shoot all three turrets at high angles. Use that to get behind cover or to open the range while looking for opportunities to nail other CAs sides.  Dont be afraid to spam HE especially at longer ranges or from behind cover.That said US CAs are in a bad place right now.  They suffer from the US gun doctrine of heavy shells and plunging fire  which is under modeled in WoW.  In real life it was very effective at piercing lightly armored decks.  In WoW everything revolves around the citadel and its MUCH easier to get citadels with flatter firing guns through the sides of ships.  That said the high arcs do allow you to spam HE from behind cover more easily which is cheesy as hell but effective.Hydroacoustic is quite viable with the lack of CVs lately.  Your AA is still good enough to be a deterrent and you become a lot more effective at hunting down DDs.,WorldOfWarships,czn7w3q,5,t5_2t8uj

The accuracy of the IJN guns once you get to tier  in IJN BB line is far superior to the USN line there is just no comparison.

6617903,0,t3_46bk74,The HUGE ABSOLUTELY MOST IMPORTANT THING you MUST know and do in an NC is use fucking HE at long range.  You WILL NOT penetrate anything past km  to be safe.  I routinely manage to set BBs on about  fires and knock out a ton of shit knocking out AA guns does a lot to help your CV.  Doing this Softening up before switching to AP when they get closer is huge all the while their AP is just bouncing off of me since theres no chance to penetrate....sure you might get some decent damage once in a great while with AP at max range but it wont be anywhere near consistent and those ships will all be angled anyway.  Plus slamming them with HE over and over again really pisses them off and makes them act frantic and panicky...and remember that your HE is a lot more powerful than the HE of a cruiser and should definitely get them to try to get away from you which is gonna allow your team time to cap or let them retreat and repair. Like others have mentioned dont skirt the edge of the map and snipe...you wont ever get a citadel because of the shot arc.  Pound them with HE and piss them off as you move into good AP range lt Km then just finish them off and by that point in a round most other ships will be close enough to just keep using AP UNLESS you go back out after another far out BB in which case switch back to HE til u close the distance.  Also get the rudder shift upgrade.  I constantly speed up and slow down because the NC is great at doing that and with practice you can make most BBs and HE spamming CLs miss those long shots they are taking because youre never going the same speed.  Its glorious.  The rudder shift will help dodge torps and help you swing back perpendicular to the guy that just shot a full broadside of AP at you.  Get in there and mix it up and brawl.  Its a ton of fun!  But remember to keep CLs andor DDs close with you to keep enemy DDs at bay  also your AA is AMAZING its got a  rating after the . update so use the fighter remember youre shit at range except for HE so a spotter plane is a waste and target torp bombers first then dive then fighters.  Shit just last night I was waiting for a Nagato to come around an island km away and he was full broadside and I crushed him for a k hit and killed him in one salvo.  Always remember the disadvantage of the shot arc.  It gets flatter at the Iowa so you can then go back to long range AP sniping.  ,WorldOfWarships,d03ujbx,2,t5_2t8uj

Its not literally the ability to win by just paying but rather the kind of advantage that paying gives you that cant be obtained otherwise.Right now Id argue that ships like the Atago are so much better than the nonpremium alternatives that all other things being equal a player will have more success with it. Thats what pay to win is.Captain retraining at high levels and skill respec are also controversial as free players are definitely put at a disadvantage.

6699579,0,t3_47cx9j,Standard battle is honestly really shit. I mean most of the time it isnt by chance but to play perfectly promotes boring as fuck gameplay. As an example  Had a game the other day where my team was doing pretty well.  I think we had  ships or so left to their three.  Then all of a sudden we see our base is getting capped and then we lost because we had no carriers and no one could get back in time. The reasons why that is frustrating The DD that capped it was unspotted the previous  minutes.  Its not like we lost a flank and failed to react... we won both flanks its just there was nothing to react too. This DD just took a wide arch around with no one scouting him and then went to the cap.   Even if we got back its still a shit show to try and hit him. He could smoke and basically just avoid being scouted until were actually inside the cap. So how to play around that?  Someone has to just sit back in the cap... but who the fuck wants to do that?  So as I said it promotes shitty gameplay where to play to win one person has to sacrifice actually playing the game for the first  of the game just in the offchance a DD sneaks around unscouted and starts capping. As for solutions?  Make it so you cant win by capping if the other point is in the process of being capped.  This way you force a fight. If one team has numbers they can keep one ship on the cap and send the others to clear out their base cap.  If there is just oneship on each team left and theyre both on the others cap... then I guess it would have to end in a draw and I still find that preferable to games essentially being stolen by DDs with k detection range skirting the outsides. Another alternative is to make it so people on your cap are automatically  scouted.  At least this way you can defend your cap from outside of it. TLDR  Standard is good most of the time just because people happen kill each other... but its a shit design that can lead to shit outcomes. ,WorldOfWarships,d0calyj,4,t5_2t8uj

Every time the make CVrelated changes to the game it either creates a new problem serves to exaggerate longstanding issues or both.  This time around the DB buff combined with the changes to manual drops from previous patches the size of USN bomber squadrons and the supersonic speeds of hightier planes has resulted in T USN CV with strike loadouts into a oneclick fiery massacre against well everything.  There is no dodging them due to their speed and impossible maneuverability  only RNG can save you. DD are in a particularly bad state this time around.  It was already bad enough that a halfdecent CV captain could completely shut down multiple DD in a match with impunity now its not uncommon to see one DB squad delete a hightier DD in a single attack.  Its not uncommon these days that I hop into a game as a DD and Im dead in the first few minutes because of this.

6754878,0,t1_d0hwkel,There is.It should be noted these are of two different ships. The first video clearly shows a triple turret without flash shields between the guns. The Royal Navy only used triple turrets for the  Mark I found on the Nelson class. The video of the second shows a cage that is not consistent with the Navweaps description for this gun. Based on these descriptions we are seeing the rear of a  Mark VII used on KGV which had very elaborate flash precautions perhaps overly so given the problems encountered during World War II. The clip of guns firing is a  Mark I. For the  gun the process was as followsgtPropellant bags were transported from their storage locations in the magazines on roller chutes into hydraulically operated cages that raised them to the handling room.  A and B mountings had four cages but Y turret had two.  Y turret had two doubledoor scuttles in place of the other two hoists primarily because of the reduced vertical spacing for this mounting.  In the handling rooms bags were manually rolled or slid over to open waiting trays from which they were then manually carried to cordite hoppers.  There was one hopper per gun on a circular platform connected to the hoist trunk.  Powerrotated scuttles and chain rammers transferred the bags to the lower hoist cage.  This cage had two compartments which each held two propellant bags half charge.gtProjectiles were moved from the shell rooms by overhead trolleys and then rammed over hinged shell trays through openings normally closed by watertight doors to the revolving shell ring in the shell handling room.  The shell rings for the quad mountings held  trays in four groups spaced  degrees apart while the twin mounting had  trays in four groups spaced  degrees apart.  The shell room ring could either be coupled to the ship or to the revolving stalk.  When coupled to the ship the shell ring was driven by a  bhp hydraulic engine that was connected via a flexible coupling friction clutch worm gear and pinions with allowance for eccentricity and a rise and fall of up to  inch  mm of the ring in relationship to the mounting.  When coupled to the stalk a similar hydraulic engine was used but the connection to the shell ring did not have any provision for eccentricity or relative motion. Editors note  This ring proved not to be flexible enough to withstand the twisting of the ship as it moved through the waves or made sharp maneuvers and was a source of jamming  Projectiles were rammed into the upper hoist cage when the ring was coupled to the stalk.gtThe lower hoists were operated by winches having two reel drums of different diameters on the same shaft which meant that the propellant and shell cages arrived together at the working chamber below the gunhouse.  Projectiles and propellant bags were rammed from the cages into traverses which ran on rails across the chamber to the gun loading hoist cage.  This was a three level container with the shell on top and half charges in each of the two lower compartments.  The hoist then ran up to the gunhouse at a slant such that the loading cages were at the  degree loading angle when they reached the gun breeches.  After the shell was rammed the cage incremented upwards twice as the half charges were rammed.The  description is less descriptive but goes as follows. gthese triple mountings proved to be quite troublesome during their early careers due to their complex design.  This complexity was partially due to the nature of mounting three independently sleeved guns but it was also because of the British excessive use of interlocks in the ammunition loading and supply systems and by the use of a large number of swashplate engines.  There were nearly  mechanical interlocks associated with the loading of each gun.  Although the antiflash precautions were good in these mountings the turrets still lacked flash shields between the guns.  gtIndependent shellbogies were replaced by three fixed shellbogies mounted  degrees apart on a shellbogie ring.  This meant that all three guns had to be loaded almost simultaneously with the loading cycle in the shell handling room.  The corditebogies were replaced by corditehoppers in the revolving structure which greatly increased the manual handling of the bags and thus the number of crew needed in the handling room.  gtEach gun was served by a pusher shell hoist and a cordite hoist.  The shell hoist delivered the shells in a bucket vertically to the rear of the gun.  The cordite hoists were a dual canister design powered by hydraulic rams with wire lift and pulleys with each canister holding three bags of propellant vertically.  These came up to the side and rear of the gun.  During loading the shell bucket tilted horizontally and the rammer went through the bucket to push the shell into the breech.  The bucket and cordite canisters then traversed and the first cordite canister was rammed the arrangement traversed again and then the second cordite canister was rammed.  All three then traversed back and tilted vertically before traveling back down for the next load.  There were about four ready rounds stored in the wings of the turret.  A radial crane moved the ready rounds to the loading trays for the outside guns.Minor edits.,WorldOfWarships,d0i0eog,1,t5_2t8uj
6757117,0,t3_48alq7,As annoying as longrange torp walls might be theyre not very accurate and they dont do much damage  out of a typical spread maybe one or two will hit.  If youre forcing the Shimikazes to keep to max range youre already severely limiting their ingame impact.  Doubly so if youre far enough forward to spot their torpedoes for other ships.If a Shimikaze gets fed up with sniping and tries to push forward... well youre faster than they are and youve got much better guns.  RU DDs have a hard time getting close enough without being spotted but RU DDs are more about sniping larger ships.Honestly the best counter Ive found is to try to think like the enemy.  This is especially true once you unlock the Fletcher or the Gearing since they have good range on their torpedoes.  If you know where the best stealth torp locations are you also know the best places to ambush a Shimikaze at close range.  Even if your ambush fails you deny them their best launch position.,WorldOfWarships,d0i8qpf,1,t5_2t8uj

Similarly you get worse AP than the Wyomings top hull which on a personal note I like because you overpen the low tier cruisers less but does mean you will NEVER citadel another BB under normal conditions a complete lack of antiair and worse rudder shift time.So if you want to call it unique in that you have to spend millions just to turn it into a slightly different looking Wyoming youd be correct. But thats it being a different ship that makes it unique because at the end of the day it is still a Wyoming.

7044400,0,t3_4c28jr,The problem with trying to pin down values on this is that credit income is usually very variable and what constitutes a great game to some people might only be a good game to others. Its useful as a general ballpark but across a large number of games I feel like its not useful to calculate grinding goals or anything like that. The comparison between the premiums I think just boils down to whether you are used to the gameplay at tier  and can bang out consistent games at that tier. This is why Murmansk is commonly recommended despite Atago and Tirpitz etc. being nominally better credit farmers in theory because not every player is able to extract kk prem from AtagoTirpitzTaiwan boatMikky consistently. I think T premiums except Atlanta e.g. currently Sims Blyskawica and soon Saipan should be a great compromise between the two. T games are pretty sealclubby while T games are not nearly as demanding as T games so compared to T premiums T premiums have a better time. Wish theyd make more of them a T BB that isnt rare like Warspite would be nice. Atlanta is just hard to make work for most players. Ts are also pretty great but I think the credit earning ability isnt that much greater than TsMurmansk so its iffy. ,WorldOfWarships,d1eu9ig,2,t5_2t8uj

7312075,0,t3_4fi17s,What it really comes down to is flexibility.The two sides off start off fairly even but as the Tiers increase the USN CVs increasingly lack the ability to exert control over the map like the IJN can.The USN simply trades larger squad sizes for greater number of squadrons and faster reloads. This means the IJN can keep more squads on the map and spread out over more of the map faster than the USN can respond.The USN may have  or more torpedo bombers in a squadron but the IJN has a damage advantage because they can take  or more planes split between two squadrons and pinch a ship into taking unavoidable hits that cant be dodged like the USN torpedoes can be.Furthermore the USN is more DB focused and the damage potential of these aircraft is a lot more random than the TB bombers.I think the problem the USN faces in CVs is that theyre flavored as AA and DB carriers and WG has really not figured out or liked the development of either style.,WorldOfWarships,d29c061,1,t5_2t8uj

Most of what I read about the ship before I bought it was about how tough and good at brawling it is but Im coming to realize that actually it is quite fragile but very agile.  So I think trying to play it like a very heavy cruiser might be in order which is basically what you suggest and closing only when there are isolated victims enemies later in the round.,WorldOfWarships,d2jeak7,1,t5_2t8uj

7523234,0,t3_4icvd2,Honestly with how WG has balanced things in the past do you really think theyre capable of balancing anything properly anyways? you also just cant balance off of player stats. Not all players play all ships. That can be because they havent gotten the ships yet they only played a handful of games and switched to something else or because the gameplay mechanics of certain ships didnt appeal to them. And herein lies a big issue. If not all players play the same ships let alone have access to the same ships should WG even listen when people scream for changes? because I feel like thats how weve gotten to the current state of the game. thats probably a really long winded way of saying No,WorldOfWarships,d2xcrxd,2,t5_2t8uj
7523608,0,t1_d2x2ck3,I think if people do well in a ship despite its statistical faults theres something there to take a look at one way or another but I do agree that average performance should not be a large balancing factor.I think that there are probably three numbers for player performance I would look at  top X bottom X and median.  If a ships top performance is significantly worse than its peers then something is wrong.  Its got something that gives it a lower skill cap or its unappealing to better players.  If the bottom players after adjusting for AFKers of one ship are better than their peers then theres something that can help worse players and even if you dont adjust the ship thats something thats useful to know.  Median performance can give you an idea of where the ship ends up in play without outliers altering the deal.So to tldr it I think that player skill should be a factor in balancing but certainly not using average numbers.

Russian Cruisers  Main gun power houses though tend to be fragile in the armor. German Cruisers  Good rate of fire decent damage but tend to be weaker in the AA and even armor. IJN Cruisers  Really good torps and speed with maneuvering and concealment.Keeping in mind this is just a generalization and does not apply to ALL the ships in each line.. but does seem to fit most of them.

7821075,0,t1_d3u8t2g,What did the USN know about Yamato and when?HighlightsgtCaptain Rogers successor Captain Harold M. Bemis reported in January  that Japan has under construction two inch battleships of considerably greater tonnage than  tons and is planning to lay down a third and possibly a fourth. gtAn October  message intercept referred to special type  cm ammunition and contributed to the USN thinking that these ships carried inch guns.  This was as intended by the Japanese who from the inception of the superbattleship program had always referred to the  cm .inch guns on the Yamato class as the special type  cm as a disinformation ploy. gtOn  February  two B reconnaissance aircraft overflew Truk taking photographs.  These were processed by  February  and one of them showed a Yamato class ship visible in one corner.  ONI photo interpreters at the Photographic Reconnaissance Interpretation Section Intelligence Center PRISIC at Pearl Harbor correctly estimated that this ship was armed with inch guns.  Shipdesign experts called in to consult estimated the ship at a minimum of  tons and noted that this huge size was necessary in order to mount nine inch guns.  However these experts then proceeded to thoroughly play Devils Advocate against their own position claiming such a design was impractical. In Dulin amp Garzkes Battleships  Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II we find two drawings of the class attributed to the USN during the course of the Pacific War.  The first is a crude and inaccurate drawing correct only in the ships gross features and attributed to summer .  The second is much more accurate and given as dating from March . I can confirm this from my own copy. The older drawing shows two barreled mm turrets and is quite crude. ,WorldOfWarships,d3v5kmu,1,t5_2t8uj

I often see statements regarding British and American radarcontrolled firecontrol being superior which is true without even mentioning other important factors. It is not like the Japanese battleships were unable to hit moving targets but rather that allied radarcontrolled firecontrol were able to track targets continually. If the Japanese battleship had a clear sight of its target then it should be able to hit it after some salvoes. I believe the Warspite could have a fair chance of winning due to its radardirected firecontrol but if the Warspite is unable to take full advantage of this then the Nagato would likely be the winner due to being an improved design overall.,WorldOfWarships,d3von1b,1,t5_2t8uj

Its got strong guns even tho they have a pretty lofty shell arc. The penetration angles are great allowing for easier citadels on angled CAs. Its bow armor is decent vs CADD but its got a huge citadel and weak armor so it is rather easy to pen if broadside. BB guns are able to pen and citadel at any angle so heads up if youre getting shot at by them. The AA is pretty decent.

7889605,0,t1_d42s4rl,I personally have DE on my Des Moines specifically for when I cant get into good AP range or when fighting angled ships. The way I see it you will always have enemy ships but not always carriers. DE is useful in all battles. With AFT you still only have  km max AA range and thats not for all of your armament. You AA really shines once the small caliber guns start firing up. As for floaty arcs its all about practice. You wont get used to them by not using them. I came from the Hindy then Moskva and I still have a higher average damage in my Des Moines which has infinitely worse ballistics. Its all about using them until you know how they behave just as with any other ship. I will note that in terms of average damage per game the Zao is king because of how good its HE is. However in a good DM game I have waaaay more fun. My highest damage game was in her only k damage which isnt a lot compared to what Ive seen other players do but it still goes to show what its capable of. In that game I got within secondary range of another Des Moines. I was bow on he was broadside. I deleted him from full health with at least  citadels cant remember the exact count.

7897419,0,t1_d43qb34,The SC wasnt much better. Utterly trollish dispersion at anything over  KM and the slow speed coupled with the atrocious rudder shift time meant that despite trying to not be a predictable target if I could see a DD in its torpedo range I was boned. To say nothing of if there was a TB carrying CV.And of course if you pick to go along the  line the entire enemy team will be on the  line or vice versa. But if you can close within the  KM mark to enemy cruisers then then you get to have fun. And it does get better. Really. Nothing beats utterly demolishing a CA with some close range citadels.

Even more when you are in a knife fight with other DD.Concealment is the way to go. It is not about stealth firing it is about not being perma spotted... A Khabs potting range is about k at which it will be perma spotted and focus fired.with full concealment it is . or  which lets you sneak up on things undetected and escape.However it is up to each to pick the right strategy.

8071680,0,t3_4prhe7,I still find the captain skill trees very basic and somewhat badly designed. You rarely have valid choices so mostly there is an optimal build with  maybe  different skills in it.Id be more happy if they gave it a complete overhaul but that wont happen as they already did it once. It changed a few things to be more balanced AFT but there are still very few valid choice options.A few things Id rather like to see more various skills choices of skill that enhance different aspects of for example smoke circles being bigger but last shoter  or they last longer and are smaller. Same can be applied to other skills. Longer lasting defensive fire vs shorter but with even more plane panic effect.

If they are distracted you can sometimes gamble a bit to get closer and hit them with AP. Gnevny isnt great against BBs due to mediocre fire chance and low volume of fire you want to be shooting DDs ideally then CAs and finally BBs.

8438994,0,t3_4v7mna,OMNI member here.. In my opinion SE is much better. Staying alive to cap and torp enemy is much better than starting  more fires per battle. I use SE on all my DDs except Khabarovsk.DE can work well in randoms but Id argue even there SE is better. The way I play with all DDs even IJN is that first I go hunt enemy DDs and once they are dead focus on the rest of the enemy team. SE helps me survive that first phase of the battle.. You can go for manual secondaries not worth it concealment kinda wasted on Yamato you want to get the enemy attention and soak the damage for your team and you dont need to get into position to delete someone like Montana does jack of all trades awesome will let you repair more often which is important because you should be the focus of enemy attention manual AA great except if there arent CVs in game or multiple lower tier skills usually vigilance. All the builds are viable even manual secondaries will work amazingly well once in a while and wont make a big difference. Pick what you like. I went with jack of all trades.As for modules definitely take main battery in slot  and rate of fire in slot . On slot  I went with secondary range because I like fireworks. AA range or accuracy would probably be a bit better in most battles. Slot  damage control slot  depends on your playstyle  if you go forwards and backwards a lot but dont steer much take propulsion if you steer a lot take steering if you feel you can manage without those take damage control. Slot  take concealment if you are going for CE build and torp acquisition otherwise.. Ognevoi is IMO a low point in the line. It gets better after it.  check this video out for how to play them.Same as with other DDs first I will focus on enemy destroyers. But since RU DDs have bad concealment and dont fight well at close range this requires some finesse and forethought. Follow an allied IJN or USN DD stay a few kms behind and when they light up the enemy destroyers shoot them. If the rest of your teams DDs arent doing their main job getting rid of enemy DDs try to anticipate where enemy DDs will be and use islands to ambush them. RU DDs are excellent at chasing and killing enemy destroyers they are just bad at finding them.. I think German CA is the worst CA line at the moment. They excel at deleting enemy cruisers who show side and are okay at killing destroyers... But not much else. Imo Hindenburg is the worst tier  CA and was the biggest disappointment of all cruisers for me. Go for them if you like their playstyle or care about them historically otherwise rather go for other cruiser lines.,WorldOfWarships,d5wew1v,3,t5_2t8uj

8445940,0,t1_d5x0htf,I never said it was amazingly fun just the most reliable to grind through those t USN cvs.Look at your options.Balance  awful damage awful defence. Out played by everything but your opposite.Strike  all offense and no defence. Your DBs are only really effective in a big group or staggered for burn. Your torp plans cant hammer and anvil. Any planes on the other side and ships focus your torps and your back to doing nothing.Air Superiority  enough fighters to lock down all other load outs of other ships torp planes. Your fighter squads are big enough with buffs to hold off  IJN fighters by themselves. Your two bombers allow you to DD hunt and finish off stragglers.You may not be the floating death machine that the IJN lines produce but you arent supposed to be. You are the defensive answer to those ships.Think of it like some of the CA or BB match ups. Some ships are better at defence than others. Some are better at attack than defence.  Trying to build a tanking AA nurnburg is pointless. I mean you can build one it just doesnt work very well compared to the cleveland at the same tier. Better HP better guns much better AA. Conversely as much as ypu might want to set up sneaky island ambushes with the cleveland the Nurnburg has much better potential with its torp load outs etc.I get everyone here hates Air Superiority. That doesnt make it invalid just not peoples favorite play style. Use the ship for what is is designed for and smash through the xp then move on to the next and dont look back.For what is worth hope the grind doesnt last that long.,WorldOfWarships,d5xa3lp,2,t5_2t8uj

Try to ask in chat and if no one responds see where the bulk of your team is heading and follow suit. Strength in numbers usually prevails.As for being in front or not depends on what ship youre in as well as who is around you. Youll catch on to a happy medium of being close enough to be helpful but far away enough as to not get focused.

8535558,0,t3_4wgu6u,Few things to considerUSN shells are fucking terrible.  They are slow and have brutal firing arcs.  At km they basically fire straight up and fall like rain....rain in slow motion.  Russian shells are not slow.   High velocity lightning bolts of death.   Awesome flat and wicked fast.  Russian ships are stupid fast.  Second to none.  USN ships have lower detection.  Few things.  USN being more stealth seems to matter for all of a second and a half.  Lets say the USN ship spots a Russian ship with a km buffer.  The Russian ship will close that distance so fast that the USN destroyer may have time to aim and get off one salvo before the Russian ship has closed the gap and spotted the USN destroyer.  The USN dd only really has the upper hand at km and under.  Once the engagement has started a Russian dd just has to angle and turn away and it can go from km to km in a blink of an eye.   At km a Russian dd doing knts is no easy target to hit with the ultra slow USN shells.  The flip side of this is the Russian guns can hit a destroyer at any range with ease.  Knife fighting can go either way really.  The Russians have so much firepower and despite having slower turrets they still turn at a respectable rate. The Russians armor is very good.  The Russian t destroyer is the best ship in the game or at least tied with the zao.  ,WorldOfWarships,d68iem1,1,t5_2t8uj

Imagine playing a pickup game at your local park and not a single person on your team says anything while your opponents continually exploit your openings. Does that sound frustrating? It sounds frustrating to me. Its a situation that can be avoided by simply opening up communication.Several things to keep in mind when and if you make that transition to a habit Youre playing in a heterogeneous team. Your objective isnt necessarily to get your entire team to cooperate but to establish communications amongst the several that will. Initiate communications immediately upon the start of battle. Its easier to speak prior the engagement than to speak during the engagement. That said a lot of information happens during battle so make it a habit to make reads and inform others of those reads. Competence breeds confidence. Your ability to lead will be influenced by your ability to provide reasonable and timely suggestions.Hope this helps!  ,WorldOfWarships,d6b3b2b,4,t5_2t8uj

You cant do anything about enemy planes when you play strike and you cant deal much damage when you play AS.The standard loadout strikes a balance between the two. It doesnt do either as well as the specialist in theory at least but it can do both. Sure Im not going to faceroll the enemy carrier as I would with two fighter squadrons and Im not going to farm as much damage off battleships with just one RNG bomber squadron. What I can do is fulfill all the jobs of a carrier at once like an IJN CV. I can punish a strike CV who didnt bring fighters because I did. I can outdamage AS CVs because I have TBs.My experience shows that the balanced loadout is absolutely an option.If you feel like repeating once more that it has less squadrons so its inferior without bothering with an actual argument and without trying to understand mine please spare us both the time.

There probably need to be other lower tier skills added to the carrier tree but it is ridiculous that every CV captain has practically the same build now that defensive fire made AA speccing your captain unnecessary.

8981768,0,t1_d7qmkqb,Ok lets make some corrections to the dribble you just got onto reddit. Kitting DDs sit out side secondary range stealth torping DDs can still do so without being detected.German BBs are good in close combat because they suck at range they dont take citadels but they take more pen damage then other BBs and are more prone to bursting into flames. They cannot ignore DDs as the only one with crazy secondaries and reasonable maneuvarability is the bismark which has terrible main guns the t and t are massive and the best they can do when torps are lauched is reduce the number that hits. As for torps only  BBs have them and  of those are prems and all of those have good but not amazing secondaries. Now if we were to be realistic then  hit from a BB would be enough to pop most DDs and they would still have citadels and they would not be able to kite or stealth torp cause those game mechanics and not things that happen in the real world.,WorldOfWarships,d7rgyz2,0,t5_2t8uj

9001336,0,t1_d7tgdpi,As a seasoned WoT player you get used to it we are the redheaded middle child for WG. Lacking the massive user base of the Russians which tends to get some very nice specials due mainly to the size and the fact the HQ is there so its easier to get an ok for a special as IIRC they are limited to only a certain amount of specials per year. EU also lacks the high money  player ratio of the Americans. Unfortunately the NA server is quite small so to counter this you find a lot more deals  advertising to incise in those whales.We are the inbetween at a level were everything is steady so no need for special treatment.This is not helped by the way things are laid out in the EU we are comprised of a lot of smaller communities divided by language and country so having collective events are a little harder to stage e.g. we all have different national events and celebrating every EU nations holidays would be way to much. This also makes it harder to have rd party events e.g. prizes for subreddit events as there are so many communities for different languages its just not realistically doable.Then there is that WGEU is regarded as quite lazy and incompetent and wont do anything they dont have to. their non existent stance on illegal mods in WoT is a nice example of this. I wont go one way or the other on this point they do have some very competent staff but I get the feeling their hands are tied by other forces.Finally a lot of it is conformation bias supposedly each WG branch is meant to hold X number of specials a year so it does even out in the end even if we only notice the bad. Supposedly .This turned into more of a rant then I wanted although some of my points probably could be more accurately worded they are fairly true and do pop up time and time again in these types of post. TLDR we do get fucked over somewhat due to a few reasons like population and multiple small communities although there is a lot of conformation bias too.,WorldOfWarships,d7ttkgv,3,t5_2t8uj

9006875,0,t1_d7uh41j,Hi I was just wondering if there are any plans to improve high tier cruiser gameplay in the near future. Tiers  usually encounter some pretty rough battleships that can rip them apart from very long ranges and very odd angles. Specifically one question I had was for tier  a lot of threads suggest that tier  cruisers should be given the repair party consumable to help lessen the power gap Have you already or do you plan to look into this? Yes there are such plans with direct or indirect changes. For now it is new modernization for VIII cruisers in .. direct and also BB plating nerf indirect. There will be more changes later.Yes we will probably try repair party on the future RN VIII and see how it goes. I feel like the USNs battleship secondaries are the least useful of all three trees right now. I know there was a range buff to them some time ago but the battery is still weak compared to the German and IJN secondaries. Whats the reasoning behind having the fire rate on the US  guns so much lower than their historical counterparts? Having the higher fire rate would go a long way towards making the secondaries on the US battleships more practical as their poor arcs and low fire rate as it stands now keeps it from being a practical option. You are welcome!The reason is that USN battleships are very strong in AA defence so their secondaries are worse.As a player I would spec my German BB in secondaries IJN in secondaries OR universal and USN in AA or universal. Bismarck feels a little bit too strong at the moment having very good long range secondaries and sonar makes it very hard for destroyers of any kind to deal with a Bismarck what are your thoughts on her state? Can you talk about what is happening to Team Battles? Will the St. Petersburg port disappear or will it stay permanently with changing cosmetics like the New York port? You mentioned that Royal Navy Cruiser line wont be released on .. so would it be a possibility that the alternate Japanese Destroyer line will be released first?  Is there even a chance that Kitakami could come back in any way? Anyway I suspect that last question will not get answered. Thanks for having a presence on the NA forums though communication with the devs is always good for any game . We dont have enough average player stats on her to say for sure but lets see how BB .. change affects the situation first.. Yes but I dont have much to say unfortunately. Were on different things for now including PvE boxes and clans. . It will stay. We put effort into it and players tend to like it. We see no point in removing it.. We will see. Both lines are likely to go through production testing after .. release.. Theres always hope...but if in any way doent mean without torpedo launchers in the amounts that make Shimakaze blush then theres little hope now. You are welcome. You have solid community here and Im very happy to be in touch,WorldOfWarships,d7uhhfq,2,t5_2t8uj

9011683,0,t1_d7v1qzt,I did angle after it proved to be ineffective to go bow on you cannot angle to far as you will take pentrating hits under the guns knocking them out and the belt armour isnt invincible on the bismarck either so you still take considerable damage.But that isnt my issue its the fact the mms cannot do any reasonable kind of damage in return because they do not overmatch.A north callie can happy  sail front on to your bismarck and the only thing he has to worry about is fires from your secondaries the mms bounce or do  overpen results.If you have played BBs long enough you know what to do I feel Ive played enough to know what do with angling in I hardly go bow on to the enemy but I  was finding k noncitadel hits coming in when I was doing the supposed correct angling and I could not return any meaningful return fire because the mms were bouncing most broadsides to the bow on north callies.To effectively damage the bow on north callie you have to pass it at close range and get your hits under its guns but that means you have to survive the minute or so closing distance while taking considerably damage without returning the same a mount your recieve.That isnt balanced thats poor design concept and if it goes live its a even poor design decision.,WorldOfWarships,d7v2b45,2,t5_2t8uj

9016131,0,t1_d7vgadr,This.      That is if you want to maximise the XP from the flag itself   The Dragon flag like all flags works off the base XP.  This is the number reported in the summary page of the profile tab when you are signed in. On that page you can pick an individual ship and it will give you this number for that ship.  You can see what is going on on the credits and XP page in the after battle report.  Have a good look at this and it will tell you what the effects of various modifiers is.As the reply above says the only one that multiplies is the premium account one. Even the premium ship one adds it is implemented via the camo modifier.So if you stack a  captain XP bonus flag with a dragon flag you get     of the ships base XP for the battle.  If you stack the dragon flag on a premium ship with a  camo bonus you get the same impact on the XP as a nonpreimium with the  captain bonus flag and the dragon flag though in this case the ship itself gets more XP though it is a premium so you dont careJust have a look at the screen try a few combinations and you will see for yourself.So  what to do?Well what I have done is work out which nationality I want to use the flag for then looked at my stats in all the premiums for that country and picked the ship with the highest average XP per battle  that ship I fly the dragon flag on as I use it to train up my captain for that nationality.

Its not glamorous like the tank and airplane but artillery IS the king of battle.Also the average GI was much better equipped and much better trained following the disastrous Tunisian campaign.   And we wont even go into the devastating affect of air superiority over the battlefield or that the US Army had much better logistics and logisticians.  The Americans learned some VERY harsh early lessons in the Pacific North Africa and Italy and they adapted brilliantly.  By  the US Army was probably the finest combined operations force of the war Arguably it was the USMC but it was a much smaller force  Closely followed by the the British and commanwealth forces and Soviets Army Study the Manchurian campaign.The Germans might have pioneered combined arms operations but it was the allies that perfected it.

9045292,0,t1_d7z2y6n,This is technically correct and historically they would have had lower penetration. The official designation was CPC and CPBC but this is effectively the same thing. However according to Navweaps these guns did use HE. In addition here are the definitions for CPC and CPBCgtCPBC  Common Pointed Ballistic Cap. British designation for shells with ballistic caps of  inch . cm and larger intended for use against medium thicknesses of armor. After  this designation was changed to SAPBC  SemiArmor Piercing Ballistic Cap.gtCPC  Common Pointed Capped. British designation for capped shells of  inch . cm and larger for use against lightly armored targets. Used a mild steel cap. Little armor penetration capability but large bursting charge. Obsolete by World War II. Thus CPBC is roughly analogous to AP as a  shell wont be punching through thick armor. If this was a national flair based on history I would expect these guns to fire HE and a very weak AP. That doesnt appear to be the case. Plus Wargaming has turned historic HE shells into AP for the game most notably with IJN DDs. ,WorldOfWarships,d7z3l9y,16,t5_2t8uj

I have a Montana went through Iowa to get there obviously and I have some other tier  crap so Ive seen plenty of high tier games.First off wow you really need to keep that battleship fetish under control.Second have you noticed literally not a single battleship above tier  is slower than  knots? Have you noticed they all have ranges in excess of km? You have literally no excuse to not contribute to the battle in a domination mode with the speed of hightier battleships and their range. If you just want to shoot at battleships and farm damage go make a training match and fill up the enemy teams with battleships and you can do precisely that without the repair costs.By the way if a BB player finds themselves constantly out of position due to shifting caps theyre not good.as a sidenote the sub generally uses the USN ship classification system where CC means battlecruiser think Amagi.

9076577,0,t1_d82q3sz,So I havent done ranked but Ive been reading trying to answer similar questions. For T I would go with the New Mex. Personally I really like the ship and if you know that it will be in a T game not a T game all the better. It has great guns imo and decent healtharmor. The Farragut and Ognevoi are also good choices imo. German cruisers in ranked Im not sure of. They rely partially on players giving you a broadside. This wont happen as much when you move up in rank and teams will probably try to focus fire your. I have the Hipper I quite like it too and will probably go with other ships more. For T I would avoid the Fubuki. Ive read that DDs in ranked should focus on being gunboats contesting caps. As you climb the ranks stealth torping IJN DDs becomes less effective because players are more alert and know how to dodge better. Also expect there to be lots of Bensons.

I still havent tested my CALs for the calibration on Dynamic Scope.I think they take the kts calibration from Notzer where they also aim at the Prow rather than looking where the shells actually land. In his video he shoots at a Kongo moving at kts at the th tick since his shell flight time was s however the shells clearly land between  ticks. Given dispersion kts still seem accurate for that video but again he was a BB in that game.,WorldOfWarships,d856ah4,2,t5_2t8uj
9096835,0,t3_54v4g0,Sometimes its the only viable option if you are facing alone more than one enemy ships all of them pointing their guns at you.  Option   Turn away  revealing your Citadel and get deleted by a few well placed shots.  Option   Wait for them to fire and then turn  hoping they dont have extra shots waiting for your citadel.  Option   Stop bow on and go on reverse minimizing your silhouette so that you take less damage and survive longer until help arrives or enemies switch to a different target.  The Dunkerque has exceptional front armor but very crap side one so its a valid tactic to stay bow on to enemies since all of its primaries are in front anyway.  That also works with squishy Cruisers that plan to stay alive for the end of the match although some can still be citadeled from the front but its still much better than showing broadside.  ,WorldOfWarships,d85ak8z,2,t5_2t8uj
9097722,0,t3_54vbkp,First off welcome to the Carrier Club! Here you will be forced to eat A LOT of salty comments from both green and red ships yet you will wield power that they could only dream of.Something I found useful was the Basic Carrier Guide by Aerroon for learning the very basics of CVing. I would recommend you watch it a couple of times as well as the Advanced Carrier Guide once you get the basic principles under control.There are already a few good tips on here specifically regarding manual attacks so I wont go over them again. That being said the best tips I could offer you are this During loadin look at the shps you will be facing. Study the enemy CVs Aircraft rating try to identify what you will be facing planewise more applicable from T onwards as well as the AntiAir ratings of the enemy surface ships. Know who your main targets are. As a Carrier driver the main targets you should go after are battleships. Tier  to  BBs are typically quite slow and difficult to turn. Furthermore their AA is not that great making them vulnerable to your strikes. Low tier Cruisers are also good targets to help your destroyers. But when facing T be wary of Defensive Fire. The above statement being made know what your strike limitations are. The IJN carriers almost always having multiple torpedo squadrons are good at hunting mobile destroyers. US carriers feature more durable planes which means they can withstand AA slightly better. Map awareness and prioritising is PARAMOUNT to your success. If you consider each launched strike wing as a salvo fired from a normal ships main guns you realise how limited the number of attacks at your disposal are. Make sure that every strike run you make is meaningful. NEVER stand still. This is a death sentence in the lower tiers. Try to stay with the main fleet of ships but far enough to stay out of detection. This allows for more rapid response when your allies need support as well as making it easier for your allies to help you in a difficult situation. This is a difficult one in the beginning but important to understand and implement. At the lower tiers the number of planes that you have in reserve is quite small. There is nothing wrong with being a little conservative in the early stages as long as you can significantly impact your teams win probability later on.Finally just go enjoy the class. It is a steep learning curve and you will become exhausted a lot faster than playing surface ships but once you master the class it will reward you for it.,WorldOfWarships,d85ee1k,3,t5_2t8uj

9130177,0,t1_d89a8zu,It has more to do with the way WGs Asia office is actually run or maybe not run than it does with the market theyre in.  WG has a pretty horrible track record of exploiting markets for the money they could be offering though.  They put huge amounts of effort into Russia with Europe being  ... even though NA makes them the most money overall.  However WG NA is pretty bad compared to WG EU and WG Russia.Its not even that theres no money in Asia  Im pretty sure even the Asian players from the poorest nations in Asia if they have an internet connection are at least as wealthy as most Russian players.  Meanwhile with the income disparities in a lot of poor Asian countries those Asians who are on the internet playing games are likely to have the disposable income to be buying ships.Given the big gaming thing that Asians have Asia could be making them a lot more money than it is now they just dont really choose to invest the effort itd take or WG HQ doesnt go and make the personnel changes necessary to make Asia office better.A common experience on the Asian server I play there at times with my JP friends is how toxic the chat is.  Great is it really that expensive you know with the wages in Asia to hire moderators to sit on servers and deal with the constant vitriol and hate speech?  Im sure theres enough bilingual and trilingual or more college students looking for money whod be willing to take a telecommuting job over the internet even if pays little.  Given how little uniformity there is between WGs regional offices Id imagine WG Asia could do something like that even if none of the other WG offices do.As for not understanding what goes on in chat  the grass is always greener on the other side trust me I play on Asia and NA.

9159895,0,t1_d8c9aud,gt AA of BBs have been buffed buffed and buffed and now its so retardedly powerful that x BB close to each other is immune to CV attack. Its ridiculous.This is about your only valid point. gt  The new eco changes were good for two groups Bad players and BBs. You get jack shit for spotting but you pile on the expcredits for tankingYouve got that backwards. You get XP for spotting now  you still get zero for taking damage. Also the new economy changes were geared towards average and below players  a big complaint about high tier was that only very good players could actually make money in high tiers  your average player was essentially locked out from T games due to the costs. CV is fucked by CV has always been fucked and frankly this changes nothing. CVs are a beast of their own because despite the popular perception they dont just hardcounter BBs they hardcounter everything. Buffing CV isnt the solution to the BB issue because that will just make CVs the new BBs but worse. gt  The rudder shifts on the BBs are stupidly fast and have stupid turning circles it was a buff that came long ago but in my mind it should never have happened and I think it needs a nerf. FFS there are cruisers with worse turning circles than BBs.On the whole BB rudder shifts are far longer than those of any other class except maybe CVs and with the exception of Warspite are on the whole larger than any other class again except I think for CVs. The buff youre thinking of was a nerf to IJN BBs and a buff to lowtier US BBs back when carriers were on the other side of the power scale from where they are now. BB maneuverability is on the whole in a good place but I think the German BBs are far too maneuverable while I dont think KM BB population is an issue I do think KM BBs try to do so many unique things it breaks the meta.gt  FFS there are cruisers with worse turning circles than BBs.Those are mostly in the Russian line and are about as long as a BB. Length matters more than mass in turning  a light but long boat will always turn worse than a heavier but short and fat one. gt The hydro on German BBs is just stupidly good why would you ever need a radar cruiser when you can just stick your adamantium bow towards the enemy and sail into the smoke. Torps? Fuck that when you spot them .km out its ezpz.Agree . Hydro and RADAR were antiDD consumables the BB and CAL communities begged for do Cruisers could do their jobs properly. I can think of no reason why KM BBs needed to get it or why they needed to get torps got that matter. gt  You can RNG fuck out every other class with a BB except BBs themselves.You can absolutely RNG fuck BBs.Besides what Ive responded to youre just running into the realities of naval warfare. Cruisers were fine on their own or in torpedo squadrons with DDs but in a line battle with BBs involved no Admiral ever expected their cruisers to stand up in the battle line  they were sent to either cut off enemy avenues of assault with torpedoes or counter that or finish damaged enemy capital ships. At the end of the day Battleships like all shipsoftheline were conceived in order to defeat lesser vessels something they were clearly successful at. In the context of WOWs balancing BBs and Cruisers is only a slightly finer line than balancing CVs. Push too hard and theyll be limp against Cruisers and completely unable to counter BBs their PRIMARY job  people tend to forget this far too often. Dont push hard enough and you have the current situation. Of course an easy fix would be to properly balance DDs but you cant do that without making DDs fairly homogenous across nations since proper DD balance means torp reloads are no faster than BB reloads and concealment and torp range are no greater than km.,WorldOfWarships,d8d31f3,1,t5_2t8uj

9282768,0,t1_d8sktlf,The GK as with most of the ships in that line is super forgiving though due largely to its armor layout combined with its excellent hydro. Its guns arent amazing from what Ive seen not better than either Yamato or Montana for sure but the average player will straight up survive longer in a GK than they would in a Yamato or Montana simply due to pretty much never getting citadeled.The Belfast doesnt really have that going for it. Yes it is very stealthy for a cruiser. Yes it has smoke. Yes its agile. But. Its very lightly armored the smoke makes a very small area of concealment it doesnt have torpedoes and in fact it generally has virtually no way of generating Devastating Strikes against anything larger than a destroyer.Most players will do mediocre damage in it and will either eat torps while sitting in their smoke or just blind fire I can hit the center of a single puff of smoke pretty reliably or will make a turn at the wrong time or not make a turn at the wrong time... and eat massive damage from heavy cruisers or BBs. Meanwhile they wont pull off Devastating torp salvoes or massive damage AP salvoes and even if they survive for a long time due to stealth they simply wont be delivering huge quantities of damage due to not knowing how to exploit DC cooldowns and intelligent use of AP at good angles.In short  I think the ship has a high skill ceiling... but a fairly low skill floor. An OP ship would have a high floor like the GK where its easy to do damage and succeed in it more or less despite skill. The Belfast from what Ive seen is quite the opposite.Good players will absolutely murder teams in it poor players will simply be food for better players or bigger ships.

The latter has been shown over and over to be a great short term source of revenue for a FP game but in the long run it generally only winds up causing average players to become angry and frustrated then leaving which causes the player base to drop off because whales are only a small fraction of any given playerbase. When that happens the game goes to its death bed.Sometimes it starts out blatant from the start and sometimes its a creeping problem that grows over time a virtual slot machine that you can spend real money on for potential game advantages is generally a sign of the latter. ,WorldOfWarships,d8xdul3,2,t5_2t8uj

Your enemy will just create missiles or torpedoes with enough brute force to simply crumple the ship. You want armor? Throw away all your stealth capacity. You want both? Its called years of RnD and a shit load of money.Ships are big targets especially battleships. You dont need a battleship to carry huge payloads of weaponry when you can split the number up between smaller ships therefore making more targets for the enemy to concentrate on making AEGIS for example much more effective.Long range fire support is not a valid reason to justify blowing all this money into ships that will play a niche role we have plenty of platforms for fire support.Battleships are gone for a reason.,WorldOfWarships,d91nx27,2,t5_2t8uj

Due to the nature of the ships they really seem more like ships for experienced players so it might turn out that theyll be mostly avoided by the regulars that would be made better by them. In fact I liked calling the lowtier spam Black Swan matches especially hightier gameplay emulator because it seems like a good way to teach bowin and only showing sides if youre not getting shot at. ,WorldOfWarships,d9314c5,5,t5_2t8uj

9384274,0,t3_594fi7,I transcribed the interview if youre having trouble with the British English or firewall wont let youClaire Bowes  CB ReporterNorman Scarth  NS IntervieweeAdmiral Bruce Fraser  ABFCB Its the th of December . The Allies have had a good year Italy has surrendered and the Soviet Union has defeated Germany in the battle of Stalingrad but the Soviets are relying heavily on vital supplies from their allies Britain and America. Convoys of ships tackle some of the harshest conditions in the world to bring munitions to the far north Russian ports of the Arctic Circle. Norman Scarth just turned  is on board a British naval Destroyer HMS Matchless.NS I joined the royal navy as soon as theyd allowed me to.  and a half. All I wanted to do as we all did we wanted to beat Hitler. That was all that was we wantedCB His first chance to beat Hitler comes in the freezing dark Arctic waters. HMS Matchless is part of a British force protecting a returning convoy from the Germans. With subzero temperatures constant storms and huge waves. It was a stark induction for a novice like NormanNS Like Nelson I was a poor sailor from the point of view of sea sickness and sea sickness as anyone knows you wish you were deadCB On Christmas Day HMS Matchless was told to change courseNS We were ordered to leave that returning convoy and join another convoy because it was rumored that the Scharnhorst was out and the Scharnhorst was greatly feared She was the most successful fighting ship of any navy during WWII. She had a reputation and she deserved it. ABF Hitler was getting very agitated about the Russian convoys going through.CB The Commander in chief or CnC of the whole operation was Admiral Bruce FraserABF In  AM came the signal from the Admiralty. Saying that the Admiralty believed the Scharnhorst was at sea.CB Admiral Fraser was ready the Scharnhorst did try to attack the convoy but she was fought off by three British battlecruisers. Then as he later told the BBC he decided it was time to confront the great German ship and finish her off. ABF When we decided exactly the time that it would start it came out to about  I think. And so we discussed whether to have tea before the battle or after it. We had tea before the battle.CB The  thousand ton Scharnhorst was said to be quicker than any other battlecruiser and was beating a hasty retreat away from the initial clash. But it was no use she didnt know it then but she was already surrounded by  British ships including HMS MatchlessNS It was boxed in there when we finally met up with the th cruiser squadron and the Scharnhorst. She then didnt want to engage in battle she was only meant to sink the convoy when she got the chance. Shed been ordered not to challenge major forces. So she set off abandoned her mission and set off for the Norwegian Fjord which was her base and her safe haven.CB So she was heading homeNS She was heading home for safety. We shadowed with the use of radar and our radar was better than the Germans. We knew however that she was heading straight towards HMS Duke of York another force with a commander in chief on HMS Duke of York a battleship with  inch guns. We knew that the Scharnhorst didnt.Sailor on Duke of York My job is to fire the guns of the port part of battery. After waiting what seemed to be an endless day was sunked about being in time to catch the Scharnhorst. We got target at  just the time the CnC calculated and we were all set. Jerry was caught with his pants down our guns firing aft. The target was soon illuminated by a star shell. And in a few seconds and crash our  inch guns sent death and a broadside to the sneaking Jerry.CB The Scharnhorst had been taken completely by surprise as the British ships closed in on her.NS All of the ships if you like met up there. So then it was just all hell broke loose. Although it was pitch black it was lit up bright as day by star shells. Like fireworks providing brilliant light. Illuminating the area like broad as day.CB So its evening boxing day the star shells have lit up Scharnhorst. You see her for the first time what does she look like to you?NS Magnificent and beautiful Ive described her as the most beautiful fighting ship of any navy. She truly was and fires aboard her then. It was the most wonderful magnificent ship and firing with all guns still available to her. She had  turrets   inch guns.  by  they were put out of action.ABF When we got up to her I think about half a mile  mile she was half over and she was fires about. Fires all over the place. And it was really unpleasant having to go on shooting her. We didnt know whether shed surrendered or what shed done. But we had to sink her unpleasant as it wasNS As we were steaming past at full speed a mm cannon was firing tracables from the Scharnhorst now mm cannon was like a peashooter compared to the other guns and it could have no part in this battle. But it was just a gesture of defiance from the sloping deck of her. Thats one of the thing that remains in my memory they didnt hit all the destroyers they didnt hit us. It was a futile gesture but it was a gesture of defiance right to the very end.Sailor At about  the remaining four destroyers Musketeer Matchless Opportune and Virago attacked with torpedoes a number of hits were obtained and the Scharnhorst capsized and sank. Although we couldnt see it at the time because of the amount of smoke haning over the area.NS We came to the end of our torpedo run and Holf told us to come in again to fire the torpedoes from the port side but at that point for some reason it went pitch black with the Star Shells finished and I presume possibly also the Scharnhorst had been sunk the fires aboard her had gone out and Scharnhorst was nowhere to be seen. So we slowed and we hooved her and we soon saw many men floating in the water most of them dead. Face down in the water but some were alive so we switched our searchlight on believeing her to be sunk. And we saw these men and our captain called out he needed to be SURE that she was no longer a threat to us I remember him calling out to the men in the water SCHARNHORST GESUNKEN? and the reply came back JA scharnhorst gesunken. So we threw scrambling nets down and ropes and began to haul these men aboard we had picked up  of them  saved all total out of nearly  men. And then we received an order from the CnC Join the Duke of York and escort her back to Murmansk. So we switched off the searchlight pulled up the scrambling nets and steamed away. Still hearing voices calling from the black of that winter arctic night. Calling for help and we were men to certain death within minutes. CB And what did you think when you realized that the boat was leaving?NS It seemed a terrible thing to do AND it was! But terrible though it seemed it was the right thing to do. If we had stayed there a moment too long we were a perfect target for the UBoats in the area. And if we stayed a moment too long we couldve joined those unfortunate men. So I can hear those voices yet and I grieve those men everyday of my life. ,WorldOfWarships,d95itov,35,t5_2t8uj

Balance between types needs to be addressed but so far that process has not been working IMO anyway so a bandaid like team comp might help kick the meta in a different direction while the balancing efforts proceed.Youre right about small games but I think that would be fairly shortlived as the players shift back towards cruisers. I know I would play CAs a lot more if I didnt feel like a piata most of the time.Of course part of my views are colored by the notion that cruisers are intended to be the generalpurpose and most numerous type.

Settings gt Game Options or whatever the third tab is gt Detailed ribbons tickbox. Overpens will be shown as a shell punching through two plates.   You have the very general guide there though some shipsgunsinstances where there are special exceptions such as overmatching. CLCA use AP on battleships only if you can hit superstructure or you have a broadside target else youll bounce see early R.N. cruisers. DD can use AP against broadside cruisers and sometimes BB superstructure. BB use HE against angled BBs.   Dont hope to get a detonation since its mostly R.N.G. that decides it you can detonated anyone  including BBs  with a nonhit splash in the water with HE because of a unlucky roll. In general lighter armoured ships struck with HE suffer the most. AP can cause detonations very rarely with magazine damage but again R.N.G. has to guide your shell there.   One fire in a BB is no problem because  of fire damage is repairable.  or more is not and will hurt quickly. Flooding andor multiple fires should be controlled as quickly as reasonable possible if it doesnt appear another D.o.T. strike is soon coming such as dive bombers hitting you and then another set  seconds later or torpedo bombers  you get the idea. Fire in particular can and will be a bastard if theres a cruiser or two around that you cant nail because they will set you on fire again and again after your control runs out except R.N. because reasons.   Yes very although someone below just said no so take this with a grain of doubt. Also make sure youre in PvP and not PvE because bot games give very reduced rewards.   Omitted because I have no firm opinion on stats.   Its situational and depends where they are fired from and the DD captains playstyle. Also if its torpedo soup or not.

9484296,0,t3_5anuva,a lot of people will say things like youre just tilted take a break and come backbut what Ive found helps me when Im off my game in other gamesNot this one... I dont get tilted very much in boats because its so relaxing is to just consciously slow my roll a bit. When youre upset and you just know that you can do better frustration usually makes you try to do everything that you know you can do just to prove to yourself that youre still able to do it. In doing so I find that I tend to gloss over a lot of little things that I normally wouldnt miss. For example when playing a fighting game sometimes Id be upset because I missed a combo that I know I can hit. I try to do longer combos and start fishing for starters because deep down I want to show my opponent that damnit Im not some scrub who cant even finish whats on his plate! At this point Im not really paying as much attention to whether its a fundamentally good idea to hit that button and so I get counterhit and I look like a scrub who cant even tell when its time to just hold that blockstring. Slow down a little. Doublecheck your lead look at your positioning again take another look at what your team is doing and whether youre lonewolf suiciding and dont get caught up trying to prove to yourself exactly how unicum you are. ,WorldOfWarships,d9i564r,17,t5_2t8uj

9559777,0,t3_4xvv9i,One of the main reason why high tier IJN CVs are considered superior than USN CVs is because they can crosstorpedo DDs in early stage of game which have highest potential to carrying the game next to CVs. You are stating that Essex has edge over Taiho because it has stronger fighters thus after wiping out Taihos fighters in a few runs theoretically it can deny Taihos attack most of the time while Essex can continue strike on his own. However in real game the game is heavily decided in first  runs either you losing or winning and Taiho has great edge over Essex in that matter. Also even if Essex wipes out Taihos fighters it is still quite difficult to block all taihos incoming attacks because you do not know which way he is coming from. Not to mention Essex fighters do have to go back sometimes to refill their ammo and Essex cannot stop Taihos attack during that time.  ,WorldOfWarships,d9rft2k,1,t5_2t8uj

9579474,0,t1_d9tqy4x,In response to you edit Bismarcks outdated distributed armor scheme actually works against her in this battle. Since KGV can fling more shells of lower penetration and since Bismarck has armor on nonvital areas of the ship that armor can trigger the fuses on those  inch shells which already have large bursting charges.Bismarck has a . km range advantage however the likeliness of Bismarck getting the first shot is low due to superior British FCS and radar.We have seen from Bismarcks final engagement that her armor scheme was ineffective with her being knocked out of combat operational status quite quickly. Hell Bismarcks weak deck armor is vulnerable to  inch plunging fire out to  yards. Also the torpedoes are unknown since we dont know how much it affected the ship. What Im trying to say is her layering of armor and especially armor in unnecessary areas is a problem for Bismarck such as where POW holed Bismarck during the Denmark Strait or when KGV blew through the upper citadel belt of mm and exploded in the ships after canteen killing  men.,WorldOfWarships,d9tv6kk,2,t5_2t8uj

9582014,0,t3_5c79xn,The Friedrich is basically a bigger Bismarck.I would swap to concealment and MB. For the German T BBs like the Japanese T BBs the biggest asset of the ships are the guns. Maximise the guns and reduce the damage you take so you can dish out more damage. Hence concealment and MB.I made a specific Bismarck captain to run secondaries since Im keeping the ship and I have a stealth Tirpitz captain which Im waiting to transfer to my Friederich once I unlock it.A lot of people tell you not to snipe in German BBs but honestly its better that you snipe for the first  minutes as ships move into position and some of the flame throwing cruisers thin out. Let someone else tank the damage lol. Once the game advanced you can push up and get closer to the enemy which is far easier when running concealment.,WorldOfWarships,d9u6g85,5,t5_2t8uj
9582219,0,t3_5c79xn,I dont know what MBM or GFCS is but Im using the module that increases RoF and decreases turret traverse speed.

At this tier I find secondary builds to be quite gimmicky and does extremely little. It works well for the Bismarck because it fights at a lower tier.That being said though I have AFT of course and the module that decreases secondary dispersion.

9649604,0,t1_da1tguk,Lol.I dont know why people dont believe me. Its not even a contest.Maybe people think that a brawl in a BB requires km or less range? Brawl in a BB starts at  km range IMHO. Basically any range where you can land  of your shells in a BB is a brawl. guns and secondary daamge isnt enough against bow or stern of NC it just isnt. The  guns on the NC have stronger HE and he can fire all  guns. The bismarck either has to show broadside and eat k damage per salvo OR he can stay bow on and only use the  guns.I am sorry but   guns is inferior to   guns and the bismarck just cannot compete damage wise so you are absolutely wrong.The only reason you THINK you are right is that if you get to something like km range and manage to get broadside to an NC or if he is too potato and is full reversing and cant maneuver than yes. A broadside bismarck will beat a broadside NC in a DPS race. If this happens it is  the fault of the NC this means he fucked up because this is  avoidable.An angled NC vs either angled or broadside bismarck is a hilariously one sided fight.I know you think you are right here but it just isnt true. The Bismarck just isnt as good at brawling BBs as people think it is it is just that there are SO MANY POTATOES that the vast consensus is that it is.When I play NC I literally laugh at all the Tirpitz and Bismarck captains because I am basically immune to their damage. I dont laugh at Amagi because Amagi can still fuck me up. I have NEVER been outbrawled by a tirpitz scharnhorst gneisenau or bismarck in v while in NC whereas I HAVE been outbrawled by an Iowa simply because he had higher RoF then me and  shells.In fact yesterday I went v me and div mates in NC vs  bismarcks and a tirpitz. They got wrecked and we lost one NC but not because of the BBs.I dont think Bismarck is weak i really REALLY dont. I just think that what it is strong at is playing aggressively into capture points because of HYDRO. It also has much better AA than Tirpitz so IMHO Bismarck gt Tirpitz even though Tirpitz is the better brawler because of the torpedoes which can be used to kill a Bow on NC because he cant run. I just cant stress enough that you dont need to be bow on to tank  shells though. You can be stern on and angled and that is basically good enough and doesnt allow a German BB to get a broadside on you by rushing.I play with some of the top players in the server and albeit I dont consider myself to be quite the same caliber as flamu buisness ect. I consider myself good enough and with varied enough experience in the game to know what I am talking about and also to be able to filter what is good  inaccurate when it comes to youtube commentators. I dont always agree with popular opinions on this forum or the wargaming forums because popular opinion is often times wrong and it is kind of sad that people dont go through the effort of testing it for themselves and properly learning all the ships so that they have an informed opinion.I trust the opinions of myself Flamu Buisness RhinomkII Merrilz CrazyKole Aaroon CVs only and a few others.

Daring proper can work at tier  where she would be a slower Gearing with slightly better guns and slightly worse torpedoes. But with only a single launcher there is no way Vampire can work at tier  but using the upcoming Akizuki as a guide we can see her as a tier  premium.

9731707,0,t3_5eigbj,No there is no Rule. If by go premium you mean spend money on the game no. Every single tech tree ship and everything important to the game can be bought with ingame money and currency. Also dont get premium ships until you have at least reached the ships teir in that class and use it for Captain training credit gain. Premium time makes the grind part easier but still Playing a little and getting EXP will get you just as far just cheaper in the Money sense. It also lets you get more experience with the ship rather than just blowing past it. No need to go premium.Also a quick note on premium ships ask for advice before buying as many people here have them and can give opinions useful tips also if it fits your playstyle and will be fun to play. The reasoning to play up to wanted premium ships teir before buying it will prevent you from being a wallet warrior. Hope this helps,WorldOfWarships,dacn8og,3,t5_2t8uj

Though they could op for a standard  round and not a super heavy round.  The Iowas  historical super heavy round gave it comparable firepower to the Yamato and it could still fire more common  rounds in addition to it.  So the Iowas would not need its own specialized production line for all of its ammo needs.  The super heavy  round had similar mass to a standard  round and the experimental  experimented with super heavy  ammo. Which would be overkill.In real life the  were the better pick overall as they had pretty much the same firepower without requiring anything special.Overall I think they could of made it work if they went with standard  ammo.  The Montana on the other hand would of been able to get super heavy  ammo to work for it but that would of been overkill so the design opted for  rounds.Basically real life did not have these overmatch mechanics and a BB fight really would come down to whoever landed the first good salvo crippling the opponent.  Faster firing easier to produce  rounds which were still powerful enough was the way to go.TLDRDepends on if they are trying to fire Standard  or Super Heavy  ammo.,WorldOfWarships,dak9ssj,4,t5_2t8uj

To get an Inactive participation ban you have to have a pattern of many games where you were loaded into battle and inactive or many games where you did the exact same actions i.e. botting. The threshold for it is pretty high too.Note that player reports dont automatically result in a ban. These game bans are handed out only after GMs view your past games.gtI just want to say can Wargaming ban a customer account without any persuasiveness reason or any reasonable explain? I think absolutely NO!gt...gtFurthermore if the player really break the rule and acting like that Unsportsmanlike conduct  Inactive participation in combat.

The best way to ram is to ram your bow into them it doesnt really matter where. To ensure the kill and make sure they cant escape a ram from the side or front is best.

9885061,0,t3_5gxq3v,I played the Yugumo a lot in the past few days to make the most of the permanent camo until they take it away. Before that I was basically a BB player and I hated playing cruisers with a passion. And I really liked playing CV but they are sooo frustrating.So my opinion on this its not true. I have a very aggressive playstyle no matter what I play. And even at higher tiers I have rarely any problems playing BBs. DDs shooting torpedos at me? I either I know they are comming for me and I adjust my curse way ahead of them being spotted or I spot them miles ahead and at most eat one torpedo. And that is mostly because I was stupid enough to drive in a straight line for an extended amount of time.On the other hand playing the yugumo... I REALLY had problems hitting something with my torps. If I get to close to the enemy there are BBcruiser launched planes CV launched planes hydroradarsonar or just other DDs that will spot me. And if I am spotted I am pretty much dead.Then about cruisers... I can delete cruisers in my BBs from km away sure those are rather lucky shots but they happen. km that is quite often outside of the range of any other ship besides other BBs so I am safe from receiving their dmg. Sure you might say their fault for going broadside but at some point you have to go broadside or else you would be running away all the time or the worse thing... heading straight into the enemy team for that matter.Fire is the only way cruisers can do good amounts of dmg... that can then be healed up... yay.And CVs... except for IJN ships I dont care about CVs... Their damage isnt that big if you dont eat every single torpedo and planes are getting shot down like flies by all the AA around. I even stopped playing CVs because its just no fun to face so much AA without being able to do anything about it.The actual problem is how the game worked for a long time you sink you pay a huge repair bill. Now that changed  but players dont change that fast  they havent readheard about the change so still think staying alive is the best  there are still a lot of people who just run away in order to stay alive  as long as this doesnt change people will keep sniping.And even if there is one guy pushing... people are scared  first enemy spotted? time to turn around! If there is someone not turning around better for me because they wont shoot at me in the meantime.,WorldOfWarships,daw1p93,6,t5_2t8uj

Being able to slip in and out of spotting for even  seconds at a time is a massive advantage especially since Yamatos best range is in that km area.Concealment Yammy is km. Thats actually LESS than Moskva km. The ability to maneuver unspotted is extremely powerful for Yamato and it makes concealment build easily the best build for the ship.The other options are secondaries poor because Yammy is a poor brawler with the issues with the  turret depression and bad turret traverse and antiair poor because Yammy has poor antiair even when maxed. km concealment is much much stronger than the other  options.,WorldOfWarships,db2n64y,3,t5_2t8uj

A shot that only deals  damage but can score penetrations for  frequently easily beats a shot that deals  damage but has to go for  damage overpens all the time because it fails to penetrate belt armour under most realistic gameplay scenarios.

If you are focused on a casual audience though then the changes youd have to make for good competitive balance could really hurt your goals.  Wargaming is going to have to decide how serious it is about WoWs as an esport.  Currently they dont look very serious.For example almost everything in the new IJN DD rework is wrong for competitive balance.  Torpedoes need large buffs to compensate for torpedo hit rates declining as player skill increases.

And later on in the match there are often times when Im on one side of the map going full steam trying to help allies or defend a cap on the other side  the spotters range boost is highly useful then too.    In all honesty Ive never seen the catapult fighter actually help me against CV squadrons.

Thats how its supposed to work man.  Putting in high damage while the BBs tank is part of how a cruiser carries.  Other ways you can carry include neutralising enemy air and neutralising or eliminating enemy DDs.  Cruisers and BBs have a symbiotic relationship.  Their job is to protect you by tanking all the hits for you and your job is to protect them by keeping planes and torpedoes away.  If youre in a position to do so then you should also give your friendly DDs some fire support in the opening minutes.  You have the power to decide a cap fight and so influence the way the game plays out.  ,WorldOfWarships,dbet2jm,1,t5_2t8uj

For me the reasoning is that the Tirpitz packs guns that are still viable at tier difference and can pen from greater distances than Scharn can plus it still has the torpedoes and the sec load time which keeps it viable for close combat. But each to their own. If you prefer a more cruiserlike experience go for Scharn but if you enjoy more BB play go for Tirp,WorldOfWarships,dbhm6ou,3,t5_2t8uj

However after watching a recent tournament the one Flamu was casting for if there was a German tier  battleship in the match it was a Bismarck.  I saw the Tirpitz once though it may have been present in other matches I did not watch or that were not cast by Flamu but saw the Bizmarck a few more times.  My guess is that the Bis secondaries are much better than the Tirps.Both of them are very decent ships though and I have them both.

It creates huge problems for dds your window of opportunity is cut in half now.This skill has to go perhaps it should make the fighter plane a  plane squadron instead. Absolutely no reason to have this many fighter planes in the air. This will be an obligatory pick. Yet another HUGE NERF to CVs as well.

It is not affected by LOSyou will detect behind islands. It is not affected by cyclones which now become absolutely pointless you will never again ambush or be ambushed in a cyclone.

You can easily torp DDs in smoke because now you know with  certainty they are inside it even if they are not firing.Good dds who know to drop smoke and quickly move out are nerfed people wont be wasting their time being careful towards the smoke because they can SEE you are no longer inside it. Ive done this so many times and many playersBBs will turn towards the smoke no need to do that now they will turn towards you instead.This is so enraging I urge people to go test it because it is so retarded it seems like we are making this up. This has to be removed period. Nor ifs or buts. I will severely cut my time playing the game if this goes live. I am a dd main currently on the tier  german line.

10149905,0,t1_dbufui9,gtThe problem with the approach is that it completely invalidates destroyers which imo are already suffering quite heavily. The fact DDs were the most played ship in ranked last season tends to invalidate this line of thinking. Tier  DDs in particular need some love but on the whole DDs are fine with some exceptions.gtNot to mention there are several cruisers which are completely reliant on their stealth to survive all the RN and many of the IJN.... In general a DD should be in front of these ships thus rendering them safe from this skill but Ill concede thats not always the case. gtAlso due to the ridiculous power of battleships its entirely feasible to go destroyer hunting. Examples include but are not limited to the Bismarck Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. German BBs are the exception to the rule but your not going to go DD hunting in a Yamato for example. The ships you listed have hydro fastfiring guns and good secondaries respectively though in truth they all have the last two traits to some extent. gtThe only problem that exists is that battleships are too powerful. They were designed to be the counter to cruisers from the start and over the last year have lost their own counter the destroyer. If you look at the overall stats like I have you will see in general they are fine but Ill be making a post on that SoonTM. Until then you can either take my word on that or go digging thorugh the stats yourself gtOutside of low tier matches battleships dominate everything. There is no reason to play anything BUT a battleship. Id actually argue that at midtier there is no reason to play anything but a BB or CACL and at higher tiers it becomes more balanced. CVs excepted of course. gtIt speaks volumes to the utter incompetence of the leadership of the development team that this issue has not been recognized and addressed already. Id recommend you go ahead and look through the full server stats yourself not the incomplete stats from sites like warships.today.

10165582,0,t1_dbw90qq,since it is very clear that you dont understand this and it seems like you also dont understand counter strike let me explain. first my credentials my steam page and how I have over  hours in csgo and the highest rank I achieved LEM third highest rank in valve match making top  of  players every day for more on this here is what the rank distribution looked like when I got LEM and here is the steam chart on player count in counter strike this was  months ago early december .First you are right that you can hear footsteps but thats a skill you need to setup for by having good equipment knowing what to listen for and skill to put your settings correct. they are also not even within .o and you only have audio clues about where footsteps are. on some maps like the second most played map mirage when you stand on arches on the B site you can hear footsteps coming from  of  different places but you dont know where it is exactly because one path goes directly into the site and the other goes into mid but both sound the same. you hear that at least one person is there but thats it. you cant see that they are bearing o from north from your position. the enemy also needs to mess up and RUN for this to be viable. if they walk you get no info and cant make a callout. with RDFRPFwhateverthebullshitmechaniciscalled you are told BY THE GAME where the nearest ship is at ANY RANGE to within .o . footsteps are nothing like walls as you need to rotate your player to get better positioning and it can be fooled by holding shift to walk. you cant do that with stealth ships. if you still dont understand how bullshit this is allow me to explain with Titanfall the original. I ended it with around  hours in it and played in several tournaments in the comp scene. this comp scene was player run and had player made rules for the settings. one of them was to OUTRIGHT BAN ONE WEAPON. this weapon was called the smart pistol. its thing was that if you were within distance the smart pistol locked on to the target if it was a player it took . seconds to fully lock on and then you click mouse  and the targets die. did I mention? THIS WEAPON IS A BUILT IN FUCKING AIMBOT AND EVERYONE KNEW IT. because of this it was banned from all comp play and it is broken as shit BECAUSE IT IS A FUCKING AIMBOT. was it a cheat to use in normal game? no because it was built in. does that mean that people sat around with their thumb up their ass and did nothing? your can bet your life savings that they did not. for the sequel it was nerfed a bit to make it so you only have  bullets to shoot and you only have it for  life max at a time as it was a boost thing so it wasnt even a primary weapon. yet its still broken as shit because ITS BUILT IN FUCKING AIMBOT which is a cheat. RDF is built in walls.any argument you can think of is invalid because in the current state of the captain skillgt ITS BUILT IN FUCKING WALLHACKSif you dont get it now nothing will help you understand. ,WorldOfWarships,dbwbpam,2,t5_2t8uj

10254017,0,t1_dc6buwp,gtThis is all useless if you dont take into account their desiredpriority targets dealing  damage againt mainly other destroyers in a match is significantly more impactful than averaging  damage against mainly Battleships. Damage statistics are useless for destroyers without this.You have just made an excellent argument for why Montana is perfectly fine compared to Yamato as she prioritizes cruisers that have smaller HP pools. Getting back on track since Shimakaze fights battleships with what we can all agree are the most imprecise weapons in the game most of the torpedoes are going to miss limiting overall damage even when taking the targets larger HP pool into account. gtCoincidentally her average damage is also SIGNIFICANTLY higher than Gearing because VMF DDs prioritized targets have SIGNIFICANTLY more health.With around  players a week we cannot discount the probability that the average Khabarovsk player is better and more experienced than the average Shimakaze and Gearing player. You have to take sample size into account. gtShimakaze is literally by far and alone the single worst ship you can have on your teamThen why is her recent winrate near identical to Gearings These two are the most played tier  ships with similar sized player bases thus we can reasonably conclude the average player skill is about the same between these ships. gt it is detrimental to get one assigned to your side where the enemy gets a Khab or Gearing because she CANNOT outbrawl other DD by design and she CANNOT do her job because her tools have been dicked over hardcore.. Shimakazes job is fighting battleships not other destroyers. She is specialized just like Khabarovsk is specialized. .

10254851,0,t3_5mtwdg,I think you have some good ideas overall. I am really fond of making AA more powerful but at the same time more skillintensive to use though Id recommend this not for all classes but exclusively for cruiser to make them stand out and further define their role. AA cones are a great idea but the CV player must have a means to recognize that a cone has been set before it is too late to do anything about it. Regarding spotting Id even propose a more radical solution Give every CV a dedicated spotter plane which is the only plane to relay enemy positions and torps to your team. The other aircraft will only spot for yourself just like they now do in cyclones. That would transform spotting from a sometimes just random activity to a willful conscious activity. I am also intrigued by spotting requiring line of sight I do believe that terrain should be obstructing the view of the planes and of radar tbh. ,WorldOfWarships,dc6fz1l,5,t5_2t8uj

10312113,0,t1_dccuy7s,Gearing has the exact same concealment as the Shimakaze so its telling enough of your ignorance about destroyers. Yuugumo is .km more stealthy than Fletcher but loses out in speed and maneuverability. They can get into position just the same and are more able to defend themselves if things dont go right. Range is irrelevant on torpedoes? How about I shave down your battleship firing range to km then? Makes no difference does it? Japanese torpedoes had good striking potential but thanks to nerfs hydro and radar anyone can simply avoid even a wellplaced spread which is limited by how many torpedoes you could fire at once. Shimakaze is thus able to account for dodges more effectively.And no I think American torpedoes are better because they are more likely to hit and deal consistent damage when used in the same way as Japanese torpedoes. Its not about blundering into things. Youre the one ignoring how a line is objectively weaker than another line in nearly all aspects. Think about that. Youre whining as if people never had a chance to avoid torpedoes before without ever realizing that the same WASD hacks can simply mitigate the damage but yet people are calling for nerfs that literally patch the line out of existence. ,WorldOfWarships,dccxn2b,2,t5_2t8uj

And there is nothing wrong with being an awful player though I probably would have switched to coop long before k games since you are hurting your teammates now. But thats your decision to make cant imagine it is that fun to lose often and do little damage but to each their own.But a couple things here seem weird. Your total battles seems very high for being tier  so I assume you played a lot at low tiers which should have given you an edge after quite a few games and better stats due to low skill level usually below tier . Also you say you have invested  on that acct so you have a bunch of premium ships? If so your damage and exp seem impossible. Most premiums even played by awful players can do better than that. Stats usually suffer from heavy grinds through stock hulls and modules once a ship is elited or a premium they should do better than those stats.My advice if you are as stressed about your stats as this post suggest is to scrap that acct and start a new one with a referral code to get some nice goodies incl a couple premium ships.,WorldOfWarships,dcjasp8,0,t5_2t8uj

10371043,0,t1_dcjij9u,uSubOctavian I understand the purpose of this skill but I find that without it being a consumable style choice that it will be counterproductive to the enjoyment of the game.For starters it absolutely ruins strategic movement of ships around the map. A destroyer that was previously able to sneak around to an unprotected capture point can now no longer do so. There is little punishment for playing poorly and not defending the ground youve gained.Secondly it negatively effects destroyers cruisers and CVs. Destroyers will now have their torpedoes avoided far more easily by other ships and it will almost completely eliminate ambushes.For cruisers it destroys there ability to ambush destroyers and leaves them exposed to battleships As much as I think this design choice will hurt destroyers I believe cruisers will be hurt the most because they have smaller room to hide. Destroyers will simply be held back until cruisers are hit from BBs and sunk. This will lead to stagnant game play again.CVs will be hurt because theyll be spotted even more easily and sunk more easily. For the class with the highest repair cost and lowest income thats not a good design.,WorldOfWarships,dcjmbh1,8,t5_2t8uj

10383122,0,t1_dckpihw,The reason IJN didnt use their guns was because they were too high risk low reward. They had bad reload so their DPM isnt high and it exposes them to detection where their low HP and sluggish rudder makes it more difficult to survive than a USN DD. A USN DD can not only fire twice as fast more DPM means you kill the target faster and thus go back into concealment faster they have longerlasting smoke so they can avoid detection better than IJN DDs can.If they want to make IJN ships fire their guns more its really simple buff them so they dont suck.

Observant players can already figure out an enemy players sector in many situations by keeping an eye on the minimap.As others said I fully expect an aim assist in this game now. What sort of justification is this? Of course since good players already know how to aim it makes no difference right?Desperate excuses time to put the PR spin machine into motion. But it gets better.gtYou also get a warning when tagged with Radio Position Finding giving you plenty of time to adjust your tactics accordingly. Concealment still gives you an advantageYou know about the lie repeated long enough becoming the truth? Again with the screwed logic. In what way being undetected matters when you know exactly where said undetected ship is? Oh you cant shoot at it but that is irrelevant considering that is not the point if the ship in question is relying on you NOT knowing its there in order to kill you.Imagine an FPS where you can put mines where people can walk over and get killed. Now imagine a skill that lets you see the nearest mine ALL THE TIME. Now tell me this skill does not counter mines in every way possible just because you cant shootdisable those mines from beyond a certain range? Who cares the purpose of a mine is to kill you by surprise genius.You can try your hardest to deny RPFs offensive capabilities with the shittiest excuses but you also cant deny its defensive capabilities at the same time.But the gold is yet to come.gtOK maybe its not a gamebreaker but why introduce it in the first place?gtWe wanted a Skill designed for the role of destroyerhunting cruisers and destroyers. The Skill is appealing if youre working on a dedicated destroyerhunting build but probably isnt worth the investment if youre focusing on a different build or playstyle.But I thought that Observant players can already figure out an enemy players sector in many situations by keeping an eye on the minimap.So what is WG? Are good players not already capable of perfectly predicting where enemy DDs are and hunt them while also avoiding them? By your own logic people dont need this because we are good enough to know where the ships are already.We dont need a skill to hunt DDs By your own admission players can learn to do this when they become better at the game and there are tools available like I dont knowCVs radar hydro floatplane figthers and the one you seem to like the most being good and using the minimap.gtCant someone make a mod that uses the data from Radio Position Finding to precisely point out a ship?When designing this Skill we identified such a possibility.

10420001,0,t1_dcow89v,gt Simplest fix IMO would be to guarantee a puff and the end of the smokes duration regardless of the code. Ive been shortchanged smoke in plenty of other lines too so I think this would be a positive change overall.This  Or if that is to heavy a load on the server  client simply move the most recently laid puff to the location where the last puff would be laid. Or better still  as the smoke cloud completes  calculate what it SHOULD have looked like due to ship movement and speed and adjust the puff placement to get the correct shape to the smoke.That may of course result in you flying out of your cloud if you are still moving forward  The point is that for modelling line of sight and rendering smoke Wargaming has decided to implement smoke clouds as a series of discrete objects puffs but that does not mean that the engine cant work out where to put those puffs to get the best representation of a real smoke cloud using the minimum number of objects.,WorldOfWarships,dcp6c7d,3,t5_2t8uj

10479575,0,t1_dcvtfms,gt Then why do their winrates flipflop? Id expect a noticeable difference between the two if this logic held.You are just nitpicking at this point. Yes it does flop around a bit but its due to the two being inherently close to each other in the first place and normal random variance pushing one over the other. If you actually take the sum and average of the entire  points you will getGearing .Shimakaze .That doesnt seem so different does it? Data over a small subset of a week can be more biased than data taken over a longer period. Id have thought youd have realized this already considering how much you talk about data check the data then form your theory?. You may want to start including moving averages into your data charts per XXX games played as one point to better track performance right now it can be skewed by many variables even such as difference in games played. Not sure if you are able to grab data like that from the servers but it would be much better than having data just purely based on time.While I do mention Gearing is much more influential in caps and knifefighting and thus contribute more to the team a good Shima can do so its just more difficult and inconsistent. A good Gearing will probably have  games where he does within  of normal damage just a number for examples sake not a real statistic. Whereas Shima can have much more variance due to the unreliability of torpedoes thus may have more games where they do about  but get an occasional game where they do  better than normal due to a lucky torp volley or potato enemies. While the data all averages out the Gearing will feel better to play as you are performing better every game and rarely have really bad games where a Shimakazes gameplay is feast or famine and thus the player doesnt feel it as fun as they are probably only enjoying a small amount of games where they get to wreck noobs.,WorldOfWarships,dcvyv25,1,t5_2t8uj

10494801,0,t3_5qaoku,WG has made end  meta a spike damage fest. The difference in burst between tiers suffers from insane creep and they keep increasing it.Nearly all changes they introduce promote long range engagement and punish aggressive tactical gameplay.Risk vs Reward is skewed. Time to kill at tier  is a fraction of the insta gib fest you see at higher tiers especially at tier . Cruisers dont push because they are afraid of a RNG citadel from a BB  km outside of their max range.  So they hang back and burn anything that comes into their rage.  Since they arent spotting DDs its usually BBs that end up burning.  Got  ships targeting you?  The you made a mistake crutch notification tells you to change course and get bow on.   BBs bow on because closing the distance means getting focused fired and burned.   The ridicules bow on meta is there at every tier.   CVs are plagued with boring game mechanics and AA from hell. DDs are either Radio Located Sonar Located or Radar Located.The very nature of DDs means they are more powerful the longer the match lasts.  So they sit back and torp wall from max range.Capping points in smoke was always risky now anyone with RPF knows exactly where in the smoke you are.   Sneakiness doesnt pay anymore.Soon invisible fire will go away and youll see DDs hang back until BBs push.Things will get worse before they get better. Reduce fire chance reduce remove citadel damage decrease bow on effectiveness remove RPF maybe well see more aggressive gameplay.

10519273,0,t1_dczo3jg,The point though is that it has to be a  increase on ALL targets or you are nerfing your combat potential.BB damage inflates your average damage in games because they have the largest HP pools but if you are dealing  more damage to BBs only but  less damage to everything else you are probably actually hurting your overall impact on the game even if your average damage numbers are higher because of HP inflation.It is also worth noting that IFHE does absolutely nothing against T BBs and has minimal impact on T BBs. It has zero impact on T cruisers and zero impact on all destroyers while BFT will give you  benefit against all targets regardless of type class and a  benefit against CVs. It basically just makes you between  better while IFHE can potentially double your raw damage against specifically Nagato Colorado Fuso New Mexico Warspite Bayern and Arizona it is only in scenarios where HE will do more damage than AP and that is probably less often than most people think. You would be suprised how many people do not angle against an Atlanta and I do not have the data on what the true performance is because theoretically doubling DPM is never going to happen I would say best case scenario might be in and around a  boost in HE direct damage but keep in mind that the sacrifice to fire chance is substantial and Atlanta is beastly at starting fires without IFHE. It can also be argued that you deal more damage starting a fire and switching targets to something else instead of spamming shells on a burning BB regardless of penetration.,WorldOfWarships,dd0h1sb,1,t5_2t8uj

Thats not to say shell be bad shell be very good but Scharnhorst and Gneisenau shine in situations where there are tons of Cruisers that arent necessarily going to be protected by BB support due to how the  v  battles tend to shake out. But Nagato and to a lesser extent Colorado counter Scharn and Gnei pretty hard due to just how much damage and penetration those  rifles have especially when compared against Scharn and Gneis armor scheme and the fact that KM BBs dont take reduced damage from overpens. I think Nagato will still be the star of the T BB show followed by Gnei. Scharns  rifles occasionally have trouble getting through angled Cruisers which limits her effectiveness while Gnei can overmatch BB bows which helps offset her lack of guns compared to the others. But a good Nagato or even Lolorado should be able to keep most Scharn and Gneis at bay especially in the v format of ranked. ,WorldOfWarships,dd0rct7,1,t5_2t8uj

The Gaede is hilarious when a CL offers broadside because he assumes you are just another DD to be dealt with.But... they are no fun. It is all an effort. You have to think every fricking time how to move for a torpedo run or whether the timing is right to open fire with the guns. Because even if you kill that enemy DD km out his friends km out can still see you after the fact...The bloom is utterly devastating to the German DD line. And they took all the evasive boons away. Too slow to run away smoke too short a duration to hide for any length of time...The guns are amazing at ltkm but soon reach the anemic USN shelllobbing beyond that.The AP eating hulls are just icing on the cake. I mean I can understand what they tried to do with this line but it just is too bad.

Is it  ship killed per game? Is it  cap points? Is it based off shiptype?If you are struggling with this question Id suggest starting from the bad thing you are trying to prevent and working backwards.gt I do believe however that it doesnt change the fact that there is essentially no real barrier to progression in RandomCoop for badly performing players getting their hands on more advanced ships.This strikes me as intentional.  Not all of the game is competitive.  There are many players that are just playing to progress through the ship lines.  The game is built for potatoes to have fun too.gt Flamu has spoken about this before especially when it came to high tier premium ships becoming available to the general public. People who have never played advanced nonpremium ships that suddenly spend  on a ship and are outclassed amp underperform because they have little experience.gt Now thats just the premium amp maybe that is a different conversation. I do view this as a different problem.  Derpitzes often learn to play.

This basically applied to most high tier battleships if they come under fire from other battleships at a closetomedium range.I bet these players see others doing it or see streamers do it but dont understand that it is a situational thing not an entire playstyle.So TLDR this isnt new and the game doesnt reward this all the time.

11097314,0,t1_depu9b5,gtI know this is another pileup question on this but how do you know if your item is authentic?Short of getting an expert or buying from a reputable dealer you dont. You can however use some common sense. With my homecoming pennant for example it came from a destroyer escort no one here has heard of and was not unusually advertised in this particular estate sale which had a hundred items. In addition it came with a signed historical summary with the name of a specific sailor and a check historical records would show if this sailor served on this ship which I unfortunately did not have time to do in advance. Both the pennant and the summary clearly show age the data on the summary is in the mid s. If someone was going to fake it they would not go through so much trouble for such a completely unknown ship and not advertise it heavily on such an obscure website. Thus while I dont have complete confirmation my pennant is legitimate I have little reason to doubt its authenticity. I would have spent far more time and effort authenticating something from a more famous ship. You wont have that luck with anything German Italian or Japanese. There will be more fakes than real pieces. For the flagship of the Battle of Jutland Id proceed very cautiously. Ensure an expert signed off on it one whose credentials you should investigate on your own. ,WorldOfWarships,depvd1d,2,t5_2t8uj

11109038,0,t3_5yl83z,I am bothered by it because its ridiculous. I have no issue with your first shot being from stealth that is fine. Its part of the game to get into position and ambush if you can.   However the silliness that you can fire from inside smoke at a target who in return cannot see you has got to go. Sorry if they cannot see into the smoke the idea that ships on your side can spot for you accurately enough to see them and shoot them is ludicrous game or no game. At most you should have mini map updates. At most smoke should increase dispersion of shots fired against you. If you dont fire you go undetected. If you fire you are detected by at least what you can see and if you stop your normal cool down applies to go back undetected    As for long distance stealth firing no. If you dont want to be hit then lob over an island or a fellow team member.     Even destroyers firing guns can pump out smoke and muzzle flash. but spotting is comical already in this game and accuracy at range is so over the top its purely arcade    concealment and such should only determine how close you can get and how far you must get to remain unseen,WorldOfWarships,der77c6,1,t5_2t8uj

I think a change to a system where your detection decreases at a set rate down to your base detection after firing would work  so it would work like this right now your detection blooms for  seconds and stays at its maximum for that long.Instead have it decrease down to your standard detection at a rate that would take that same sec rather than all at once at the end.  Perhaps just add a  or sec delay before it starts decreasing and there youre set.

11202036,0,t1_df1pq4d,Yeah I posted it in a thread a while ago you should be able to forum search it looking for IFHE I did the test maybe a month or two ago.Basically IFHE is  worth it on tier  cruisers with less than mm guns.It is questionable on Belfast at lower captain levels because tier  matchmaking is very advantageous and absolutely does not replace using AP since I have gotten k damage AP salvoes against BBs with the belfast and my average AP salvo when I get the chance is between k which certainly averages better then what I normally farm with HE which peaks at K and averages .k  fire damage. Absolutely once you have CE SI and DE then IFHE is a no brainer on Belfast since it makes you much stronger when up tiered and the overall cost against lower tier ships is fairly minimal. Overall I think IFHE is worth it on the Belfast but it isnt strictly necessary.For ships with less than mm guns IFHE is extremely situational. I do not recommend it at all for US DDs and I think it is worth it on the atlanta but you absolutely need CEAFT before IFHE is even worth considering. The main benefit to atlanta is same and lower tier BB direct damage while against T BBs IFHE has zero impact except for a lower fire chance. Also IFHE makes zero difference against tier  or below cruisers and does not increase damage against DDs. Every section of armor on those ships would either allow you to pen or shatter your shells regardless. It is only T and T cruiser bow armor that will benefit the atlantas HE and I just dont think that that is an optimal scenario.Akizuki becomes a specialist DD hunter with IFHE since you lose your fire chance which is pretty handy against battleships but you could always rely on AP and torpedoes to damage BBs. Overall I do recommend IFHE on Akizuki but again this is a high captain skill build because you NEED CE and AFT is also useful due to the ships low speed and long stealth fire range. When they nerf stealth fire it may be better to completely ditch AFT and instead use SI or BFT.A general rule of thumb is that with mm guns IFHE is never going to HURT you but you have to keep in mind what the role of your ship is and if IFHE a very expensive skill is really worth it. IFHE is absolutely NOT worth it on any secondary build or BB it does nothing for mm guns and for mm or smaller guns it is also very questionable  situational. Russian DDs should not use IFHE because they have strong AP and HE should be used for the fire DoT US DDs should absolutely not use IFHE and the Atlanta is situational but with a  point captain I do think IFHE is justified.That is my personal feelings based on my results but if you are interested in seeing the ratio of shattered to penetrating shells with mm HE and AP shells with screen shots you should search my thread.When I have enough captain XP to level a decent atlanta captain I can do a better test where I really compare with and without results so I can get the realistic benefit rather than theoretical. The reason why I used mm instead of mm to test is because if mm shells can penetrate something then it is already guaranteed that  can pen it so what i was looking for is the maximum amount of gain that can be attributed to IFHE as a single variable.,WorldOfWarships,df1qiui,2,t5_2t8uj

And I am guilty of it too.The only times where I find myself stealth fired to death were where I made a mistake... And if I had better positioning they would not be a problem.And one thing... You cant only think about what benefits your one class... You need to think in the broad pictures. Without stealth fire dds are going to be even more passive even less likely to  cap and resort to sending out Torps every  minutes... Do you really want that? I play high tiers a lot and honestly with proper and smart play stealth fire isnt as big of an issue as you think.Even zaos who are infamous for stealth fire are detected at  km... A DD can safely keep him spotted if he shoots from max range and negate the stealth fire advantage. Of course being able to kill the zao is something else and that is up to the player.Im a bb main who play all classes... So I am most comfortable and consistent in bb but I am decent in all classes... And I will tell you ijn DD will need substantial buffs... And actual buffs not Shima getting a . sec reload and weaker he and calling that a buff...They completely requires stealth and stealth fire... Otherwise you will never have them scout or cap... Or fire their guns except in smoke...Just look at the German dds... They are more detectable Torp boats with good guns that are only used when you have a death wish or when you can isolate a target.Ijn DD with this stealth fire removed would just be stealthier and slower Torp reloading version of the German dds.,WorldOfWarships,df3048x,2,t5_2t8uj

11266985,0,t1_df7yjac,they arent. That isnt why its a massive nerf to US cruisers and DDs.The nerf they are proposing to eliminate stealth fire severely hurts ships that do not rely on stealth fire at all.Currently in a Baltimore or Des Moines firing your guns blooms your detection to about . km or so. The changes to stealth fire would mean this would be km. Neither ship relies on stealth fire but both ships rely on concealment heavily. Imagine if shimakaze had a  km stealth nerf how pissed IJN DDs would be. This is basically the same for US DDs and US cruisers if they push their oversimplified mongoloid solution to stealth fire through the works.US Cruisers are going to be incredibly painful to play with a substantial concealment nerf considering they are already one of the hardest classes in the game to play properly. With strong AP radar and decent useage of terrain you can severly limit the weaknesses of those ships but the detectability debuff is going ot make that substantially more difficult because even a base camping sniper in the corner of the map can potentially detect you at km away. The amount of additional surface area where something has to be just to spot you is massively increased with this change and ships like the Zao which dont stricktly NEED stealth fire will be largely un impacted where ships like Des Moines which eats citadels from every angle from any battleship will be even less convienent to play.This change is cancer and mark my words if they push this shit though high tier gameplay is going to get so much worse because cruisers are going to have to play even more cautiously snipe more and so are US DDs.So say goodbye to any semblance of aggression in tiers .Stealth fire DOESNT matter and this heavy handed approach to fixing a problem that almost doesnt exist is some donald trump level thinking.

Most bb dont push until all support is dead... then they push really really hard... because they cant spot anything.. then they die due to stealth fire... BUT if they push with their team as they are supposed to.. stealth fire is not an issue. EVEN with late game.. I just had a game where i was in a shima and a benson was firing his guns...  I spotted him as his gun bloom is higher than my detection.. and spotted for him for the iowa to shoot and kill. Did i not counter the stealth fire? I believe i did.. Its not hard... just require smart play..  Or my yuugumo spotting a zao who was  km away from me... a FDG nuked him. Did I not counter zaos stealth fire? I believe I did...Just because the players play selfishly and decide to push when they shouldnt and die because of it. or they yolo and run off away from team and cant detect anything. That isnt a stealth fire problem..  that is the players needs to learn the game problem.

This was already true as the closer you get to a US destroyer for example the more likely it is that your turrets cant keep up while theirs can. Sitting in smoke is a bad idea for any unmaneuverable ship and that was a foolish idea even before this patch. So if its a bad idea as we all agree dont sit in smoke. Use it to cover a retreat when you fight off more than you can chew give your allies some cover short smoke is better than no smoke at all and generally play to your strengths and dont magnify your weaknesses. ,WorldOfWarships,dfk7iwd,1,t5_2t8uj
11365657,0,t3_627a2q,Interesting. I had this very same discussion with a friend. Dreadnought at T very much so. We then wondered whether it would be the Bellerophon class at T  guns  of them in five turrets or the HMS Neptune Not to be confused with the cruiser of the same nameWe actually thought that Nelson would be much higher TT with HMS Rodney also Nelson class famous as being one of the ships present to sink Bismarck as a premium ship. Those  x guns foreward firing would bloody well hurt and would be more than appropriate to keep her on par with the IowaMontanaF.Der territory.T while Id also love to have something that would nuke a Yamato like the N and L we actually thought that Vanguard would serve better for it instead of T despite a drop in gun calibre.  knots top speed would allow it to actually chase down other BBs and even some CLs. If you wanted something even bigger though and were looking at messing with prototypes we did have the HMS Incomparable on the drawing board which might have been a giggle. It never saw construction but did have designs and would have been x  guns. Yes mm.  knots too but sod all armour. However that size of gun would leave a mark. Id have said it should be higher though as IIRC someone correct if wrong it was redesigned following lessons learned after encounters with TirpitzBismarck etc so would make sense to either match or be higher than it in the tech tree.,WorldOfWarships,dfk9xf1,3,t5_2t8uj

You could get km range with Aki and I was hoping theyd mess with the shell traits to make that viable but km range is a  second flight time you are literally a DD trying to shoot like a BB lol except your dinky shots hit for chump change instead of deleting a cruiser.Akizuki is the ship you take when you want to shoot at planes but dont want defensive fire I guess.

11366713,0,t1_dfkdn8e,gtI get they want to experiment but I just dont think the air groups are the problem so a more standardized air group would be fine.Think of it this way. There are five likely CV lines two US two Japanese and a British line. How do you differentiate between the lines particularly those of the same nation? If they all have the same loadouts the ones with the largest hanger or best aircraft will win. The other three lines will be all but useless. You already see this with tier  Hiryu has the most planes Saipan the best and Ranger sucks. Technically Ranger has one more plane than Hiryu but you get the point. By testing different squadron loadouts even extreme ones like these Wargaming is trying to figure out what directions could work for future lines. Sure this  is ridiculous but could  or  with larger torpedo squadrons work? By testing the  loadout with  plane squadrons Wargaming is testing just how small you can make the squadrons possibly for ships like Tone and how a fightertorpedo bomber loadout will work one that will prove important when RN CVs arrive they used very few dive bombers most of those fighterdive bomber hybrids. If its too weak they buff the ship and test another loadout. ,WorldOfWarships,dfke8bf,1,t5_2t8uj

11449853,0,t1_dftsw82,gt I think premium ship rewards are the best way to convince players to keep playing ranked and I think ranked players will only be interested in your reward ship if its good.This isnt true for any other game please explain why it would be true for WoWs.Ranked play should offer a more competitive format it does with skill based matchmaking it doesnt and that format should attract the competitive players who are otherwise stuck in random matches shitshow.  gt I dont think players who have ranked out  times are that interested in getting  doubloons doubloons are a more interesting reward for new players than experienced ones.Doubloons are the same as offering premium ships as new ones come out can can be purchased for doubloons. gt I certainly agree that the ship rewards shouldnt imbalance competitive play but I also dont think they do. But it is totally okay for them to imbalance every other arena? WoWs has fairly shit balance to begin with simply due to no real matchmaking but if youre up against a division of three Blacks you just cannot take whatever ground they want.

With the Rubble having tanked over the past few years I dont think well see that change any time soon.I do hope well see more eyecandyrelated improvements though. Mostly involving water and explosions. BB guns are already receiving prettier effects but Im not sure there are actual enginelevel lighting changes involved in that. Water splashing from the bow on my DDs waves and the water surface in general and fancier torpedo explosion effects are other things Id love to see. Same with detonations.

11478084,0,t1_dfx0t6g,gtI really cant agree with this. In my view adding counterconcealment mechanics results in players emphasizing cover.  That may be true for players but I meant in terms of game focus as I described before.  gtI get the feeling that WG is trying to make mobile openwater gameplay a thing but they cant figure out how to do it.  I dont think its a thing they can fix mechanically.  The main problems are incompetence and the inherent Prisoners Dilemma.  gtThe trouble with this is that BBs are already the scary class. Youll need to rebalance a lot of stuff if detection is easier and smoke is worse.  Im okay with them rebalancing a lot of stuff even regardless of detection and smoke.  The game is not well balanced at all right now.  gtI find this has worked out rather well. Different islands for different purposes. Increased feeling of map diversity.  I dont think its added to the diversity of maps or gameplay.  Its not like theyve done anything clever with it.  Theyve basically just looked at some heatmaps and opened up some firing lines in places that were short on engagement.

Im a unicum IJNonly player here are my main builds  Destroyer  Shimakaze build for lower tier DDs I switch out Adrenaline Rush for EM to fix the horrible turret traverse you can reduce it from  seconds to under  with EM and turret traverse mod. This one is very standard wouldnt really recommend diverging from it. You can also swap torpedo reload perk for DE on the lower tier DDs if you want though.Light Cruiser  Mogami gets her own captain because IFHE is mandatory on s. Torpedo Vigilance is my personal little preference you can easily swap it out for AR and a tier  perk. In the next patch you could also just swap EM for AR since turret traverse is getting buffed by  seconds or something stupidly huge.  Heavy Cruiser  Used for the mm cruisers Superintendent for the extra repair. Along with Torpedo Vigilance another personal preference choice in the loader perk. The mm HE and AP are both very good so I like to be able to switch quickly since it can make the difference of several K depending on your target.  Battleship  Secondary spec. This is  not the optimal build but I have the most fun with this and its still viable. I wouldnt use this for Ranked or anything though. The entire line from Nagato on does have very powerful secondaries theyve just been overshadowed a bit by Bismarck and co.  Carrier  All the important plane  torpedo buffing skills then Concealment Expert for not getting shotted while closer to action and AFT for AA range.

The Premium Graf Spee has selfheal good torp arcs but is slow long reload etc  IJN DDs can stealthtorp from ? km without those very long reloads and also.. without an here extra torp volley after s consumable.  The Ru DD still only has  km torps so imo Anshan gtgt that one  I dislike Farragut low Health pool and needs to sacrifice a turret for def. AA cant stealthtorp. So.. eh.  BBs Fuso is imo very good NM can deal good damage too the Bayern gets  guns making Warspite a bit.. eh  we then have Arizona Mutsu Dunkek..  Honestly those are pretty balanced overall.  In cruisers Cleveland to make CV cry Budyonny is accurate Aoba too of the mm variety with longer ranged torps the Molotov has those mms but gets citadeled too itself the Leander has only  guns vs  on the Belfast and no radar nor concealment slot.  The Perth would be a quirky ship to face I guess but still not Belfast level   CVs well.. Ruiyo vs Independence Indy could use extra spare planes for the  loadout and a  loadout instead of ..

Containers was their newest addition which is a literal copy of the loot crate model of other games which got nerfed anyway when it actualy was reasonable. Half of the campaign rewards are useless if you have any clue about the game or you dont have ships that can use them. Flag rewards beside credit and xp are also very ship dependant some of them are completely useless on some ships but they are time limited anyway.So... What exactly is WG giving me that I should be so grateful for? Do you mean the few thousand doubloons for rank  that requires anywhere from  games but is limited to a game mode only playable a few months per year anyway? You are barely earning  USD worth of rewards for h of work... Is that realy generous? If so I should be grateful I can earn a few extra cents per hour of work thanks WG.Meanwhile getting to tier  without premium is going to take any casual player months. I cant think of many MMOs that take months to reach max level these days.And while some types of games are historicaly famous for being very grindyasian MMOs some of those had a lot more depth to offermany different PvP modes PvE social aspects etc WoWs and family at the end of the day are the same v dozen of maps or so doing the same thing  times with sometimes barely any change as you progress.Id be very interested in how you could seriously make the case that WG is generous at all.You have no idea of the reputation WG games have out there do you?Oh boy someone needs to play more than one game in their life preferably not from the same company.Thanking WG for the pitiful rewards for their grindy games in the modern age of MMOs is like thanking your master for not letting you starve as you work h per day as a slave.

11711518,0,t1_dgnhn1n,Dispersion is in my opinion the absolutely most worthless stat in the game. Poor horizontal dispersion means more likely to get citadel hits at long range and less likely to damage saturate an area of the ship.Sigma is probably one of the most important stats in the game and is hands down THE most important attribute a BB can have. Crappy armor AA poor speed  maneuverability can all be made up for with main battery accuracy.While the hood is indeed faster than Colorado or Nagato with a . sigma it means that you are FORCED to get closer to targets than either Colorado or Nagato and with inferior penetration that basically means that the hood can tank when angled and that is about it.The . sigma and poor brawling capabilities put the ships strengths and weaknesses at odds and do not synergize. German BBs are MEANT to brawl but the hood is not. This makes the . sigma a HUGE downside not a minor inconvenience. So while Sharnhorst Colorado and Nagato will reliably chunk out damage at  km the Hood is going to have to push closer to deal damage and that then negates the speed advantage because you become trapped by being forced to angle against big guns and cut speed just so you can take hits without really being able to shoot back effectively without opening up your citadel to pain.It is like the Alabama when it was previewed. It was like a Brawler and not a Brawler and that made it overall pretty bad. It was the worst of both worlds. Hood is most certainly not a brawling battleship but . sigma IMPLIES that role and considering that hood and warspite have the same guns also doesnt make sense since Spite has . sigma. It isnt a boring change because sigma is INCREDIBLY important.Yamato for example only has . more sigma than any other BB but that . sigma makes all the difference.Dispersion is the far less important stat since good aim will land nearly all of your shells on target dispersion wise sigma is what determines how many of your shells actually aim where you want them to go. There is nothing you can do as a player skill wise that prevents shots from straddling a target with poor sigma but with good sigma good aim  consistent results and in the competitive meta consistency is the most important thing.There is a reason why NC is the favored BB in league battles right now. No other BB has as many Devastating strikes as the NC does in high tier gameplay. It isnt because the NC is OP in comparison to Amagi or Bismarck but simply that reliable MB guns is just that important strong AA doesnt hurt in MM that guarantees CVs every match either.Where I see hood being different from Colorado or Nagato is speed and where i see it being different from Gneisenau and Scharnhorst is Guns. The problem is right now it is too close to Gneisenau and it has FAR worse penetration than any of the other T BBs except for Scharnhorst. The  guns on Warspite and and Hood are actually much more like the US  guns on New Mexico in terms of penetration but have the ability to overmatch mm bow armor. The lack of penetration is significant against other BBs but the . sigma is extremely limiting to this ships mobility without strong secondaries or torpedoes there isnt any reason to push close and sitting at range will produce unreliable results.People tend to post videos of gameplay where they did particularly well and not representative of an average experience so consider the games you have watched as being best case RNG scenarios.,WorldOfWarships,dgnj3ep,1,t5_2t8uj

Gneisanau instead has the planned refit for the Bismarck class in guns mounted  guns x  turrets. Aside from that we dont know how the refit would have changed her. As I recall they planned to increase the armor which would harm the speed. In some ways bringing her closer to Kongo in battle cruiser converted to battleship. Could have effected her iconic profile slightly. As she sits shes fine with tweaking. Shes a very beautiful ship overall a battlecruiser shouldnt face a battleship in straight combat Denmark strait Jutland and honestly shes going to be a big seller most likely for the history of it. She was the pride of the Royal Navy before she blew up after all. Tldr Hood is iconic and represented close to life not the refit that got put off too long.

11791884,0,t3_688aaz,Iowa is probably my favorite ship in the game. You need to understand that you sacrifice armor for speed but you also have one of the best concealment of any BB. Use reduce dispersion mod and she is the most accurate BB at her tire. How to get good results in her? Understand that you are not a brawling BB if you do that youll die the Germans are far superior at that. You can snipe like a scrub but youll be missing out on so much that she can do. Despite all that I can reliably hold my flank alone against any and all paper ships and weeboo boats I do that regularly too. Iowa is the reason I love this game so much because you cant use her raw power to push the enemy but you have to make strategic planning to excel in her here is how to do that. Use her concealment as your biggest advantage keep everything further than . km and you will disappear between salvos. This discourages cruisers from spamming you with HE. What I do is to keep the ship moving at full speed use concealment trick to discourage cruisers and at that range you have just enough maneuverability to dodge BB shells like an oversized Khabarovsk.You need to be really good at predicting when your team is going to or needs to push OR the enemy team is going to push. This will be your best early warning system to reposition in time. If you see  enemy BB kill last of your BB support leaving you with cruisers only you need to stop firing to get concealment then turn around and engage while running away. Laugh as they try to catch you if they still overwhelm you just stop shooting and vanish.,WorldOfWarships,dgwnej9,3,t5_2t8uj

11796540,0,t1_dgx5v1u,haha yeah! Its kinda crazy that these mods are allowed... and offer an outright advantage for those that use them. ,WorldOfWarships,dgx6f2s,1,t5_2t8uj
11797007,0,t3_68ahi3,As a dd player its not to bad as I move around a lot and they only have so much rof. What it is great for is the smoke orgies of fragile CL playing hide the salami Im glad to see this. Now if all DDs got df with weak AA strength I would be happy not getting nuked by CVs  mins in.,WorldOfWarships,dgx8brt,1,t5_2t8uj
11797451,0,t1_dgx9hcz,Exact same position. The biggest problem is that even high tiers contain noobs now and they are using the same tactics they used in lower tiers. Its frustrating to be stuck with them!,WorldOfWarships,dgxa526,0,t5_2t8uj
11800230,0,t1_dgxd0u7,As a DD player the Frenchies are pretty nasty. Part of that is not really knowing how to counter them quite yet but they hit hard with their HE and can run you down. So I dont like em haha.,WorldOfWarships,dgxlhxx,3,t5_2t8uj
11803292,0,t1_dgxfeid,Yes you are confused.  ,WorldOfWarships,dgxy00b,2,t5_2t8uj
11805014,0,t3_68demi,Got my first SC in months last night...only to get a worthless module.Didnt WG say that they increased the chance of getting a SC in TYL or did I simply read something fake?,WorldOfWarships,dgy50ri,1,t5_2t8uj
11805214,0,t3_68ee13,hate the auto drop ... how anyone expects the manual nerf at t to entice anyone to cvs is beyond me. its so boring lacking in skill and is totally dependent on your target being a total brain dead moron ... which was the problem to start with because these were the people who complained cvs were deleting them.add to that AS bogues which were annoying before ... now are almost literally beatable if you are in anything else than an as bogue and I cant imagine how mind numbing that matchup must be. at least before in my zuiho or  bogue it was a tense game of kitestrafelure and decoy. now its click and go something else while rng happens ... not one scrap of skill. I have about k xp left to go on my  bogue ... Im thinking about free xping out of this fun little ship because auto dropping sucks so much. if the damage cvs do was so great ... change the economy. give us more xp for spotting and shooting down planes and less for pure damage. that would change the whole balance of cv play and let the potatoes that wg seem to feel are so important the game must be changed to prevent their feelings being hurt. They can continue being poor without getting deleted so quickly,WorldOfWarships,dgy5u4a,4,t5_2t8uj
11807735,0,t1_dgydbbc,Ive been playing since closed beta and Im about  in to it.,WorldOfWarships,dgyg4ko,1,t5_2t8uj
11810233,0,t1_dgylkvq,Yeah I mostly figure it might be decent in ranked  long smoke plus torp recon afterward for the team.,WorldOfWarships,dgyqbo5,2,t5_2t8uj
