That will be a lot of poke and youll need some serious camber and fender work to pull it off. The new wheels will poke . more than stock. Go measure if you need to.Your other option is to do a lug swap using Eti stuff or EM components.Personally I think both options are too much hassle to go through for a set of dime a dozen style s but its up to you. Youre probably going to spend as much money making them mountable as you did buying them. Ive seen some people filldrill the xs but the s just arent desirable.EDIT Just did a bit more searching apparently labs is doing mm x to x adapters.

440350,0,t1_cfqafq8,True. Didnt forget but after the E it appeared that BMW NA moved away from the use of M on the E and others to convey a sporty aesthetic and towards a naming nomenclature that expressed that very idea as the is model. What I thought odd when ordering my  E i M sport package was that it was called M sport and not an is. A year later the same i car was released as a production model badges is and not as M sport  the only difference now being the addition of black mirrors. Then one year later in  BMW NA drops the is badge and returns wholesale to what BMW calls M Performance cars. In Europe this was applied to Series sedan and wagon as well as the X and X SUVs. My comment about the liberal use of M was only that I believe that M should stand more for Motorsports and performance and not a badge to denote a nonfunctional and decorative aesthetic  like a door sill. I say this as the owner of both an E M and a i M sport but think maybe Im more of a purist than BMW NA.,BMW,cfqenw1,3,t5_2qn3a

On a sports car you are going to have a hard time finding used tires that are in any better shaped than whatever youve got on the car. The tire size just isnt common enough. If it was a Camry or accord or Ford  youd have better luck.

539123,0,t1_cg1fb2k,Thanks for the reply!Have you had any issues regarding constant repairs? It seems like going to a dealership to get repairs done is a very expensive endeavor once the warranty is done with.Also I believe they stiffened the suspension up with the sport package correct? This one doesnt have that so would likely be a smoother ride although obviously less agile. I guess Ill find out during my test drive today.One thing I actually am interested in is how the stock sound system is.

Then you have driving school during the morning with BMW instructors that teach you about proper braking traction control etc. Then a hotlap with one of the instructors best part! Then lunch again payed for by BMW and next is going through the off road course in an X or X and possibly visiting the museum they have. The final item is delivery of your BMW and you drive off.They also offer a factory tour afterwards this was not available when I picked up last summer.Basically youre only responsible for getting to the Greenville airport and gratuity for the hotel staff driver and servers.I did Euro delivery and Performance Center Delivery.

1248454,0,t3_28dyu7,You dont drive with the knee that you want you drive with the knee that you have. As I got older it got harder to drive stick.Even if you know how to drive stick and prefer stick cars doesnt necessarily force you to pick the manual transmission car. And sometimes the manual transmission is crap. Like a Fiat rental I got stuck with somewhere in Germany in the mid s. Oh wait the whole car was crap. Would I voluntarily drive a Miata any generation with an automatic transmission? Not one chance in hell. Light wellbalanced sports cars with just enough power are pure sheer joy to drive with a manual transmission. Would I use my lotto money to buy a  Porsche Turbo S which only ships with the DCT with the fist of an angry God I would. But I personally dont see a DCT as a true automatic transmission to me an automatic transmission has a torque converter. A DCT to me is a manual transmission with a builtin allknowing robot that can always shift faster than me and sometimes it can even pick the right gear all by itself.  Would I use the proceeds from any criminal enterprise I may or may not be involved with to purchase a pimpmobile like a Cadillac Escalade? Sure you only live once. ,BMW,cia2esz,6,t5_2qn3a

Otherwise its really dangerous for you and others especially those Harleys doing  while skirting the line on their side. I cant drive it more than once in either direction more than  turns without wanting to head for straighter faster roads with longer curves and sweepers.The Hellbender NC  and the cherohola skyway are also excellent roads with the skyway being my personal favorite of the three.

The d is an absolute beast in everyday kinds of driving where the massive torque makes everything completely effortless the only things Ive driven that pulled more were the F d same engine with  less pounds to pull around and a hp E S AMG which was on a completely other level. The ActiveHybrid is completely pointless though because its essentially a heavier i with a tiny trunk that costs  euros more with hardly any benefit in fuel economy. I havent tried the US d or the EU d which is pretty much the same but Id imagine theyre just a bit slower than a i but would still have that nice diesel torque  better fuel economy so Id probably still choose the d over the i.,BMW,ckhzch9,2,t5_2qn3a

2312394,0,t1_clwex4j,Wtf are you talking about?? The bit that says M power is a piece of plastic held onto the actually cover by two mm nuts.  It is a shield  thats it.  It shields the coil packs.  I have had four ms and my current s.  Thats an s.  It has a metal oil filter housing.  No one buys an M oil filter housing and the plastic BMW valve cover shield to fool anyone.  Thatd be a first.  That and it is obvious when you put your right foot down.  The head cast is the same as is the valve cover.  You can put the regular BMW cover on an S and have it say BMW instead of M power.  That is a motor out of a car that was totalled.  You can tell because of the chalk writing.  That is probably why it has the standard plastic shield.

2509544,0,t3_2oc5f3, VANOS Oil Pump IIRC the high pressure oil line to the VANOS system can rupture. If the car is running when this happen it will destroy the engine in a matter of seconds. Check the VANOS system for proper operation no noises rattles tapping and check the high pressure oil hoses for cracks and leaks. If the hose shows any signs have it replaced immediately.  Avoid SMG It looks good on paper its horrible from an engineering stand point. There are lots of sensitive electronics and control modules that run the SMG system that will go bad and none of them are cheap fixes.  Check for oil leaks The Es love to leak oil parts are cheap labor isnt. Check the oil pan gasket valve covers and alternator gasket seals. These are major leakers and can cause problems if theyre leaking badly.  Check the engine mounts. BMW cannot build engine mounts. Typically cabin and steering wheel vibration and changes in pitch of the vibration are good signs the mounts are shot. And obligatory get a PPI from a certified shop or BMW dealership. When you do purchase one have all the fluids done oil brakes power steering differential cooling etc.Any high performance car will have parts that will wear faster. I have an E i which is one step below an M in the  series category and while I love the car it does develop stupid problems over time.

Its nice to let it work for you when you are just on a normal commute and its just a button next to the shifter if you want to turn it off completely.  Ill admit that I was never able to develop a strong heeltoe downshift though and being able to rev match while having my foot only braking makes me MUCH faster and comfortable in track environments.  I wish there was a system that only matched for you while braking.Its kinda fun to play with though if you put the clutch in you can put the stick into different gates and the car will hang the revs where that gear is.  It made it much easier to explain the idea behind choosing gears when teaching my SO to drive the car.

I mean you can get a range rover sized SUV on truck suspension for K theyre so common I honestly dont think regular cars would sell in the U.S.  I mean an average U.S. built SUV makes an X look like a hot hatch....I dont think the U.S. would continue buying small compact cars if they didnt come with captains seats in them now.  Any time someone gets into my bucket seats all I hear about is how unsafe they feel so low to the ground...  then I am like Mom you used to strap me into the front seat of an  chevrolet chevette when I was an infant the floorboards were covered in pieces of sheet metal rivited to the body to pass safety inspection and you feel unsafe in my car?,BMW,cql4ku9,6,t5_2qn3a

That DIY is on converting the SMG to a manual. Id be better off buying a manual transmission with all the parts used from some car junk yard. ,BMW,cse0f5z,1,t5_2qn3a

Assuming thats around   sales tax  registration fees  documentation fee  electronic filing. So the downpayment really is about   is that fair to say? or would you not calculate that. The dealership told me that they just move the money around  if I want no DP they will just artificially inflate my monthly payment. Seems like my best bet would be to get  more of incentives to cover this DP cost and still be month which is my ideal monthly payment point. Thanks for the advice!,BMW,csfrgl2,2,t5_2qn3a

5008792,0,t3_3jjbdh,The ignition charges the key fob when its inserted. All previous generation BMWs without comfort access was like this. The DME also stores various information to the fob such as millage maintenance info as well as driver profile information. In the scenario that you explained you dont need to reinsert and eject the key again to fully power off the car. If you start the car without the fob and hit the button to shut off the engine and the vehicles accessories still powered on all you need to do is hit the StartStop button again and the rest of the vehicle will power off. My E i is this way as well. When you say you can start the vehicle without the fob is that right after you inserted it to power on the car? Or can you at any time start the car without the fob? If the car is running with the fob in the ignition the car is powered off and the key removed then within  seconds IIRC the StartStop button is pushed again the car should start back up.

5748673,0,t1_cx92kc8,As someone whos owned  turbo Subarus and worked for Subaru for years Im sorry but youre wrong. reliable is a relative term and relative to the benchmark set by Toyota and Honda.... Subarus especially turbo ones are simply not that reliable.First of all anytime you turbo charge any engine you just made it less reliable are you introduced multiple new points of failure more wear and tear and more stress on the internals. But even so boxer engines have their own inherent design flaws. I LOVE the symmetrical weight aspects and extremely low center of gravity that this setup allows you to have... BUT by design flat s are less reliable than Is. A lot has to do with how you have to setup the cooling system and uneven piston head temps you also have to have twice as many cams and divide them up in an ackward way that creates engineering hurdles that Is dont have to deal with.Now again this is relative to what most people consider reliable i.e. a basic honda or toyota. For what the WRX is a turbo AWD street rally car essentially it is very reliable. But you can then only compare it to the likes of like an Audi S or VW Golf R or EVO.Not knocking Subaru I really do love and recommend them. But I dont like to give people the false impression that its just like owning a Corolla or Accord....,BMW,cx9ogai,1,t5_2qn3a

5912166,0,t3_3w9e9i,If its an automatic make sure you do the transmission servicing at k miles and every k miles afterwards I personally service the transmission in my E i every k miles. The ZF automatics that BMW uses can be a lot of fun but they are a nightmare when they need repairs. As others have said the oil change intervals BMW recommends are way too long and in some cases can cause issues with the VANOS system. I personally change the oil every kk miles oil changes are cheap VANOS system and engine repairs are not. To add and I understand this is overkill but I have all the fluids replaced every year brake fluid power steering differential coolant transmission. Running clean fluids more frequently rather than trying to make your dollar stretch seems like a better investment to me. Dealerships can cost an arm and a leg compared to an independent shop that is certified to work on BMWs.

However the reflective projector housings he got  was for a different year e and so it wasnt a direct drop in but with a bit of ingenuity we made it fit securely in the headlight housing.,BMW,cyck4lm,2,t5_2qn3a

6674154,0,t1_d09linx,There probably wont be a difference in code between the coil and the spark plug both will just come back as either misfire in cylinder x or randommultiple misfires depending on how many are bad. Easiest way to test the coil is pull off the cover and switch the coil to a different cylinder and see if the misfire follows it. It take about  mins to switch the coil.

6788923,0,t1_d0lnxuf,A lot of peoples issues with the newer cars is their lack of a connected feel. Some of the older cars most iconically the E M felt like the tires are talking to your hands. So much about the older cars just felt more raw if that makes sense. The new cars are without a doubt still great machines and will blow the older cars out of the water in terms of performance they just lack the character that driving some of the older cars had which is really what gets me connected to a car. I will probably always own an E or E just because I love how they drive.

We arent sure who the owner is and hopefully someone can point us in his direction. As for my M its probably the best car BMW has made in the last  years and I say that after owning an M and an LSB M Coupe. It was a no compromise sports sedan. Its big and its unapologetically fast. I bought mine with k miles and just hit  last Sunday when I changed my oil. I have had minor maintenance and take care of my preventative proactively. VANOS and rod bearing failures are way overblown in the community. Most cars make it to k without serious issues. It is a heavy car and it is fast so suspension bushings tires brakes wear out faster. It can also eat those things for lunch if you push it. I bought mine when I turned  and I have been able to maintain it on my single income without issue. ,BMW,d0wcbls,4,t5_2qn3a

7099676,0,t3_4clo4f,I had the seatbelt sensor issue on my  i.  I spent months clearing codes to reset the airbag lights and idrive warnings myself knowing that the fault would come back as soon as somebody slightly heavy sat in the passenger seat.  I decided to take it to the dealers and just accepted that it would cost me about  to have the mat replaced my car didnt have the recall option.  The dealer however would not replace the mat saying that they have to see  faults before they would consider a replacement Matt.  This was stupid as I told them Id been resetting the code myself!  Anyway after wasting too much time on this I bought the Matt emulator and seatbelt bypass off eBay for less than  fitted it in  mins and have had zero issues ever since.  BMWs tech told me if the light is off and the car believes somebody is in the seat the airbag would deploy I checked that it thought the seat was occupied by not installing the seat belt emulator at first  the warning chime was on until I plugged in the beltinstalled the emulator.  However I have to ensure that a child does not sit in the front seat as the air bag will deploy in an accident.  Morally I should also tell any future purchasers of the car that the emulator has been installed it just take it off again.My advice is get it fixed on the recall but get a mat emulator and clear all codes in the short term.  You can get bow readers for about  on Amazon if you want to clear codes yourself.Final note is that these Matts seem to get damaged very easily and somebody kneeling on the seat can break them so be careful when you do get it fixed!Welcome to the world of bmw ownership lol,BMW,d1l4b97,1,t5_2qn3a

7381630,0,t1_d2g4d3a,I went in the dead of winter which was an oversight on my part. I was trying to order the car in December to get the best deal. I landed in Munich picked up the car the next day and spent the whole day touring BMW Welt Factory and Museum. Then I drove to Fssen through the Alps following a route recommended on bimmerpost.  I stayed there for a couple nights to checkout out Neuschwanstein Castle which was awesome. I HIGHLY recommend it if youre into all that medieval jazz. Then I drove back to Munich on the  Autobahn through a different route. Stayed in Munich for an extra day to checkout more of the city then flew home the day after that. I really wish I would have stayed more but I have some other plans this year and I only have  vacation days. Schwangau the town right next to Fssen was absolutely beautiful with literally everything covered in snow. I had to stop a couple of times to take pictures and just take it all in.

7424603,0,t3_4gzo3d,This car will use coils instead of wires but you can still do the typical tuneup with relative ease.  Just keep in mind that the coils may be having trouble but your local Autozone should be able to get them if you live in a major city.  Besides plugs and an oil change Id look at replacing the valve cover gasket fuel filter air filter and cabin air filter.  Maybe change the accessory belts too but check the tensioner and pulleys too.  Now would be a good time to familiarize yourself with the key system that is the bane of all BMWs  the cooling system.  Check the engine cooling fan for cracks or chipped blades test the fan clutch and consider replacing it.  I would strongly consider changing the thermostat and water pump too unless thats been done recently and flush the entire system to see how dirty the coolant looks.  If the fuel pump is original and well past k miles it may be due for replacement and could be the cause of actingup  Ive not seen injectors go bad BUT the seals around the injectors do go bad and could be causing a vacuum leak.,BMW,d2m4nhd,3,t5_2qn3a

When you put the spacer on youve effectively removed the centering hub. At the same time mm spacers are so thin there really isnt meat for a machined hub to stand out on so mm spacers dont typically have a centering hub. ,BMW,d39o796,1,t5_2qn3a

This to me is a musthave package the regular headlights are quite crappy.  Also angel eyes.  ZPP Premium Package keyless entry sunroof Sirius lumbar support leather.  Many cars are ordered with leather but without the premium package so just because it doesnt have ZPP doesnt mean its SensaTec BMWs fake leather.

8122342,0,t3_4qfk0j,E M? Welcome to the wonderful world of Maintenance ! Sounds like the biggest issue here is you need to replace your battery. Unfortunately that will require coding so its not a simple just bring it to PepBoys kind of thing. Batteries are usually good for about  years depending on the load on them. I personally usually replace mine in all my cars around the  year mark. Honestly if youre not a DIY person an out of warranty M car is absolutely not for you if youre maintainence budget is that for a Prius. Theyre expensive and they can be fragile. Since your car is  Months old you can still get an extended service contract through BMW Financial Services. You will pay a premium for purchasing it AFTER the original warranty expired however it shouldnt be a problem. I paid about  to extend my i  years and k miles on the Platinum Contract. The car was NOT a CPO and I purchased my ESC while I was still within original warranty. Over  years the car is going to run you about  in maintenance so either its time to get comfortable under the hood and invest in a BM Technic cable or maybe its time to consider a different car. ,BMW,d4t0vn9,1,t5_2qn3a

I can wait the few seconds it takes for them to adjust themselves automatically with the touch of a button.gtWhy does BMW use that automatic gearshift still on new cars? they have  designs now. That ones been around for about  years. Huh.The shifter pictured in OPs vehicle is the base automatic shifter. The smaller sportier looking one with leather grip and base is the optional Sport Automatic Transmission and adds paddle shifters to the steering wheel as well as Sport mode. It may or may not have more aggressive shift patterns as BMW claims it improves acceleration. If not for the imaginary performance the small premium to pay for the better looking and feeling shifter and paddle shifters alone is worth it to me.,BMW,d4wdinp,3,t5_2qn3a

8401218,0,t1_d5rodso,The valve cover gasket was a pretty easy job its just time consuming. I actually didnt have much of a problem with the gasket being dry rotted I actually wasnt sure why it was leaking because the gasket seemed fine nevertheless I replaced it and it fixed the smoking issue I was getting coming from the back of my engine bay.Im not too sure if the cooling system will need a complete overhaul Im quite new to this as well just like you so Im still learning. So far I havent had any issues with my cooling system other than the small leak. At the same time though idk what service the previous owner did to my car. But yeah check for any cracks. One of the most common things youll find on the e models is cracks in the intake boots past the mass air flow sensor. They will cause vacuum leaks which will make the car run lean. Thats actually one of the things Im going to be fixing on my car. Previous owner may have cleared check engine light before selling it to you so if your check engine light hasnt already came up dont be surprised if it does. Its not uncommon on es. Most likely itll be codes p and p which is usually caused from a vacuum leak the air intake boots I was talking about. Definitely buy an OBDII to check any engine codes. If its only one of those two codes youll probably need to replace an O sensor.But yeah most of the things you said in your last paragraph in the op are pretty simple brake pads are definitely an easy job to do by yourself.

9376976,0,t3_58wv8o,I just bought a  CPO X for some of the same reasons so let me try to help....  You can only get the backup camera with navigation. You want to look for something called the ultimate package that would give you everything you listed in .  This package bundled the nav with the premium package keyless entry leather more and the backup camerapark distance control for a discount over ordering them separately about the only option discount ever offered by BMW LOL.  Be careful it was possible to order the nav system and NOT get the backup camera.  If you find an X with nav but WITHOUT keyless entry i.e. no premium then it likely also does not have the camera because then it would have been cheaper to order the ultimate package.  Just make your life easy and look for the ultimate package.. Not a V a turbo inline .  Its a hell of an engine in that car but worse MPG and a bit worse reliability.  Also likely a bit harder to find at this point.. Dark brown called Terra in BMW speak was only available with the xLine package and even then it was an option so finding them is harder. I saw one in my search a few months ago.  There are cars out there with Ultimate  xLine w terra but more rare.  Great combo if you can find it.   sDrives were the cheapest models so they may have been optioned up more infrequently.  X is a great BMW to buy right now because of newer model FWD does not drive as well but is larger and with airbag recall they are piling up on lots and can be gotten at a significant discount.  Its also likely to be one of the more reliable BMWs as the tech is old but very proven at this point in its lifespan e has been sold since  and the e sedan where many of the parts come from has been sold since .  Plus as you note this is a pretty unique BMW. They will likely never sell a hatch like this in the states again.  I love mine as does my wife.  We only have two kids however.  I strongly doubt you can get three car seats even three boosters in the back.  Two is no problem but I did pick up a narrow with booster to make fitting my  year old in a bit easier. The  cyl N engine in the x has sometimes had timing chain issues so Id prefer to own it CPO but Im not worried about it.Any other questions? ,BMW,d94ljiq,3,t5_2qn3a

9416932,0,t1_d98b8yy,Unfortunately not not beyond the odd bastardized slang word x How common are LMs there? I like those Apex the concave is nice and I feel like they look like actual race wheels. Was considering a set of RCs myself.Ill have to see if I can find myself some in that case..The Msport shock will certainly do when putting in a pair of lowering springs especially if in decent condition but I can speak for the ride quality much. I imagine it wears them much faster. I had lowering springs on Msport shocks but the fronts had next to no dampening left in them when I got the car. Was bouncy as hell.  If its manufacturer specd  for stock I wouldnt see any problems though. Ive considered many kips and splitters definately appreciate the shape of the ACS bumper lip. Its as low as I can practically go on the street but will add a custom removable front splitter in future. I like the GT lip on Msport solong as its in fairly mint condition,BMW,d99ntqd,1,t5_2qn3a

If they were unable to align due to a bent shock they never should have attempted to align the measurements could be off.  If they didnt express to you that they were unable to correctly align it could be that they are trying to cover their asses.   I would investigate a bit further with the manager trying to get more information or paper work regarding the alignment and why an alignment was charged if they couldnt align it.

You can spray the back as well  Plastidip peels off with a bit of effort after it dries pressure washing works the best Ive found.To get the back I would spray the back in a few thin coats first then flip them over make sure there is no buildupdrips then spray the finish coats on the front.  Takes a little longer but if you want both sides covered thats how I would approach it. edit make sure you tape off anywhere the part needs to mountPlastidip is like viscous paint once you spray it and it solidifies to become a bit malleablerubbery.
