5164906,0,t1_cv8k8tn,tldr It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know. That said. In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it. Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan. I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories. Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it. I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things. I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that. Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments. And uh Im a pretty good moderator. All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,RotmgCircleJerk,cv8k9bx,1,t5_2v88w
