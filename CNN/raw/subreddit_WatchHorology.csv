291886,0,t1_cfab2pg,Im a professional horologist myself but I see no harm in hobby horology so long as its practiced on watches that are expendable. So perhaps the best advice is to not work on watches that are really wanted to be looked after. ,WatchHorology,cfb0ofw,4,t5_2t4jd

2448198,0,t3_2ngzjv,Do you have your CW and SAWTA or just CW? I only ask because most industry people I have talked with a couple instructors from different schools excluding lititz multiple watchmakers independent and at service centers have all shit all over the SAWTA program. Quite a few people on the Young Watchmakers Group on Facebook have talked about hiring and subsequently firing SAWTA graduates for being overly confident and overlyinept at simple tasks and Ive heard from some people at different service centers that the SAWTA students usually washout in a few months. I know that Lititz NSCC and OSU are RolexSAWTA affilated but I dont know if what I am hearing is true or politics. Any insight? ,WatchHorology,cmeav6i,1,t5_2t4jd
2682250,0,t3_2qq224,Would it not be simpler to just take auto version and swap out the the dial and hands with the ones from the quartz version? Looks like thats the only cosmetic difference between the two apart from the thickness.,WatchHorology,cn8ov85,1,t5_2t4jd
2854701,0,t3_2ssld8,You mean to practice on? My suggestion would be a lot of  or so with cases dials hands and glass. Something like this isnt bad but its going to be hard to find replacement parts for brands like that. Shouldnt cost more than about  a watch. If you have the complete watch you might be able to get it restored to working condition. Of course if you just want to practice with tools and break things plain movements are cheaper and you can find bigger lots.,WatchHorology,cnskwaa,1,t5_2t4jd
2866629,0,t3_2spzem,Google watch dial templates download some print them out on transparency film and start putting on the markers.  These can be resized to how big your dial is.  There are also many different styles if you have not already decided on what you want your dial to look like.,WatchHorology,cntxq6h,1,t5_2t4jd
2866641,0,t3_2sy6mi,Ive been a huge fan of watches now for several years and have recently taken into writing about my passion so I would really appreciate some honest comments criticism and feedback about my articles. Thanks everyone.,WatchHorology,cntxry8,1,t5_2t4jd

3374262,0,t1_cpcrcmh,Totally fair. I like skimming the furthest extents of the hobby or field Im studying before I dive deep but youre right that diving right into the easier pieces might be better for a lot of people.Its easy to get trapped in the Im totally a watchmaker because I can take apart and put this movement back together trap though when theres so much more to it!,WatchHorology,cpcw2sg,1,t5_2t4jd

7548373,0,t3_4iq53g,Im no expert but Im an engineering student so I deal with some of this stuff. Both battery types are the same voltage so in theory they should both work. However there may be some other factors at play which I cant help you with.The unit mAh milliAmp hour is a unit of charge which means it basically represents the number of electrons stored in the battery which can be discharged or the battery capacity. It measures the same thing as the Coulomb only the Coulomb represents a different amount. mAh is really just a bastard unit that is used for convenience. A battery with lower capacity will not last as long as a battery with higher capacity for a given discharge current Amps. Your high drain type battery can sustain a higher discharge current without melting or leaking or otherwise becoming compromised.Unfortunately something else must be at play to cause the rate of your watch to be so far off. I would recommend the  battery because thats whats recommend engineers know what they are talking about. Maybe it just needs to be adjusted.,WatchHorology,d307p9r,2,t5_2t4jd
