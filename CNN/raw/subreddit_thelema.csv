2586766,0,t3_2pbpkb,Historically the reason for the natural colors being that way goes back to the Minutum Mundum diagram.  This was a diagram which was shown to the new  in the old Golden Dawn during the Adepts Minor ritual.  The diagram would have been the first color drawing of the Tree of Life that the new adept would have been exposed to sort of like Dorothy in Oz opening up to a new world of color.  In the early GD all of the color information was secret and not disclosed till .  The impact would have been tremendous.  The magical use of color was one of the most closelyguarded magical secrets of the Golden Dawn Inner Order and one of their biggest innovations.  Also those King Scale path colors were the ones the new adept used to paint the Lotus Wand RC Lamen etc.  In that diagram which is pretty much the same colored Tree you find all over the place the Sephiroth are colored in Queen Scale and the Paths in King Scale.  Practically King Scale is used when magically you want a force to be radiating out which is what the Paths do.  Queen Scale is used for when you want to attract or draw a certain force which is what the Sephiroth do.  Speaking roughly this is the same reason why in the Z document the application of the Neophyte Formula to the consecration talismans falls under Heh initial you are creating an attractor or magnet.  Sephiroth kind of naturally act like that as containers.Gorgeous art by the way!,thelema,cmw882t,2,t5_2r7og
3053584,0,t1_coefeme,There isnt any single pyramid square for The Chariot because the system just doesnt work like that.  Now on any given Tablet you do see three squares of the Linea Dei Patris thats the vertical line just to the left of the center the one that also has the Jupiter and Mercury seniors that are loosely associated with the zodiac sign of Cancer.  The position of these three squares moves on each of the four Watchtowers but they will always be somewhere on the Linea Dei Patris because thats the line for the Cardinal Signs.GDstyle neoEnochian is stupidly complex and honestly its just not a good place to start learning.  I mean Regardie initially published that book because he was afraid the GD was dying out and wanted to make sure that did not happen so he published whatever he had.  The result was that higherlevel material got included material that requires a solid foundation in the Outer Order stuff in order to make any sense of it.If your goal is to understand The Chariot for instance then why not just study about the card and meditate on it directly?  Just use the card itself and consider the attributions in .  If you want to understand the GD Enochian Tablets you might check out Tabatha Ciceros The Book of the Concourse of the Watchtowers.

3934473,0,t3_35inhk,  The notion of a dynamic self was laid out by Crowley himself in several places.. In one of the Holy Books of Thelema known as Liber Cordis Cincti Serpente vel LXV it is written Am not I the flying spark of light whirled away by the great wind of your perfection? Crowley comments on this line He understands himself not as a fixed being of wrath but as the the flying spark of light  a pure dynamic vibration. This conception first formulated in Liber CCXX and explained already in this Comment is in fact the first condition of what the Buddhists call Samma Dithi  right views. So long as a man thinks of himself as a being rather than as an energy he attributes to himself not as the profane suppose stability but stagnation which is death. . One is further enjoined in Thelema to identify with the principle of eternal energy the Infinite Motion of Things the central core of all being Law of Liberty which is called Hadit a symbolic idea that is often depicted as a winged sun that is common in Egyptian iconography. . We have the same idea repeated elsewhere change is life stagnation death we should not fear a brisk metabolism Amrita. Finally in Duty he writes This True Self thus ultimately includes all things soever its discovery is Initiation the travelling inwards and as its Nature is to move continually it must be understood not as static but as dynamic not as a Noun but as a Verb.gt It seems to me that the selfhood is obliterated in reducibly monist philosophy and mystical oneness.Usually. This is the distinction between infinite will and finite will or None and Two. I actually wrote a very brief essay on this very topic and also another brief one on a similar topic In Thelema we acknowledge the obliteration of self or seeingthrough of  the illusion thereof in monistic consciousness while also recognizing the relative validity and importance of self in the normal sense. That is we know both our identity with the OneTaoAll as well as our own unique individual contingentinterdependent place within that All. The former half is denied by those who ignore mysticism and the latter half is ignored by most mystics. gt We could understand this as complete embrace of the cosmological process that operates independently of the Will. Two virtues of the sage are wuwei noncoercive action the dude abides and wuzhi no mind. This may suggest a completely external locus of control.I do not think that the locus of control becomes external with wuwei and wuzhi. They are external to the normal discursive controlling mind but they still spring from a spontaneous source within. You could say that it springs from a spontaneous union of a place deep within oneself with the environment as well and the same basic meaning is retained. In Thelema we have a notion of Will that transcends our basic wishes wants and willpower as well as beyond our discursive mind  fairly identical to the Taoist notion although the Taoists define it negatively i.e. not that. As Thelemites we are especially on guard of relegating our locus of control to outside of ourselves including notions of what that supposed outsideofourselvesTaothing is supposed to be up to and therefore guiding our behavior in yet another more nefarious and subtle way of giving up our own choice and responsibility. gt If we are going to use a Thelemic interpretation it seems that this second reading is required. What do you think?Again not necessarily. I dont quite fully grasp your second point either. Essentially the Will of Thelema is not the typical will that one gives up in mysticism  that is personal will or egoic will or whatever you want to call it. This Will of Thelema is in harmony with or is entirely one with the cosmological process sometimes called the Universal Will or Tao or whatever. gt Perhaps we can correlate Dao with Nuit. I think that correlating the sage with Hadit and and Dao with Nuit opens up Daoism for some interesting Thelemic interpretations. Thats one way. The clearest conception I can think of is that Tao is ultimately Nuit and Hadit as they are all inexpressible nondual ideas. Crowley made Tao equivalent to negative veils and Teh equivalent to Kether or the Tree of Life as Taomanifested. Nonetheless Hadit is ultimately within each individual and it would make sense to say the sage is identified therewith. Attributions are not  anyhow.gt My main concern with correlation however is that for the most part Laozhuang Daoism holds that Dao is not a conscious process.I think any Taoist would agree with you and I think many Thelemites would acknowledge that Will is such a nonconscious process as well or at least is not limited thereto.gt This could mean that the attribution of Nuit and dao is an anthropomorphizing of an unconscious cosmological process that works as a pragmatic concept however Daoism would warn against such conceptualizing. On the contrary I believe that conceptualizing the ineffable is a necessary step in pointing our primate minds in the right direction. Thoughts?Thelema also warns against such things.

7858874,0,t1_d3z3y5e,The passage in question also goes on to say that Qi Gong Master have been tested under scientific conditions and tested with certain instruments to detect certain energies emit from them that do not emit from common man. At the bottom of the excerpt I shared with you a link that confirms these findings.To illustrate this further take a look at this passage from Zhuan FalunWhats beyond the Five Elements about? Our ancient Chinese physics and our modern physics both acknowledge that the Chinese theory of Five Elements is correct. Metal wood water fire and earththese Five Elements form the myriad things in our universe. This is fact and thats why we talk about these Five Elements. When someone says that a person has gone beyond the Five Elements in todays language it means going beyond this material world of ours. Sounds hard to believe. But lets think about something. Qigong masters have gong. Ive been tested and lots and lots of other qigong masters have been tested this way tootested for energy. A lot of the instruments that we have today can detect the material elements in gong so in other words if theres the right instrument the elements emitted by qigong masters can be detected. Nowadays the instruments can detect things like infrared rays ultraviolet rays ultrasonic waves infrasonic sounds electricity magnetism gamma rays atoms and neutrons. Qigong masters all have these forms of matter and some other matter emitted by qigong masters cant be detected since theres no such instrument. But as long as you have the right instrument these can be detected and theyve discovered that the matter emitted by qigong masters is extremely rich.Under the effect of a special electromagnetic field qigong masters can have strong luminescence and its really beautiful. The higher a persons potency the larger the energy field he projects. Ordinary people have one too but its a really weak kind of luminescence. People who do research in highenergy physics think of energy as being things like neutrons and atoms. A lot of qigong masters have been tested. And all the qigong masters who are pretty wellknown have been tested in fact. Ive been tested too and they found that I emit gamma rays and thermal neutrons  times greater than the radiation of normal matter. At that point the needle of the testing instrument had hit the limit and since the needle had hit the maximum point they couldnt tell exactly how strong it was. Imagine neutrons that strongits just incredible! How could a person emit neutrons that strong? This proves that we qigong masters do have gong it proves we do have energy. Its been verified by the scientific and technological community.The guy I am quoting is Master Li Hongzhi the founder of Falun Dafa and the author of Zhuan Falun who has one awards the world overBy April  Mr. Li Hongzhi had received over  awards and proclamations from Australia Canada China before crackdown Japan Russia and the U.S. in recognition of the extraordinary contributions to peoples spiritual and physical health and to freedom of belief in the world. These include certificates of recognition from several governmental bodies in the United States  including Honorary Citizenship awarded by The State of Georgia and city of Atlanta. On  March  The Freedom House bestowed Li Hongzhi and Falun Gong with an International Religious Freedom Award for the advancement of religious and spiritual freedom at a ceremony in the United States Senate. In the same year Li was ranked the most powerful communicator in Asia by Asiaweek magazine for his power to inspire to mobilize people and to spook Beijing. He was nominated for the  Sakharov Prize by over  members of European Parliamentwas nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in  and  and in  was ranked by Foreign Policy Magazine as one of the  most powerful people in the world.source ,thelema,d3zeph7,0,t5_2r7og
7890790,0,t1_d42wvfq,Im familiar with the brain stimulation experiments you mentioned its extremely interesting stuff. I would say at least for some people we already have religious hallucination pills  namely psychedelic drugs. Contemporary psychedelics while usually awesome IME do definitely have drawbacks and hazards and a higher level of development here would be a fantastic tool.Speaking of psychedelics I think they can inform us to the fact that something much more than discrete experiences is needed here. I used to experiment quite heavily with them including high!dose LSD trips during which I would do meditation and ritual to push the experience further in a spiritual direction. I achieved intensely blissful and spiritual experiences multiple times with this method. However my ultimate conclusions after reviewing my experiences were that while seemingly profound at the time they were of limited utility. Any lasting effects were either transitory or far too subtle to constitute actual attainment. This can be observed in the psychedelic community which is chockfull of people who thing they have reached enlightenment but are in actuality delusional wrecks.Why should that be the case? My theory is that the mental discipline development of raw willpower and daytoday immersion characterizing traditional methods of attainment are just as important if not more so than spiritual experiences themselves.  Drugs or other technologies that would augment a persons mental control and awareness in ways parallel to how concentration and mindfulness meditation techniques develop mental power will be critical if this is ever going to pan out in my humble opinion. We really are trying to reengineer the brain in some sense so that we can break away from the constraints and illusions that biology and social conditioning try to impose upon us. ,thelema,d42zxqn,2,t5_2r7og
7920735,0,t1_d3dzqzf,Unlike the USA most European countries dont have a innate right to religious freedom  for example in Ireland the Roman Catholic Church is the established official religion as is the Anglican Church in the England.Also countries like the UK have extremely strict laws about exposing children to anything which could even vaguely be considered sexual and a naked woman certainly could fall into that category. That would mean anyone responsible for a minor attending that event would have a very real chance of ending up in jail and being labelled a child sex offender for life. And the parents losing custody of their own child.And thats not some pieinthesky possibility. I know of one particular case in Europe where exactly this was legally threatened and lawyers involved. Luckily that local body had an explicit and strict policy of no minors at Mass otherwise there was a very real danger that people would have ended up in court.So most EU OTO bodies have a strict no minors policy and rightly so. Personally I absolutely would not attend if there wasnt such a policy and I would strongly recommend others do likewise.I know some people are going to choke on that but yknow whatever. You can take the risk of going to jail if you want but dont expect me to sanction you risking other peoples liberty.

But I dont think they are the means of the system. Its the Work itself and the guidance of a teacher that really matters and gets results.  I do not get a sense of apostolic style spiritual transmission being a part of the system the A..A.. The documents which founded the order make clear that its the Work of the A..A.. and the law of Thelema that give the Order its efficacy. While there might occur chains of initiation they are not an end to themselves. Furthermore theres a history of teachers in the A..A.. system being changed for multiple reasons ex. Crowley taking Achad as his personal pupil after he took the oath of the abyss.  I wasnt aware of there being a governing triad in Shoemakers group.  Thanks for the info. gtI wont really address whether a teacher has the authority to expel a student other than to note that if the student accepted the authority of the teacher to initiate or otherwise admit them as the only authority available to them then a later rejection of that authority may throw doubt on the legitimacy of the admittance or initiationOnly if you assume that the fleshandblood person who initiated you is the means via which one becomes initiated.  I do not believe this to be the case.  Its ones own Will and the guidance of ones Angel which leads one on that inward path of initiation.  The teacher is there to assist you on that path and help you avoid pitfalls but they are not the gatekeeper aside from the very specific ways in which they evaluate the Work and tests described in Liber  amp . And the specific roles they may play in physical initiations.  Still even in the later case they are only as effective in as much as they are representative of a greater Truth.   If that teacher becomes unavailable for whatever reason death leaving the Order etc. then another assigned teacher can assist the aspirant on their path.  Ones path doesnt end because their teacher chose to exercise their Will in a particular way.  ,thelema,d607q34,2,t5_2r7og

10077158,0,t1_dbl0a1j,This is my suggestion to you one day I will write more on the importance of our relationships to such chemicals But first of all if we are going to have a relationship with a chemical which just by the fact that you and a chemical exists means you have a relationship with it even if you never truly met But first of all honor the chemical for what it is do not place it low in your mind Part of the issue is that we do not respect what we are dealing with and thus cannot truly observe its nature because we are dealing with our judgements upon rather than with the substance itself Mind altering substances which everything in a sense is contain vital points we call drugs and this just got soooo much more expansive with RC chemicals Create a certain range of symptoms that are in a sense the exact same for everyone however there is a dance between our personality and their effects and this dance begins even at the chemical level so the same thing can effect people quite differently My suggestion to you is to study what the effects are And to generally remember that these drugs tend to exaggerate certain aspects of our self whether seemingly positive or negative and so this is quite the respectable path in self realization if we keep in mind that we are learning something of a dance with a state or ourselves this allows us to work with ourselves in deeper aspects by extruding certain aspects of ourselves to be dealt with in a sense more directly Now I am not saying to continue use but that discontinuing use should not have to be a struggle however at the same time this is not very well supported in society so it is something of an idealistic statement But this outlook though I cannot tell you your own true goal in it should help you realize the living aspect of this the living nature it is quite directly related to Carlos Castanedas method of gaining an ally in a chemical substance Because essentially what we really need to remember is that this dance is already going on these things allow us to see the dance differently and can learn to carry that same dance in sobriety or what I would more call a functional equilibrium of all systems involved but this is a living system and that is important More importantly these chemicals especially ones well revered really do have a spirit that can be communicated with Though in psychedelics this can appear generally much more straightforward for it can truly be clear when the spirit is being direct with you if it so chooses to make itself known.. This doesnt mean you cant have a good relationship with it without such a direct defining way.. But that if you should find yourself in such a direct relationship the spirit has truly found you worthwhile in working with enough to teach you the ways of itself instead of letting you stumble down its corridors With that I hope something useful and profound might be obtained in your own journey But a major importance is what we choose to honor and if our actions align with the intent of that honor It is a very sick thing to put down what you yourself crave this is a source of splitting your own consciousness When your own body craves something than your body is placing it higher than your mind does or your mind is placing it higher than your body does Or many different conflicts can emerge any time you get high and place that high in a low position It is also important to say that if you think that you do not get anything out of it cuz it has destructive consequences around you ask yourself how truly destructive they are or if people around you do not honor you well enough to not destroy who you are in that moment That is when the system or society is dealing with the idea of you and  not who you are because you are your own choices right? even if you dont feel you have control that is your experience  ,thelema,dbl2pco,2,t5_2r7og
