64420,0,t3_1utyv3,Harmless is a strange word because even the dullest of spoons is still a lethal weapon. Even the most harmless SCP is still potentially leagues more deadly than a loaded assault rifle in the hands of an angry chimp.The reason why theyre still contained is because we simply dont understand them. Take SCP for example. Its an image that causes you to smell flowers by scratching it. This is possibly the least lethal thing in the entire SCP collection. But what if it causes explosions when coming into contact with a specific minority? What if it knocks  years off your life just by sniffing it? What if its the reason SCP is angry at mankind?They are contained no matter how safe or dangerous because we simply dont understand them. Much like my ExWifes Mother.,SCP,celrijg,14,t5_2r4ni

I imagine researchers are assigned x DClass to use for SCP y or Project z and have to requestdont get any more.One would imagine theyd record the deaths of Dclass if they were of significance.  If the thusfar placid and quite charming sentient filing cabinet suddenly tore off Ds head when he tried to open two of its drawers at once then that would be of note.  If the housesized maneating sloth reached down and grabbed yet another Dclass it would get a note if only to track how many Dclass theyve got left to play with.Id say that it is up to the head of the site to allocate Dclass as and when they are needed and for their thenproctors the researchers to keep track of them dying.  I doubt however that that information would then be passed back up to heads of site for a big ol Weve killed X Dclass! statistic to go on newsletters alongside an announcement of a raffle and news regarding the retirement of Dr Poopants.

Perhaps it actually looks like a black skinny body that is barely covering a skeleton and the skin is constantly bubbling and giving out a black cloud of dissolving tissue.For the skin itself in escape modenormal mode it would have change to look like a large lizard hard scales and spikesblades for protection and offensive uses.So in normal mode it should look more like a mix between a raptor and a cheetah with biting to be the main attack and clawingspikingspinning body slam to be secondary attacks.Actually now I think about it mother nature has already designed the perfect lizardlike human killing machines in the form of a raptor so in conclusion I think  should look a lot like a raptor with a lean body shape covered in sharp scales and spikes and blade fins.Suddenly this  looks more and more convincing.,SCP,chxn5yx,2,t5_2r4ni

1645654,0,t3_2d3mec,Hey guys! Whats really funny is that me and uBowlOfSalsa have been working on this for the past couple of weeks and we are planning on opening it by Saturday.We use a roleplaying script called Clockwork which is bloated with many cool features that overhaul most of default Gmods clunkiness. Players can assume the roles of all factions and classes ranging from DClass to MTF.Heres how it works we already have DClass set as a default faction. Players upon joining will be established as DClass and will be evaluated by staff for their roleplaying capability. This style of administration coupled with the fact that there is already a quiz system for new players will ensure that  no little kiddies who have no concept of roleplay will be able to join and ruin things for everyone. After that the next easiest faction will probably be researcherscientist followed by Agent positions.So far we are a small operation but there is lots of room for aggressive expansion. We have a steam group below that you can join for event information and other server related goodiesSchema communitylore thread on the roleplaying frameworks website Content collection that you can subscribe to in the meantime so you can see all the maps weapons and models without issue Keep in mind that EP and CSS content is needed for the optimal experience of no errors however it isnt required.Add me on steam Salsas steam Also OP if you can give us a bit of mention in the OP that would be really cool!About the map we currently use Ineu Pass which is a small soviet bunker surrounded by plenty of badlands for combat and missions.

My original post was just personal speculation about a side of the story I hadnt previously considered.As far as Ive observed people are just remarking that hes a good sport for not issuing a DMCA takedown when he was fully within his rights to do so. If you want to interpret that as god worship well thats your prerogative. For what its worth I think youre also a good sport for having that attitude about people using your work. The point of my reply was that sentimental ART emotions aside there are legitimate business reasons to disallow this kind of thing. I make my living as an artist and like you Id be happy to see people sharing and interpreting my work. However I think a line has to drawn at some point and if Kato had felt like that line had been crossed with  I wouldnt have blamed him. Its possible that you didnt mean it this way but statements like he should be glad he gets attention come across as derisive and somewhat entitled. He really shouldnt have to be happy about the attention if it has a negative impact on him. If thats not what you originally meant though then I apologize for making a big deal over nothing. ,SCP,cken0gw,9,t5_2r4ni

SuitSat of article  SuitSat sfw gtIn a move originally planned for December   SuitSat entered its own independent orbit just after  UTC on February   when it was taken on a spacewalk from the International Space Station by Valeri Tokarev and Bill McArthur as part of an unrelated spacewalk. Voice messages recorded by the teams involved and by students from around the globe were continuously broadcast in a number of languages from the SuitSat along with telemetry data. The signal began transmission approximately  minutes after SuitSat was jettisoned and was relayed by equipment on board the ISS.

1972934,0,t3_2h6tls,How to make the perfect SCP for me Fuck with the format. Ive never met a format screw I didnt like. Keep it easy on the horror. I dont like getting too spooked. Weird stuff that you can do weird things with gt a thing that will kill you IMO. Dont rely on censoring. Dont get me wrong it can be used in ways that I like but I kind of have to groan when I see DATA EXPUNGED in almost all cases. I get that the idea is your mind will come up with the scariest thing for you but my imagination is awful and I end up going to the comments to see some other peoples headcanons so I dont feel like there was a chunk of the article that was just missing. Tie it in with AWCY? somehow. I know theyre kind of polarizing you love them or you hate them. I love them. Make me laugh. The wiki is not a comedy site and I get that. I dont read an entry expecting to find it funny unless its a J of course. But sometimes you can work humour in there in a way that works with the format. The easiest way is to have the object itself be ridiculous A space wizard commanding a squad of cyborg catgirls! A toaster that makes it impossible to not use firstperson pronouns when referring to me! The fact that until recently no one in any way involved with the Foundation had ever heard of Yellowstone National Park! These are all real entries on the wiki and I love all of them but there are other ways. Dont hide the point behind clues and riddles. Let me be straight with you Im not very smart. It really sucks to read an entry and say I know I missed something but I cant figure it out and have everyone in the comments talk about how cool it was when it clicked for them. It never clicks for me Im sure theres more but thats all I can think of for now.,SCP,ckqxtbu,11,t5_2r4ni

Itd be cool to have the choice to invest in more private corporations so as time goes on youre less dependant on the nations as the nations are on you thats how I think of it in my own head cannon anyway. What would be really cool especially is if the foundation had key parts to play in real historical events such as the cold war and the break up of the soviet union giving you a secret back story to the events and even choices on what to do perhaps even creating an alternate timeline. Also a tech tree for research would be nice and as time goes onyou develop better tech the menusUI could change to reflect your progress E.g. a more metallic or clipboard slide outs for the menus to start out with and then as you progress it could change to old computer monitors and then to how you have them now.

2641532,0,t1_cn384ny,The Lox exist on a higher level than humans both as physical entities and memetic entities. Thats one of the reasons that humans cant really fully understand them. Adidal wanted to punish Ruhar so he did the whole universal transmission thing to intimidate all intelligent life in the universe. However he obviously didnt know about humans who as it turns out are susceptible to memes. So when Ruhar died his consciousness actually transferred into the eight Dclass who escaped.Now the Lox enter the scene. They take over humans which are the humans speaking in tongues and they are also here physically which are the black humanoids. Theyre searching for Ruhar because Adidal wants him punished. However those eight Dclass who escaped....were shot. So Ruhar actually ended up dying.Now the Lox are stuck taking care of the SCPs.Then theres the religious iteration which is where human society has collapsed after the invasion. Some researchers communicate through the footnotes and combine two SCPs  and  to create a reset button to change everything back. Now there isnt a real consensus as to why these articles exist in the first place if things were reset then either the events didnt happen or they are going to happen or etc. It gets complicated even moreso than it already is. ,SCP,cn3dpma,6,t5_2r4ni

If its a comet or something massive they might just leave it there because theres no other option.  If its a satellite or a creature they could try and bring it to Earth somehow.  How exactly is hard to say especially if its delicate.It partially depends on how advanced your Foundation is  do they have a space station?  Satellites?  Astronauts zipping around?If you want a copout way of getting it to Earth say it crashed into a civilian satellite and The Foundation recovered it due to some unusual activity surrounding the collision or the crash site on Earth. ,SCP,cn4bbad,3,t5_2r4ni

4379116,0,t3_3b4quz,There was a Korean horror webcomic making the rounds on the internet a while ago. Many korean webcomics consist of a very vertically long image representing the chapter instead of individual pages. When you visit the page you scroll down progressively to view the chapter however this page had a script which autoscrolled the page downwards even if you tried to scroll upwards. This combined with the long image format basically acted like a flip book animation except it gave you the feeling of being out of  control which made it more scary and unexpected.Seeing something like that on the SCP wiki would definitely scare me. ,SCP,csj9fh1,7,t5_2r4ni

4705786,0,t3_3fdn1f,Youll never see a show because of how Creative Commons licensing works. No studio is going to produce content they dont have control over and while we may get caught up in our own little niche on the internet the SCP Foundation has zero mainstream weight in terms of popularity. Hollywood could easily make up all the details themselves for a property they fully control and it would have the same audience share right out of the gate. Scratch that theyd have a larger one due to paid advertising.Personally Im glad for that because a show would have a recurring cast I dont think Hollywood would chance a Twilight Zone style anthology show these days and I think what makes the wiki memorable would be lost in trying to focus on a set cast. A lot of the very best SCPs     dont have any characters from the Foundation side of things really involved at all.There are plenty of tales on the every day lives of agents and staff but those arent the main attraction of the site.

As others point out it would take a very strangelyprecise head canon for them not to be very rich by the external economys standards. But if they spend it in the conventional sense theyll cause inflation. Massive masqueradeshattering inflation.At scale you need to think about resource allocation directly. It doesnt matter how many megatons of gold your coffee machine can put out if youre short of people to do some task and theres no more left in the world. Even the Foundation cant buy more than  of some resource and if they try open market prices would shoot up as they did. You have to think about all the interactions like that.Or alternatively ignore the whole problem because it really doesnt much help. As Djoric says they have enough Id add that for dramatic effect they usually have barely enough and maybe not that. What they are short of is not money but researchers and knowledge and other things they really cant buy at scale.NB Im summarizing and being a bit sloppy on purpose.

Im not the only one in this thread that remind you all that other organizations exist.  Although I have made this thread to make sure people are better informed and I would like discussion on them more.  And Im not telling you that you shouldnt like the GOC over the Foundation now am I?You make the argument that the GOC is right from your view I think your argument is lacking in that youre only comparing the GOC to the Foundation.  It would be really great if you can add comparisons about how the GOC is better than the various other GOIs.  For example GOCs mortal enemy the Serpents hand.  Other Governmental GOIs or other religious based GOIs.  I did say GOCs council of  contains Satanists theyre the ones that believe if God exists it is their duty to kill Him.See if youre passionate about the Global Occult Coalition once upon a time they had their own separate site.

It was pretty vivid and it involved me needing to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night but when I stepped in to the hall it was covered by a layer of squirming insects. I woke up sweating. I have a lot of dreams that probably should be nightmares but I dont think they are because my definition of a nightmare is unreal terror and waking up panicking. One dream I was in a organ mill which was as horrific as it sounds like. I was scared during the dream but that part passed and I didnt wake up panicking. Sometimes I have panic dreams which arent nightmares but have me waking up panicking because I cant tell the difference between them and reality.

8940155,0,t1_d7mffmd,The Swords have a loose connection to the Catholic Church the current Knights are an atheist and a Jew. The atheist remains so after literally meeting an archangel but the Sword of Hope doesnt seem to mind. At present the Sword of Love is held in safekeeping by a disciple of Merlin rather than any religious authority so its safe to say that the archangel Uriel is more influential than any particular ordained person in ensuring humanity has its fighting choice.The Catholic Church does have a vital function in restraining the Thirty Pieces of Silver though theres evidence that the organs that perform this function have since been corrupted or rendered otherwise unable to fulfill their duties. The Inquisition is a participant in the Oblivion War but thats mostly administered by the Archive since the Oracle at Delphi days if I understand correctly. The Dresdenverse has seen humanity develop a couple of emergent responses to supernatural threats. Mostly however it relies on the weirdness censor that assumes a vampire attack was just a roidedout junking on a spree or that a faerie brawl was just dudes in costumes. The transportation of a millionyearold fossil a few miles on Halloween night by frat boys for a prank could not have possibly been caused by necromancy polka and someone who advertises in the phone book as a wizard for hire. On the other hand the supernatural community is legitimately terrified of humanity turning off said censor because even an imortal shapeshifting demigod from hell apparently cant do much when its tricked into stepping in to the middle of a nuclear test. ,SCP,d7mh3n7,7,t5_2r4ni

Theyre where the genre was solidified and had a few holdovers from the similar Holders dealie.  had a lot of refinement. The tropes were wearing a little thin and things had to move away from the core idea a little but that bred a lot of innovation in the format.  seems to have a lot more experimentation that either of the previous series with authors really having to stretch themselves to find a place within the evergrowing possible canon. I think its also seeing a lot of expansion on the world.So I suppose it depends what youre following SCP for. The days of Series I have passed.

It can be moved around as a whole just fine but its shape remains an unchanging constant no matter what while in this state. So my answer would be that it should be indestructible while being watched bouncing down the stairs andor lodging itself in the ground.  If the impact is unobserved however I think it shouldnt be that hard to damage it. Hard to say exactly how vulnerable it would be but a  m drop should cripple it at the very least.

10146291,0,t3_5l9agw,A basic sketch of a story this is literally my first attempt ever so sorry if its shit. If anyone with better writing skills than me likes the basic concept feel free to use as much or as little of this as you likeClass SafeContainment Procedure a  km radius around SCP???? should be kept devoid of people at all times. Satellite facility b has been built near the site to oversee containment.Description SCP???? is a large outdoor water tap located near  in the  . It is the true source of the  river. It flows at a rate of m per minute. The output water is pure oxidane to within measurable limits. It has thus been proposed to build a bottling plant at the site of SCP???? to sell distilled water. This suggestion has been placed on permanent blacklist by Dr.  due to concerns that doing so would draw attention to the area.The water exiting SCP???? has no anomalous properties and is quite quickly mineralized by the ground it flows over. However there appears to be no source for this water. Drs.  and  suspect that this is not merely recycling the water but is in fact adding water to the Earth. There has not to this point been any way to prove this. Experiment ????A After moving large enough equipment to the site the screw on the tap was turned precisely . turns clockwise to turn off the water. Pressure was reduced to a trickle at turn  and the additional fifth of a turn completely stopped flow. This was sufficient to examine the tap and determine that there was no means by which water could enter the object. No reports of anomalous effects came from other locations. The water was turned back on after exactly  minutes making the total loss of water to the  river precisely m.Experiment B The screw on the tap was moved anticlockwise to attempt additional flow of water into the river. It was hoped that this would be sufficient to minimize downstream effects of turning off the tap earlier. At precisely  on  August  the screw was turned anticlockwise one full turn. This sent an amazing burst of water down knocking over the    that was being used to turn the screw and sending  personnel down the now flooding river including Dr. . It took  days to get the situation under control during which time the river flooded downstream. The foundation casualty count was  including Dr.  and the overall casualty count was at least . Experiment C An experiment was proposed to open the tap by an additional quarter turn after a long drought in  began to kill crops. The official response is kept sealed but the relevant portion is the following quote from Dr.     Not a chance you ing ! Dont you remember how we  a million people last time we flooded the place? Its far too  risky!Despite official disapproval of the experiment Dr.  led an unofficial team comprised of volunteers to increase the flow of the river. On  January  they succeeded in increasing the flow by  m per minute changing the level of the river. The tap was turned only an additional  turn in order to achieve this leading Dr.  to believe the flow is calculated exponentially by the number of turns. Dr.  was involuntarily removed from this project and disciplinary action was taken against all involved. The tap was left at its new level.Experiment D Several Dclasses were given water directly from SCP???? and from three points between SCP???? and the city of . Group  received water directly from the source. Group  received water from a point  km downstream and Group  received city water from . Each experimental group was broken into the following subgroups subgroup A received only water from the river to replace their normal water intake. Subgroup B received  ml of SCP???? water per day and regular water for the remainder of their diet. Subgroup C were only fed experimental water. Subgroup D were a control who received no different diet. Subgroup E replicated subgroup A with  brand distilled water. Subgroup F replicated subgroup C with the same brand of distilled water.Subgroups c and F all died of malnutrition within  days probably due to drinking distilled water. No anomalous effects were noticed except in subgroup B whose health dramatically improved. ,SCP,dbu2cfr,23,t5_2r4ni

Most of the time when I was writing tales I had to keep tabs open for reference or just wrote about one or two articles that were fresh in my mind at the time.The big deal for writing anything SCP related is having sufficient justification for your choice of anomalies your characters actions and your use of format fuckery to portray a narrative that otherwise cant happen. As long as youre technically competent knowledge of the vast breadth of the setting isnt necessary. Its not so much a setting as a roiling mass of chaos anyway. The trick is to find the right bits to pull together into a pattern that almost works by some set of rules but not quite.Also if you want to play to your audience look at the articles that are most successful written within the last two months.

Very Aijin gtSCPXXXXB has can remove memories from human subjects when instructed to do so by SCPXXXXA.In the second and last paragraph you Mention SCPXXXX A amp B as SCPXXXX without the alphabetic distinction which is a little out of line with the rest of the article. I suggest specifying both A amp B instead of drooping the letters if youre intending to refer to them both.I think one of the others mentioned it but its odd that theyd let XXXXB out and about when they require the cell locked by level  personnel. Maybe strike that part out as outdated or allow him supervised access to a gymnasiumlibrary for good behavior but not just like all the time.  gtAddendum Do not forget that this entity posseses the ability to erase memories. It is only euclidclass but caution must still be exercised. Dr. KleinI like the Idea of an addendum here advising caution which sets up the second addendum nicely.  That said the advise is kind of generic and the foundation has a reputation for taking euclidclass pretty seriously. Just anything more specific or a proposed solution would improve this. Why are  Dclass using the superior class Z mnestics? I feel like you were trying to imply that they were detrimental to the users health but that doesnt come across very well. ,SCP,ddcl3f2,2,t5_2r4ni

Ables spirit was endowed with a sense of righteous revenge roughly speaking. The wiki articles are pretty interesting in and of themselves.

The eventual explanation is that the planet was inhabited by aliens that were very susceptible to radio waves so when humanity started blasting out in the th century they tried to create a shield around their planet to save themselves and accidentally created an everexpanding barrier that cancelled out not just the harmful frequencies but all energy.,SCP,deyrn64,10,t5_2r4ni

A flood happened and this man took refuge on the roof of his house but the water is still rising.  Another man with a boat came by and offered to rescue the man.  But the man said No no I know God will save me.  So he passed up the boat and the flood water is still rising.  Later a helicopter came by and the helicopter pilot offered to rescue the man.  But the faithful man turns it down No no I know God will save me.  So the helicopter left.  As a result the man drowned.  When the man went to heaven and came to God he asked God God why didnt you rescue me?  God answered What?  I sent a boat I sent a helicopterAssuming that God operates the same way in SCP world.
