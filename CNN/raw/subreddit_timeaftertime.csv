11059211,0,t1_dekvmt7,I get that you dont like the show so maybe there isnt much point disagreeing with you but many of your complaints I dont agree with.His friends didnt believe him they were joking around with him about that. They clearly thought he was acting nuts about the whole thing. The only friend that really believed him was Jack the Ripper and that was maybe out of desperation. Security guard should have shot a person inside the musuem? Trigger happy much? Uhm no. They clearly implied the pawnshop owner thought it was stolen offering to skip the paperwork if he came down in price and the hotel desk person saw his wad of cash and thought he was important. Casey Nesitat the youtuber had a blog about staying at hotels without ID about how if you ask nice and tell them a story they usually let you so I think this is quite believable. Were you actually complaining that after he got hit by the taxi he didnt have a conversation with the police? You get hit by a taxi and then have a conversation. I doubt it would be easy.The one thing I agree with is the cellphone and mustache thing. I think though the cellphone thing was to show how clever Ripper was. He maybe watched people emulated them and figured out how to get a prepaid cellphone. Still he was able to get a burner and all that so quick. It was a bit stretched thin. And I only agree with the mustache thing because I thought with hipster culture there was no real need to shave! They would have fit in About the miscellaneous points I disagree again. I know many girls who still have exboyfriends clothes for various practical or emotional reasons. And the sudden entrance thing has happened to me for the exact same reason as the show when someone hears a scream they hope the other person is ok.Anyway you are against the show so I dont know why I bothered to bug you. I just really disagreed. Cheers!,timeaftertime,deljktk,2,t5_3eqy8
