You get Astrub Knight for free and there is a weekly free sidekick rotation.If you gear them youre fine throwing extra crap at it for the most part theyre really useful. I play solo very often Im level  and the difference between having my sidekicks is night and day. The enemies having extra targets means a lot and their damage is nice.Crafting is completely optin. Its extremely basic and requires you to go out and do it. You can learn professions just from talking to the NPCs in Astrub or your home nation.

Dofus has ALOT more content because it has been out for over  years.The only problem with dofus is that it is EXACTLY in the same situation as World of warcraft... since both games have been out for so long nearly everyone is max level and the only real activity is PvP arena  High bosses. Its probably near impossible to find much people to explore the game with from the very start because everyone is already maxd in dofus.At the current state of both games Wakfu is much better alot of people to explore the game with from the very start. Not only that but the game is the sequal to dofus Its a big open world with much better animations and it really feels like you are in the world unlike dofus.,wakfu,ct4y0ce,2,t5_2sbcy

4945129,0,t3_3ima5l,If this is a serious discussion I wonder if you could reference some of the bugs youre noticing maybe with a link to some of the forum posts youre referencing?Ive been playing Wakfu since beta and have experienced my share of bugs but havent ran into any in the past year thats impacted me adversely as to make the game unplayable or to be not enjoyable.The last bug I can remember is when I was attempting to gather Crowned Thistle and due to the spawn mechanics of the temporary quests some of the Crowned Thistle could no longer be interacted with.  I would have to verify if thats been fixed but I havent encountered it as an issue as of late.My point is with all games and software the company isnt focused entirely on changes that they can monetize.  Issues that negatively impact players do get addressed its in their best interest.  A positive gaming experience is how you retain players Ive been playing Ankama games since Dofus was in beta in .Heck some bugs were funny.  You use to be able to as an Ecaflip in Dofus use Felinition on Wabbit Island around walls.  The skill would cause your character to animate as if it were performing a flying kick and since there was a wall...one would expect you to either not be able to do this or you would go over the wall.  Instead your character moved in the flying kick animation all the way around the wall to hit the target.TLDR Stuff gets fixed stuff gets broken...they dont just add money making changes.,wakfu,cuhvg7x,3,t5_2sbcy
5180089,0,t3_3lxq3t,What do you mean by solo kill dungeons? Like who can powerslay through weaker dungeons? Or who has the best shot at soloing a dungeon around their characters level?Powerslayers are DDs with aoe are like Cra Iop xelor eca but they dont have much survibility or sustain so if your slaying power is not powerful enough you cant solo the dungeon. Ussually this means that you cant solo any dungeon unless you are over leveled. but once you are overleveld you can fly through it.Characters that can have the most potential at soloing hard dungeons usually need some sort of way to self heal they ussually also need some mechanics for prolonged survivability. They are ussually well rounded characters that can fill multiple roles so characters like Sadida Osamadas Edit if the new spell deck cra has some self heals im assuming that it is very limited similar to Dofuss air cra.,wakfu,cvae2iu,1,t5_2sbcy

5847814,0,t3_3v7b6j,FireWater Xelor  Seriously consider going trielement. Without air your Tick turns are going to be ! for damage No Aging means youll be overlyreliant on Desynchronization to stay in Tock for temporal freeze bursts you lose a lot of your mobility making your dial positioning less likely to be optimal wo Tempus Fugit and all of the Xelors limited positioning ability wo Underhand. Temporal Distortion is also Xelors best spam skill since our Sandglass nerf.Fire  Definitely take Hand and Temporal Burn Also Temporal Dust and Hydrand if youre committed to going only FireWater. Youll need at least one dedicated positioner to take full advantage of Hydrust combo though. Sac is preferred but you may be able to get by w OsaElio. Avoid Line of Fire like the plague.Water  Definitely take Time Control Sandglass and Clock. Sinistro does have some situational use for area controlblocking L.O.S.creating choke points on certain maps. You might also want to consider Frostbite if you want your Xelor to take the role of APBitchboy. Frostbite is strictly worse than Sandglass as far as damage AP cost and ease of use but giving an ally AP w only DevotionTime ControlSandglass will require you to target multiple enemies due to Sandglass  cast per target limit.Air  Take Aging if you want to take advantage of AgingHandAgingBurn combos on Tick. IMO Tempus Fugit is required for optimal Xelor play as it makes optimal Dial placement important for Devotion so much easier and gives your Xelor the ability to easily get out of melee range. Underhand is also a skill to consider if you want a bit of positioning ability. Distortion can be considered if you want a skill you can cast more than twice and provides Xelors only AirWater synergy. DistortionX gt Time Control Punishment IMO isnt worth it since being changed to allow easy offhour cell casting and decreased damage.Active Skills  take Dial Timekeeper Devotion and Desynchronization. Youll probably also want to keep Mummification in at least one of your deck setups to give your team a resurrection skill when you dont have access to an Eni teammate. Against the Clock is a neat skill that will allow you to automatically warp long distances at the end of your turn especially in combination w Dial and Fugit glyphs but youll have a hard time making room in any deck for it since youll probably always be using  elemental skills and four if not all five of your other actives.Passives order of importaccessibility  Dial Master Rollback Clock Master Save Temporal Prism. Post lvl  you may want to consider dropping Save for Time Theft Temporal Waves Carnage Definitely swap Save for this skill   when it become available or Mechanics Specialist. Select any of the above for your lvl  passive.Int  Max Resistances Max  HP to armor  in Barrier Remainder of points into HP.Str  Max Range Damage then remainder of points in general damage.Agi  Max Ini Max APMP removal then remainder of points in APMP Resistance.Cha  Max Critical Hits max Critical Damage. Remainder of points can go into either damage from behind Resistance from Behind or Critical Resistancemy pick depending on your playstyle.Major  AP Range and Damage Final Damage Reduction MP and damage could also possibly be considered if you insist on not taking advantage of Fugit.,wakfu,cxm6det,2,t5_2sbcy

7226657,0,t1_d1zjabf,Some tips for playing Osa great choice btw p  You have two main builds  Osa specialized into summons or Osa specialized into dragonform. Both can deal a great amount of damage and you can summons in dragon form but summons will hit less to compansate the buff from dragonform.For stats   Int   resistance rest in HP hp into armor is less interesting for osa because your summons will not benefit for it unlike your HP pool Strenght  If you dont play earth branch dragon form which play mostly close combat go  distance then all the rest into damage all Agility  All in dodge so you can get out of melee rather easily if so Chance   crit chance then the rest in crit damage Major  First in Action Point with gobbal set complete at lvl  you can be in ap mode then its a matter of personnal choice  I would say Control as second means more final damage when going dragon with the right passive then Range or Movement.Try to get a bunny as minipet it gives you control which is nice and important for Osa the more control  the more buff you can stack on ally andor summons and it translate in damage buff into dragon form.For a list of summons you can check hereFor which branch of elements you should focus on  Fire is pretty mandatory because it offers the best buff you can apply on allysummons and have very nice damaging spell some in zone. After that you have air which hit hard mostly single target and you have a spell who can offer back of mob to your allies so they can hit harder or earth with great zone but I havent much play with it so I wont comment on it!,wakfu,d1zm7wj,2,t5_2sbcy

8855693,0,t3_51gixs,I personally love Feca. Very flexible class albeit tricky to play effectively. Yes but each elemental glyph spell can only be used  at a time because cooldown and tonic glyph you can have  at any given time. So in total you can only have  elemental glyph   tonic glyph at  time thus control   or  is best.  The elemental no longer affect tonic. The descriptions in wiki or official site is outdated. Believe only the ingame description. The shield icon means buff. Some Feca spells gives buff to players whether offensive or defensive buffs. However if a player already have a buff and a new buff spell is used on said player the new buff will cancel the old buff. Thus you can only have  buff per player at  time.Tips Feca have a few possible playstyles as with all classes you can be totally balancedhybrid player or you can specialize your Feca. I recommend experimenting with spells. When you reach level  they give you chance to restat your character so dont worry if you made mistake before level . THINGS ALL FECA MUST HAVE . Teleportation  allows you to move halfway across the map.. Defensive Orb  the most important defensive spell for personal or teamplay use.Being balancedhybrid playstyle you can use all spells but your stats will be focused on elemental mastery. Possible specializations. Melee Feca The Feca fire spells are good for melee combo. Stats you want high are Lock Hp and Melee Damage.. Long range Feca Almost all Feca spells are good for long range. High stats for Dodge and Range Damage.. AoE Feca which is me! D This Feca will do most damage with glyphs and Aoe spells but its not very flexible and hard to play . High stats for AoE damage.,wakfu,d7cbura,2,t5_2sbcy
