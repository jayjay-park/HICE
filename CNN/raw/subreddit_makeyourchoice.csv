152459,0,t1_cevs5ye,gtA single RGD grenade costs around  US making it highly affordable during a major conflict when many grenades are required. dollars for high quality night vision goggles. dollars for a handgun.None of these purchases are out of the reach of an average citizen.Plus I can read minds so theres lots of ways to earn money if I have to. I could easily get money by gambling. I can loot those I kill. You really dont need batman level resources to fight crime more effectively. gtInvisibility doesnt cover sound so enemies could hear you sneak up on them. That would be risky but if it works it would be really effective.Im already pretty good at walking around stealthily. Its fun sneaking up on people.gtIm not too sure on about the rules regarding telepathy. If you can simply hear surface thoughts of people around without having to target them that would help in avoiding attacks directed at you as you can hear them thinking about attacking you.None of the powers seem to have concentration requirements. I suppose it could have that extra requirement but I wouldnt assume that mind reading unlike all the other powers only works if you concentrate. gtI imagine delving into other peoples mind would require a fair bit of concentration so in active combat that could be risky.Id practice for a while before hand unless there was an emergency to try and find a safe medium. But again it says you hear the surface thoughts of others. As with other powers I think its rather strange to randomly give it a concentration requirement.gtIf youre against enemies that you are prepared for then theres not much they can do to stop you.True.gtIf you were against random enemies it becomes much harder to dominate against them although the tides would still be in your favor. As such I would avoid fighting random enemies. gtAnubiss power only works on possession that they value.It would depend on the person. Since the bullet was a part of the gun and most criminals value their guns and the bullets core role in them I imagine it would have some value to most.

907447,0,t1_ch7b963,But if size werent tied to class or stats everyone should choose the highest class since each increase in class level confers two additional stat points. You could get around this problem by making higher classes costlier.But I think a better more realistic way to go is to allocate stats by sizeclass though maybe on a different scale at least for speed and then allow more ways to modify your stats through various upgrades. Theres not enough stat changing choices currently. So you could have a strong small suit but it would cost more compared to a similarly strong large suit. But yes body type should have a much bigger impact on stats.This reminds me I think a good amendment to this CYOA wouldve been to offer some way to increase resource points either through selling stat pointsfeatures taking on missions or something else. Like you see in a lot of the other CYOAs.I almost chose the capacitor. But as my build suggests I see myself spending most of my time outside my suit. As it is I get three days straight in terms of power. I dont see many situations where I would want to go longer. And the combination of Brain Implant Mycelium II and Collapsible implies that I still get the HUD Communications A.I. and personal energy source while the suit is collapsed into the wrist brace and charging.

If I could use  and takes some negotiation hypnosis con artist seduction and charm based skills all stuff based around convincing people to do what you want then I definitely see myself opening someone up for more and more ridiculous suggestions.I charm them a little implanting little suggestions throughout the meeting reading how they feel and guiding them in the direction I want and by the end of the encounter I could see myself taking near complete control. In the beginning they probably would hand me their wallet and car keys no matter how much I implant those kinds of suggestions. Give me ten minutes charming and not only will they hand them over theyll do so happily and feel good about it later!. . .Yeah I see your point.

1813123,0,t1_ck7mkdh,Your build makes a lot of sense. Actually the more I think about it the more I like it. You would even be able to build a reputation simply by owning a dragon.Rangers traditionally use a bow and are sort of the hunter type. They respect the forest and many have a connection to it and almost all are versed in such arts as stealth tracking rudimentary remedies and healing. Not using a bow is a bit unusual but by no means wrong or against a code of the rangers.Im not quite sure about my morals. Ill probably be quite pragmatic and not worry too much about honor but things like killing children are definitely off the table. Harming the forest is a nono but probably not worth me attacking you. I respect and use the forest but make a point not to worship it. It would likely come down to the general intent of the job.For example Id be fine with tracking down and eliminating bandit camps with any means necessary. If I could rely on my reputation and subtle skills to convince them to disband great. If not the blade and bow for them.Id be more than happy to track someone down for a bounty as long as they were guilty of the crimes. If I was assigned to retrieve a hostage Id do so happily. Woe be unto the captors.But if I were asked to spy on or assassinate a rival empire or army Id have to weigh whether its A ethically right to help the group that asked for my ell and B right to tip the scales one way or another.,makeyourchoice,ck7nsgb,2,t5_2w8em

I see the giant furry paws  and think manticore manticore manticore manticore manticore! No thanks to being enrolled in the school of pain having my ass kicked in by her feet and my feet kicked in with her gigantic ass.Now as with the other monster girl CYOA my plan here is to conquer the territory. Monstergirl? Half devil and half child? Same thing. I have a white mans burden to take up. Unfortunately there arent any options that come with or imply a hive or a village or something and it seems like traces of civilization mostly amount to various ruins where humans might once have lived.Unless you count dwelling in temples instead of the wilderness I think my most civilized option is the Tanuki. She can either acquire or make goods of varying quality otherwise she wouldnt have anything to sell and shes clearly able to find the few individuals in this wilderness who can trade peaceably instead of taking things by violence and living like animals  for what Im trying to achieve thats probably the best possible start as long as Im restricted to just working with a partner. Convincing her to help with my endeavours shouldnt be hard I mean profit is about as far ahead of altruism in my plans as it was for anyone else who claimed to be carrying the white mans burden and even if she doesnt cheat me out of a majority share even half the wealth of a victorianera captain of industry makes a mere travelling merchant look impoverished.Although founding an industrial civilization from whatever local monstergirls we can hire and convince to cooperate is probably still impossible at least at this point. I have a better idea. The intro describes where I am as an isolated continent not a world unto itself so implicitly theres a human civilization out there on the other continents of this world. Must be preindustrial or thered already be colonies here and even the earliest prehistoric citystates would be a better start than some random wild monstergirls for trying to make an industrial revolution go. Or even without such plans any kind of nonwilderness is a better place to set up shop and be a merchant than just some wilderness with occasional sentient monsters who might trade with you although Id probably have to convince the Tanuki of the principle of if you dont screw your customers over theyll come back and trade with you again!So new plan Build a ship. Fuck the monstergirl continent were outta here. Now thats easier said than done but I mean at least this is something we can accomplish with random hired monstergirls and a few miscellaneous items that the Tanuki can probably get her hands on. Then we make a lot of money and start an industrial revolution in the first human realm we find. Then and this steps probably like ten or twenty years down the line we send possibly lead an expeditionary force to establish a colony.And then we quest for immortality most likely seeking out the Apophis and seeing if shes willing to trade her potions for well anything we can offer and possibly a few things we cant.

3388233,0,t3_2wpmnq,you know I could be practical or I could be awesome.I pick one of two paths.Fist the wrekshit path. Power as my choice Imp master. She makes me a giant balrogesque bullshit thing and I become a master commander. With my insane power and skill I should be able to fight most normal challenges that come my way so the poor conditions wont matter much. I will brave the lake a bunch of times its one of the easiest tasks and relatively fast. I might eventually try to orchestrate the murder of a demon but it will be tough. My biggest plan is to rally other weaker beings of hell and souls using my power ability to make a veritable army of the damned. The imp will probably eventually end up liking me which is nice.second idea is the smart fucker path. I pick resources and newlypromoted demon  influence. simple bedroom walls floor water bathroom food kitchen and most importantly Demonic Library. Overall  points used. Now use the library and the resources intelligence boost to figure out how to get shit done indirectly or how to corrupt angels and such. Basically fight smart.Now I bet you are all wondering why I picked just those two and the answer is because they are the only two who can reach the  trust making them the only two I would really trust.,makeyourchoice,cpehhp3,1,t5_2w8em

Maybe in the middle of the damned Sahara boarding the Mediterranean. This is now my Sanctuary.nd use my Giver of Life to make everything within it full of life water and animals. The point is to be very big and showy.rd using the Internet and the media crews that inevitably show up I use my Master Orator powers to convince people to move to my new land and declare my Godhood. Ball is RollingThis should be enough to get people to move and start worshiping me. Once I start racking up the points I get in basically this order...Godly Mind and Divine Memory . Required to manage my utopia and for what comes next.Creator . Further cements my ability as a God.Immortality . So I can move outside my sanctuary without fear of getting killed by someone.Divine Guardian MAYBE Ancient Mysteries Expertise and Artistic in everything under the sun. Even at  leftover points with no perks from Ancient mysteries thats  subjects I now have complete mastery over. Also assuming I can get points from Ancient Mysteries I get Double Trouble so I can help myself manage my government.With my new influence my scientists create breakthroughs at absurd rates my artists overwhelm the world with music song TV shows movies and books. Even if there arent any geniuses flooding to my country I can set up the worlds greatest university as I can teach any subject in an  the normal time frame. This further cements my divine nature as inevitably some or all of these advancements glorify or are attributed to me. These also have synergistic effects on me. The more my scientists and artists advance their fields and create new discoveries the more I know retain and teach due to Divine Memory.End GameI use my orator powers to establish a unified world government convince the people of those nations who refuse to accept this new government to rise up and join anyways. I basically win the Civilization Science and Culture victory. At the same time.Other DemigodsLooking at the powers my idea is that given enough humans you can kill basically any demigod. Especially once my tech starts advancing and I can create tanks and missiles out of nothing.But I wont kill most of them. They are useful and hopefully most of them wont care about ruling or are willing to serve under me. There are people who would give me problems though.Crazy and Crazy strong Devourer. I take awhile to ramp up. If a Devourer decides he doesnt care about killing nations worth of humans then there isnt anything I can do about it other then appeal to other more combat oriented demigods.Shapeshifter. This one is scary. POTENTIALLY I could get couped by one of these and imprisoned while they take my place. Pretty much the reason I would get Divine Guardian because they would be able to spring medefend me.Eldritch Horror. I kill these. Somehow. They are dangerous and anyone who chose this isnt going to want to play nice.War God. Same reason as Eldritch Horror.

They will be told to keep quiet about who they pray to. DT will allow me to do this faster and DIM will allow me to remember who my followers are. I will need at least  Max  for the next step.Phase With my  points I will get Defender of the InnocentDEF DevourerDVRThis based on the key point that DT creates a perfect twin of myself. A demigod in its own right.Depending on how DEF interprets unbefitting of a paladin I will kill my twin and eat my heart. With REG I will not feel the physical pain of my own death phew. With this it is possible to generate pts from DEF and pts from DVR. I will buy another twin with the points I get with DEF. If DEF causes me to lose bonuses doing this I still get my pts for DVR and my twin is already dead I dont lose pointspowers until I complete the act. So I can at the very least net x pts from this.Phase Hoping I dont go insane I can still get pts from POA and at least pts from Phase.I will use the pts from POA to get Eldritch AbominationABOM Ancient MysteriesMYS Sixth SenseSIX Shape ShifterSFT Divine GuardianGRDI will use the pts from Phase to get Divine SpeedSPD Double TroubleDT Gods EyesEYE Master OratorORTWhen I go after other Demigods I will always SFT into someone else. DT ABOMs with SPD EYE SIX should be good in dealing with most demigods. Using MYS I will try to find just one cube to use as bait for others then eat their heart edit I would have GRD set the trap because they are harder to detect by other Demigods. With the POA if mortals stop worshiping you clause I believe it will allow me to keep ptspowers already earned even with just a handful of worshipers left. If I can just keep a few followers scattered. If the need arises I can quickly wipe their memories erasing DVRDEFABOMMYSSFT and GRD from my abilities so others wont know it was me eating all the hearts. If I need to though I think I can still get more followers after the reset. I still have REG POA TEL DT DIM SPD EYE ORT. If anyone hadnt already SFT into the President use TEL with ORT to have any Demigods rounded up so I can nom on their hearts.In reality Id see the chaos this would cause and try to build around trying to evacuate as many humans as I could from earth and rebuild in several other galaxies.

5383723,0,t1_cvyxg0x,You sure? the Voice asked.What are Orcs to someone as powerful as me? I boasted. I knew of course I might end up regretting those words but whatever I was cocky.Bright light enveloped my eyes before I found myself standing in a clear open field reminiscent of New Zealand. Pedro stood beside me.  Orcs riding Wargs charged at us. I scoffed and unleashed my fury.I quickly threw out Lugia amp Articuno to cover me from the air. I then proceeded to twist my hands about fancifully issuing silent killing curse after silent killing curse. One by one the Orcs fell and so did their Wargs. One Orc did close in on me. Deciding to show off I jumped onto Pedros head then bounced off and took my newly acquired sword slinging it right across the Orcs neck. His head came clean off and rolled on the ground. However the Warg was now charging Pedro who was trying to run away. I looked up at Lugia and one Aeroblast later the Warg ceased to exist.Hows that for a drawback! I shouted triumphantly raising my sword in the air. Ive got to remember to take more drawbacks like this one!So Pedro began.So what? I asked.Well theres two problems. First how do we get to the Shire much less find the Shire?Fuck I hadnt thought of that I replied dumbfounded. My horse was nowhere in sight. It must be at my home in the Shire. If I knew where it was I could have apparated there but I needed a map or something. I could have been in Mordor for all I knew. Whats the other problem?That guy over there Pedro said pointing to a very tiny man with big feet. He wasnt a man he was a Hobbit. A passed out one one who had seen things far too incredible and scary.Are you alright? I asked extending my hand to help him up.Oh quite alright he replied. Just a bit of a scare thats all. Is never seen anthin like that. You were incredible. You wouldnt hapen to ave some food miss?Would you happen to know your way back to The Shire? I asked raising my eyebrows.Well of course! The Hobbit piped up. Only bout a days walk.If you will be our guide then my friend Pedro will cook you anything you like. Deal? And about what you saw you must keep it a secret alright?I will guide you miss but if you would be having your secret kept Id be needing some payment he smiled devilishly.Ill put on a fireworks show for the whole village.The Hobbit contemplated my offer in silence. Tapping his foot index finger to his chin he began to hum.Youve got a deal miss! he said clasping my hand with his and shaking it. Off we go best be heading out while its still mornin. A loud growl echoed from the poor Hobbits stomach. I could really use my prebreakfast snack though Im right hungry I am. By the way ImMy time spent in Middle Earth was a simple existence. I lived in the Shire and hung out with the Hobbits. I knew of the events that would come but I let them pass. If I should alter them I may mess up the destruction of the Ring. I did however protect the Shire. None of the forces of evil would penetrate the Shire as long as I lived there. Best part about living in Middle Earth? Finding out that a watermelon is apparently sufficient when thrown just right to behead an Orc. Of all deaths it is truly the most hilarious death.Ready to go Pedro? I asked looking over at him. He nodded in approval. Somehow we had survived in Middle Earth. We had had a mostly peaceful existence except for those couple times I decided to join an Orc hunting party. Oh and that time me and Sam spiked a fountain to foam over the hobbit in charge was not pleased. He might have beat us to death if he had caught us.Next jump here I come! I shouted from the mountaintop taking in one last good look of Middle Earth. Ten years here. I was now  at least in this world. Older than I had ever been. And considering all the years lived in the other jumps all the lives and personalities I had absorbed I started to feel old. Perhaps my time of adventure was nearing its end. Or and it was entirely possible I was beginning to have a midlife crisis. But nonetheless I felt the bright light surround me the faces of all my Hobbit friends swimming before my eyes and soon I was making my choices for the new world I was about to enter.Previous NarrativesPokemon  Cosmic WarehouseBody Mod  Harry Potter  Mystery Dungeon  Ranma   ,makeyourchoice,cvztxmp,1,t5_2w8em

Never to busy to help her fellows never to tired to watch the kids for a bit out around town. I loved her my father loved er and the town loved her.She was the towns witch. Called upon doing the usual tasks of healing the sick warding the house in the wake of a new childs arrival into the world calming the spirits and attempt to keep the crops alive in the wake of plague and famines. She was powerful yes but she wasnt the best at her craft. Having to spend more time than normal on spells and incantation because she was so unsure of her self. What Im trying to get at is that even though she was a witch we still loved her and she was always there for us. Her death was hard on the remnants of the town. Those of The Magis Order decided that this poor witch in this small little town was worth their time to get ride of. For what ever reason they wish to keep to keep the use of magic in order. So to keep it in order in the small town we lived in they tried their hardest to try to get rid of the town. They burned the fields and drove all of the inhabitants away. Me and my father escaped we tried to save our mother but it was she who they were after and so sacrificed herself to save us. They stopped their attack after killing her. Seeing that attacking those without magic was the equivalent to killing another man in their eyes.The event stuck with me for a long time. And the growth of The Magis Order didnt stop and it began to be viewed as a savior to those without magic. I knew the truth and I knew their true face. So I decided to be the thorn in their side. I went to find the ores and metal myself to create my sword and shield. Finding the man to forge them was hard especially since it was considered illegal to use said ore without The Magis Orders permission. But it was done my tools to harm them had been complete and I began to use them against them.I also use magic as I inherited it from my mother. However it seems as though my specialty in the magical fields seems to be summonings and conjurations. I had to supplement this deficiency through my weapons. My Sword is imbueds with powers to keep me going for longer than their armies. It is also imbued with a magical trap that I use to keep those generals alive. I need to ask questions dont I?My shield is imbued with more defensive magics. The need to protect myself is quite handy for when the fatigue eventually sets in. Especially considering my style in the blade combat doesnt use a shield at all. Since I can summon demons and beast of the other worlds to help me in combat I must rely on myself to protect myself.My blade and my shield are my tools. My tools to keep what happened to my mother from happening to others.,makeyourchoice,cyvyd0i,6,t5_2w8em

Plus I love the cold and having my stronghold on a snowy mountainside with taiga surrounding it sounds lovelyThe Castle has a good balance of Defences and Rooms both of which I valued over Powers since I can use the rooms to train in magic fighting and smithing over the billions of years Ill be living there. The Vault is to ensure the maximum protection possible for the Heart and The Showroom allows me to have my own troops to help defend the stronghold or go out with me on expeditions into the cold.As well as the cold climate the Towers and Drawbridge should be more than enough to deal with the smaller weaker Abyss. The Cannons and Towers can kill or at the very least weaken the stronger forms of Abyss. If anything gets in I have a legion of Animations and troops to fight alongside me and Blockades to funnel them into chokepoints keeping them away from The Heart.The Aura helps in general with slower invasions and less of them.

8265673,0,t3_4sl2rc,Well this is an interesting one. Possibly NSFW Marked as such on mobile so I didnt notice. I guess Im going to kick us off! Im going to go with Mind War to try to make it a mindcontrol themed House of Cardsstyle drama. That gives me  Control Points and  Rivals. Average Joe will give me  Character Points I want this to be the story of a creative clever but ultimately regular guy who goes toetotoe with Machiavellian manipulators. Upon further consideration I think Big Damn Me for  Character Points would be more fun as this seems like a highoctane largerthanlife world and I want to fit in. And on that note Im going to go for Reincarnation  and become a halfElf looking basically human but immortal and with regenerative abilities. It never said there were limits!.My skills Mental Elasticity  points I want to be able to recover from any subtle traces left on me and avoid being a sleeper agent. Iron Will  points should help me get out of any dangerous scenarios or push through pain to accomplish my plans or activate my contingencies. Skill  point Im choosing Antimemetic Training if youre familiar with the SCP Foundation. Basically this is all about thinking laterally noticing subtle details that dont add up being able to find holes in your memory deducing undue influence etc. Skill  point ObservationAnalysis basically turns me into Sherlock. This should synergise immensely with Antimemetic Training plus itll give me a leg up on understanding control methods and spotting sleeper agents. Skill  point Planning again will synergise well and allow me to orchestrate Machiavellian manipulations.As to the universe Im going with FarFlung Future and Mystical Mysteries. I want to experience it all and this sounds like a ton of fun. Im then going with Twinge of Telepathy and Superhuman Start for just a bit of flavourthe rationale being that its a rare psychic who can read other aliens minds and most alien interbreeding doesnt workbut if it does voila superpowers! Furries... I dont know man. I want Chewbacca and such and humanoidanimalistic aliens would be cool...just use your imagination I suppose. Medium tone to allow for interesting compelling storylines without being depressing or ending too sadly.My Controls Pheromones Level   point to make me a subtle version of Kilgrave but also to help me talk my way into or out of anything. Should boost my natural gift of gab. Psionicsgt Compulsion Level   points to make people sleeper agents and double agents. The extra time and complexity will be invaluable.gt Memory Weaving  point was I ever there? With this wiping all traces of my existence or plots will be easy. Plus itll make it far easier to turn my enemies against each other. Pressure Points  points going for quantity over quality here in combat this will be invaluable and now just a quick handshake is all itll take to disable someone. Should go well with my pheromones.My RivalsStage Hypnotist She seems lighthearted but could get interesting imagine her turning all her devoted fans after me in a giant manhunt. That would be a great climax to an arc. Showy flamboyant probably petty and petulant toonot too cruel or scary but a bit of fridge horror in there. Shed be a great first arc villain.Mad Scientist Would be a great secondseason villain. A bit darker sure but more morally complex and interesting. Shed be clever enough to have plans and contingencies Im sure so Id have to prep and outplan her while fending off her minions.Siren I dont know if the Siren would be a better secondarc villain or third but either way it would be cool to have a slightly paranoidmanipulative arc. Nothing like trying to identify and root out sleeper agents.Bonus Points! Ill use one to turn a rival into an ally Kitsune sounds like a fun person to hang out with and Im sure that her abilities will come in useful. I considered turning the Genie into an ally but rejected it for the same reason I rejected the technology reality warper and magic  its just too OP. Another point will go towards Chronological Order so I can take the rivals one at a time. The last point goes towards two additional traits Superb Athlete and Resistance Magic. This should keep me from being instareality warped away and let me use my Pressure Points in combat.,makeyourchoice,d5arm3p,3,t5_2w8em

Tentacles  in my head these are like vines or flexible branches he can useScales  hes a tree so Im kind of paying for his Bark exterior to be as tough as you would expectUnnoticed  this is to pay for him being able to presumably blend into a forest and not stick out at all.Then I think I have  remaining points which I would put into Magic. Magic is kind of hard to quantify because there arent Human levels to compare to but I figure a level of  is pretty solid.Hidden Mystery questFinal Stats Str Toughness Agility  hes a pretty rooted guyMagic I like it in my headcanon. Hes a familiar but you know he mostly hangs out in the forest as a tree would using his magic as he likes to benefit the environment  heal wounded critters. Hes much smarter than me so I come to him for advice on things or just to chat or if I need help with something in particular. That being said he doesnt ever remember his or my name. But this is fine we laugh about it. I figure in nature nothing really has names so this is a concept hes not great at. We share pain but its almost a benefit. Im not doing much of anything to get myself wounded hes really not doing much of anything and can probably protect himself from everyday troubles.

8700622,0,t3_4z66pf,Reason Justice A world of war is not a world we should be forced to live in and so I set out to change it.Traits Charisma Here Be Dragons Fire Living Armor The most important thing to a leader is his peoples faith in them and my natural charisma will earn me that. The next most important thing to a leader is someone he can rely on to get him through the tough times and my dragon will be there for that. The last most important thing to a leader is assurance that he can live to see his quest through and my living armor shall do that for me.Troops  sets of Dragonborn  set of HalfElves  set of Dwarves and  set of Undead My dragonborn will be front line tanks so it is important to have many of them. My halfelves will mostly be archers though they will take up melee combat to fight any who break through the front line. My dwarves will serve as saboteurs avoiding direct combat while undermining literally the opponent and bypassing their defenses. My undead will simply serve to give me more troops while providing some combat support.Army Traits Lesser Magic Terror Finest Steel Scimitar Sex Appeal Magic will be very helpful to an army so I took that. Morale is very important to an army so I took terror to reduce the enemys. Weapons are important so I made sure everybody had one. Any way to debilitate the enemy will help so I took sex appeal for that.First Conquest Grimmora These people are the greatest threat to peace by far. My strategy against them would be very simple with all my dragonborn tanking at the front line while my halfelves rain death from the sky. My dwarves will keep the orcs from getting footing and the undead will keep my numbers high.Second Conquest Vrxxnyr These people are less dangerous to peace than the orcs but will most likely still prove troublesome.  Since the imps can fly my strategy will have to change. I will have most of my dragonborn form a ring around my army with concentration increasing towards the goblins and about  of them will be interspersed throughout my army. The halfelves dwarves and undead will do their usual job but this time the dwarves and undead will be more spread throughout the army instead of heading towards the enemy.Third Conquest Regalia These nobles who send others to die for them are exactly the kind I despise. Instead of a headon fight here I will instead try to turn the people to my side and start an uprising against the nobles. If I must though Ill employ tactics similar to the one I used at Vrxxnyr but with more of an arch shape with all of my dragonborn instead of a portion of them and my dwarves and undead will once again focus on moving towards the enemy.Fourth Conquest Castelia This king is not very open to negotiation but I hope that I may use my natural charisma to get him to allow me to rule in his stead. If that fails then I will have my dwarves burrow under the wall and open the gates allowing my troops to enter and storm the city.Fifth Conquest Naturelle These people are reclusive so I would be willing to let them be but elitism only causes tension. I will fly my dragon above the forest to help plot a path. If I cannot find one my fire mages dragon born and my dragon will burn the forest down and take the city in the insuing chaos. The forests ashes will be used as fertilizer for farmland and the remaining trees will become protected and actively grown. The elves children will be educated to believe that they are equal to to other races.Sixth Conquest Nirzumbil I do not have much problem with these people and so I will request of their king to remove the traps and in its stead have a portion of my army protect them. If they refuse so be it there will always be room underground for them to live and they do not seem to be conquest inclined people.Seventh Conquest Dormenia Im not going to try to conquer them Im only going to ask that they keep their wanderings off of protected land and I will protect that land if they refuse.As for what I do afterwards I will remain the leader of my army conquering all who challenge this era of peace and I will appoint those I trust most as the leaders of this world.,makeyourchoice,d6t7kh7,3,t5_2w8em

I dont give two shits about wether you believe me. This is reddit this is the internet and unless you are informed well enough in psychology I seriously doubt you would even understand their relevance. Say I cited a study in high level mathematics fuck for that sake algebra the average person wouldnt understand it. My citations arent relevant unless they would come from a book that would explain it. In fact even when I talk with people who know that my  year degree was going to be psych they STILL argue with me about what IQ means. Your first comment shows me that you dont even know what IQ is measuring. Without going out of your way to read a shit ton of it citations wouldnt matter in the first place. It goes so far as to be comical can you even answer the following questions What does IQ measure? How do we measure it? How do we know if it works efficiently if it doesnt predict the likelihood of success? Does the mathematics function like degrees and does it measure high or low intelligence with accuracy and precision. Both one or neither?Oh and I never claimed to be a genius as IQ tests are rarely indicators of genius. You can actually practice IQ tests until you can max any given IQ test. You can literally take a shit load of them research questions and the mathematics which would pertain to the particular IQ test you chose and pass with a much higher score.

All you need is the right lookup table.For instance you could send back a number representing which stock will go up the most tomorrow which would get you rich fairly quickly.You could even have different types of messages in a single transmission by reserving part of your code space for other things.  For instance If the first binary digit is a  Im not sending a stock tip Im sending a warning.Or you could just take the nonminor power and then you can write it in plain English but wheres the fun in that?Transmutation is a close second  not as flexible but conjuring a kilo of gold is probably an easier way to make money than playing the stock market.  Plus you could do clever artsy things like make something out of origami and then turn it into gold.At the minor level however its no great shakes  all I can think of is creative ways to destroy things by turning bits of it into gas or energy.Pinhole portals seems too small to be exploitable without the major power  even wires are often bigger than  mm.  The best I can think of is to make a pinhole camera out of it and use it to spy on people.Telekinesis I dont know enough math to work out how much force that pressure translates into.

11061465,0,t3_5xrg70,ltUndertale BSG gtDr McNinja point cost point totalOrigin Radical Landsman  Ill be perfectly honest Im not particularly fond of any of the origins but Im not picking ninja dealing with stuff like the Inverse ninja law in a universe where Memetics and RuleOfCool are things that actually exist so Radical lands it is.Age  Locations Underground Caves  Picked by the originPerksComic Book Science  A getoutofdeath free card and possibly the best thing about this jump. With Determination from Undetale I now have  free deaths in each jump.Radical Landsman   Free proficiency for extreme sports so whatever.Perfectly Legitimate Businessman  I can basically make and refind gold ex nihilo with my warehouse MatterForge and now I get a perk that lets me liquidize that potential and play corporate games without any problems? Hell yes.ItemsDirtbike  Its free and Im going to upgrade that dirtbike with all the tech I and magic I have until its easily an exterminatus grade weapon in its own right between PowerRingMaltusian technology and Maker magitech that is a totally realistic goal for a dirtbike.True Dew  Power Ring scan followed by chemical synthesis should be possible but I dont really care so much about the Dew beyond its uniqueness to the DrMcNverse.OverviewIm going to leverage my perfectly legitimate business acument to have fun running a corporation and trying to uplift humanity basically be the Elon Musk of this world. I can survive pretty much anything the Dr McNinja verse has to throw at me and If I burn both of my plotarmor ressurections then Ill just leave the planet and spend the rest of the jump mining other planets in the Milky Way and practicing my various combat skills so as not to die in later jumps.,makeyourchoice,delsrzu,2,t5_2w8em
11316803,0,t1_dfehppi,The description of traveller seems to imply you can only bring back memories to reality so if you care about having an impact on Earth it certainly cant replicate the effects of many other choices though you could keep all the knowledge you got from orange pill style powers.                                   Also I think youre missing how plans such as getting GAI could be sped up even getting FAI a single day earlier corresponds to over a hundred thousand lives saved by having a billion dollars worth of seed money moneys just really useful especially if you can throw as much as needed at a problem.,makeyourchoice,dfeqp0g,5,t5_2w8em

11648821,0,t3_65qdf2,I know your intent is to NOT have exploits giving all the powers... but I really want to take Morph and then morph myself into a younger form. Or take Disease and create pathogens that kill cancer boost the immune system improve heart health treat dementia and so on ultimately granting immortality. Or use Ethereal or Elemental Form to obtain a body that simply cannot age because its not organic tissue. Ok so clearly youll nerfdisallow these for balancing reasons but that brings me to another point. So many of these arent worth it especially when their effectiveness mind control memory really wants x boosts or the ability punishes you hard for using it healing reset. Youve got like  abilities here and everyones choosing only  or  and ignoring well over half. ,makeyourchoice,dggep2e,1,t5_2w8em

11751629,0,t1_dgs2lt3,I am but a plaything of the gods and they seek to thrust me into every adventure they can. For ten years I will never know a day of rest or an easy journey. Does this bother me? Not really. For I know the truth about the gods they are not but parasites that require the faith of mortals. They should not be worshiped but pitied instead.  Hmm. Maybe things like that are why gods dont like me much. ,makeyourchoice,dgs2rpz,1,t5_2w8em
