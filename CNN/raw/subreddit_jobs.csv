Nobody should have to put up with that kind of abuse and I applaud your wife for keeping her cool. The boss doesnt sound like the kind of person who is level headed or approachable. Not only is he abusive to his employees but he is abusing the only position of authority in a small company. While he has plans to expand the company his personality and explosive behavior may be the downfall of his company. It sounds like he just hasnt ran into the right person.Also if she and the other employees are demure and accommodating to his outbursts he will keep doing it. I would say they need to stand up to him however I would hate to see them lose their job for insubordination or target them for more abuse. Your wife should really try to contact a workplace counselorsomeone in HR that could advise her.Definitely dont quit. If she leaves on good terms now she will have the option to return to the company later. Just come up with a good excuse. Dont tell anyone she is leaving and tell the boss she was approached by a different company but keep in contact.

I think illustration is an incredibly hard industry to get into and it would be difficult to make a living off of it. However its not strictly IMPOSSIBLE. You should try to connect with other illustrators who are in positions that you would like to be in and talk to them about how they got where they are.

I get the travel all around my county every day.I work outside.I get free van so I dont pay for my own travel.I meet new people every day.Theres a new problem to solve on every property I visit.Sometimes if theres only a small job or I work fast I get an hour or more free to relax before the next one. BadI get paid minimum wage.Its an extremely labor intensive job so Im always tired.Theres no promotion ladder or career opportunities.I get very lonely and bored as Im usually working alone and the job doesnt interest me at all.The weather is usually terrible here so Im always in the rain.Im usually freezing cold outside or overheating in the loft.The noise of the drill I use is making me deaf.The van is  years old slow noisy uncomfortable and constantly has issues running.I have degree and Im qualified to be earning as much as  times my current wage.Everyone thinks Im stupid or simple for having a manual Labour based job. I drill holes in walls doesnt impress anyone.I get no overtime incentive and every job is paid little no matter how far I travel or how hard the job is.I have no social connection with the people that work in the office which alienates me.The work although varying in situation is very monotonous in practise.I get no thanks and most clients dont even want me there.The long drives are one of the things that has prompted me to start smoking.I am covered in spiderwebs dust concrete and mud at the end of every day.The surveyors I work with earn  times what I do per job and they only show their face for  minutes and do the same paperwork I have to do anyway.Sometimes a property has no electricity so I need to use the generator which then saturates my entire van in fumes including any food in lunchbox I was planning to eat.Every day I spend here I am one day closer to dying without reaching my dream.The uglySometimes I visit the properties of HOARDERS I cant move here which makes my job difficult but worse is that these people have serious mental issues and its very depressing to see them in the condition theyre in. I often visit properties that belonged to someone who is now deceased. Sometimes I see their things lying around or bloodstains or General neglect and it breaks my heart to see the elderly dying in lonely dirty houses.

Just say you worked with a couple of small comps helping them out relate it to your field and while doing that you studied udemy courses. Make shit up. Also get your friends to act like a previous employer if they can pull it off. Basically what i have learned is no one gives a shit and its a cut throat game out there. The only way you can get ahead is play the game and by that i mean rig it cheat at it have no mercy. Have no ethical boundaries because in essence your fighting to live another day just to pay your bills. My opinion might sound harsh but if you ask yourself what will happen in  years from now? Will i ever be with the same company? Maybe but maybe not. Automation is on its way to kill jobs and when that happens more and more people will compete in less fields for shittier pay cause greed powers our corps and governments these days.

The problem is that in your scenario it assumes that no business will ever hire more people to compensate for a greater increase in demand. The only other option would be to raise the price of your goods to apply to the new said demand but companies that only employ raising prices will lose out to those that employ creating a better supply to compensate for the new demand.

Even at these levels it wouldnt affect prices greatly as it seems to be a common assertion that it would affect prices greatly.Of course it could be harmful if pushed too high but theres no suggestion that  would destroy economies with the current data available.If you would like a different slippery slope in the other direction then one would ask why not just legalize slavery? You wouldnt consider this a fair question if someone off hand wanted to lower the minimum wage.,jobs,ch873n6,-3,t5_2qhnd

From what Ive heard from my graphic designer friend you could profit from some more technical skills in that area e.g. how to make and design websites. If you want to do that look into HTML CSS JavaScript and so on. There are loads of online materials to teach you these things for free. If you have done that start building a portfolio. Make mock websites do photoshop projects whatever. Just so that when you apply for a job you can not only say Yeah I totally know how to do that you can just pull up your portfolio website and demonstrate.Edit One last thing consider that such a career may often be freelancebased which can result in dry periods followed by being overwhelmed by work. This might not be for everyone. There are also to jobs in graphic design of course however it seems these are more difficult to come by.

I started working for the company I work for now as a parttimer and was going to college for music.  Business started to take off about  months after I started and it was clear that there were boom times ahead so I decided to quit college and work fulltime.  It quickly became clear to me that I had no interest in doing the actual work being done but I made a name for myself after our consultant that handled our database solution absolutely overpromised and underdelivered on a key project.  I straight up learned the program took over his role and havent looked back since.  I dont want to go into too many specifics as I know there are other people that I work withhave worked with in the past that browse Reddit.Its kind of hard to accurately asses what your value to the company is because there are a TON of factors that come into play but my employer was right about your size ish at the peak and the sum you mention k seems about onpar with what Id expect to see for somebody whose roll is clearly extremely important to the company.One thing to realize is that in business you need to look out for  first.  If that company all of a sudden went bellyup as a result of the owners divorce do you think he would even bat an eye if he had to lay you off?Edit  Also you pretty clearly outline the savings youve brought to that company k k plus the savings of two FTEs salaries that are now performed by one FTE plus other projects so I say start there when asking for a raise.tldr Youre clearly undervaluing yourself.,jobs,ci2jgg6,3,t5_2qhnd

If you believe that your current company is going to make it in the future obviously you are in a good place keep working hard play an integral part in getting there. If this is not the case I would strongly suggest going to the bigger international company. Ive work hard for past  years at a mom and pop companystartup. Ive made a lot of decisions and played a big part as an employee in the company but things didnt work out for the company as intended and they started the shut down process. Ive spent good couple of weeks being depressed and lost but finally snapped out of it and started to search for jobs. Ive gotten some interviews and companies that I want to work for but none of them hired and a lot of them wont even interview me because my experience though looks good and sounds good doesnt hold the same value as experiences from a big company. It is truly sad and I feel lost... I know something will come up Ill have to lower my bar a little bit and try to get in with a more entry level position so the risk is lower for the employer to hire me. As a comparison my older brother who worked for the same company left a year ago and got a job at a multibillion dollar international corporation he was overqualified for the position imo he worked there for a year beefed up his resume under the big companies name and got interviews from pretty much all the companies he applied to and got an offer from one of the companies that I was trying to get an interview from I didnt get the interview. I was shocked and couldnt believe the difference that one year at a big company made. The bigger company may have less responsibility right now and you probably will have to get used to some bs corp ladder and office politics but if you can be in a good relationship with the team upper management and go above and beyond theres a chance you will be able to move up in a year. If not they can be on your resume and you can go to a company that you really believe in and want to work for. ,jobs,ci4jtnn,3,t5_2qhnd

1452122,0,t3_2as7rs,Many writers and other creative types simply make it by with dayjobs while harnessing their craft. You just may be one of those people.. I have a rather successful painter friend who did exactly this. Essentially what you need from a job in this case is twofold. First it needs to be something that you can forget when you clock out.. no weekend projects no lingering stress of a todo list just Goodbye. This will free your mind to be creative and not get you into that career mentality. Also youll need something that is relatively highpay for shorter hours. Generally gratuity based service jobs work well for this. Think waiter bartender valet hairdresser etc. These generally allow you a bit more free time to work on your writing while still getting SOME money in the bank to live on. However there will certainly be a trade off and if you find yourself seriously writing and honing your craft then by all means go for it. But I know many artists who are more interested in drinkingdrugs in their freetime and claim that they just need more time to work on their art. This is really terrible but allows them that psychological satisfaction to feel like theyre working on something ... even if its just an excuse to get fucked up. You mentioned having a degree did you finish? If so there are lots of reasonable  jobs that will take you on... more than likely it will be administrative but certainly pay well enough to support yourself modestly... and if you really just want bottom barrel and arent interested in climbing the latter you can effectively showup do some mindless work and go home and do what you love. TLDR  get a service industry job with tips. Make sure youre actually writing instead of psychologically satisfying yourself with that idea and just sitting around getting drunk instead. ,jobs,ciyarjs,5,t5_2qhnd

Go to start up events. Check out coworking spaces in your area. Offer any skills you may have for free many start ups at the early stage are boot strapping and arent easy.Let me make one thing clear. Being in a start up is hard. It is very hard. Many people like the idea of working at a start up. Yeah I can make my own path. Be part of a successful company. Make a ton of money. It is a lot of work. This isnt a normal  hour a week job. You often work anywhere from  hours a week with  maybe  days off a week if youre lucky. You often wont take any sort of vacation minus maybe a day or two off for Christmas for years. Often you arent paid hell you can barely pay your server costs. You are constantly rejected by funders and potential customers. You have to often wear  different hats I do recruiting accounting customer service QA testing financial projections and anything else that gets thrown at me. Your company will most likely fail.I say it because there are a lot things out their that romanticize the start up world. You have to be willing to work quickly and dedicate years to something that may not succeed. I wouldnt change my experience for the world. I have weird skills that no one else my age knows. I know everything required to build a company from the ground up. I have met with people a variety of high profile people in my industry but it is a lot of work.

1866417,0,t3_2fyii3,I think the trades can be a good option to find work but it all depends on opportunity. If you find a Union job then youll be making good money but those are very competitive and hard to come by if you dont have the connections. One of my best friends is a Mason Tenders Apprentice in a union and started around hr at . Not too sure on Union politics and all but its a pretty sound job depending on the trade. I work nonunion and the pays can be good but not ridiculously great like the oil and welding jobs most of reddit raves about. What I see with Non Union work typically is somewhere around  for unskilled labor and around  for skilled labor. Remember it all depends on location as well when it comes to job availability and pay. Here in NYC theres a surge is available work so its slightly easier to get your foot in I think. If your the type of person who doesnt mind getting dirty  coming home with a sore back and can brave the weather than Id definitely recommend the trades to you. Theres always opportunities to progress if you work your ass off in my opinion. ,jobs,cke3iqr,1,t5_2qhnd

1992616,0,t1_ckt9kl5,Ive had friends from college get jobs with an economics degree without internship experience and not necessarily great grades.  Opportunities do increase for better gradessome kind of internship but they are not completely necessary that is the point.I will restate what I have said about unpaid internships.  Research has shown multiple times please feel free to google or look at articles  when comparing a candidate that has had unpaid internship experience vs no internship experience at all candidates with no internship experience at all had a higher rate of offers.  This is not meant to show that not taking an unpaid internship is more beneficial than taking one but credential wise it has little effect on the outcome of your future candidacy considering it is volunteering rather than being hired to do productive work.When looking for candidates and a variety of candidates are chosen to interview some have a subjectively better resume or experience than the other.  However it all comes down to the interview.  Experience and credentials will never make up for low performers and poor interpersonal skills both of which can be gauged in the interview process.  Thus whatever step you are being stuck on whether its the application process or the interview process feedback of getting it or not getting it should tell you where you need to adjust your strategy.The job hunting process is common for all people because there is a common goal and that is to land offers.  The variables that may increase or decrease their difficulties are always present as they should be in a complex system.  One of the variables could be having bad grades and another variable being that you need good grades for this industry. Being knowledgeable and leveraging your complete understanding of the game helps you formulate better strategies to deal with these challenging variables.  This is a competitive mindset.  With great grades internship experience and institution some people are fortunate some people are not and unfortunately their disappointment generally comes from a sense of entitlement.  A lot of people will sit down and blame the economy their degree how annoying the job hunt process is complain complain complain because they feel a sense of entitlement for having strong credentials entering the job search game.  But in the end the game does not care about how emotional you get about the job search how much you want to convince yourself that your one method is the best method to get a job or what you feel the game should be.  Even with the most difficult situations the most competitive and adaptive minds will formulate a strategy to beat the odds.My post is to help OP understand that the best way to approach such a complex problem is to resolve it with an empirical approach coupled with factual research data about unpaid internships.  Giving him straight up advice on what he needs to study and how hard he shouldve worked in school does very little in the big picture and cannot be realistically be applied to every scenario he runs into.  Ultimately he will figure out what direction he wants to take and spend time to understand what motivates him.,jobs,cktb6vs,0,t5_2qhnd

2043328,0,t1_ckytov5,Well obviously its open for debate. Im sure a good argument can be made for either side. From my perspective and economic beliefs thoughIt would lead to less graduates. Hopefully it would lead to more people gaining either technical skills through a shorter cheaper program or by simply entering the workforce at  instead of . Instead of spending money for a degree for  years and then working as an just an example and not the best one auto mechanic. Instead these people could enter the workforce at  at an automechanic and gain skills that will be more applicable to their future while actually being paid. The simple fact is that there are more people with degrees than jobs that require degrees. Weve made higher education into a right or necessity when in reality the OPPORTUNITY should be a right and nothing more. Also hopefully and this is highly contested and variable by removing less people from the education pool and thus less people requiring loans higher education would become less expensive. If you were to look at a simple supply and demand graph the influx of people going to college and getting loans making it easier to go to college is a supply side shifter. This shift causes the product education to become more expensive. gtCorrect me if Im wrong but wont all this policy do is lead to a greater number of science graduates?I say no because universities still have a limited resources per college including space teachers equipment and books. It costs more to educate someone studying Biomedical Engineering that it does Philosophy b standards and prestige to uphold in these college to actually give their product value and c I had a c but I forgot.gtUnless you study a health course I believe there arent thousands of jobs in research opening every year.Agreed but there are more jobs available for science grads than arts grads for example. Additionally you probably gain skills in science or business that are more applicable to high paying jobs even if they are outside the specific field. Example Im a couple months from finish my accounting degree. While Im confident that I will be able to get a job in my field if I dont Im even more confident that I will be able to get a job outside the field that will pay well enough to pay off my absurd amount of loans.Lastly I also think its silly for Science just an example because you mentioned it students to take on loans that they wont be able to pay off. The real problems in my opinion are a the cost of education is through the roof. You could talk about causes for days but I think it boils into two previously mentioned buckets education is now a rightnecessity and the loans make it easier to go. b when it is time to make these decisions juniorsenior year of high school many students dont have the knowledge to really understand what theyre undertaking and the impact of where they go and the loansmoney it requires. Some kids do good for them or they have parents who have a good understanding and can help again good for them. I didnt have that and in retrospect if I had the knowledge I do now I would have attended a much less expensive school. I think Ill be okay but for a good chunk of time after I enter the workforce my lifestyle will likely not match that of many of my counterparts. I plan on living frugally almost like I do now for years in order to get my loans paid off ASAP. I still see colleagues that dont understand what a bitch interest is. I guess its just such a variable broad topic that its hard to really discuss unless you narrow it down or do so through a different more stuctured medium.This just turned into a giant blob of a rant. Sorry if its more than you bargained for and Im sure some is incoherent. Id be happy to clarify my thoughts if youd like though. For now I got some baseball to watch.,jobs,ckzjw1z,1,t5_2qhnd

2044299,0,t3_2i6cpl,I started as an apprentice pipefitter doing agricultural and industrial at  years old. Turned  graduated highschool and finished up my Journeymans card in North Dakota on the pipelines. Welded for two years as a pipeline welder and made a shitload of money but lived like a homeless person and never saw my family. So I decided for a change. And like space is cool right? What little kid doesnt want to be an astronaut at some phase? So I decided I wanted to work for NASA except Im no rocket scientist obviously. BUT I got a job at another company that is big in aerospacedefense training to be a machinist and I got to make parts that went to NASA. So sort of like working for NASA. Maybe later Ill follow it forward along the supply path and work for them. But machining is fun. Boss is great and Im learning stuff about roboticsautomation programming installation maintenance and repair. So Im a machinist but a doeverythingmachinist. And in December Im switching jobs again in an internal transfer to get my Journeymans card as an industrial mechanic. So beyond NASA I want to be a welderpipefittermachinistautomation techmechanic. And maybe also later become an electrician. Ive worked in eight states now and its been a strange and wonderful ride.My advice Never pay for school. If you really wanted college you would have made the effort for the grades or won the scholarships in another way. Passion and determination if you wanted to go to college then youd do it and do it for free. If you are not completely suited for academia and thrive on studying learning and books then dont go to college. Some College is just wasted time opportunity and debt and many people who attempt college end up in that boat. Then there are also hugely hindering student loans if scholarships and grades failed to make the cut. Why enslave yourself as a debtor? There are other ways to an education.  Lets talk abut those other ways. The skilled trades is my passion and hopefully I can impart that to some of you. And this is important because in trades training they PAY YOU TO LEARN. The greatest lie ever conceived is that you should pay someone else so that you can expend hours and years of work. All the information humanity has gained through hundreds of years of study are in books and available for free in libraries and the internet. They tell you that you owe them money to be qualified you have to spend your value able time and effort in classes that dont pertain to your intended career and its a giant scam. Why are you paying to work? Why is there a rise in unpaid internships? People are so gungho to pay money to spend time in their lives working for others. College is many things and I respect it but I think the costs and benefits need to be closely reexamined and the idea that everyone should go to college needs to die and be buried.  Apprenticeships as a means of learning and skill growth. In an apprenticeship you get paid an hourly wage and benefits like health insurance dental insurance k to learn. So youre in class? Youre getting paid by the hour to sit there and listen. Youre at the job site learning hands on and watching Journeymen mentors? Youre getting paid. The lie is that education has to cost us something. People are so happy to sign up for technical college or trade school which I might add are often for profit and predatory but dont apply for the learning opportunities that exist to pay them to learn. Why? Because it is instilled in our culture that learningcollegetuition.  Find an apprenticeship near you!

He sent me and probably a hundred others a short email explaining that he was currently looking and asked if I knew of any openings anywhere. I had actually JUST been contacted about a job that I turned down so I called them and forwarded his information to them. They called him within a day and he had a job within a week.So it does happen. I think the key here is that youre doing it.

2764691,0,t3_2rqd42,Hi there! I understand your anxiety but its going to be alright. The first place I would recommend that you look is for oncampus employment. If youre in the US determine if you are either A work study or Bstudent hire. This information should be available through your financial aid office. Once you have this information start applying to jobs on campus. This is a good idea because these types of positions will work around you classes and are in my experience very understanding of the demands of study. Also less commuting if youre already on campus!If this is not an option or is undesirable for some reason look for a job either in the fast foodservice industry. These are not glamorous positions but your lack of work experience will make it difficult for you to secure something higher unless you have substantial volunteeringacademic honors. I worked in fast food through all four years of my undergrad. It was shitty and often brutal but I could pay my bills met a lot of really great people and gained valuable work experience. Furthermore these types of places will not immediately disqualify you for lack of work experience. The interview is important imho. You need to present yourself as  reliable hard working and serious about the job. Its incredible how many people get these types of jobs and then blow it off thereby losing their position.

2836795,0,t1_cnqehkw,The differences I would forsee between community collegeuniversity as opposed to straight in the university.   It will obviously cost a lot less. At community college you can get  years worth of courses done for a lot less money than the same courses at the university. Just make sure they transfer! by checking transferequivalency guides and verifying with advisers from both schools. With technical credits its usually not a problem.  Community colleges have smaller classes which can be beneficial for getting to know your professors better. Which would mean they could know you on a more personal level for letters of recommendation and maybe even be able to help you get a job in your field. Your mileage will vary.   This is a disadvantage of starting at CC. Exceptional students at university are able to get great internships and research positions as early as their freshman year. Its not unheard of. It is rather unheard of for community colleges students to get internships nonetheless research unless its through a select CCcoop program or a personal connection family family friend. So sometimes kids who go the CC gt university route are outgunned by kids who have more experience due to their circumstances. And youll also find that most internships will want students who are currently enrolled in a year institution. Now you have a unique position due to your vast experience so I cant really tell you how this would play out.   If you plan on working while going to school or doing it part time youll probably find their classes offer a bit more flexibility. This may not always be true.  Say you do two years at a community college but then figure youre happy enough where you are professionally and the program wasnt really satisfying you. You can drop it and at least walk away with an associates degree which may or may not help you. If you drop a program at university then you dont get any sort of consolation prize.As for my point about the associates degree. If you look at a standard CSCompE associates the highest level class youll probably see is something like an intro to algorithms course.,jobs,cnqjgc4,2,t5_2qhnd

Youre applying for all the widget jobs with no success. The targeted strategy means you do some research first and identify all the companies that make widgets in your search area.  Eliminate those youre not interested in.First see if these places have any jobs posted.  Maybe they dont post where youve been looking.   If they have a search agent you can sign upfor that automatically notifies you of open roles sign up for it. Second you have to work your network.  LinkedIn FB Twitter IRL etc.  to see who you know who works there or if someone you know knows someone who works there.  Youre trying to get the inside track  a referral to interview.  This is where Informational Interviews come in along with a lot of research both of which make you a better candidate for any widget job regardless of where you find it.  Its about getting insight into what is sometimes called the hidden job market.   Its the idea that a majority of jobs arent posted at any given time because they are Only posted internally at the company In someones head but not on paper Havent actually been created yet but they could make a job just for you,jobs,cnrxb3t,1,t5_2qhnd

Its not like you are going to become undesirable to other employers in the amount of time it takes to see what the raise is.

No one else will do it so be confident and share examples of when you went above and beyond and when your expertise really helped. When preparing tell yourself why youre the best person for this position and have your friends family or coworkers do the same. Companies are looking for someone who is hardworking and passionate as well as someone who takes an interest in the company make sure you research the company well.

So before you that make sure you get as much out of them as possible if you decide to work there.In terms of compensation I would just assume the bonus and options will never come to fruition and you wont see any of that money unless in the contract you can see clear terms for the bonus that you feel will be achievable on a yearly basis.How many more hours are you expected to work and how do you think this will work with your family.  You have a wife and two small children missing out on milestones or putting a strain on your marriage because you have to work all the time is not going to be worth the extra money.Health insurance isnt as big of a deal as it used to be because of the ACA and you can price out a plan online and use that as part of your negotiations.  Since you have a wife and kids I would get as much in guaranteed money as possible in your salary.  If you could also have clear expectations on the contract about the expected amount of hours they want you to work each week if thats possible.  So either way definitely get a lawyer to look at your contract.,jobs,cq8s4xr,5,t5_2qhnd

3794411,1,t3_33vb30,gt Because I have developed strong feelings for a coworker Maybe learn to be professional. For those of us who are in committed relationships and try to find work people like you are the poison that deletes us.I cannot tell you how many jobs I have left because of people like you. I want to work to earn money and theres always someone who takes it to a personal and unsafe level for some of us. No one wants their partner to go to work and get hit on and I am certain you have a problem you need to seek help for.People go to work to keep their car paid their rent paid and to make money so they dont end up on the street.To me it sounds like you live at home still. Youre way out of your depth here. You dont work to meet people or get dates. I wish young people could realize work is not a place people go to rearrange their lives it is a place they go to enhance the lives they already have planned. This person probably cannot quit their job and you might even be in for a sexual harassment charge if you made your feelings known to them or their family. In all honesty it sounds like your feelings are out of control unhealthy and trumped up out of fantasies and not reality. This person might have people who they support financially. Who are you to destroy them financially? In actuality this person has probably noticed and its created a hostile work environment which is grounds for a sexual harassment suit especially if you obvious and inappropriate feelings got them someone they know fired or made someone quit.Your obsession with someone who doesnt return your feelings is not healthy.You need to realize developing feelings for someone you work with is very inappropriate unless they are single and interested.Something about you is misinterpreting their required professional politeness or requirement to get along with coworkers as feelings. This is wrong.You really have no idea what this person is doing outside of work.It seems childish of you to act as if you cant control how you feel about people who havent asked you to be in a relationship with them. If they are involved youre only going to destroy your own life.If they arent including you as a person in their life on weekends or holidays and spending their free time with you or introducing you to their families and circles outside work then youre only hurting yourself. You need to focus on a career not sex.Whatever your feelings are they seem to be out of reality and built on a fantasy or delusion you have for yourself. It sounds like this person is involved and maybe you should seek counseling. Were you abused as a child? Have you had any actual interactions here or have you fabricated this? Know this Your crush is nothing like the romantic love that occurs when two people build a life together move together and plan weddings kids and a home. You might just be a homewrecker. Are you trying to destroy lives here?If they are married or live with someone and their spouse works there or knows people who do your price may very well be a lawsuit or even prison time for wrecking someones home life. People die over that crap lose their jobs over that crap and work isnt a bar  its a place to make a living not meet people.Do you want this person to have to quit or get fired because you crossed the line?You could also get this person or someone they refer fired and get sued for not controlling yourself. Get help.People like you are bad for the workplace.What you have allowed is yourself to become invasive and toxic. Your coworker is forced to spend time with you and might have a family a partner and think you are destroying all that and hate you.I dont understand your lack of self control.,jobs,cqoskmn,-4,t5_2qhnd

Companies are notorious for not updating these things and many of the older ones and even some of the newer ones have trouble parsing complex structures like this.  What that means for you is that if youre applying through a job board even if your resume says you are qualified the applicant tracking system might not know that. The resume may never get seem by human eyes.Id recommend creating another version of your resume for job board submissions that has a more standard hierarchical structure.My second big piece of advice for this is to rework your bullets.  Every bullet should answer the question What did I do in this position that others could not  focus on results not duties.  Theres a great lesson on this by uthejabcannon actually which goes into more detail.

3980683,0,t1_cra0am7, Disconnecting your sense of selfworth with your job mostly. There are things in your control and things that are not. Someone elses opinion of you or your role is what led to the layoff but thats not an accurate representation of who you are. This is a healthy attitude to bring into a new job too in my opinion. Stop comparing yourself to others. There will always be people who are stronger richer smarter funnier more attractive etc. than you. If you value yourself by comparing yourself to others youll always lose. The phrase used in some circles is hike your own hike. Never give up. Set goals for yourself every day. A certain number of jobs applied to a phone call to follow up on a promising lead just make sure you are doing something to find a new job every single day. Stay busy. When you dont have a job youre going to be spending a few hours a day applying for jobs but you have a lot more free time than you will with a job. Use that time constructively. I would recommend spending more time with friends and family if possible or taking the time to do things you rarely have time to do while working. For me this was long hikes and frequent earlymorning kayaking trips but it can be whatever you are interested in. This much free time is also an opportunity in a way.Just to add to that I would try to spend a lot of time exercising if you can. Thats another thing you dont always have time for with a job. Exercise produces natural endorphins and youd be surprised how good you feel when you exercise every day. Remember this feeling when you do get a job. Ive always been a big saver of money and this helped me a lot to get through these periods on lowno income.

All of us have knowledge gaps I have excellent knowledge in hardware but not much in networking or printer maintenance.

Do you assess your candidates salary based on what they bring or what theyve been paid?.....gtOK now I dont follow your logic. Youre making a big leap from employees to products which makes me think you dont know a lot about how software pricing or workforce planning works. Those are two vastly different things.On the grand scheme of things selling stuff goods or services means you set a price that is both competitive and attractive to your potential buyer. An employee is basically selling their services to you. An employer is a service buyer  they exchange money for services. Both require knowledge of markets and the ability to gauge that market. Given that you use salaries from previous jobs  as your starting point tells me that the company is either incapable of correctly gauging the workforce market or is a cheapskate and is unwilling to pay competitively.Instead of paying competitively you siloh in each worker and pay them just a little more than their previous job.,jobs,cs2y8te,-1,t5_2qhnd

However sharable is a bit awkward as is has given me confidence in my way with words and ability ...  which is also a bit ironic? I think? I dont know. You mention your BA more than once in this covering letter. The resume should state that  so once is enough for example in the paragraph I quoted above As a british native my writing language skills are perfect for the UK market..  what? No. Imagine if I wrote I am Canadian and therefore I am perfect to write for this Canadian store.  it does not work.  Traveling abroad also doesnt make you stand out from the crowd and frankly writing it in this way is a turn off in my eyes. Dont put others down when you write bring yourself up. Saying My travels abroad to several continents have given me a strong cultural vantage point. or something  but dont say make me stand out. Thats not for you to decide. fast and compliant is good but compliant is a bit robotic  what about instead of compliant  if you must say it  say something more along the lines of ...proven ability to write to specific standardized requirements.. or something on those lines?

The network is solid and its all maintenance and I dont see it expanding due to budget cuts.  So with the new company Im more than likely doing the same thing.  However Ill be working less hours as im guranteed the k with a chance of a bump in  days with a promotion to what I really want to get into networking. So the ceiling is higher with the new company.

If you had left voluntarily theres a credible argument that you should give them some small amount of help as a professional courtesy but even that should be severely limited as to time and effort without asking for pay.The question here is what do you want to do? If youre not really interested in the money and youd rather tell them to go away its perfectly reasonable for you to tell them so. Something along the lines of Im sorry but the requirements of my current position preclude me from taking on any other work so Im afraid I wont be able to assist you with this any longer.

For jobs like this a certain amount of financial pain should be baked into the rate. You want them to be motivated to either get up to speed themselves to hire someone else. You dont want them calling you for stupid crap they should do themselves.Also insist on getting paid up front before you do any more work.

Its specifically about a woman who knew nothing about coding but couldnt get back into the workforce.  No one would hire her.  Then she did the coding course and had a bunch of job offers.  She was not tech savvy prior to taking the course.  In regards to the film school he was broke.  He had no money to live.  He lived with me for a while and lived off of me but I couldnt afford to take care of him either.  He was expensive to feed house and he was using my electricitywaterfood yet couldnt help pay any bills.  He sat on the computer all day long while I worked parttime most of his time was spent playing on Facebook or games.  Drove me crazy.  I finally gave him the boot and told him to move back in with his parents.  He refused to move back home with his parents.  So he sold everything he owned except for the boat.  No one would hire him.  The film school was only a way to pay for his boat rentalfood for  years.  He has no clue how he will ever pay the loans back.  Now hes been in the film program since June with all  year olds... theyre all more talented than him at storytelling editing and filmmaking.  Thats the truth.  So now that hes on this path he is not feeling great about having a career in two years as a result of school.  I think he made a mistake in choosing film school in his s.  Anyone can learn to edit and make short films on any little camcorder these days and post it to YouTube.  If you have talent it will show there.  Being in debt like that?  No reason to do it unless its the real NYU film school.  I have another friend in his s who lost his job lost his home lost his car and now lives on Skid Row.

It could also be that the hiring guys just dont like telling people no in person and are hoping youll just get the hintkeep banging your head against their wall.

You can probably consider your future opportunities with this company to be ruined.

5077303,0,t3_3khht2,I dont know where you live but where I live there are a ton of meetups geared towards web development. You could find mini classes through these meetups or groups where people work on stuff. There are also programming bootcamps which seem to have sponsorships with companies so it can be an easier route than what a CS major might have. They also have parttime classes which are typically in the evenings instead of a  hour bootcamp not including homework. That doesnt mean youll have the same depth of theoretical knowledge as a CS major. All of these things tend to happen in the evenings and some may be free. These meetups are where you build your network so you wouldnt have to go through extreme criticism from the job lords as someone who doesnt know anyone in your field of interest.General Assembly has this a web development version of Codecademy and its free  There is an HTMLCSS book by Duckett thats very visual and quiet popular. If youre interested in web dev you could start with HTMLCSS and JavaScript doesnt matter which order you choose between the two.For web design Yes its more graphicalartistic in terms of theory and rules. Back in the early s web dev and design were not clearly divided. Now things have more of a convention. HTML and CSS have evolved a lot to have stricter conventions.Also get a github and post your projects on them regardless of whether youve finished or are a beginner because there is a likelihood that people will ask. I hope this helps.A lot of traditional schools dont teach what is currently in demand on the market right now because it takes years for the curriculum to evolve and go through red tape. Plus CS teachers may not necessarily be programmers. You will learn the deep theory in these schools which will make understanding whats going on with your code a whole lot easier. Web dev and mobile app development is the only place where Ive met many people who arent formally schooled in programming getting a web dev job after a  week bootcamp coming from zero knowledge.,jobs,cuy0982,1,t5_2qhnd

Having said that as a Bay Area native I couldnt think of anywhere else Id want to live. There is so much to do here and so many places to see that its tough to fit it all in a lifetime. The food in the bay is great and while the market is very high we have a pretty great and accepting culture.

5119362,0,t1_cv31etq,It does sound like you are the only serious candidate for the role in this case.  However it was unwise of your new manager to officially offer you the role before the results of the background check came in.  An employer should extend a conditional offer  conditional on positive results from the background check  until the background check clears.  Typically the candidate should not give notice to their current employer until the background check clears and they have signed their employment contract have you signed an employment contract? If so does it say its conditional pending the background check? Sometimes people who are sure that they have stellar backgrounds encounter problems credit problems due to identity theft for example so giving notice at your current role before everything clears can be problematic. Please note I dont mean to scare you   of the time everything works out fine  A background check can be as detailed as verifying employment with each and every company checking credit and crim records and checking references.  Or it can be as simple as...well doing absolutely nothing.  Completely depends on the company  normally you sign a form giving permission for a background check that lists what the check my entail. It doesnt sound like your boss is too spiteful or mean so I dont imagine that giving your boss notice tomorrow will cause major problems.  If I were in your shoes however Id email your new manager or HR and tell them that its possible your current boss will be a bit angry at you for quitting which may be reflected in a verificationreference check. Thats just me though Im a tad paranoid  the vast majority of bosses will not try to sabotage a job hunt due to fear of being sued.  ,jobs,cv32poi,2,t5_2qhnd

5140616,0,t3_3ldo9x,Some of the comments here are pretty rude. I totally get where youre coming from. I worked as a social media manager for a website and I fucking hated every second of it. At first it was kinda fun and cool that I got to browse reddit all day to get inspiration and keep the social media accounts fun but after a year and a half I slumped into a deep depression and fantasized about quitting every single day. It was torture waking up in the morning and pushing myself to go into the office and at that point I was just working to save money since I was getting paid pretty well. Long story short the company had to end up shutting down and I was laid off. Best thing that ever happened. I traveled for a month with the money I saved and now I work part time making shit money but working with kids I also want to go to grad school for school psych and getting lab experience as a volunteer once a week at a prestigious university which will help me once I apply to school. If youre uninspired and bored as hell youre gonna get to a point where you dread going into work and at least for me it might affect your productivity in other aspects of your life. I say find something more relevant to the field youre interested in working in even if its entry level. If its part time then that can benefit you in the sense that youll have more time to focus on the things youll need to do in order to get back to school.

5234307,0,t3_3molxq,Like the others have said the best you can do is be patient and persistent. You have to get used to being rejected or ignored and it sounds like youre taking that well so far. Unfortunately its a numbers timing and networking game. The main disadvantage that you have is that youre young and have no experience. This usually translates to crappy pay and boring jobs but youll eventually get past that. The main advantage that you have right now is that you dont NEED a job in order to live hopefully.My advice is this. Try to go to a place during offpeak hours. If its a restaurant before lunch or before dinner eg. amam pmpm.. Apply to literally any place you could stand to work at. When I was applying for jobs like this Id drive to a shopping centerstrip mall and just walk into every single store and ask for an application. If it wasnt busy sometimes Id get to speak with the manager right there. I got  jobs on the spot like this.. Try local or small businesses. A place like Starbucks or McDonalds has a whole system for applying references etc. Your average corner coffee shop or mom and pop restaurant dont have the same strict guidelines and may be more willing to hire you without going through a whole process. They also may not get as many resumes and may actually pay more.. Ask everyone you know if they know of anyone who is hiring. You may not think you know anyone but your friends mom may have a bakery. Or the guy down the street runs a dry cleaning business. Find out where your friends work. Networking is sort of like treating everyone you meet could be a potential job opportunity.Hope this helps!,jobs,cvgxaak,2,t5_2qhnd

5570283,0,t3_3reywh,. Since you make a decent salary I would see a therapist to help you deal with the stress. It may seem like its a lot to pay someone to listen to you talk but it helps to unload on someone else instead of your boyfriend and friends.. Depending on your review structure your boss may be the only person that matters. A great piece of advice someone once gave me was to manage up....the only people who really matter are the people above you. Your coworkers and colleagues can say what they want but the only person you need to impress is the people above you. Spend your time and focus on that. . Figure out how long you need to stay there and build an exit strategy. Dont quit tomorrow. Find a way to make this job work for you in the immediate future but plan for the other things you want to do. Figure out how much money you need before you quit how long you need to stay what you need to build a business..etc. Even if you dont act on it immediately it will take some stress off of you knowing that you have the ability to leave.. If you plan on quitting unless you have a really great plan dont make other dramatic changes in your life. Quitting a job vs. industry vs. city at the same time is expensive and hard. Figure out what your steps are and take them one at a time. ,jobs,cwnjmfh,1,t5_2qhnd

5689053,0,t1_cx28um6,Agree that  weeks isnt much.  My most recent period of job searching took  months. I have  years experience and right at the  week mark I was feeling just like you but kept pushing.  It wasnt until  months in that things started to change.  My interviewing got better and I got smarter about which jobs I went after.  As for the rate of pay ask for what you think you are worth and act like you are worth it.  What can you bring to the table that someone less experienced cant?  My suggestion is during your interviews tell short stories as examples of how your experience came into play in previous jobs.  Once I started doing that I started getting a lot more traction. My only advice on the pay is what a seasoned recruiter told me.  I had the same issue in that I feared I was asking too much.  I was at the top of the pay range for my line of work at my last job. He told me let them know what I was making but to make it clear that Im open and want to merely be fairly compensated.  I stayed away from a specific number.  It didnt always work but eventually it did.  I eventually took a job making less but not by too much.  I hope to build my pay back up soon but it was enough compensation that felt comfortable accepting the offer without resentment.,jobs,cx2a67v,3,t5_2qhnd

Based on the work Ive seen you have the talent and the fundamental understanding of how to make things look good which is essential to success here are some recommendations I can give you that I think will help you grow as an artist and eventually help secure work in the industry Your biggest barrier has nothing to do with your abilities its where you live.  Based on your portfolio youre living in Hawaii theres not a whole lot of action there for that industry.  A recruiter for say Blizzard isnt even going to consider you for an interview because theres going to be about a hundred applicants many of which will likely have sharper portfolios than yours but most will likely be local.  Companies dont consider relocating a candidate for a job unless theyre the best candidate on the list or theres a shortage of candidates which they consider good fits moving somebody for a job is risky and adds additional costs. Youre going to get put lower on the list if you dont live where the work is for the most part Southern California is here you need to go but there are several studios all along the west coast and theres plenty of work. Beef up your portfolio  You have a lot of work but theres nothing showcasing what youre best at.  What is your specialty?  Is it quick sketch drawings storyboard artist need to be good at this is it fully rendered D models or environments?  Whatever you consider your specialty focus the portfolio on that and get as many good fully completed pieces as you can.  Additionally always be taking life drawing classes and get some good life drawing samples up there.  In this day in age the artists who get the jobs are the ones who can do a lot of different things and strong life drawings are essential to any portfolio. Draw more I dont know how much youre drawing but whatever it is do more of it.  The guys I know who have the good jobs spent a lot of time drawing I mean they fucking drew like  hours a day thats how you go from being a good artist to being a pro the more you do you the better you get.  My friend I mentioned who created Hawken was basically painting nonstop when we were in high school by the time he got into art school he couldve probably already been working as a pro but he didnt start out that way practice made him amazing and thats what any artists who wants to do it for a living has to do you gotta draw...A LOT.  Make yourself a challenge fill up a sketchbook a month.As for what other types of work you can do theres plenty but again where you live is going to really be a significant barrier.  You can freelance you can do graphic design although you mentioned you didnt like it I dont blame you you need to be drawing epic characters doing cool shit not no logos aint nobody got time for that or you could just get a part time job doing something not art related and spend the rest of that time drawing and getting yourself even better.  Also consider continuing your education ever think of going to a place like Art Center?  You could do it and that would be a HUGE stepping stone to your dream.Alright I hope this has helped you.  Good luck!Edit Grammar and formatting and stuff,jobs,cxj61v7,1,t5_2qhnd

Revamprebuildrebrand yourself after learning more about yourself from step  and  aboveI was in a similar situation...I changed my major...I dont know....at very least  times. I am still going to school but I found out that I am better doing codingdoing something nonrepetitive than doing something repetitive. Unfortunately a bad boss has the power to make anyone hate their most beloved profession so no one is exempt from those situations.If I were in your shoes and I was before I would learn about myself first perhaps with an MBTI test Free here and an investment in a StrengthsFinder . test which costs about . StrengthsFinder .MBTI will reveal to you more about who you are as a person.StrengthsFinder will reveal to you more about your actual strengths. This maymay not coincide with your MBTI results.After you have learned about the above results do a selfassessment of your self with your resume at the side and see if you notice any disconnects. Be honest but dont give your self excuses to not like a situation if all things didnt go the way you wanted them. Try it out and see if this reveals things you probably never considered.The other part of this is to revamp your self essentially rebuild yourself. I work with  people whose degrees are Biology. Yes and they all do IT work more detailed and complicated than what I know. Lastly the th person I know doesnt have a degree and this person is fully employed. The catch is that they are in IT and the skills are in demand but how did they do it after graduating?  of them is super interested in learning about IT the other got a cert that is moderately difficult but not impossible to get  more somehow got a start in IT before it was competitive and stayed in it and another was into computers since age  and just taught himself everything he knows about computersservers through online material.I am still in school but I had to change my majors several times. The hilarious part of it is that my current job has very little to what I am learning in school even though both are IT. This was what was needed in the business to solve a problem and I learnt it on the weekends.Damn this became a wall of text if you made it this far.,jobs,cxla446,7,t5_2qhnd

6006184,1,t1_cy6qoqj,Theres a lot of sweeping generalization and assumption thats flaming the HRhate fire. As a selection consultant who saw how hiring was done strategically and terribly I want to clear up a few things when people keep advocating that networking is our savior.First of all this is not something that HR loves to do. Relying on references may be ONE method to source an applicant pool but it is in no way the best or only way. Employers who are worth their salt would not blindly rely on subjective heavilybiased selfreports to build their workforce and grown their organizations. Does it happen? Yes but more often this tactic is committed by hiring managers or external recruiters who arent close with the hiring needs and just need to do whatever it takes when the applications pour in.Secondly its difficult to hire in general. But its not hard to find qualified candidates if they put some effort into it. Most organization will conduct a job analysis even a very simple one like reviewing historical records to understand who they need to hire. From there they search out and use a set of interviewing methods that best fit their needs. They dont always need to slam a mountain of resumes against an ATS and slash down the volume. Were not at a lost about the hordes of applicants that we simply break down and cry and do ANYTHING we can just to hire somebody. Again if you are a hiring manager or recruiter who dont know about those various methods you would LOVE the idea that hiring is as simple as waiting on an incumbent employee to tell you about this one person they know...When you see that Personnel Selection has a lot of flexibility and options hiring based on references seems kind of farcical and outlandish.Wow I almost forgot how much this place loves to hate on HR for no good reason.,jobs,cy6xwjj,-8,t5_2qhnd

You have to really ramp up your applications  in this economy Im not exaggerating when I advise people to send out a couple hundred applications within  months. LA is a huge area  there should be new entry level white collar jobs popping up all the time. Another tip is to work on your timing  make sure you apply to newly posted jobs. Dont even apply to jobs that have been up on job boards for  weeks or over a month. Subscribe to job alerts and apply ideally within the first  days they are posted. In the meantime start writing articles blog posts book reviews a draft of a book or whatever  make use of that philosophy degree and remember who you are and what is your passion. Start submitting your writing to different press sites and try to get some freelancing on the side in addition to your manual labor jobs.

6303214,1,t1_cz61ggh,gt The persons resume should be sufficient enoughI disagree. The persons resume could be a complete fabrication. I think of the resume as a starting point for a discussion of whether we should hire you or not.The people that I interview are seeking US K annually and I interview them before the company runs its background check on the candidate. Its my responsibility to perform due diligence when I evaluate the candidate and a lot of my evaluation occurs in the hours and days before I sit down to interview them.Ive sat on the other side of the table in an interview with an interviewer who was reviewing my resume for the first time. Thats not me. If my manager is bringing you in for an interview Im spending an hour researching you checking your qualifications and formulating  questions that I want you to answer in our half hour together.If I have a resume from a candidate claiming  years of increasing responsibility developing widgets and yet they dont have the confidence to make the same claim on the internet with their name attached its going to strike me as odd.gt Judging someones social media profile shouldnt be a qualifier for the job. Thats like asking someone if you can see their Facebook Twitter Youtube...and whatever other social media account the may or may not have.When I research a candidate I am going to Google them and see what kind of presence they have on the Internet. If the person has an arrest record I want to know that. If the person doesnt have a LinkedIn account Im going to notice that. If the resume indicates that they have a degree Im going to check out the course catalog.Sure a LinkedIn account isnt required to be a professional and neither is a firm handshake yet I notice if a candidate has neither one.And specifically Im not looking for any of these other accounts. I only specifically notice the LinkedIn account.gt Ive been contacted by some recruiters through it but nothing tangible has come out of it. I keep it updated but I dont spend hours upon hours trying to rack up contacts like its some contestThats cool. Personally I just copy sections from my resume into my experience fields on my LinkedIn accounts whenever Im looking for a job. I probably only edit my own account once or twice a year. Im not looking for accuracy Im looking to see if a candidate is willing to make the same claims on the Internet that they do in their resume.gt I only have  contacts...does that mean Im not serious about my career compared to the people who have  and spend money on the premium serviceIm not worried about how many contacts a candidate has though fewer than  would stand out if the candidate claimed  years of experience. If you cant even convince your friends to be your LinkedIn connection are you the sort of candidate that I want to work with  hours a week?gt Give me a break...is this what our workforce as come to? In  in the United States for a white collar role I would argue yes.

6304419,0,t3_41y3sc,There can be many factors affecting your success including.  The degree to which your education and experience meet the job requirements.  If the job postings youre responding to are requiring a Bachelors degree and you have a Masters degree the companies may feel youre overqualified.  If you lack the required amount of job experience they may deem you underqualified..  The amount of research you do about the company and the hiring manager.  Many applicants fail to address a resume to a decision maker and instead submit it to HR or Recruiter..  The degree to which your resume uses the language in the job posting.  Many applicants use a generic resume for all the jobs they apply to instead of tailoring the resume to use the specific terms of each individual job posting..  Failing to followup on applications that are submitted.  Recruiters are busy people inundated with resumes applications and requests from hiring managers.  I always suggest that applicants followup to ensure their resumeapplication was received and to find out the timeline for interviews of selected applicants and a hiring decision.  A day or two before the interviews are supposed to begin followup and reiterate your interest in the position..  Failure to followup with a thank you and short recap of what makes you the perfect match for the position and reiteration of your interest in the job..  Failure to adequately prepare for the interview..  Failure to ask relevant questions during the interview..  Individuals who dont treat their job search like a fulltime job have significantly lower success rates than those who do. How much time are you devoting to your job search..  Individuals who rely on applications rather than networking have significantly lower success rates than those who network more effectively.If you want to discuss further feel free to PM me.,jobs,cz68pq9,1,t5_2qhnd

6399148,0,t1_czgvna7,To be fair to get into ANY school you have to figure out some redeeming things to put on your application. You still have to prove youre interested in finance in some way and that you can do well in school. This may include taking some undergrad classes in finance  or just taking a nondegree class at Georgetown or Penn and excelling. This is known as the backdoor to getting into a strong masters program.You can also try other schools like Univ of Miami or John Hopkins. Theyll be less competitive but you can still get your foot in the door.As a piece of advice and not to be mean If you cant do well in a provisional undergrad finance class or a nondegree grad course than Id strongly reconsider trying to get into Wall Street. The MF degree is expensive and the job is very competitive to get into and grueling as a whole. One of the reasons they have a high bar for a GPA and a top school because they presume that if you can punch out hours of studying in a tough environment than you can work for  hours a day.,jobs,czh0mzp,1,t5_2qhnd
6403536,0,t3_43aa2y,It looks like from your user name that you are most likely in Illinois. That is in your favor because Illinois is not yet despite your Republican governors best efforts a righttowork state. That is probably why you got a fairly generous two months salary separation package.Given all that there is a lot of good advice posted here. Redditters are pretty smart in general. Naturally you apply for unemployment first thing. In order to qualify weekly you will have to meet some sort of requirements for an employment search. Dont take some time to decompress that is crap. You are probably going to get all the time off you can stand so get going. Start your job search by making a sincere effort to find a job while certifying your unemployment weekly or whatever the states requirement is and if that leads to employment good on you. But and this is key immediately after your unemployment runs out  weeks in many states find a job any job and get back to work. McDonalds whatever the key is to be employed. The  weeks on unemployment is going to be hard enough to explain as it is. Meanwhile continue your search for your technology job.  And dont forget to apply for COBRA as soon as you can. Maintaining continuity of insurance might be important later. It will probably be expensive but at least look into it and quickly.I hope things work out for you quickly. I have been in the same situation as you are in and living in a righttowork state my severance consisted of one months insurance coverage that was all.To repeat taking time to decompress and all that is horse crap. Get back to work as quickly as you can. Best of  luck to you.,jobs,czhimc9,1,t5_2qhnd

I was offered early on some opportunities to leave and I didnt want it to look bad so I stayed. I did the projects that were out of scope and I had no knowledge of how to operate. I took on a role where everyone else had quit before me had no training and I thought that by handling it I would somehow be rewarded.What happened? I stayed for years taught myself  of this job and I still get yelled at every day for things Im supposed to know. No one acknowledges the fact that I came in with a bad situation and no training and took a job no one else can handle. Also because I stayed and its been a bit its too late to fill those learning gaps. No one cuts me any slack or time to learn things someone should have trained me  years ago.But they did make improvements for the new hires. So they got the training the support and the slack and they get to stand in front of management with bright eyes while I hold the baggage of years of getting yelled at. They will most likely get promoted faster than me since everyone thinks Im a horrible person.In short get a new job. If youre int his job for less than a year dont even put it on your resume.

There arent enough of these customers to comprise a sustainble sales funnel. Network marketing fills this gap by making recruits out of customers which is even more manipulative.If your employer requires you to pay for the product you are responsible to sell it is by definition a scam even if its a great product honest sales are too rare when the company refuses to cough up for a real marketing communications program.If it were me I would ask for a cooling off before I alienate more of my friends.

Everyone wants money and a quick check of your resume and technical questions gives them a good idea of whether or not you can complete your responsibilities.  Thered be no point in interviewing you just to get those two things across.  They want to know if youre a good fit for the company and if you really want this position beyond the pay.For phonescreensinterviews I always write out a long list of questions and prioritize the most important ones as time allows.  If you are unsure of what questions to ask a quick google search will yield many lists of s of viable questions.  Dont ask questions for the sake of asking.  Listen to answers and respond effectively to show why youre a good candidate.  Asking the question shows youve thought about the position seriously and then responding to the answer gives you an opportunity to show some good feature about you whether it be a skill or a preference for the company culture or something else.,jobs,d069zvh,1,t5_2qhnd
6642020,0,t1_d06bkdw,Shes been trying to get me fired about  weeks before I told her I was pregnant so part of that precedes it. Basically theres been a  month investigation into my actions at work. They havent found a damn thing but HR wont close the investigation in fact I wasnt even supposed to know I was being investigated except one of the HR underlings told me. My boss has been trying to trap me in situations that could compromise my job. Its just fucked up. Basically shes a bully and I refused to let her bully me. Finding out Im pregnant has just been fun for her to play with. I told her as I get into the later parts of my pregnancy that I will probably need to be moved into a less physical job. All she said was My OB told me women used to work in fields and ride horses until the day they gave birth so well see. I mean yes they did but they also had a  mortality rate so maybe it wasnt such a great idea. The hours thing she said oh since you were worried about overworking yourself we reduced your hours. I told her I was fine and could do my job just fine now I was talking about later in my pregnancy. My hours went up about  hours but its because Im training new people these past few weeks.,jobs,d06cc48,4,t5_2qhnd

6697278,0,t3_479jr2,The person who wrote the piece you shared definitely facing the kind of problems he is because he is older age discrimination is an issue in any field and probably didnt keep his skills up to date.  Also as someone else pointed out location is HUGE. Im in the environmental field and there are plenty of jobs to go around where I live outside of a major US city.  It took me a few months to find my first job out of college but after i put in a couple years there environmental consulting companies were practically knocking down the door to get me.   My advice if you want to increase your chances in this industry is try to focus on a specialty.  Professional geologists are very in demand right now so a geology degree might be better than just a general environmental science degree.  Another big area is water resource engineering.  Like any industry you need to pay your dues before you can get to the good stuff.  Youll probably find yourself either working pretty long hours and a lot of field work for an environmental consultant or making much less in the public sector for your first job but after a couple years youre golden.  Being willing to do field work will be your  asset starting out so make sure thats really something you enjoy.Good luck,jobs,d0c21hf,1,t5_2qhnd

Startups will always offer less than market value or equal to it but this is well below market. By a lot. I thought it was a convenient way to get cheap labour too but after I read some articles online its starting to become common in startups so that they can get a feel for the employee before committing to them because its essential to have the right people on board that early on in the companys life.

In California which is an at will employment state it really doesnt matter what the job offer says  you can quit with exactly  notice and your employer cant do shit about it. Other locations may have notice requirements that state you must provide a certain amount of notice about leaving your job. If not legally required the notice period is just a professional courtesy  one that you extend in exchange for a positive job reference and to show that you wish to allow your employer a smooth transition. In this situation I dont see your job extending any professional courtesies to you.Perhaps next time an employer promises you the moon you should insist they put some of these terms in writing. How long have you worked that you havent seen any of what you were promised materialize?EDIT I should add that if your job offer has your other compensation promises in writing re time off re pay raises then I would be requesting to meet with HR and your supervisors to discuss being made whole according to the terms of your employment contract.

I was looking for an internship and then my professor had a job offer come across his desk. The job I currently work at I am in no way qualified for IMO. I went to the interview on a whim as practice and they offered me the job an hour later. Obviously this isnt a job for someone licensed or way above my head but most people at least have a certificate or AAS in accounting to do my job. Once I started working I realized I knew how to do the work but the job listing was requesting  years of experience and I had NONE. I was terrified before I started but I hadnt lied to them about anything so they knew my qualifications.So I say go for some entry level stuff maybe even things a with a few years of experience! The worst that can happen is you dont get the job. Just DONT LIE about your experience and youll be fine. I think a lot of job offers ask for high expectations so try and weed out the people who are wildly under qualified and wont try hard enough in the position.,jobs,d0zb6ec,2,t5_2qhnd

Confident yes. But never comfortable. If he has the tie already he has nothing to lose by wearing it.

Or at least not as specialized as it is now. With the implementation of ICD there is still a need for highly trained coders but many facilities will still want someone with experience as well. I recommend a program approved by AHIMA or something that will qualify you for the CCACCS AHIMA Coding Certifications. There is the CPC offered through AAPC which is another well recognized coding certification. If youre looking at HIM programs make sure it is a CAHIIM accredited program so that you are eligible to sit for the RHITRHIA as these are very in demand certifications. Coding and HIM are in the same department but are very different aspects so it really depends on what you are wanting to do. If youre interested in PrivacyHIPAAComplianceData go with HIM.

Youre not longer a new grad that recruiters target. You are very quickly coming up to a timeframe where your degree is thats nice... you went to collegeIm glad you still live at home and have someone pay your bills and you dont feel an urgency to do something with your life. Thats a great place to be. Until you have to do something and grow up and get a job.gt I ended up quitting that job  months later as I found out first hand I just couldnt handle the stress of actual lifeordeath situationsemergencies etc.You majored in criminal justice and cant handle reality and lifeordeath situations? You need to talk to mom and dad and see if you can go back to schoolgtMy previous restaurant employer would definitely accept me back but I wanted to apply to other places first just because as far as restaurantsretail places in the area its definitely the most hecticbusy.You graduated  years ago and you need to be a GROWN UP. GO GET A JOB!gtSince then Ive had two interviews for minimum wage stuff but didnt get them which Im again  sure is because Im overqualifiedTo do WHAT? From what youve said you have waited tables and couldnt hack it in dispatch. Youre qualified to be an order taker. Thats it. gtI also have a few career based jobs that I really think Ill get at least an interview its just a matter of the prerequisite  weeks or whatever it is until you get a response about an interview etc.Wow. Must be nice to live off mommys dime.... and not give a crap about life.gtNow my mom is really starting to freak out and get stressed about me not having any job at all mainly because she thinks its going to hurt me either at interviews or just applying for these career jobs by having areas of unemployment on my resume. UM. Your mom is freaking out because she thinks youre never going to grow up and become a neckbeard in her basement because you cant get a job or support yourself. At some point? She needs to be done raising you. You need to leave the nest. From my quick math  if you graduated HS at   and took  years in college  and graduated  years ago  You are in your late s and have nothing on a resume worth a crap.gtI argue that I can just tell the truth as it seems to make sense to me that I cant even get minimum wage jobs because Im overqualified and theyre scared Ill leave because Ive gotten a career job which to be fair is true.I wouldnt hire you for a call center but its not because youre over qualified.gtIts similar to my  job I resigned from shes also wondered if me quitting that is going to hurt her but Ive argued that since the reason I quit was because of the emergency aspect of the field and not being just bad at the job in fact theyve said they would give me a good reference in the future since I was good at the actual job duties that it wont hurt me since Ill only be applying for jobs without the emergency aspect.You were a criminal justice major... you know what you majored in right? You understand the career field?gtI mean its not like Im going to quit looking or anything because of this if Im right its just that I can try to explain this to her and not feel so antsy about NEEDING any job whatsoever.... I dont technically NEED a job aka Im not going to go homeless or starve without an income I just have to deal with still living at home haha.Hi mom... you know.. I dont need a job because you take care of me and Ive never actually had a job so I dont need one know because I dont know what the hell I want to do and I want to blame you for the sense of urgency because I cant work in my chosen field and I cant hold down a job but thats not important because you pay my way so  YOU ARE WRONG MOM!TLDR Grow up and go get a fucking job.,jobs,d16l6al,32,t5_2qhnd

Basically they fear youll jump ship very soon and theyll be going through the pain and hassle of interviewing again in a few months. Your response should ease those fears.

Mention that you have roots or will be putting down roots in the area  your kids in the local school you joining a local sports team buying a houseleasing an apartment etc. Anything that sounds quaint and long term.

7013180,0,t3_4bpf9u,Well...it kind of depends on your specific situation. Some companies will give you a  raise each year as long as you were average or good just to keep up with inflation. If you really think youre an allstar do some work before the review and write out why you think you deserve more than that amount. Did you save the company money last year? Did you do something more efficiently than your coworkers? Did you create something for the company? Take an honest look at what you did for the company last year. If you were generally in line with expectations then your position is somewhat limited but not impossible.If you werent an allstar thats not the end of the world. Theres still a chance that youre being paid below marketrate for your position. Do some research on glassdoor indeed etc. for your position at similar companies. Or check job postings. Or ask around if its possible. Go in there with as much information as possible about the going rate for someone with your level of experience and skills whos working at your current job. Then negotiate.However if you were an allstar then youll have a lot to talk about. Go in there with a summary of everything that you did for the company over the past year. This should come up on their end but if it doesnt youll be able to remind them. Doing this selfassessment before you go in will also better prepare you for what theyre going to say. Did you really mess something up back in June? Going in knowing that they might bring it up is better than being blindsided because you forgot all about it.Ok so you were an allstar? Great. Let them tell you all about your year and let them offer you a raise andor bonus. Great! More money! Thank them for that and then its time for you to tell them how you werent just a typical employee you were a rock star. Go over in detail all of the ways that you were awesome. At the end tell them that you appreciate the  raise but you really think that  or whatever is more in line with the achievements youve had over the past year as well as the research that youve done on similar positions in the industry. Then just wait. You may get everything you wanted. They may counter. They may laugh or say youre being ridiculous youre not  you did your research. They may tell you they dont have it in the budget right now to give you more than they offered. Whatever they say you have options.. If they accept your initial counter congratulations. Thats it though. You cant really ask for anything after that.. If they counter you can counter back or accept. Repeat until youre satisfied.. If they counter and you go back and forth but youre just not happy counter with something different. Say they counter with a  raise you can come back with an extra week of vacation or personal days instead of the initial raise that you asked for.. If they flat out refuse to counter you at all and give you a take it or leave it mentality try to switch it to vacation days or something.. If they refuse to give you a raise at all or counter you or anything the last thing you can do is ask when you can meet again to discuss a raise. A year is a long time to wait so would it be possible to meet again in  months? ? etc.As far as what you can negotiate it again depends on your company. The most common ones are salary and vacationpersonal days. Vacation is a little easier for them to give you sometimes too. And you can negotiate a mix of things. And a raise is probably better to negotiate than a bonus so if you get a bonus Id probably just leave it alone. So saying something like thank you for the  raise but I really think a  raise and an extra week of vacation are more in line with my accomplishments is totally acceptable.,jobs,d1bailq,2,t5_2qhnd

If this is consulting which Im guessing it is in some form youll have to learn to kinda live with that and utilize your time in other ways. I had a lovehate relationship with my boss for the same reason. The thing is theyll never like fire you or even criticize you for doing your job well but as you said the positives dont necessarily come out either cause they would love to bill the full amount.,jobs,d1jgr1a,2,t5_2qhnd

While realistically no you dont need to spell out why you elected to still take the day off as someone else mentioned this is one of those situations where you really need to pick your battles.  I think a vague response such as the suggested It got changed after you got the day off so you kept the day off and used it to schedule an appointment you have been putting off. is enough to satisfy the question of why did you still use PTO without giving too much detail.  Good luck and congrats!!,jobs,d1jjl50,1,t5_2qhnd

7093408,0,t3_4cpza2,I am doing this now but looking in a different city across the state.Usually you will have a first touch with HR or a recruiter who will ask you if your current employer is aware that you are looking. When you tell them no and request to not contact your company they will honor your request.Im especially struggling leaving work for interviews because it takes at least half of the day.  If you are looking for work in town it will be much easier.Do not post your resume publicly on job sites obviously. And try not to make any absencestime off look suspicious or do it too often.

Its up to the manager to decide how to manage these tradeoffs.Everything is good and bad. Turnover churn leadership niceness loyalty are all just words for items that say what is on the table for tradeoffs.  Its a broad topic and approach and thats when a skilled manager has to evaluate what is the best case of actionI think youre missing the point a bit that you think this is something specific its not its business goals. Turnover and churn are not that different than building a plant making an investment training and recruiting programs. Its how you operate with limited resources.A managers job is to evaluate the tradeoffs between options. Truly skilled managers do this very well and the most skilled are able to put more options on the table and better evaluate their effects.Turnover churn loyalty short term vs. long term are just words to describe tradeoffs.

I just got really pessimistic and felt kinda used after that plus it just seemed to confirm what everyone was saying about how McDonalds only cares about your availability and your interview doesnt matter and I think I found it a lot harder to try in the next  interviews I did I was so focused on emphasising how flexible I was with my hours how I could work pretty much any shift and how I live so nearby and can get to work so easily on short notice etc etc that I probably neglected everything else...I will try the university careers centre but as far as I know they are more focused on career advice every time I have thought of going there I always end up making excuses to get out of it because I feel so selfconscious at the idea of going there to ask for help getting a job at McDonalds when it seems like theyre really there to give advice on getting into things like law or medicine.,jobs,d1zmt3n,1,t5_2qhnd

I replied within the hour with the time I picked. She replied that time was not available anymore and to to pick another one. I did and she replied that she would confirm. I asked to whom I would be speaking with and she replied she would let me know once they confirmed I thought that was odd. Confirm? Her email said it was confirmed. I waited for the email of the info. Nothing. I called and got her voicemail that she was now on vacation for  week and to contact soandso if assistance was needed. I left a voicemail. She never contacted me. I tried to email her but nothing. I was pissed. The day of the interview I called again but nothing. I then get a call from the interviewer asking if there was a miscommunication and if I was interested. I called and had to leave a nice voicemail explaining what happened and that I was still interested. I followed it up with an email I found it on the website and said I left a voice message but still interested. He emailed me back to say he was not ignoring me but trying to find out what happened. Later that day I get a call from the recruiter apologizing but saying that the email I used to register on the company site and the one I used in the email I sent her and on my resume were different and it was confusing. I was nice about it but mentioned that my email stated the time and date of the interview and my cell phone number which was also on the website registration. She kind of got stern and said it was confusing. I asked why her backup never contacted me and she said she would have to find out. I never heard back. I hate it when recruiters are flakey go on vacation and dont tell you and never give you the information you need. I will be posting my experience on Glassdoor too. ,jobs,d2kwqof,1,t5_2qhnd

Glassdoor.com often has salary information for jobs that share common location responsibilities and titles.Start budgeting go to rpersonalfinance and learn how to keep track of your money and live accordingly.Also this is just a sidenote but dont just plan on getting a masters degree because you want to. Realistically LOOK at the numbers and information and see if the masters degree will be a good investment. A Masters degree in Social Work rates as one of the  worst returns on investment. Just having the degree will not guarantee a highpaying job or a job that will even be able to pay for the degree itself for that matter. If you want to do it for career advancement you might be best served gaining more work experience instead.

That was the only question I was asked during the entire hour there. He went back to discussing pay the owners personality the weather but never asked me questions. It was weird. Everyone I told this to said that they likely took one look at me and decided then and there I was not the right man for the job. Turns out they were right since they never called me back.

7718576,0,t1_d1ml2iq,Hi  sorry for late response but I am interested and looking for your feedback. I am the first coined Data Analyst at my company where really I was a Business Analyst who picked up and found SQL to be interesting Intermediate at best. On top of that I have what you would consider standard Excel skills Pivot Tables  vlookups. Nothing special. My problem is I do not know where to go from here. Its almost a Catch since my company runs off of data but they do not allow us to expand on the KPIs they are accustomed to. Reports are fairly straightforward and anything somewhat interesting gets handed to a programmer to build into our application. We just acquired a BI solution to handle a portion of our reporting that I am responsible for implementing but at the end of the day I dont think I am truly benefiting from it. Since the role of DA was essentially created for me to excel in can you suggest anything I may be able to do to take the next step from a basic analyst to the true owner of data where the business seeks my input? My goal is to use the niche I created to build out a team and hopefully keep moving up through the data ranks but I feel Im stagnating.

You might switch that Application for your position as XYZ to something more along the lines of I am writing this letter to express my interest in the position of XYZ within your company. Then you can go on to explain what you know of the company what you know of the position and why you think you would make a good addition to their team. You can attach your resume of course so that they can look it over and make the decision if you would be a good fit. You want to make it enticing enough that they send you a message back with Thank you for your interest but at this time we are not hiring for position XYZ. However we will keep your resume on file and get back with you if an opening occurs. It might also be a possibility that while position XYZ isnt available but an overlapping or similar position is open and theyll offer it to you.Dont go over a standard page but try to get all the information you need in the letter. Dont reiterate your resume in the letter they can read that if your letter grabs them.Its been a while since I sent that kind of letter to a company so hopefully that will help you get started at least.

Its up to your employer to decide whether or not they can accommodate you coming inleaving earlier. As long as you present it in a way that shows your work wouldnt be affected a reasonable employer would be okay with compromising but youd have to put in the effort to make it worthwhile for them to do so.Ultimately Id put the ball in their court. If youre not planning on staying then its better to be honest and risk losing the position than risk your reputation lying to your employer.

Im reluctant to say what it is specifically as I havent seen one with it yet. Im sure there is one but not one around here. Unfortunately the studio in Dallas wasnt interested in a remote job but I DID find an offsite job in...Boston? Fingers crossed that they reply. Theres also a colleague of mine that has a team gonna try and join up with him. He gave some FB groups to market myself so Ill try that for the time being. And for the record I dont have money for anything. weed or gas. All my accounts are  empty. Generally I can budget but when Im at  theres not anything TO budget. I thought about it all day today and really the only thing I can think of is to try and market myself on said FB groups until one of my clients sends me something. I wish I could work as a bouncer but being  lbs Im not intimidating in the least. Though the sign painter would be a great idea if my town had new businesses. This town is dead most of the businesses I hit whenever I was doing the sales job are closed now. And they had barely opened at that time. The economy here is toxic. I live in a town of  people and maybe  businesses. Most being oilfield related. There are no actual online job posts and any job opening is quickly flocked towards. I did try and apply to a CNC shop as I studied that in high school but they had already chosen a candidate with some  years experience and his own tools. Older adults work the grocery store Im competing with the whole town for any job I apply to. Regarding waiting for my girlfriend its because I dont see much of an option unless I can move out of this town. She has  year left of school and her credit isnt ruined like mine. I had such a terrible time trying to find a place in Dallas that would rent to me Im sure that now it would be twice as difficult given my credit and financial status. ,jobs,d48gbeg,1,t5_2qhnd

Is it something that will require full time hours during the school year or something where they generally hire students and then accommodate their class schedules?  Are you planning on quitting when you go back to school?  Is it a place where you can see yourself working beforeafter class or working there next summer?    It costs a lot of money to hire someone.  There are a lot of admin costs time lost for training revenue lost for unproductive new workers etc.  Is it fair to ask a company to make this investment in you if youre only going to be able to stay two months?    Put yourself in the companys shoes.  If you were seeking a full time employee would you knowingly hire someone in your situation?  Why or why not?    Lets turn the tables.  What if the company advertised a position as full time but secretly knew it would reduce hours after two months.  Would you say well alls fair in love and war and employment or would you come on Reddit looking for advice when youre not getting the hours you were promised?    Be honest with the hours you can work.  If youre only available for the summer dont bother applying.

8046514,0,t3_4pfbio,Im no expert but I can probably help give you some guidance. gt I hand resumes in all the time online and never gotten a single call or email back for an interview. How does your resume look like? Do you reach out to them after you send it in? Are you working on cover letters? Im almost positive you could gather some feedback on rresumes. Thatd be a good first step. Im sure theres tons of people that can give you feedback on building a resume without a ton of work experience.Since you dropped out at  do you plan on getting at least your GED? Ill be honest it might be tough for you to land a job without at least a high school diploma but as far as options go you might want to look into manual labor type jobs for now at least.gt  I feel hopeless i cant seem to find work no matter how hard i try. Applying online blindly is super tough. What type of jobs are you applying for? Are you looking into Warehouses? Have you checked out landscaping or any sort of construction site jobs? Have you googled Jobs without high school degrees? How far into this have you looked? The greatest thing about the internet is you have access to all of this stuff and you can figure out ways to go about it. Showing that type of determination will help you not only find a job but in life in general. Where Im trying to get at is if something isnt working in your case finding a job by just applying find other ways of approaching it.Heres some advice if applying seems to just feel like its going nowhere reach out to people. Im sure your parents know someone or your friends know someone or someone in high school knows someone. Thats networking. Even though I applied to almost every damn place in my city the actual jobs Ive landed were from people I knew or were referenced or knew a company that was hiring. That may not be helpful to some but it just worked out for me personally.The places you applied to as well give them a shout and see if you can call and talk to the hiring manager. If you dont know who it is call in and ask. That shows initiative.What you should be taking away from this post is that there are different approaches to looking for jobs. I learned a lot of this just from being jobless a few times and having to dig deep and find other ways. There is no one set way to land a job if that was the case everyone would have one. Best of luck I hope anything I said helped.gt Id be willing to work in anything as long as i get paid...This is more of a side edit. I wouldnt bring this up and out right say it if you happen to land an interview or talk to someone. Were all out here just to get paid. Show it in your work ethic the more it shows you care about what you do the more money this could possibly land you in the future.,jobs,d4ki5wi,1,t5_2qhnd

From what I know CCNA is more regarded in networking than net and is often considered as a great starting point for networking.

8081452,0,t3_4pnb7h,I had that exact thing happen to me! For a new job I asked for a higher salary and they said no. So I asked for a signing bonus and they had no problem with that! So it wasnt a money issue per se it had to do with the salary limits on the position.Other times it is a money issue and even a signing bonus isnt an option. If youre not willing to walk away after a rejected request you should ask for something nonmonetary. Ex an early annual reviewopportunity to revisit your compensationposition in  months additional vacation days flextime telecommute option etc. Employers love that  month revisit offer. Seriously I just got it again at my newest job.Ive negotiated a lot and always came away with more than was originally offered. Only once I had to walk away and they came back with more a few weeks later after I took another position!I wish I remembered the conversations more but I at least remember some highlights and outcomes All of my salary requests were met with a slightly lower number or denied.  On the salary denials I was able to get a signing bonus another gave me an additional midyear bonus and once I had to walk away.No one ever just said ok sure to my requests except one time when I asked for an extra week of vacation. So when asking for money you absolutely have to overshoot the dollar amount you want. I was always prepared with some reasons why I was worth what I was asking. Market salary for my title vs. my current salary my skill set my company contributions and their  effect when I had it. So by prepared I mean I researched and even typed that shit up!

I took my lunch break went to my local eye doctor and he sorted it out I have special contacts and the lens was torn and I had to order a new one but when I got back to work something peculiar happened the next day. They sat me down in the office and did a media test where they see if Im correctly able to compound things and see the demarcations in the glassware. I get real close just to make sure Im spoton and I could tell they were secretly worried I was too blind to be able to do my job correctly and would make a mistake.The employment contract I signed said I could be late eight times before even being reprimanded. A few days later I was sat down and fired for being late for the second time by a few minutes. Im pretty sure my visual problems were the reason for this because when I asked about the discrepancy between their policy and what was happening they said I could file a grievance with HR or some nonsense. Because this happened Im terrified about revealing anything about a health issue because really why hire a potential liability?

And as far as comparing learning CAD to photoshop all i mean is i KNOW i can learn it given my academics selfexperience and drive if i just took the time to. And I am definitely NOT considering applying to large corporate companies Im just hoping there are lots of small businesses out there that MIGHT consider me.. this is mainly what im hoping to hear from fellow redditors that there are small businesses out there that will overlook certain past mistakes if the employee is a remarkable one?

But since you decided to bring my post history into this lets talk about it.  I left  of the  jobs because of a highly stressful and volatile environment.  Two hostile takeovers one major restructuring.  This is not stability.  Furthermore I AM NOT the only one leaving so dont pin this on me as if the problem is unique to me.  Several people have left prior to me as a result of the instability and stress so its clearly an environment not worth staying in for many people.  The problem isnt lack of jobs its lack of stability.  A  year or  year mortgage no longer makes sense.  I actually feel bad for even buying my house because now Im always stressed that Im about to lose my job and in turn lose the house and everything else Ive worked hard for.

8353776,0,t3_4u02dm,The reason for this is that by law in the US if an hourly worker is scheduled to work and shows up on time and ready and willing to work a full shift but is sent home early or told to start later resulting in less than four hours of work that person is still owed a minimum of two hours pay or half the shifts pay up to hrs pay whichever is greater.  This is called reporting time pay.Technically this doesnt apply if you ask for time off or show up late its just supposed to protect employees from managers cutting your shift on short notice and to make sure youre fairly compensated for your time since youve dedicated the time in your schedule to be there precluding you from doing other work.The problem for management is that an employee leaving early of his own accord vs. being sent home are almost indistinguishable.  If you sue your employer over labor violations it is hard to prove which one happened leaving the company liable for huge labor violation damages if you work . hrs of an hr shift and are paid for less than  hours.  This is also why your supervisor is probably trained to ask you would you like to leave early? in the form of a question whenever he sends you home early or cuts your shift.  If no one ever works less than  hours this rule never comes into effect.  It wouldnt be surprising if your supervisor was told to never have short shifts by higherups who created this policy so that no one ever has to deal with this rule and risk violating it. Theres also a good chance your supervisor just doesnt fully understand the rule.  Hes not an HR professional nor a lawyer.,jobs,d5lrwwv,2,t5_2qhnd

8375227,0,t3_4ubnbv,Political Science is one of the broader disciplines and its really about narrowing down a path in it to make life easier and kinda hone in on what you wanna do with it. If youre into the more bureaucratic day to day motions of government public administration is an aspect you might want to focus on.If you have serious language skills access to foreign nationalities interest in internships abroadorganizations that work all over something like international relations would be a better thing to go for. If youre into the legal studies side of it it might be worth a shot doing some pre law courses and maybe kicking around the idea of law school if you really have a passion for it. Law school is still kind of a giant crap shoot in this current time and success with it comes to a number of factors. And so forth.Not to state obvious but its really about what you make of it and put into it. Its definitely not the kinda major you just wanna coast through and only chose because it sounds sexy and you watched some amazing Daily Show segment that changed your life.Its also not a degree you wanna get just to cement yourself as some know it all who get in fights with opposing people in your courses. I know that sounds random but as someone who did a poli sci degree there were a lot of clown shoes turds who just wanted to steal class time with these over the top soap box rants.Long story short I personally wouldnt say that political science necessarily yields a concrete number of jobs because it can be stretched over a lot of overlapping fields.I had a spark for research data analysis and campaign politics and had a gig surveying voter behaviors and other things. Ive also worked in media writing and editing pieces that involved coverage of political related events and got my foot into the door for film and broadcasting.

For example in Austin theres a huge tech scene so all marketing jobs would mostly have to be done for them whereas in Houston the medical industry out here is king. Most people find jobs through the plethora of hospitals out here so someone who wanted to get into marketing would probably have to get on in the business unit of a hospital. Lots of times these industries dont always post their jobs on job boards like indeed or Linkedin and you have to actually look up the companies and go looking through their careers portion. Outside of that Marketing is quite broad. You may be able to become more attractive as a candidate by learning the Adobe Suite of Software products.

8935214,0,t3_52o80g,First as someone who was a grad student once for several years some of those years living off of student loans and basically no income the payments on which are currently eating my paycheck I understand your plight. Not trying to trivialize it but its a difficult situation and I get it.Short answer yes you should include it on your resume also be sure youre submitting a traditional resume not an academic curriculum vitae for nonacademic jobs. You may need to spin your teaching experience a bit for job applications how you do it depends on the job. At the very least it should cover the interpersonal skills aspect of most jobs. Youve taught or at least helped students learn indirectly even if youre not doing lectures yourself so you can explain difficulttechnical things to laymen andor customersclients. Graded papers or pushed papers? Theres some administrativepaperworkattentiontodetail experience. Held office hours answered students incomprehensible emails late at night the day before an exam while doing your own work? Then youve worked in a fastpaced environment and multitasked.I could probably keep rambling but my general point is that you can broaden your skills beyond teaching for jobs that may not care about teaching. Dont worry about convincing a potential employer that youre an awesome teacher unless the job involves teaching youll get more out of being able to generalize what you can do.Afterthought edit Consider talking to your advisor or whoever youre assisting and other graduate students. I suspect perhaps incorrectly that you dont feel like you have much support and are turning to Reddit. Ive also been there. But if you havent reached out to anyone think about it. Youre not the only graduate student in your position and good faculty will help you out with this.

Even as a cook you could have signed on with caterers and gotten out into the field two or three times a week.  The pay isnt good but its an option.  Or you could have tried catering yourself though its a tough business.Delivery or trucking are options but some trucking jobs have crushing hours and no life left over.  Driving for a specific business doing deliveries  that might be better.  Or UPS.  There are guys who deliver for highend furniture stores and do assembly onsite or back at the ranch then deliver it and they seem like happy campers if their bosses arent evil. They see different people every day.Tow truck driver? Dont know the pay but think about it.  Even handyman work plumbing electrician all the trades. Theyre out and about all the time. House painting even work for somebody.  Theyre often doing two or three jobs at once.

9195975,0,t1_d8ga49b,I regularly have to remotely listen in to employees calls and assess their performance.I have since before getting on the management side have coached employees and part of my job is still coaching them in a constructive way. I have to work with other leads to get a variety of task done from daily assessments. The monthly assessments are to ensure our employees meet various minimum standards in terms of capability. Essentially that they are fast enough to do their job in a well controlled test where as the daily assessment is more of a spot check to make sure they are performing as well as expected live.Should an employee fail I have to go through a retrain process which can take  hours coaching them on how to properly deal with situations which resulted in them being noncomplaint.We prepare monthly reviews of any infractions their daily assessment average monthly assessment score and attendence along with productivity.Our center also allows people to reschedule missed hours to avoid being penalized as much when they miss which can be quite time absorbing.Other than that I also have to edit the break sheet to ensure it properly reflects the employees shift to make sure if they sign up for a bunch of OT they get proportionate breaks.Its also my responsibility to resolve any tech issues possible and forward whatever can not be fixed on the spot to IT. Admittedly Im a bit limited in this capacity because there is a lot more I could fix that I do not try to because of time reasons. There is also a lot of sending people to break as our call volume permits along with disconnecting calls which are not disconnecting properly on their own.Sorry if this isnt the most coherent but its been a long day.,jobs,d8hnoow,1,t5_2qhnd
9198148,0,t1_d8hsqan,Thanks heaps this really helps.What I put in my resume Research Assistant Institution  PresentSupervisor First ProfHandling strict deadlinesDoing stuff and things with other stuffDeveloping stuff for whateverAnd yes the situation is offer and acceptance he promises to meet to hash out details when he returns to the countrysettles in nothing further happens. I dont know why he never followed up he said hed email me  I honestly think he just forgot I should have found this out obviously.My only thought re explanation is that Job That Never Happened and the Job That Did Happen At The Same University are similar Same employerjob title central employment by uni title is Research Assistant Essentially same purpose preparing course materials for PhD courses Close dates Job That Never Happened supposed to start e.g. May Job That Did Happen started e.g. June. I could cast it as being essentially the same job with a switch of supervisorcourse. First Prof offered me the work I accepted the details were correct at the time of application before I started I changed to Second Profs course which started later because reasons involving Project At Uni B or alternatively due to indirectly discovering details of First Profs job were miscommunicated. Then its not job didnt exist its circumstances of job changed. Cons  Makes me look like a dummy Makes it my fault since I changed For this to work I would have to tell them about it in advance of the background check I think since it would be like FYI my circumstances changed.Pros  Everything in that explanation is true. If I tell them in advance then I can probably avoid getting the dreaded job X does not exist on the background check since they would theoretically check Job That Actually Happened although like you say I feel this makes me sound guilty.If you have any other suggestions it would be really appreciated or if you think that explanation is terrible or doesnt make sense  Im at my wits end. Thanks so much for helping me out  your advice is seriously invaluable.

These people are probably interviewing a few people around your age so try and stand out by being prepared and confident. Try not to uh too much or say you dont know the answer to their question. My first interview I was  too. The guy goes so where do you see yourself in  years? and I was stumped. I wanted to say finishing college starting my career but I didnt want him to think I was a flight risk or anything so I said I dont know. Turns out he guy wanted me to give my original answer because it shows that I think ahead. I didnt end up getting the job. So go with your gut when you get questions like this but practice if youre able.Theres a chance itll be a group interview. In which case all of this applies. Group interviews are a little stressful for me because Im shy and quiet but dont be like me. Dont worry about what anyone else being interviewed thinks.

Being a student and teachingcoachingtutoring is very different from advising which usually requires some real world corporate background knowledge of various resources outside of academia  and the overall maturity level that comes with that sort of thing.  Universities are also famous for nepotism and favoring hiringpromoting current staff over outside applicants so youre facing a double whammy.

Even if you are on clean up youll make about  and end up shown how to do drywall or something in a week or two. For more  a factory type job can be good. You might need a forklift cert. A welding factory is also a stable but boring job with little training. To get into welding you usually wany a  month course. A small computer repair or phone repair company if you have the knowledge is also a good idea for  years but you may want to look into actual courses to get out of it. Like more then your A.

He was fairly bright and seemed like a nice guy.At the start of the interview he let me know that he was expecting a call and that he may have to take it during the interview. Okay weird. But I actually respect someone who puts a family emergency in front of an interview.About  minutes in he gets the call I offer to leave the room and let him know to come grab me when he is free.About  minutes later I walk by and see him with his forehead on the table.  About  minutes after that he comes to grab me and hia face was all red.I asked if he was okay and let him know we could easily reschedule the rest of the interview if he needes to be somewhere. He insisted he was fine.We spent the next thirty minutes of the interview with him answering a few technical questions him bawling his eyes off and talking about loss of loved ones.  Apparently his dog was put down halfway through the interview and I had to spend thirty minutes that felt a lot more like a counseling session than a tech interview. He cried the whole time.I wish the guy had just rescheduled and I have no idea how he went onto another interview after me.He never responded to any of our HR emails.,jobs,dapfsbw,6,t5_2qhnd

9945330,0,t3_5hy7bz,I would just go with something standard along the lines of I am excited by the opportunity to come aboard as well but Im afraid the initial salary offer was lower than I expected.  I was expecting compensation closer to X amount.  Is there any flexibility to the offer amount?  Some people may disagree with throwing out a hard dollar figure as the concrete figure does invite the risk of either lowballing yourself or pricing yourself out of the job but asking for more compensation without a hard figure feels very passive to me.  I feel like it says to the hiring manager that I dont know what Im worth in this industry but I do know I want more money.  Id rather be upfront about what I think Im worth and be active in stating it through a welldefined amount.I wouldnt condition greater compensation on lack of relocation or use of public transport though.  The relocation money being in the budget does mean it probably is available for you to compete for but you want greater compensation because you are more valuable not simply because the money is technically available.  Changing from a narrative of you being valuable to a narrative of technicality like that is undermining and devaluing yourself.  Meanwhile commuting to work costs everyone money so unless were talking something considerably higher than the cost of gas and owning a car I think youll have a tough time getting coverage for public transport.,jobs,db3wgg1,2,t5_2qhnd

Youre supposed to use the degree as leverage for a promotionraisenew job whatever.The structure of the managers is irrelevant.As for your weekly meeting there isnt enough detail to conclude you are mismanaged. Unwritten standards and practices arent abnormal. And if nobody else is subject to them that just means your manager is more strict than others not that you are being mismanaged. Also that you spend so much time preparing for these meetings that you miss deliverables is more of a shortcoming on your end than the managers IMO.I wont touch the headphone thing.Anyway you ask if you are mismanaged and my answer from what youve said above is no.

10208156,0,t1_dc12tv4,gt Yep ever since  its been like that. It sucks aint getting better anytime soon. The problem is that this is the truth. And it is actually helpful to level with people on that point so they dont turn every last ounce of angst inward. How does that help a person get a job? By helping them stay grounded in reality. If they think the problem is just them then they can spin their wheels overanalyzing every single interaction. In reality what they need to do is calm the fuck down and work the numbers.Once you cover the basics finding a job like most saleswork is a numbers game. You have to keep your spirits up treat every lead skeptically not take shit personally and keep grinding. Failing to recognize the adverse environment can make that difficult ... bc again its either OP or the environment. If this were  then sure we would be discussing how to fix OP. But its not. Its . Shit is fucked. And OP just has to grind it out like everyone else. Theres also a valid and important argument to be made for collective political action in the direction of unfucking this economy.

Once the initial shock wears off some people take the news well others blow up some break down and cry etc.  If they try to talk to you during that time they could say something to trigger you blowing up or something that you turn around and use to sue them.  Same with that email response since at that time anything they say or do is now possible material for a lawsuit.  Ive had training from HR for firing employees where they flat out tell you say nothing but what we prepare for you.  if they asksay anything else redirect them to us. and they then warn and give horror stories of companies sued over someone saying something that sounded kind but was taken the wrong way so the person sued them. ,jobs,dc4vnjd,1,t5_2qhnd

Thank you for the offer and Im very excited about the opportunity. I did some research and it seems that hour is closer to the norm for this type of position with my experience. Can we get to that?The key to negotiating is to have a better alternative than the other person. So if the company can hire someone just as qualified as you for less pay they may decide to not increase the offer.

10522461,0,t3_5qnjc2,I would never take a counter offer.  I have seen too many times where someone gets a counter offer only to be jobless  months later.  Some employers just pay more to keep someone around in the short term and then cut them loose after they find a better and cheaper candidate. Here is what I would do.  If you are financially setup to lose your job in the next  months then take the counter offer.  This means you have an emergency fund setup and can shoulder being unemployed for  months depending on your area and the jobs available.  You can expect the best to happen if you do take this counter offer but plan for the worst.,jobs,dd0u20s,6,t5_2qhnd

From there you can read articles about the differences between say Facebook and Twitter and strategies you can utilize on each one. Google is your friend  When I took over the literary magazine we had a social media account but no one was doing much with it. Thats how I fell into managing accounts on Twitter and Facebook.Skills relevant in the marketing industry social media writingediting Google analytics content marketing blogging and InDesign and Photoshop. Depending on the job maybe photography HTML and graphic design skills as well.I think learning how to read your interviewer is important while searching for jobs.

But if youre not sure you should try to get them to agree to it ahead of time so you dont have to explain the discrepancy.If you ask ahead of time if its okay to put down kitchen staff on your resume they might agree to it something that innocuous they might even be pretty likely to agree to it. Its a casual conversation Hey boss since dishwashers fall under the kitchen staff category would it be okay if I put Kitchen staff on a future resume?Theres a very good chance reference checkers will directly ask your title.

10771439,0,t3_5u38ef,It is a pretty poor interview questions for all the strategies and theories out there on how to answer it but I will say that trying to be clever or witty here is more likely to backfire on you.  I get what youre saying about being the kind of lazy where you try to find the simplest or easiest way of doing things.  However its hard not to hear the underlying point about shortcuts and worry that you might cut corners at the wrong times.  In other words if laziness is really your weakness then the real consequence here is that sometimes the quality of your work suffers in your regular effort to take the easiest path.  Thats not what youre saying though.  Youre just wanting to say that youre efficient and mindful of opportunities to improve processes which is a good set of qualities but qualities that get lost in trying to outsmart this question.As I have said in other places I think its helpful to answer this question as if the question were actually asking What is something that doesnt come intuitively to you?.  It still pushes to share a possible vulnerability in your abilities but it more naturally sets you up to explain how you compensate for that lack of intuition.  ,jobs,ddqzt5u,6,t5_2qhnd

They called me in for a  Meet and Greet after an initial interview next day this morning and I was thinking ok thats good and that it would just be to see if I fit the culture. I ended up doing a whole redo of my first interview again with two new managers. It took me off guard plus I was then told Id be contacted and advised the HR I was dealing with wouldnt be seeing me as she was busy. So I felt dismissed and concerned at the change in behaviour wondering if I had lost my chance.Luckily for me I got a call to say I had the job.

10924631,0,t3_5vzgwq,For me there were two big classes of problems that make the job hunt more challenging than it needs to be.It is difficult to identify openings that I want to apply for.  In most job search tools restricting the displayed jobs to those that are within a comfortable commuting distance is difficult.  This issue is pronounced in large cities where commuting from one side of town to the other can be impractical.  As a result it can be difficult to assess the suitability of a job without researching the company and determining its location.Some search tools will display job postings for which applications are no longer being considered.  Applying to these is wasted time but not obviously so.Many job postings are sufficiently vague that it is not clear what the role actually involves or what it pays.  These problems probably cannot be solved but they remain an obstacle for job hunters.Some job postings are fake.  There is no job.  Applicants wont get hired but they might get spam.It is difficult to complete the applicationIf youve used the ubiquitous Taleo system you are aware of the general poor quality of those systems.  Many are poorly programmed to the point where an application cannot be completed because of erroneous or inscrutable error messages.  For me the time wasted was less of an issue the headaches generated were the bigger impediment to successful job hunting.Many applications ask too many questions which takes up a lot of time.  I understand that employers may want to conduct a background check before extending an employment offer but it is wasteful to demand that information at the stage where basic adequacy for the role is being assessed.,jobs,de6ssk9,5,t5_2qhnd

Youtube stars are disciplined have to make highquality material and amass huge crowds from their own ingenuity. You cannot just make videos you need to know how to edit them to track them to remix them and more. That requires you to take complex media classes audio classes etc. There will be terminology you MUST know and tests you MUST take and classes you MUST pass. It is in no way easy to be successful on youtube it takes a lot of effort especially if you plan to do it alone and go into it without proper education. And then to even gain recognition you need connection you may have to pay for publicity and build a rapport with hundreds of people before you even get any followers. You need an action plan to be successful on youtube or as a rapper and frankly if you do not have the discipline to at least get your GED then you will fail.

She did inpatient for about a month and it helped her tremendously and she got FMLA since it was doctorrecommended.Side note if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone or just vent please feel free to message me. Ive been going through depression myself and it makes me so sad that others are struggling while other people dont get how much of a struggle it can really be. ,jobs,df67d4z,16,t5_2qhnd

I also put it on my latest self appraisal form that I submitted. I have been applying to jobs everyday and this year I have been getting some calls and interest had one in person interview with one company and phone interviews with two others. Been applying for jobs for over a year with no luck in finding something better. Last year I had several interviews but no offers. Hoping this year I keep getting responses. Thanks again!,jobs,df6lpaa,2,t5_2qhnd

11264317,0,t3_60rk0o,The best you can try to opt for phone interviews. You can usually finagle this pretty easy especially if you make it seem impressive Im on a company paid trip to  where I am  that week so I will need to do that as a phone interview. Doing this will cut down on commute time. Assuming you can switch you lunch this means that you can do any phone interview if you are willing to relocate all the better. Second most companies call you first as a prescreen so keep yourself in bathroom distance at all times and dont be afraid to ask them to call you back.Third risky but Ive seen it work if youre able try to apply to a couple jobs inhouse. This will inform your boss about your ambitions and grease them a bit. Ive seen this work at my office. People who desperately want out will apply to a few inhouse jobs. They dont care when you transfer so then you say I got an interview for X position with the company where we all work and off your merry way to the real place. This cuts back on fake sickday excuses. Obviously this only works for big companies but all the better if hypothetically you would have to travel to another city to go to the fake interviewFourth you can totally use coworkers as references if it is a job at a new company. I worked for a onestop career center and ran a test on various hr people where I use myself as a reference. Of the  that claimed they would contact my references  did and none were the wiser for it.Source I used to work in a really Kafkaesque government department and people were always clamoring to get out of there.

11453630,0,t3_63gffb,Im sorry that happened to your wife. I say that your wife dodged a bullet and you both need to consider it a blessing. The fact that she got the initial cheery enthusiastic call from the manager only to be followed up by the district manager stating that the store manager didnt follow proper procedure is unsettling.Perhaps that was the reason for the managers change in demeanor. Maybe something was going on with her in relation to how she hastily called your wife but didnt go through the normal interview process. Maybe she was mad that the district manager stepped in and told her she jumped the gun. In my retail experience I have witnessed that instore management are not always friends with district managers so she may have been sour about that.Or...your assessment could very well be correct. The manager was disappointed that your wife wasnt what she...um...expected. Of course there is no way of proving that clearly a speculation. Not a surprising one but a speculation nonetheless.Whatever the case the whole scenario reeks of unprofessionalism. Red flag  was the call from the district manager saying the manager didnt follow procedure. The final nail in the coffin was the manager stumbling upon herself to backtrack when your wife came in for the interview.So to answer your question this whole setup most likely went sideways because of flawed human beings and good oldfashioned incompetence. As I just stated in a separate post in this same thread thats a common culture in the retail sector one reason Im trying desperately to get out of it.This shall pass. There are plenty of way better opportunities for your wife and she will find them. She need not let this experience get her down. Again consider it a blessing.

11549758,0,t1_dg55vn0,gtI agree with you that the standard authoritative exmilitary officer would be a nightmare to work for.I think you watch too much TV.  The hallmarks of military leadership are compassion good listening encouraging disagreement and always making sure people get what they need.I encountered a lot more flexibility when it comes to questioning assignments in the military than in the corporate world where leaders try and be bosses which is a different thing.I dont know where these stereotypes come from so Im assuming from Hollywood.  And thats because it would make boring movies to have senior officers saying Hi guys.  How is everyone feeling?  So our next assignment is tomorrow and I was wondering if any of you had any ideas of how we can do this better?  Because every single planning process I was ever involved in sounded like that.,jobs,dg5627a,4,t5_2qhnd

11577857,0,t3_65793h,I had a place call me while I was at the movies. I ran out of the theater to answer the phone but didnt pick it up in time.I called the number right back because I had an idea of who it was that was calling me. I explained that I missed the call so I was calling back. This was three or four minutes after they called me. She transfers me to the hiring manager and the manager said I was taken out of the pool of consideration because I didnt answer the phone a few minutes prior. I stated I was unable to answer the phone but I did call back immediately in which she said that doesnt really matter because applicants have to answer the phone in order to be considered. She told me to reapply in six months.After I got another job this place started calling me nonstop and asking me if I would like to come in for an interview...they were even leaving me voicemails saying they would like to set up an interview. So apparently the hiring manager was incorrect about me being taken out of the pool of applicants.Whatever the case its ridiculous for employers to expect you to answer the phone all the time. What if you are working? What if you are driving? I know in the age of cell phones we are tethered to communication but there still times when for various reasons we are unavailable.,jobs,dg8cu5y,15,t5_2qhnd

11578613,0,t1_dg8fj1c,Thats not how it works.  You hardly ever move from the technical back side theres a word for it in media and i cant think of it right now to the front side where directing and producing lies.Since you have no idea then I definitely have no idea.  Ill do my best to illustrate bothIf you want to do the technical aspect then school might help you.  Film school costs a shitload though so be ready.  You will learn about sound editing and video etc but its debatable on whether these skills can be learned on your own.I will tell you that film school is basically completely worthless for directing and producing.  If you want to get into that I recommend you start making content on Youtube that looks professional.  Maybe make some short films or docs and see where that gets you.  Be a lot better than  on film school.,jobs,dg8fxeo,1,t5_2qhnd
11586013,0,t3_65d3t8,Id do it immediately.  Sometimes recruiters just need that extra push to make something on their todo list higher priority. My bg check also went through hireright and took longer than expected but I needed to put in my two weeks asap so the moment I got the notification I emailed the recruiter something like Hi recruiter I hope all is well. I wanted to let you know that hireright notified me the bg check was completed and was sent to you for review. I wanted to confirm my start date of xx with you so please let me know when you have a chance to review the bg check. Id like to be able to give a full  weeks notice out of respect to my current employer so if you can give me the green light by tomorrow EOD that would be great. Thanks so much for your time and I really look forward to working with the company team!

11624593,0,t3_65v41a,First and foremost you cant compare PhDs in STEM like they are all the same so lets focus on computer science specifically.I dont believe there is any truth to the thought that PhDs are going to work more and get paid less. I also dont think that getting a good job is very difficult. However I think the real question and one that a lot of people miss when signing up for a PhD is whether or not the extra  years of school are going to increase your income potential or job prospects enough to make up for  years of lost adultlevel income.If the answer is no which I think is the case for most PhDs then the question is why do it? The reason maybe the only reason you should do a PhD is because of the types of jobs it will open up not because of the money. Doing a PhD for the money is a bad call. Doing a PhD because it will get you into more advanced work that is incredibly challenging and in the meantime give you job security because very few people will have that skillset is worth it.There is a posting currently in rdatascience where someone is struggling with being a PhD right now  I suggest you read that thread.All that to say ask yourself why you are doing a PhD. Is the answer money? Then dont do it. It is unlikely that you will get a positive ROI relative to getting a masters and working.What a lot of people forget about is that someone smart enough to finish a PhD is more likely than not smart enough to achieve success of the same magnitude albeit potentially in different forms regardless of career path.,jobs,dgdnqur,10,t5_2qhnd
